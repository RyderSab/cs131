It is right up Sterling's alley-the individual against the state, and his right to revolt.<br /><br />Of course this book has elements of other dystopian literature:  big government and small humans, retrograde technology, and state control of life, liberty, and sex.  This seems like a rehash of the usual works (\\"The Iron Heel,\\" \\"THX-1138,\\" \\"Logan's Run, \\" \\"Harrison Bergeron\\"), but keep in mind it was written in 1937, five years AFTER \\"Brave New World,\\" and  eleven years BEFORE \\"1984.\\"<br /><br />In fact, this book in many ways surpasses Orwell's classic.  Being a novella, it is crisper, punchier, and more to the point. It has less deadwood (the sex scene are allusions), and focuses on the moral aspects of an omnipresent state that has eliminated the word \\"We.\\"<br /><br />That is the key. Eleven years before Appleforth refused to eliminate the word \\"God,\\" the World Council had eliminated the word \\"I.\\"  For day to day activity, that is like removing the letter \\"e.\\"  Throughout the narrative, which is written in first person, Equality 7-2521  keeps referring to himself as \\"we.\\"<br /><br />This makes for awkward reading, since we do not know if he is along or with Liberty 5-3000, or anyone else. But that is point: the objective of the World Council is to eliminate the concept of individuality in order to cement control over society.<br /><br />You do not need a whole Newspeak dictionary if you can eliminate this one word for the vocabulary. This one small change makes all the difference.<br /><br />*<br /><br />The only drawback is that Peikoff included the galley prints of Rand's revision of the First Edition. This uselessly doubles the size of the book, but it is an important insight for fans of Rand and those who are aspiring writers.  If you liked \\"Romantic Manifesto\\" and \\"The Art of Fiction,\\" buy this book. You see Rand's mind in action.	2005-10-12

But you do have to admit that she is one the world's clearest thinkers.  She not only knows what she believes, but she also knows how to explain it, and explain it very well.  This is exceptional when you consider that English is a second language.<br /><br />Moreover, her main qualification is writing the second-most influential book in America, with the Bible being number 1, \\"The Road Less Traveled\\" at 4, \\"Lord of the Rings\\" at 5, and \\"The Book of Mormon\\" at 8. That is no small feat, considering that \\"Atlas Shrugged\\" is over a thousand pages long, and beat out \\"Gone With The Wind,\\" \\"Man's Search For Meaning,\\" and \\"To Kill M Mockingbird.\\"<br /><br />She covers the four topics of theme, plot, characterization, and style, and uses her keen mind to analyze the critical elements.  You get a good feel for how good a writer Rand is when you compare her streamlined prose with Thomas Wolf's raunchy vomiting.<br /><br />There is nothing new, per se, in this book.  She has the gift of getting to the essence of an issue.  She also covers twice as much information in about half the page space.  You do not get bogged down in verbal circumlocutions.<br /><br />I would suggest reading this book, then reading \\"Philosophy: Who Needs It?\\" and then \\"The Romantic Manifesto.\\" There are deep ideas behind her faction, and this book is a summation of her intellectual point of view.  As a Mormon, I disagree with much of her philosophy.  However, if someone has a good idea, I am honor bound to recognize it.  \\"If there is anything virtuous, lovely, or of good report or praiseworthy, we seek after these things.\\"<br /><br />Rand's strength is that she is operating from a philosophic point of view.  We really do not have philosophic fiction writers, outside of C. S. Lewis, Nietzsche and Sartre.  This is not to say that other authors do not have ideas, but that they are not operating from a certain point of view.  This is why Rand is so engaging: instead of presenting a mental muddle, she actually has a point to what she writes.  Hence her precision in language.ors do not have ideas, but that they are not operating from a certain point of view.

I definitely did not want a gore fest, bored nihilism, or mere milieu.  I was quite surprised with the book.  It reads more like a detective novel, akin to Kolchak or the X-files.<br /><br />What makes this book interesting is the format. The chapters are really selections from journal and news clippings.  Thus, the book is written in the first person, which always enhances believability.  However, Stoker takes it to the next level as we read the journals of the several characters.  We see events through the eyes of Harker, Mina, Dr. Seward and, of course, Van Helsing.  Part of the fun (and occasionally the fatigue) is trying to connect the events into a synthetic whole.  As a historian, this is my bread and butter.<br /><br />Stoker is also a master of setting.  As Harker approaches Castle Dracula, You can feel the air and smell the fear.  The wonderful images from \\"Nosferatu\\" glimmered before my minds eye.  Another powerful aspect is the religious setting, which was abandoned in the \\"Blade\\" movies. Not only do you fight Drac with garlic and a cross, but communion wafers are also powerful weapons. They are used to sterilize the dirt in Drac's coffins, and as part of magic circles.<br /><br />Probably the most surprising thing was to see how the character of Dracula has been amended and substantially weakened in his various translations.  In this book (in the very windy expository passages from Van Helsing), we lean that Dracula can change himself into a bat, a wolf, or even dust, mist or a moonbeam. He also has a limited weather control.<br /><br />In this sense, the story is unbalanced-\\"Bambi Versus Godzilla.\\" We have a crowd of dense mortals going up against this powerful demon.  I felt fearful, and wanted Doc Savage or Sherlock Holmes to step in and rescue them, since they were quite slow on the uptake.  However, this just added to the story's tension.<br /><br />The book has three weaknesses.  Dracula's characterization is flat.  He seems to be more like a force of nature than a menace, which blunts the horror. It feels more like London's \\"To Star A Fire\\" than Starling going up against Hannibal Lector.  There is a sense of danger, but no sense of psychological engagement.  Although he gave the heroes a run for their money, Drac is wily, but not intelligent.<br /><br />The second is the repetition.  The multiple visits to Lucy's crypt and the three blood transfusions could have been eliminated with no loss to the story and a great gain to the pacing. Eliminating the deadwood frees up the mind of reader to piece the story together form the various journals.  That is why \\"Man of La Mancha\\" has been seen more times than \\"Don Quixote\\" has been read.<br /><br />The third is the crowd.  Too many useless characters clutter the plot. Arthur, Quincy, and Renfield are props, and Lucy's thread could be eliminated, sine we have the same idea with Mina's transformation.<br /><br />There is a fourth flaw, but this is really a quibble.  Drac is dusted on November 6th.  It would have been more appropriate-and I was expecting-for him to be killed on Halloween.<br /><br />Excusing these three flaws and one quibble, this book is truly a classic and a masterpiece of the horror genre.  It is a great Jack-o-Lantern stuffer..  Dracula's characterization is flat.  He seems to be more like a force of nature than a menace, which blunts the horror.

For a staccato explanation for various ideas, this is book is yours.<br /><br />Part of the book's charm is that Blackburn follows Norma Schur's lead by including humor and wise-cracking editorials on some philosophic issues. This lubricates what would otherwise dry dictionary.<br /><br />IMHO, there are two omissions. First, I would have included an entry on Ayn Rand. Blackburn makes the ROTFLOL assertion that Willard Quine is \\"the most influential American philosopher of the latter half of the Twentieth Century\\" (p. 315).  First, Quine is a logician and not a philosopher in the formal sense of the word. Secondly, \\"Atlas Shrugged\\" is the number two bestselling book in the US, and Rand's Objectivist thought has influenced two important movers and shakers: Alan Greenspan and Rush Limbaugh.<br /><br />The second omission was C. S. Lewis.  He is the greatest Christian philosopher since Calvin. Not only was he a Christian philosopher, he was a philosopher in the strict sense of the word. His writings covered the traditional broad philosophic battlegrounds: epistemology, metaphysics, politics, economics, ethics and aesthetics.<br /><br />I'm Mormon, not Objectivist or Anglican, so I have serious intellectual disagreements with both Rand and Lewis.  However, I do recognize the influence these two thinkers have had on the world, and would have appreciated entries on both of them.<br /><br />Another question I have is on entry size. Kant gets two double columned pages, while both Plato and Aristotle get about two columns, or one page of data, and Socrates (our mental godfather) gets one column, or half a page, similar in length to Nietzsche or Marx.  I think the most disturbing entry on philosophy, which does not even get a full column of text, which is the length of the entry on Noam Chomsky.<br /><br />I make a point of this since in a book like this, space is at a premium.  I realize that the comeback to this is that the whole book itself is about philosophy.  However, It would have been more helpful to have a longer entry on philosophy, explaining the theoretical underpinnings, aims and objectives of philosophy, and difference between \\"philosophy as the search for truth\\" versus \\"philosophy as a collection of what people said.\\"<br /><br />Keeping these caveats in mind, I recommend this book as a great survey and introduction to the \\"Enterprise of the Mind.\\"self is about philosophy.

This is billed as a continuation of the Lensman saga, and a story about Worsel.  The first is true; the second isn't.<br /><br />In this era of Star Wars: Expanded Universe, and endless Star Trek novels, not to mention the Brian Herbert's prequels, and pre-prequel Dune novels, you get used to other people wanting to build upon others ingenuity.  Occasionally, as in the case of the novelization of Revenge of the Sith, and in ST:TNG \\"Q-Squared,\\" you get surprising winners.  However, most of the time, to books read like a mediocre episode of the series.<br /><br />It is not that Kyle has big shoes to fill. Rather, he has quirky shoes that are several decades out of style.  You can forgive Doc Smith for writing pulp because he was a bona fide pulp writer.  Kyle, however, has a better soul, prose, and style that does not flow well with Doc Smith's.<br /><br />In some ways, this is an improvement.  Doc could get word and awk-\\"wordy\\" at times.  The pacing was too quick at times, and the breezy slang can be like reading another language.  This slows the modern reader down.<br /><br />I think Kyle has only two problems. One, he tweaks the Lensman continuum too much.  With 29 of 6 not getting the regenerative treatment that was already established \\"Second Stage Lensman,\\" it was a hefty discontinuity.  Since this is a main character, it did not seem believable.<br /><br />Then there is the problems of el-sike, a purely Kyle invention which doe not flow out of the original Doc cannon.<br /><br />Second, you could feel the influence of other SF in this book-Pok reminded me of the Death Star, Arrow-22-a here-and-gone character-was Hal 9000 with a stutter.<br /><br />The last and biggest problem is that this story is not about Worsel, but about Kallatra.  The Old Snake is the point of view character, but he is not the main character, in the same way that Holmes provides the POV, with Sherlock the main charter.  The resolution of the plot hinges upon Kallatra.  Consequently, she steals all of Worsel's potential thunder.  The Snake is more of a mentor (no pun intended), with Kinnison and Mentor being redundant beings.<br /><br />I find Kallatra a very disturbing character. She appears out of nowhere, is the central being to the plot, and undergoes an agonizing near death with the entire Galactic Patrol and Lensman Corps looking on in awe.  In short, she is a MARY SUE character.<br /><br />So . . . if you are a die hard Lensman fan, buy the whole trilogy to round out your collection. But do not expect the same type of book. It is an easier read, but not as good a story.uently, she steals all of Worsel's potential thunder.

The book has its good points: the readable language, the actual enumeration of hardware, the use of sci-fi as an \\"other-worldy\\" setting to deal with contemporary issues (class structure, Darwinism, Utopianism, the absurdity of some forms of war), and quaint and lovable characters.<br /><br />This books main flaw is structure.  The book is really three stories: first, the events associated with the voyage to and return from the moon, which is really a book in its own right. The second part is a very odd (and pointless) account of Bedford reintegrating himself in Terran society.  The third part is the messages from Cavor, which is a separate book, but is unconnected to the other two parts.  The first book is a nice Victorian-pre pulp adventure story; the second half is a mish-mash of biting social commentary and back-story.<br /><br />By back-story, I mean we are reading about Selenite sociology, biology, etc information in a large dissociated lump.  It is like I am reading the appendix to \\"Lord of the Rings.\\"  It would have been better to have woven this information into the body of the first book.  In \\"The Time Machine,\\" Wells gives us the Moorlock-Eloi symbiosis as part of the discovery in the whole narrative.<br /><br />As it stands, the book is a mediocre adventure story, with no ultimate purposes and point.  Once the adventure is resolved, with Bedford coming back to earth, the book should have ended. Maybe had an appendix or last chapter with the reintegration, what Joseph Campbell calls \\"Crossing the Return Threshold.\\" But to go into obscenely minute detail of Bedford eating eggs is rather tedious reading.  Furthermore, it is pointless to the overall plot.<br /><br />The Selenites have a fascinating social order, but that is never developed in the narrative, and is tacked on in the rambling exposition chapters.  By contrast, Burroughs gives us a good sampling of the Martian social order in his John Carter books, with the hero becoming an integral part of the alien order.<br /><br />In fact, I would have executed the story in a way similar to the John Carter of Mars books.  Wells is a great thinker and a genius.  He can write better, and does in the Time Machine.  This book, however fascinating it is, flops.  Wells parted the Red Sea when he should have walked on water.th the hero becoming an integral part of the alien order. <br /> <br />In fact, I would have executed the story in a way similar to the John Carter of Mars books.

Cannon admits that he is fascinated by Reagan (p. ix), but it seems to be the fascination of sadist.  It is obvious that he does not like Reagan, and the chapter layout proves this.  For example, Regan's earliest and most decisive victory, the firing of the ATC Worker, is achronologically treated in Chapter 17, which is on the relection.  He devotes an entire (and very tedious) chapter to Regan's visit to Bitburg Cemetery (Chapter 18), and then two whole chapters to Iran-Contra (19-20). The weirdest mix may be Chapter 8, begins a discussion of Reagan's humor and then deteriorates into a discussion of Reagan's mental processes.<br /><br />Moreover, he devotes one and a half paragraphs on page 91 to discuss the assassination attempt, and does not even mention John Hinckley by name, which he finally does on page 156 and later on page 164, in the context of Alex Haig's meltdown.  This is tantamount to writing a biography on Lincoln, and paraphrasing the Gettysburg Address.<br /><br />I thought Chapter 8, \\"Kidding on the Square\\" paled in comparison to Peggy Noonan's similar treatment in \\"When Character Was King,\\" Chapter 14.  Cannon includes two of Reagan's off-color jokes that Noonan only alludes to, which just reveals more of his iconoclasm.<br /><br />This books biggest flaw is that there is no Reagan in it.  It is almost all context to Reagan, but you see very little of the man.  You get exposed to people's reactions to Reagan, but never given inside the man.  This is because Cannon rarely quotes Reagan himself.  He manages to talk around his subject, with nimble dexterity, but four chapters into the book, you get the feeling something is missing.<br /><br />BEFORE YOUR READ THIS BOOK, I suggest you read three others.  First, Read Michael Reagan's quote book on his father, \\"In the Words of Ronald Reagan.\\"  The second would be \\"Speaking My Mind,\\" Reagan's collection of his favorite speeches.  Given in chronological order, they give you a better sense of what happened, what Reagan himself thought was important bout his presidency. This gives you a better sense of time that Canon obscures (i.e. talking about the ATC strike in the same chapter as his reelection-quite a Wrinkle in Time).  The last would be the aforementioned Noonan biography, which is really a moral history of the man.  Then tackle Cannon's book and see his flaws.a better sense of what happened, what Reagan himself thought was important bout his presidency.

Admittedly they are long, through, and have wonderful cover at. But the content is what disturbs me.  Not the entire content, but just three things.<br /><br />The first snag is that Cannon does not like Reagan.  He clearly admits this in-in his footnotes:<br /><br />\\"It was the only time Reagan ever complimented me on anything I write.\\" (Governor, 311n)<br /><br />This quote sums up the books main negative bias. This book is a history of Reagan as filtered through Cannon's philosophical grid.  This makes for a tedious read.  He takes Reagan on Lou Cannon's terms.  Maybe that is why Cannon had a weekly column that included \\"Reaganisms,\\" (President, 102n).<br /><br />Cannon is, however, fascinated by him.  He freely admits this in the 1991 preface to President Reagan. This provides a positive bias, which saves the book from being a multi-volume hit piece.<br /><br />The second snag, is the books are almost all context. It is always \\"Reagan And\\": Reagan and Unruh, Reagan and Meese, Reagan and Reagan, and Reagan and Nancy. But we never see Reagan as an individual.<br /><br />The Gipper's tag-line is the Great Communicator, but Cannon rarely quotes him.  This sucks the life out of the Regan magic.  Read Michael Reagan's quote book on his father and then read this book. It is like seeing two different men.  One is a lively and deep thinker; the other is a vague buffoon.  But will the real Ronald Regan please stand up?<br /><br />Reagan also had a gift for humor.  Peggy Noonan observed that Reagan had \\"an encyclopedic memory for jokes.\\" (When Character Was King, 228).  However, Cannon, in his chapter on Reagan's humor, talks about his humor in the abstract and recounts his juicier ethnic jokes (President, 101-102).<br /><br />The last snag is in the area of analogy.  The second book is subtitled \\"The role of a Lifetime.\\"  His rhetorical device is to cast Reagan merely as an actor who gets the chance to play a president.  This is a combination of \\"I'm not a president, but I play one on TV\\" and the plot to the film \\"Dave.\\"<br /><br />Hover, this rhetorical device affects his logic.  David Hackett Fischer calls this \\"the fallacy of insidious analogy\\" (\\"Historians' Fallacies,\\" 244ff). The problem is that Cannon's analogy takes over his writing. It also become contradictory at times.<br /><br />For example, Chapter six of the presidential book discuses what Canon calls \\"the script.\\" What he means by the script is the core philosophical ideas that Reagan had that attracted the voters.  Cannon freely admits, \\"But it was the script that was compelling, and it was Reagan who wrote it.\\" (President, 66).  Then in later chapters he speaks of Reagan taking direction and needing a director (President, Chapter 10,  p. 25,  32, 116, ).<br /><br />Cannon may misunderstand the necessity of delegation.  The role of the president is to be the leader. That is, he articulates the vision, and then empowers his staff and cabinet to implement the vision.  That is why he said, \\"\\"Surround yourself with the best people you can find, delegate authority and don't interfere as long as the policy you've decided is carried out.\\" (President, 150).  Ill timed or not, it is not only sound advice, it is the only way to run a country.  A micromanager could not last three second as president.<br /><br /> To be sure, Reagan may not have done follow-up as well as he should have, but he did understand the genius of individual people.  He was not just remaking country, but truing everyone into demi-gods by empowering them.<br /><br />I think I have said enough, but there is one comment that just grates me. In Chapter 9 of the president book, Canon describes the rise and fall of the M/X missile.  During one Cabinet meeting, Regan showed up with a cartoon of Uncle Sam playing as hell-game with Brezhnev. This clinched the issue for Reagan. (President, 138).  Cannon conclude the chapter saying that Reagan was a \\"president who skimped on preparation, avoided complexities and news conferences, and depended far too heavily on anecdotes, charts, graphics, and cartoons.\\" (President, 140)<br /><br />Cannon forgets that Reagan had an intuitive sense of people, and was able to connect without the use of the Cabinet and Bureaucracy (President, 119).  One obvious was he did that was by listening to them.  Another way was attuning himself to the humor.  Cannon forgets the power of humor and that George burns said, \\"Truth is the basis of all good comedy.\\"(Governor, 107).  That one political cartoon illustrated a truth that would do honor to Socrates or Kierkegaard.  For Cannon, the medium was the message. End of story.<br /><br />The gubernatorial book is the better book.  Cannon does not feel the need to cover as much as he does in the Presidential book (Some of the material is redundant).  The Presidential one has long chapters that sometimes get muddled. Chapter 8 covers Reagan's humor and thought patterns, and Chapter 11 covers Regan's early life-kind of late in the book for that.  Also, Hinckley  isn't mentioned by name in the narrative about the assassination, which is covered in half a paragraph, and then resumed in the narrative about the melt-down of Alex Haige.<br /><br />What would have helped this book?  First of all, Cannon needs to sort out what he really thinks about Reagan. He is fascinated and even at times charmed by Reagan. But it is a love-hate relationship.  Cannon disagrees with Reagan politically and philosophically. It is almost like Canon is afraid of Regan and feels the need to cut him down a notch.<br /><br />Canon makes the comment that Reagan may have never read E. B. White (President, 97).  I suggest the same for Cannon: Remember Strunk and White's first rule of Composition: Place Yourself in the background (Strunk and White, 70).<br /><br />Secondly, \\"Check your premises.\\"  Figure out why you have this attraction to reign, and name concretes.

I think reading this book in tandem with \\"Basic Economics\\" with help round out both books.  \\"Applied Economics\\" seeks to take the elementary principles laid out and take them to real life situations.  Specifically, Sowell denounces economic \\"Stage One\\" thinking, which deals with on the short-term, or only immediate consequences of political/economic polices.  He shows how the basic principles of comics affect things not only at stage one, but also stages, 2 to infinity.<br /><br />In other words, Sowell wants us to think-to avoid the short-term, almost amoebic \\"stimulus-response\\" level of political rhetoric.  He wants us to think about the long-term consequences of what we do, and the incentives we actually create, rather than goals we hope to accomplish.<br /><br />And in that he succeeds.	2005-03-24

Sowell has a wonderful gift, like Aristotle and C. S. Lewis, to distill his explanations to the bare essentials.  Every sentence and every word count.  That is why he is hard reading.  Not because he is foggy, but because is rock solid.<br /><br />I think he covers every aspect of economics in the rudiments.  The table of contents reveals that he has rethought the basics, and his approach is radically different from the Cliff's Notes on Economics and is almost the direct opposite of the Complete Idiot's Guide to Economics.  If Sowell seems topsy-turvy, it is because everyone else is upside-down.<br /><br />For example, he starts out with the definition of economics (the study of the use of scare resources with alternative uses), and restates this definition in every chapter of the book.  That is, he is fixes his book with fixed principles.  He never looses track of what he is doing, even when discussing the absurdities of current economic policies.<br /><br />I have only three criticisms:<br /><br />First, in explaining scarcity, his definition is adequate, but it stops short of perfection.  Scarcity is a metaphysical principle, like gravity or an inclined plain.  It is not a \\"construct\\" or an a priori assumption of capitalism.  By switching economic systems, such as communism or barter, does not change the fundamental problem of scarcity any more than moving from communalism to feudalism solves the problem of water freezing at 32 degrees.  Regardless of the organizational superstructure, the scarcity remains, in the same way as the sound barrier remains in the different systems.<br /><br />In this regards, economics more like physic or chemistry, rather than psychology or literature.  We have this unalterable problem of scarcity which is really a double problem: the scarce resources have two or more uses, increasing their scarcity. It is not a discussion of Guns and Butter, but of Milk and Cheese . . .  and Yogurt, and Curds, and so forth.<br /><br />Second, in explaining competition, he should differentiate between competition and competitiveness.  One is a metaphysical principle; the other is a personality trait.  Competition is a fundamental principle that must be dealt with, the same way we have to take chemical flash-points and light-speed into account.  The Communist Revolution did not solve the problem of competition-in fact, it aggravated it since communism  is less efficient than the free-market.<br /><br />Competition is bothersome at times, but it has a purpose, like friction.  Imagine what it would be like to walk without friction pushing us forward.  It is because there is no resistance in space that astronauts have special tools that take this lack of resistance into account.  Just picture hitting a nail in space, and then having Newton's First Law becoming operative.<br /><br />Likewise, competition provides a necessary opposition in the economic realm that is essential to choice.  Microsoft and Apple are both better companies because of this opposition, not to mention McDonald's and Wendy's, and Hertz and Budget.  Ultimately it is the consumer that benefits from this opposition or competition, which allows for precious choice, freedom and agency to flourish.<br /><br />Competition, or opposition, goes even deeper.  Aristotle observed that people who believe that there are no opposites, such as opposite ideas in competition, then they would be no better than vegetables (Metaphysics 1005b35-1006a30). If there was no opposition, then all things would be a large compound entity, simultaneously alive and dead, happy and sad, free and slaves.  It would bring us back to the singularity that the scientists exited before the Big Bang occurred.<br /><br />The third critique is an extension of the difference between competition and competitiveness, namely the nature of evil in economics.  In almost all of his chapters, Sowell mentions the idiotic policies that come from Stage-One thinking.  However, he never quite centers on evil, or pride and irrationality.  These buffoon-policies are put in place, and it is traced to the short incentives, but what drives people to think ONLY in short-term incentives?<br /><br />Remember that C. S. Lewis observed that it was in bureaucratic-type setting that you get evil:<br /><br />\\"The greatest evil is not done now in those sordid 'dens of rime' that Dickens loved to paint. It is not even done in concentration camps and labor camps. In those we see its final result. But it is conceived and ordered (moved, seconded, carried and minuted) in clean, carpeted, warmed, and well-lighted offices, by quiet men with white collars and cut fingernails and smooth-shaven cheeks who do no need to raise their voice.\\"<br /><br />There is something deeper than short-term consideration of incentives.  There is something that drives Gray Davis to manage the 2001 Electrical Crisis the way he did, and why Californians reelected him, and then recalled him 2003.<br /><br />Think about the people with multi-chilion dollar consumer credit card debt.  Why all of this insane consumption?<br /><br />This is a difficult subject.  I suggest Peck's \\"People of the Lie,\\" Lewis's \\"Screwtape Letters,\\" and \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" as a starting point. And we cannot forget the Bible and \\"Paradise Lost.\\"<br /><br />This is not a critique, but a suggestion. It would be helpful to have a glossary, and also a series of bullet-points.  I know that Sowell intended this book to be popular, and eliminated equations and graphs.  Stephen Hawking did the same in \\"A Brief History of Time,\\" but he did include E=mc2.  Similarly, it would have been helpful to have a grid explaining the relationship between high prices, high supply and low demand, and low prices, low supply and high demand.<br /><br />Another help would be a battery of key questions:  What and where is the scarcity?  Where is the supply?  Where is the demand? What are the alternative uses?  What are the most efficient uses?  What happens in Stage 1, Stage 2, Stage 3, etc?  What are the prices?<br /><br />Outside of these critiques, the book is flawless.  I appreciated Sowell's including study questions at the end.

This book is not an introduction to Rand's Objectivism.  Rather, it is a summery, or distillation of what Ayn Rand taught.  For those curious about her Objectivism, I would STRONGLY recommend beginning with \\"Philosophy: Who Needs It?\\"  If you can stomach what she says, then read the core texts of \\"The Virtue Of Selfishness,\\" \\"Capitalism: The Unknown Ideal,\\" \\"The Romantic Manifesto,\\" all in parallel with reading \\"Atlas Shrugged.\\"<br /><br />Peikoff has two limitations. First, his writing is not at the level of Rand's.  He gets the ideas across, and is very readable, but he does not have Rand's magic.  His better essays are found in \\"The Voice of Reason.\\"<br /><br />Secondly, Peikoff is retelling Rand.  He is not speaking from his heart, but merely trying to explain what she said.  His writing seems a bit dark because he is standing in her shadow.  As Bruce McConkie said, \\"Don't drink below the horses.\\"  If you want to study Rand, then study Rand, and not Peikoff.<br /><br />The book's main weakness, however, is not that it is a summery, but that it is not philosophy.  Peikoff is not philosophizing, but pushing the brand name of Ayn Rand's Objectivism.  This is a subtle shift.  When you read Rand's earlier essays, you get the feeling that she was \\"calling it as she saw it.\\"  Peikoff, however, is calling it as Ayn Rand saw it.<br /><br />Of course, we all appeal to some authority.  But philosophy is not a survey of what people have said, but a survey of what is true.  By emphasizing Rand's Objectivism as a solution, he undermines her philosophy as a solution.  If Objectivism is objectively true, then it does not belong exclusively to one person.  Hence, Peikoff cannot be an \\"authorized\\" exponent of Objectivism.  If Objectivism is objectively true, then we are all Objectivists.<br /><br />Having said this, I would suggest this book as a summery of Rand's Objectivism.  Read after you have read the four core books, since it laces up all the ideas and will coalesce your thinking on Rand's and Peikoff's thinking.sce your thinking on Rand's and Peikoff's thinking. <br />	2005-03-10
US	50147915	R269TXL609ORKQ	193108193X	666019330	An Open Book: Poems	Books	4	18	20	N	N	It's a sin to review a book of poetry after one reading.	This slim collection has sixty-nine of Card's poems.  If there is any problem, it is that there is no real cohesion: he admits in the afterward that they are a sampling of things he has been off-and-on tinkering with for many years now.  Consequently, they do not have a specific message or theme.  In fact, Card's approach in the selection is a bit nihilistic, or at least impulsive:<br /><br />\\"So this open book is a collection of the poems I happened to choose for publication at this time, in the form I happen to prefer at the moment.\\" (p. 93)<br /><br />This impulsivity, in a way, weakens the selection.  With the loss of two of his children (1997 and 2000), many of the poems reflect this devastating loss. For a slice in time, it is essential that the emotion be captured, but for a long-term book, such as this one, it gives Card a darker tint that does not reflect his normal optimism.<br /><br />We get three death poems in a row: \\"He Died of Cystic Fibrosis at 24,\\" \\"Prayer in the ICU,\\" and \\"Grandma in the Corner, Dying.\\"  That is a bit too much, and was more like a speed-bump in the text.  A better solution?  Probably subdivide \\"Section One: Hunger, Love, and Death\\" into three separate subsections.  This brackets the death poems, and would dull the impression that Card is a crypto-Goth.<br /><br />These poems are not all gloomy, however.  \\"Needle,\\" for example, makes an analogy between a stiff body and a compass needle.  That is, death is a direction, a part of living a life that is \\"true north.\\"<br /><br />The attention-grabbing poem was \\"In Touch\\":<br /><br />\\"They say the extended family is dead<br />Everybody's gone nuclear<br />With fission and fusion at random intervals<br />We desperately staple on names with a hyphen.\\"<br /><br />Perfect.  We get social critic, observational comic and terse wordplay all in space of four lines.  The idea of family break up is crystallized in a novel way, with the memorable puns of \\"nuclear family\\" undergoing fission and fusion.<br /><br />Another phrase that keeps mentally surging is \\"my white secret shadow\\" from \\"Holy Moments.\\"  Don't you feel like you have this white shadow, the better angel of our nature that keeps coming to us?  Card is not morbid, and despite having lost two children in the space of five years has not snuffed his soul.  There is optimism.<br /><br />Card also included two poems from the Science Fiction point of view.  His poem \\"Tin Men\\" is a rebuttal to the space operas of Doc Smith, Roddenberry, and Lucas.<br /><br />\\"And when we set our hands<br />To killing evil at its source,<br />We traced it through its tortuous course:<br />We found it shyly hiding in our glands\\"<br /><br />By the way, \\"loop\\" in the first lines refers to the lifeloops in \\"The Worthing Saga\\"<br /><br />The other poem is \\"The Man Who Came Back from the Lunar Colony.\\"  It describes a person leaving a colony, and having to adjust to earth life.  But it is exactly the type of thing a person WOULD write if he was a poet and had come from a lunar colony.  He thoroughly understands the Sci-Fi genre, and has uncovered a delightful corner in the milieu.<br /><br />The oddest selection is \\"Fire At The End OF The World: Nonscriptural Verses.\\"  It is two chapters discussion the encounter of a BYU student (I assume Seventh and University to be in Provo, along with the university branch), meeting an apocalyptic religious crackpot and how it affects her life.  I'm not sure what it is, or what it means, but merely by its format, it stands out.<br /><br />My favorite poem is a toss-up between \\"Elves,\\" the poem on aging that reminds me of Chesterton's essay on \\"The Ethics of Efland,\\" or \\"Jacob Smith of Somerset,\\" a delightful vision of Genealogy.  This is free-verse poetry, as opposed to the didactic rhyme that we usually get in Home Teaching visits.<br /><br />If you can make the move from rhyme to poetry, then you will enjoy this collection.t shadow\\" from \\"Holy Moments.\\"  Don't you feel like you have this white shadow, the better angel of our nature that keeps coming to us?

Joseph Campbell speaks of the Hero Cycle involving many things, such as a dismemberment or crucifixion being associated with the threshold crossing.  As the trio enters the volcano, there is nothing horrendous about their passage.  There is no \\"elixir theft,\\" although Arne Saknusemm's dagger could have fit the bill.  Lastly, there is no real character development.  You have the clash and tension between Harry and the Professor: young-old, scientist-novice, driven-reluctant.  But there is not enough to drive the story, and no enchantment.<br /><br />There are some mythic elements, but they seem a bit haphazard.  They exit the earth, the \\"belly of the whale,\\" by way of a torrent and lava, the Masonic fire and water trial.  IT pushes them out and up, in a mock rebirth.  Then they land in paradisiacal Italy, contrasting with cold and dead Iceland.  This is the motif of a \\"sacred grove,\\" but it is never utilized fully.<br /><br />Furthermore, there are some structural problems. Specially, Verne has two backtracks. The first is in Chapter 18, when they take the wrong road, and then Chapter 33, with the storm blowing the raft back to the starting point.  Aesthetically, this is wonderful parallelism, but by the time you get to the discovery and the back track, you feel cheated.  All the reading you have done up to that point was pointless.<br /><br />The ending is rushed, and the denouement seems like a slipknot at times.  I would have preferred a bit drawn out enduing and the possibility of a sequel.  After all, who is Arne Saknusemm, and is there more to mysterious and even Christic figure?  He is a Buddha, an enlightened one who leads the way for other to follow as they go through the underworld that is middle earth.<br /><br />It is Verne's second book, so he is still in the process of becoming \\"Verne\\" or the icon we have depicted in \\"Back To The Future III.\\"  Despite my criticism, you do see the wonderful characters and Technicolor and three-dimensional scientists at work. They are not the flat logic boxes or computing machines, like Sherlock Holmes, or the campy \\"Professor\\" cutout character on bad TV programming.<br /><br />Vern can spin a yarn, and mix enough technical scientific detail to make it believable.  I am not familiar with Verne's scientific background, but he understands that science is merely part of the backdrop to any science fiction story.<br /><br />Leonard Nemoy's afterward in the Signature Books Edition (0451528964) is worth reading.

He can tell a tale that grips you.  I suggest reading the first chapter about DaVinci's wizened self-portrait. The whole books reads like it. Admittedly, he read emotions into DaVinci that we cannot verify.  This is no different that what Steven Ambose or Fawn M. Brodie have done with their biographies.  It helps the presentation of the material, even if fudges the facts a bit.  People do have emotional lives, and we would react similarly in similar situations.<br /><br />Another of Bramly's strengths is that he puts DaVinci's life in the context of Renaissance Italy. The Boot was very different than today, made up of the independent city-states. It was the milieu that Machiavelli wrote about in \\"The Prince.\\"  It was among these warring princes, and DaVinci's patronage by the Medic family that helped underwrite his famous works.  DaVinci's life is almost a political thriller and he moves from city-state to city-state and mingling with the great men.<br /><br />Other reviews have commented on this books scanty biography material, and the many diversion into politics and so forth.  This is because we have so few detail's about DaVinci's day-to-day life.  We do not have the usual memories, diaries, and documents that we would have for a contemporar5y person.  All we have are the notebooks, the biography made a few years after DaVinci's death, and the masterworks themselves.  To his credit, Bramly works around this paucity of material in such a way that you do not notice it.<br /><br />This book has B&W images from his astounding notebooks, and several pages of color inserts.  There is only one flaw-the Mona Lisa is one of the images in  B&W.  This is more than a shame, and I hope it can be corrected in future editions.<br /><br />Bramly devotes a hefty section dealing with DaVinci's homosexuality.  He also includes some rather graphic images from his notebooks, and a rudely funny homage to the male member.  Parents who home school their children may want to use another biography of DaVinci, since this material is college level.<br /><br />I recommend this book.

This book is quite a change from \\"The Hero With A Thousand Faces.\\"  It is conversational, flowing, and not as stiff and academic as Campbell's masterwork.  In a word, it is vibrant. As Moyers and Campbell debate, you fell his energy and passion for myth, and more import, the relevance of these old myths in this brave, new world.<br /><br />A disclaimer:  You can be a Christian and enjoy these myths.  C. S. Lewis observed, \\"If you are a Christian you do not have to believe that all other religions are simply wrong all through.\\"  (Mere Christianity, Bk. 2, ch. 1).  Moreover, anyone familiar with Lewis's background in \\"Surprised By Joy,\\" and \\"Pilgrim's Regress\\" knows that  these myths were essential in getting him to Christianity.  Or you may want to read Aesop's fables and then reread the Narnia books. You will be rather surprised by the similarities.  Or read \\"Till We Have Faces,\\" and the legend of Eros and Psyche.<br /><br />I'm not sure if this book is a good introduction or a good coda to \\"Hero.\\"  It is definitely a distillation in common English about the stores that we all know and love.<br /><br />They cover the full arc of the Hero Cycle, devoting a chapter to each segment. I found the chapter on love to be fascinating, how we shifted from eros (sexual love) and agape (charity, or Platonic Love), to amor, which is romantic love, in particular.  I was amazed that both in Greece and in India, the god of love is depicted as an archer, and being in love is like being shot.  How true<br /><br />Another insight was that the person who shot you with love is the only person who can heal you. This may be a key insight to psychology, and therefore a benefit in therapy.  If you feel infected with love, you have to deal with the person who first infected you.  You can ever be healed, except by reconciling yourself with that person.<br /><br />Campbell's main weakness is that he assumes that we are all have a working knowledge with the Greek and Roman myths. This is not true, and I suggest getting \\"Bullfinch's Mythology\\" (ISBN: 0375751475) to fill in the gaps.  It would also be helpful to have a copy of the Bible, too (ISBN: 0192835254).<br /><br />I do not believe it a sin to enjoy art, nor myths for that matter.

It includes the front matter of the Title Page, the Introduction, Testimonies of Three and Eight Witnesses, plus the Prophet's Testimony from the Pearl of Great Price, and the Brief Explanation About The Book Of Mormon. So if you have a recent edition of the BOM, a triple, or a quad, you already have the information.  The only difference is that there are no footnotes.<br /><br />This edition has several advantages over the Standard Edition (ISBN: 0967686555), which, by the way, can be gotten for free at [...]  With the footnotes gone, the book is far more readable. You do not have the little superscripts and the blocks of numbers at the bottom.  Although it is still in double-columns, it is far easier on the eye, and therefore the mind.  The chapter and verse numbers are there, but the absent footnotes make a difference.<br /><br />Since we have one standard edition, I find at times that my eye gets into grooves and habits. For example, as I hit the end of a column, my eye glosses over text.  I miss words, ideas and concepts this way. By having another text, it compensates for being so visially oriented. I get the approved text, but with a variation of page placement.<br /><br />For readability, I always suggest the reprint of the 1830 First Edition (ISBN: 083090025X).  Here, the text has only chapter division (which are longer than in the Standard Edition), and had no verse divisions.  Within the chapters, the text divided into single-column paragraphs, as in a conventional book.  It is easier to read, but there is no way to stud from this text.  Furthermore, the text was not revises and correct. Although this is not a problem-most of the alleged 4,000 changes are mere punctuation and prose-style-it is always best to stick with the most current revelation.<br /><br />The book also has two more subtle features.

If he is virgin intellectual territory for you, then I suggest getting this book,  \\"Abolition of Man,\\" \\"The Screwtape Letters,\\" and \\"The Lion Witch and The Wardrobe\\" as your first taste of Lewis.<br /><br />It has a nice balance of the all the standard and the obscure works of C. S. Lewis.  It is arraigned into ten sections:<br /><br />I. The Nature Of Man.<br /><br />II. The Moral World.<br /><br />III. The Bible.<br /><br />IV. The Trinity.<br /><br />V. Sin.<br /><br />VI. The Christian Commitment.<br /><br />VII. Hell And Heaven.<br /><br />VIII. Love And Sex.<br /><br />IX. Nature.<br /><br />X. The Post-Christian World<br /><br />To his credit, Kilby closely follows Lewis's own patterns of thought, and does not intrude his own opinion or try to slant Lewis's words to his own opinion.<br /><br />Of the selection process, he said:<br /><br />\\"It is obvious that no two people endeavouring to select the best from a man's works will always choose identical passages, and the richer the content of those works the less likelihood of total agreement.  . Concerning the making of anthologies Lewis himself once remarked, `No man ever agrees with another man's choice, and to disagree is one of the pleasures of using an anthology.'  Nothing more can be said than that here you have my own choices based on thirty-odd years of reading and rereading Lewis.\\"<br /><br />Lewis has one of those rare minds that has depth and breath, who can be succinct and deep, like church bell peal.  His wiring is dense, and forces you to think.	2004-11-11

As a Lewisophile, I keep kicking myself not getting it sooner.<br /><br />It is not a mere quote book, but more of an encyclopedia. It not only surpasses \\"A Mind Awake,\\" which is the perfect introduction into Lewis's thought, but also \\"The Joyful Christian,\\" and \\"The Visionary Christian,\\" and even the daily devotional \\"The Business of Heaven.\\"<br /><br />I appreciated when quotes from the pre-conversion Lewis were highlights as being \\"pre Christian.\\" Conversion is such a radical change of mind that things Lewis said before and after this experience should be kept in context.<br /><br />Furthermore, the book has the quite cited with book title, chapter and paragraph, which makes allowances for the various editions and binding of books.  This nice touch makes the Quote Book useful for whatever state and edition your Lewis Corpus.<br /><br />The only drawback is that this book is not a representation of what Lewis thought was important, but what Mssrs. Martindale and Root extract from the expansive Lewis corpus.  For example, Lewis believed in a for of Theosis or Deification of mortals, as articulated by Athenasius in \\"On the Incarnation\\": God became man so that man might be god.<br /><br />However, the book has a section on \\"Human Destiny,\\" but only one reference to this idea. The other quote is in \\"Glory.\\"  This is odd, because the whole doctrine of the Trinity, as Lewis explains in  \\"Mere Christianity,\\" is for men to be come sin some sense gods.<br /><br />As they present Human Destiny, Mssrs. Martindale and Root have quotes that reflect a more traditional view of heaven that is more palatable to Protestantism.  This \\"fudges\\" some of Lewis's thought.  Maybe the compilers disagreed, or did not understand what Lewis was saying on this  matter, but it does raise a caution.<br /><br />Overall, this book is useful for understand every facet of Lewis: Scholar, Convert, Philosopher, Soldier, Brother Husband, Literary Critic, Science Fiction and Fantasy writer, and Human Being.hilosopher, Soldier, Brother Husband, Literary Critic, Science Fiction and Fantasy writer, and Human Being.  <br />	2004-11-09

This book is less of a biography, and more of a moral character sketch of a man. It highlights events  that formed Ronald Reagan's moral soul.  From early childhood, to his last days before Alzheimer's, Reagan seems to have an instinctive  ability to find \\"True North\\" in any situation.<br /><br />I think his religious life is the key to the Reagan Mystery. He had a devotion to God, but kept it private. Yet it was this private relationship with God that made all the difference in what he did. In fact, he seems to be somewhat like an old testament prophet: subtle like Elisha, meek as Amos but as apocalyptic as Isaiah.<br /><br />As a fan of Jung, I found that Regan's recurring dream about being in the large white house to be an eye-popper.  That indicates that something deeper was brooding or nesting on Reagan' soul. All I can do is repeat the prophet Joel's prophecy:<br /><br />\\"And it shall come to pass afterward, that I will pour out my spirit upon all flesh; and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, your old men shall dream dreams, your young men shall see visions: And also upon the servants and upon the handmaids in those days will I pour out my spirit.\\" (Joel 2:28 - 29)<br /><br />Noonan pulls no punches. She is very candid about the Iran-Contra Affair, but also puts it in the overall context of  the man's moral sense.  Like Peter Kreeft said about Aquinas and his incorrect notions about animals not being saved, I think that Reagan made this mistake so we would not worship him as infallible (c. f. C. S. Lewis For The Third Millennium, 97).<br /><br />This book edifies. I am a much better person for having read it. I not only know Reagan better, but I know Reagan.	2004-11-07

You actually feel like you are in a South Pacific ocean, or standing in front of the moon pool. This book grabs you and suck you into the setting.  You have the feeling of gloom and wonder as you enter the Moon Pool for yourself.<br /><br />However, Merritt's gift for setting is also the books main drawback.  His prose gets wordy and adjective-heavy to the point of being absolutely unreadable. I kept rung back to Strunk and White: \\"Omit needless words,\\" \\"Be clear,\\" \\"Write with nouns and verbs, not with adjectives and adverbs. The adjective hasn't been built that can pull a weak or inaccurate noun out of a tight place,\\" and \\"Avoid the use of qualifiers.\\"<br /><br />I cant tell you how many times I read \\"coruscations,\\" a word that refers to metallic sparkles and glitters. It is also the noun form of \\"Coruscant,\\" of George Lucas fame.<br /><br />It is an obscure word, but it blunts the prose's effectiveness and story-flow if you have to stop reading and get a dictionary to figure out what's going on.<br /><br />Once again, Strunk and White:<br /><br />\\"Avoid fancy words.  Avoid the elaborate, the pretentious, the coy, and the cute. Do not be tempted by a twenty-dollar word when there is a ten-center handy, ready and able. Anglo-Saxon is a livelier tongue than Latin, so use Anglo Saxon words.\\"<br /><br />Amen!<br /><br />*<br /><br />Aside from being thoroughly unreadable, this novel fascinates me.  The setting is supernal, and I felt something move in the dept of my soul as I read it. To be sure, it is pure pulp, but pulp is just a corruption of true myth. It seemed to be a return to the underwater cave of Grendel's mother in \\"Beowulf.\\"<br /><br />Pits strike fear in the core of our being. That is why Luca uses them so much in his films for the death of villain.  This same archetype works in this novel.

It is a great measure of the human soul that we have these books. The spur us on to better ideals.  Sadly, we have abandoned these, replacing them with the ugly dystopian literature, and are worse of.<br /><br />\\"Herland\\" is unique in that it is feminist utopianism.  It is so off-beast that I was excited to read it.  All of the classical cannon of Utopian Lit is all male: Plato, Moore, Bellamy, and so forth.  I was curious about what insights Gilman would have.<br /><br />Sadly, I felt left down.<br /><br />First of all,  having so many expectation for a book, and then being let down forced me to look deeper at what was going on. I had to reexamine my assumptions and expectations.<br /><br />I realized that so much Utopian Lit is the same: people getting together, decided to stop being fools (in the Biblical sense of the word), and  actually doing what then should be doing.  Part of templette involves uniform clothing, large mess halls, centralized planning, and the un-Biblical open marriages.<br /><br />Gilman covers all of theses, except the open marriages, which I will later cover.  In fact, there was nothing really new in this book.  This is not to discredit it, but to to convey the epiphany I had while reading it.  The utopias all have common elements, with minor modifications.<br /><br />The problem with Gilman's book is in the virgin births to perpetuate her Amazon society.  This dues ex machina fatally shifts the story form Utopian Lit to mere fantasy.  All Utopian Lit must, of necessity, be atheistic. Otherwise, it becomes religious social philosophy.<br /><br />There are some other problems, some of which come from outdated science.  For example, genetically, all the women would be identical, and the environmental conditioning would not change them.  Gilman has them with different features (p. 76, 78), a genetic impossibility.<br /><br />Another problem is the centralized planning without omniscience and omnipotence.  \\"The best laid plans of mice and men . . .\\" We cannot control nature, predict earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, or predict hurricanes.  Herland has none of these. It is a peach of an Eden, but detached from the real world.<br /><br />Centralized planning never works.  We have limited knowledge.  And even if we know something, we have limited capacity to change things. We have Murphy's Law, entropy, and  Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle.  Couple all of these with the Butterfly Effect of our ignorance and impotence, and it is a wonder that anything gets done at all.<br /><br />I so not want to get into Praeto's 80-20 Law, except to mention that all utopianists, except the American Founders, completely ignore this principle, Gilman not excluded.<br /><br /> Most confusing is the birth control alluded to in Chapter 6 (p. 60).  If pregnancies are virgin, are they spontaneous, and if so, how does one control them?  This all comes back to the fact that this book is essentially fantasy, and not utopian.<br /><br />Sometimes Gilman gets downright ridiculous, as in mentioning that babies do not cry (p, 88). I understand the miracle eugenics and \\"negative eugenics\\" (p. 59), but this is ridiculous. Crying is not an annoyance, but serves several purposes, and is the root of communication.<br /><br />The religion is a disappointment.  It is just Social Gospel, but no power. It has virgin births, but no Virgin Mary.<br /><br />Another problem is the nature of evil.  Gilman notes that \\"They had  no theory of the opposition of good and evil\\" (p. 87). That smacks of Nietzscheism, and is fundamentally at variance not only with the Laws of Logic, but also common-day experience.<br /><br />By virtue of creating a Herland, she is setting women in opposition to men.  That is , she believes that society of Amazons is good, and mixing it with men is evil.<br /><br />Aristotle said,<br /><br />\\"There are some, however, as we have said, who both state themselves that the same thing can be and not be, and say that it is possible to hold this view.

For if anyone thinks that a man is not a trireme, he is clearly not a trireme; and so he also is a trireme if the contradictory statement is true.

It follows the Platonic method of dialogue and discussion rather than a strict lecturing.<br /><br />The books strength is it's focus on lies.  All of philosophy focuses on the \\"is\\" principle (The Law Of Identity). Therefore, these lies we tell ourselves as the mainspring of all the corruption in the business and organizational realm.  This book should be read in tandem with M. Scott Peck's \\"People Of The Lie.\\"  Peck's chapters on \\"Toward A Psychology Of Evil,\\" and \\"The Encounter With Evil In Everyday Life\\" are complimentary to The Arbinger Institute's philosophy.<br /><br />This book presents an easy and workable flowchart on how to analyze what we are doing .  This introspection can be revealing-a bit too revealing at times.  However, it is by giving ourselves the Third Degree that we can make progress.  What did Socrates say?  The unexamined life is not worth living. (Apology, 38a)<br /><br />Three cautions and a comment.<br /><br />First is that objectively there are people who are sluffs.  TI is not all reducible to our attitude, which would be a type of Solipsistic Fideism. (i.e. whatever you believe becomes reality).<br /><br />Second, and more importantly, is the problem of human free-will. Therefore no amount of positive thinking can change other people who are sluffs.  You have your free-will to try and change them, and they have their free-will to resist you.  Nothing we can do can change this-or change them. Couple this with Praeto's 80%-20% principle (20% of the people cause 80% of the problems), and you see how dismal the situation is.  However, even in a crash-and0-burn situation, you can go out with a flash like Socrates.<br /><br />Third-and this problem is common to all self-help books-if you are smart enough to buy this book, you probably don't need it. This is not a paradox, but an instance of \\"self-authorization.\\"  People who are smart and sensitive enough to ask question, or to sincerely want to change themselves are halfway towards the solution.<br /><br />The comment:  One of the reviewers mentioned this as Mormon propaganda. This is false on two accounts. First, The  Church Of Jesus Christ Of Latter-day Saints ([...]) does not produce these books, nor does it endorses such books.  There is no process of \\"imprimi posti,\\" \\"nihil obstat\\" and \\"imprimature\\" that the Roman Catholic Church has.  Any member of the Church of Jesus Christ is free to do what he or she wishes to do, and in fact, they are encourage to do so to help perfect the world.  It is a moral obligation. But these private endeavors are never considered official.<br /><br />Second, this attempt to discredit this book by being \\"Mormon\\" commits the logical error of \\"Genetic Fallacy\\": they are damning the origins of the idea rather than taking the idea on its own merits.  Dr. Karl Popper denounced this \\"psychologism,\\" and said that how an idea comes about is of no importance to the truthfulness of the theory (The Logic Of Scientific Inquiry, 7-9)<br /><br />So take the book on its own merits and live the principles taught: by its fruits shall ye know.s the solution.

I am, however, critiquing what he is doing.  His object is to teach logic, but what he really does is propagandize.  His anti-religious devil is in the details of the subtext and examples.<br /><br />CASE 1: He first quotes Noam Chomsky, who suggests that logic is merely hard-wired into our brain (p. 6).  This view of logic, of course, is self-contradictory, and involves the Fallacy of Stolen Concept.  If we are evolutionarily determined to believe logic, they why should we trust it? Why should we trust anything that is the end result of random chance?<br /><br />This position also implies determinisms, which would make the premises themselves determined, and therefore meaningless.  The only way we could come to that conclusion is by having a process that was not determined by evolution, but separate and apart of the process.<br /><br />Logic, in reality, is a description of reality, and must be tied to facts.  If it were anything else, it would be meaningless<br /><br />By the way, Priest and Chomsky also ignore the Anthropic Principle: the universe seems to be made to produce ham life (See Hawking, A Brief History of Time, 128-131). Logic, then would be part of this human-friendly phenomenon, and therefore exist prior to any evolutionary conditioning.<br /><br />CASE 2: Priest uses a faulty description of the Cosmological Argument in teaching about quantifies (p. 22)  By his own admission, it is card-stacking: \\"[Thomas Aquinas's] version is much more sophisticated than the argument of Chapter 3, and does not suffer from the problem pointed out there\\" (p. 109).  A professor with his stature and resources could have assigned his research assistants to fine a better example, rather than one that betrays an anti-religious bias.<br /><br />CASE 3: Priest also uses Anselm's Ontological Argument (p. 26).  He fails to note that this is just one argument for God, and that it was disputed by Thomas Aquinas (See. Kreeft, Summa of The Summa, 54). Once again, he uses a faulty argument to smear religion.<br /><br />CASE 4: He mentions Russell's Paradox (P. 34), but misses the broader point. If any system comes up with a paradox, or an absurdity, then the system is faulty.  This paradox  shows that the system of symbolic logic has a hole in it that needs to be resolved.<br /><br />CASE 5:  Priest says \\"Truth, then, comes by degrees.\\" (p. 73). He is confusing truth with facts and data.  Facts and data change from time to time, and day to day, but truth is eternal and constant.  If truth changes, then it is absurd.<br /><br />CASE 6: He discusses \\"The Best Possible Worlds,\\" and uses this to disprove the Argument From Design.<br /><br />He says, \\"Similarly with god [sic].  Conceivably there are many different way the cosmos could have been.  And intuitively, relatively few of those are  significantly ordered: order is something  special.  That, after all, is what gives the Argument From  Design its bite.  But there are relatively few possible cosmoses in which there is an orderer, so a priori, it is much more likely that there is no creator than there is.\\" (p. 90)<br /><br />Priest is blowing smoke.  He divorces the symbolic logic from the obvious fact that we have only one universe.  Any discussion about an hypothetical other cosmos is just a flight of fancy. This is formally called the Fallacy of Hypostatization: a hypothetical is taken for a reality.  In other words, Priest's point only makes sense if you abandon common sense.<br /><br />CASE 7: The Coin Toss In Hell example is his most obvious anti-religious dig (p. 99-101)  He makes the error of Discarded Differentia: he ignores the essential difference between heaven and hell. True if all you focus on is the probably of the coin toss, but you ignore the nature of hell (which comes from our own choices and character) and the nature of heaven (also dependant upon our choices and character), the argument is sound.<br /><br />This book is gross propaganda. As I read it, I felt like C. S. Lewis reading The Green Book mentioned in \\"The Abolition Of Man.\\"  To paraphrase him, anyone reading Priest  will learn about logic precisely nothing.  He is not teaching logic: teaching logic is easy, and what he is actually doing, namely propagandizing in the subtext, is much easier.  And the nocive reader will be worse off.nd the nature of heaven (also dependant upon our choices and character), the argument is sound. <br /> <br />This book is gross propaganda.

The print \\"dead tree\\" version is merely excerpts of the larger CD-ROM included in the book.

It includes scores of accounts of the transfiguration of Brigham Young.<br />This book scholarly, and is all primary sources, so it is not a quick read. However, anyone who hungers and thirsts after the words of Joseph Smith will want to buy it.<br />My only criticism is that there needs to be a better search engine.

As a compilation of essays between 1940-1945, you would think that it would be dated.  Yet, Lewis characteristically merges the timely with the timeless, which makes this tome a book for all seasons.<br />Each chapter is an isolated essay, but all revolve around the themes established in \\"Abolition of Man.\\"  These include the elimination of absolute values, the effects of literature on character education, and so forth.<br />Intermixed with these heavy and pressing topics, however, are two essays, \\"Hedonics\\" and \\"Talking About Bicycles.\\"  There are about mere pleasures and the simple delights of existence.  You can taste and feel his sense of life and his sense of delightful please in common day things.  Lewis is no curmudgeon, but something else-a mixture of rugged Elijah and tender Elisha.<br />Lewis, as a literati, amateur historian, and an ex-pagan, has a good eye for decadence.  Indeed, his was a warning voice that SHOULD have been headed. We are so far downstream that it would take several C. S. Lewises to effect a turnabout.  This may be impossible, but at least we can start with ourselves.<br />This is not the best book for Lewis neophytes.  Start with the anthology \\"A Mind Awake,\\" and stick with the \\"Five Classics,\\" and \\"Abolition of Man.\\"  Then work your way through \\"Weight Of Glory\\" and \\"God In The Dock.\\"	2004-05-02

This  book was a \\"quickie\\" due to President Hunter's sudden call to the presidency. And with his death a mere nine months later, it seemed like a still-born presidency.

You feel his warm, and inviting voice, and his persistent call to holiness.<br />As an author and teacher, I find that I am constantly going back to President Hunter's words and ideas.

This book is a wealth of sayings, observations, quips and comments that have not been preserved elsewhere.<br />If the picture on page 165 doesn't make you want to buy this book, then nothing will.<br />The only suggestion that I could make is that it would have been have to have a CD-ROM with the book text and images, plus \\"The Collected Works of Bruce R. McConkie.\\"  Ideally, this collection would include the text to all of his books (Mormon Doctrine, 2ne. ed. Rev., Doctrinal New Testament Commentary, Messiah Series, New Witness For the Articles of Faith, Sermons and Writings of Bruce R. McConkie), plus the text of the first edition of Mormon Doctrine, and the transcripts to all the conference addresses, BYU Symposia, Firesides and Devotionals, plus Regional Conferences and so forth.<br />There is already e-text formats for most of these books, and, at least for scholarships sake, we could include the e-text of the first edition of Mormon Doctrine.  Compiling a CD-Rom would be fairly easy, and it would be invaluable asset to this biography. We get the man AND his message in one gulp.<br />And if we can't have an e-text version of \\"The Collected Works of Bruce R.

Your other choices are either the two-volume complete works of Aristotle (ISBN: 069101650X and 0691016518),  choppy and ragged selections of the overall books, or buying the individual books.  This books facilitates study of Aristotle's comprehensive and coherent philosophy.<br />This edition has Organon, Physics, On The Heavens, On generation And Corruption, On The Soul, Short Physical Treaties, the Three Animals Treaties, Metaphysics, Ethics, Politics, Rhetoric, and Poetics.  You have all of the standards that a student would need, plus the lesser-known works.  Therefore, this book has achieved the Aristotelian \\"mean.\\"  It is in perfect balance.<br />The selection is superb, but the translation is moderate.  Being done in the 1940's, it sounds tinny.  The \\"old school\\" translation is full of Latinisms, archaisms, and is stuffy.  All this means that it is unclear, which is deadly to a translation.<br />The Philosophy of Aristotle (ISBN: 0451528875), on the other hand, is a lively and vibrant.  And above all, a clear translation.<br />I recommend getting the hardcover edition. The paper is sturdy, and not the newsprint like tin the soft cover.  Furthermore, it is a high-quality binding, and even comes in a protecting box.  This book is made to last, to endure, and to be used.	2004-03-30

It had the selections of  Kant's writings that I needed, and all under one volume.  I congratulate the editors for including references to the original works in the margins. This makes their edition useful as a stepping stone for studying the larger books.<br />As to the translation, it was readable, which is the best that can be expected from Kant.  The Prussian philosopher is notorious fro his run on sentence, subordinate and sub-subordinate clauses, and abstruseness.  He would give Strunk and White a heart-attack.  With this caveat, I found the translation a readable as humanly possible.<br />*<br />Since this review is about the book, rather than the content of Kant's philosophy, I will not extensively comment on it.  With his \\"Critique of Pure Reason,\\" Kant asserts that our mind affects our perceptions.  In other words, reason is in doubt. This statement is self-contradictory, and therefore invalid. If we doubt our minds, then we must doubt the conclusion that we doubt our minds, since our mind reached this conclusion.<br />Kant is the father of modern skepticism, and the godfather of relativism.  As demonstrated, relativism is an incoherent, and therefore unlivable philosophy.  Thank you, Immanuel!<br />Secondly, his \\"categorical imperative\\" is ineffective.  He appeals to duty, but duty is not an irreducible primary.  The duty is always in relation to either self, to others, or to God.  Secondly, duty is merely a means, but it is not an end in itself.  What is the \\"telos\\" of duty?  No explanation.	2004-03-28

Socrates' strength in not in the assertion, but in the cross-examination of ideas.  Kreeft-Socrates, like Søren  Kierkegaard, does not come out with direct assertions, but you are bale to read between the lines and find out what they believe.<br />The device of using Socrates talking to two college students is great. Sadly, universities are not longer places of learning, but more of a regimented indoctrination corps.  And intellectual corpses is what they produce.<br />This book should be read BEFORE someone goes to college, as a form of intellectual inoculation.  The prepared mind is he conquering mind.  In fact, I would suggest that high school freshmen should be required to read this book.<br />The only problem I have is in chapter 11, the discussion of capitalism and Marxism.  Kreeft misunderstands Adam Smith's whole philosophy.  He is not describing Adam Smith's philosophy, but a general \\"conventional wisdom\\" understanding of capitalism.<br />In fact, the very word \\"capitalism\\" betrays Kreeft's hidden assumption. The essence of Adam Smith's theory is not capital, but freedom.  By virtue of its size, Russia/USSR has far more capital than the United Sates, but is far poorer. The only difference is the freedom.  That is why there was a brain-drain in 1989.<br />On page 142, Kreeft mentions that freedom of thought is not confined to capitalism and that freedom of thought is not the defining factor of capitalism. This is dead wrong.  You have the economy, but who makes the products and transactions that actually move the economy? A free human mind.<br />He also says that you can have freedom of thought without capitalism, and capitalism without freed of thought.  This is also dead wrong.  As he presents it in the book, it is a \\"free-floating abstraction\\" since he never cites any historical data.  In other words, he is not dealing with historic objective reality.<br />Free markets must have free minds.  Modern prosperity-cultural, politcal, scientific, religious, and economic prosperity-stems from the Renaissance, which was the era the mind was freed.<br />To supplement your reading in this chapter, I suggest Frederic Bastiat's \\"The Law,\\" Hayeck's \\"Road to Serfdom,\\" Rand's, \\"Philosophy-Who needs it?\\" and \\"Capitalism: the Unknown Idea,\\" and Hugh Nibley's \\"Approaching Zion.\\"<br />I would also suggest reading Adam Smith himself: \\"Wealth of Nations\\" and his often-overlooked \\"Theory of Moral Sentiments.\\" Remember, before being an economist, Smith was a moralist.<br />With this one exception, recommend this book for high school students before going to college.  It is an easy read, easy to understand, and rather mind expanding.<br />I think the last chapter on relativism is a crown jewel.  Kreeft covers the issue thoroughly, and in a friendly manner.  He also included a scratch outline of the discussion.  This outline should be memorized by everyone BEFORE they get higher education.<br />Note: I find it ironic that Kreeft points out that morality is seen by the eye of  the mind, which sounds suspiciously similar to Adam Smith's \\"man within the breast\\" from his \\"Theory of Moral Sentiments.\\"  Aha!

It has sections from all of his major works, so it is useful for survey classes, or personal study.  Of fundamental import is Metaphysics, which is the meta-basis for his thought.  Also included are selections from his more popular Ethics and Politics, and lesser known Poetics.<br />What drew me to this book was the translation.  Most translations are really crude transliterations. Yes, it is important to be as faithful to the text as humanly possible.  But the \\"ivory tower academeese\\" sucks the life out of vibrant philosophies.<br />Creed and Wardmen avoid this problem entirely. This text was readable, and therefore enjoyable.  It reminds me of the smooth prose of J. B Phillips or Edgar J. Goodspeed.  It was like talking to a good friends, rather than a Latinized statue.<br />For a more comprehensive selection, I would recommend \\"Basic Works of Aristotle\\" (ISBN: 0375757996), or getting the books individually.<br />I love the cover!	2004-03-25

It does a wonderful job of exploring the pre-Muad'Dib Duniverse that Herbert only hinted at in the first two books. I think the best scene that illustrates this is Emperor Elrood  consulting with the two mentat lawyers.<br />I loved the characterization, and, to be honest, I find that Leto I to be a far more interesting character than his son Paul was.  Leto's confidence, sense of duty, compassion, all resonated with me.  He is as interesting as Miles Tegg, one of the few male characters that has a soul and a superabundance of guts.<br />The plots and sub-plots worked.  You get a feel mor the intricate future milieu that in some ways exceed that of Tolkien's world.  You get the feel that everyone and everything has an agenda.  And Brian Herbert's writing style is better than his fathers.  His syntax and voice are easier on the eye.  Reading this book was like floating on a stream.<br />As to the discontinuities, I saw them.  It seems like Herbert and Anderson were recasting the book in the light of the 1984 Lynch movie.  Since Frank Herbert was involved with this movie, I accept these revision as being canonical.  Plus it makes \\"the movie in your mind\\" as you read more vibrant.	2004-01-25

This book is a great revelation of the specific principles that underlie her marital and ethical philosophy.  Contrary to common belief, Dr. Lara works from fixed principles. Her show and philosophy is not a series of \\"hissy fits\\" or \\"power trips.\\"  She is articulating very ancient, and even eternal laws of conduct and behavior.  By compliance to these law, we can improve our lives.<br />In essence, Dr. Laura is doing something that few authority do.  She reveals her sources and is open about her bias. I got a four-year Bachelors degree, and in those five years, only once did a professor mention a bias.<br />This book is not a missionary tract.  Rather, it is more of a deposition and testament of what she believes. In the preface, she freely mentions that she struggled with the issues contained in the ten commandments.  This is why it is co-written with a rabbi.  Sometimes I got the feel that I was reading a rabbinical debate-it's there in the subtext. You know the old saying about two Jews and three opinions. I love the sub-text of discussion and debate.<br />I found the book easy to read, agree with some of her conclusions, and was in now way offended by the religious tone. And I enjoyed the Jewish insights, especially how Jews, Catholics, and Protestants divide the commandments differently. Jews see the first commandment as \\"I am the Lord thy God,\\" where as Catholics and Protestants skip this preface, and go directly to \\"Thou shalt have no gods before me.\\" This preface is a pause and consideration of the nature, grandeur and existence of God.  This pause and preface lays the foundation for the rest of the commandments.<br />I recommend this book to people of all branches of Judeo-Christianity.  This nexus of faiths are all tied to Abraham and Moses.  There is something of these laws in all religions, and I value Dr. Laura's and Rabbi Vogel's insights on the matter.There is something of these laws in all religions, and I value Dr. Laura's and Rabbi Vogel's insights on the matter.	2004-01-25

What we believe and what he hold dear is what makes up the sum and substance of our art.  Furthermore, art affirms our philosophy,.  In this way, she bridges the gap between truth and beauty.  We hold the beautiful to be beautiful because it is true.<br />Sadly, Any Rand is one of the few artists that has a coherent philosophy. Others include J. R. R. Tolkien (Catholic), C. S. Lewis (Anglican), Steven Spielberg (Jewish), and Orson Scott Card (Mormonism).  The reason why I find myself gravitating to these artists is that they believe something, and it is their passion that shows through.<br />But as Rand points out, it is not just passion, but a specific passion about humanity and human potential.  Having slogged my way through \\"Atlas Shrugged,\\" I believe that Rand is correct.  It is a character's ethics and values that drive them.  We want to believe, and these characters that achieve-be it Frodo, Peter and Lucy, or Ender Wiggam--affirm our belief.<br />This book is great text on aesthetic theory, but it should be read after reading \\"Philosophy--Who Needs it?  Rand does her usual lucid, concise, and very intelligible job of explaining her philosophy, and connecting it to art.  And, of course, Nick Gaetanos' robust cover art is worth the price of the book.	2004-01-17

The characters are fascinating, the situation is absurd, and craft is supernal.  It is a great classic, and a wonderful way to get into Jules Vern's other writings.<br />I think the key to the book is not just the absurd bet that Fogg makes, but that Verne adds to the deadline tension by having this idiot Inspector Fix trail Fogg on his voyage around the world.  Fogg not only has to combat the perils of global travel in the 1890's, but also Fix as he sabotages Fogg's journey.  That is genius.<br />This book is all plot: you are whooshed along for the ride and it never eases up. The Chapters are short, adding to the sense of speed.

That is Mr. Eager's best book, and it sets the tone for every other book he wrote.  You get a feel for the type of characters he has in his stories, and the theme of magic having rules, which is absolutely critical in this book.<br />This books' charm is that Mr. Eager is so vague about the children's; wishes being magic or not that you are left wondering.  This is not as overt as his other books, and it is this subtlety that energizes me.<br />We all know that magic has rules-read G. K. Chesterton's essay \\"The Ethics of Elf-Land\\"-but this book takes that idea to the next level.  The magic is not magic at all, but just our godlike powers of doing good and helping other people.<br />This book is a great way to get your children to do right.  Start out with \\"Half Magic,' and teach you children that magic, along with everything else, has rules.  Then introduce them to this series of books, which teaches that magic is just us doing the right thing.  This will save you many lectures and fights sine the morality is coated in a fairy tale.<br />A great alternative to Harry Potter.	2003-11-11

The disciplines of study, of reading and reflecting, of dialoguing in dept and praying with belief sustain the wonder.  In short, wonder is captured in one word-worship.\\" (164)<br />Dr. Zacharias is well known for his sophisticated and often hardball apologetics.  It believe him to be one of the quickest minds alive today.  He is able to balance quick and precise reasoning and express it in a very calm, friendly, and often-times humorous way that gets the point home.  He would be a great asset to anyone, but I am glad that he found his niche in Christian Apologetics.<br /> In this book, Dr. Z nurtures his more affirming side.  This book does not have all the clever logic-chopping that his other books has. It feels more like a \\"Chicken  Soup for Socrates' Soul.\\"<br />He makes very good points about the need for wonder.  Most people you see nowadays are stumbling and slouching their way in a fog. It is always a rare person that has that spark of light in their eyes.  These people are a charm to be around.<br />The book discusses several virtues we need to have to energize wonder: gratitude, truth, love and hope.  These arc coupled with study, thought, prayer (which is a form of thinking).  Ultimately, wonder equates with worship.<br />This book is a great way to introduce someone to Dr. Z thinking and speaking style.  I cannot say enough good things about this man.<br />However, I think Dr. Z makes only one mistake in the book.  He talks about one of the destroyers of wonder being \\"anything that takes away the legitimate mystery of life and living.\\" (p. 46)  He then speaks about there being bounds to human knowledge.  True, he is talking about mortals \\"pretend[ing] to be God and play[ing] God,\\" (p. 47) but the illustration of knowing all of the \\"hind the scenes\\" of a play chaffs me.<br />I have always believed that the glory of God is intelligence.  Understanding and knowledge have always helped love God and other people better.  And as to plays, I am one of those that loves the Disc 2 of the DVDs, with the \\"behind the scenes\\" snippets.  These, coupled with the audio commentary, make the movie more enjoyable.  And knowledge makes life more enjoyable. Ignorance is not bliss, and it is not wonderful.  It is impossible for man to worship God in ignorance, to be saved in ignorance, and it is also impossible to be happy in ignorance.of God is intelligence.

Really, my heart goes one direction, and my mind is going in two directions.  So if this review is awkward, it is because three are three people writing it.<br />I feel that this is a great book explaining a principle or concept that is very dear and absolutely revolutionary to Mr. Eyre and myself.  We are members of the same Christian denomination, and one of the reasons why our denomination exists is to tell people about our life before life.<br />Mr. Eyre explains this idea without going into the High Restoration Theology of The Prophet Joseph Smith behind the idea.  He presents this High Theology in terms of personal intuition, with a  very calm, conversational, reassuring, affirmative and an encouraging voice.  It is the tone that makes this book so sweet.  By reading this book, you would never guess there is so much weight behind the concept.<br />So that is my heart.  This book feels good.  Now my mind goes in two directions.<br />First, he introduces this idea on terms that an person who has never heard or considered the idea would readily accept.  This is the best starting place for anyone who is unfamiliar with an idea.  He uses literary and philosophical sources to illustrate and support this idea, and he follows up by discussing there implications of the idea.<br />By discussing the implications of the idea of life before life, he should get the Congressional Medal of Honor.  A lot of people have good ideas, but a genius knows the implications of the ideas.  This \\"implication analysis\\" is probably the best argument for reading the book.<br />However, the other half of my mind has concerns.  The first concern has to do with \\"stolen concept.\\"  He teaches an idea, but he does not cite the source of the idea.  As I said, there is a lot of High Theology behind what he says, and yet he does not cite these sources.  In essence, he presents a counter-factual rational for believing what he believes.<br />Mr. Eyre does not believe in life before life because he read a poem by Wordsworth, or liked a passage from Plato.  He believes what he believes because of the revelations of a modern-day Prophet.<br />The benefit of this approach is that people can look at the idea with our having  to worry about being hustled into a religion, or pressured to join a denomination.  The idea can be studied without any emotional baggage.<br />The downside is that we are being very secretive about revelation and prophets, and indeed, the entire Restoration itself.  If I can be so bold, and yet say this with an Everest of respect, this smacks of being ashamed of the gospel of Christ.<br />I do not want o condemn Mr. Eyre.  In a certain way, I understand why he chose the approach. There are advantages in presenting the doctrine this way: building on common beliefs, no pressure to join the denomination, and so forth.  The problem I foresee is that people will start teaching a doctrine independent of the prophetic source.  Taught this way, the doctrine loses its force and imperative. There is a difference between a good idea and a revealed doctrine.  It is just that if we constantly and consistently teach doctrine this way, we are hiding the talent of the Restoration.<br />So having spoke my  peace, I believe that this book would be a good introduction for non-members, or new members of the church.  It raises many good issues, provides a Revealed alternative to the reincarnation craze, and is just good reading in and of itself.<br />By the way, Mr. Eyre did not mention two other sources of life before life.  In the Platonic dialogue \\"Meno,\\" Socrates proves life before life by having a slave boy solve geometric proofs. The slave-boy could not have learned all of this geometry in this life time, so he had to have learn it in a previous life.<br />The other source comes from \\"War and Peace.\\"  During a Christmas Party, one girl says that if you keep remembering back before you were born, when you were an angel.

His characters are as vibrant as a Van Gogh, his plot is tense, and he has quite a gift for quips and comebacks.  All of this combines for a great piece of literature, regardless of the topic or story.<br />This book explores the darker side of humanity, along the lines of Faust, Dr. Jekyll, and Lord of the Flies.  We all feel this dread and anxiety deep within our soul; Wilde does not hold a mirror, but a picture for us to look upon and marvel.  You get the chills up and own your spine as you watch Lord Henry seduce Dorian Grey.<br />I think the high point of the story was in Chapter XI when Dorian sets a mirror next to the foul picture and goes back and forth looking at his baby-face and then the incubus in the painting.  What is crucial is that Dorian is so detached: he sees himself as the smooth-faced god, but in reality, he is the demon in the picture.  But his detachment is what is so crucial.  He knows what his soul looks like, but he doesn't care!<br />At times this books seems like a play, which has Wilde's native element.  But the prose has such a smooth flow that you do not notice.  I found myself constantly underlining Wilde's aphorism.  He has a gift for one-liners, and his book is quite a charming read.	2003-09-23

B. White.  So that means I have undergone a great voyage of discovery!<br />White's strength is his characterization.  Aged Arthur still sees adolescent at times, and Merlyn is the wise man who still has his share of foibles.  The Nazi's were army ants, and even Archimedes and the Badger had warm personalities.  As I read, the \\"charming: keeps coming to mind.<br />The problem with \\"The Book of Merlyn\\" is that White stopped retelling Mallory's Le Mort d'Arthur, and began running down his own political deer-trail.<br />Don't get me wrong: I think White's insights into humanity and into specific human is keen.  There was an edge to the way he dealt with Lancelot, and his Merlyn is far more affectionate the C. S. Lewis's in \\"That Hideous Strength.\\"  But the problem with the book is that he got \\"off message,\\" and got off of his element.<br />This book is but about Arthur or Merlyn, or the Round Table, but is really White's response to the events around World War II.  He is , in effect, doing to Camelot what Nietzsche did to Zoroastrianism: use a good medium to expresses a bad idea.<br />To the point, White analyzes humanity in relation to other animals.  Merlyn, Arthur and the councils of animals are unable to decide what and how to solve the human problem.  They begin the discussion by try to name human.  Is he Homo Ferox (Ferocious Man), Homo Stultus (Inefficient Man), or is he Homo Impoliticus (Impolitic Man)?<br />On the surface, the discussion between Arthur and the council of animals is great parody on the level of Gulliver.  The Nazi as ants is brilliant, especially the part about \\"done\\" and \\"not done.\\"  On second glance, there are some problems.  We can look to the animals for examples, but in reality, we are reading humanity into the animals.  Then, we takes these mythical non-existent animals, and use them to criticize humans.<br />Sure, we can look to geese as being very sociable, but geese do not have agency and intelligence.  That is, the do not know better but behave differently.  It is all instinct.  Their behavior is neither good nor bad, since that cannot choose to be bad.  Congratulating the geese on behaving nicely would be like congratulating the sun for rising.<br />This logical error is called \\"Anthropomorphic Fallacy\\" where we read human behavior into inanimate or animal objects.  Poet (and White is one par excellence) use this to great aesthetic affect.  Btu it is the blackest of all rational errors.  White's fantasy gets in the way of the point he is trying to make.<br />Secondly, White merely focuses on externals. The solution to peace is to remove all borders.  In 1776, the United States had open borders between the states, but that did not prevent the civil war.  In both the Civil War and World War II, the key issue was not borders.  A closed border meant nothing to Hitler, since he would just driver a tank across it.  But the key issue was freedom and how to use it.  Hitler's nationalism was just a catalyst for more sinister ends.<br />White did hit the truth in Chapter 1. The issue is one of Original Sin or Original Virtue.  Merlyn points out \\"To disbelieve in original sin, does not mean that you must believe in original virtue.  It only means that you must not believe that people are utterly wicked.\\"<br />He knew the question or peace was one of human nature; he just forgot it in writing the rest of the book.them to criticize humans.<br />Sure, we can look to geese as being very sociable, but geese do not have agency and intelligence.

I remember reading an anthologized fragment of this book in high school.  I thought it was hilarious, forgot about it, and was glad to rediscover it by way of the second X-Men film.<br />This book is about adolescence.  Because of the themes of maturity and growing up, I exhort (yes, EXHORT!) all parent to get their teen-age children to read this book..  This book is literary \\"Pet Sounds,\\" and covers all the emotions that we feel when we grow up.  I was taken back decades, and personal involvement the key to good literature.<br />Before reading this book, keep in mind that it is shaped by two forces.  First, the Arthurian legends, primarily Mallory and Tennyson. Second, World War II.  Keep both in mind, or the book makes no sense.  White makes the point that the Round Table is the solution to World War II.<br />This book is in four parts.  The first one is \\"Sword in the Stone,\\" the basis for the Disney movie of the same name.  It is Arthur's tutelage under Merlyn.  White captures Arthur's adolescence perfectly-it is a stunning work that made me feel thirteen again.  Merlyn is the mentor, but he has his loveable foibles that make his charming. It also makes him very  believable and antithetic.  And the relationship between Kay and Wart is male Cinderella.<br />The second part is \\"The Queen of Air and Darkness.\\"  Once again, White shows his genius for showing family relationships.  We add to Wart and Kay's relationship Gawain and families  rather complex relationships.  It reminded me of my own family.  The different personalities makes the story so spicy.  It is all personalities and relationships.<br />I think this story gets more poignant that the first since we both Gawain and Arthur cross into manhood.  Gawain with the killing of the unicorn, and with Arthur the battle and the decision to found the Round Table to end war.<br />The third story is \\"The Ill-made Knight,\\" which focuses on Lancelot coming to the Round Table and his affair with Genevieve.  This book is about idealism and love, which is a form of idealism.  Lancelot is in love with both Arthur and Guinevere, and this hero worship almost becomes \\"Hero Idolatry\\"<br />What bedazzled me was the lies that Lancelot believed about his affair with Guinevere.  Chapter 5 sums up all of the Knight's lies:<br />\\"But please don't talk to me about the queen. I can't help it if we are fond of each other, and there is nothing wrong in being fond of people, is there?  It is not as if the Queen and I were villains. When you begin lecturing me about her, you are making it seem as if there was something between us. It is as if you thought ill of me, or did not believe in my honor.  Please do not mention the subject again.\\"<br />These lies and Lancelot's capacity to lie and speak white lies is amazing.  It is genius on White's part to come up with these half-truths.  And a half truth is a total lie<br />This book is rather long, and I would have divided it a Chapter 13, which is where Greymere changes from medieval to renaissance culture.  Arthur succeeds with Camelot, for \\"one brief shining moment.\\"  He then turns the Table's energy to finding the Holy Grail.  This is the point: Arthur does not solve the violence problem, but merely sublimates it.<br />The last book is \\"Candle in the Wind.\\"  It is the rise of  Mordred, and the fall of the Round Table.  The book is about adolescence, but White is able to convey an old, tired, and very lonely Arthur who's past sins come to haunt him.  In fact, the entire downfall of Camelot is due to the chastity sin.<br />Mordred is as good a liar as Lancelot.  His problem is that Lancelot has some degree of virtue-maybe naivet&eacute;-but Mordred is a chainsaw.  He lies to scheme, and then gets back at his derelict father.  Another timely message.<br />The book stops suddenly, without a real resolution.  Camelot dims, and it seems like Arthur's work has been for naught.  But remember that the book is really finished in \\"The Book Of Merlyn.\\"<br />White's Round Table was the United Nations, but in a sense, we are all still adolescents.s Round Table was the United Nations, but in a sense, we are all still adolescents.	2003-09-04

That is why Lewis dedicated \\"The Screwtape Letters\\" to  Tolkien.<br />My favorite essay was \\"on Writing,\\" where Lewis explains his philosophy behind the Narnia books, but also gives hints about his creative process.  He begins with pictures in his head (which means his is visually oriented), and then gets the pictures in his head to connect with each other.  Then he types what he sees.  Fascinating!<br />This book is for the hard-core Lewis fan, or the English Major or aspiring writer.  For novices, stick with the \\"Usual\\" Lewis books, such as \\"Screwtape,\\" \\"Abolition of Man,\\" \\"Mere Christianity,\\" and so forth.

Thea von Harbou's book is the indispensable companion to Fritz Lang's immortal film.  As most people know, Lang's film was butchered by German and American editors-we have lost about 25% of the film.  Essential scenes and many of the subplots were deleted to make it fit within a small time frame.  Reality Check:  The shorter the film, the more times they can show it, and the more money they collect. Consequently, with the best of restorations, we are seeing a film with as many gaps as a hockey player's smile.<br />This book, which was serially published before the film's release, fills in the gaps.  You get a better sense of the story that Lang and von Harbou are trying the tell.  The book allows you to get inside the heads of Freder and co. in a way that the film does not allow.  You get a stronger feel for the dystopic milieu that Freder fixes.<br />This story is essentially mythic, so devotees of Joseph Campbell, George Lucas, and James N. Frey will devour the book and the film.  You see the messianic and redemptive elements that makes this story so enduring.  This story is one of my favorites, and rates with anything C. S. Lewis, J.

As you can see from the \\"Look Inside\\" function, and by the index, it covers the whole nine yards.  It focuses specifically on the orbiter, and covers all aspects of shuttle missions from launch to landing.<br />As an aspiring sci-fi writer, I found this book to be the perfect reference.  It has raw statistics, such as orbiter length, cargo bay volume, and it even goes over the meals and menus and how they are prepared.  It also goes in to the history of the orbiters, and the names of the ever shrinking shuttle fleet.<br />Several sections deal with the now-defunct Spacelab modules.  The Spacelab was the shuttle equivalent of a camper shell that sat in the cargo bay.  It turned the shuttle into a mini space-station, and had several interchangeable modules.  One section was a pressurized module with a battery of experiments, which was connected to the shuttle cockpit.  Other sections included a multi-use pallet, and an experimental pallet.  This Spacelab was retired in 1997, and has been replaced by the Spacehab modules, which was on the Columbia when it broke-up over Texas.<br />This book is written in the normal \\"Basic English\\" of instruction manuals, and can be understood by elementary school children.  It also has many diagrams and pictures, which save many thousands of words of descriptions.<br />By the way, this book does explain how the space lavatory.  In case you are curious, it is a normal commode with vacuum suction, although I have heard stories that it can smell at times.<br />This book's one weakness is that it is a bit impersonal.  If you want to know about the emotions and reactions to life in spaces, another book may be better, such as Tom Wolfe's \\"The Right Stuff,\\" of Homer Hickam's \\"Back to the Moon.\\".  As you read this book, you must supply your own excitement and emotion to this book, since it is an operator's manual.  It reads a bit like an encyclopedia, or dictionary, and not a novel.<br />After reading and referencing this book, I felt as if I had been on board!novel.<br />After reading and referencing this book, I felt as if I had been on board!	2003-02-05

The two previous books seem to be mere back-story for this one book.  I was caught up in the emotion and pace of the book.  Every chapter is its own novelette.  In fact, sometimes I believe that the story can be too quick and too terse at times.<br />Smith has quite an active mind.  It reminds me of Zeus giving birth to a full-grown Athena from his head.  This series has an overwhelming ambient.  Not only are the props and gizmos there, but also the social and political connections.  There are layers and depths to the story he tell, it is as layered as Tolkien's \\"Lord of the Rings\\" and Herbert's \\"Dune\\" series.  You feel that you are in a real world, and not just look at a painted background.<br />I confess that these stories are dated in some ways.  There is the quaint 1930's and 1940's slang that you see in old Bogart and Hope/Crosby movies.  There is a bit of naivet&eacute; about human nature, even thought there are drug dealers and pirates.  Some of the science is dated, such as ether theory and cultural progressions.  Despite these things, the story holds its own, and compares to anything new in print.<br />Many people complain that the characters are flat.  I see their point.  Kimball Kinnison's marriage isn't on the rocks, nor is he about to be kicked off the force, and he certainly is a loony-but-crafty vigilante like Batman.  But he is an admirable character, and is someone I admire, despite being fictitious.  Then again, Jean Valjean is also fictitious, but what a piece of fiction!<br />Admittedly, the Lensmen seem to be flat because they are so morally virtuous.  But you wouldn't describe their lives as boring.  Kinnison can barely catch his breath as he zips across the galaxy catch the drug runners and the pirates.  Kirk, Petard, and Skywalker eat his inertialess dust.  Kinnison isn't flat, but he is ideal.  These books are modern-day morality plays, and serve the same function as their medieval counterparts; they instruct and set a pattern for our behavior in the so-called \\"Real World.\\"<br />This Old School Sci-Fi is essential reading.  I wish I had read it earlier.  It is essential Sci-Fi reading, along with Wells, Verne, Asimov, Herbert, and Bradbury<br />By the way, I have been keeping track of the names, and am surprised at how far Smith's intellectual seed has been sewn.

It is a mixture of \\"The Gospel of Work,\\" the idea of \\"Progess,\\" Buddhist stocism, and Christian precept.  Its main topic is human empowerment by mental disciple.  I cannot argue with this intent and belivef.  What would I bde like if I just focused my self a lttle more?<br />I got this book on the reccomendation of several leaders wiothin my Christian denomination.  I see why.  He has Christ's (and Socrates's) encouraging voice that asserts truth witou being overbearing or hardening into a prideful dogma.  I beluive that is why he endures: he speaks the truth in a peaceful voice.<br />Many people belive he preaches Christianity, but Christinaity's central doctrine is the Atonement of Christ, and this doctrine is absolutely absent for Allen's writings.  None theless, this is a good book.  I have become a better person by reading and applying his doctrine.  Besides, my computer is not specifically Christian, and Amazon.com is not a Christian company, but I would not trade these two things away for anything, even though they are not specifically Christian.<br />I eagerly await reading vol 2 in this series!	2003-01-26

This is my first foray into Frey's fiction-helps---no regrets whatsoever!  I have seen his other books on how to write \\"Durn Good\\" fiction, but have never felt the inclination to read them.  This book's angle, however, had me by the neck in nanoseconds.<br />I believe that writing is a sacred act-\\"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was God\\"-and that between the scribbling and the agonizing, we are somehow approaching God.  Frey affirms my belief and provides a popularization of Joseph Campbell's \\"Hero With A Thousand Faces\\" monomyth templet.  He asserts that this monomyth is THE KEY to writing good fiction.<br />It may be argued that formulas are bad, and limit creativity, or that they are, well, too formulaic. Handled badly, formulas can be stale and predictable; however, if they are handled right, the provide a rhythm and cadence to the story.  I look at formulas as being frames to a story, and we can add, delete, or modify the formulas as needed.<br />Admittedly, the creativity arises in the execution, not the outline.  Keep in mind, all 154 of Shakespeare's sonnets have the same framework, meter, rhyme scheme, and all use the same 26 letters.  However, no two sonnets are alike.  Yes, some are better than others, but that is just normal for fiction.  I believe THE KEY is in have the correct framework, and then building upon it.  Frey provides this framework, or skeleton for our fiction.<br />Having read Campbell's \\"Hero With A Thousand Faces,\\" and found this book true to Campbell's intent.  In fact, it would be a great introduction and pre-requisite to reading the classic of literiture.  Remember that George Lucas used \\"Hero With A Thousand Faces\\" as the basis for his Star Wars stories, and that is endorsement enough!  In my case, several knotty problems in my fiction have been solved because of this book.  Your only way out of a dead end is either up or down.  Frey lifts us up!	2003-01-24

I confess that I have never read anything so energetic and face paced; in fact, every chapter is a novelette in its own right. Why haven't these books been made into films or miniseries?!<br />This book is essentially the story of the call of Virgil Samms as the First Lensman. With his lens, he is able to crack a futuristic drug ring. Many subplots involve the expansion of the Lensmen corps, the election of one of the Lensmen as North American President, and the formation of the Galactic Patrol.<br />So is this book Sci-Fi? Is it crime drama, a la \\"Dragnet?\\" Is it politics? I don't know: it crosses many genera and is as thick as \\"Dune\\" or \\"Lord of the Rings.\\" I am impressed with the leap from the thin stories of Verne and Wells, to this tick and meaty tale of the future.<br />Admittedly there are some anachronisms, such as references to the Ether Theory, and vacuum tubes on the space ships. One character even references a \\"Slip-stick,\\" which is a slide rule. But this aid to the charm and quaintness, and do not detract from a great story.<br />The originally thin characters round out and actually become people in this novel. I think this series finally comes alive in this book, and breaks out of the pulp mold. I see seeds of Smith's world cropping up in Star Trek, Star Wars, Forbidden Planet, Babylon Five, and other pre-WWII sci-fi novels. Truly, it was a golden age.<br />I am absolutely hooked on this series and eagerly await reading the remaining books.	2003-01-22

Yes, it is pure \\"pulp fiction\\" in the non-Quentin Terantino sense of the word, but it was a powerful page turner.  Every page was super-charged, and every chapter left you wanting more!<br />E. E. \\"Doc\\" Smith is one of the giants of SF, and one of it's greatest popularizers.  He doesn't have the finesse that Asimov of Heinlein.  He doesn't have the aura of humor of Niven.  Doc's strength is his raw energy.  This book is like watching Yoda's fight with Count Dooku at double-time.  He overwhelms at times..<br />Another one of Doc's strength is his mixture of science and gadgets.  You are immediate placed in a world of sub-ether communicators, atomic weapons, tractor beams, spacer ships, space armor, and all the other props associated with old school SF.  I now know where Roddenberry and Lucas got many of their terms and gadgets.<br />This tale is layered, and you can actually smell the intrigue and forces control other forces and nothing is what it seems.  \\"Wheels within wheels\\" and \\"plots within plots within plots.\\"  At times it can be over complex.<br />Sometimes the action runs too fast, and I find myself panting for the characters.

This book isn't quite a parallel novel to \\"80 Days;\\" it is more like a double take of that book.  Farmer extends his \\"World Newton Family\\" in Verne's classic, and makes Fogg's mission an intergalactic battle against Captain Nemo, who Farmer believes is Professor James Moriarty of the Sherlock stories.<br />Farmer, one of the greatest student of \\"Pop Pulp\\" culture manages to combine the heroes of the popular literary world in to a coherent world system.  In Farmer's world, Tarzan is related to Sherlock Holmes, and Doc Savage is the grandson of Jack London's Wolf Larsen.  In a certain sense, we all do this on our own.  For example, what would have happened in \\"A Tale of Two Cities\\" if the Scarlet Pimpernel had saved Sydney Carton from the guillotine?  Farmer's \\"World Newton Family\\" functions along these lines.  He has even made two rough genealogical charts showing who is related to whom.<br />As Ir ead this book, two things struck me.  First, the approach of this book reminds me of Crispin H. Glover's attempts to read new stories into old classics.  Secondly, Farmer clarifies many of the odd things about \\"80 days.\\"  How does Fogg know everything about all of the odd lands.  How does he know all the schedules of every boat and train everywhere in the world.  Why would a man who lived such a controlled and regimented life on a sudden take a trip around the world just to win a bet?<br />I recommend that you read Verne's book first, and Farmer's second.  I didn't do this, and am still regretting it.  I kept on reading Farmer's book into Verne's story, and couldn't enjoy Verne's spell.	2003-01-14

It isn't a radio drama like \\"The Shadow\\" or \\"The Green Hornet,\\" but it is more like listening to Jack Benny or \\"A Prairie Home Companion.\\"  It is a casual and laid-back-and frequently funny-dialogue between Spock and Q.<br />However, at times, it transcends the TV characters and becomes a verbal spar between Nemoy and De Lancie.  Nemoy as Spock is calm, collected and gentle, with that grave and steady voice that is fun to listen to.  Despite being unemotional, Nemoy-Spock has that dry and nuanced with that reminds of Socrates.  De Lancie plays Q as that fun, bouncy, and spoiled-brat that reminds us of a cocky teenager with a drivers license and a full tank of gas.<br />I'm not sure if the plot is weak, or if it just low-key.  But it does sway before these two talented actors playing their memorable characters.  I wonder if there is the germ of a TV special here?

To ignore this book would be like biographizing Lincoln, and ignoring the Gettysburg Address.<br />It is a collection of the 173 Nauvoo discourses of Joseph Smith, covering the years 1839-1844.  It is an interesting mixture, since the Prophet wore so many hats.  We normally see him as Prophet, Seer and Revelator, but he was also Mayor, General, and Presidential Candidate and was a Husband, Father and Lover.  This book opens up Joseph Smith and we hear him as the early saints heard him.<br />For example, on 180-181, James Burgess includes some of the Prophet's rhetorical \\"Oh no!\\" and \\"Oh yes!\\" flourishes.  Sometimes we sand down Joseph Smith, thinking that he has some rough redneck edges.  But I imagine that he would be quite a personable speaker.  Judging from these notes, I am quite convinced of it.<br />I confess that we do have the \\"distance problem.\\"  We have a few autograph manuscripts, so we must work through the scribes.  Then again, this is no different than the Socrates-Plato perplexity, and we still recognize Socrates as a great thinker nonetheless.<br />The gem of this book is the six contemporary accounts of the King Follet Discourse.  You see how the early historians amalgamated the text into a seamless whole, and can see that there was no deception involved with the synthesis of the talks into one whole.<br />The book is divided among the five years, 1839-1844, with the spectacular notes placed at the end of each year-section.  This novelty allows of easy access to the information, and makes the book thoroughly user-friendly.<br />This is one of my favorite books.  I continually refer to it to double-check the talks in the official History of the Church, and Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith.  Admittedly, it is a technical book, and not for casual reading, but for the serious hard-core scholar, it is a library essential.<br />This book is not an end all to the Joseph Smith question, but it brings us closer to a solution.ut it brings us closer to a solution.	2002-11-30

This story of human redemption is deservedly a classic.  People can change, and anyone can improve, and that is the message of the season.<br />Dickens' genius is not only his vivid description, but also his thought compression.  It is only 68 pages long, so it can be read in one setting.  I try to do thins, since the story has greater force if it is swallowed whole, without any commercial breaks.

His main point is that by the Atonement, we all become free, but because of the atonement, we have an obligation to serve other people in chaity.<br />I like this edition.  The translation is actually a translation, and Mr. Grimm block the text into paragraphs for easier reading.  Moreover, he provides the scriptural references that Luther merely alludes to.  Thus, the book becomes lecture notes for our review and pondering.<br />The cover illustration is eye-catching.  It shows Luther taking his stand before some potentate.  It reflects the energy that you feel in the words, the drive that empowered a man to shake all of Europe.  It shows the energy that drove this man to liberty.	2002-11-30

This story outlasts time.  It is not merely an adventure story about a boy freeing a dragon, but it a message about the lengths we should go to help other people-even if they are dragons in their heart.  It is about the adventure of hove as we free people from prison, what ever their chains may be.<br />The illustrations are done in foggy charcoal and perfectly compliment the story.  The book was first published in the 1940's, and the illustrations are a snapshot of that simpler era.  In a sense, they are a type of Norman Rockwell Fantasy.<br />I got this book for my nephews, and when my sister-in-law finished the last book, my nephew said, \\"Let's read them again.\\"	2002-11-29

Mary Anne, and old steam shovel is about to be replaced by the modern diesel s and electric shovels.  To prove her worth, they engage in a John Henry-esque race to dig the basement of the new Sky Scraper.  She manages to dig the basement, but she is stuck!  Instead of junking her, they convert her boiler into the heater for the new building.<br />What a message!  There is no obsolescence, but just new challenges that can be overcome.  Mike and Mary Anne prove their worth in sticking it out, and adapting to new circumstances.  Children are empowered to see problems as opportunities, and are taught that even the obsolete have a place in society.<br />I have a friend who was sexually abused as a child, and the message of this book helps me help him.  Everyone has a nitch, if we can just find it and capitalize on our talents.  This message can empower anyone.	2002-11-29

Put the opera in CD form, and attach a nice picture book for children, and you have a perfect classic.  I hope more books like this are on the way.  This is a perfect introduction to a masterwork of opera.<br />I confess that \\"The Magic Flute\\" is my favorite opera.  It retells the ancient Freemason legends in opera and dramatic form, so you know that the story is rather primeval and sacred.  I am glad, therefore, to see that someone has transposed the story for children.  The book and the legend hold up well against \\"The Odyssey,\\" Shakespeare, and Harry Potter, and the story has an incredible soundtrack to boot.<br />After all, we are really focused on the mysterious music and the incredible love story of Tamino and Pamina, and the trials that keep these two apart.  The more I read and ponder the story, and ultimately its esoteric message, the more I love this story.<br />The CD is perfect and without hiss or crackle.  The book is geared for a 3-7 year old, and doesn't do the story justice.  However, it is a great introduction to this opera.	2002-11-27

I cannot perfect perfection.<br />First, he hits the genius of Christianity, and take's Paul's chapter on Charity, 1 Corinthians 13 as the backbone text.  This is an impressive \\"love poem\\" which really explains why Christianity is so novel.  If you don't believe me, read pre-Christian literature, such as Socrates, Homer, or The Epic of Gilgamesh.  Pre-Christian society ignored human dignity and worth, and people were just functions of the state, or the whim of the king.<br />Secondly, Kierkegaard recognizes that love is a work, and not merely a state of heart or a chattering point.  This notion of work is anathema to \\"Pop Protestantism,\\" which was Kierkegaard's mortal enemy.  He commented that the obsession with \\"grace\\" had turned Christianity upside-down, and had caused men to try and cheat God out of his religion.  This is another way of saying that faith without works is dead.<br />Kierkegaard last insight is that God is the basis of love, which he underscores in the opening invocation.  Too many people gloss by this prefacing prayer, but that is what separates love and love with power.  God gives us power to love.<br />I found this translation quite readable.  Soren, in any version, is rather thick, almost as if he is intentionally trying to hide things.  Part of difficulty comes from the dense 19th Century verbosity that was a token of the age.  However, his greatest asset is humorous illustrations, which helps mentally fix the points forever.<br />The only criticism I have is that Kierkegaard does not connect love to the Atonement.  He does, in the introductory benediction, assert that we need to have love securely wedded to God, but he does not connect love to the Atonement and the Resurrection, the central doctrines of Christianity.<br />This is Soren at his best, so I recommend that you begin your Danish journey here, then move on to \\"Either/Or,\\" \\"Fear And Trembling,\\" and \\"Sickness Unto Death.\\"  But the key to Kierkegaard's existentialism is love.and \\"Sickness Unto Death.\\"  But the key to Kierkegaard's existentialism is love.	2002-11-27

This is a great \\"Thumbnail\\" and \\"introduction\\"  to the hefty five-volume opus that many people love, but few have read.<br />There are only two deficiencies with this volume.  It does not have any commentary that other Thomistic books have, such as \\"A Summa of the Summa.\\"  Secondly, it omits the rather fascinating interplay of ideas that characterizes all of Thomas' works.  Aquinas was agile at confronting and assimilating opposing ideas.

It surprised me that this man was a genius in many languages, but since I only speak English, Portuguese, Spanish, and French, I demurred.<br />I finally settled on this edition since it does the job that an English student or aficionado would want.  It contains the complete English sonnets, his English plays, and the supernal-issimo twins \\"Paradise Lost,\\" and \\"Paradise Regained.\\"  In addition to the polyglot works, this book omits his prose works.  But that is for another time and another day!<br />The \\"helps\\" are great.  Every line in Epic Paradise plays is numbered, which prevents any miscounting errors.  Moreover, it has many helpful footnotes, which highlight many of Milton's word plays and puns.  In this dimension, Milton is one of the funniest classicists in the universe.<br />I enjoy Milton.

Remeber his talks on our strengths being our downfall; on adversity; on being saved; the article on homosexuality; his adress on wheightier matters; on distinguishing between sins and mistakes; and so forth? This book is along those lines, discussing the doctrine associated with names.<br />Based on a talk originally given in the April 1985 General Conference, Elder Oaks has expanded his ideas into a book form. He discusses the signifigance of names as they relate to God, to church service, and to our eternal identities. Many missionaries make a big deal about having the name of the Savior and their names togeather on a black name tag. This book explains that the conomiality and carrying the name of Christ goes even deeper than a temporary acessory that will be cast aside after two years. Elder Oaks points out that the name of Christ should not (just) be on our chest, but in our hearts, and engrained in our soul.<br />The book is slim, and is very readable. Elder Oaks relies on the scriptures as his main source of information, which is laudable. Moreover, there is a special treat for those that read his introduction ot the book!<br />It is refreshing to read a book on the finer points of the Gospel, to help perfect myself in my ministry.	2002-10-24

M. Scott Peck is a powerful writer.  I find his analysis sound, his tone warm and embracing, and his insight perceptive.  I only wish we could clone him-not only his body, but his mind and soul as well.  He has found a great way to articulate some aspects of Christianity that would embarrass most pastors and so called Christians.<br />His book focuses on love, which he defines as \\"The will to extend one's self for the purpose of nurturing one' own or another's spiritual growth.\\" (81)<br />He hits the mark several times in this almost perfect definition.  The first bull's-eye is the part about extending ourselves.  We need to be concerned with other people, which is so obvious that it needs no comment.  This idea is so old, that it must become new in our ears to have any affect (or effect) in our lives.<br />He prefaces it with the world \\"will,\\" which I take to mean a general disposition of the heart and the mind, as opposed to a mechanical habit of the hands and mouth.  Love is really state of mind, which produces actions, and is not an action in and of itself.  It is not a thought, but something that drives out thoughts, which drive our words and our deeds.<br />The nurturing aspect of love is another key element, since we are to build other people up.  Our lives are like whetstone: we are to sharpen other people.<br />What makes this definition unusual is that he includes one small qualifier: the aspect of nurturing ourselves.  This seems heresy to some love-fanatics, but I believe it is an important aspect of our spiritual health.  Selfishness is a sin, but the converse of selfishness-whatever you call it-is also a sin.<br />The people he is describing I believe, are the \\"angry activists\\" types that smear our TV screens.  You know the charitable organizations who get mad at you if you want to see their books and IRS records, or the people who get mad at you if you reject their friendly advice.  \\"I just want to help you!\\" he said with a sneer that revealed his fangs.  Those types of people.<br />Another type of person is the quiet sobbing martyr.  \\"I really don't care-do what ever makes you feel good.  I just go to the corner and mope and pout for the next six months.\\"<br />His book follows through his this great insight, not only into human behavior, but human attitudes.  Admittedly, love cannot merely be defined; it must be experienced.  However, Peck does a pretty good job.<br />Pecks ultimate aim is to make gods out of us:<br />\\"For no matter how much we may like to pussyfoot around it, all of us who postulate a loving God and really think about it eventually come to a single terrifying idea: God wants us to become Himself (or Herself or Itself).  We are growing toward godhood.  God is the goal of evolution.  It is God who is the source of the evolutionary force and God who is the destination.  That is what we mean when we say that He is the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end.\\"  (269-270)<br />This makes simple sense: God is the absolute perfection in love, and as we perfect our love, we are becoming more and more like Him.  And the same thing applies in other areas of our life, such as faith, endurance, and even punctuality.<br />Actually, this is really a Judeo-Christian doctrine that got lost somewhere along the line.  We are created in God's image (Genesis 1:26-27), and we are made a little lower than God. (Psalm 8:5)  The King James Bible mistranslates the Hebrew word \\"Eloheim,\\" which is usually translated as \\"God,\\" as angels.  Later in the Psalms, it says that we are Gods, children of the most High (Ps. 82:6), a verse that Jesus quoted to the Pharisees (John 10:34-35).  St. Athanasiaus succinctly said, \\"He became man, so that we might be God.\\" (On the Incarnation, 54: 3)  And so forth.<br />This book is not so much about love as it is about \\"toughlove.\\"  You are encouraged, hugged, caressed.  But you are also grabbed by the scruff of your neck and given a boot to the butt to get you going.  Somehow thisbook works out, and Peck gets his message across.book works out, and Peck gets his message across.	2002-10-05

The duty of a Prophet is to draw a straight line to show how crooked we are.  The duty of a satirist is to show how crooked we are by drawing an even more crooked line.  Mr. Percy's line is quite crooked.<br />This book is billed as \\"the last self help book.\\"  He makes his point \\"sharper than a serpents tooth\\" in that the entire book is set of multiple-choice quizzes.  But, as you suspect, the answers are stacked.<br />My personal favorite from page 75:<br />\\"Question: Why do so many teenagers, and younger people, turn to drugs?\\"<br />\\"(a) Because of peer-group pressure, failure of communication, psychological dysfunction, rebellion against parents, and decline of religious values.\\"<br />\\"(b) Because life is difficult, boring, disappointing, and unhappy, and drugs make you feel good.\\"<br />\\"(Check one)\\"<br />I found his perspective on suicide, and especially on being an \\"ex-suicide\\" to be both novel and fascinating.  He asks the question: why not consider suicide as an option?  We normally (that is, in the pre-Kevorkian world of 1983 when the book was written) exclude suicide as an option, but Percy makes the point that our depression, angst, etc. may actually have a basis in reality, and we may be justified in pulling our own plug.  \\"Consider the only adults who are not depressed: chuckleheads, California surfers, and fundamentalist Christians . . . Would you trade your depression to become any of these?\\" (p.76)<br />By the way, for the Person of Faith who is horrified at this idea of defacing the image of God in suicide, please read (in this order) the book of Lamentations, the book of Ecclesiastes, and then the book of Job.  The first two books we routinely ignore, but the last one, Job, we merely talk about and do not read.  The case for life being [insert your favorite expletive here] is made in this holy trinity of Biblical books.  But back to Percy!<br />Percy asserts that life becomes meaningful when we look at suicide as a legitimate option.  He is merely reasserting the old law of oppositions, that truth is revealed in the contrast.  The capacity of \\"not to be\\" makes Hamlet's \\"to be\\" all the more meaningful. If we commit suicide, we cause a ripple, annoy our creditors, but after that, nothing much else happens.  We just get a change of scenery.  However, if we consider suicide, then consciously elect against it, we have become empowered by our choice.  We finally begin to live.<br />Percy closes the chapter thus:<br />\\"The difference between a non-suicide and an ex-suicide leaving the house for work, at eight o'clock on an ordinary morning:\\"<br />\\"The non-suicide is a little traveling suck of care, sucking care with him from the past and being sucked toward care in the future.

It is good to be alive.  He goes to work because he doesn't have to.\\"<br />You can see that Percy is a neo-existentialist, and does Kierkegaard proud.  In fact, I think Percy has gotten back to the proto-existentialist in that he has not abandoned religion, which gave Kierkegaard's ideas such a zest.

He is powerful enough to cross the denominational bridges, and that is quite a compliment!  This book is the Angelic Doctor's last written work.  In fact, he died in the midst of writing the book, so it is incomplete, which is our loss.  A mind like his comes once in a Millennium, so we are all worse off to not have more of his writings.<br />This book was intended to be a literal \\"hand book,\\" a one -volume summation of Aquinas' rather bulky Summa Theologica.  It follows a deceptively simple format of three parts: Faith, Hope, and Charity.  At first blush, this seems to roughly correspond to II-II of the Summa.  However, Aquinas restated his arguments for God's existence, and covers in a nutshell the main points of the entire I-I and I-II of the Summa.<br />It is a rare thing to find someone who can sum up a complex idea, or a string of complex ideas and concepts, but \\"The Dumb Ox\\" characteristically pulls it off.  I wish more public speakers and politicians could develop this talent, since we get off on so many intellectual rabbit trails, and miss the great Yellow Brick Road.  He does have a point to what he says, and he does stick on topic.  Hence, his enduring power.<br />The translation is an easy read, and nothing really spectacular jumps out pro or con.  As is stated in the introduction, this translation was to be a crutch, and the true student is encouraged to go to the original Latin for any hair-splitting nuances and so forth.  The standard numeration is followed, so we can easily compare the translations.  I hate translators/publishers who play God and reinvent the wheel in these matters.<br />I feel that this book should be used in conjunction with Kreeft's \\"Summa of the Summa.\\"  They are about the same size, but each book has its strengths and weaknesses.  \\"The Shorter Summa\\" has the benefit of being Aquinas speaking for himself, and him telling you what he thinks is important, with the only disadvantage being that it is incomplete.  The \\"Summa of the Summa\\" has the benefit of Kreeft's commentary and illustrations, and is (mostly) a good summery of Thomism, but it is Kreeft's-and I say this will an infinity of charity and respect for a great man-\\"spin\\" on Aquinas.  So my advice is to split the difference and to get both books.<br />The only real objection I have is that the picture of Aquinas is rather unusual.  He looks like one of the extra-terrestrial \\"Greys\\" that Art Bell talks about.  Aquinas is a genius, and a human computer, but he isn't a Vulcan, and he never made a crop circle.  G. K. Chesterton speaks of a portrait of Aquinas with piercing eyes.  The only clue we have is the starburst design, but it would be nice for a Chesterton scholar to try and track down this portrait, and start using it.  Or at least stick with the traditional Medieval sketch that graces the covers of most of the current Aquinas Anthologies.the only disadvantage being that it is incomplete.

This is more of a testimonial than a review.  You can read about me on pages 131-133 of Dr. Peck's book.<br />I came to this book backwards: I began with reading \\"People of the Lie.\\"  Surprisingly, \\"Road Less Traveled,\\" and \\"People of the Lie\\" are the exact same book, but written from the opposite points of view.  I was not bored, however, with reading the same book twice, since each book has a different emphasis and each has different proscriptions.  It is just that the concepts are mirror images of each other.  \\"X\\" and \\"-X\\" are both \\"X,\\" with one minor exception!<br />This is a hopeful book.  It is a healthy book.  It deals with reality head on, the bad and bloody along with the good.  What usually puts me off with \\"Self-help\\" books is that they usually sell an attitude, or they are just a paper packaging of the author's temperament.  This book goes beyond this and comes to the startling conclusion that, yes, Virginia, pain does in fact hurt!<br />With that obvious fact accepted (if 9/11 didn't catch your attention, read \\"Job,\\" \\"Lamentations,\\" and \\"Ecclesiastes\\" in the Bible if you have any questions), Dr. Peck calls us to courage and work in developing the spiritual health of other people.  He says that the basis for sin is laziness and selfishness, something that the Mormon prophet Joseph F. Smith taught, and calls us to be men and women of righteousness.<br />This review does his book an injustice since I can't do justice to what he writes.  If you can feel any passion in these words, please buy and live this book.  It has not only changed my life, but it has improved my life immeasurably by bringing me in contact with my better self, and more importantly, God!	2002-09-14

This is the book that Rush Limbaugh would have written had he not been dealing with his hearing loss.  The power of this book is not so mauch that Mr. Hannity is teaching new truths-that is the province of crackpots and charlatans-but that he is explaining and elucidation upon the time honored and proved truths of life.<br />This book was rewritten after 9/11, which is an appropriate watershed.  Mr. Hannity sees the attacks as an outgrowth of liberal-leftist philosophies, and he endeavors to persuade with his typical Irish fire that our choice is either liberty or liberalism.<br />This book provides a good survey of Mr. Hannity's thought and passion on politics and the way things ought to be.  You do not need to be familiar with his cable program or his radio show to understand this book-it stands on its own.  It does, however, provide a good introduction to this multi-media giant.<br />It is clearly written, and has a very conversational tone, muck like his radio program.  It also has extensive endnotes, which are usually absent from similar books (i.e. Rush Limbaugh and Bill O'Reilly).  The index is great, which is a rare compliment because I have yet to meet an index I like.  It is written from the conservative-right point of view.	2002-09-14

This is Dr. Zacharias' second \\"Great Conversations\\" book, and it has a marked improvement over \\"the Lotus and The Cross.\\"  One of the strengths is that he is dealing with the witty Oscar Wilde, and included his scintillating quips and quotes, which makes for hilarious reading at times.<br />This book is more of a trialogue, with Rene Descartes being Jesus' \\"Second\\" in the discussion, filling the role of George MacDonald in C. S. Lewis' \\"Great Divorce.\\"  So we have the Savior discussion things, and at time we have two mere mortals speaking to us, after the manner of our language and understanding.<br />This book is livelier than &quot;The Lotus and the Cross,&quot; due to Oscar Wilde's wit and silvertongue.  Inadvertently, Dr. Zacharias underscores the limits of humor, in addition to the laws and principles under girding pleasure.  That is a novel idea to people--pleasure is not like a pie-eating contest, but more like a fine banquet, with the appetizer, main course, and dessert.<br />By the way, Paul Copan has written two books on deflating the witty slogans and bumper-sticker thoughts that gum-down Christians: \\"True For You, But Not For Me,\\" and \\"That's Just Your Interpretation.\\"<br />I love the book's format--the medium is the message!  The book is small, inviting, and has those soft photographs.  The dialogue is plain and simple, and there is no jargon or confusing philosophic doubletalk that generates more heat than light.<br />The only criticism I have is that there is not a lot of background into Wilde's very wild life.  I found Dover's Thrift Edition of \\"Dorian Grey\\" to have a nice five-paragraph biography that filled in some missing details, and provided a nice background text to be read before and after reading Dr. Zacharias' book.	2002-09-10

Instead expect straight talk and simple language about what the youth can do about improving the world.<br />I found this book to be refreshing in that it focuses on the way youth need to be, and what they can do to themselves to improve.  It doesn't advocate the type of \\"Superman\\" activism, where people go off to other lands for a certain amount of time and solve everyone else's problems.  Nor does the book rely on political-governmental solutions to the world's problems.  Instead, President Hinckley suggests nine habits, or virtues, that the youth can incorporate in their lives to help change themselves.<br />This is a quiet book.  It doesn't advocate a new government bureaucracy, or tax cut to solve the problems the youth are facing.  It suggests the simple and soft things we can do to make a difference.  Much like the three servings of leaven that filled the whole loaf.	2002-09-06

This is more of a review of the translation, as opposed to the text itself.  The Republic is a classic, and like Shakespeare, or the Mona Lisa, needs no review or comment.  This is not to say that I agree with everything Socrates-Plato says, but that this book lifts you higher, weather you agree or disagree.<br />Tom Griffith deserves an award for rendering a bouncy translation that makes the text come alive.  This translation ranks among my favorites.  Its strength is that it renders the Greek into a colloquial, conversational English, as opposed to the stiff and ossified academic dronings that make higher education such a joy!<br />He follows the pattern set by Seamus Heany (\\"Beowulf), and J. B. Phillips (\\"The New Testament in Modern English\\"), where the language illuminates the text, and engages your mind.  Too often, the translators' end product-the language-gets in the way of the ideas and joys of the text.  I was able to plow through this book in a fortnight because the language flowed so well.<br />I wish we could get more translators to get the gift of tongues, and to render these classic texts into the tongue of angels!	2002-09-05

I adore Mr. Copan's ability to not merely &quot;chop logic,&quot; but to hold up the torch of intelligence.  This book, and his previous book, &quot;True For You, But Not For Me,&quot; are geared toward defeating the pseudo-converational sloganeering that passes off for discussion and thought that will be the undoing of Generation-X.<br />Copan tackels these &quot;bumper-sticker&quot; thought-bites head on.  Try these out on someone who is a walking platitude, and you see what I mean.<br />The most objectiobns will be with the Trinity, the Incarnation, and Evolution.  He takes a more Trinitarian approach to the Trinity, which some would interperit as polytheism but as the Good Book says,  &quot;There be gods many, and lords many . . .&quot; (1 Cor. 8:5).  This is really a mystery that even Aquinas couldn't logically prove.  Wasn't it C. S. Lewis who siad that the Trinity of the Creeds was either the greatest truth or the greatest lie?<br />In regards to the incarnation, he wrestles with the tempations of Christ and His divinity, and asserts that Chriat had laid his divinity aside, as per Phillipians 2.  He runs betweeen making a monkey out of the Bible, or making a monkey out of the Savior, andf I think he steers a steady course between the two.<br />He advocates a hybrid theiostic evolution, with the days being of indeterminant length.  See the  usage of &quot;day&quot; in Genesis 2:4 versus Genesis 1:5.<br />The trick is to defend you faith, and affirm the strengths of your opponents position, without selling our your own theology in the name of reason, or some theoretical elegance.	2002-09-04

Roberts was a maverick, and that is what makes this history so interesting.  He was able to mix the good and the bad, the agony and the ecstasy of the history of Nauvoo: the City of Joseph.<br />I think that Elder Roberts was born in the right time to write such a book.  He knew many of the displaced citizens of Nauvoo, but he also knew that many of the rising generation needed to know about this great phase in the History of the Church of Jesus Christ.<br />This book has the feel of Elder Roberts' \\"History of the Church,\\" and \\"Comprehensive History of the Church.\\"  It has a strong reliance on Joseph Smith's journals and diaries, and other primary sources.  Moreover, Elder Roberts was not afraid to cite critical sources-or even anti-Mormon sources in telling his story.  He was very careful to avoid the sensational and untrue \\"faith promoting rumors\\" that fill our testimony meetings.<br />The only criticism is that there are no illustrations, which is more a fault of technology than a bad judgment call.

I am glad that the renaissance of Joseph Smith Manuscripts is still going on.  It hit a high mark when Mark Hoffman was deftly producing his forgeries, and seems to have petered out a bit.  As Jesse says in the introduction, \\"Since the first edition, a team of scholars has commenced preparing for publication the complete papers of Joseph Smith, which, it is anticipated, will fill a dozen volumes.\\" (xvi) Good!  The Church of Jesus Christ has put a lot of time and money into Islamic Classics translations, and the Dead Sea Scrolls, that it is high time they remember their founder and prophet!<br />The book itself is a gem.  It has some materials that were previously published in \\"The Papers of Joseph Smith, vol 1-2,\\" such as the 1832 account of the visitation of God the Father and the Son Jesus Christ, and his early journals.  The bulk of the book is devoted to letters and epistles Joseph Smith wrote in the process of his life and mission.<br />Some of the letters are interesting, such as his letter to Oliver Cowdery discussing his early childhood.  Others, such as his letters to Edward Hunter (my great-great-grand uncle), are rather boring and incidental to the greater work.  This book also includes several letters to his wife Emma.  I feel like a voyeur as I read these letters, but I am also very curious about this aspect of Joseph Smith's life.  We see him as a Prophet, Seer, Revelator, and Translator, but not as a husband, father, and lover.  These letters open up this aspect on to the man's life.<br />Jesse has also included photographs of the manuscripts, so if you are into eyestrain, you can compare the transcription against the original document.  This becomes important in the 1832 account of the First Vision, where Joseph Smith give his age when the events happened.  He wrote the age in a \\"between-line\\" insertion, and wrote the age in Arabic numerals.  The age has traditionally (habitually?) been transcribed as \\"16th year of my age,\\" but as the manuscript showy, the \\"y\\" from the \\"heard my cry\\" in the immediate above line crosses over the \\"16\\" in the insertion, so it is possible that the \\"16\\" may actually be a \\"15,\\" which corresponds to the other accounts of the First Vision.<br />The maps are absolutely incredible, and the mini-biographies help us keep track of who's who.  The paper is very sturdy archival paper, and the binding is reinforced, so the book should really last the ages.y, the \\"y\\" from the \\"heard my cry\\" in the immediate above line crosses over the \\"16\\" in the insertion, so it is possible that the \\"16\\" may actually be a \\"15,\\" which corresponds to the other accounts of the First Vision.<br />The maps are absolutely incredible, and the mini-biographies help us keep track of who's who.

It has very soft and relaxing pictures that match its soft and reassuring message.  Admittedly, this book has a pastoral feel to it, and isn't a deep theological work.  Some people see things work in practice, and wonder if they can work in theory.  This book is very practical.<br />It is directed to the youth of the world, primarily pre-teen and teenagers, but I believe it works for anyone of any age.  In it, President Hinckley outlines nine \\"Ways to Be.\\"  In this sense, it is a youth edition of this \\"Standing For Something,\\" which lists ten virtues for adults.<br />The nine \\"Ways to Be\\" are:<br />Be Grateful.<br />Be Smart.<br />Be Involved.<br />Be Clean.<br />Be True.<br />Be Positive.<br />Be Humble.<br />Be Still.<br />Be Prayerful.<br />Each chapter discusses why these virtues-or \\"be-attitudes\\"-are important, and how we can live these virtues.  President Hinckley's strength is that he uses homespun examples, and simple language, much like the Bishop Bienvenu in \\"Les Miserables.\\"<br />Sometimes, getting to heavy with doctrine, such as Elder Bruce R. McConkie or Thomas Aquinas taught, can put people off and be counter-effective.  However, President Hinckley keeps the language simple, clear, and very prophetic.<br />I found his chapter on \\"Be Still\\" to be intriguing. It is said that religion is the opiate of the masses, except in Utah where it is an amphetamine.  The opening ceremonies at the 2002 Winter Olympics was done by local volunteers. However, President Hinckley encourages us to seek the quieter times and places in our lives.  It reminds me of Jesus Christ seeking places of solitude during his ministry.  It sticks in my mind because it is so unusual.<br />I think the most enchanting thing about the book is that it is affirming.  There isn't any negativity, doom and gloom, or hellfire and damnation, but a clear message of what we individually do within our spheres of action and in life.	2002-08-08

I hope more people with the &quot;gift of tongues&quot; can add some honey like Seamus Heany did in his beautiful rendfering of Beowulf a few years of god.  These stories are beautiful, and we need to transpose that beauty in to English.<br />I love the format of this book.  It has the standard text of Gilgamesh, but has copies of all the alternate texts and readings, so you are getting the full whammie with the book.  George also included maps, &quot;dramatis personae,&quot; helpful chronologies, a glossary of the oddf names you read in the story, adn a publication history.  His essay on &quot;from tablet to stone&quot; is helpul in expalining all the lacunae and the gaps in the poem.<br />I love the illustrations which seve as a sweet spice to the text you are reading.

Oswald Chambers is one of this age's greatest Protestant preachers.  He has keen insight into the human condition; consequently, his is able to call all our bluffs. His is also one of the greatest Christ-centered preachers ever.  These two axes are the reason why this man, though he was an active preacher for only a decade, has such sticking power.<br />Chambers was an active preacher for only one decade.  He died of appendicitis at age in Cairo, due to complications with his appendicitis.  Providentially, his wife was a trained stenographer, and she kept copious notes of her husband's sermons and lectures.  This book preserves these great sermons for all posterity.<br />He had a very broad mind.  He has studies on the Sermon on the Mount, Ezekiel, Jeremiah, Lamentations, and other topics.  This book also has his book \\"Baffled to Fight Better,\\" his very substantive and piercing study on the book of Job, and, of course, his daily devotional \\"My Utmost For His Highest.\\"  Also included are \\"Biblical Psychology,\\" \\"Christina Disciplines,\\" and \\"The Shadow of an Agony.\\"<br />To think he did all of this in the short space of ten years.  If he had lived, we would place him on the level of A. W. Tozer, C. S. Lewis, and Billy Graham.  Even as it is, this book is not merely impressive, but absolutely mind and soul-blowing!  Oswald Chambers embarrasses everyone: he did more in ten years than most do in their entire life.<br />The book itself is textbook size, and is printed on thin scripture paper.  The font is contemporary and has an impeccable look to it, so it is easy to read.  The text is also in double columns, which for some reason always impresses me with importance, probably because the scriptures and Shakespeare are usually in double column format.  This also allows for two more margins to write notes and cross-references.<br />The CD is the perfect companion, and compensates for the rather skimpy index, and absence of illustrations.  Personally, I believe the perfect index could only be a CD ROM-instant access to everything.  In addition to containing the text of the book, it also has the e-text and pictures of \\"Abandoned to God,\\" David McCasland's biography of Chambers.  I give many brownie points and many tips of the hat to the compilers for including the King James Version of the Bible on the CD, which can only help your study of Chambers thoughts and insights into Christ.ndex could only be a CD ROM-instant access to everything.

S. Lewis's mind and G. K. Chesterton's tongue.  He is a linguistic genius with the ability to twist a phrase and compress a thought into poetry.<br />This six-volume collection has ALL of Elder Maxwell's twenty-seven books in one system-fitly framed and in a compact body.  The pages are guilt and the binding is absolutely divine.  The cover does justice to the golden words and thoughts contained on the fine pages.  The pages themselves are thick and sturdy, and should last several lifetimes of study and pondering.<br />The books contain their original pagination.  The benefit is that you can find citation from older references, and you are looking at the original plates and illustrations.  The down side is that in each volume, the page numbers may cycle several times under one cover.  I prefer the form method of original pagination, since the original pagination keeps a standard format.<br />There are two problems, one obvious, one not so obvious.  One suggestion that I would make is that the names of the titles within the covers be named on the spine, since it can be hard to find one specific volume out of twenty-seven spread across six volumes.  Happily, there is a comprehensive index in volume six, which covers the entire corpus.  Happily, they have included the \\"Neal A. Maxwell Quote Book\\" also in volume six, for quick and easy reference.<br />The other problem is what to do when Elder Maxwell produces a new book.  His cancer is in remission, so we can expect more from his prolific pen.<br />This is a great collection of books for a Maxwell fan, or one wanting to expand their scholarship or insights into the Gospel.	2002-06-10

Theses things will eventually happen due to the Generation X baby bust that is lowly working it's way up the actuary tables.<br />There is one gaping flaw with the book and that is that he never explains why living in a primarily Third World-Islamic world would be bad.  Several reasons include the concept of the Rule of Law, which dates back to the Magna Carta in 1215.  Europe also underwent a Renaissance, which never touched the Mid East, and only England underwent an Enlightenment, which is the logical and scientific outgrowth of the Renaissance.  Another historical factor was the Protestant Reformation, which shifted religious power from the various popes and priest to the people.<br />What we would be left with would be a system that had a centralized Leviathan government with no human rights, no human dignity, and none of the blessings of technology that we now enjoy.  Marxist Luddites such as the Unabomber may savor such a world, but consider what type of life we would have.  We would be throwing the world back into the Dark Ages.  Do we really want another Black Plague, with bathing ourselves once a year, weather we needed it or not?  What about the loss in dentistry and orthodontics?<br />Mr. Buchanan does have the gift for writing, and at times this book seems like a speech than an exposition.  I appreciate his copious and heavy footnotes-they kept me quite busy as I tried to double-check his research.  I look forward to response and criticism papers on this book.t the loss in dentistry and orthodontics?<br />Mr. Buchanan does have the gift for writing, and at times this book seems like a speech than an exposition.

US	50147915	R1XFVMGF0Y1USG	1891353012	374980800	The Holy Scriptures Inspired Version (Joseph Smith's Translation of the Bible - Complete Text	Books	4	18	19	N	N	New Look at the New Translation: The Raw Data.	This is the Joseph Smith Translation (aka \\"Inspired Version\\" and \\"New Translation\\") of the Bible. Granted that the Bible isn't Holy Ground, but rather battleground, it is wonderful to see what Joseph Smith has don with the Bible to improve it. He understood that doing a new translation of the Bible was a branch of his calling (HC 1:238, D&C 107:92)<br />I think that every great churchman has his own version of the Cannon. The Jews believe in the Hebrew Scriptures, the Catholics believe in the Hebrew and Greek Scriptures along with the Apocrypha. Martin Luther removed the Apocrypha, and classified the Book of James as an \\"epistle of straw, and frowned upon the Book of Revelation. Thomas Jefferson also had his Unitarian version of the Bible, with his vi3ew of the scriptures. More recently, Dr. James MacArthur came out with his rather intense version of the Bible, with many footnotes and maps.<br />What Joseph Smith did was to pray over the Bible and receive inspiration about what needed to be corrected and restored back to the Bible. The version clears up some of the contradictions and questions of the Bible, such as Cain's wife, the length of days of creation, what God was doing before the creation, and weather or not Moses actually wrote the first five books.<br />This edition differs slightly from the official Community of Christ (RLDS) version of the bible since it includes the preface to the book of Genesis that they Community of Christ places as a section in their Doctrine and Covenants. This book follows the Community of Christ versification and punctuation. There are no footnotes. \\"Songs of Solomon\\" is missing without any explanation. The Joseph Smith Translation manuscript mentions that the Song of Solomon was not inspired. The footnote to Hebrews 5:8 explaining that the parenthetic refers to Melchizedek and not Christ is also missing.<br />We do not have a perfect version of the Joseph Smith Translation, but this edition helps us come close to the goal.	2002-05-17

I think everyone is agreed that the trilogy is back on track.  As Muad'dib observed, \\"Beginnings are such delicate things.\\"  In fact, after reading this book, \\"The Phantom Menace\\" for me has become a better film and a better story.  The plot lines that were drawn in Episode I are filled in and rounded out<br />Now, about Jar Jar Binks: Don't worry-he appears in about three scenes.  He does however play a pivotal part of the story, and for one moment, the entire plot rest on something he does.  The Simpsons call Jar Jar Binks \\"Poochie,\\" but Binks gets slightly better treatment.  By the way, have you noticed that he is not in any of the trailers?<br />This is a good novelization.  I am not familiar with Salvatore, but I found his prose to be like glass.  This book returns to the high standard of screenplay adaptations set by Orson Scott Card with \\"The Abyss.\\"  It has the feel of a good story, and it is not at all like reading a screenplay.  I hope Salvatore does the novelization for the next film.  The pacing and the length of the chapters are done perfectly, and compliment the prose and the films, which is what we are all about.<br />I found many of the parallels in the story reminiscent of \\"The Empire Strikes Back,\\" the other middle film.  Note the parallels between meeting Amidala's family with Anakin's family, and the father-son relationships between Kenobi and Anakin, Jango and Boba Fett, and Panaka and Typho. Indeed, this book is almost a fugue like the \\"Back to the Futuure\\" trilogy.  There are also other parallels, but I would get pasted because they are spoilers.<br />The \\"Star Wars\\" Universe, it must be remembered, is primary a film phenomenon, with the books being a back second.  You cannot get very intricate as Tolkien or Herbert when you have only 2 ½ hours to visually and musically present a story.  This is really the biggest weakness of the \\"Star Wars\\" franchise, with the other weakness being that there are so many minds weaving the tales that there are several minor contradictions, such as Boba Fett's oringins. However, this book is a benchmark for all the \\"Star Wars\\" books, showing us that there is a strong and viable print side to the universe.e several minor contradictions, such as Boba Fett's oringins.

Even criminals believe in morality, at least as they grow older. . . . When asked, at aged thirty-two, weather they would be very angry if their son or daughter committed a criminal offence, over three-fourths of those men who had themselves been convicted of a crime (and often several crimes) answered yes.  Even the most hardened criminalsthose with at least eight convictionsagreed.  They may not be very good fathers, but they dont want their sons or daughters to be very bad children. (11)<br />This is quite an interesting book. It focuses on the moral sense, an idea whose heyday was coeval with the Scottish Enlightenment and the American Revolution.  The central thesis of the book is that there is we have a moral sense, a sense that certain things are right and that certain things are wrong.  Wilson observes that his book differs from other research in that many conducting this search have looked in the wrong places for the wrong things because they have sought for universal rules rather than universal dispositions. (225) This is not so much a quest for absolute laws, as C. S. Lewis did in Abolition of Man, and in Mere Christianity, but it is a rather psychological-heavy inductive study ob what people actually do and say.<br />The book is divided in to three sections.  After the overview chapter, Wilson covers different aspects of our Sentiments, focusing on Sympathy, Fairness, Self-Control, and Duty.  These four areas provide a grind in which our feelings of morality are properly expressed.  I found the chapter on Sympathy quite interesting, since Sympathy is the lynchpin of Adam Smiths landmark Theory of Moral Sentiments.  We in essence see ourselves projection into the life and situation of other suffering persons.  Moreover, we head the voice of the man within the breast who urges us on to good actions, which Lincoln called the better angels of our nature.<br />The second half of the book is a study of the sources of these feeling of rightness and wrongness.  The four chapters are The Social Animal, families, Gender, and the Universal Aspiration.  He makes the case for much of our sense of morality is rooted in evolutionary biology.  Darwin will always select in favor of the people who are pro family, since that is how we will survive fitly.  Moreover, we have this herd instinct which binds us together into cities, poli, and bodies politic.  In fact, the greatest realization that came to me was that we nee morals precisely because there are other people with whom we have to deal with, work with, and to ultimately love!<br />The last part is one chapter long, and it focuses on the moral sense and character.  Wilson makers the point that we cannot prove in a positivistic sense that there are moral standards or laws out there any better than we can prove Platonic forms.  However, people do act as if there are moral standards, and the idea of morality itself is evidence.<br />Mr. Wilson has a soft, quite and gentle voice and tone that could double for a relaxation tape.  I have heard him in person, and must say that it like the announcers at a golf match or an announcer on National Public Radio.  This works to his advantage, since many of his ideas are quite controversial. This book is perfect for discussion, and ponderous thought.  Now all we need is more research along these line to sharpen our picture of the moral sense.<br />I mentioned that the book is rather psychosocial heavy.  Let me amend that by saying that there is a substantial amount of psychological data, but no psychobabble.  Moreover, Mr. Wilson liberally quotes from Aristotles Nichomachian Ethics and his Politics, so we have a healthy mix of both the old and the new in this book.  It is quite refreshing to see someone bridge the ages, and bridge the gap between philosophy and practice, and theory and data.<br />The main question that vexes me is that you could not tell the difference between a people who does not have a moral sense and one who ignores his or her moral sense.  The outward behavior would be the same.  The only clue that we have is the lie detector, which measures biological reactions to lies.  We may tell lies, but our body knows that we are lying.

The Bible is a book of many diverse books.  It has two testaments containing a total of sixty-six books, written by over forty different authors over a 1,500-year span.  Compare this to the Koran which was reveled through one man Mohammed over the space of twenty years, or the Analects of Confucius, which was compiled several years after his death, and therefore without his oversight.  And I'm not even going to mention the Socrates-Plato problem.  In any case, I believe that there is truth in all religions and all religious texts, but the Bible is rather unique among religious texts since its backgrounds are so broad and diverse.  Yet, when have forty people agreed on any one thing?  And since when have forty people agreed on religion?  Yet the Bible is one long sermon, from Genesis to Revelation.<br />I love the King James language!  But for fans of Shakespeare, this goes without saying.  In fact, the King James Bible and the Bard have been the greatest influences and preserves of the English language!<br />This version has the Apocrypha, which id great for anyone one wanting to get the full scoop of the scriptures.  I know they are disputed books, but I am one never to shy from controversy.<br />So what does the Bible mean to me?  It is a token of hope.  There is no supposition, conjecture or guesswork involved with the things of God.  We have two testaments, two witnesses to God's love and His plan for us.  I read this book every day, and the more I read it, the more I love it.	2002-04-19

Two observations.  One, this is dramatized history, so you are not reading the court transcripts, which are available at your local law library.  Secondly, although I do not believe in evolution, I find the play fascinating.  Indeed, you might say that I am fascinated with the fascination around this event, as if a court could decide the truthfulness of a scientific theory!<br />This is a play about ideas, and many sub ideas.  Are we free to teach what we believe?  Should the state underwrite every theory?  Should we engage in civil disobedience? What makes a just law?  Is there really a conflict between scientists and saints?  Religion and Science?  The Bible and \\"Origin of Species?\\"  Which is authoritative-the Bible or Science, or some combination of both?  And the crucial question: Is evolution true?<br />We are familiar with the set up, although in the play, the names have been changed to protect the innocent: Bertrand Cates (Scopes) teaches evolution, and is arrested for breaking the law.  The ACLU hires Henry Drummond (Clarence Darrow) to defend Cates.  The broader aspects and implications of the discussion of evolution was understood by Matthew Harrison Brady (William Jennings Bryan), who say this as \\"a contest between evolution and Christianity . . . a dual to the death.\\"<br />An OJ-esque circus atmosphere surrounded the trial, as would be expected.  The trial went along rather plainly, until Drummond decides to put Brady on the stand as an expert witness on the Bible.  He then begins to cross examine and impugn the Bible, citing contradictions and inconsistencies in the Bible, much in the same way Thomas Paine had don in \\"Age of Reason.\\"<br />Of course, the fundamentalist Bryan cannot defend the inconsistencies in the Bible, so he is left to an emotional ranting.  Despite Drummonds' maneuver, which ranks up there with \\"You're no Jack Kennedy,\\" Cates is convicted, and Brady dies in the courthouse giving a frantic speech defending the Bible.<br />I believe all playwrights are subversive, and that is what makes them so exciting!  Indeed, this small drama is far better recognized and knows than the original events.  This play has for all purposes taken a life on it's own.  It is a good work for what it does-to show the importance of standing up for conscience and freedom of the mind.  Even thought the world is mostly free now, there are still pockets of tyranny that suck the souls out of their citizens.  Plays like this make you think.<br />As I mentioned, this is drama, and dramatic licenece has been taken.  Some of the facts taken out of the play are rather revealing.  For instance, the ACLU wanted to do a test case challenging the Butler Law, and solicited volunteers in a newspaper ad. So this really wasn't solely a matter of conscience, or freedom of thought, but also a political agenda on the part of the ACLU.  Another very tendcer fact that was left out was that William Jennings Bryant paid Scopes $100 fine.  No hard feelings there.  But the way, Bryan did die several days after the trial quietly in his sleep, and not grandstanding at the courthouse.<br />The only other aspect of the play that bothered me is that there is only one witty character, namely Drummond, who gets all the bumper-sticker lines and clinch quotes.  This is a mistake that many playwrights make, such as Robert Bolt who gave Sir Thomas More all of the good quips and quotes, but ignored everyone else.  I know that this is done to highlight and emphasize the protagonist, but I think it would be far, far interesting to have two witty characters that are so similar that it is hard to tell who is the protagonist and who is the antagonists.n the courthouse giving a frantic speech defending the Bible.<br />I believe all playwrights are subversive, and that is what makes them so exciting!

This book caught my fancy since it is so odd!<br />We all know and love Dr. Seuss, and his Grinch story has become part of our secular Christmas cannon, which has secured his immortality.  But I never knew that he drew political cartoons!<br />This book covers about three years during World War II where Theodore Geisel (note his German surname) drew political cartoons.  The cartoons have several distinct characteristics:  First, they are quite patriotic, and in light the holocaust and of our current conflagration, we know that he did the right thing.  Another thing is that they are very pro-war-remember the German surname.  He knew that we were in the right in fighting this just war.  Lastly, he was quite a sever critic of the isolationists, especially Charles Lindbergh (note *his* German surname).<br />The art has the familiar whimsy that characterizes his other more famous books.  His US eagle looks more like an ostrich.  What I found fascinating is that you see some drawings and images that appear in his children's books.  For example, on page 182, you see an elephant that is a perfectly drawn Horton, from \\"Horton Hears a Who,\\" and \\"Horton Hatches an Egg.\\"  Another design is on page 244, where he drew a stack of turtles in a victory \\"V\\" shape, which looks suspiciously like \\"Yertle the Turtle.\\"<br />The best drawings in this book are of Hitler.  In some magical way, Dr. Seuss has captures the sick hubris that was our little Adolph.  He draws him with his eyes closed, in a cocky indifference to the world around him.  He has that ragged little toothbrush moustache.  But I think the position of the head, the stuck-up nose, coupled with lifted eyebrows coveys the back essence of the man.  This design belongs in a holocaust museum, since it is more than a cartoon, more than a caricature, but is more like a drawing of Hitler's smug soul.<br />This book is not for your children, but more for a die-hard Seuss fan, a pop-culture historian, or a weirdo eccentric eclectic like myself.  I guess you could say this the gift for someone with everything.  The sheer shock value of this book is worth the price of printing!<br />There commentary on the cartoons, explaining the issues and the targets of Seuss's wicked quill.

So we all had to plow throught this poem wit its unpronounceable names, and far-off places that one on has ever heard of.<br />So why bother? I think that Joseph Cambell has made the point over and over again that there is more to these stories than mere entertainement. These legends were not only history, but they were also CULTURE, intended to CULTIVATE a civilization. We learn of order, honor, and duty as were read a rough legend as Beowulf. These legends held socitey togeather. We studied them in our English classes, but we should be reading them in our history, philosophy, and relgious classes too. Ther is more to these stories than a good time.<br />There are two main drawback to this translation. The first is that it is in prose form, rather than the poetic form, so we loose some of the majesty of the tale. The early classics were alays poems, not only toaid in memeory, but to set it apart from normal conversation. This was to be sacred words describing sacred events.<br />The second problem, is that the translation is very rough and wordy. The essence of poetry is is brevity--quick thoughts quickly spoken. The wordiness almosrt makes this poem a transliteration rather than a translation. It is not converational English, but sounds like it was done by a musty scholar to appease other musty scholars.<br />I reccomed Seamus Heaney's recent translation. The pome has been given a second birth by this smmmother and even poetric translation. His version is converational, firendly, and has the spark of genius that you woyuld expect from a Nobel lauriate.	2002-04-16

This book is the essential companion to the movie. Or do I have it backwards?<br />So, to what lengths will a man go to keep his honor?  Is everything for sale?  This is the story of conscience over expediency, which is a message we need right here, right now, especially in DC. The problem with politics and principles is perennial, but it has become a bit more exacerbated with the war on terrorism.<br />We rally behind More since he stands up for conscious.  It is an interesting dilemma, since we might criticize him for not being more vocal or proactive in his stand against the king, but More does say that God made \\"man to serve him wittingly, in the tangle of his mind! If he suffers us to fall to such a case that there is no escaping, then we may stand our tackle as best we can. . . But it's God's part, not our own, to bring ourselves to that extremity!  Our natural business lies in escaping!\\" (p. 126)<br />The best plays are the ones that make you think yeas after you experience them.  This is Bolt's spell, and we can never escape.<br />This is almost a perfect play. The only flaw is that More ends up with the best one liners, while the antagonists Henry VIII and Cromwell have lifeless lines without the wit and sparkle speeches that Bolt have given to More.<br />One of the intriguing aspects of this play is all the subplots, or rather, ripples across the ocean of events.  These sub-plays augment an already powerful story, and help bring more light and detail to the story.<br />One ripple is Richard Rich. He is a young man with burning ambition.  More wisely counsels him to become a teacher, instead of involving himself in affairs of court.  Rich ignores the counsel, gets caught up in the sausage-machine of state, and eventually perjures himself in More's trial.  More did not have a price; Rich's price was Wales.<br />Henry VIII is another backgound mover, and the driver of the events in the play.  He wants an heir, but at what price?  The dynastic wars had just been settled, and his line was established, but he had no heir. Harry VIII was a bit of a playboy like Harry V, but Harry V eventually grew up.  Henry VIII went to every extraordinary extreme to have an heir, from marrying his wife, to divorcing his wife, establishing a new church to soothe his conscience, and finally sanction the death of his one and only loyal friend.  His price was his pride.<br />Another sub-ripple was the romance between Margaret More and William Roper.  Thomas was, of course, a staunch Catholic, but Roper was a new Lutheran, and there was religious tension.  Thomas forbade his daughter Margaret from marrying Roper until he returned to Catholicism.<br />Two characters were almost ignored in the play: Wolsey and Alice More, but I guess that you can't have everything in a two-act play.  Sigh!<br />The 1966 film adaptation left out another sub-plot Senor Chapuys, the Spanish ambassador.  Since Katharine was from Aragon, Catholic Spain had quite an interest in having the first marriage remain in tact.<br />Aside from reading a history book on the man and the time, I would recommend the companion classic of Shakespeare's play \\"Henry VIII,\\" which tells how Wolsey accidentally got Anne Bolyn and Henry VIII together at a dinner party, and how Wolsey fell out of favor with the King.  Surprisingly, Shakespeare only mentions More once (III.ii.468), but we understand the edgy politics during Shakespeare's day.<br />Bolts quick wit and ability to compress complex ideas into compact catchphrases, what are called \\"bumper-sticker\\" lines in the film industry.

It analyzes the cellular biochemistry as an evidence for the intelligent design of the cell.  So this book is bound to create many sparks.<br />I am not a biochemist, nor is my training in the hard sciences.  My background is in history and political science, so I am inept at commenting on the science and the data Dr. Behe musters.  I can just review the book as a layman for laymen.  C. S. Lewis said, \\"It often happens that two schoolboys can solve difficulties in their work for one another better than their master can.  When you took the problem to a master, as we all remember, he was very likely what you understood already, to add a great deal of information which you didn't want and say nothing at all about the thing that was puzzling you.\\" (Reflections on the Psalms, ch. 1)  Moreover, Thomas Jefferson said, \\"State a moral case to a ploughman and a professor. The former will decide it as well, and often better than the latter, because he has not been led astray by artificial rules.\\" (Thomas Jefferson to Peter Carr, 1787)  Dr. Behe is re-examining those \\"artificial rules\\" of science.<br />This book comes in three parts.  The first two chapters contain a concise overview of what he is talking about.  I found that the first chapters are a book in their own right and provides a perfect overview.  He introduces the idea of \\"irreducible complexity,\\" and his now-famous mousetrap analogy.<br />The second section deals with the data.  Dr. Behe warns  \\"So, as a writer who wants people to read my work, I face a dilemma: people hate to read details, yet the story of the impact of biochemistry on evolutionary theory rests solely on the details.\\" (p. xii)  He therefore sets apart the technical text with a small box.  He suggests that we skim the section just to get a feel of the ultra-complexities involved in the biochemical processes.<br />He takes five case studies: cellular cilia and flagella; the blood clotting process; protein production; the immune system; and AMP production.  I confess that these sections lost me, even with the semi-familiar diagrams.  Basically, the cell isn't homogeneous blob of protoplasm, but is more along the lines of a complex machine along the lines of the space shuttle or an aircraft carrier.  However, unlike the carrier, which can operate without paint, all of the screws or elevators, inside the cell each piece of sub-cellular machinery is necessary for the cell to function.<br />The problem then is for the two theories of evolution, either gradualism or punctuated equilibrium, to account for how this machine got together in the first place.  No one has been able to do this.<br />In the third part of the book, Dr. Behe takes a step back, and does a more philosophical analysis of the implications of the data.  He begins with a study of the literature, specifically the \\"Journal of Molecular Evolution,\\" and \\"Proceedings of the National Academy of Science,\\" several books, and two college textbooks, and points out that evolution is presented but never explained.<br />He asserts that \\"No one at Harvard University, no one at the National Institutes of Health, no member of the National Academy of Science, no Nobel prize winner-no one at all can give a detailed account of how the cilium, or vision, or blood-clotting, or any complex biochemical process might have developed in a Darwinian fashion.  But here we are.  Plants and animals are here.  The complex systems are here.  All things are here somehow: if not in a Darwinian fashion, then how?\\" (p. 187)<br />Behe says that the evidence points to intelligent design for the cell.  He asserts, \\"The conclusion of intelligent design flows naturally from the data itself-not from sacred books or sectarian belief.\\" (193)  To his credit, this is where he stops.  I believe that you cannot go from the order in the cell to the Russian Orthodox practice of triple baptism.  In some ways, this section is a bit disappointing since if you grant that there is an intelligent designer, the then who or what is he/she/it?  For what purpose were cells, and therefore `we\\" were created?  We cannot solve these problems from the data, but this is the Pandora's box that he has opened when he broke the seal on Darwin's black box.<br />He handles several objections to the idea of intelligent design, that we should not attach any specific theological dogma to the idea.  He also refutes several questions, such as the panda's thumb and the blind spot on the retina, plus the issue of vestigial organs.  He pitches softball answers to these questions, primarily since they are gross anatomy questions and not biochemical questions.<br />He brings up, but does not elaborate on the historical aspect of Evolution, which is up my academic alley.  Historical data differs from scientific data.  For example, I cannot scientifically prove that the Continental Congress ever happened, since it was a singular historic event.  We infer from the diaries, journals, letters, newspapers, and documents such as the Declaration of Independence to prove it.  But I cannot reconstruct the event here and now.  Evolution is also an historical event, so we have to follow historical methods to discover what exactly happened.  Paleontology is not a science, but is a branch of history.  It fits somewhere between archeology and cosmology.<br />The last chapter discusses the philosophy of science and the a priori assumption that excludes supernatural explanations for the phenomenon.  The problem is that they are trying to avoid a \\"God of the gaps,\\" which is to say that anything that cannot be explained will always be explained by God's handiwork.  The problem is that a \\"science of the spaces\\" ensues.  It is the same problem but uses different mortar to fill the spaces in the bricks of data. The question is no longer science, but one of philosophy.<br />Behe has quite a quill.  No mumbo jumbo. Easy read!s an intelligent designer, the then who or what is he/she/it?

The title of this book is a bit misleading, since I'm not sure that we can find the essence of a man as broad as B. H. Roberts. Moreover, the selection of entries has an emphasis on his quote-unquote \\"controversial\\" works, which I think is more of a reflection of the publishing house than the man. Roberts himself wrote a summery of this thought called \\"The Truth, The Way, the Life,\\" but as for finding a B. H. Roberts quote book, one does not exist.<br />This book is compilation of several talks and writings over his long and turbulent life. Several of the entries are from his Autobiographical notes. Admittedly, Roberts led quite a turbulent life, and being a General Authority with a strong drive (Madsen calls him a \\"scrapper\\"), he was always in the midst of things and events. This book then is a reflection not only of the man, but also of his times.<br />Roberts has a powerful rhetorical style that shines through the dry ink on the dead page. I wish we had a recording of his voice, since it must have been powerful. He had a gift of expression, and so many inadvertent Shakespearian allusions creep in, showing how well read he was. You are always concerned about a man's ideas and his testimony, and this book covers both exceptionally well.<br />The last chapter is the much discussed journal entry where he gives several frank statements, especially about the book of Mormon. There are several logical traps that we can fall into by making hasty generalizations from one journal entry. We are not sure if this was a real concern, or if he was just letting off steam. Several of the archeological issues raised couldn't have been answered in his day, but that is more of a criticism of haphazard archeology than the Book of Mormon. The nature of archeology, which isn't a science, is more \\"luck of the draw\\" in studying what survives than intelligent design and intelesis. It is interesting to note that the discussion occurred in August 1933, and six years later Hugh Nibley finished his doctorate, and was able to answer many of Roberts' concerns.<br />Moreover, there is more to the Book of Mormon than archeology. Its greatest asset is its theological and spiritual evidence, which most people ignore since it is unassailable. Moreover, as Nibley points out, the book itself is a problem since it had to come from somewhere, and no one else has ever done anything like, \\"Dianetics\\" notwithstanding!<br />I am surprised at the rise of all things Roberts since the publication of \\"The Truth, The Way, The Life.\\" What is unusual is not so much the concern for the man, as is the concern for the image of the man. People want him to be unconventional and fringe. However, his writings and discourses don't bear this out. Truman G.

This collection of books is the one and only OFFICIAL reference books used and allowed by missionaries of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.  It would, therefore, be helpful fro any prospective missionaries to get this library and basically memorize all of the books.  If you can't memorize these books, then whatever progress you do make will be helpful.<br />The books are:<br />\\"Jesus the Christ\\":  The biography of Jesus Christ written by Elder James E. Talmage at request of the First Presidency.  For a while it was the textbook for our Sunday schools. It is the best one-volume biography on the Savior.  Once you finish reading this book, go on to Elder Bruce R. McConkie's six-volume \\"Messiah\\" Series.<br />\\"Articles of Faith\\":  Also by Elder Talmage, this is a study of that famous list of doctrines that Joseph Smith snapped off at the end of the Wentworth letter.  This book gets you on sure doctrinal ground.  One you finish reading this book, go on to read Elder McConkie's \\"New Witness for the Articles of Faith.\\"<br />\\"Truth Restored/Gospel Principles\\":  This two-fer is an interesting coupling.  The first book is a slim history of the Church written by President Gordon B. Hinckley.  The second volume is \\"Gospel Principles,\\" which is a great manual for new members, which is also another doctrinal reference book.  One of my former bishops said that it was the best manual the Church ever produced.  I agree.  Everything is plain and simple and well organized.<br />\\"A Marvelous Work and a Wonder\\":  This is the classic written by Elder LeGrand Richards w here he covers many of the gospel subjects within the context of missionary work, and in terms of how investigators would understand and along the type of questions they would ask.<br />\\"Our Search For Happiness\\":  This one is the new kid on the block.  Elder Ballard in his unassuming style wrote this book to increase understanding among members of the church and non-members.  It follows his peaceful turn of the mind is quite conversational.

People perceive, and it is sad to say that they perceive with good reason, that Christianity is mere mind-fluff, and that what is holding back Christianity is the Christians.<br />This book is a discussion of what is behind Christianity, and provides a philosophical framework in which to defend Christianity.  It is written at the college level, since it is intended to be an apologetics resource for college students.  I marvel at the way that Dr. Craig brought together so many ideas from so many resources in this book.  It found that I used almost every facet of my undergraduate education in understanding the ideas and evidences he used.  Most helpful was my survey of philosophy and my hard science classes.<br />This book is divided along six headings: Faith, Man, God, Creation, Sacred Scripture, and Christ.  Each chapter is in turn divided along several sub-headings: the Historical Background of the question, an Assessment of the question as it currently stands, and a Practical Application, where Dr. Craig discusses how \\"the rubber meets the road\\" is discussing this issue with those curious about Christianity.<br />This is not a bash book, nor is it a survey on \\"how to hate,\\" but rather it is geared to a thoughtful and ponderous evaluation of many evidences of the truthfulness of Christianity.  For example, in Chapter 2, Craig discusses the existential absurdity of life without God.  He raises the question of where we get absolute values, and how life becomes meaningful if we are merely a cosmic accident or a galactic hiccup.  This is the one question that the atheist, or \\"atheist-arguing-agnosticism\\" cannot answer: if there are no moral absolutes, then why not torture babies for sheer pleasure.  After all, it has been done before.<br />Then in Chapter 3, Dr. Craig discusses the existence of God as evidenced by the Big Bang.  The chapter isn't physic-heavy (It doesn't even have one equation), but it does discuss the implications of having an absolute time for creation.  Craig relies heavily on the \\"Kalam\\" argument by Al-Ghazali, which, simply put, is: \\"Everything that began had a cause.  The Universe began.  Therefore it had a cause.\\"  Then the question becomes a discussion of who or what is the causal agent in the universe.<br />The prose is quite clear, so there is no pedantry or confusion with what you read.  I found that this book was quite a pleasure to read, and it made me take several longer looks at my faith.  The concluding chapter is a gem.  Dr. Craig states that the ultimate apologetic is Christian love.  Against such love, there is no argument.of having an absolute time for creation.

I used to think that Hyrum W. Smith was a rough and tumble, hard line executive type whose first and only lust was the bottom line.<br />I was so wrong.<br />This is a pleasant book with a conversational tone, along the lines of Dale Carnegie. I wish my other books were so simple, and were plainly written and plainly taught. Shakespeare mentions \\"Simple truth miscalled simplicity,\\" (Sonnet 66) and that \\"Brevity is the soul of wit.\\" (Hamlet, Act 2, sc. ii), and Mr. Smith demonstrates his ability, again and again, to plainly teach the ten natural laws.<br />In fact, the tone of this book is almost grandfatherly.<br />The book is divided into two halves, the first half dealing with your time, the second half dealing with your life.<br />The first laws are (Don't get mad-you could Xerox these from a library copy!):<br />1. You control your life by controlling your time.<br />2. Your governing values are the foundation of personal fulfillment.<br />3. When your daily activities reflect your governing values, you experience inner peace.<br />4. To reach any significant goal, you must leave your comfort zone.<br />5. Daily planning leverages time through increased focus.<br />The laws regarding controlling your life are:<br />6. Your behavior is a reflection of what you truly believe.<br />7. You satisfy needs when your beliefs are line with reality.<br />8. Negative behaviors are overcome by changing incorrect beliefs.<br />9. Your self-esteem must ultimately come from within.<br />10.  Give more, and you'll have more.<br />I think that the central principles are first, controlling your life and not being controlled, and second there is an objective reality, despite all the braying and bleating of the relativists. The issue, then is one of organizing and prioritizing, and not just being a forty-year old teenager living from stimulation to stimulation.<br />As has been observed, this book is geared for the big business executive, but I have found that I can adapt the principles to my less busy and less hectic life. That may be another underlying factor: wanting to want something. You must want the principles to work for them to be effective. \\"Stick-to-itiveness\\" I think is the word.<br />There has also been comment about the values and the similarities of this book to other books, specifically Covey's \\"Seven Habits.\\" It shouldn't be surprising, since all the arrows of moral laws hit one target. We do not have a male and a female law of gravitation, and the electrons do not drive on the wrong side of the road in the UK. We are all talking about the same thing. C. S. Lewis in \\"The Abolition of Man,\\" traces the similarity of moral laws across many cultures and time. True, manifestations and understanding of truth may differ; it is all fundamentally the same. You can do math by Roman numerals, but Arabic numerals are far easier.<br />Moreover, Franklin and Covey merged a few years ago, so the two books have really become one in the hands of the company.<br />As to the hidden agenda, what can I say? If you are smart enough to spot any hidden agenda, then you are also smart enough to know how to avoid any entanglements.<br />As always, the hardest part of any self-help book is the implementation of the ideas.busy and less hectic life.

Mr. Allen in the introduction states that this book \\"is not intended as an exhaustive treatise on the much-written-upon subject of the power of thought\\" but that the book is \\"the result of meditation and experience\\" and that \\"it is suggestive rather than explanatory.\\"<br />This small book has 68 pages and seven chapters.  Mr. Allen has a gift of language: it is simple without being simplistic, and artful without being gaudy.  You savor his sentences as he quietly, calmly and peacefully explains different aspects of thought.<br />I think mental discipline is a long lost art.  That may be the reason why the world is in the shape it is. After all, Socrates was known as a great thinker, not a great crier, or a deep moper.  And that is why we still study him thousands of years later.  Christianity believes that we should love God not only with our hearts, but also with our minds (Matt. 22:37).  Karl G. Maeser, the second president of Brigham Young University said, \\"Not only will you be held accountable for the things you do, but you will be held responsible for the very thoughts you think.\\"<br />Moreover, Thomas Aquinas speaks of sins of thought, word and deed, and points out the progress of thoughts to action: \\"For the angry man, through desire of vengeance, is at first disturbed in thought, then he breaks out into words of abuse, and lastly he goes on to wrongful deeds; and the same applies to lust and to any other sin.\\" (ST I-II, 72,7)<br />Since what we believe determines what we do, we can change what we do by changing our thoughts.  Our bodies are added to us at birth, but beneath it all is our mind.  That is the genius of this book.<br />Favorite quotes from the book are:<br />\\"Circumstance does not make the man; it reveals it to himself.\\"<br />\\"Good thoughts and actions can never produce bad results; bad thoughts and actions can never produce good results.<br />\\"A man cannot directly choose his circumstances, but he can choose his thoughts, and so indirectly, yet surely, shape his circumstances.\\"<br />The only odd thing about this book, besides its awesome focus and startling profundity is that Mr. Allen never mentions that the source of his book's title is from the Bible: \\"For as he thinketh in his heart, so is he.\\" (Psalms 23:7)  Mr. Allen seems to be a Thoreau-esque type of free spirit and freethinker, and was an admirer of Buddha (See chapter 6). He may not have known the source of his idea, which is too bad, since there the Bible is full of good thoughts like this one./>\\"A man cannot directly choose his circumstances, but he can choose his thoughts, and so indirectly, yet surely, shape his circumstances.\\"<br />The only odd thing about this book, besides its awesome focus and startling profundity is that Mr. Allen never mentions that the source of his book's title is from the Bible: \\"For as he thinketh in his heart, so is he.\\" (Psalms 23:7)  Mr. Allen seems to be a Thoreau-esque type of free spirit and freethinker, and was an admirer of Buddha (See chapter 6).

No, the ultimate triumph is in the ultimate miracle: for the first time in the history of mankind, one who was dead raised himself into living immortality. He was the Son of God, the Son of our immortal Father in Heaven, and his triumph over physical and spiritual death is the good news every Christian tongue should speak.\\"<br />--Howard W. Hunter, page 84.<br />This is my new favorite book.  I hope it starts appearing at baptisms, confirmations, ordinations, farewells, and in Christmas stockings.<br />As Joseph Smith taught, the atonement is the central doctrine, with all other things being mere appendages (Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith, 121).  This book, then, focuses us on this one thing that matters most.  This book has selections from both the prophets and the scholars.<br />Contributors include Presidents Howard W. Hunter, John Taylor, and Bruce R. McConkie.  In fact the first entry is by Joseph Fielding Smith, so it starts out on the right foot.  But other contributors are Chieko Okazaki, Sheri Dew, and Ardeth Kapp, so we have the distaff adding testimony. There are even quotes by Hugh Nibley, Gerald Lund, and it also has Steven Robinson's \\"Parable of the Bicycle,\\" so all the bases are covered.<br />Also included are Orson F. Whitney's, and Melvin J. Ballard's visions of the Savior<br />Two criticisms:  There is no index, just a table of contents, and they missed Joseph Smith's quote that I alluded to earlier.  The first is forgivable, the second isn't.  They also missed Lorenzo Snow's, David O. McKay's and David B. Haight's visions of the Savior (Ensign, Nov. 1989).  People at Desert Book can e-mail me for more comments.<br />This is not a \\"brass-knuckles\\" doctrinal treatise, but a soft, reassuring testimony of Christ and how His atonement applies in our lives.  Indeed, this book provides a great way to buttress talks, testimonies, and lessons with verifiable and reliable statements on the Savior.<br />I have nothing but raves about the packaging.  The book is both informative and beautiful.  The profound picture fix the passion and emotion associated with Christ's life.  Philosopher Adam Smith pointed out in his \\"Theory on Moral Sentiments\\" that sight was the key to moral feelings, and they have capitalized on our capacity to feel by sight.<br />This book provides a great overview of the Atonement from many authors and many points of view.

I am not a fan of devotional books, since I believe that we shouldn't drink below the horses.  I am smart enough to read and understand the Bible on my own, and I don't want to get caught in any intellectual ruts.  Moreover, most devotional books seem like mere mush or breadcrumbs when compared to the Bread of Life.<br />However, this little devotional book by Oswald Chambers absolutely blew me out of the water!  He has a piercing intellect and power of expression that man, indeed, most preacher lack.  So much of the pap, tripe, and mushy \\"Godtalk\\" that makes up the spiritual feasts chokes and gags me.  This book, on the other hand, gets to the heart and core of serious discipleship.  Discipline is the essence of discipleship.<br />Although this isn't a quote book per se, but it has great thought gems:<br />\\"You could read volumes on the work of the Holy Spirit, when five minutes of total, uncompromising obedience would make things as clear as sunlight.\\" (10 October)<br />\\"If we do only what we feel inclined to do, some of us would never do anything.\\" (25 April)<br />I think one of the deepest quotes is:<br />\\"If we obey God, it is going to cost other people more than it costs us, and that is where the pain begins. . . If we obey God, it will mean that other people's plans are upset\\" (11 January)<br />Admittedly, Chambers is British, so the wording can seem more like a contraption than clear conviction, but I think all good things are worth working for.  By the way, the Briticisms are great in understanding Shakespeare.  The British have better diction, pronunciation, and far more wit than we Americans.<br />This book is also commendable for having a leap-day entry.  Most devotionals skip the skipping day.  I think this one detail illustrates the care that the editors have given this book.	2002-03-14

I really don't think we can put Hugh Nibley into a book, much less a box.  But this book comes in third, after \\"Approaching Zion,\\" and \\"Temple and Cosmos: Beyond This Ignorant Present.\\"<br />This book covers the Joseph Smith ground, and deals with the long and noble tradition of telling tales about Joseph Smith.  It is really an omnibus reprint of several other books.<br />\\"No Ma'am, That's Not History.\\"  This is Nibley's famous response to Fawn Brodie's \\"No Man Knows My History.\\"  This book, or booklet, can be read in one setting, but it is a sound and full refutation of Brodie's rather overrated book.  I have read it, and, no, it is not a slam-dunk.  Aside from its original purpose of outlining Brodie's absurdities, it also demonstrates Nibley's methodology in responding to the critics:  he has the primary sources in order, and uses a scathing and well-honed logic to lustrate his points.  This mini-book is a great gateway for Nibley novices.<br />\\"A Note on F. M. Brodie.\\"  This article rounds out Nibley's discussion on Brodie, and serves as a coda and outro to the previous section.<br />\\"Censoring the Joseph Smith Story.\\"  This is one of the funniest history you will ever read.  Nibley runs among the footnotes of Anti-Mormon literature, and illustrates how the stories of Joseph Smith have been embellishes and exaggerated over time, as one anti-Mormon critic mindlessly quotes another, without ever reading the primary documents.  It is a good illustration of not only the perils of plagiarism, but of the childhood game of \\"Telephone.\\"<br />\\"The Myth Makers.\\"  This book is the transcript of the celebrated court case of \\"Joseph Smith v. The World.\\" We Nibley's Shakespearian background shines through in this acidic and stinging satire.  It reads as a play, or a Socratic dialogue, where every one of Smith's critics since Dogberry takes the stand against Joseph Smith.  The key, and the very subtle point to this book, is that Joseph Smith never takes the stand.<br />\\"Sounding Brass.\\"  This book deals specifically about the tall tales surrounding Brigham Young, and his plural wives.  It deals with the later anti-Mormon literature, especially about the book \\"Wife No. 19.\\"  The crown jewel of this book is Part 3: How To Write An anti-Mormon Book (A Handbook for Beginners).  Nibley lists the 35 rules essential for any and every anti-Mormon book.  I think Rule 17: \\"In Place of Evidence, Use Rhetoric!\\" (p. 495ff) should be memorized by every undergrad everywhere, since we fall prey to rhetoric so easily.  One I understood this rule, my mind was reborn into a whole new and better organ.  There is a difference between rhetoric and evidence.

It deals with the later anti-Mormon literature, especially about the book \\"Wife No. 19.\\"  The crown jewel of this book is Part 3: How To Write An anti-Mormon Book (A Handbook for Beginners).  Nibley lists the 35 rules essential for any and every anti-Mormon book.  I think Rule 17: \\"In Place of Evidence, Use Rhetoric!\\" (p. 495ff) should be memorized by every undergrad everywhere, since we fall prey to rhetoric so easily.  One I understood this rule, my mind was reborn into a whole new and better organ.  There is a difference between rhetoric and evidence.

For the person in a hurry, but who is also curious about history, I would recommend this book.  It is the culmination of a survey of history that Will and Ariel Durrant did in the 1960's.  I realize that some of the conclusions have been dated, such as concern about the Soviet Union, but that does not destroy the value of the work.  Indeed, who is to say that the Soviet Union, or some neo-Tsarist regime, could not rise again?<br />Moreover, this book covers other topics, all of them revolving around the \\"Human Predicament,\\" which is basically a choice between freedom and security.  Or better yet, actual freedom, and claimed security, since if you chose security over freedom, you will lose both freedom and security.<br />This book is an easy read, written on the high-school level, so there are no excuses for not understanding anything.  It is an essential in anyone's collection of \\"Great Books,\\" since not only is the unexamined life not worth living, the unexamined civilization is not worth preserving.  And we can make a change in things.	2002-03-09

Mr. McDowell has a very pleasing style that has a soft and gentle touch to what he says, so I don't see how anyone could be offended at this book.  After all, tolerance is a two way street.  Moreover, tolerance should always be coupled with curiosity.  I am willing to give the crackpot and the loudmouth his or her day in court, just out of respect and curiosity for other people's opinions.<br />This book covers the normal apologetic points, such as the \\"Liar, Lunatic, or Lord\\" syllogism.  Mr. McDowell also discusses the scientific data that support the Christian message.  Yes, scientific data does support Christianity.  He also discusses the higher criticism data, which is the textual integrity of the Bible.  Another point is that is fascination is Chapter Five, which shows how the character of the apostles changed after the Resurrection.  It is the old \\"Two Peters Problem\\":  You have the Peter of the Gospels who is rash, brash, and denied knowing the Lord.  Then you have the other Peter standing firm before the Sanhedrin, and eventually being crucified for his faith.  What caused this radical change, to the point where it looks like that there were two different Peters?  Something drastic happened to this man, and what it was, was the Resurrection.<br />This book is an excellent overview of Christian Apologetics.  The arguments are easy to memorize and to articulate.  It is also a good read for someone intimidated by the Bible, or who is curious about what we Christians really believe and why.	2002-03-09

What jumps out of this book are the things that you don't expect. There is so much oddball humor in this book that it makes \\"the Trouble With Tribbles\\" look like funeral service. For example, Q reveals that secret of the universe is the avocado. The hinge of this book is a quick fling that Lwaxana Troi has with Q. Of course, this pre-dates the flirting that Q had with Janeway, but, hey, that series haws been cancelled.<br />Lwaxana Troi and Q together-why it reminds me of the Honeymooners! You see great character interaction, which is the best part of any story, since special effects are getting so boring since they are so easy to do. And people are the reason why we are here on earth, anyways.<br />I think this book would be a great for a reunion episode, although I don't think it could be recycled for \\"Enterprise.\\" Q would be no problem to introduce into the series, but you need Majel Barret to spar with him and push the godling around.<br />The subplots are also gems, one of which is Wesley getting an alien love slave that he doesn't want. She is agreeable to everything, but he isn't. Funniest line in the book : Slave to Wesley \\"I'm sorry fro apologizing.\\" Peter David makes Wesley Crush look good.

I have dabbled here and there with the Star Trek novels, but found that they seemed to have been sneezed out by hacks, and lacked depth, substance, and that special spark that ignites a blaze of wonder.<br />This book was different. It had depth and hard core complexity that you would expect from the X-men, but never see in a watered-down TV series.  The premise is that Trelaine, the \\"Squire of Gothos\\" from TOS was actually a young Q and the John de Lancie Q was charged with \\"babysitting\\" him.  Q, at a loss what to do, gets Picard, the galaxy's expert on childhood development, to help him watch the youngling.<br />Then it goes down hill from there . . .<br />The book has a complex structure since we are keeping track of three parallel time lines that Trelaine mischievously mucks up. On top of that, they are not sequential, so we are getting a \\"Citizen Kane\\" non-linear story that stretches the mind.  Don't worry, ther are only three lines, so you won't get thatconfused. I hope!<br />Peter David demonstrates his understanding of the complex Star Trek universe, and did something that the TNG series really didn't do, which was to unite the two series.  We had a few references here and there to past episodes and situations, such as the Daystrom Institute, but the series seemed to have had a split-brain operation.  How many times did we see the Gorns, Metrons, the Melkots, or the Andorians in TNG?<br />Moreover, Jack Crusher, Dr. Beverly's dead husband appears in a parallel time line, and the multiple Lt. Cmdr. Datas absolutely tore my head off.  There is even a vague reference to Kira, the Bejoran from \\"Deep Space 9.\\"  David rewards the faithful viewers!<br />This book would make a great miniseries, although it is too complex for a film, as \\"Back to the Future II\\" demonstrated.  It has everything you could ever want in a novel.	2002-03-01

I always find Dr. Zacharias' approach to the great and terrible issues of our day to be sound, clear, and well thought out, with the entire logical ramifications in perfect order.  Moreover, Dr. Zacharias has that rare ability to meld mind and heart in his theology, so much so, that I prefer his style to many of his more popular peers.<br />So what are we to make of the 9/11 attacks?  Dr. Zacharias devotes six chapters, plus an appendix to covering this vexing question.  I suggest reading the appendix first, got get a thumbnail of the arguments used in this rather slim book.<br />Chapter One sets the stage for the book, reminding us of what all this worry is about.  Our memories too often are like the Short Attention Span Theater, with all segments not being over seven minutes.  Sometime reality doesn't make it to the commercial break.<br />Chapter Two is a discussion of moral absolutes.  Dr. Zacharias has come up with a concise definition of why moral relativism is bankrupt:<br />\\"Rarely have I met a true relativist.  Hidden somewhere in the words of everyone who argues for complete relativism is a belief that there are, indeed, some acts that are wrong.  The bottom line is this:  When someone says that all truth is relative, he or she is making either a relative statement or an absolute one.  If it is a relative statement, then that statement, by definition, is not always true.  On the other hand, if the belief that all truth is relative is absolute, then the very statement itself must be denied, because it denies absolutes.  The pure relativist cuts off the branch on which he is sitting while telling you the branch cannot be severed.  The landing is mind-shattering.\\" (p. 20)<br />In logic, this is called the \\"Self Inclusion Fallacy.\\"<br />In Chapter Three, Dr. Zacharias discuses the essential nature of Islam, weather it is good or bad. ...<br />I think that we make sweeping generalizations against Islam, since the key to understanding the two Islams is how one translated \\"jihad.\\"  Dr. Zacharias makes the case that Islam is not inherently evil, but that the fundamentalists have hijacked it  He spends some time discussing the blasting cap book of radical Islam, \\"The Missing Religious Precept,\\" which focused on the negative, violent definition of \\"jihad.\\"<br />Chapter Four is an interesting chapter that deals with Biblical prophecy about 9/11.  We have read the Nostradamus \\"pious frauds,\\" but this is the first time I have read a specific hermeneutic or theology on the attacks.  Dr. Zachairas focuses on the Image of Nebuchadnezzar in Daniel, and the incidents surrounding the birth of Ishmael and Isaac.  The lineage is important, since so much depends on weather Ishmael or Isaac had the birthright.<br />The question of God's presence or absence during the attack is the subject of Chapter Five.  I think Dr. Zacharias raised a poignant question, when he suggested a thought problem.  If God appeared to you, and announced his existence in all his glory and fire, would you belie?  Well, yes.  But then, suppose you then accidentally ran over you child as you were backing up.  Would you be content with you sure vision? (p. 84-89) He makes the point that we are not purely intellectual being, and that we need the whispering of the Spirit to our heart even more so.  Doesn't the Bible speak of the Holy Spirit as the Comforter?<br />He rounds off his discussion in Chapter Six with confirming our faith in God. The issue isn't death, since we will all die, but on what we do with our allotted days.<br />This book is a very gentle book, yet it has a backbone along with its brain and heart.  I recommend it for anyone wanting a strong philosophical answer to the question raised by the falling towers.neralizations against Islam, since the key to understanding the two Islams is how one translated \\"jihad.\\"  Dr. Zacharias makes the case that Islam is not inherently evil, but that the fundamentalists have hijacked it  He spends some time discussing the blasting cap book of radical Islam, \\"The Missing Religious Precept,\\" which focused on the negative, violent definition of \\"jihad.\\"<br />Chapter Four is an interesting chapter that deals with Biblical prophecy about 9/11.

We all have this spark of divinity, and power resonates with us.  We also like a good smart alec like Lucifer in Milton's \\"Paradise Lost.\\"  Q whets both of these appetites.  The Next Generation is an unusual series in that Q serves as a judge of humanity in the first and last episodes.  It is a brilliant move by Rodenberry to have these bookends that frame the discussion and the series.  There is something more than entertainment or collegiate forensics, but the actual question of humanities survival, with the Continuum as the metaphorical judges.  You see a similar device used in the last episode of \\"Seinfeld,\\" which was a clip show, but also Seinfeld on trial.  Lucky, unlike Seinfeld, Picard was not found wanting.<br />This book has all the TV series scripts that have Q, expect \\"Q and the Grey,\\" and any possible Cameo in \\"Enterprise.\\"  Aside from this one deletion, it's all here.  It is titillating to watch the development of Q from a quasi-god or Loki being that were so prevalent in The Original Series (Melkots, Metrons, Orgainians, etc), but to a likeable almost Bart Simpson character.  He was called the God of Lies, but he did let Data have a laugh.<br />This is not prose, but the actual scripts used in films, so keep that in mind whey you are buying.  Remember the trouble you had with reading Shakespeare?  Same format, so it is a little hard to read, and you need John de Lancie to breathe life into this one letter character.<br />There are several photos from the episodes, although I wish we had a better picture of the Continuum from \\"Death Wish.\\"  But the Q-Zone novel trilogy paints a better picture than they did with the voyager episode.<br />Aside from that one caveat, I recommend this for any Q-aholic as myself.  Except for \\"Encounter at Farpoint,\\" and \\"All Good Things,\\" these episodes have not been novelized. This is your only source for the acid lines, with and wisdom of our favorite being.	2002-03-01

The 1979 version of the Bible that the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints uses has most of the best changes, but not all.  This book fills in the gap.<br />It has a user-friendly format that focuses only on the revised verses.  Each page is a double column, with the JST on the left-hand column, and the KJV version on the right-hand column.  Be cautious--sometimes Jospeh Smith only corrected the punctuation in a verse.<br />It has introductory essays about how we got the Joseph Smith Translation.  Admittedly, they are written from the point of vierw of the Community of Christ (the new name for the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints), but they are helpful in any case.<br />I use this version since it has what I need where I need it.	2002-02-25

This is the interpretative history of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, written by B. H. Roberts to commemorate the Church's centennial in 1930.  It differs from the \\"History of the Church,\\" also known also as the \\"Documentary History of the Church,\\" because the straightforward history of the Church is just Joseph Smith's history and journals-raw data-but does not have any analysis or explanation.  Moreover, the straightforward History of the Church only covers 1805-1844, with a seventh volume covering the exodus, while the Comprehensive History of the Church covers 1830-1930.<br />Both are good, and you have Elder Roberts' keen eye and sharp mind handling some of the most intense times, spiritually speaking, in the history of the world.	2002-02-25

The good is that it is easier to find what Joseph Smith said on a subject. The bad is that the context and the flow of the Prophet's logic is lost, so I use this book in conjuction with &quot;Teachings.&quot; For example: the King Follet Discourse gets pretty hacked up by ellipses, But that is the hazard of having a &quot;quote book,&quot; along with having someone else do your editing for you.<br />Some of the extras that are included in this book are eight accounts of the First Vision, and the poetic version of Section 76-&quot;The Vision.&quot; The Editors also include reminisces from &quot;They Knew the Prophet,&quot; and quotes from Journal of Discourses, when Church leaders quoted something the Prophet said that is not recoded elswhere. It is wonderful to see these gems get broader circulation, and hopefully, they will begin to percolate into our Sunday Schoool lessons and into our lives.<br />The biggest compliment that I have is that I teach Sunday School lessons with this book.<br />My only complaint is that there were some reminisces found in &quot;Discourses of Wilford Woodruff,&quot; and one or two other quotes from Joseph Smith that would have been nice to include in the book. And it would have been nice to see the Wentworth letter in an appendix. But it is a thick enough book as it is.<br />Despite my one or two criticsms, this is a great book. Five stars!	2002-02-24

This edition of \\"Interpretation of Dreams\\" hits all the marks-it has extensive introductory notes, bibliography, and a more than adequate index.  Moreover, specific dreams in the text are referenced in a separate index.  They also have the English translations of the foreign-language footnotes, which is always helful for those of us who only speak three and not seven languages.  The editors understand all facets of \\"user friendly,\\" which means that this book not only friendly to the user, but friendly for use.  It has every bell and whistle that any student, scholar, or savant could want in a book, which is a rare thing.<br />Moreover, the cover art is very eye catching, since the blurred water-color profiles have a dream-like quality about them, reinforcing, but not distracting from the books subject and contents.  In many ways, the book is the cover.<br />I admire the heavy secondary research Freud put into his book.  Keeping in mind Freud's ideas were gestating in the late 1800's, when there was none of the perfected scientific research and research methods that we have today.  Like Darwin, Galileo, or Newton, Freud did so much with so little in the way of technological gizmos.  This adds even a greater luster to his genius.<br />However, there are two issues I have with Dr. Freud's methodology.  First, his has a very odd universe of sampling, namely himself and his neurotic patients (136, 138).  First of all, relying on his own dreams for analysis tends to make his research solipsistic, which is to say we may be looking more at Freud than his research and conclusions.  Moreover, relying on neurotic patients does not yield statistically balanced data.  His skewed sampling leads to a skewed conclusion.<br />Secondly, Freud comes to the reductionist conclusion that all dreams are wish fulfillment.  Keeping in mind the strange and limited universe of sampling, it is no wonder that Freud came to this rather odd conclusion.  Part of the problem is that Freud completely ignored the creativity aspect of dreams. The classic example of the creativity in dreams is Elias Howe's invention of the sewing machine needle.  He was an English inventor trying to invent the sewing machine.  He had all the parts in place expect the needle, which was giving him problems. He fell asleep at his inventor's table and dreamt cannibals were chasing him, whose spears that had holes in the tops.  He woke up and put the hole in the top of the machine needle, and presto! A new industry.<br />I recognize that this book is an essential the historical literature of psychology.  And I have no qualms about typical and ubiquitous Freudian sexology.  Sex, or better yet reproduction, is a power drive in humanity, although I do not concede that it is the one and only drive.y ignored the creativity aspect of dreams.

Robert's autobiographical notes that he hastily dictated in his waning years.  He had enough sense of history to realize that he himself was a hot historical item.<br />The polished version is in first person, and was obviously dictated, which is an asset.  B. H. Roberts was one of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saint's greatest orators, apologists, and scrappers, so the autobiography has the same rhetorical punchy-ness that that makes reading this book pure eye candy.<br />It is written in the first person, and Elder Roberts exposes his soul as he tells of his early childhood in Dickens's England, his emigration and journey to Salt Lake City, his hardpan life in the west, and his eventual embracing of the Mormonism.  This man had one wild life, from rescuing the bodies of two missionaries that had been killed by a mob in the south, to running for the House of Representatives, and being denied a seat because he was a polygamist.<br />I confess that reading the life of the man is only half the story.  Roberts had a very keen and grabby intellect, so you need to read his philosophical and theological works in addition to studying his life.  He is considered the best intellectual among the Latter-day Saints.  This is a very high honor, considering that he had a bare-minimum education, and was illiterate for the first eight years of his life.  He was a self-made intellectual.  Why do we, who have so much, do so little?<br />The only drawback is that Elder Roberts relied on memory as he was dictating, so some of the dates aren't accurate.  Dr. Truman G. Madsen has written the definitive, and so far the only biography of B. H. Roberts called \\"Defender of the Faith: The B. H. Roberts Story,\\" which is a better book, since it fills in the gaps, rounds out the edges, and gets deeper into his philosophy.	2002-02-18

This book should really be called \\"The Power of Prayer\\" so the title is half misleading.  I say half, because prayer is a type of mental discipline, therefore, it is a special type of thinking, but not quite \\"positive thinking\\" per se.<br />This is a wonderful book on prayer, and you cannot fault anyone for trying to help other people draw closer to God, since that is what prayer is: speaking with the infinite.  Dr. Peale encourages intercessory prayers, that is, sending our prayers in behalf of other people, especially random prayers for people you don't know.<br />Being a very praxological-heavy book, the theology and orthodoxy comes in only to explain the proper practice. In other words, this book has strong legs and busy hands, and is a real \\"hand's on\\" book.  It tells you what you need to do to become better.  As I said earlier, prayer is a type of mental discipline thane involves control, focus, and a concern for other people and other things beside you.  And that is what good religion is all about: love for your neighbor.<br />The title has become a bit of a byword, but it is nice to see what Dr. Peal is really talking about.  It is not a mere chanmge of mind, or mental technique, but he is advocating a fuller life in Christ.  This is a very spiritual book, and not some pop-psychological mumbo jumbo.	2002-02-15

I am one of the few who thinks that this book is actually better than \\"Silence of the Lambs.\\"  And I won't say anything about \\"Hannibal.\\"  I think Harris has been stuck with a popular franchise, but couldn't find a direction that worked right.<br />But back to this book.  It is a very twisted story that has two villains gaining up on Graham, the killer known only as the  \\"Tooth Fairy\\" and the imprisoned Hannibal Lecter.  Meanwhile, Graham, who still bears emotional and mental scars from his first encounter from Lecter, decides to use him as a consulting psychologist.<br />So this book accentuates, in a better sense than \\"Silence of the Lambs,\\" the hazards of thinking like a criminal to understand him.  That is like asking the devil for directions out of Hell-you are not sure you are getting the straight truth.<br />Harris pulled a \\"Citizen Kane\\" with creating Hannibal Lecter, who was marvelously brought to life by Anthony Hopkins, although there are a few Brian Cox fans out there.  What bothers us about Hannibal Lecter is that we know that he knows what he his doing is wrong, and not only doesn't he care, but he thinks what he is doing is funny on a level.  Hence, the \\"tingling breast\\" reference in \\"Silence of the Lambs.\\"<br />This book lets you see another side of Hannibal Lecter, how, despite his incarceration, he was able to control and cannibalize the life of another man, Will Graham.  It is a different book than \\"Silence of the Lambs,\\" since it is a typical murder mystery, with two absolutely twisted villains, who are like Sith Lords, a master Hannibal and an apprentice Dollarhyde.

I must congratulate Dr. Zacharias for putting so much into this one small book.  I think the two cornerstones to this book are his faith, and his understanding of the basics of logic.<br />I say faith, because faith is a mode of epistemology, an way of understanding the world around us.  It is quite different than what we use in the Academy or in the world, but it is a way of knowing nonetheless.  It is a way of knowing by the heart, since the heat oftentimes tells you things that you mind doesn't know.<br />I say logic, in that he works with the fundamental Three Laws of Logic: Identity, Excluded Middle, and Non-Contradiction.  This is where most of the logical confusion and chaos erupts.  This is the rock-bottom of all logical discourse.  Using these three laws, Dr. Zachairas illustrates the absurdities (using this is the technical sense of an incoherency) of life without God.  (In fact, this book is a primer on logic, and clear thinking.  We are, after all, commanded to worship God not only with our hearts, but our minds.<br />This is not a math book, but a book of thought written on the freshman college level.  As always, ambitious people will always be rewarded. This book bridges the gap between the mind and the heart.  Dr. Zacharias is neither cold Spock nor wild McCoy, but he has channeled the synergy of both.<br />He nails, quite correctly I might add, that Nietzsche is the greatest modern philosopher.  More people believe (and prove it conclusively by their actions) that God is dead than believe that God is alive and active in our live.  Most people believe that God exists, but picture him a senile Santa Clause, or a vague historical personage as relevant as Amerigo Vespucci or Ferdinand Magellan.  The case the Christians make is that God is alive, active, and guiding us nowadays.<br />Dr. Zacharias asks the lynchpin question:  Why do antitheists believe in ethical codes that are not a direct outworking of their philosophy.  In other words, how do you get from \\"E=mc2\\" to \\"Love your Neighbor?\\"  I realize many antitheists have ethical codes, but why do these codes, in many instances, ape the religious ethical codes? Not to mention there is no Atonement and resurrection in antitheistic ethics, which atonement is the Central Christian Doctrine.<br />The only fault I would have with Dr. Zacharias is that he can be circumlocutious at times, but since he confesses that characteristically Eastern fault, we cannot hold it against him!<br />The appendices are quite helpful.

The Bible I use-King James Version, by the way--doesn't have an Apocrypha in it, so I decided to pick up this copy, partly because this edition was the KJV version, and partly because it matched the size of my Bible.  I'm in to the Bible so I am curious about anything and everything associated with the Book of Books.  I find the canonization process to absolutely fascinating.

It has an introductory essay and table of contents.  The footnotes are for alternate readings on the text, but do not cross-reference the text with the Apocrypha, or the Bible proper.  The printing is wonderful-I haven't found any typos, or faded text.  The versification is kept in the left margin, so the text is kept eye friendly, and the poetic portions are set apart as in the NIV.<br />I am surprised at the number of books included in the Apocrypha.  It is the \\"fattest\\" version I have seen that isn't a musty scholar's book.  It has the standard books, plus 3 and 4 Maccabees, Psalm 151, the prayer of Manassah, and two more books of Esdras.  I think this is all anyone could want in an Apocrypha.<br />For a more user-friendly version of the Apocrypha, would recommend the Godspeed Translation, which has a modern English style, along the lines of the J.

This is one of several books that attempt to get at the root texts of Joseph Smith.  We are in an unusual position with Joseph Smith: we have no autograph manuscripts of previous church leaders, such as Buddha, Moses, Mohamed, or Jesus Christ, but whit Joseph Smith, we have a tidal wave of primary documents that can be studied.<br />This book has the precious 1832 autograph history which has the second earliest version of the First Vision ever recorded, the earliest being D&amp;C 20:5.  It also has transcripts from his official journals.  It is wonderful to have this book of the real words of Joseph Smith.  The most surprising thing is to see that there was no monkey business going on with Joseph Smith's official history.<br />This edition is by Signature Books, which is a publishing house not friendly to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, which makes this book even more interesting.  The problem comes with the silent editing (p. xvii) that occurs with the book, especially with the disputed texts, such as the 27 July 1838 entry (see footnote p. 198), or the 26 September 1843 entry associated with the temple endowment, where the silent editing becomes rather loud.<br />The font is somewhat small, but it is quite readable, and this edition contains the manuscript strikeouts and misspellings, which impede reading a bit.  This book has great biographies on people mentioned in the journals, and has a superb index, and a chronological overview of Smith's life.  On the down side, there are no illustrations, except for the RLDS portrait of Joseph Smith.<br />This is a good one-volume alternative to the two-volume \\"Papers of Joseph Smith\\" published by Deseret Book, since it covers his entire life, stopping days before his assassination on 27 June 1844.	2002-02-13

He hadn't refined his ideas and smoother out his patter and phraseology.  But his ideas are there, and you cannot ignore a good argument. It is more of a hint of things to come, or a nest full of idea-eggs from which eagles are soon to hatch, fly and command the skies.<br />He focuses on Nietzsche, the real man of the 20th Century, since more people are overt or crypto-Nietzscheans than overt or crypto-Einsteinians.  If you read his works, such as \\"Anti-Christ,\\" \\"Twilight of the Gods,\\" or \\"Thus Spoke Zarathustra\\" you get a feel for the half-truths that Nietzsche espouses.  He discusses revaluing or transvaluing values, but what does that really mean?  Killing is OK? Peace is wrong?  But doesn't this topsy-turveyness describe the world we are in?<br />And vitriolic?  Dr. Zacharias is one of the meekest and gentlest humans around.  I have been cussed-out several times, and in several languages, and this book does not even enter the suburbs of anger and acid.  I think Dr. Zacharias's strength is his gentleness and soft touch in teaching theology.<br />Yes, this book is not Dr. Zacharias's strongest, but it is his first, and you get a feel for his arguments and reasons.

Dr. and Mrs. Andrus have compiled a wonderful book that has recollections about Joseph Smith from those that knew him.

These people remember things that Joseph Smith taught them.  One of the gems is Philo Dibble's account of Joseph Smith and Sydney Rigdon receiving the Vision of the Degrees of Glory.  Another is Parley P. Pratt's account of Joseph Smith rebuking the guards a Richmond Jail. If you heard a story that was attributed to Joseph Smith, but can't find in Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith, it is most likely here in this book.<br />The only complaint I have is that the Andrus's have missed some of Wilford Woodruff's recollections that are had in \\"Discourses of Wilford Woodruff.\\"	2002-02-13

There aren't any footnotes or an index, either.<br />On the nicer side, the cover is a nice fire engine red, and the printing is wonderful-I haven't found any typos, or faded text.  So this review isn't a complete slam.  Moreover, since I relish Shakespeare, I also have an affinity for the King James Translation.  It just seems authoritative, like when you read the Declaration of Independence or the Constitution!<br />For more user-friendly version of the Apocrypha, I would recommend the Godspeed Translation, which has a modern English style, along the lines of the J.

I beg to differ with most of the reviews.  I was enchanted with this book, and found Dr. Zacharias' insights into the eastern mind to be scintillating.  Of course, hailing from India, he has a special insight and affinity with many of these foreign religions.  I am in awe with India's religiousheterogeny!<br />I think practice of actually quoting from the Koran, as opposed to alluding to, paraphrasing from, or imagining what the book says, which is what so many people do nowadays.<br />Dr. Zacharias doesn't spend a lot of time outlining Christianity, since he presupposes a Christian reader. Moreover, he covered much of the uniqueness of Christ among false ideologies in \\"Can Man Live Without God,\\" and \\"A Shattered Visage.\\"  This book, therefore, should be read in context with his larger opus.<br />I think Dr. Zacharias has a very gentle voice and a steel mind, and that is what makes his books so enchanting.	2002-02-13

Bar none, this book is the single best volume for learning about the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints teaching on the Atonement of Jesus Christ.  It has an advantage over the more popular \\"Believing Christ,\\" because Dr. Millet spends more time getting into the exquisiteness of the Fall of Adam and Eve.  Steven Robinson vaguely alludes to the Fall in \\"Believing Christ,\\" although he has a chapter devoted to that pillar of eternity in \\"Following Christ,\\" the ugly stepsister of the two books.<br />I think that this book covers all of the topics, and has two chapters devoted to Justification and Sanctification, specifically naming these concepts, while Robinson only describes them.  I am not trying to pit the two books against each other, but I think that Dr, Millet has a more through explanation of the dynamics of Christ's mission vis-&agrave;-vis Adam's mission.<br />Several years ago, Elder McConkie spoke of the Three Pillars of Eternity, and chapter three of the Harold B. Lee manual picks up on the same concept, namely we need to understand Adam's role and mission before we can understand Christ's role and mission.  And Adam's mission as predicated upon the nature of the Creation.  See 1 Cor. 15:45-49; Mormon 9:11-13; 2 Nephi 2.  These Three Pillar of Creation, Fall, and Atonement are perfectly taught in the Endowment.<br />Dr. Millet picked up on these three pillars and writes a marvelous book getting into all the details of the Fall and the Atonement.  Indeed, it stands to reason that if the Atonement was infinite and eternal, that the fall must also be infinite and eternal, falling from an infinite and eternal creation.<br />I would recommend reading \\"Believing Christ,\\" and \\"Following Christ,\\" then reading \\"Within Reach,\\" then reading this book, to get everything in order.  Then go on to reading \\"Alive in Christ,\\" also by Dr. Millet, then Elder Bruce C. Hafen's The Trilogy of the Heart.  No scholar can say to another, \\"I have no need of thee.\\"	2002-02-11

Being a spiritual autobiography along the lines of C. S. Lewis's \\"Surprised by Joy,\\" or Bunyan's \\"Pilgrim's Progress,\\" it is a targeted story about one man's relationship with God.<br />I say surprisingly modern in that Augustine could make a frictionless slide into modern society.  As a youth, he was raised primarily by his spiritual mother, hung out in a gang called \\"The Wreckers,\\" spent all of his free time in the town square waiting the theatrical performances, and stole pears just for the buzz and the rush of doing it.<br />Well, this book is 1,500 years old, but you would never know it.  There is a case to be mad with what philosophers call \\"The Human Predicament,\\" which is the term used to describe the same ruts that humanity always seems to get in-war, death, poverty, corruption, secret combinations in government, an so forth.<br />However, Augustine's life illustrates what I would call the \\"The Solution to The Human Predicament.\\"  The answer lies not in looking left or right, or backwards or forwards, but in looking up.  If you are familiar with the bell curve-not the controversial book, but the scientific model used in statistics-you see that one-half, or 50% of the people you deal with are below average.  You can almost count off \\"one, two, one, two\\" as you ride on the bus, or drive on the highway.  And the rest of the three-quarters in a democracy will outvote the twenty-five percent of the people who are really smart.<br />So you see that Augustine had the answer to the problems we face.  Get God into your life.  You can see the outward effects of the internal conversion in Augustine.  Before he found God, he lifted pears just for kicks, after he found God, he received a pair of kicks that lifted him up, and changed his behavior.<br />This book is also important in another way.  Martin Luther was an Augustinian monk, and Augustine's conversion experiences were a pattern and prototype for Luther.<br />The translation is readable, and like always, Penguin has great notes that put the book in its proper context and in the context of the life of its author.readable, and like always, Penguin has great notes that put the book in its proper context and in the context of the life of its author.	2002-02-05

This book is a guide to symbolism written by the Rosicrucians (the Ancient Mystical Order Rosae Crucis ), which is an organization that as best I can tell has certain similarities to the Freemasons.  In any case, I found this book a rather fascinating study in primarily western symbols used by the Rosicrucian Order.<br />It has all of those wonderful quaint woodcuts from the 1600's and 1700's that catch the eye.  You see these types of symbols on the back of the US Dollar and on various buildings in Washington D.C., such as the all-seeing eye, the eagle, the phoenix, keys, and shields.  I found the chapter on various crosses to be mind whetting.  This book also covered some of the geometric symbols that are attributed to Ptolemy.  I believe there is a beauty in geometry that we have largely abandoned in our building, and this book can be a way to get that mathematical beauty back.<br />This book would be good for people who study ancient and medieval art forms, especially those interested in Cathedrals and temples.  In the Torah-the five books of Moses-the temple takes center life, so all things temple are of capitol importance.  Christians who have a type of \\"temple-envy\\" manifested in their cathedrals would find this book interesting, since Jesus Christ referred to the temple as his \\"Father's House.\\"	2002-02-05

The last Book of Mormon commentary war written in the late 1950's Elders George Reynolds and Janne Sjodahl, so it was about time that another Book of Mormon commentary was written, especially since President Ezra Taft Benson placed such a pointed emphasis on this Book of Books.<br />This commentary is also an improvement upon other books, since its focus is primarily upon doctrine, and not on archaeology or culture.  I think someone once referred this at to \\"likening the scriptures unto ourselves.\\"<br />The books contain both the text of the Book of Mormon, followed by the specific commentary.

The soft-back version of this book is a handy hand-held reference book. The format is topical, with several quotes elaborating on the various headings. It is a rather straightforward topical study of the gospel. Brother Burton rotates the speakers. So unlike &quot;Mormon Doctrine,&quot; the brainchild of Elder Bruce R. McConkie, it is not just one voice, but also many voices. He has quotes from all parts of this dispensation, and also includes citations from the scriptures, making the book complete and powerful.<br />Testimonial: A friend of mine who was a counselor at Especially For Youth (a youth summer camp like Vacation bible School), said that another one of the counselors used this book to help resolve the questions of one of the attendees. That makes it worth the bother of compiling and publishing.<br />This book is quite user friendly. I was really impressed with the cross-referencing of topics. The Savior &quot;expounded all the scriptures in one&quot; (3 Nephi 23:14), and this unity is key to understanding the gospel.  I have been using it a lot since becoming an instructor in my church's Elder's class.<br />The cover is nice and attractive. The marble pattern makes the book look like a bank: solid, authoritative and assuring. The printing quality is good: there is no fading and I have yet to find a typo.

It is not an official church publication, so the book has a lot of personality and bounce.<br />I though the chapter on his confirmation-hearing to be Solicitor General was quite interesting.  Remembering the Bork and Thomas hearings, these can be very bloody.  He was asked about any conflicts of interest between his church and his office as Solicitor General.  He said that he was an employee of the United States Government, so that is where his loyalty would lie.  He then made a comment that this question should have been settled with Kennedy.

Being written by the Prophet's son, this book has many of those humorous and deep insights that family members know, love, and cherish.  I think the most interesting inclusions is the copy of President Smith's second patriarchal blessing.  This blessing is a blessing for the world, since it gives us a revelation about the nature of President Smith's mission as an apostle, and later as a prophet.<br />President Joseph Fielding Smith is the reason why I am so religious. Or why I try to be religious, in any case.  He has one of the greatest theological minds that I have ever read, and he is like a modern Martin Luther.  He has a powerful faith that guided his life and labors.	2002-02-04

This is one of two versions of Elder B. H. Roberts' masterwork of theology.  The other edition being published by Brigham Young University Studies. I have both, so I will be comparing and contrasting them later in the review.<br />The story behind TWL is a little complex.  Elder Roberts (1857-1933) was a prolific writer, theologian, thinker and a scrapper. Near the end of his life he produced a manuscript called \\"The Truth, The Way, The Life,\\" which was to be a compact summation and extension of his theological thought.  The manuscript was reviewed by a blue-ribbon committee, but was never published by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints primarily for his advocacy of  \\"pre-Adamites,\\" and also speculation about God's progression in knowledge among other things.  In the late 1960's, President Hugh B. Brown photocopied the manuscript and gave it to one of his grandsons, Edwin B. Firmage, with the instruction to preserve the book.  Mr. Firmage donated the manuscript copy to the University of Utah, and then curator stand Larson decided to publish the book.<br />The copyright of the book, along with the three manuscripts of the book were owned by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, so it was thought that they could publish a joint version, but the talks broke down, so Larson published with Smith Research Associates, and BYU Studies published their own version, with photo-static reprints of the three manuscripts.<br />The book itself follows the outline set by the title: Truth, Way, Life.  Elder Roberts begins with a dissertation on the truth, and then goes into cosmology, with then-current (1925) science.  He relied heavily on Spencer's \\"First Principles\\" for much of his metaphysics.  He then discusses the nature of humanity, the Intelligences described in Latter-day Saint theology.  He has a section that surveys ancient religions, with special emphasis on the Hebrew Religion.  He concluded the first section with a discussion of creation.<br />The second section focuses on the Way.  It covers the creation of Man, the fall, and then the history of the earth from Adam to Christ.  The second half of the second section is a lengthy elaboration of Christ's atonement. This is probably the best part of the whole book; since the Atonement is the heart of Christian doctrine.<br />The Life is the third part of the book., and this section focuses on the \\"Sermon on the Mount,\\" and the Christian's character.  It concludes with a chapter on celestial, or eternal marriage, which is peculiar to the Church of Jesus Christ.<br />This book is really a condensed version of Elder Robert's \\"Seventies Course in Theology,\\" and frankly I prefer the \\"Seventies Course in theology\\" to this one-volume version simply because TWL lacks the depth and detail that \\"Seventies Course in Theology\\" has.  Roberts covered more ground and looked into the implication of things Mormon better than he did in the TWL.  The only advantage TWL has is that it is more streamlined, focused, and refined in many areas.<br />Looking over the book, I really wish that Elder Roberts has acquiesced on the Pre-Adamites, and Progressing God issues.  Except for these one or two things (in addition to the outdated science and metaphysics), it is a good book, and the chapters on the Atonement (which are word for word from the \\"Seventies Course in Theology\\") are superb.  In fact, I think that the controversial chapters-and the controversy itself-- have eclipsed what was good with the manuscript.<br />One thing that Elder Roberts missed was elucidation upon \\"Eternalism.\\"  He devoted a chapter to Eternalism in his \\"Seventies Course in theology,\\" be he overlooked this rater fascinating concept in this book.  This striking doctrine is unique to the theology of the Saints and deserves a place in this book.<br />Regarding the two editions, the Larson edition is, bar far, the more readable version of the two, and follows closer to the pattern Elder Roberts used in his \\"Seventies Course in Theology.\\"  Moreover, it is in soft back, so the book is cheaper.  This edition has commentary by Leonard Arrington and Sterling McMurrin, two staunch Mormon intellectuals, and fans of Elder Robert's work.  I would recommend this edition to anyone with a passing curiosity of the book, the subject or the man B. H. Roberts.<br />However, the BYU Studies version has the better commentary, with articles written by Truman Madsen, David Paulsen, Andrew Skinner, and James Allen.  Plus, this edition has the better index and helps at the end of the book, with a summery of Joseph Fielding Smith's arguments against evolution and pre-Adamites.  Plus, this edition has an extension to chapter 31, which chapter was read to the Quorum of the Twelve, which rounds out Roberts arguments for pre-Adamites.  This edition is less readable, with many strikeouts and spelling corrections.  These are absolutely unnecessary for the layman and get in the way of getting Robert's ideas.  For the very curious, I recommend the BYU Studies edition.<br />This is a good book in certain areas, but both editions suffer from having too much useless information.  I would suggest a streamlined, layman version that combines the best of both editions.  It would have the Larsen edition's format, which follows the \\"Seventies Course in Theology\\" with the chapter outlines and introductions, and I would not have any strikeouts in the text, and use the Larson diagrams.  Just edit it as you would a normal book.  I would use the BYU Edition's chapter summery in the table of contents, use its better index, scripture citations, and not worry about the minor variant readings. Follow the Larsen's edition of having \\"A Modification of the Orthodox View\\" back in controversial Chapter 31, and integrate the variant introduction the BYU Edition has in the appendix into one introduction.  Also have the additional material in the BYU Edition that was appended to Chapter 31 (p. 318-322) put in as an appendix to that chapter.

But then again, almost all of the books on this website are not official publications of the Church of Jesu Christ of Latter-day Saints. Neither are \\"Doctrines of Salvation,\\" \\"Believing Christ,\\" \\"The Work and Glory,\\" nor the telephone book. Most of the books I own are not official publications of the Church, but that does not make them any less valuable, useful, or truthful!<br />By the way, &quot;Standing for something&quot; is published by Times books, not the Church.<br />This encyclopedia is one of the greatest sources of information about what we believe. I feel that it is essential to look at the sources that Elder McConkie uses: the scriptures, JST, Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith, and the writings of other prophets. The key is not to look past, but through Elder McConkie and see the foundation upon which he builds.<br />This book is an encyclopedia format; so like the dictionary, it has no plot, just reference entries! It covers many subjects, and provides scriptures to reinforce Elder McConkie's analysis. It is interesting to see how far and wide the Restoration goes, and the endless variety of subjects that are embraces within the Gospel!<br />This is a handy one-volume book for people wanting an introduction to the Gospel, but can't afford the Encyclopedia of Mormonism.<br />The main problem with Mormon Doctrine, and everything else Elder McConkie writes, is that many people talked about Elder McConkie, but few ever read or understand Elder McConkie! Hopefully we will read with a careful eye this book.<br />I also find it rather unusual that some people won't forgive Elder McConkie for making one mistake in doctrine.  Is he beyond God's redeeming grace?	2002-02-02

This book is a melding of the minds, hearts, and lives of two of the most influential members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.  Lorenzo Snow was the fifth president of the Church of Jesus Christ, and was a spiritual titan. He had great testimony of God, and a keen insight into humanities eternal potential. But I think that his most endearing quality is his face.  He ahs a holy face that has been worn and wrinkles as he wore out and wrinkled his life in the service of God.<br />His biographer was his sister Eliza Snow, who deserves-and has-several biographies of her own.  She was poet by temperament and talent, so the prose flows.  Moreover, she has great sisterly insight into the work and osul of the man who was a prophet and also her brother.<br />This classic volume covers Lorenzo Snows exciting life, from his first contact with Joseph smith in Kirtland, OH, his journey with the saints across the plains, and to his missionary labors in England and Italy.  There is considerable attention paid to Snow's work with the United Order in Brigham City.<br />I have no complaints, and only praise for this book. The cover suggests the majesty of its contents, and I am glad that I bought and read this book.  It is a mind-edifier and a heart warmer.	2002-02-01

Having a background (i.e. a BA) in history, I was reading it as an historical text, and not a guide as to how to run a business.  However, since a hammer can crack a coconut as well as drive nails, I think I will progress.  Secondly, and separately, there is an old adage that says, \\"Plato is easier to understand than the Platonists,\\" which illustrates the idea that these old texts, unlike the commentators on the texts, are not mysterious or esoteric, but quite easy to understand.<br />I think out the outset, an understanding of \\"TAO,\\" and its supplementary doctrine of \\"mandate of heaven\\" need to be clarified.  \\"Tao,\\" in a word means the \\"Way,\\" or the proper course of things.  It is roughly equivalent to the Greek \\"Zoe,\\" which means the correct and proper lifestyle.  The idea is living one's life in accordance to the morality of the universe.  In the Anglo-Saxon tradition we call this \\"Natural Law.\\"  The idea of \\"Tao,\\" and all of these, is to bring one in accordance, or \\"at one,\\" with the moral force of the universe.<br />That \\"at-one-ment\\" with the universal morality is the key to a leader's power, whereby he would have \\"the mandate of heaven.\\"  This is the Asian equivalent of \\"the divine right of kings.\\"  The idea was in doing the proper thing in the proper to achieve success.<br />Sun-tzu's philosophy is supple.  As a contrast, Sun-tzu is the exact opposite of General William Tecumseh Sherman.  Sun-tzu embodies that Asian patience and restraint that we all admire, while Sherman was more or less a Rambo on speed.  It is, odd, therefore that so many business men would find the good Chinese general's philosophy so appealing, since it runs counter to current cooperate culture-back stabbing, \\"more, more-faster, faster!,\\" and human sacrifices to the Almighty Dollar.  If this book can restrain some of the out of control Enron greed, then it is worth the trouble of reading.<br />If anything, this book is novel in that it provides a \\"softer\\" approach to war, or anything else.  Sun-tzu advocates strategy, disinformation as a tool, and the rather novel idea that you use an army as a last resort. But if the army is to be use, fight the battle quickly, severely, and with full force.  This is a lesson I hope the Department of Defense is heeding, since in our current war on terrorism, the world is in the balance.<br />This translation is readable, and it includes the ancient commentaries on Sun-tzu's work, since I think it is crucial that we understand the work as the ancients understood things. C. S. Lewis in his book \\"God in the Dock,\\" has an essay entitled \\"On Reading Old Books,\\" where he points out that each age has its own assumptions and presuppositions about things, and that it is in the area of these assumptions that the real intellectual work takes place.<br />The introductory chapters are priceless, and put the book in its historical context-past, present, and future.  The section on Mao's and the Soviet's use of this book was quite interesting.  This edition also has Wu chi's \\"Art of War,\\" which is more of a Taoist approach to war, and includes religious practices, such as divining.  It provides an excellent counterpoint to Sun-tzu's work.<br />I would recommend reading this book with Lao-tze's \\"Tao Te Ching,\\" Confucius's \\"Analects,\\" and Machiavelli's \\"The Prince.\\"  The first two books help round out Asian culture, religion, and philosophy that are indispensable for getting the subtleties and details of  \\"The Art of War.\\" \\"The Prince\\" is included, because fighting a war and maintaining a state are two totally different projects.  Take Alexander the Great as the greatest example: he conquered the land from Macedonia to India, but after his death, his empire split into three kingdoms.  Machiavelli illustrates some techniques for maintaining a state.  Actually, for a really interesting book on success, and how to be successful AND moral, I would recommend the humble \\"Book of Proverbs\\" conveniently found in you Bible.  Proverbs is ancient wisdom, like \\"Art of War,\\" or Tao Te Ching,\\" but we frequently for get it, since familiarity breeds contempt!<br />In the final analysis, a book is only good insofar as it opens up your mind and causes you to reevaluate things, which this book does.veniently found in you Bible.

This isn't an eye-opening book per se, since we could piece the ideas in the book by merely reading the newspaper and the Bible.  However, the power of this book comes from its historical context, its analysis, and finally the proscriptions Bork offers.<br />Bork spend the first several chapters tracing the history of modern Liberalism. I think his insights on the Korean and Vietnam War were fascinating.  He did miss one observation, namely during WWII we had many celebrity joined the cause, notably Jimmy Stewart.  I think that Elvis was the last famous person to be drafted.  I believe in the power of example, and the good power of a good example.<br />Bork, despite what you think of his stance on abortion or chain smoking, is an analytical genius.  He isn't on the level of an Aquinas, but he is certainly in the top 10% of living human computers.  He covers the current hot button issues (remember what I said about the newspaper and the Bible), such as race relations, feminism, religious liberalism, and so forth.<br />The strength, and the weakness of this analysis, is that Bork takes a legal perspective.  His most controversial suggestion is having a congressional override of Supreme Court decisions (p. 117-119). He had in mind Roe V. Wade, but other decisions as well, such as affirmative action, or Church and State issues.<br />One of the problems that Bork has is that he relies only on legal solutions.  Structure can only go so far in solving problems.  And in the future, such a legal structure could work against conservative.  I am not knocking the idea, but what I am saying is that this solution would have to be just one arrow in the quiver.  I think that another arrow would have to be a solidifying of the moral base.  This would have to be done in the Churches and in the schools.  We have a toehold now since many schools now have character education as part of the curricula.  Why it was ever taken out is a mystery to me, since Congress said, \\"Religion, morality, and knowledge, being necessary to good government and the happiness of mankind, schools and the means of education shall forever be encouraged.\\" (Northwest Ordinance, Article 3).<br />Bork observed that morality needs to be renewed with each generation (p. 275), and the basic structures for teaching morality, the family, the church, and the schools have failed at living up to their charge.<br />That last area that Bork covers is proscription. He suggests that the current trends can be reversed by four trends: a religious revival, a revival of public discourse about morality a cataclysmic war, or a deep economic recession (p. 336).  As of the writing of this review, Feb 1, 2002, we have three of these four-the discourse on morals, the war, and the recession. The next question is, \\"Are these three severe enough to reverse the trends?\\"<br />Pat Buchanan in \\"Death of the West,\\" Richard Swinson in \\"Hurtling Towards Oblivion,\\" Aldous Huxley \\"Brave New World/Brave New World Revisited,\\" and George Orwell, \\"1984\\" and \\"Animal Farm,\\" say no.

And if they are not, then at least we can soften the blow when \\"Doomsday\\" finally comes.  In any cas4e, this question of doomsday has taken on a new meaning and urgency since the fall of the Soft Union in 1989.

I almost shouldn't write this review since we all know about the book and what it says. In fact, the title has become proverbial, and has been ripped-off many times. And Dr. Covey's son's book \\"Seven Habits of Highly Effective Teens\\" has been parodied on the Simpsons (episode AABF22), which is the best compliment that can be paid to anything.<br />This book is any easy read, and I recommend that the younger the reader, the better it will be for them and everyone.  There is no mumbo-jumbo, and if a child can work his way through \\"Alice in Wonderland,\\" then he or she would be ready for this book.  It is easier to learn while young, since you have the years of keeping up the habit working for you.  Lenin said that if you give him a child, he would make a Bolshevik for life.  That truth also works in the opposite direction. Raise a youth in the truth, and he will be true his entire life.<br />I think several things set this book apart from other self-help books.  First, this book had a strong spiritual under-grindings. Every page bleeds light. I think this spiritual aspect comes from Dr. Covey's Christian faith, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.  This faith keeps him from falling into intimidation or other superficial \\"techniques\\" of getting things done.  Covey advocates a total overhaul of the soul in order to get your life into order.  Christianity advocates repentance, which is merely change for the better, and Cover advocates a type of Business Management repentance.<br />Secondly, Covey has a circular system.  You have seen that \\"hourglass in a circle\\" diagram that is the visual depiction of Covey's philosophy.  In a word, I would say that Covey's philosophy embraces a type of a circular renewal with progressive.  For whatever reason, Western thought embraces a linear progression, while Eastern thought is circular.  The Jews have managed to bridge the gap between the two, with linear progression from Creation to Abraham to Moses, while maintaining the circularity with the Holy Days at the temple.  Cove describes this process of combining the circular with the progressive in his \\"upward spiral\\" diagram.  C. S.  Lewis described in chapter 25 of \\"The Screwtape Letters,\\" that the progressive coupled with the circular as a type of divine genius.  You have the novelty of progress coupled with assurance of habit.<br />Thirdly, Covey focuses on habits.  He wants all of these principles to become engrained by force of repetition. This idea goes back to Aristotle, and was elucidated by Thomas Aquinas.  However, all philosophical ramblings and mumbo-jumbo aside, this idea of habits is common-sensical. Habit is a force of will, and is the way we do things such as memorize phone numbers or passwords.  We can do the same thing with good habits. We complain about bad habits, but with a little effort, we can replace bad habits with good habits.  The ancients understood this, but wee have seem to forgotten this in our pseudo-sophistication.  After all, Socrates without an Internet was smarter than most people alive, with digitized libraries at their fingertips.<br />There are other aspects to Covey philosophy, but I think that these three points cover some of the unique ground.  Personally, I hate motivational speakers-Chris Farley was the best!  They focus on emotional siren songs that ultimately have no long-term power.

To begin with, I believe than any book, even a bad book, has some useful truth that will benefit anyone.  However, this book is a good book, despite its rater offish title.  For non-Christians  &#8220;Babylon&#8221; is a Biblical term for worldliness and all things evil.  But that one objection aside, I think that this book on finances is useful for anyone.<br />This book is written in a pseudo-scripture, or pseudo-ancient text approach that Nietzsche used in  &#8220;Thus Spoke Zarathustra.&#8221;  The benefit of this approach is that it gives the truths an air of mystique, so you pay attention.  Clason even uses some of the awkward Elizabethan phrase constructions and Hebraisms found in the King James Version of the Bible.  SO expect the reading to be a little different than say, Idiots guide to personal Finances, or the Motley Fool money guides.  But if you can get caught up in the mystique and mythic feel of the book, then you can go ahead.<br />Yes, this book covers a lot of basics that may be common sense to some people.  But our economic education in this country is substandard that some people do not even know the basics.  Shakespeare pointed out in Sonnet 66 that simple truth at times is miscalled simplicity, and I hope the simple truths in this book are not overlooked because they may be basic.  Indeed this book is a primer on basic personal economics&#8212;say Economics 99.  But you need to start somewhere, and this book provides a basic plan for anyone new to managing money correctly.<br />There are some pieces missing, such as resisting the temptation to buy on credit, or worldliness in general, or how to invest wisely in the stock market, but the basics are covered here.<br />Get this book for your teenagers, and have them memorize the seven &#8220;Rules of Acquisition&#8221; on the fly page.  Then have them outline every chapter, to engrain the principles in your heart and minds.

This book's title has become proverbial, and I am glad for that recognition. You just need to look at the world around you to see the necessity of books like this.  We have become moral imbeciles.  Some people can't tell the difference between their right had and left hand, speaking poetically.<br />Many people criticize this book as being too simplistic. That is an odd criticism.  Not that this book is wrong, or factually in error.  Even the accusation of impracticality would be a substantive point. But being too simplistic?  Shakespeare wisely observed that simple truth is oftentimes miscalled simplicity (Sonnet 66).  The accusation of being simplistic doesn't even rise to the dignity of a non-issue.<br />This book is a collection of moral stories and precepts that serve to supplement and buttress peoples moral sense, which is our conscience, or the spark within that tells us to do good.  In the Apology, Socrates said that he had this spirit, which guided him.  We all have something like this, and truthful books like this help refine this sense of right and wrong.  Just look at the fallen towers to see the need for books like this.<br />Another accusation is that we can't turn back the clock.  Well, if the clock is broken, then you are morally obligated to turn back the clock.  By the way, are you giving you consent to the current state of things?  It seems that we have made complaining a virtue. But it is complaining without corresponding action, which results mere noise pollution.<br />We have to do something to change things, and Bill Bennett has done his part in compiling this book, which is an easy read.  This is a thick book, but each one of the chapters is small.  It seems to have been geared towards first and second graders, but anyone can benefit from reading the truth.  Truth shines in the eyes of the readers.	2002-02-01

The trail diary covers Eliza&#8217;s 111-day pioneer journey across the plains.  It records some of the experiences she had along the way, not only being a ministering angel to the sick sisters, but several profound spiritual experiences she had.<br />This book is a must for anyone into the original documents.  The only problem I have is the price.  I thought that University Presses were supposed to provide cheap books!  Sheesh!<br />Eliza Roxcy Snow Smith was a Wonder Woman.  She is one of the greatest women, no only in Momondom, but in American history, and even the world.  He greatness is due to her unusual talents.  She is an incredible poet, but an incredible woman to boot.

Talmage makes a survey of the Latter-day Saint view of the Great Apostasy.  Many, in fact all western churches recognize that there was a falling-away from what Jesus Christ taught.  The idea of an apostasy was the basis for the Protestant Reformation.  Luther recognized that something was not quite right with the Universal Church, so his attempts at reformation indicate that the church had been changed from its original character.  And the Roman Catholic Counter-Reformation is a tacit compliment and tacit consent to the notion of a falling away.  The Great Schism (AD 1054) shows that the Eastern and western Churches thought that the other branch had become corrupt. By the way, the Koran mentions that some of the Christian practices, such as adoration of Mary (Surah 5:116, 9:31), and the resurrection (Surah 4:157), and Jesus&#8217; divine nature (Surah 5:72, 6:101) were wrong, so Mohammed may in fact be the first Reformer!<br />Soren Kierkegaard said, &#8220;O Luther, you had 95 theses . . . The matter is far more terrible&#8212;there is only one thesis.  The Christianity of the New Testament does not exist at all.  Here there is nothing to reform.&#8221; (The Essential Kierkegaard, 428)  Furthermore, Mr. K always laments that he is one without authority to be a preacher, although he does it anyways, calling himself a poet instead of an apostle. (The Essential Kierkegaard, p. 84, 267-68, 385, 450, 454)<br />So, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is not a lone voice, but part of a chorus.<br />In this book, Elder Talmage covers the external and the internal causes of the falling away from the Church and Gospel that Jesus Christ established.  External causes are the Jewish persecution and the Pagan persecution, and internal causes being the inclusion of worldly philosophies in the doctrines, the change in the sacraments (ordinances) of the Church, and the change in church government and organization. He then brings us through the Apostasy to the Restoration in the 1800&#8217;s by Joseph Smith.<br />Elder Talmage uses his rather sesquipedalian style keeps you going for the dictionary, and can, at times, be a thick steak to chew on.  However, the book has slim chapters, and is well organized, so you can get back on track quickly.  The only complaint I would have is that it would be nice to have some illustrations and pictures.<br />As I said, this is nothing new, since all Christian denominations believe that something happened to the Church between the end of the Book of Revelation and now.  The pressing question, however, is not &#8220;Did it happen?&#8221; but  &#8220;What are we now to do?&#8221;  Elder Talmage expresses his faith&#8212;and mine also&#8212;that there needed to be a restoration of everything that was lost, and that Joseph Smith was called to be the prophet that resorted Christ&#8217;s Church.  &#8220;New wine in old bottles . . .&#8221;<br />As with all books, you need to read it to understand it.o the Restoration in the 1800&#8217;s by Joseph Smith.<br />Elder Talmage uses his rather sesquipedalian style keeps you going for the dictionary, and can, at times, be a thick steak to chew on.

This is more of a testimonial than a review.<br />I was trapped by the title, so I bought the book, and took the survey on pages xxi-xxii, and got 18 out of the 23 right-a 79%!  So knew this book was for me!<br />I admire Dr.Aron's courage in writing this book, since, as she says in the introduction, that people who are highly sensitive are not the kind to be pushy about what happens to them, so she was really working against the grain to get this book published.<br />Growing up, I was always bothered by loud noises, and had trouble sleeping, since the street noises, the dim but ambient light in the room, and jets flying overhead kept me up.  Also my mind refused to stop working, so I had a hard time sleeping and would always get up early in the morning, being overwhelmed by the world around me.  I always felt that something wasn't quite right, but I couldn't put a finger on it, or vocalize my concerns since those of my family didn't have the same symptoms that I had.  Every time I would bring up something, I was called a liar, or accused of \\"faking it.\\"<br />I think part of my case was biological, since I have severe allergies to dust mites, and am asthmatic, which has caused me to put on a lot of weight.  Then factor in the psychology of this all, and you see what a fix I am in.<br />On the good side, I think I have always been able to enjoy music better than other people.  Being highly sensitive means that I am not filtering out as much stimulation as other people.  So I wouldn't do well at a rock concert, but in a more controlled setting, I can hear and perceive more in the music than most people.  Ditto for smell and taste.  If you have ever seen the TV show \\"The Sentinel,\\" you get the idea.  For those out of the loop, \\"The Sentinel\\" is soft-core sci-fi show about a cop how has heightened senses-hearting, sight, and whatnot--and uses these abilities to solve crimes.  The sad thing is that a person with heightened sense would be overwhelmed by this noisy world of ours.<br />This book by Dr. Aron is not just a feel-good book, although I am always content to rejoice in the truth, but it gives practical solutions to dealing with hypersensitivity.  She encourages you to take breaks from stimulating activities, and to do things slowly.  Don't compare yourself to other people who have duller senses, but do things on your own.  This will cause you to be separated from other people, but pretend you are a monk on retreat.<br />I recommend this book for anyone who feels overwhelmed by the stimulation round him or her!f ours. <br />This book by Dr. Aron is not just a feel-good book, although I am always content to rejoice in the truth, but it gives practical solutions to dealing with hypersensitivity.

He is able the bridge the gap between the head and the heart, something that both Casanova and Mr. Spock could never do!<br />This books focuses on the problem of pain, so it should be read in conjunction with C. S. Lewis&#8217; book of the same name.  I think Dr. Z&#8217;s most profound (and lacerating) question in this book is &#8220;If it is right, why do I feel so bad?&#8221;  We know we are supposed to do things that are right, but we always get flack or into deeper trouble for doing them.  I think the saw is &#8220;No good deed goes unpunished,&#8221; and Dr. Z tackles this problem head on!<br />He spends time dealing with Job as a test case, and devotes an appendix to dealing with problem of pain.<br />Personally, and all pretences of scholastic impartiality aside, I found this book helpful.  In a deep philosophical sense, we have to have evil, at least potentially, to make sense of life.  In my own religious tradition, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, it is written in the Book of Mormon: Another Testament of Jesus Christ, that<br />&#8220; For it must needs be, that there is an opposition in all things. If not so . . . righteousness could not be brought to pass, neither wickedness, neither holiness nor misery, neither good nor bad. Wherefore, all things must needs be a compound in one; wherefore, if it should be one body it must needs remain as dead, having no life neither death, nor corruption nor incorruption, happiness nor misery, neither sense nor insensibility.  Wherefore, it must needs have been created for a thing of naught; wherefore there would have been no purpose in the end of its creation. Wherefore, this thing must needs destroy the wisdom of God and his eternal purposes, and also the power, and the mercy, and the justice of God.&#8221; (2 Nephi 2:11-12)<br />The strength of character comes from going upstream, against to flow.  Look at Buddah&#8212;he was living a posh lifestyle, but he gave it up, since there was no opposition in his life.  His life only became meaningful once he was placed in the realm of choice.<br /> It is true that Christianity has become counter-culture.

I include irreligious, atheists, and antitheists as being faithful since it has been my experience that unbelief takes as much work as belief.  You must close your eves to a lot of truth and say that the sun isn't shining at noon in July, which requires as much work as saying God lives in the face of the 9-11 Attacks, or famine, or dying babies.  Indeed, C. S. Lewis observed, \\"A young man who wishes to remain a sound Atheist cannot be too careful in his reading.  There are traps everywhere.\\" (Surprised by Joy, ch.12)<br />In the Lectures on Faith, Joseph Smith records seven lessons that the early leaders of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints were taught in the Temple at Kirtland.  These lessons are a peek into Joseph Smith's mind and reveal his rather extensive understanding of faith.<br />The Lectures are seven and follow this outline:<br />Lecture 1: The nature of faith is discussed.  It is a principle of action and a principle of power in the temporal and in the spiritual realm.  In fact, \\"power\\" is a perfect synonym for faith.  In its most unlimited sense, \\"faith then, is the first great governing principle which has power, dominion, and authority over all things; by it they exist, by it they are upheld, by it they are changed, or by it they remain, agreeable to the will of God.\\"<br />Lecture 2:  This lecture show the object upon with our faith exists.  Our faith is based on God; and our knowledge of God is reducible to Adam's testimony as recorded in the Bible.  Joseph Smith does a complex and sometimes tedious proof to show the internal consistency of the Bible, and that we have an unbroken chain of testimony from Adam to Abraham.  In addition to the Adamic testimony, we can get our own person experiences with God, like Abraham, Moses or the Brother of Jared in the Book of Mormon: Another Testament of Jesus Christ.<br />Lecture 3: Discusses the character of God. Now that we know that God exists, we need to know what type of God we are dealing with, and have a correct understanding of God.  The seven key characteristics are:<br />First, that he was God before the world was created, and the same God that he was after it was created.<br />Second, that he is merciful and gracious, slow to anger, abundant in goodness, and that he was so from everlasting, and will be to everlasting.<br />Third, that he changes not, neither is there variableness with him; but that he is the same from everlasting to everlasting, being the same yesterday today and forever; and that his course is one eternal round, without variation.<br />Fourth, that he is a God of truth and cannot lie.<br />Fifth, that he is no respecter of persons, but in every nation he that fears God and works righteousness is accepted of him.<br />Sixth, that he is love.<br /> Lecture 4: Discusses the attributes of God. These help clarify the correct nature of God.  The seven key attributes are: Knowledge; Faith or Power; Justice; Judgment; Mercy; and Truth.<br />Lecture 5: Continues the discussion on the correct nature of God, and focuses on the nature of the Godhead, and each person's relationship to the members of the Godhead.  This lecture is one of the best lectures on theology out there.  The focus is on getting \\"the mind of Christ,\\" which is another way of saying getting the Holy Ghost in our lives.<br />Lecture 6: Discusses the nature of sacrifice, and how sacrifice is necessary to know God and to have faith, Abraham being the example. \\"Let us here observe, that a religion that does not require the sacrifice of all things, never has power sufficient to produce the faith necessary unto life and salvation.\\"<br />Lecture 7: This lecture covers the effects that flow from faith, being namely Salvation.  When we work by faith [see 1Thess. 1:3; 2 Thess. 1:11], we work bymental exertion, and we work by words, not physical labors.  We become more like god, and soon become \\"assimilated\\" into the likeness of God.  So, then, salvation is the product of faith.<br />I think I have given away half of the book!  But buy the book and get some flesh on this skeleton-outline!<br />Shakespeare observed that brevity was the soul of wit (Hamlet), and that simplicity was oftentimes miscalled simple (Sonnet 66).  These lectures are quite easy to follow, but the older I get, the more profound they become.

A child can tell you the truth, in child-like language, while falsehood requires the lawyer and the priest to tell it to make it at all plausible; it requires a scholastic education to make falsehood pass for truth.\\" Brigham Young, Discourses of Brigham Young, p.330 - p.331.<br />This is an arresting book. In simple and plain language, Dr. Swensen makes the case that we are heading towards disaster. He proves his point in ten chapters and 139 pages, so this is not complex, overwhelming or mysterious. And, although the good doctor IS a Christian, there is no theological jargon or spiritual cant and mumble here. The only idea that is religious per ser is the falleness factor discussed in chapter Five. But you don't need to believe in the Bible to realize that things go wrong. You just need to believe in Murphy's Law and the Second Law of Thermodynamics-entropy.<br />So what is Dr. Swensen's point? His is a voice of warning that several factors or tends are working together to cause serious havoc on the world-system. These trends are:<br />1) PROFUSION: More and more of everything. And he means EVERYTHING!<br />2) IRREVERSABILITY: We cannot undo what we have done-you can't unscramble eggs.<br />3) EXPONENTIAL GROWTH: This more and more of everything is happening faster and faster, so we are getting more and more of the original \\"more and more.\\" This is on an exponential J-curve.<br />4) FALLENESS FACTOR: Things go wrong, or can be misused.<br />5) With all of these factors working together, we not only have a profusion of good (i.e. More educated people, more TVs and CT-scan machines), but he also have an EXPONENTIAL PROFUSIONOF EVIL<br />6) At some point this EXPONTIAL PROFUSION OF EVIL can overwhelm the world.<br />Sobering. Quite sobering. But this is not a \\"date setting\\" book for doomsday, nor is it a pessimistic book. It is a voice of warning about the process that may lead to doomsday.<br />Dr. Swenson takes the stand that this process is irreversible. That is an interesting debate. As a human I have hope, and as a Christian I believe in repentance, but many voices disagree with me. Pat Buchanan in his book \\"The Death of the West,\\" agrees with Dr. Swenson that these trends are irreversible, although Toffler in \\"The Third Wave\\" says, though the trends unstoppable, we can survive.<br />On the other hand, other men say that we can change this Armageddon process. C. S. Lewis speaks of a type of scientific repentance in \\"Abolition of Man.\\" Robert Bork speculates in \\"Slouching towards Gomorrah\\" that a religious revival, more public discourse on morals, a cataclysmic war, or a sever depression may reverse trends. .

Dr. Peter Kreeft advocates Charity--AGAPE--the Pure Love of Christ should be our weapon against the culture.<br />FYI, Unabomber Ted Kazcinski in his manifesto advocated terrorism against the means of industry-basically wholesale luddite-ism.

Though it wasn't Spain, I still felt the same breeze, and saw the same type of windmills that Quixote tilted in his tilted reason.<br />Joseph Smith once observed that, \\"by proving contraries, truth is made manifest,\\" (History of the Church 6:428), and Aristotle once said that if you want to find truth, invert.  Cervantes follows this pattern of putting things upside-down to show right-side-upness.  He accentuates reality by taking an insane man as his lead character.  The paradox, however, is that Quixote seems to be the sanest person in the story.<br />\\"The Man of La Mancha\\" has two advantages over its parent-text \\"Don Quixote.\\"  The first is that Wasserman, et al. did a marvelous job of pairing down Cervantes' two part book into a one act play.  A lot of Quixote's adventures are funny parody, but it at times becomes a bit over-done.  The play captures the essence of the Quixote-Idea without any gas. \\"Brevity is the soul of wit,\\" as Shakespeare testified.<br />The second advantage is the music.  \\"The Quest (The Impossible Dream)\\" is a triumph not only for Wasserman et al, but it is a triumph for humanity.  So this book needs to be read with the soundtrack.  The original Broadway is my favorite, since it captures the Iberian wind that blows over the story.  The Peter O'Toole film is too produced and had too many sweet strings that drench out the Spanish guitars.<br />You know how good a work of art is by seeing how it is parodies.  Quixote has been copied on \\"Quantum Leap,\\" and Alf, and Jim Neighbors sung \\"The Quest\\" on Gomer Pyle.  There is even a cartoon \\"Don Coyote and Sancho Panda.\\"  And, of course, there is the classic Mr. Magoo (Jim Baccus) version of Don Quixote.<br />So buy, and enjoy this play.  Read along with the movie, and ponder reality through the eyes of an insane man.an.	2002-01-22

If their system could be of any utility to man, it would seem to be by giving him a modest opinion of himself, but these reasoners show that it is not so; and when they think they have said enough to prove that they are brutes, they appear as proud as if they had demonstrated that they are gods.\\" Alexis de Toqueville, Democracy in America, Book I, chp. 15<br />This is a gripping book.  The deepest cuts always come from the sharpest knives, and Squire Johnson's blade is true.<br />I think the most important thing I gleaned from the books was an appreciation for the unquestioned assumptions we have.  Fro example, we in the west believe that we are separate and individual entities, but in eastern thought, there is the principle of \\"moksha,\\" where you undergo an epiphany and realize that all things are manifestations of a great cosmic one.  The problems with that, is that, theoretically, since my neighbor and I are one, then I can conceivably be punished for my neighbor's crimes.<br />Johnson discusses two concepts: evolution as a type of metaphysical assumption, and the impact of this evolutionary assumption on education and law.  I found it absolutely flabbergasting that Johnson asked if evolution was true, and the professor looked at him dumbfounded.<br />Part of the appeal of Evolution and Naturalism is the label of \\"science,\\" which is a powerful hallmark and seal-look at attempts at \\"Cliometrics\\" in history.  But labeling something as \\"scientific\\" doesn't make it \\"scientific,\\" and secondly, not everything that isn't labeled \\"science\\" is useless.  Love, as many poets have pointed out, is quite unscientific, computer dating services notwithstanding.  But, as Thomas Sowell pointed out in \\"Vision of the Anointed,\\" \\"One of the most common benedictions of the anointed is in the use of the word `science' to describe notions which are consistent with their vision, but which neither have the certainty not the intellectual rigor of science. . . . . The most important characteristic of science-empirical verification-is often omitted entirely by those with the vision of the anointed. Indeed, much of their verbal dexterity goes into evading empirical evidence. The crowing irony is that no empirical data are collected or sought as to how these `scientists' are wrong.\\" (p. 214-215)<br />It seems more like a type of posturing than producing data.  The reason why this goes on is that the ideas have consequences, and what we believe determines what we do.  Which brings me to methodological and metaphysical naturalism.  Plain and simple, metaphysical materialism is the reason why we have methodological materialism.  You can be a methodological materialism, but lurking in the background is the idea of metaphysical materialism, since the methodology assumes the metaphysics.  This presupposition about metaphysics, regardless if you believe it or not, influences your interpretation of the data.<br />This book is an easy read, since Johnson has smooth prose. It is geared for college level, but anyone ambition can tackle it, since there is no technical-eese.istent with their vision, but which neither have the certainty not the intellectual rigor of science. . . . .

Brigham Young once observed that \\"We should not only study good, and its effects upon our race, but also evil, and its consequences.\\" (Discourses of Brigham Young, 256-257.)<br />Frankly, I found this essay rather perceptive and very insightful about many of the problems of society.  Mr. K. is an unquestioned genius-child prodigy at 15, educated a Harvard, and professing at Berkley-and this superman ability show through in his essay.  He reminds us of Hannibal Lecter, Wolf Larsen, or the other Ted, Ted Bundy.  And that is what is so . . . spellbinding about reading this Manifesto.  He is intelligent, has a lot of  good ideas and observations, but killing people?<br />I find Mr. K. an easy ready, and for a mathematician, he has a great facility for prose.  However, I quite disagree with Mr. K's solution.  And not just killing innocents. His madness goes beyond murder.  For example, Mr. K advocates undoing the Industrial Revolution.  In \\"Hurtling Toward Oblivion: A Logical Argument for the End of the Age,\\" Richard A. Swenson makes the point that one of the factor that futurists follow is the principle of irreversibility.  Commonlky stated, \\"We can't put the genie back in the bottle,\\" or \\"You can't turn back the clock.\\"<br />Mr. K. gets rather vague about how this revolution is to occur.  How do you unscramble an egg?  Not only is this madness, it is pure insanity!	2002-01-22

It carries a big explosion in a small package!<br />Like most people, I was introduced to J. B. Phillips via his rather bouncy and energetic translation of the New Testament; so buying this book was the next necessary and logical step.<br />In it, Mr. Phillips discusses way that we limit God; we limit His power, His influence in our lives. It reminds me of what Joseph Smith said, \\"It is the constitutional disposition of mankind to set up stakes and set bounds to the works and ways of the Almighty.\\"  We have these weird conceptions of God.  I think they come from Type \\"A\\" overachievers-these people who are the movers, shakers, and leaders in the world-who make God in their own image, so he ends up looking more like a rulebook, and less like a holy being.<br />For some reason, we don't want a strong God interfering in our life, telling us to love those oh, so obnoxious people.<br />Besides, a weak God is easier to control.<br />His section on God in the arts absolutely tore my head off.  Mr. Phillips makes the point that we never see God interacting with evil people, only with the Good, as if He is only concerned with the good.  In \\"Return of the Jedi,\\" near the end, we see Annikin/Darth Vader have a few pricks of conscience before he kills Emperor Palpatine, but you never see this wrestle with conscience in other villains.  But we know it goes on!<br />J. B. Phillips has a blessed gift for language that is flows, bounces, and he creates wonderful images that stick with you.  On top of these obvious linguistic abilities, he was a piercing insight that glances through the creaky creeds and misconceptions of our age, and into the holy of holies.	2002-01-08

First of all, this book is geared to temple-endowed remembers of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.  So if you want a basic book, I recommend \\"The Book of Mormon: Another Testament of Jesus Christ,\\" or \\"Standing For Something,\\" by Gordon B. Hinckley, the world-leader of the Church., or \\"A Marvelous Work and a Wonder,\\" by LeGrand Richards, or \\"Our Search For Happiness,\\" by M. Russell Ballard.  These books are designed as introductory texts, and explain our history, an what our basic beliefs are, and why we build temples.<br />This book, however, is written by a member for members, and has a very cutting edge to it.  It is a very sharp and repeated call to live after the manner of happiness, after the united order, or, in short, after the manner of Zion.<br />This book is a collection of samizdat discourses that circulated underground at Brigham Young University.  Dr. Nibley has the academic freedom to speak rather bluntly on the current economic order of things.  He is not a communist, or a capitalist, but a third party-a consecrationist.  He believes in restoring the early Christian order of things that prevailed in the primitive church (See Acts 2:32-37)<br />This book shakes you to the core as Dr. Nibley drives a stake thought the heart of the vampire of greed and selfishness.  It it not all attack, though.  This book opens your mind to focus on the things test matter, the eternal things, the peaceable things of the gospel.	2002-01-05

Several years ago, Dr. Joseph Fielding McConkie co-wrote a commentary on the Book of Mormon: Another Testament of Jesus Christ, and I ate it up!  Wonderful!  Wonderful!  But this book is more than a follow-up to the Doctrinal Commentary on the Book of Mormon. It is even more that a commentary on the Doctrine and Covenants: it truly is a commentary on many of the institutional Revelations of the Restoration. It includes not only the Doctrine and Covenants, but also the Joseph Smith Translation, the Joseph Smith History, the Lectures on Faith, the Book of Abraham, the Wentworth Letter, and the King Follette Discourse!<br />As you can see, this book is geared for members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, so if you wan an introductopry book, I would recommend \\"Standing for Something,\\" by the church's world leader, Gordon B. Hinckley.<br />Ezekiel bound the sticks of the Bible and the Book of Mormon together so that they become one! Not only should we bind the Bible and the Book of Mormon together, we need to bind them with the D&amp;C, and the Pearl of Great Price, and with the counsel of the living prophets and apostles. This bundle of sticks can be very heavy, but thank goodness for palm pilots!<br />This book is doctrinal heavy, so it doesn't have a lot of the historical tidbits that some my want, but Cook's \\"The Revelations of the Prophet Joseph Smith\\" would be better suited for such research. Or you could always go back to the primary text: \\"The History of the Church.\\" It does, however, focus on what we believe and who we should act, and traces the lines of revelation as they cut across the lives of the early Saints. As a historian (BA from BYU, class of 1995), I would prefer studying doctrine over history-as important as it is-since we are saved by Jehovah, the god of Israel, and not Clio, the muse of history.<br />This is the next step in evolution of commentaries and surpasses Hyrum Mack Smith's \\"Doctrine and Covenants Commentary,\\" which was the standard for so many generations. The McConkie-Ostler commentary has some advantages over the Smith commentary: it is more readable, it is up to date in the scholarship, up to date with the current revelations, and had an easier font. The disadvantage is the McConkie-Ostler commentary doesn't have the text of the D&amp;C in the book, unlike the Smith Commentary or McConkie's earlier \\"Doctrinal Commentary on the Book of Mormon.\\" The trade-off is between a larger, self contained work in several covers, or a slimmer, one volume, dependant work. I see merits and debits either way, and therefore respect the choice made.<br />On a personal note, Brother McConkie not only has the voice of his father, but the mind of his father as well.

It also includes a section where President Hinckley eulogizes past presidents of the church.<br />For non-members, this book can serve as an introduction to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.  Most of the books out there are decidedly against the Church.  This book allows you to read what the Saints themselves believe, as taught by their own leader.<br />The book is arraigned by topic, and has quotes of various lengths on the different subjects, as opposed to a collection of conference talks.

The Church of Jesu sChrist of Latter-day Saints was organized on 6 April 1830, so we are old enough to have theological classics, such as &quot;Mediation and Atonement,&quot; &quot;Jesus the Christ,&quot; and &quot;Articles of Faith.,&quot; which stand up to any sectarian Christian classic, such as &quot;Pilgrim's Progress,&quot; or &quot;Pensees.&quot; C. S. Lewis once observed that we need to read both old and new books, since the old books have stood the test of time, and that we should read an old book after reading a new one, just to keep our perspective clear. &quot;Key to the Science of Theology&quot; is a wonderful old book.<br />This book is dynamite! This sweet poet has a mind as iron as his brother Orson had, but also had the advantage of being a better writer. Parley's prose is powerful! Savor the title of the book: Keys, Science, Theology. Don't these words electrify you? Don't you feel that there is a power out there that Elder Pratt has accessed, and now he is comparing notes with you?<br />This book is a mini hurricane. He covers several topics, beginning with the Apostasy, then goes on to discuss the nature of God, and the creation, and the restoration. He has section 76, the Vision of the degrees of glory, complete in chapter 15.<br />I think his most interesting chapters are the ones nearly off-center in the index, but not off-center in doctrine. Chapter 11 discusses the nature of miracles, which discusses the energizing effect of the Holy Ghost. Chapter 12 is a discussion of angels and spirits, most likely based on his missionary experiences recounted in his Autobiography. Chapter 13 surveys the history and the power of dreams. These three chapters are worth the price of the book.<br />After the Lectures on Faith, this is really the second systematized book on general Latter-day theology. Therefore, it is of great historical value in seeing what the concerns of the post-Nauvoo Church were, and what issues people thought were important enough to write about. I'm not sure if this book is for members or non-members: the tone seems to indicate this as a type of missionary tract, but the subject matter definitely is not for a novice.  But intellectual giants always have larger eyes and broader views.  Thomas Aquinas saw his &quot;Summa Theologica,&quot; which covers 512 questions, 2669 articles, and 10,000 objections and replies and takes up 3000 pages, as being an introduction to Catholicism.<br />This book is also a wonderful companion to his Autobiography, since you see how some of his doctrines are based in his life's experience.were, and what issues people thought were important enough to write about.

This is not only one of classics of literature, but it is a classic in Christian literature.  There is no way of missing the Christian message of sacrifice, since Sydney Carton is a Christic figure who, by his death, lets the captive Charles Darnay go free.  For the real obtuse, Dickens quotes the bible several times!<br />Admittedly, one wag described a church as a gathering of hypocrites, and sadly, this may be right.  Books like this help Christians spiritually get their head on straight.  It is not preachy, save for the eloquence of example.  Yes this is a dark book, but it burns so brightly because the characters glow.<br />The darkness is the necessary element: the headless angels carved on dark wood, the grave robber, the wet blade of the Guillotine, and the outrages of injustice.  But that is an accurate depiction of the current scheme of things, and this darkness shows the shine of the characters.  The Truth is made manifest by the contrast.

If you remember, several years ago, Elder Ballard gave the same talk back to back in general conference.  Remember the subject?  It was on councils (See \\"Ensign,\\" November 1993, \\"Strength in Counsel,\\" \\"Ensign,\\" May 1994, \\"Counseling with our Councils.\\")<br />This book is in response to those two topics, so consider this a course in ecclesiastical management and religious organizational behavior.  We are not using the Church councils properly, and this book is one apostle's attempt to put us on the right track.<br />So often leadership is equated with office, or is seen as bossing people around.  This is not only wrong, but is dead wrong.  We have so many pairs of eyes in our wards and stakes: the elders presidents, the high priests, the Aaronic Priests, the Female's Relief Society, and every other auxiliaries, we are literally dying of thirst right by an artesian well.<br />This book has really opened my eyes.  I think that we have all the helps we really need under our noses.  The key is for the leaders to open the floodgates and let the people get busy.  People in the ward have ideas and insights that the priesthood leaders may miss.<br />The whole sum of creation was began with a grand council.  This is the eternal example for all of us.	2002-01-04

He covers the basics, but as President Hinckley has said, we learn by repetition. For those who are a fan of Widtsoe, this is an essential addition to their library.<br />The only drawback being that it is was designed for used in priesthood meetings, so it is not designed for non-Saints.  For anyone interesting in \\"first contact\\" with the Latter-day Saints, I would recommend reading \\"The Book of Mormon: Another Testament of Jesus Christ,\\" or \\"Standing for Something\\" by Gordon B. Hinckley, the current world leader of the Church.  Don't drink below the horses, including myself!<br />It should be noted that Brother Widtsoe comes from the point of view of a chemist and describes our theology in terms of rationality and a science. C. S. Lewis warned about &quot;Christianity And,&quot; (Screwtape Letters, chapter 25) such as &quot;Christianity and Pacifism,&quot; or &quot;Christianity and Vegetarianism,&quot; the problem being that we are diluting the Gospel and rewriting it in the light of our own hobbies or profession.<br />True, our theology is rational and can stand the scrutiny of a Thomas Aquinas or a Jesse Ventura, but it is not the product of a test-tube or a syllogism. In other words, Joseph Smith didn't get our religion from re-shuffling verses of the bible, or just deep thinking or pondering, but he got revelations. He said, &quot;I have got all the truth which the Christian world possessed, and an independent revelation in the bargain, and God will bear me off triumphant.&quot; (Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith, 376)<br />Despite this one point, would recommend this book for a new member learning, a non-member curious, or an old member wanting to review basics.  C. S. Lewis also said that we should alternate between reading old books, and new books, since the old ones have stood the test of time, whereas the new books, such as \\"Believing Christ,\\" or John Bytheway books are still on trial.

This is British humor; so if you don't get that flavor of humor, skip this.<br />This franchise is wildly popular, first starting out as a BBS radio program, and then turning into books, and finally a BBS miniseries.  There is something enduring about this humor, but I think the key to understand \\"The Hitchhiker's Guide to The Galaxy\\" is that the main character isn't Arthur Dent, or Ford Prefect, but rather the Galaxy itself.  Adams satirizes reality itself in these books.<br />These books are for anyone has had to put up with the absurdities of existence.  Consequently, in these books, Adams satirizes just about everything, but focuses his acid pen mainly on the politicians, philosophers and religionist since this unholy trinity is the primary gatekeeper of meaning in society.<br />Adams has a good eye not only for the absurd, but the wickedly fraudulent.  The main driving MacGuffen of the franchise is a quest for meaning, especially finding the answer to \\"Life, The Universe, and Everything,\\" and when that proves incoherent, the quest for the original question.  This humor is quite serious, since, as Joseph Smith observed, \\"if we start right, it is easy to go right all the time; but if we start wrong, we may go wrong, and it will be a hard matter to get right.\\"<br />Sadly the franchise slowly lost steam.  I think Adam \\"jumped the shark\\" with \\"So long and Thanks for all the Fish,\\" since he recreates the destroyed earth and introduces Fenchurch, and then abandons all of these in \\"Mostly Harmless.\\"  I think he had made his point in the first three books, but had an incredible franchise, so was encouraged to keep writing.<br />The first three books trace the quest for the answer and the question to \\"Life, the Universe and Everything,\\" and they come to the conclusion that both the question and the answer are mutually exclusive (Life, the Universe, and Everything, ch.34), which really settles the question and settles the quest.  But for whatever reason, Adams kept on writing-probably as the insistence of the editors Adams so acidly satirizes in \\"Mostly Harmless.\\"<br />These books originally were a radio series, so the first two books are adaptations of the radio, so they are quick reads, but since you'll laugh your head off, it will take a little bit longer.  \\"Life, the Universe and Everything\\" is Adams first novel, so it has a different feel.  CAUTION: If you don't understand the British sport cricket, just plow ahead-it isn't really that relevant to the story.<br />\\"So long and Thanks for all the Fish\\" is the shark-jump.  It was billed as book four of a trilogy, but the slick marketing didn't help the book out.  I think the problem was recreating the earth, which had been killed off.  Didn't Dallas do that?  \\"It's just a dream!\\"  The center of gravity of the franchise shifted from Arthur and the others being lost in the cosmos, but a relationship between Arthur and Fenchurch, with the Rain God doing precious little.  This story is an aberration, and anomaly.  Adam's recognized it, and dropped the thread in \\"Mostly Harmless.\\"  Don't let this deter you: even Shakespeare wrote bad plays.<br />\\"Yong Zaphod\\" isn't a story really, but more of a fragment. I wish that there were some explination about what it was, and where it was supposed to go.<br />\\"Mostly Harmless\\" is a very dark and gritty story, and reminds me of Mark Twain's later works such as \\"Connecticut Yankee.\\"  It is always a sad thing to a comedian go sour and bitter.  We actually see the logical out workings of an absurd universe.  The fun soon fades, and absurdity brings despair.  Adventure, excitement, and really wild things will eventually bore.<br />Three symbols in the story reflect this.  First, the electronic \\"Hitchhiker's Guide\\" stops working.  A Freudian slip, or a projection of Adams subconscious into the story?  I think the franchise and the fans got out of control.  The second symbol is the name of Arthur's and Trillian's quasi-daughter (Arthur donated to a sperm bank)-Random.  She is a symbol of the mainspring of the universe, but she is lost in the cosmos, as we all are.  The third symbol is \\"Random's Watch,\\" which should be the title of the story.  Random does a reverse Paley's Watch argument inferring meaning from the watch.

Adventure, excitement, and really wild things will eventually bore.<br />Three symbols in the story reflect this.  First, the electronic \\"Hitchhiker's Guide\\" stops working.  A Freudian slip, or a projection of Adams subconscious into the story?  I think the franchise and the fans got out of control.  The second symbol is the name of Arthur's and Trillian's quasi-daughter (Arthur donated to a sperm bank)-Random.  She is a symbol of the mainspring of the universe, but she is lost in the cosmos, as we all are.  The third symbol is \\"Random's Watch,\\" which should be the title of the story.  Random does a reverse Paley's Watch argument inferring meaning from the watch.

But no luck in searching in local bookstores, so I had to buy sight unseen on Amazon.com, which is not as risky as you might think, since they have a great returns policy, although I have never had to use it.<br />This book is really a stapled pamphlet of 92 pages, and has a light gray cover.  It seems to be something like a Gideon's Bible, where you get just the Bible with no study helps or background materials.  It is published by \\"Eastern Orthodox Books\\" in Willits, CA (By Ft Bragg and Ukiah in North CA), so it seems to be a quick religious publication designed for the faithful or as a devotional book as opposed to a scholarly work for the musty theologian.  Or the eager truth seeker.<br />Consequently, there are no introductory essays or biographical notes, which would be helpful for the greenhorn like myself.  C. S. Lewis wrote a somewhat helpful introductory essay to this treatise that can be found in the book \\"God in the Dock,\\" called \\"On the Reading of Old Books.\\"  However, a real brass-knuckles overview such as you would find in a Penguin, Oxford, or Cambridge Classics is absent.<br />The translation (no translator is mentioned) is a trifle thick and follows the King James-Authorized style of verbiage.  My denomination, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, used the KJV, and, since I am such a fan of Shakespeare and Milton, this style of English did not faze me.  However, having read J. B. Phillips New Testament and Seamus Heaney's \\"Beowulf,\\" I am quite open to better translations of the text.<br />There are also no notes on scriptures cited.  We can guess at the biblical references, but the references to Apocryphal books, or the pseudipigraphical \\"Pastor of Hermas\\" may be confusing to some.  The division into chapters and verses is always, always, always helpful, since it makes reading easier, and it facilitates referencing and cross-referencing ideas.<br />I found the title \\"On the Incarnation\\" not misleading, but an understatement. This treatise covers not only the incarnation, but also the Resurrection, and has some sections with apologetics.  I was surprised to see similar arguments that I have found in \\"The Case for Christ.\\"  Nihil Novi Sub Sola!<br />This treatise has influenced C. S. Lewis, especially his book \\"Mere Christianity,\\" and his speech \\"Weight of Glory.\\"  We have this statement from the beginning that man was created in God's image (Genesis 1:26), as opposed to plant and animal life, and later on in the Bible it says that we are gods (Psalms 82:6) and that we have been made a little lower than Eloheim (Psalms 8:5-most translations render this as angels, but this is a mistranslation!)  John Taylor, third president of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints said that we are \\"a spark of Deity struck from the fire of his eternal blaze.\\" (Gospel Kingdom, 1)  There is something here that modern, contemporary Christianity has lost, or at best ignored.  A doctrine not taught is a doctrine denied.  I am glad to have read this treatise-it gives me a reason to look up and see something else besides smog.is always, always, always helpful, since it makes reading easier, and it facilitates referencing and cross-referencing ideas.<br />I found the title \\"On the Incarnation\\" not misleading, but an understatement.

This is a fun little quote book that is priced right.  It has, in chronological order, quotes from all of the presidents under the Constitution up to Clinton.  This is rather a singular book, considering the scope of what the editor has done.  Some presidents, such as Lincoln, Kennedy, or Reagan who have been blesses with blarney and gab, have great humorous quotes.  Some presidents have a more philosophical bent, such as Jefferson and Madison, so a quote book does not do them justice.  Others, such as Grant or Silent Cal Coolidge, are taciturn, so you need to track quotes down with a magnifying glass and metal detector.<br />This book has ample quotes from all of the then-42 presidents, and is great for people who like quote books, public speakers, politicians, or people looking for bullet-thoughts that hit the target.	2001-12-07

Mr. Hickham has combined political intrigue with technical space expertise--imagine if Tom Clancy had worked for NASA, and you get the idea.  As the title and the cover art indicates, this is a story about using the space shuttle to go to the moon.  But it is much more-there is a credible reason why someone wants to go back to the moon, with powerful political and financial players who want to stop this voyage.  So this isn't like seeing that old Don Knotts film \\"The Reluctant Astronaut,\\" but is more like seeing clips of \\"Nixon\\" interspliced with \\"Apollo 13.\\"  But have said too much as it is.<br />The genius of this book is Mr. Hickham's insider understanding of NASA, so the willful suspension of disbelief come that much easier.  He paints the milieu of the space culture with a fine brush and striking detail, and highlights the clash between NASA and the nation government with bold realism.  I almost think that he has told us a bit too much about why we haven't gone back to the moon.  You are pulled into the middle of the turmoil of the not to distant future, and are actually at the helm of the Columbia in its voyage.  The gems are the pervasive acronyms that confuse at first, but like good curry, come back to warm you.<br />The chapters are short, but pass with machine-gun rapidity, and Mr. Hickham's prose is smooth. This book is unboring, undull, unpassive.  It is one of the most exciting books I have ever read so far.  There is no drag or lag.  Every word counts!<br />I have met Mr. Hickham, and, yes, he is very much like the way he is portrayed in \\"October Sky.\\"  He is a very nice gentleman who has written a very nice book.	2001-11-27

It has ample selections from Joseph Smith's writings such as the Lectures on Faith, some of his revelations such as the Vision of the Three Degrees of Glory, which is published in the Doctrine and Covenants.  It gives you a great introduction into the unique aspects of Joseph Smith as an American Prophet.<br />This book does the job it was intended to do--give you a quick peek at a complex man and his theology.<br />I recommend this for the student of the Church of Jesus Christ if Latter-day Saints, or anyone curious about what Joseph Smith actually said and actually did.  He speaks for him self in this book.  It is also useful for anyone who is curious about Joseph Smith, and would like to understand him in his own terms.<br />This review is actually a review of the book, and not a review of Joseph Smith or of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.	2001-11-22

It surpasses these goals magnificently!<br />Being a novice . . . No, that is too polite.  Being blasted ignorant of Eastern Orthodoxy, I decided to pick up this book to help open my eyes and my mind to this great religious tradition.  This book has absolutely blown me out of the water.  I was surprised to see similarities with my denomination (The Church of Jesus Christy of Latter-day Saints), and the Eastern Orthodox tradition.<br />Some tidbits:  The Orthodox Church baptizes children by immersion three times: once in the name of the Father, once in the name of the Son, and once in the name of the Holy Ghost.  They method of confirming children is similar to \\"Last Rites,\\" where they anoint and bless the forehead, eyes, ears, mouth, hands and feet individually as part of the ceremony.  Also in their wedding ceremonies, the Orthodox Church literally crowns the couple, symbolic of man's triumph in marriage.<br />What was most appealing was the idea of Theosis, or for man's ability to become God.  We do not partake of His essence; we just partake of his power.  This idea has roots in the Old Testament (Ps. 82:10), and early Christianity (2 Peter 1:4).  St. Athanasius said that God became man, so that men might be god (On the Incarnation, 54), and Anglican C. S. Lewis has also elaborated on this idea in Mere Christianity (Book IV, ch. 9 \\"Counting the Cost), and also his address called \\"Weight of Glory\\" in the book by the same name.  There is an old idea here that the Western traditions of Protestantism and Roman Catholicism have lost, but have survived in the Eastern Orthodox sanctuary, and have been heartily embraced.<br />There is so much common ground here, I wonder why we bicker so much and have such nasty civil wars among ourselves.  I hope this book can serves as bridge of understanding and appreciation among the different traditions of Christianity!<br />The book has several historical chapters, staring with the early councils, up until the time of the Reformation.

This book is a superb (and necessary!) follow-up to Strobel's \\"The Case for Christ.\\"  This volume deals with the Big Eight objections to Christianity:<br />1) Evil.<br />2) Miracles.<br />3) Evolution.<br />4) Dying Children.<br />5) Jesus is the only way to heaven.<br />6) Hell<br />7) Christianity's bad example in history<br />8) Since I have doubts, I can't be a Christian.<br />So if you have any questions along these eight areas, this book can be helpful.<br />Strobel follows the pattern used in \\"The Case for Christ\\" by interviewing world-renown experts in these areas.  Two conversations jump out-Peter Kreeft, a Catholic theologian and philosopher who discusses the nature of evil; and Ravi Zacharias, an India-born theologian whit one of the keenest minds alive, who discusses Jesus' exclusive claims as Savior of the world.  As you can see, this book deals with \\"Broad Christianity,\\" and has multicultural insights to these questions.<br />I am impressed with Strobel's smooth style of writing.  It is written on about the high-school level, so anyone can understand the ideas, issues and responses.  This book was a quick read for me, since it is only eleven chapters long.  Granted, these chapters are moderately long, but Strobel did a capital job of editing the conversations down to the manageable and essential level.<br />Lastly, I am impressed with the hard answers to the hard questions to Christianity.  All of the interviewees are respectful of non-Christians beliefs. This is not a bash book, but a restrained and fruitful discussion of the ideas surrounding Christianity.<br />True for You, but Not for Me : Deflating the Slogans That Leave Christians Speechless by Paul Copan would be a nice companion volume, since they cover the same ground, but have different approaches to the truth.<br />ONE FINAL POINT: On page 96, William Lane Craig, Ph.D., says that there is a \\"blatant lack of corroboration\\" in archaeological discoveries with \\"The Book of Mormon: Another Testament of Jesus Christ.\\"  This is sheer and utter nonsense. For example, Immanuel Tov, Dead Sea Scroll Czar, pointed out in a colloquium that the famous Copper Scroll is similar to the gold plates that the Book of Mormon was written on.

The ten issues are:<br />1) Are Latter-day Saints Christian?<br />2) What do Latter-day Saints believe about God?<br />3) Do latter-day Saints believe in the Bible and biblical Christianity?<br />4) Does God speak to his children in ways other than through the Bible?<br />5) Do Latter-day Saints believe that men and women can become Gods?<br />6) What do latter-day Saints mean when they say that God was once a man?<br />7) What do Latter-day Saints believe a person must do to be saved?<br />8) Do the doctrines and practices of the LDS Church change?<br />9) Ho do latter-day Saints believe they should live their lives?<br />10) Why do Latter-day Saints try to convert others?<br />I hope this gets your interest whetted.

Millet, the Dean of Religion at Brigham Young University-Provo and Dr. Noel Reynolds, an academic vice president at Brigham young University--Provo, are the editors, with several contributors from the Religious Faculty at BYU.<br />This booklet allows us to speak for ourselves, unfiltered and undistorted.

It is commonplace to observe that we are a \\"dumbed-down\\" society, where maudlin emotion has replaced feeling; slogans have replaced thought; and opinion has usurped conclusion. It is painfully funny to see people repeat ... platitudes and aphorisms instead of using original reason and thought. This process has becomes so pronounced that we rapidly repeat words such as \\"diversity,\\" \\"\\"tolerance,\\" or \\"rights,\\" as if the words themselves were a definition. We actually use these words more like an incantation, but I digress!<br />Mr. Copan has collected twenty-four \\"slogans\\" that non-Christians use to trump Christians into silence. Such slogans are: \\"All religions lead to God,\\" \\"Christians are intolerant,\\" or \\"Who are you to judge?\\" These slogans-not arguments or evidence, but mere slogans-should not flummox Christians as they share their feelings about Christ, but often times they do. Additionally, Mr. Copan has outlined some responses to these slogans. They are not designed to win arguments, but designed to open up the doors of the mind and allow for an actual discussion about Christianity.<br />I am one who enjoys the mental swordplay associated with actual discussion. Not the shouting, lies, deflection, denials, or exaggerations that go on in the majority of discussion, but the actual mathematically precise premise-to-conclusion ratiocination that goes on with intelligent discussion. This book helps clarify ones thinking on issues that normally stop Christians dead in their tracks. Remember, God created the brain as well as the heart!<br />This book is also good for anyone curious about the claims of Christianity. To be honest, Christianity claims a lot, and a lot of it is so unbelievable and so unusual that an explanation is rightfully due. I hope that curiosity will be the knob on the door of discovery.<br />As a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, I am not really bothered by the criticism of my denomination. It gets criticized so often that I think it unusual when it is *not* criticized!

If you have any question about Christology among the Mormons, this book will answered any and every question.<br />Joseph F. Smith, the President of the Church, commissioned James E. Talmage, a member of the Quorum of Twelve Apostles, to write this biography on the life of Christ.  The idea was to use this book as a home reference and a Church textbook.  He more than met the challenge, and this book is still in print almost 100 years later, and is standard work for LDS Missionaries.<br />This book covers every aspect of Christ as best can be expected in one volume.  It begins with Christ premortal existence, his mortal ministry in Palestine, his atonement, and finally his post mortal ministry in the Spirit Word (I believe . . . he was crucified, dead, and buried; he descended into hell) and among the Nephites as recorded in the Book of Mormon: Another Testament of Jesus Christ.<br />The only two drawbacks with this book are it size, and the verbiage.  Elder Talmage was an Englishman, so he spoke with an Englishman's vocabulary.  A dictionary solves this problem.	2001-11-18

McConkie, an apostle in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, gave a talk where he said that the three pillars of eternity were the Creation, the Fall and the Atonement.<br />This thought-grid is important because these three issues strike at the heart of Christianity.  Atheists and every other brand of theist need to understand the Christian outlook on these three things because like the Godhead, these three are the one central doctrine of Christian.  If you understand these three, then you have a good handle on Christianity.<br />For example, out understanding of the Creation and the Fall of Adam gives the reason why we need Christ as a redeemer.  And since we believe that Christ is our redeemer, then there is a certain way we need to live.<br />This book is a missionary book-it shows non-Christians what Christians believe; and helps Christians know what they should believe.<br />Mr. Colson's style is frictionless.  His words are invisible.  There is no gap between his ideas and our understanding.  Oh, what I wouldn't give to write like that!	2001-11-18

But I think there is a silent majority out there who will have open ears along with an open mind and an open heart, so \\"Excelsior\\"!<br />This book is, as its title page says, is book about Jesus Christ and how He has interacted with us humans in the past.  Specifically, it is to show that this man Jesus was indeed the Son of God.  That is the hinge-point of Christianity; but so many people today have questions about the divinity of Christ.  Some eve believe that he was just a good teacher, although they dislike what he taught.  This book is new scripture, on par, but not replacing, the Bible.<br />It shows Jesus Christ as he deals with two groups of peoples, the first was lead out of the old world to the new world at the time of the tower of Babel, and the second group of people was led out of Jerusalem about AD 600, and also led to the Americas.<br />The highlight of the book is when Jesus Christ appeared to the second group of people after his Resurrection, and retells the simple message of the Gospel to the people there.<br />I can't convince anyone to buy, to read, or to believe this book, but I do hope that you would ask God in prayer and then be honest with the answer you receive.<br />The Tile Page of the Book of Mormon:<br />THE<br />BOOK OF MORMON<br />AN ACCOUNT WRITTEN BY<br />THE HAND OF MORMON<br />UPON PLATES<br />TAKEN FROM THE PLATES OF NEPHI<br />Wherefore, it is an abridgment of the record of the people of Nephi, and also of the Lamanites-Written to the Lamanites, who are a remnant of the house of Israel; and also to Jew and Gentile-Written by way of commandment, and also by the spirit of prophecy and of revelation-Written and sealed up, and hid up unto the Lord, that they might not be destroyed-To come forth by the gift and power of God unto the interpretation thereof-Sealed by the hand of Moroni, and hid up unto the Lord, to come forth in due time by way of the Gentile-The interpretation thereof by the gift of God.<br />An abridgment taken from the Book of Ether also, which is a record of the people of Jared, who were scattered at the time the Lord confounded the language of the people, when they were building a tower to get to heaven-Which is to show unto the remnant of the House of Israel what great things the Lord hath done for their fathers; and that they may know the covenants of the Lord, that they are not cast off forever- And also to the convincing of the Jew and Gentile that JESUS is the CHRIST, the ETERNAL GOD, manifesting himself unto all nations-And now, if there are faults they are the mistakes of men; wherefore, condemn not the things of God, that ye may be found spotless at the judgment-seat of Christ.<br />TRANSLATED BY JOSEPH SMITH, JUN.to the interpretation thereof-Sealed by the hand of Moroni, and hid up unto the Lord, to come forth in due time by way of the Gentile-The interpretation thereof by the gift of God.<BR>An abridgment taken from the Book of Ether also, which is a record of the people of Jared, who were scattered at the time the Lord confounded the language of the people, when they were building a tower to get to heaven-Which is to show unto the remnant of the House of Israel what great things the Lord hath done for their fathers; and that they may know the covenants of the Lord, that they are not cast off forever- And also to the convincing of the Jew and Gentile that JESUS is the CHRIST, the ETERNAL GOD, manifesting himself unto all nations-And now, if there are faults they are the mistakes of men; wherefore, condemn not the things of God, that ye may be found spotless at the judgment-seat of Christ.<BR>TRANSLATED BY JOSEPH SMITH, JUN.	2001-11-17

To begin, I am not so much fascinated by Buckaroo Banzai as I am fascinated by the fascination!  I saw the movie on tape back in '84 and was confused (the flashback scene after Dr. Lizardo gets charged up threw me off-I thought the electricity caused the flashback somehow), so after seeing so many fan-pages on the net, I decided to buy the VHS and see what the entire hubbub was about.<br />After five viewing, I think I understand the appeal.  So I bought the book.<br />First of all, which is better-the book or the movie?  I think that the book has the \\"Dune\\" problem, in that we are placed in a complex world with plots within plots within plots, and it is almost as if we are joining both \\"Dune\\" and \\"Buckaroo Banzai\\" in \\"Part Six\\" of a series. The book starts out very thick and layer with much of the Hong Kong Cavalier's past alluded to in the text and in the MANY footnotes.  However, the book seems to loose steam in places where the movie is strongest, such as the chase scenes at the end.<br />In some parts of the book, we are reading a script-a la \\"This side of Paradise.\\"  This allows for quicker, choppier action to be presents almost as it is seen on the movie.  But it also may be due Rauch getting tired of novelizing his script.<br />Secondly, the style.  Rauch's prose was choppy and bulky at first, but I got used to his style.  The story is told from the point of view of Reno, much like Doyle had Watson as Sherlock Holmes's chronicler.  This allows us to share the wonder and mystery of the dominating Elvis-like figure that moves events.  It supplements the enchantment, and allows us to follow the non-Banzai threads of the book.<br />The narrative has minimal exposition, which keeps the story punchy, but you feel that there is a whole new world with a whole new history behind it, and we are given a peek.  Watson always alluded to untold Holmes cases, and Rauch does the same thing as combo parody-tribute.  This complexity works well for \\"Dune\\" and \\"Lord of The Rings,\\" and makes the milieu glisten and teem with life.<br />Rauch also peppers his book with oddball, quirky humor.  If you are not careful you can miss the gags and one-liners that are so apparent in the movie.  With this mulligan soup is a peppering of philosophy-some of it quite observant, some of the philosophy reminds me of my thoughts as 14-year old thinking I was unusually profound.  Orson Scott Card once described this type of thinking as \\"undergraduate level philosophy.\\" (Children of the Mind).  Then again, this may be part of the humor, a sort of hyper-irony that is prevalent in \\"The Simpsons.\\"<br />As far as novelizations go, this one has merit.  I always prefer it when the scriptwriters novelize their own stories, since the authors are telling their own story, instead of having a distant hack try to elusively capture the writer's passion and dream.<br />I think the cover is an improvement over the original book-it is more eye-catching, more engaging.  Among the original book cover, the original VHS cover, the VHS reissue cover, and the DVD cover, I think the book ahs the best composition.  It would have been nice to have some continuity between the covers so we are not confused.  But then again, how do you package the #2 cult film of all time.  I will sell itself by reputation.<br />For any hard-core fan of the film, I endorse this book, since so many jokes in the movie now make sense.  In one scene, New Jersey mistakes Reno for Pecos-well, Pecos is a woman!  The casual fan would also be interested, or anyone wanting a quick read.

Latter-day Saints do not have a strong apologetics tradition. Basically, we say &quot;Read the Book of Mormon, pray over what you have read, and then be honest with the answer you receive.&quot; (Book of Mormon, p. 529-530; Teachings of Ezra Taft Benson, p. 61-62) And this is how it should be. Truth should be so easy that a child should understand it; and when you bring in lawyers and doctors and philosophers and whatnot to &quot;help&quot; and &quot;clarify,&quot; you are in trouble.<br />This debate between Elder B. H. Roberts (the presidency of the Quorum of Seventy Apostles, i.e. a general world leader) with the Rev. Van der Donckt is therefore unusual, and this singularity is what makes this book fascinating reading.<br />Chapter One is a straightforward elaboration of what the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints believes about God the Eternal Father, his Son Jesus Christ and the Holy Ghost. Chapter two contains a reply from the Rev. Van der Donckt to Elder Robert's teachings. The rejoinder not only constitutes a Catholic reply, but also serves as a response embracing the quote-unquote &quot;traditional Christianity,&quot; inasmuch as both Protestants and Catholics (generally) subscribe to the same creeds-Nicean and Athanasian.<br />Chapter Three is Elder Robert's rejoinder to the Rev. Van der Donckt reply, and it is in this rejoinder you see the strength of the Church of Jesus Christ's position. For example, the creeds hold that God is unchanging, but Elder Robert's points out that Christ is God, and the Reverend's position is that God is unchanging. But Christ started out as spirit, was then born (incarnated), then was crucified, and then resurrected. So he gained, lost, and regains this body, and isn't that a change? (P.95)<br />Boing!<br />The rest of the books contains statements from church presidents Joseph Smith, Joseph F. Smith, Brigham Young and LDS apostle Orson Pratt, plus a chapter comparing religious traditions vis-&agrave;-vis Jesus Christ.<br />The Prophet Joseph Smith said, &quot;By proving contraries, truth is manifest.&quot; (History of the Church 6:428) This debate proves that, and this book would be useful for review and pondering for Saints and the curious anywhere.<br />The type is readable, being a facsimile edition of the original book.

Most of his errors are what logician call &quot;informal fallacies,&quot; or error with the type of inferences he makes with his data.<br />To his credit, Nietzsche is a very bouncy, scintillating an energetic writer.  I think that many people can learn from his literary style.  I certainly have.  But a well-perfumed lie is like a well-perfumed skunk: eventually both will stink, since you cannot change their nature no matter how pretty you make them up to be!<br />Here are some samples of hi errors:<br />P. 56.  &quot;Let us consider finally what naivety it is to say 'man ought to be thus and thus.'&quot;  In other words, we ought not say ought.  See the internal incoherency?<br />Ibid. &quot;We others, we immoralists, have on the contrary open wide our hearts to every kind of understanding, comprehension, approval.&quot;  Has he opened his heart wide to accept religion or God?  This, by the way, is called &quot;dicto simplicter,&quot; or a sweeping generalization; and it is also an &quot;iron man&quot; argument, where you overstate your own position.<br />P. 64.  &quot;The error of free will. --We no longer have any sympathy today with the concept of 'free will.&quot;  One you remove freedom, you remove meaning.  If Hitler, Dahmer, or whom ever wasn't free to choose not to become incarnate devils, then we cannot hold them accountable.  We do not blame blind people for being born blind because they simply have no control over that condition.  But we do have an ability to control our own souls, to make gods and angels of ourselves, or to make demons and devils of ourselves.  If we have no freedom, then we have no penal system, simply the criminal could not control his or herself.  And that would be hell on earth.<br />Ibid.  &quot;Men were thought of as 'free' so that they could become guilt.&quot;  This is probably a Freudian Slip on Nietzsche's part.  Religion has a cutting edge to it--always repent and do not make excuses for your meanness.  We get so concerned about the evil in the world around us; we forget the evil deep within us.<br />P. 66. &quot;One knows my demand of philosophers that they place themselves beyond good and evil--that they have the illusion of moral judgments beneath them.&quot;  It is good to be beyond good.  It is moral to be beyond morality.  In other words, Nietzsche assumes what he tries to disprove.<br />The only reason why I think Nietzsche's philosophy caught on is that first, he was a bouncy and vibrant voice.  I enjoy reading his works because they are rather witty and quick and slicing.  Secondly, his philosophy is very flattering one.  God is dead; you become the Superman and replace God (Thus Spoke Zarathustra, ch. 24).  This unctuous punch has made many people punch drunk with lust.  A very appealing idea that you can become a new god by yourself, which is the oldest lie in the Book!<br />The Anti-Christ:<br />Being a Christian does not dampen or deny my ideas, being biased against the conclusion, any more than an atheist is tainted, being biased in favor of the conclusion.  Bias cuts both ways.<br />It is true, and no one doubts this, many abuses have been in the name of religion.  But is it fair to judge a thing by its abuse?  Shall we judge all Austrians by the abuses of Hitler? Do we throw out Mozart with the bathwater?  No.  Nietzsche makes yet another &quot;dicto simplicter&quot; in accusing Christians of being unworthy.<br />As I read his treatment of Christianity, I kept asking myself, &quot;What religion is he talking about?&quot;  It seems that Nietzsche is describing Christianity in the worst possible of terms, as if he intentionally wants to misunderstand what the religions is about.  It is like the genies or fairy that play syntax-games with the wishes they grant human beings--&quot;Make me a sandwich!&quot;  *Poof!*<br />In conclusion, I find Nietzsche an engaging, fun and passionate writer.  We haveso man wet noodles out there; it is great to read some one with a backbone.  However, Nietzsche falls apart miserably with his non-existent logic.  And that is a deathblow.<br />The Book:<br />This is a great \\"two-fer,\\" since both books are rather slender and trim books.  Penguin Classics always does a superb job with these books-the introductory essays are helpful and the notes are useful.  They type is excellent and there are no typos.

The Overview:<br />This is one of a recent slew of books that deal with hypothetical conversations between great people, such as Ravi Zacharias's &quot;Lotus and the Cross&quot; which is a conversation between Jesus and Buddha, or Truman Madsen's &quot;Five Classics&quot; which has a hypothetical conversation between Joseph Smith and a mother with a blind baby.  They provide a vehicle for translating the philosophy into practical reality of day-to-day life and pain.<br />Of course the godfather of all these dialogues is Plato.  The power and charm of this method of presentation is that it takes what is oftentimes an ethereal philosophical concept and translates it to realistic situations, such as the price of tomatoes or why I am hurting.<br />The Idea:<br />Due to an odd coincidence, President John F. Kennedy, Dr. C. S. Lewis, and Aldous Huxley died on the same day:  22 November 1963.  Dr. Kreeft imagines what happens in the afterlife as these three men meet and interact.  In a Socratic sense, Kreeft uses these three men to elaborate the three types of Christianity present today: Lewis and the traditional Christianity; Kennedy and the modern Christianity; and Huxley and the mystical Christianity.<br />The real question behind all of the words and wrangling is the divinity of Christ.  When that doctrine goes, everything else uniquely Christian soon falls, so the afterlife discussion is of capital importance for Christians.  We allow people the freedom to believe whatever they want to believe, but there is commitment to the truth along with the commitment to good feelings and respect for other people.<br />The main thrust of the book is to show by logic that Christ was in fact divine.  These arguments are great apologetic scaffolding prior to gaining a personal witness.  We sometimes get caught up in the idea that religion is solely and affair of the heart, but this book reminds us that God also gave us a brain, and that has a bearing on how and what we worship.<br />By the way, Gov. Jesse Ventura once remarked \\"Organized religion is a sham and a crutch for weak-minded people who need strength in numbers.\\"  I wonder how well and how long the Hon. Gov.<br />Ventura would stand in a debate with Dr. Peter Kreeft?<br />The Book:<br />The prose is an easy read.  Peter Kreeft is one of these rare people who combine laser logic with righteous wit!  That is what makes this book not only challenging but enchanting.<br />The text is formatted like a script or play, so it is easy to keep track of who is talking and you can keep the characters and ideas straight.  I guess if he wanted to, this book could make a frictionless transition to TV or VHS.  The story is presented in one long act, with ample sidebar summaries to help you keep the arguments ordered, although I wonder if it would have been better to divide the text into scenes or acts to help punctuated the discussion.<br />The cover-art is classic, and I hope they keep the same picture on every edition--it helps to see these three great men together as we weigh their ideas and viewpoints.<br />My religion (Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints) does not have a strong apologetics tradition per se: we say, \\"If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God\\" (James 1:5), and be honest with the answer you get to your prayer.  So it was fascinating to read the book and understand the sophisticated logic behind what Kreeft another others believe, the logical reason why he believes in the divinity of Christ./>By the way, Gov.

All I can ask is to pray over this book, and be honest with the answer you get.<br />Here is the Testimony of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, form the introduction to the book:<br />TESTIMONY OF THE<br />TWELVE APOSTLES TO THE TRUTH OF<br />THE BOOK OF DOCTRINE AND COVENANTS<br />The Testimony of the Witnesses to the Book of the Lord's Commandments, which commandments He gave to His Church through Joseph Smith, Jun., who was appointed by the voice of the Church for this purpose:<br />We, therefore, feel willing to bear testimony to all the world of mankind, to every creature upon the face of the earth, that the Lord has borne record to our souls, through the Holy Ghost shed forth upon us, that these commandments were given by inspiration of God, and are profitable for all men and are verily true.<br />We give this testimony unto the world, the Lord being our helper; and it is through the grace of God the Father, and His Son, Jesus Christ, that we are permitted to have this privilege of bearing this testimony unto the world, in the which we rejoice exceedingly, praying the Lord always that the children of men may be profited thereby.	2001-11-17

Some thoughts and arrows:<br />1) We all know that boys are unlimited dynamos--just asks any mother, but now it seems that being male is a disease.  All feminist titters aside, this is a serious issue.  Many feminists trace the history of tragedy--and rightfully so in many areas--about abuses of men on women.  This book is the beginning of the history of female abuses on men.<br />2) Ms. Summers does have a provocative title, and I am surprised that the editor let her get away with it!<br />3) It is interesting to note that Ms. Summers focuses on public education, where it seems that literally everything is going on and being done except education.  Three Questions:  Who understand men better: men or women?  Which sex dominates the education field?  If there are a lot of women, who don't understand men well, in education, what problems does this create?<br />4) What Summers doesn't say it that this &quot;War on Boys&quot; may be the tool some radical feminists use to get back at men.<br />5) Why is the book so thin?  Probably because this is the opening shot in the \\"War on Boys.\\"  There is no data primarily because there is no money, and there is no money primarily because there is no interest, and there is no interest because people are not aware.<br />6) TAJ MAHAL: Boys have energy, boys have stamina and the standard response has to drug them up with Prozac.  The key word that Ms. Doesn't use is &quot;sublimation,&quot; or the process where you make holy something that is profane.  Men can make their testosterone sweet ambrosia by applying their energy to constructive purposes.  Hence the Taj Mahal.	2001-11-16

You have to hand it to Kreeft for taking some of the greatest ratiocination ever, and translating it into commonspeak.  Thomas Aquinas is one of the greatest minds ever to grace God's green earth, but too often--probably due to his religion--he has been marginalized.  Generally, we just read his &quot;Five Ways&quot; that prove God's existence.  However, this is much more to Thomism than this one philosophical derringer.<br />For those unaware, Thomas Aquinas was the Catholic scholar who produces two L*A*R*G*E, multi-volume books on Catholic theology: \\"Summa Contra Gentiles\\" and \\"Summa Theologica,\\" the latter being a summation of Catholic theology.  This book is a summation of \\"Summa Theologica,\\" and serves as a handbook and thumbnail for both Catholic Theology and Philosophy and Christian philosophy in general.<br />Aquinas has a sharp mind and can both divide the word and divide a question in a way that few others can.  I am not Catholic, but stand in deep admiration for Aquinas's work and mind, and more especially because he minded his work by working his mind.<br />The Book:<br />Kreeft has selected the essential texts and questions that illuminate aspects of Thomistic philosophy/theology.  He has the text with explanatory notes in footnotes, which is unusual since we are not reading a summery or rephrasing of Aquinas, but actually reading his words and ideas, unfiltered and undistorted.<br />His chapter divisions follow closely the divisions used in the whole \\"Summa Theologica,\\" and focus primarily on the first part of part one, and the second part of part two of the \\"Summa Theologica,\\" and doesn't deal with the latter books that deal with the church and the nature of sacraments. This summation, therefore, would not be offensive to any Christian.<br />The notes are gems, especially with his illustrations--Kreeft has united his analytical left-brain with his creative right brain, so there is no double-mindedness with what he is doing.  His pictures save a thousand words!<br />The glossary is helpful for the Latin words and technical terms that have a specialized meaning in Thomism.<br />The Printing:<br />This book uses the \\"Fathers of English Dominican Province\\" translation, which bears the Nihil Obstant and Imprimatur, the Roman Catholic &quot;Good housekeeping Seal of Approval&quot; that lets us know the text has passed the censor.  It is approved for Catholic consumption!

As September 11th shows, we are not one world, and these types of books can help open our mind.  Dr. Z's expertise comes from who he is--an Indian who emigrated to Canada, then to the United states.  So he is really capable because he is an amphibian: both Eastern and Western, Hindu and Christian.<br />He follows the Platonic pattern of not selling a syllogism, but designing a dialogue to illustrate an idea.  This is a hypothetical qudrologue involving Jesus and Buddha as they discuss and talk with a young prostitute about why she is dying of AIDS.  Hardball questions with hardball answers.<br />I am impressed with the amount of research Dr. Z put into this book--hours and hours of interviews with Buddhist monks in Malaysia, Thailand, India, and Singapore.  That may be why so many people don't like the book:  Dr, Z is discussing real Buddhism, not the watered down, Americanized Buddhism that is more a combination of Star Trek and Hallmark than anything that the Buddha ever taught.<br />The book is small, with an unimposing 94 pages and is 6&quot; X 6&quot;, so it can be read in one setting.

The binding has held up to my rough handling.<br />This book will not satisfy everyone, since it deals with very hard and sensitive issues, very personal issues, but I hope that quote-unquote sensitivity is not a cop out from thought and a well-meaning calm discussion.  I am a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and it is an odd thing not to see my religion criticized, but I have never backed down from a free and honest discussion.  In fact, if religion cannot stand up to hardball and slicing questions, then it is as Gov. Jesse Ventura has said, just &quot;a sham and a crutch for weak-minded people who need strength in numbers.&quot;	2001-11-13

Really, we will know if this book is good if we can actually get published and better yet, if we can win awards.  So in this axis, the jury is still out.<br />But in other axes, we can safely comment . . .<br />Axis 2:  This book is written in Mr. Card's clear and engaging style.  He is a very gripping writer and has thought out things and communicated them well.<br />Axis 3:  This book has serendipitously helped me appreciate literature.  Just last night, I saw Disney's &quot;The Black Cauldron,&quot; and I was able to pick up the techniques and tools used to develop the story, which in turn has helped in my overall appreciation of literature.<br />Axis 4: The book has great organization, with each chapter being focused and succinct.  Unlike many &quot;Niagara Falls&quot; chapters in other books, this one controls the information you get and illustrates the ideas with a hypothetical story.<br />Axis 5:  The cover is very engaging--a stylistic and hip photo with cutout men hints at the books contents.<br />Axis 6:  The binding has held up to my vicious pen attacks and rereads.

You must appreciate the good Rabbi&#8217;s desire for straight talk on this tough issue, when so many people give crooked answers and speak with a forked tongue.  In the introduction, R. Kushner explains that the book had its beginnings when his son Aaron was diagnosed with Progeria, the rapid-aging disease.  This book isn&#8217;t idle speculation or an academic toy, but was forged in the crucible of pain.<br />You cannot fault anyone for asking these hardball questions&#8212;it is the glorious Jewish Chutzpah.  Christianity speaks of &#8220;com[ing] boldly to the throne of grace&#8221; (Hebrews 4:16), and that is what Kushner does, asking these hardball question.  Who hasn&#8217;t wondered about these things?<br />Not being Jewish, and having heard R. Kushner speak at Brigham Young University, I was quite impressed with him, and finally dug down to read his most famous of books.  The title is arresting, and says it all.<br />Joseph Smith once said that it was an &#8220;unhallowed principle&#8221; to say people suffering comes from wickedness.  We see this most pointedly with children.<br />In Chapter One, he begins with an overview of the discussion and lists the normal explanations most religions have for why evil exists.  The only problem I found it that R. Kushner, I believe, assumes too much when he reaches his conclusion.<br />For example, when he discusses the punitive theory for evil, he assumes that people are good, with the sub-assumption that people cannot improve.  I disagree&#8212;everyone can improve just a little in everything.  For example, the last time I got a traffic ticket, I drove like a paranoid driver fro about a month.  I felt awful, but my driving was at it&#8217;s best.  I&#8217;ve slumped a little since then, but the punishment did get my act together and who knows how many traffic incidents for myself and for others since then?  Yes, sometimes innocents do get involve, but some times guilty people do get involved also.<br />Another area of disagreement is the &#8220;ending of a phase&#8221; argument, when a person is perfect in and area then gets moved on to heaven.  How do we really know what state a person is in?  That is the whole point of us not judging is that we don&#8217;t know the state of a person&#8217;s soul at anytime.  We all have a vivid internal life that is also quiet and hidden from other people, this life of desires and whatnot is the real self.  Conceivably, people who die are ready.<br />Children suffering. How to put this without sounding like a Nazi or an Inquisitor? But Judaism is more a religion of the &#8220;here and now&#8221; and doesn&#8217;t deal with the afterlife. The afterlife does provide some answers to why we have suffering.  Joseph Smith once said that all loses made up in the resurrection, and that is part of our hope.  R. Kushner says that is there is no justice in this life.  We are all agreed on this point.  But what about the next life, an eternal, never-ending life?  Can one year of pain be balanced against an eternity of bliss?<br />Incidentally, I believe that PART of the reason why God lets things go on like this is that evil people can change.  Look at St. Paul.  What would have happened if God had zapped him early on?  This painful waiting is par of God&#8217;s mercy.  (...)<br />Rabbi Kushner also discusses the notion that people die before that finish their life&#8217;s work.  So what is the standard of important and unimportant work?  We laud the cancer-curers or the scientists and artist, but doesn&#8217;t the burger-flipper have any vale with his life&#8217;s work?  The value of a burger-flipper becomes apparent when you are hungry.<br />Chapter Two is marvelous chapter on Job.  No comment is necessary.<br />In Chapter Three, he discusses the idea that life is a test, and how sometimes people fail life&#8217;s test.  Well, first of all, are we sure that they have failed?  What is the source of his information that they have failed?  We keep on coming bat to &#8220;Judge not,&#8221; because we don&#8217;t have the information to assess everything about a person.  Isn&#8217;t it possible that someone could be EXAGERATING his or her pain?<br />In Chapter Four, he discusses the nature of creation.  He makes a common mistake, that of equating the creation of Genesis chapters 1 and 2 with the creation in Genesis chapter 3.  Most Christians understand that with the fall of Adam, all of creation was affected.  We obviously are not dealing with Eden here, no matter how beautiful the leaves look in Fall.  Indeed, Fall itself is an evidence of this fall of Adam.  Thing basically went haywire with creations, hence the origins of natural evil.<br />I agree with his assessment in Chapter Five about human freedom, and how misuse of freedom is the cause of moral evil in the world.<br />Well, I didn&#8217;t intend to do a hack job, and I have tried to be as respectful of Rabbi Kushner&#8217;s opinion as I can, while still having integrity with my own beliefs.  This is a knotty issue, and we sometimes wish God would give us better answers.<br />Maybe he has given us the answer, and we don&#8217;t like it.<br />I feel that the ultimate test of this book is how it works in a person&#8217;s life.

Part of the problem is that many of the critics of the Book of Mormon do not have the Mid-East historical, linguistic, or cultural background plus Ph.D. level historical training and experience to do a satisfactory peer-reviewed study and critic of the Book of Mormon.  So what most Book of Mormon critics give instead of substance is heavily footnoted pap and opinion, or they treat the book as you would a Mark Twain novel, completely ignoring the book's truth claims.<br />Dr. Nibley's premise is simple: the Book of Mormon claims to be the product of Mid-East culture-specifically Egyptian and Jewish cultures--so why not analyze the book as you would any other document that claims to be from a similar time period.  It is so simple, it is pure genius!<br />One of the fascinating evidences cited is the name evidence.  Certain names become more popular during different time periods, and the names used in the Book of Mormon correspond to 600 BC.  Along these lines is the name Paanchi, one of the pharaohs of Egypt, and masculine Alma, which appears on a recently discovered document.  Another point he discusses is the word \\"Deseret,\\" which is associated with honeybee worship in Egypt.<br />This is a good read, with no advanced degree in history or special language skills required.  The book of Mormon is one of those few books that people do not have to read to have an opinion, which is sad since so much is available on the book.	2001-11-13

Furthermore, this is a mass-market book designed for members and non-members alike. It is intersting to read the reviews of this book on Amazon.com . . . Most are either one- or fivee-stars. Despite all of this, I hope that the book is reaching people outside the expected audience in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.<br />Presdient Hinckly seems to be following the plan of our Catholic friend, William J. Bennet (\\"The Book of Virtues\\"), who in turn is following the Master. Look closely at the Sermon on the Mount: It doesn't begin with the \\"do's\\" and the \\"dont's,\\" it begins with the Beatitudes, which are virtures. The virtues preceed the rules. I think that PResdient Hinckley is on to something here!<br />Many of the reviews on Amazon.com criticize this book for being simplistic. A very odd criticism. They don't criticize him for being right or wrong, or even practical or impractical, just for being either simple or a hypocrite, which has nothing at all to do with what he says or the nature of his teachings. They never criticize him for being inaccurate, or impossible, but with just bing simplistic. But if the problem has just one cause, why shouldn't the soultion be--not simplistic--but simple? Waht about Occam's Razor and parsiomony.<br />This reminds me of Shakespeare's observation: \\"Simple Truth Miscall'd Simplicity.\\"<br />As to the charge of hypocracy, you shall know a tree by its fruits. Matthew 7:20.<br />Moreover, there is more to President Hinckley than just a certain number of virtures. There is more to the Church of Jesus christ of Latter-day Saints than virtues. LDS Church Presdient Hunter once gave a talk called \\"Ethics Alone is not Sufficient. Presdeint Hinckley is also in favor of conversion, batism, rentention, temples, marriage, and lving the good life as we endure to the end. So much for simplistic!<br />This book is an easy read, and the two appended talks are gems. I hope it is read thoughtfull and prayerfully. No, you will not \\"cathc Mormon\\" if you buy this book, but you will get exposed to the Latter-day Saint view of the Culture War.the two appended talks are gems.

However, despite my denominational differences, I found this book quite a pleasant read.<br />Each generation or so has a champion that articulates truth, and I think Lee Strobel has become one for Christians everywhere.  He pulled a Malcolm Muggeridge, namely he started to investigate Christianity and was later converted to that which he was investigating.<br />C. S. Lewis, himself a recovering atheist, once said, &quot;A young man who wishes to remain a sound Atheist cannot be too careful of his reading.  There are traps everywhere--'Bibles laid open,<br />millions of surprises,' as Herbert says, 'fine nets and sratagems.'  God is, if I may say it, very unscrupulous.&quot; (Surprised by Joy, Chapter 12)<br />Strobel tackles fourteen ferocious questions dealing with the veracity and divinity of Jesus as the Christ.  These fourteen questions fall into three broad categories: I--Examining the Record, to wit the Bible; II--Analyzing Jesus, or the corpus delicti; III--Researching the Resurrection.  For each of the fourteen questions, Strobel interviewed a scholar with expertise in the specific area.  Strobel interrogated the scholars with the type of hardball (but not vacuous doubting)<br />questions you would expect a tough Chicago Tribune reporter to ask.  Despite what Gov. Jesse Ventura thinks, there are strong-minded answers to these sharp and prickly questions. Open-mindedness is a sword that cuts both ways--there is such a thing as BLIND DOUBT that is an opposite to BLIND FAITH.<br />What impressed me the most was that many of the theologians had a hard science background. Drs. Carl Sagan and Steven Hawking, contrawise, do not have any theological or religious<br />degrees.<br />Mr. Strobel has flawless prose, and you can see past the ink and type and see clearly his ideas and the ideas of his interviewees.  The book is logical, ordered, orderly, and absolutely unmuddled. This is a serious book for the serious skeptic and the person who just wonders.<br />ONE PERSONAL INDULGENCE:  In Chapter 5, John McRay, Ph.D., made a comment about my denomination, specifically that the Book of Mormon has no archeological evidence to support it.  This is sheer and utter nonsense.  For example, Immanuel Tov, Dead Sea Scroll Czar, pointed out in a colloquium that the famous Copper Scroll is similar to the gold plates that the Book of Mormon was written on.  Secondarily, the Book of Mormon mentions a place on the Arabian peninsula called &quot;Nahom,' and a place called &quot;Nahem&quot; was found in Arabia.  You do the math.<br />Moreover, there are other evidences beside archeology to support the Book of Mormon, as there are other evidences besides archeology to support Christianity.  See Hugh W.

But his The Life of Our Lord, written in a very personal way, without adornment or flights of fancy, and written for the children he loved, carries with it not only a beautiful narrative but a compelling admonition: 'Remember!--It is Christianity TO DO GOOD always--even to those who do evil to us.'&quot;<br />&quot;Such is the simple telling of a beloved author. In his time and during the generations that have followed, his great novels have been read by millions upon millions. But his story of Jesus' life, written with Dickens's own pen, and without editing of any kind, was for 85 years a family treasure and secret. Printed with all of the editorial mistakes of the original writing, it has delighted many others beyond his family.&quot;<br />President Hinckley, Ensign, December 1994<br />I have heard Pres. Hinckley, world leader of the Church of JEsus Christ of Latter-day Saints, talk about this book, and believing that there is some merit in reading the same books that the president of the Church reads, I picked it up.<br />This book may be considered a follow-up to his immortal classic &quot;A Christmas Carol,&quot; where, instead of an allegory dealing with three spirits working on the Scrooge-of-all-Scrooges, he retells the story of the life of our Lord.<br />The book was geared for his children, so it is a quite easy read. Having read &quot;A Tale of Two Cities,&quot; &quot;Hard Times,&quot; and &quot;A Christmas Carol,&quot; I was impressed with Dickens's flexibility. In fact, it is almost as if we are reading a transcript of a fireside chat. So this book is very readable for anyone of any age. It would be an ideal gift for a child between five and ten years old, or helpful to someone with a learning/reading disability. You could conceivably kill two Goliaths with one stone: get them familiar with the life of the Savior AND expose them to great literature!<br />The only drawback with the book is the theology, but that is understandable since we are of different faiths. Dickens focuses mainly on the ethical aspects of Christ's life, which is good, but incomplete. Another presdeint of the Church of Jesus Christ, President Howard W. Hunter, once gave a talk called, &quot;Ethics Alone is not Sufficient.&quot; If you remember in &quot;A Christmas Carol,&quot; Scrooge makes a conversion to ethical ideal, but not a conversion to Christ. He is going in the right direction, but not far enough. But it is a great book nonetheless.<br />The cover is stellar! It looks as important as its contents. The internal organizing and lay are also up to the stature of the author. It is nice to see that books are returning to their former glory of being both functional and beautiful. It would makes a great gift book, or a beautiful addition to any Postum table.<br />This book had been submerged for a long time due to Dickens's desire to keep his beliefs uncommercialized.

Ansen Dibell not only has an keen eye for plot, but can explain his ideas well.  This book is a technical \\"how-to\\" manual, so it is devoid of any plot, and writing a review of the book is like writing a review of a plumber's training manual.  Unless you are a plumber, you will get bored, and the technical jargon does not lend itself well to review.  I guess the real test is if I get publishes, and the jury is still out on that one . . . so far!<br />Serendipitously speaking, anyone who is a book-hog, devouring books by the megaton, will enjoy this book.  It helps you reverse engineer what you are reading.  For example, in his chapter on literary mirrors, Mr. Dibell uses \\"The Empire Strikes Back\\" as a test study.  Well, I have seen that movie more times than you can shake a stick at and have read the book just as many times, but the analysis that Mr. Dibell made opened my eyes.  \\"The Empire Strikes Back\\" was finally unlocked to me, and became of the analysis provided, I think that \\"Empire\\" is  literary-wise the best film of the second trilogy!<br />The cover is classic-so much of writing feels like a pinball game as you bunce from rejection to rejection, and ricochet from bad idea to bad idea.  Well done!<br />The prose is readable, and the examples he uses are mind-catching.  I am impressed that Mr. Dibell was able to take these ethereal concepts and magic of creativity and bring them down to earth so that someone as stupid I am could understand them!

Lewis book, &quot;The Screwtape Letters,&quot; and &quot;The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe&quot; notwithstanding. This book discusses moral absolutes, and what would happen if we lose the sense of right and wrong.<br />This short book is only three chapters long, but, charachteristically, Lewis says more with one letter than some people say their entire lives.<br />Chapter One discusses MORAL RELATIVISM that is taught in schools, and how the end result of relativism is a dehumanizing process where we become &quot;men without chests,&quot; or hearts, humans without a sense of right and wrong, and therfore no longer humans. You see this idea manifested in the varous Varsity and JV Columbine-style shootings that are now en vogue.<br />Chapte Two discusses this set of moral laws or traditional values, which Lewis calls &quot;the Tao.&quot; The Tao is the source of all value judgements and is the source of &quot;traditional morality.&quot; When people try to change this morality, they are destroying all sense of right and wrong. &quot;The human mind hs no more power of inventing an new [moral] value than of imagining a new primary color.&quot; (p. 56) We need this absolute set of moral laws to survive.<br />Chapter Three discusses the result of not having any absolute values: what happens is that rightness and wrongness is reduced to appetites, &quot;the emotional strength of [the] impuse&quot; (p.57). These is no law, just rampant and renegade emotions controlling everything. There is no sense of fairness, just a &quot;might makes right&quot; law of the jungle, a la Korihor.<br />The one appendix contains illustrations of this moral law from differing civilizations. Memebrs of the Church of Jesus Christ would see the Light of Christ behind all of this.<br />This is a pressing book, and should be read with &quot;1984,&quot; &quot;Brave New World,&quot; &quot;People of the Lie,&quot; and &quot;Slouching Towards Gomorrah&quot; in mind.<br />Three cheers for C.

And beneath this all was an affirmation of mutual respect across culture and time barriers; the sanctity of marriage in society; and the ultimate triumph of good.<br />Mr. Card does a superb job of crafting characters that work within family organizations. As he pointed out in his introduction to &quot;Speaker for the Dead,&quot; most characters in books are free-roaming adolescents that run around solving other peoples problems. (Can you imagine Superman being a bishop? With all those interviews?) Card has a very tight family organization, which reflects how people really operate in the real world. Sherlock Holmes is single, and Watson's wife is a pale shadow of a person.<br />One interesting plot point that Mr. Card does not develop is the importance of childbearing. It is interesting that part of the plot would be predicated on pregnancy. More Mormon family values!<br />This is one of Mr. Card's well-crafted books.

This book is an omnibus of sermons Lewis gave before his death, and provides a nice thumbnail of his thought. It would be a good book to read after \\"Mere Christianity.\\" Two speeches have a sharper edge now: \\"Learning in War-Time,\\" and \\"Why I am Not a Pacifist.\\" In the former, he makes the case that even though we may be at war, we can't drop everything and wait for a \\"perfect peacetime,\\" which will never happen this side of the Millennium. By the way, Lewis served in World War I, and read classics in the trenches.<br />In the latter, he give a long an complicated logical elaboration against pacifism.  President Gordon B. Hinckley, world leader of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints,  summed up pacifism in three sentences: \\"We are people of peace. We are followers of the Christ who was and is the Prince of Peace. But there are times when we must stand up for right and decency, for freedom and civilization, just as Moroni rallied his people in his day to the defense of their wives, their children, and the cause of liberty.\\" (The Times in Which we Live)<br />Several other sermons are &quot;Transposition,\\" which discusses how God may have to use metaphors to speak to us so we can understand. \\"The Inner Ring\\" is British for \\"The Inner Circle\\" and discusses cliques in church. In \\"Membership,\\" Lewis points out that \\"member\\" means \\"organ,\\" as in members or organs of the body of Christ.<br />It is a nice survey of his thought. If you like this book, I would recommend \\"God in the Dock,\\" British for \\"God takes the Stand,\\" or \\"God on Trial,\\" which is another whirlwind omnibus of Lewis's thought. In both of these books, you see the immensity of Lewis's wide-awake mind.	2001-11-10

I am not Roman Catholic, but a memebr of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.  Despite any denominational differences I may have, I am awed by this book.  Considering Aquinas had no computers, no electricity, and no spell-check, he managed to write a lengthy bok that would embarress most Ph.D's with an army of research assistants, expense accounts, and unlimited acess to LEXIS-NEXUS.  Indeed, I belive much criticism of Aquinas comes from ignorance, or a deep-seated admiration and jealousy.<br />This is a standard work of Roman Catholic dogman and philosophical brainwork.  It is a sumation of Catholic theology, systematized and organized.  Aquinas covers several thousand questions relating to Catholic theology and philosophy, provides sharp questions and sound answers to objections.  One of the questions gives a thumb-print of his mind: &quot;Could [God] made the past not to have been?&quot; (ST I-I.25.4)  And Gov. Jesse Ventura said that religious people are weak-minded!  By the way, Aquinas says no, since that would imply a contradiction, which is outsie of God's power.<br />This book and translation also has the &quot;nihil obstant&quot; and &quot;imprimature,&quot; whic is latin for &quot;Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval.&quot;  This translation has passed the Catholic censoring board and can be considered authoriative.<br />The only drawback is it's bulk--and therefore it is a rather awkward book to use.  The internal organization helps to overcome this deficit, but a six volume with a thorough index would help.  Peter Kreeft has a streamiled version of this book called &quot;A Summa of the Summa,&quot; and an even slimmer volume called &quot;A Shorter Summa,&quot; which is a summa of &quot;A Summa of the Summa.&quot;  These smaller books should hep you navigat the large book.<br />The cover is conservative and suits the majesty of the interior contents, and the print and paper are excellent and durable.  The prose is readable, which a laudable since there is a temptation to latinize the English.  This keeps the translation faithful, but makes the book unreadable, and the good Brothers avided this pitfall majestically.<br />As I said, I am not Catholic, but admiration for Aquinas's endeavor *is* universal.  I recommend this book for any hard-core scholar or library aquisitionarian, but for person use, I would recommend Kreeft's excerpts, or Penguin's &quot;Selected Writings&quot; for the undergrad, or ambition high-schooler.ce there is a temptation to latinize the English.

This is a great gift book for your Republican/conservative friends.  It's title tells all--it is a charming little quote book of ideas from our fortieth president.  Biographies by family members are always superior to biographies written by distant observers, and this non-exception proves the rule.<br />It is a great gift book, meaning that it has dainty fonts and stunning pictures.  It is organized topically, but is not indexed so you may have to hunt a little for your favorite quote.  The cover is a nice balance of a thoughtful black and an autumn rust, reminding us that Reagan is in the autumn of his life and slowly heading to black.  However, the cover has a border of gold remind us of the gold ofg life after death.<br />We need politicians with wit--Kennedy and Reagan both had the Irish blarney, but the silver-tounge seems to be scarce among the current chain-gang in Congress. This book should be a manditory study gude.  We need to eradicate the superficial smashmouth so common on the Sunday shows!<br />Favorite Quotes:<br />\\"Government's view of the economy could be summed up in a few short phrases: If it moves, tax it.  If it keeps moving, regulate it.  And if it stops moving, subsidize it.\\" (p. 111)<br />\\"What American needs is a spiritual renewal and reconciliation-firt man with God, and then man with man.\\" (p. 75)<br />\\"Since I came to the White House, I've gotten two hearing aids, had a colon operation, a prostate operation, skin cancer, and I've been shot.

This omnibus is destined to be the standard work on Trumanistic though for years to come. Each of these five books is a gold mine in it own right, but uniting the sticks of thought so that the become one in our hands and in our minds is sheer brilliance.<br />Dr. Truman Madsen needs no introduction, and like Hugh Nibley, or George Durrant has become a non-General Authority authority on matters of theology and all things Mormon. This man has a steel mind, but speaks with a soft voice, and this gentle tone carries over into his prose. I cannot say enough about this nice man who is also nice in person&#8211;I held the door open for him once at the BYU Library.

THIS IS A MUST FOR ANY HIGH-SCHOOL OR COLLEGE STUDENT WITH QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT IS BEING TAUGHT IN THEIR SECULAR SCHOOL! You almost need a survey of philosophy class to understand this book, but the eager and industrious of any level can be rewarded with reading it.<br />After you read this book, get a copy of Dr. Madsen&#8217;s cassettes &#8220;Timeless Questions, Gospel Insights,&#8221; which rounds out his thought and brings the scholarship up to date.<br />FOUR ESSAYS ON LOVE: This alludes to C. S. Lewis&#8217;s &#8220;The Four Loves,&#8221; but attacks the question with the tools of the Restoration. Dr. Madsen discusses the sources of love, how to love and be loved (an essay on romantic/erotic love), Love at home, and tackles Human Anguish and Divine love. Not just for infatuated teenagers!<br />CHRIST AND THE INNER LIFE, THE HIGHEST IN US, and THE RADIANT LIFE are collections of speeches, talks and devotionals that Dr. Madsen has given over the years.

First of all, I am not Roman Catholic, but a memeber of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, so I have a bias--in the other direction!<br />However, my denominational difference does not diminish my burning admiration for this theological Godzilla.  Gov. Jesse Ventura once commented that religion was for weak-minded people.  I don't think &quot;The Body&quot; could last two rounds against &quot;The Dumb Ox.&quot;  In fact, I would prefer Aquinas over Socrates, Plato, and Aristoltle . . . combined!<br />This book is the best survey of this Catholic's corpulent corpus of comentary.  Included are ample slices of the Summa Contra Gentile and Summa theologica, including selections from his essays on Law and Happiness.  Another gem is a selection from Aquinas's comments on Boethius's &quot;On The Trinity.&quot;<br />The selections cross the time and space of Aquinas's life, but morte importantly you get a cross-secton of his thought on everything.<br />I would reccomed this book to any good Catholic, or any curious non-Catholic.  It is also useful for philosophy students, and honest truth-seekers everywhere.<br />ONLY ONE MISTAKE: Ralph McInerny left out &quot;The Five Ways&quot; of the proof of God's existence.

Mr. Chesterton wrote a charming overview of the Dumb Ox, one of the smarterst men ever!  This book is more like several postcard close-ups than a panaorama of the life of Aquinas.  It inclused several humorous anecdotes of Aquinas'a life, and two of his greatest experiences in life.  The first what when he was in deep mediations and was given the Solomon Question--&quot;I will give you a blank check, what do you want?&quot;  How did he answer this question?  The second event centers around Aquinas's writing of the Summa Theologica, wher he caimed to have a vision from God that made everything that he had ever written look like straw.  Some he saw ground his mind to a standstill.<br />I felt a kinship to Aquinas, a great man with a great mind who could have been anything and everything, but chose to be a monk.

Indeed, you know a classic by how many times it has been ripped off, or alluded to in pop culture. In fact, the star Trek franchise's motto is when in doubt; either have a time travel episode, a Borg episode, or rip-off Moby-Dick. See episodes from the original series &quot;Obsession,&quot; and movies &quot;The Wrath of Khan,&quot; and &quot;First Contact&quot; and &quot;The Voyage Home&quot;<br />Test: What's the opening line of Moby-Dick? &quot;Call me Ishmael.&quot;<br />So why the four starts for a classic? Basically, because Melvin threw in too much exposition in explaining cetology and zoology, which is helpful in getting a feel for the book, but contributes nothing to the brooding Ahab's story.  You get snippets here and there of Ahab's monomania, but it is only in the last several chapters that he blooms from being a poor addled man to a diabolic and satanic force of evil.  Baptizing the spear in the name of the devil is what does it!<br />But do we need to slog through 135 chapters, plus an appendix to get to the point.  In reality this book is about the milieu of whaling and the whaling industry as a metaphor for life, not monomania as is popularly believed.  He does a wonderful job of catching the salt and blood associated, and his poetic eye catches the glisten of meaning with these events, but he is doing several things at once, and the quest for the whale is only part of the story.<br />But these cetology matters should have been relegated to an appendix, or the circular file. It was as if Melville was trying to write two books at once: a bouncy book on various whales and whaling in general, and a another being the tale of obsession and revenge. My advice would be to get an abridge version of the book, or skip to the next chapter when the book gets boring.<br />So what is the appeal? First, Ahab is a strong character with a smoldering motive to get back at the whale that cost him his leg-i.e. Captain Hook. Does he ever get back at the wale? Are we ever Ahab-esque in that we get obsessed with revenge? Come on! Be honest! We feel Ahab burning in our veins at times.<br />Ahab is crazy.  Hannibal Lecter is crazy.  But they are crazy for different reasons.  You feel that Lecter is really in control of himself, and that he enjoys being evil whereas Ahab has surrendered his will to he appetite and passion for revenge.  What wraps my attention is the question why.<br />Second, the craft. Melville is a master storyteller. We see things through Ishmael's eyes, so we feel the distance between Ahab and us. We are detached from the goings on in the story as Ishmael comments on Ahab's journey downward. It must be read to be understood.<br />Third, the milieu. Melville certainly did his homework in researching this novel. Indeed, chapter one seems like a brainstorm on all things whale, and he manages to sustain this encyclopedic knowledge throughout the story.  Compare this to Jack London and The Sea-Wolf: London has as much technical knowledge, or more so than Melville, but the Sea-Wolf focuses on the characters Humphrey Van Weyden and Wolf Larsen and the idea of a Neitzchean Superman. Moby-Dick, however, is a study of the whaling milieu and the smudge pot Ahab. London skimps on the description of seal hunting &quot;culture,&quot; and the nuts and bolts of sailing while Melville revels in telling us everything about whaling. This exposition is what kills the book because the plot grinds to a standstill as Melville throws cetological tidbits and tales at us.  It is fun to read, but the plot momentum stops dead.  It is almost like seeing an infomercial in the middle of the book! Luckily we can skip ahead, unlike reality where we cannot fast-forward commercial.<br />This book is part of a trio that deals with evil captains, the other books being Jack London's &quot;Sea-Wolf,&quot; and Jules Verne's &quot;20,000 Leagues under the Sea.&quot; Nemo is just as driven as Ahab, but is more mysterious.We understand Ahab's revenge, since we have all tried to chase down people who have hurt us, or wanted to get back at a barking dog, or barking spouse. That is the appeal-we relate to Ahab better than Nemo, who is cerebral, cold, distant and obscure.<br />Wolf Larsen is another matter. He belongs in the Villain's Hall of Fame, or is it the Rogue's Gallery? Pure evil, a pure manifestation of &quot;intelligence . . . added to brute power and evil will&quot; (Inferno, 31) that was never matched or equaled until Thomas Harris created Hannibal Lecter. Ahab is obsessed and we understand why someone wants revenge, but Larsen is terrifying in that he enjoys being evil. I just wish that Larsen would get more exposure.<br />So in a knot, I recommend this book, but advise people to feel free in skipping over the unnecessary chapter, or buying an abridged version. Read &quot;20,000 Leagues&quot; and &quot;The Sea-Wolf&quot; to nail down the image of an evil captain.<br />FOR ANYONE WRITING A REPORT: This story is a tale of &quot;Man Versus Nature&quot; embodied by the whale. Read Genesis 16-17,21, 25, 28 and 1 Kings 16, 18, 20-22 for Ishmael and Ahab. Aren't I kind!s.

This is an obscure work in London's corpus, but I'm not sure why.  Probably due to his socialistic politcs.  This book was doomed to die in the 1950's, but it has survived.<br />This tale comes under &quot;speculative fiction,&quot; to wit, Mr. London wiriting in 1910's specualtes about the rise of a Captialistic State and the ubermensch who deigns to overthrow it and establish a Communist Regime.  CATCH: the story is told from the point of view of the superman's Lois Lane lover.  Imagine, a man's man Jack London assuming the voice of a woman!  But that is part of the thrill and appeal of this tiny book.  He charachterizes the milieu perfectly.  You can breathe the air of anticipation in his letters and syntax.<br />He speculated about a communist revolution in the United states, several years before Red October, and many decades before the Velvet Revolutions of 1989.  So he was dead wrong on many things, but he was right in several edge-areas, and these small bulls-eyes kept me going!<br />He is best in communicating the emotion and anticipation of whous could possibly happen if such a revolution did occur.  And I think that is part of the book's charm.  Read this along-side &quot;1984,&quot; &quot;Brave New World/Brave New World Revisited,&quot; and &quot;Brazil.&quot; This book will help triangualte your ideas.

So, it is only good if you are 1) curious about the first edition, 2) a hard-core quote-ophile, or 3) cheap, like I was.<br />This book is not a complete waste, and I didn't return it, since it does have some uses, such as for casual browsing, a cheap gift to an ex or in-law, or even as a bathroom book.<br />(I can't believe that we have a word for such books!)<br />The draw backs to this book are that there is no order to the quotes.  He starts out with obvious Shakespeare, but everything else is somewhere between haphazard and helter-skelter.  Most of the sections are lines from long-forgotten poems that were old in Bartlett's day.  There is also no index.  Craziness!  But probably industry standard in the 1800's.<br />The cover is very bland--white, with the the title in black and Brady Bunch Orange.  Nice conservative colors, such as deep blues or greens, with a marble frame-border would help this book out.<br />So, if you want a cheap gift or a mediocre/next to useless quote-book, buy this book.  But if you want the Bartlett's you grew up with, get the expensive hardbound.	2001-10-28

The Simpsons is the longest running prime time show.  Look what it has out-lasted--Cosby, Home Improvement, and Seinfeld.  There is something to the Show, and the Groening humor.<br />This book is necessary because the Simpsons is a cultural phenomenon on the level of the Beatles, Elvis, or Star Wars.  This is an &quot;essential&quot; for anyone understanding pop culture.<br />This is also great primer for philosophy, along the lines of &quot;The Metaphysics of Star Trek: Is Data Human?&quot;  The genius lies in taking the familiar antics of the Springfieldians and showing there is a method and reason to their madness and rhyme.  Indeed, all we do is based in our personal philosophy.  And, yes, the decision to ignore philosophy is itself a philosophical decision!<br />The tone of the essays is very casual and conversational, and jargon is non-existant.  An easy read for high-schoolers, or ambitious junior high students.<br />When we look at the Simpsons, we look at ourselves, and that is the point of all philosophy.<br />The only complaint I have is that illustrations would have been helpful, not just the Springfieldians, but the philosophic powerhouses that check in on the Simpsons.	2001-10-28

This books allows to go inside Lucas's mind as he was developing the Star Wars universe.  The first thing you notice is that the hexalogue or nonalogue was not planned out in millimeter as many people suppose.  Lucas went through the normal development anyone else would go through.  For example, Lucas didn't decide on making Darth Vader Luke's father, until the fourth draft of Empire.  Ant that is a very significant item of plot!<br />This book is trivided among the three films, beginning with excerpts from the early drafts Lucas wrote, then the screenplay is presented with the Special Edition line highlighted by grey.  Throughout the script, there are italicized comments about how the story changed or was modified from the original draft.<br />This book is not up to quote-unquote scholarly levels of historical precision, but that does not mean it is absolutely useless.  It is quite a fun book,a nd you can win many arguments about Lucas with this book!<br />You want to read this book along side of Joseph Cambell's &quot;Hero with a Thousand Faces,&quot; to see where Lucas is getting his mythological ideas.<br />The best tidbits are the ideas Lucas scrapped, and later reused in the other films.  But you will have to read that on your own!	2001-10-28

We are all up to speed on Lucas, so this is more of an overview of the second trio of the Star Wars hexalogue.<br />Lucas's genius is his abilitly to have a science fiction story with a strong fantasy feel to it.  Frank Herbert did this in his Dune series, and Aykroyd and Ramis did it in Ghostbusters.  For some reason, infusing sci-fi with fantasy gives the story more power than a strictly sci-fi or strictly fantasy book would otherwise have.  And for some reason, putting sci-fi into fantasy doesn't work.<br />These stories cannot be ignored--the Star Wars phenomenon is as big as the Beatles and Elvis, and indeed Lucas's greatest contributions was the wake he made.  Every current sci-fi project, be it film, novel, or TV stands in Lucas's shadow.  The revitalized Star Trek franchise is alive becasue of Lucas.<br />Really, before Star Wars, the only sci-fi out there was Star Trek reruns, or the cartoon, and the &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot; franchise.  &quot;2001&quot; was made in 1968, and was 10 years dead by the time Lucas came around.<br />The influence of Lucas can not be underestimated!<br />Specifically, this omnibus preserves the introductory material of Star Wars, with the long prologue that talks about Senator Palpatine from the &quot;Journal of the Whills,&quot; and Leia's quip about the heroes being in the wrong place at the wrong time.  Essential backgound material!<br />The font is easy to read, the print is firm and black, and I could see no typos!  That is quite an accomplishment considering some of the gaffes I have seen in other books.  The cover art is appropriate, since the first trio of stories, as we are leaning, are about Anakin.  The whole hexalogue is about the rise, fall, and redemption of Anakin Skywalker.  So we need this looming Darth Vader on the cover.  It also calls back the bealtemania-esque frenzy that Star Wars caused!<br />The only thing that I would like to see is the introductory essays that Lucas wrote for the re-issued books printed here.<br />May the Force be with you!inted here.<br />May the Force be with you!	2001-10-28

It's all here!	The Ugly Duckling.  The Little Mermaid.  The Tinderbox.  The Emperor's New Clothes.  The Princess and the Pea.  It's all here!<br />C. S. Lewis, in his preface to \\"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe,\\" observed that as children we grow out of hearing fairy tales, but as an adult we can come back to them with fresh eyes and be enchanted in a different way.  HCA stories have that amphibian quality of living above and below the supposed age limits.<br />I find it surprising that HCA writing in a minor language would be so popular, but he is a genius at writing fairy tales.  The Grimm Boys just collected and edited the German fairy tales, but HCA was generating new and original fairy tales.  I hope we don't sluff off this unique talent he had solely on the ground that he was writing to children.  After all, how many naked Emperors have we seen?  The comic Dilbert gets it's life blood from the fact that so many emperors can be smooth-talked by so many charlatans, and be sustained in their delusion by smarmy sycophants, and only brought to light by a child.<br />If children can understand this, why can't we adults?<br />On the printing-side of the book, I would like to see this in a hardbound, with durable paper, and not the thin and fragile newsprint.  I am almost afraid to read this book since the opaper is so delicate!	2001-10-22

Memebers of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints belive in modern prophets, with Gordon B. Hinckley being a modern, living prophet now in this time of war.<br />There is a scriture that the Church of Jesus Christ believe apllies to these prophets and to members of the that church:<br />&quot;Wherefore, meaning the church, thou shalt give heed unto all his words and commandments which he shall give unto you as he receiveth them, walking in all holiness before me; For his word ye shall receive, as if from mine own mouth, in all patience and faith. For by doing these things the gates of hell shall not prevail against you; yea, and the Lord God will disperse the powers of darkness from before you, and cause the heavens to shake for your good, and his name's glory.&quot; D&amp;C 21:4-6<br />Like most people, I bought the book on the strength of the author, and because he has a singular calling in the Church.<br />The cover is a nice puffy one, similar to those used on President Boyd K. Packer's &quot;Memorable Stories&quot; series, and has similar relaxing images that you would fin in a &quot;Deep Thoughts&quot; book, or other inspirational literature. So the book comes off being very unimposing, and hopefully will catch the eyes of less active or non members who are searching. I like the color scheme of black, white and gold!<br />Each page corresponds to a day of the year, and has a scripture from one of the four standards works, and a quote from President Hinckley's corpulent corpus of counsel. So we really cannot go wrong with the format or the message.<br />This is an interesting attempt to put the Prophet's words in a daily devotional book. For whatever reasons, Latter-day Saints have not caught on to using &quot;daily devotional&quot; books, probably because the counsel has always been to read the scriptures. Or as Elder McConkie Said, Don't drink below the horses.&quot; There have been several other devotional books compiled; however, this is the first time in this dispensation that the words of the living President of the Church have been used as the text. We shal have to see how this catches on, and if a precedent for future presidents of the Church is being made.<br />I have two Protestant devotionals, C. S.

Shopworn Conventions, and Outdated Archetypes	Books	5	1	2	N	N	Serious humor!	This is half review and half testimonial.  First the testimonial.<br />My enjoyment of movies had increased tenfold because of this book.  Being primarily visual, I<br />love movies and TV as media, but after tasting the Classics (Shakespeare, Tolstoy, etc), I realize<br />how bad much of the visual media are in their story-telling.  This book gives a name and a<br />definition to my disgust and oftentimes boredom with movies.  In fact, when a movie gets<br />REALLY bad, I grab this book and try and find how many of the cliches are in the movie, a type<br />of \\"Roadside Travel Bingo.\\"  I can turn a bad movie around by laughing at its silly conventions.<br />This book has become even more useful in the drought of decent films!  Why do you think so<br />many cinemas are closing?  It's not due to Cable or Dishes, they have been around since the<br />1970's; and it's not due to the VCR, which came out in the `80s, or due to DVDs, which is just a<br />disc form of a VHS-tape, but do to bad films.  This book should be required reading in<br />Hollywood!  It just might help them, and we would all benefit.<br />*<br />This book is a handy hand-held hand reference guide to \\"movie cliches, stereotypes, obligatory<br />scenes, hackneyed formulas, shopworn conventions, and outdated archetype.\\"  It is a spin-off of<br />Mr. Ebert's (you know--the short, fat one who is still alive) decades long career as a movie critic.<br />If you are a cinemaholic, in the back of you mind you wonder if the critics ever get bored of going<br />to movies.  This book answers the question.<br />It is a \\"glossary,\\" so like a dictionary and an encyclopedia, it just contains entries and<br />explanations, so don't complain if this has no plot.  The formart is alphabetical, so the trick is in<br />remembering the title of the observation.<br />The illustrations are a hoot!  They are old 18th Century engravings that illustrate selected entries.<br />Just the contrast of the engravings to the captions is hilarious.  Old Fogies like me who remeber<br />\\"The Peter Principle,\\" know where this idea came from!<br />BONUS: There are four (4) appendices in this book: a hand-held list of cliche's that has floated<br />around the Internet for some time, O'Donnell's Laws of Cartoon Motion (ie Wile E. Coyote vs.<br />Roadrunner) , Matty's Creature Ferocity Index, and A Cynic's Guide to the Language in Film<br />Festival Catalogue Descriptions by Doug Sanders. (I think David Manning, the non-existent<br />movie critic for the Ridgefield Press used some of these!)<br />The drawbacks to this book are:<br />1) Size.  I want more! More! MORE!<br />2) The tiles of the various cliches are humorous gags, but sometimes it is difficult to fine a specific<br />cliche<br />Examples:<br /> \\"Death is Wet: Every single morgue in a movie uses dripping or running water on the sound<br />track.\\" (p. 48)\\"<br />\\"Paint and Sufferink: Violent scenes in a G-rated animated feature which would have been<br />guaranteed the film at leat a PG if it had been shot in live-action.\\"<br />\\"Little Man Big Man Rule: Whenever one character is tall and the other short and plump, the<br />short one is always the brains and the tall one is the dummy.  See Home Alone, etc.\\"<br />This is classic material, but it is hard to find a cliche because you have to remember the title!  One<br />way to fix the problem would be to use the method in Roget's Thesaurus and assign every idea a<br />number and then crosse-reference the number.<br />3) There is no index, which would help with the above problem.<br />4) There is some repetition of jokes, such as the \\"Gentleman Villain\\" cliche (p.77) and \\"Roll<br />Over, Beethoven\\" (p. 167), and \\"Wash and Wax Rule\\" (p. 207).  There may be a way to combine<br />all of these observations in to a Grand Unified Theory of Bad Movies.<br />A PARTING THOUGHT: Any aspiring writers-be it fiction, sci-fi, fantasy, drama, neo-<br />Shakespeare, or what have you- should memorize this book.  Several time I have thought myself<br />clever, but Ebert demolished me!ished me!	2001-10-21

There is something to this story, but I'm at a loss as to what it is.  Misery loves company, maybe. Part of the problem is that I am not sure what Kafka's metaphor is representing. The closest thing I can see is someone getting into a crippling accident, and the family getting alientated by all the care they have to give to the relative.  Image what Christopher Reeves' family is going though right now since he is paralyzed.<br />I will meet Kafka's Gregor Samsa with Tolstoy's Platon Karatayev from \\"War and Peace\\".  Platon (Plato?) was a prisoner of the French during their invasion of Moscow in 1813.  Instead of curling up into a ball, Platon always busied himself in helping other prisoners.  In other words, he was a prefiguring of Victor Frankel in Auschwitz.  Tolstoy said that Platon was like a large ball of light who expanded, then disappeared.<br />We may undergo a physical change, such as paralysis, or the slow march of old age, but our soul is immortal.  It stays the same, and never ages.  This body is vile and will be worm-food soon enough.  But the soul is differnt.  We change out own soul.  The bug-man Samsa still had his soul, though stuill a bug, as Platon still had his his free soul, though still a prisoner.<br />Although I think this book may really be about Samsa's family (a dimesnion of change that Ovid missed), and not the bug-man!  I'm still the same person weather I'm wearing a red shirt or a blue shirt, or have one arm or two arms, coiffed or bald.  I only change if I sell my soul, or perfect my soul!  That is the REAL change and metamorphasis!<br />A rather distasteful slice of nihilistic pie.	2001-10-21

However, I am not of K's tradition, so this is an outsider's look at Mr. K's philosophy.<br />I am quite impressed with what Mr. K has to say.  It took me a while to get into his style of speaking and writing, but one I picked up his dialect, I was awestruck!  Sometimes titles not only grab you, but mesmerize you. His essay \\"Sickness unto Death,\\" which I had heard of in passing, was one of these titles that I just could not get out of my head.<br />The advantage of this compilation is that it is done by the General Editors of the \\"Collected Works of S. K.,\\" so the translation, pagination and diction are all the same in the individual books and this small hors d'oeuvre plate.  Having used various translations of Machiaveli, or different editions of Plato, it is nice to have one standard translation.<br />I recommend book as a being like a \\"Best of Kierkegaard,\\" much like a \\"Best of\\" CD from an unknown band.

This was the second most copied book during the Middle Ages, after the Bible.<br />Why?<br />Partly due to its twiggy size, but beyond that, there is something to what Boethius writes.  C. S. Lewis forwarded this book to me in the Twenty-seventh Screwtape Letter, in the context of a discussion about evil in the world and God's Omnipotence.  Seems like we are still having the same argument a thousand years later.  Nihil Novi Sub Sola-there is nothing new under the sun!<br />In this allegory, the half-pagan, half-Christian Boethius discusses with Wisdom personified why he is imprisoned unjustly, and to a broader extent, how an all powerful, all loving God lets evil happen to humans.  Tangential to this is a discussion of freedom of the will and God's omniscience.<br />The genius of this book, therefor, is to be able to slim-down the discussion into five smaller parts, and then to say something substantive on the issue.  The last phase it to be correct with what you say, and that is the rub!<br />Though I am not part of this religious tradition, I think Boethius came up with a good explanation, but I am not sure if it true or not.  The stork explains where babies come from, but it is not correct.  But that does not make this book any worse for reading or for enjoyment or food for thought.  Besides, you have to admire his effort in tackling this tough issue.  Personally, I agree with Ezra Taft Benson who said at some point everyone is backed up to the wall of faith and there we must take our stand.<br />Yes faith can, is, and will be abused by the evil; and no, I don't think faith is crutch-- any more than I believe that doubt is a crutch to the skeptic.  But this book is a tale of a struggle of one man's faith in the face of a bludgeoning club.  Indeed, prison literature, such as the Rev. Martin Luther King's letter from Birmingham Jail, John the Baptist in Herod's dungeon Joseph Smith's Epistles from Liberty Jail, is some of the most sublime writing ever!  You feel Boethius's passionate spirit expand beyond the wall of his cell and fill the whole mediaeval world.ethius's passionate spirit expand beyond the wall of his cell and fill the whole mediaeval world.	2001-10-21

This is a wonderful book that cuts across so many axes: autobiography, poli sci, US history-<br />1980's, US history-1970's, the Soviet Union, the Carter Administration, the Reagan<br />Administration, Reagan the man, Reagan the leader, Regan the economist, and so forth.<br />So--where to begin?<br />The lion's share of this book is devoted to Reagan's radio roar, growl and comment on the state of the Union in the late 1970's. It is not just politics and policies, but general cultural issues as well. You are given a view into the Reaganite philosophy as he deals with economics, the Federal relationship, welfare reform, inflation (remember it was double-digit in the 1970's), and, of course, the Soviet Union.<br />What you read are the rough drafts of the radio commentaries, so don't expect a neat and tidy book. If you are looking for a &quot;Reagan Bible&quot; so to speak, then get a copy of &quot;Speaking My Mind.&quot; A good quote book was compiled by his son, Michael, in &quot;The Common Sense of an Uncommon Man.&quot; It would nice to se a cleaned up version of this book, which would appeal to a broader audience.<br />This book whets my appetite for a better collection of Reagan speeches, say even a total corpus of<br />Ronald Regan's Papers. Face it: be he hero or villain, Ronald Reagan deserves due credit for his rightly-called &quot;Reagan Revolution.&quot; He deserves study and emulation. He even deserves a place on Mount Rushmore, if it were possible.<br />The index of speeches is tops! It is both readable and useful, and gives us the heads of the speeches to see where his mind was going. After all, the most important thing about a man is not his sex, skin color, place of birth, or party affiliation, but his mind. And as Reagan's mind is slowly being wasted by Alzheimer's, we are all worse off.<br />In addition to his speeches, this book has some of Regan's early fiction from his teen and college years, and a wonderful poem! Then ends on his farewell Alzheimer's announcement.<br />The drawback of the book is that is NOT a complete collection of his comments and it is not in chronological order, so when Reagan alludes to a previous speech, we have to hunt and peck for something we may never find. I realize life can be like this, but the book should not be.<br />One last note: the cover really captures something about Reagan. As the introductory essay indicates, Reagan wrote these himself. He was not only well read and well spoken, but well thought. He used no speech writer for these commentaries. The &quot;ivory-tower&quot; intelligencia despised him. Probably because he did so well without them.

This is an interesting book, which I bought on the strength of its author's name.  It is almost a companion piece to &quot;War and Peace,&quot; another pacifism book.  The reviews so far extensively cover the content of the book.  I will include some criticisms.<br />1)  We need to keep in mind the Russian word &quot;Mir,&quot; as in the ex-space station.  &quot;Mir&quot; can be translated as &quot;peace&quot; or &quot;community.&quot;  As Tolstoy explains the progression of society, he begins with the individual-animal, then the state-pagan, and finally the world (ch. IV).  So &quot;World Peace&quot; can be translated as &quot;World Community.\\"  This idea is an expression of the Russian language.<br />2) Tolstoy is an advocate of a radical pacifism to the point on non-intervention when others are being affected by evil (p. 33-34).  In other words, America should not have stopped Hitler.  That idea is worse than Nazism itself!<br />3) Tolstoy inadvertently makes the \\"Self Inclusion Fallacy,\\" the technical name for when someone criticizes someone else for doing something that he himself is doing-in psychology it is called projection. The specific error he makes is that he relies on the Bible for his brand of pacifism, and criticizes others for going beyond the bounds of the Bible for their brand of pacifism (34).  Well, Tolstoy's own argument is also not found in the Bible-if it was, why then write the book? It is the same mistake Martin Luther made: \\"Sola Scriptora\\" is itself unscriptural.<br />4) Tolstoy also makes the mistake of citing a few scriptures as the basis of his philosophy.  He reduces the sixty-six books of the Bible to a few verses, and is therefore playing a one key piano.  His philosophy is more like an elaborate slogan or bumper-sticker.  Dr. Boyd K. Packer observed that any virtue pushed to an extreme becomes a vice.  So, any truth pushed to an extreme becomes a lie.<br />5) C. S. Lewis warned about a hyphenated Christianity, called \\"Christianity And.\\"(Screwtape Letters, ch. 25).  Tolstoy advocates a \\"Christianity AND the Peace Movement.\\"  What happens is Christianity gets politicized and reinterpreted in terms of the minor suffix, and eventually the major prefix of Christianity is lost.  Look at the Crusades; we can sin in the opposite direction.<br />6) Tolstoy's reliance on scriptures only works if you believe the Bible.<br />7) Honestly--who really IS for war?  Just the bullies and the people of Evil.  Possibly the arms makers.  Maybe the generals and admirals.  But out of normal people, who is for war?  In light of the World Trade Center calamity, many people are for defense and justice.  Tolstoy sees no distinction between defense, justice, and war.  The book presupposes that there is an inclination for war among people.  I concede that at the heart of every war is a philosophical question, but Tolstoy never discussed the drives or appetite for war in man.  James 4:1.<br />Read this book with M.

At some point the great literature and words reach out and touch us to the very core of our being, that special spark that is real you.  The Lusiads has done that to me.<br />Being written in a minor tongue and focusing on a minor nation's history, this rhyming wall of words has not had much circulation out side of the lusophonic orbit, which is a shame.  This work deserves its proper place behind the Iliad, The Odyssey, the Aeneid, and the Divine Comedy.  This English translation enables anglophonics to understand Camoes, the Portuguese Shakespeare.<br />Unlike the Aeneid, which focuses on one mans journey from Troy to Rome, this story focuses on the Portuguese in the plural as a collective people.  It celebrates their special history, using Vasco Da Gama's 1497 voyage to India as the focus of drama.<br />The only drawback to the book is that you need to read a survey of Portuguese history and geography to savor this book.  I lived in Portugal for two years, therefor I understood the allusions and the story.  It is not, however, as bad as the Divine Comedy where almost every paragraph is foot-noted, but a perusal of the encyclopedia would help before, during, and after the reading.<br />Lastly, I have read the Lusiads in Portuguese.  Since it is written in poetic form with cantos, and in a second tongue, it was grueling work.  I can only compare it to reading Milton or Pope in another language.  Poetry by nature is dense writing, and if the reader is also dense, trouble occurs.  Therefore, I endorse this English translation to mono- and polyglots alike.	2001-09-15

This is being written two days after the World Trade Center/Pentagon attacks. It behooves every American to become familiar with the man who will fight the first war of the Twenty-First Century. We need to rally around our President and give him support.<br />This book lets us see his soul--his wild days sewing wild seeds, his days in oil, his days in baseball, and finally his days in politics and his days as a reborn Christian.<br />The title of the book comes from that old hymn, &quot;A Charge to Keep I Have,&quot; written by Charles Wesley. He candidly admits he had wild days in the book, but he has become reborn in Christ. Definitely not a Bible thumper, his faith permeates all he does. Notice the Bible verses in his addresses.<br />President Bush is not a systematic philosopher, like Hobbes, Locke, or Aquinas. He is however, one of the common men with common sense like President Reagan who had an understanding of men and the way the world works. Here and there you discovere great one-lines that capture his thought-gems. He is not only a man of principle, but a man of principles and precepts.<br />I only wish we had the complete transcripts of his speeches, but that is a book for another day, eight years away.<br />We have stern days ahead of us. This book acquaints us with the man, his philosophy and his faith, which will win the battles we have to fight.	2001-09-14

Good move!<br />This is not sci-fi, but fantasy, with some science thrown in.  I enjoyed the outroness of the book: female author, female lead, Afro-centric, several centuries ago.  It is nice to have my mind stretched in other directions, not just Beowulf or Arthurian legends.<br />I found this book odd in this sense:  the story did not accost me, but I was so interested in the story that I couldn't put it down.  I finished it the day I bough it.  This is quite a compliment to the authoress!<br />It is an interesting premise, and I had shades of Joseph Campbell in my mind. The male image is a ghost who passes from body to body, while the female is quite fixed to her mutable body.  They change bodies, but one is like a hermit crab, the other is like Clayface from Batman comics.<br />She makes an interesting choice of images: the female with the changeable body who focuses on her children and family.  The man is more ghost than Patrick Swayze, who is a destroyer-killer who possesses people, and is prolific in progeny.  These are Butler's archetypes of male and female.  It is an interesting position to take on explaining the genders!<br />There were only three hang-ups.  First, Butler got quite ingenious and exquisite with the variations on sex.<br />The second hangup I had was Anyanwu's moral code or philosophy.  she seemed to be quite free and loose with everything, except Doro's killings, and eating milk.  Doro's killings, however, are of a slightly different nature than your textbook homicide.  He can't help himself.  He can intentionally &quot;posses&quot; other people, but the possession happens even if he doesn't want it to happen.  It is beyond his control, so he is therefore inculpable.  In fact, he is virtuous in that he sometimes tries to sublimate or direct this power of his.<br />Second, milk.  Anyanwu only gets adamant about eating milk products.  Although this adds to the outroness of the book, it is a rather odd thing to get so adamant about.  She fornicates, is an enabler to Doro, changes into a dolphin and has calfs in this form, etc.  But milk is the only hang up.  Why?<br />The last hangup is the prognostication.  Anyanwu seems to know everything about current science.  She cuts her Fallopian tubes, understands germ theory, understands DNA and cloning, and she even makes penicillin.  One or two of these would be fine, but Butler over did it.utroness of the book, it is a rather odd thing to get so adamant about.

[[VIDEOID:65df3b8a15ff897abfbcef8817599157]]This is a wonderful translation. The language is luscious, and engaging. For those of us who waded through R. K. Gordon's verbal quicksand, this new translation is pure liberty.<br /><br />For readers of Shakespeare, Tolkien, or Scott, the language at times can be a hindrance to the plot and themes of the story. It took me three readings of Macbeth to finally fall in love with the play. Heany's translation liberates the story from the text and makes it fresh for the 21st Century.<br /><br />Two observations. First, This is a translation, not a transliteration, so of course the words do not have a one-to-one word or letter correspondence. For example, Heaney renders &quot;Beowulf I&quot; (son of Sheilf Sheafson/Scyld-Scefing)as &quot;Beow.&quot; The main reason is so we do not confuse him with Beowulf II, the protagonist. That is a fair translating call.<br /><br />Moreover, read the introductory essay (p. xxvii-xxviii) where, Heaney explains why he translates &quot;Hwaet&quot; as &quot;So.&quot; The translator's job is to rewrite the ideas in the new language. If you can retain the poetry of the mother tongue, fine, if not, it is secondary to the job.  The Carlyle-Okey-Wicksteed is almost a transliteration, and is rough reading since they are so loyal to the mother text. Heaney, however, takes normal liberties in translation, and so he takes an Old English classic and makes it a Modern English classic.<br /><br />Secondly, we need more poet-translators, who can savor the subtleties of both languages and can enliven a text to a new audience.  Heaney has held up his light; let others follow.	2001-09-01

I have not felt so strong about a book since I read Orson Scott Card's &quot;Xenocide&quot; . Incredible.<br />This is a layered book: The tensions between the royal houses; the tensions between the houses and the Spice Guild; the tensions between the patriarch and the shadow matriarchy of the Bene Gesserits. You you are looking at a real world!<br />In fact, this book is AS complex as &quot;Lord of the Rings,&quot; but does not have Tolkien's archaic quasi-Middle English. Herbert's prose is smooth. The only down side is that I had to return to the index to check on the unfamiliar words. I'm glad Herbert put that index in there: although they are humans, this is an alien world and an alien culture.<br />Herbert's genius is, however, his ability to meld Sci-Fi and Fantasy into that rare elixir of &quot;Sci-Fant.&quot; Look at &quot;Star Wars&quot; and the Force, or even Ghostbusters where you catch ghosts not by magic but by technology. Chief among the fantasy elements is the Melange, the Spice, the macguffen. Another element is the Bene Gesserit &quot;witches,&quot; that secretly are controlling the destiny of humanity.<br />The milieu is a marble cake of Mid-east cultures: Judaism messiah, Islam's jihad, Christianity's Bible. But the wild card is the mideval royal families, or &quot;houses&quot; (Pharaoh=&quot;Great House&quot;)that compose the main political force. Then the Spice Guild jockeying for their power. Most authors would stumble and crumble by trying to wangle in such diverse milieus, but Herbert scores yet another touchdown!<br />The protagonist is Paul Atreides, a cross between Luke Skywalker and Ender Wiggam. We are lead along as he grows to understand his destiny as the messiah of Dune. In a sense, we are Paul Atreites as we work out our calling and mission in life.<br />Four final observations:<br />1) This book is a great study for fans of &quot;The Hero With A Thousand Faces.&quot;<br />2) The only draw-back with the book is that it is very serious. There is not a lot of humor, or wise-cracking, even with Gurney, the troubador-soldier. The closest thing to a jock is Duncan Idaho's name. 3) I got thirsty reading this book.<br />4) Don't let the 1984 movie adaptation deter you.

After fifty reviews, not much data can be added, but many conclusions can be reached!<br />Moreover, like the 2000 election or OJ Simpson, most everyone already has an opinion about this book, so this probably won't do much good. But . . .<br />1) Brodie's style is readable, which is more of a criticism of everyone else.  It flows and is quite readable, which is a rare thing.<br />2) The tone of the book is quite unusual.  It is almost a fictional narrative or a speech where the heartstrings are played like a violin.  She builds up suspense (which is not quite scholarly), ask questions that she never answers, and peers into the mind and motives of Joseph Smith.  She, therefore, is getting beyond the manuscripts and primary sources, and becomes a &quot;scholarly outlaw.&quot;  How does she know what Joseph Smith felt and thought unless Joseph Smith tells her?  And if there is no journal entry, where is the data? Ascholarship!<br />3) Many of the conclusions about the book are really conclusions about the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and not about what Ms. Brodie says, inasmuch as people who dislike the Church will agree with her.  This is called &quot;multiplying the mirrors, but not increasing the light.&quot;<br />4) Ms. Brodie asserts a &quot;Hold Me, Thrill Me, Kiss Me, Kill Me&quot; interpretation of Joseph Smith: &quot;You don't know how you got there/You just know you want out/believing in yourself/as much as you doubt.&quot; But confidence is the one thing we see with Joseph Smith.

S. Lewis should get the Medal of Honor and retroactive tax-free citizenship for writing this book.  Yes, it is that powerful!<br />This is the first written and second in the Narnia Chronicals.  It tells the story of Jesus Christ's Atonement through the fable or allegory of Aslan and Edmund.  Edmund, the traitor, sells his sibling over to the White Which, who keeps Narnia under a spell.  A nasty spell where it is always winter, but never Christmas--a child's concept of Hell!<br />Aslan, invoking the &quot;deeper magic&quot; of the Atonement offers himself up as a sacrifice to propitiate the law. Once dead, he rises and frees the Narnians who have been turned to stone.  Peter, the oldest, takes on the Witch, but doesn't attack her, but attacks her wand and then subdues her.<br />The three most brilliant thing about this book are:<br />1) The focus on the Atonement as the central doctrine.<br />2) Recognition of the Atonement as the starting point for the Christian.<br />3) Recognition that life does not end at the Atonement and being born again--there is the rough road of sanctification.

While reading this book, I began to see the elements of the Monomyth in almost every story.  Not only does this enhance my appreciation for the Star Wars Hexalogue, but for other films and books as well.  If you are a fan of &quot;Lord of the Rings,&quot; &quot;Dune,&quot; &quot;The Matrix,&quot; or even &quot;The Smurfs,&quot; you see elements of the Monomyth.<br />Campbell has uncovered something profound in this analysis.  There is a structure to the stories we tell, much like the structure to a Renaissance painting, or even a sonnet or limerick. A formula? No, not if it is done right.  It is only formulaic if it is done poorly, like a bad sonnet.  But the structure enhances poems--think about the last clean limerick you heard.  The meter and structure made that last line all the funnier.  So too with stories that follow the Monomyth pattern. The structure enhances the storytelling.<br />Aspiring writers should memorize and internalize the pattern in this book.  It is the key to unlocking every good book.	2001-08-08

A nice technical book, but does it REALLY suceed?	There are two branches of Latter-day Saint theology: The Technical and the Prophetic.  The Technical theologians focus on man's eternal identity, tend to accept evolution, tend to be politically liberal, and explain the theology in philosophical terms.  The Prophetic  focus on the scriptures, the pedestrian duties of the church, repentance, are politically conservative, and speak with a prophetic, pastoral voice.  Actors  on the one stage are Sterling McMurrin, Orson Pratt, Elder B. H. Roberts, Elder John A. Widtsoe, and Dr. Truman Madsen; on the other stage are Presidents Joseph F. Smith, Joseph Fielding Smith and Ezra Taft Benson, and Elders Boyd K. Packer and Bruce R. McConkie, and the bulk of the 12 million members of the Church.<br />This book follows this general pattern or template of trying to describe the Latter-day Saint theology in terms of philosophy.  Granted, I am glad that someone is trying to make sense of such a complex and texturous religion.  But in describing or explaining the religion in these philosophical terms, he distorts the message.  Frankly, the Church of Jesus Christ possesses a uniqueness that defies any categorization.  It is a pure quiddity!<br />Examples:<br />MIRACLES: &quot;From the perspective of God there are no miracles.&quot; (p. 2).  The Book of Mormon: Another Testament of Jesus Christ (LDS scripture) makes a large point about there being miracles (Moroni 10:24-26), and Elder McConkie, one of the Twelve Apostles, wrote, &quot;In the ultimate sense, all that God does is a miracle.&quot;<br />PELAGIUS:  &quot;Indeed . . . Mormonism is essentially Pelagian in its theology.&quot; (p.82)  I have read every published discourse of Joseph Smith, was born in the covenant, raised an active member, served a mission, and graduated from BYU, and it wasn't until my last semester of college, in an elective class that I heard of Pelagius.  I have never heard any of the current Authorities of the Church use the word &quot;Pelagius.&quot;  I had to explain the word to my brother!  So everyone in the Church is missing the essence?<br />FILTERED PROPHET:  Another mistake, and this is a common one among many people, is that McMurrin is not using Joseph Smith, but Joseph Smith filtered through B. H. Roberts.  In his discussion of &quot;Intelligences&quot; on page 108, he alludes to Joseph Smith, but the text he quotes is Robert's text.  Several leaders, such a Joseph Fielding Smith and Bruce R. McConkie have understood Joseph Smith's ideas differently, but McMurrin does not acknowledge that.<br />I appreciate the endeavor, but in using &quot;traditional philosophical terminology,&quot; such as the platonic &quot;being and becoming&quot; (p. 11-13), he assumes that Joseph Smith's ideas would fit into Platonic assumptions.  If the piece won't fit into the puzzle, reshape it.  Then it is no longer the same piece.  That is the hazard of trying to &quot;translate&quot; or &quot;transpose&quot; the theology into educraticeese, the message is garbled, and ultimately betrayed.ad to explain the word to my brother!

US	50147915	RZC5CGHEEYBGN	0802808689	694218053	God in the Dock: Essays on Theology and Ethics	Books	5	17	18	N	N	Theological tour de force!	If Indiana Jones was a theologian, this would be the type of book he would write.  This book is a collection of essays and speeches on various topics, such as evolution, miracles, absolute values, et cetera!  It provides a good introduction to Clivian thought.<br />Despite having died in 1963, Lewis still remains relevant.  He has that wonderful blend of velvet and steel, of logic and humor, that keeps us interested.  Even if you are not Anglican, as I am, you still appreciate his logic, arguments, and reasoning.<br />Lewis never takes &quot;the ostrich approach&quot; to difficult questions like so man Christians.  he doesn't use his faith as a security blanket, or a doge, or a trump card.  And He has NEVER checked his brain in at the door!  I really believe that many Christians use the &quot;Ostrich Technique&quot; as a cover for laziness.  they prefer Sports Center, or shopping to the knuckle-work of actually understanding what we believe, and where we are going.<br />Lewis does none of this.  He takes the questions head-on and provides a reason for belive.  Remember, religion is not just an affair of the heart, but also of the mind.  Remember, God invented brains.  God invented logic!	2001-05-15

Lewis says more with one letter than some people say their entire lives!<br />This book requires two pre-requisites: &quot;Pilgrims Progress&quot; by Bunyan, and &quot;Surprised by Joy,&quot; by Lewis.  You will be lost with out this background.  It also helps to be a genius, but I don't believe I can be of much help in that area.<br />This is an allegory of Lewis eventual conversion to Anglican Christianity.  It presents Lewis's own story in the story of a young boy John and his struggles with religion, and how he wanders here and there trying to find God and what He is about.<br />The chapters are usually short, but in typical Lewis fashion, he packs a lot of thought in a small sentence.  And the surprising thing is that he is so readable.  There is no academic or philosophical mumbo-jumbo. It is all to rare straight talk!<br />This book is not just a journey to Christianity and to Christ, but also a vary biting commentary on the worldly and secular philosophies current in the world.  Pay close attention, and see how many of the pundants and professors you see pasted in the story!<br />This is Lewis's first book, and it his his &quot;Q&quot; document--the source for much of his corpulent corpus of writing.  It is is a good overview to Clivian thought!	2001-05-10

When Doyle was attending medical school, one of his professors, Dr. Joseph Bell, could deduce the life of his patients by simple observation.  This seed eventually blossomed into Sherlock Holmes.<br />To begin with, we all know who he is and what he is about, but we can take the next step and actually read the stories behind the icon.  Most Sherlockians agree that it is best not to start with &quot;A study in Scarlet.&quot;  I think it is best to start with the collection &quot;Adventures of Sherlock Holmes,&quot; with the story &quot;A scandal in Bohemia&quot; then rad your way through several of the collations.  then you can go back and read &quot;A Study in Scarlet,&quot; and &quot;The Sign of Four.&quot;  Doyle's writing gets better as the stories progress, until you hit &quot;The Hound of the Baskervilles.&quot;<br />AS been noted, Holmes becomes a bit of an addiction.  Doyle is that good of a writer.  As I said, everyone knows who he is, like  Tarzan, Elvis, or Madonna.<br />The only drawback is that some of Doyle's earlier stories can get a bit tedious and somewhat formulaic at times.  But the attraction is still there!<br />Yes, it is worth the money to buy the complete Sherlock &quot;cannon!&quot;	2001-05-10

This book is essential for anyone curious about the life of Lewis.  Or anyone who his a fan of his thought.<br />This book is a bout the life and conversion of Lewis, told as an autobiography, as opposed to an allegory as in &quot;Pilgrim's Regress.&quot;  It culminates with Lewis's conversion to Anglican Christianity:<br />&quot;You must picture me alone in that room in Magdalen, night after night, feeling . . . the steady, unrelenting approach of Him who I so earnestly desired not to meet. . . I [finally] gave in and admitted that God was God, and I knelt a prayed: perhaps, that night, the most dejected and reluctant convert in all England. I did not see then what is now the most shining and obvious thing: the Divine humility will accept a convert even on such terms. The Prodigal Son at least walked on his own feet. But who can duly adore that Love which will open the high gates to a prodigal who is brought in kicking, struggling, resentful, and darting his eyes in every direction for a chance of escape?&quot;<br />This book, however is not religious mumbo-jumbo, and is not just strictly a religious text, but it encompasses other aspects of Lewis's life: his experience as a son, a brother, a student, an intellectual freebooter, etc.<br />On a human level, this book has touched and resonated with me more than any other book I have read, outside of Scripture.  I have experienced many of the same things Lewis had experienced.  In a slightly different way, and in a different order, but there was enough of the essence of the events to harmonize with me.  I almost felt that I was Lewis in a way.<br />Even if you are a non-Christian, non-believer, or a non-interested person, I recommend this book as part of one humans experience in life, as one slice of humanity!	2001-05-10

Just read the preface to the book and you'll be hooked!<br />Kreeft does a wonderful job of elaboration upon Lewis' ideas of the process of &quot;abolishing&quot; humanity.  The central question to Lewis's book is: can we cease to be human by loosing our moral sense?  Kreeft's central question is:  how does Lewis's writings and thought apply to us in the Third Millenium?<br />His most haunting chapter is Chapter Four: &quot;Can Natural Law ever be Abolished from the Heart of Man?&quot;  He discusses weather or not we can ever lose our moral sense, our conscience.  This is an urgent dicussion, when you look at the souless children killing children in the school shootings.  We seem to be raising up a generation of moral zombies who are acting like Hannibal Lecter eating each other up.<br />The Founding Fathers well recognized the necessity of moral law, and that structure in government can only go so far (see Federalist Papers 10 and 51).  there needs to be an undergirding morality upon which our government, and every government rests.  If not, somthing worse than the dark ages will occur.<br />(Question:  What is the difference between someone without a moral sense, and someone who ignores it?  I can't see any difference.)<br />Kreeft's voice is a voice of warning.  But will we listen?  And will we care?	2001-03-30

McConkie's largest discourses.  &quot;The Purifying Power of Gethsemane&quot; is Elder McConkie's last General Conference talk, and includes his powerful and sure testimony and  witness to the life of Jesus Christ.  This talk is as good as anything in  the Standard Works.<br />The second talk, &quot;The Seven Deadly  Heresies,&quot; is a discourse Elder McConkie gave at BYU that names and  refutes seven of the prominant heresies, or theological errors, prominent  among members of the church.  These inclue evolution, second-chance theory,  God's omniscience and omnipotence, an elaboration of eternal progession,  and so forth.<br />The only criticism I would have of this book is that it  left out Elder McConkie's third best talk, &quot;The Lord God of Joseph  Smith,&quot; which can be found in &quot;Sermons and Writings of Bruce R.  McConkie.&quot;<br />Thisd inexpensive book is well worth the price, and the  talks should be memorized!	2000-04-15

Packer has given over the years as a General Authority and an Apostle.  It is a wonderful selection that leaves you wanting  more.<br />The strength of this book is that it is not &quot;A-Bomb,&quot;  hard-line theology.  This book shows how God works through normal  situations and through normal people.  Practical theology at its  best.<br />President Packer is an accomplished amature artist, and many of his  works illustrate this book and give it a homey, warm feeling.	2000-04-15

It makes the NT a pleasure to read, and it is a nice resource for understanding the New Testament. The flow of the translation is smooth, and  the footnotes are minimal.  The sometime awkward and archaic King Jame's  language does not get in the way of the message of the NT.<br />Mr. Phillips  workde with C. S. Lewis on the translation, which is why it is such a  pleasure to read.<br />The main drawback of this edition of the NT is that  there is no versification (as was had in previous editions), which make  comparison a bit more difficult.  Futhermore, it is a paraphrase edition,  and, at times, is loose with the translation of the text.<br />I would like to  see a CD-ROM edition of this paraphrase translation!	2000-03-31
