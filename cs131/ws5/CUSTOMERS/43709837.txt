The author introduces the foundation to the necessary basics to train and compete, if desired. Yet, boxing is a hands on sport that must be physically executed to truly learn. A book can serve as a guide or to attempt to enlighten one to the basics, but without a coach or sparring partner it can never be understood.<br /><br />The recent trend to train in the exercises of a boxer has gained popularity because it is one of the toughest sports, if not the toughest, to obtain to appropriate amount of fitness in order to safely compete.	2005-09-27

Buchanan supports his thesis with a comparison of world history. He seems to want to mix church & state. Writes that less government is better and supports the 10th amendament (states rights). Supports our (Americans) inability to defeat a faith based enemy (terrorist) without a faith based force of our own.<br /><br />This book is worth a critical read, Buchanan makes some valid points. Yet, he seems unable to seperate his religous faith from his political beliefs. There seems to be a close relation to the U.S. involvement in Iraq and  Bush; similiar to Viet Nam and President LBJ.<br /><br />The reader needs to make their own critical analysis. I am neither a liberal or a conservative and attempt to make a fair analysis, unlike most of the posted reviews so far. The book is worth an evening or two of your time versus watching TV and the idiotic \\"Reality Shows\\".	2004-09-22

Threat Profiling is used by every other counrty in the world, yet Americans think it is something immoral. Immorality is the governments failure to exercise all due caution in the protection of its citizens. Threat Profiling is based on a formula of several factors, when those factors are present a reasonable suspicion should be present and additional investigation is necessary.

There are no rules of war when engaged with an enemy.

As for her skill as a soldier/warrior I think she is lacking in that position.<br />This story brings to point the following questions:<br />1.women in the combat services and the skill or ability to perform said task.<br />2.The publication and dissemination of misinformation by the U.S. goverment.<br />3.The justification for the invasion into Iraq.<br />All of these questions remain unanswered.

And, I wish such a book was in print in the 1970's when I began my search for realistic self-defense training.<br />The author's philosophy of training for real life encounters is extremely accurate. Although, it is not supported by scientific research, such as the book by Bruce Siddle \\"Sharpening the Warriors Edge\\" a book designed for police training in lethal encounters. Yet, Quinn basis this concept on practical experience and a realistic understanding of what truly takes place during a fight. Which is very refreshing in todays world of unrealistic mythical martial arts that make fictitious claims about there style of self-defense abilty.<br />The concept is simple, inoculate the mind and body to the effects of stress (FEAR) created adrenaline; to overcome the effects so as to prevail in any given self-defense situation. To create this level of skill one must train under circumstances as close to realistic as possible. This means actual hand to hand combat at close to full force and power as one can safely accomplish.<br />As the author states, and I agree 100%, boxing is as close and as realistic of a form of training for this process of inoculation yet, most people do not have the time or the desire to submitt to the practice necessary to achieve the goal. So, Quinn has designed a system of training that achieves a level of competence that is sufficient to meet the desired goal.<br />The Law Enforcement community formally realized this about 15 years ago with the dynamic scenario (RED MAN) training. Although, police academies for years prior had required cadets to box or wrestle full contact. That is before the politically correct individuals got involved and said that women officers should not have to fight the men officers, and that this is a kinder gentler society. So, no one in police academies have boxed or trained at full contact now for over 20 years. No wonder, there are so many lawsuits filed against police agencies for excessive and unlawful use of force! The officers were not given the proper training and inoculation to this adrenaline stress so, they over react. I digress only to make a point of fact in reference to this concept of training.<br />The book maintains a practical view of self-defense. That is, situational awareness and perception of a threat and then avoidance of said threat is the best technique. Avoidance and preemption is always the best strategy.<br />One must achieve the proper mindset and mental preparation before any technique can be effective. The individual must be conditioned to control and channel the effects of fear and the adrenaline stress that follows it. Once this is accomplished the individual can now concern himself with the physical skills and techniques of hand to hand combat. Without this conditioned response to the adrenaline stress, all else is useless.<br />Buy the book and include this type of training into your self-defense program. This book is for all people interested in self-defense programs that need to be effective, including police and military, martial art instructors, firearms instructors, and the citizen who accepts responsibilty for their own safety and security.suits filed against police agencies for excessive and unlawful use of force!

The stories in and of themself are enjoyable and somewhat enlightening, especially into the background and persona of Christensen.<br />This was an enjoyable book, yet my personal quest was better met by reading the book \\"Living the Martial Way\\" by Forrest Morgan. Although, I truly did enjoy reading \\"Crouching Tiger\\" my goal was better served by the purchase of Morgan's book.<br />I would recommend this book to all begining martial art students in an attempt to help them along their path. It would also be beneficial to the intermediate level as well as the black belt student who has yet, been able to discover their own \\"Warrior Spirit\\".

This book is about Canada's immigration problems, which in turn creates a problem for America. Since it is exteremly easy to gain  illegal entry into the U.S.A. all along our northern border, once legal entry into Canada is obtained. Just as the terrorist of the 9-11 attack on the WTC did. And legal entry into Canada has historically been easier than into the U.S.A.<br />The author Mike Taylor brings out several important facts about immigration to both Canada and America. Immigration of the past 50 years is all about economic gains for the national and international corporations and not for the benefit of the immigrants themselves. The attempted globalization of the economy  by the United Nations and the greed driven corporations has created the current immigration problems from the 3rd world countries into both Canada and the U.S. It is all about money for the elite class of people who control the government and industry.<br />There is no need for these immigrants to assimilate and become like other citizens. Not in a country which enables them to stay segregated from the culture, via welfare and other socialist programs that allow these individuals to survive in what was once a foreign country to them.<br />...<br />Taylor's book presents a logical and well founded critique of the problem and outlines the concerns of the current culture; although a bit redundant at times. His last line in the book may be the most significant. (Buy the book and read the last line yourself)<br />Good Luck! I think it is too late to correct and change our destiny as to what was once a great country. I tell my children that the U.S.A. as we have known it since 1776 will not be in existence in 100 years, I am sorry to say.

It is a book with great submission holds. But, before one can attempt to apply these submission holds they must be capable of fighting hand to hand and then successfully and safely be able to place their attacker into one of these holds; not likely without alot of previous experience and training. Pass on this book unless you are an experienced fighter looking for some good finishing holds; but realize for everyone of these holds there is at least one counter or escape move, so learn those also.

This book should be read by all police officers and possibly by all recruits in the academy. It should be a mandatory text to be studied by all police use of force instructors, this includes firearm instructors. Any instructor who is serious about teaching their students effective techniques of survival need themselves to understand the psycological process of a lethal threat encounter and be capable of imparting said knowledge to their students.

This book starts out with a great concept and begins to cover the topic in detail and with logical reasoning(first 2 chapters). Then it turns into a basic how to fight book with simple techniques dispalyed in simple photos. The topic is a relevant one for realistic self-defense and hand to hand combat. The author writes with some apparent authority on the subject matter, yet the book fails to live up to the concept. This book is acceptable for the novice to intermediate student of realistic hand to hand combat. It is by no means acceptable to those of us with the expertise the author claims to have and may possess; yet the book failed to meet the expectations it leads one to believe. The topic could have and should have been covered in greater detail, such as in Dave Grossmans book \\"On Killing\\" or other such books dealing with the psychological mindset of a warrior. ... see my \\"Listmania\\" suggestions.	2001-09-05

The author has done an exceptional amount of research and training, some of which is presented in this book. This subject of pressure point fighting is exteremly difficult to learn without the guidance of a competent instructor or training partner. The book serves as a guide to those already studying the martial arts; it is not for the novice or the self taught individual. That said, pressure point fighting as it is called is not the end all for self defense tactics. Pressure point techniques do serve a good purpose in ones arsenal of self defense tactics, but they are designed to supplement ones total fighting system. And as it has been said before, it is difficult to strike an exact pressure point during active hand to hand combat. Pressure point control holds and escape techniques play a more active role in ones self defense arsenal. So if you have experience in the martial arts or CQB this book will serve to support some of your training, with the use of a competent partner or instructor. Novices or individuals looking for the quick fix (which there are none) try another book.	2001-08-28

I found my pressure point strikes and control holds to be my weakest knowledge base, so I purchased this encyclopedia and that is exactly what this book is, an exteremely informative encyclopedia. It is full of pressure point meridians and applications of such. But, it is like studying a text book from medical school. I am a working cop &amp; a part time graduate student working toward a doctoral degree in adult education and this book has more knowledge listed than most of the $100.00 text books I must purchase for school. I have yet to complete the entire text, and wonder if I will ever get around to it. So, the book is worth every penny to those individuals willing to read and re-read the material and willing to committ to memory all of the meridians and application of said. The author has done an excellent job of compiling data and presenting detailed photos and illustrations, along with the appropriate text. This book is not for the novice or the quick fix type person, it will require alot of study and practice with an enlightened instructor. Buy the book.	2001-08-28

Marginal Book	No book could ever hope to be capable enough to deliver the knowledge and expertise that Professor Wally Jay holds. This book is marginal at best at attempting to impart the knowledge of such an expert as Wally Jay. The book is published in a style popular in the 1970's by karate publications, in that it is presented via numerous black &amp; white photos demonstrating techniques. The book is an acceptable text to those individuals who are already acquainted with Jujitsu and its concepts, for the novice it is somewhat more difficult to comprehend the techniques. I have attended seminars presented by Prof. Jay and know him to be one of the best martial artist living today and a great instructor with a hell of a personality. Maybe, thats why I am some what disappointed with the quality of the book, there are much better books available to those interested in martial arts, jujitsu, or self defense than this one. If you are a student of small circle jujitsu then you should own this book. I hope someday soon another more informative book is published by this truely talented and gifted instructor	2001-08-27

The author who did the fight scenes for the movie &quot;Billy Jack&quot; (1972 ?) was my introduction to the art of Hapkido. It was one of the reasons I began to study the arts. But, this book is done in such a simple style with very basic techniques and concepts it does not contain the elements of hapkido, but as one reviewer wrote it is more like basic Taekwondo, I agree. My 11 year old son can write more about Hapkido than this book presents. Granted this is a publication from 1974. Yet, Master Han possessed the knowledge and expertise back then. I would like to see this author produce a new book or update this book and include the concepts and principles of Hapkido with its techniques of joint locks, pressure point strikes, submission &amp; control holds, and self defense techniques. The strikes which this text demonstrate are not even black belt level for taekwondo students. I think this book was thrown together hastily and does an injustice to Hapkido and Grandmaster Han. ....	2001-08-27

Applegate (taught in 1943), Fairbairn, Sykes. This system is nothing more than an eclectic blend of martial arts with a Israeli label. This is not to say that some of the techniques are without merit. These techniques are designed to face an armed adversary, which in the middle east it is a high probability, not in the U.S.A. at least not yet. If you feel the odds are against you for facing an armed attacker, then carry a gun and learn some unarmed self defense techniques. Again, this book has some merits for soldiers and anti-terrorist troops. For the civilian interested in self-defense there are many more books published which have more to offer the reader.

The book is full of firearm skills to practice and relevant tatcics for self defense use with a handgun. Mr. Taylor writes with authority regarding the technical operation and discharge of a handgun. There are good training tips and advice given to the novice as well as the advanced handgunner. I did find too much emphasis placed on the Weaver Stance. Taylor neglects to discuss \\"point shooting\\" techniques for that spontaneous lethal threat encounter, which is most likely to attack a armed individual. Granted if one knew of an impending lethal threat they would have their handgun drawn and held in a perfect two hand grip with a balanced stance facing the oncoming attack ready to fire. But, in the real world of predators who attack by surpise and without notice one must be able to respond immediately without hesitancy and discharge their weapon while attempting to evade the oncoming attack. This leaves no time for the optimum stance or grip on the handgun. Point shooting is the scientifically proven response to the spontaneous threat. Under the extreme stress of a spontaneous life threatening encounter the body reacts in a manner that is not suitable for responding in the two hand grip weaver stance. Individuals who carry a handgun for protection need to read and train in the technique of point shooting, along with the techniques Taylor write about.	2001-08-24

This book outlines the forefathers of close quarter combat with knives and writes about their contributions to this warrior art. The book gives an above average curriculum for training with knives for defense as well as offense. It will serve well as a primer on the topic.

As a martial artist, a police officer and a defensive tacics instructor, I felt an instant bond with the writings of Christensen. For, I too have been through most of what he writes about and agree with about 95% of his writings.<br />The book is an excellent blend of martial arts and police defensive tactics with a realistic view of what is practical and what is BS. Too many police DT instructors lack a martial arts background and refuse to acknowledge that the vast majority of techniques originated in the asian martial arts systems.<br />The book is an excellent reference for both the rookie officer and the veteran officer alike. It is also a good refernce for the new DT instructor or one who lacks a martial artist background. I found nothing new or exciting contained in the text, of course, I rarely do in most of the books published today. After 26 years as a martial artist and 19 years as a DT instructor one discovers there are no new tricks, just good ole fashioned basic techniques and concepts practiced at a higher level of effectiveness.<br />I did enjoy the author's stories and his sense of humor. All of Christensen's books are worth reading. It is an enjoyable and easy book to read, I recommended it to all serious students of self-defense and police officers looking to maintain a tactical edge.	2001-08-23

In war time or in a true life or death self-defense situation that is the only option; kill or get killed. All parties interested in realistic self-defense must accept this concept and act appropriately . This book is not for those &quot;Paper Tiger&quot; black belts or sudo warriors. The princples and concepts are as relevant today as they were 58 years ago, when the data for this book was compiled. Some of the weapons and technical data is outdated, yet the goal is the same; survival... The point shooting techniques are practical and realistic and have proven to be reproducible under the stress of a lethal encounter; unlike those target shooting techniques of the weaver stance. The tactcis and techniques that Col. Applegate learned from Fairbairn and Sykes is one of the most effective and practical systems of training for survival during close quarter combat situations, especially given the time limits to train recruits. Granted if more time were allowed for training (every trainer desires more time to teach recruits) other techniques would be added and more practice could be conducted. Some of the hand to hand techniques are questionable, i.e. knife hand chops, but for the most part a very capable curriculum for training soldiers, police officers and citizens in the survival concepts and tactics. If one is not prepared to take the life of another in a true life or death encounter, than that individual should not even attempt to consider themselves capable of self-defense; especially soldiers.	2001-08-21
