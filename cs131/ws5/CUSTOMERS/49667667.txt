While I agree with the others, Howell's story is better than Sands, they are still TWO OUTSTANDING stories. It is kind of like saying chocolate is better than caramel. Come on, they are both yummy! And so are these two stories. The highlanders Cathal and Connall are strong compassionate men who must face a difficult decision. I will not ruin the book - and I hate when reviews do that. A review should encourage you to either read the book or skip it - I highly encourage you to read it. This is an eternal keeper!	2005-09-28

This was undoubtedly one of most beautiful love stories I have EVER read and I read A LOT! I won't ruin anything for you but if you enjoy time travel love stories, stories about cowboys, or anything to do with true passionate soul mates READ THIS BOOK NOW! I have never read anything by Miller before but I think I have found a new favorite author!	2005-08-24

I really cannot say enough about it. I cannot wait for Flesh and Stone next April (what an awfully long year)! I do not want to ruin anything so all I will say is READ it and ENJOY! Nathan and Rachel absolutely sizzle and it is great fun to watch them fight the attraction and lose :)  This on is a real winner!	2005-07-24

She is a genious when it comes to providing intrigue and mystery without making you crazy waiting for the point.  She gives just enough to keep you interested without making you anxious. Jamie and Alec are perfect! Do yourself a favor and READ THIS BOOK	2005-02-14

I put off reading it because I did not think I would enjoy the whole vampire thing. I was wrong - the story is about MUCH more than that, and I absolutely LOVED it. Feehan is an excellent author, pulling you into a story so much that you feel like you are living it. I cannot say enough about her or this book. I just ordered the rest of the series, and I cannot wait to &quot;devour&quot; it!	2004-07-20

It is not one of Jude's best, but it is an early book.  She definitely improves as an author!  <br />I am almost done with this book (I put it away and started another but had to go back).  I think that says it all.  It is a book you cannot walk away from without finishing - In spite of the fact that you want to SCREAM through-out the story!  Seth is an IDIOT and I must say Morgan is too. One thing about this story that is unbelievable is that Seth could love Morgan as much as he says he does and then completely disbelieve her just because a man HE HATES claims she cheated. And then everything Morgan is subjected to because Seth does not believe her and she still takes him back. I am assuming she will, they always do. Even though it seems unbelievable, the characters seem real (not their actions maybe).  They are well written in that you feel their anger, happiness, etc. It is kind of like a movie with a bad script but your favorite actors are in it and you want to watch them. I must go and finish this because I can't seem to walk away!	2004-07-12

It has been a few months since I read this book, but I remember enjoying it.  I remember laughing a lot at some of the antics the women played to manipulate their husbands and leader into doing what they wanted. Sometimes I was frustrated by the unfair treatment of the women, especially Mirana, but lets face it - that is how men treated women then.  I think coulter offers just enough of those situations to keep it believable. She also adds enough funny situations to keep the focus off of the mistreatment. There are some very interesting plot twists too. I think it is an enjoyable read.  Some people try to think too much instead of just &quot;listening&quot; to the story.	2004-06-30

This was outstanding, just like everything else she has written, and I've read EVERYTHING, at least what she's written as Kinley.  Her characters always have great depth and become so real, I feel like they are friends of mine by the end of the book. I felt all of Rowena' frustration, Styder's pain and enjoyed their intimate moments too!! It is like being right there in the room with them. I cannot wait until the next brotherhood story, and I hope she writes about each one.  Each time I read one I swear the hero is the man of all men and then she give us another... Phew I can't wait to see what happens with Christian.	2004-06-23

I agree that I enjoy it more when love is reciprocated sooner.  Even if he is not willing to admit it to her yet, I at least want him to admit it to himself!  I hated seeing Evelyn selling herself short.  EVEN SO, I did enjoy the book.  It was the first Waddel book I have read and I look forward to &quot;He Said No&quot;.  I would recommend this book!	2004-06-10

Deveraux kept me curious - I had to find out when and how Alex's secret would be discovered.  I must say that at times I was annoyed like &quot;enough already, tell Jess the truth.&quot; As well as could she be that dense to not figure it out on her own? Even though I felt it dragged the anticipation a bit thin, I am glad I finished it - I did enjoy it.  Give it a chance and I hope you will too!	2004-06-06

It taught him about the civil war AND the plight of the Irish immigrant.  He identified with Charlie.  It was great fun watching charlie handle each new experience/adventure.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS BOOK FOR CHILDREN LEARNING ABOUT THE CIVIL WAR!!	2004-03-30

Gawain is a true hero, a genuinely great guy.  He isn't overly macho like most leading men, he is caring, loving, and damned sexy without being a brute.  Juliana is a terrific mate for him, the true swan maiden.  I must agree with another reviewer, reading Laird of the Wind would help with the hero's background but you will still understand the story, i read it afterward and didn't enjoy Swan Maiden any less.  I also LOVED the Sword Maiden and I am now reading the Stone Maiden.  What will i do when this book is finished... find another Susan King book!	2003-11-18

If you never read a series, read this one, AND READ IT IN ORDER!! Kinley is sensational and truly the best author ever.

I will try another Lynn Bailey book to make sure this just wasn't a fluke.  Don't misunderstand, if you don't have anything else, read it.  it is just too predictable without any extras to make it worthwhile.  I thought Nicholas and Rietta deserved a better story or at least a more adventerous one.	2003-05-19

Ms. Jeffries has outdone herself with this one.  Gideon is the man by whom all others should be measured.  He is incredible in EVERY way. How anyone could rate this book poorly I don't understand.  The chemistry between Gideon and Sara is unstoppable.  Sarah does have a tendancy to get a little too prudish and repeats herself, but Gideon more than makes up for it, especially once he learns how to stop her ranting.  If he was mine I would rant just to have him stop me!!!	2003-05-19
