Green duly traces Alexander's career on its insane march forward with scholarly aplomb, extensive footnoting, and common sense. He has given  us the facts stripped of the myth as best they can be reconsructed. I might  prefer a few more detailed anecdotes for entertainment value, even  ridiculous stories to be dismissed, as well as a bit more description of  the countries and cultures through which the army proceeds. But why  quibble, this is good stuff.	1999-09-27

Deftly  handled (I see so more the older I get) are the quite strength of  Moominmamma, the frustrated ambitions of Moominpappa, the wistful  sensitivity of Moomintroll, and the enviable independence of Little My. The  early autumn atmosphere of deep pools, hidden thickets, lighthouse and  storm are magical. First rate stuff.	1999-08-25

The previous reviewer doesn't seem to realize that this is indeed a complete traditional version of this story, with the orchard and  butterchurn material that has been deleted from many modern retellings.  Galdone tells it straight, without much revising, which is increasingly  rare; modern authors and illustrators seem to think these stories have been  done to death and instead choose to parody them, perhaps not realizing that  everything is new to a young child, and kids won't realize what is being  parodied until they know the original.

The last of this fine series is a sweeping effort to bring all the characters from previous books together. Cooper writes well enough, and this is all based on an extremely complicated set of Arthurian mythologies.  But by now we are rather tired of these vague metaphysical risings of  power, which seem less chilling the more they happen. This novel flies all  over the place in space and time, more like a series of adventures than a  cohesive whole. It tends to seem a bit long and arbitrary (as when Blowden  Rowlands is suddenly unmasked.) In short, this book gets lost in itself.  Fantasy mongers may like it more than I did.	1999-07-09

Especially good were the ones by Edward Packard. His colleague R.A. Montgomery wrote less  successful efforts. This one displays his fondness for negative and often  arbitrary endings, as well as for a sort of new agey bizarreness.

At his best he was sublime (&quot;Young Goodman Brown&quot;), and at his worst he was ridiculous (&quot;The Bosom Serpent&quot;). This books lies somewhere in between. It  is based on an interesting premise, the handing down of a sin through  generations, and the dark shadow of Puritanism.

And she wonders why she gets used! I wonder what's become of  her since. So, for the most part these are the curt ramblings of a would-be  hipster journalist, without much detail or interest. But then, hardcore  Beatle fans will definitely want to check it out for the famous chapter on  Paul McCartney - indeed, this chapter does offer fascinating insight into a  side of McCartney seen nowhere else in print, perhaps even moreso than  Carol Bedford's &quot;Waiting for the Beatles&quot; shed light on George  Harrison. Yes, Paul in the summer of '68 was a tormented, unhappy man, Jane  Asher having failed to give him the kind of security he so desperately  craved, while John's new infatuation with Yoko (both of whom Schwartz views  as benevolent friends to Paul and to herself) accidentally aggravated  Paul's hidden yearnings. Seen in this light, Linda McCartney becomes both  and inevitable part of the story, and even a savior of sorts, which  Schwartz inherently recognizes she herself cannot be. (One wonders how Paul  is bearing up now that Linda is gone.) The grand result of all these  important and previously shadowy moods was &quot;Hey Jude&quot;; yes, it is  more about Paul than about Julian. In just one chapter of an otherwise  tedious book, Schwartz manages to make all of this abundantly clear,  despite generally vague writing style. She is a valuable primary source for  Beatle scholars, to be compared and included with other sources.	1999-04-21

There is an air  of thrilling secrecy about the practice of great artistry in this plot that  is compelling.	1999-04-14

For those  who nitpick about typos or small factual errors, just be glad you can spot  them and hope they will be corrected in subsequent editions. Overall this  is an enormously important document for Beatles historians, for here we get  Paul's take on everything for the record. As with any such document, we  must question the accuracy and slant of Mccartney's memories, just as we  should do with Lennon's Rolling Stone and Playboy interviews. But by  comparing this important primary source with so many others, the real truth  of this incredible story can emerge. The study of such things is greatly  enriched by this perspective.	1999-04-09

Plus, how the heck did Larry King's voice get on that tape? And why does  the teacher just sort of ride off into the sunset at the end? However, the  anger management theme is a good one, and this reads rather well.	1999-04-01

It has its own unique artistic feel, rather different from the the film, though the text is basically the same.

I  actually preferred &quot;Over Sea, Under Stone,&quot; which in many ways is  a more subtle book. Here, as I suppose magic warrants, the descriptions of  what is actually happening get a bit vague. Sometimes it even leaves me  frustrated that I haven't spent years studying the original Arthurian  myths, but this is a measure of the book's intelligence.	1999-03-31

It is of course his last and unfinished novel, though as the introduction  and notes of the excellent Penguin edition make clear, there is little  doubt about how it might have proceeded, and it's not so much a  &quot;mystery&quot; novel as we have come to understand the term. For  heaven's sake, don't get some edition that has been &quot;finished&quot; by  someone else. What we have here is the dark work of a mature stylist, who  still has the gifts of comedy and character. The obsessive nature of  Jasper's love mirrors the character of Bradley Headstone in &quot;Our  Mutual Friend.&quot;	1999-03-23

However, in later years he got a bit daffy, and failed to rise above the mere rout of disgusting characters.

Herrigel, a German, and his wife lived in Japan for five years and learned Zen through the practices of Archery and  Flower Arranging, respectively. This fascinating account of Zen teaching at  work (with a difficult learner) illumines the depths of the matter as well  as any printed words can; plus, it's an entertaining true story. I  especially like the part where the Master determines to try to see the  westerner's point of view in order to help his pupil learn, so he gets a  book of German philosophers, but gives up in disgust, noting that it's no  wonder the man who concerns himself with such things can't shoot an arrow  straight!	1999-03-08

I must say it seems ponderous and slow-moving in the beginning, and it never really does explain why Elvis had to go into  the army in the first place. For someone like myself who wasn't around then  it's puzzling - were people usually drafted during peacetime in the  fifties? Certainly they didn't send him to Germany for an Asian war?

In short, it is the last great novel. There hasn't been a truly great one since in my humble opinion. Too often nowadays writers  write with an eye towards turning the thing into a movie. And while a great  film was made of this, the novel stands squarely on its own as an important  American masterpiece. I like the fact that Harper Lee only wrote one novel.  What else could she do after this?	1999-03-01

Select chapters involving  the Veneerings and high society are pure comic delight. The moody and  obsessive rivalry of Bradley Headstone and Eugene Wrayburn is fascinating.

It simply doesn't hold together, as the author changes his mind about the book's direction a few times during its serial publication; changes the  nature of certain characters along the way; and reveals the narrator's  identity at the end (always a mistake) when in fact it is most unlikely  that this particular character could have known half of what went on in the  book. Modern readers will find it quite sentimental, but then it made  Dickens hugely popular in his day, and is not without memorable characters  as always, among them the quasi-demonic Daniel Quilp. Quilp seems to do  evil for no particular reason other than that he himself is evil, therefore  the book offers little pointed social critique. Dickens is nothing if not  entertaining, however, and he is always worth a look.	1999-01-06

Coleman tells the Lennon story from his perspective as a British journalist and former acquaintance of John Lennon.  As such he is in touch with many valuable sources, and not with others.  Perhaps this books should be read in tandem with Albert Goldman's  negatively sensational but well-researched biography.

Books	4	9	9	N	N	Loving blather	In a series of reviews and annoyingly rambling interviews, Paul Williams sets out to excuse just about everything Brian Wilson ever did. Still, one can't help but be drawn in by the man's enthusiasm, and his reviews of the  recent &quot;Good Vibrations&quot; box set and the &quot;I Just Wasn't Made  For These Times&quot; CD are perceptive.	1999-01-06

It was much praised by critics for focusing on the music, but really most of what is said is descriptive - you can find out this stuff for yourself by simply  listening to the albums, which I recommend doing rather than reading about  it -or perhaps with  the books &quot;A Hard Day's Write&quot; by Steve  Turner and &quot;The Beatles Recording Sessions&quot; by Mark Lewisohn on  hand, if one really wants to shed light on the music.	1999-01-06

At the time it was simply a pop bio by a competent writer, but it depicts the Beatles at a fascinating juncture in their career. It is particularly notable for its  accounts of songwriting and recording sessions, for a glimpse of their home  lives, and for their opinions about life in general at the time. Since this  is an authorized biography, critics may complain that it is whitewashed -  but one can read between the lines and gather the full meaning of  everything pretty well. All in all, it is remarkably honest. This updated  edition features a sterling introduction by the author about the writing of  the book and offers further insight into the personalities of the Beatles.	1999-01-06

However, despite its poignancy, I do not feel that it is a great novel, and I can't really think  of the words to say why, as is sometimes the case when trying to explain  the difference between good and great.

The non-hero locks himself away in his bizarre home, and spends every other chapter commenting on his tastes in literature, music, art, cologne, food, etc, while  experimenting with his effete senses and trying to make life bearable  amidst his world-weary wealth and need for sublime excitement. (Many a  modern disaffected suburban youth may be able to identify with this.) In so  doing he simply becomes more withdrawn and ill, demonstrating the  impossibility of living apart from real life. I especially like the part  where he makes up his mind to go to London, but finds all the Englishness  he needs by simply sitting the train station, and retires home again. One  other critic said of the author and critic Huysmans that he would either  commit suicide or retreat into the arms of the church. Indeed, he did the  latter, having found that renouncing everything left him with nothing. This  is a novel for those with sophisticated taste, and a keen sense of the  absurd.	1999-01-05

(Dickens perhaps prefigures Orwell with his Coketown of  horror.) While some of the business about labor unions is unsuccessful, the  love/despair story of Louisa Gradgrind is superbly rendered.

The title refers to a poem by John Donne, in which the poet seems to suggest that the tribulations of any humans are the business of others as well. Hemingway  has applied this notion to the Spanish Civil War, of which he was a  first-hand witness. The plight of the Spaniards here should be the concern  of all of us. The problem is, his point is clearly made by the title, and  the rest of the book does nothing to improve upon it. This long tome about  rebels trying to blow up a bridge ends poorly; the characters don't arouse  too much sympathy, and the whole thing goes nowhere, except where the fine  title has already taken it.	1998-12-30

Here the problem is not only that he focuses almost exclusively on unpleasantness, (though there are very occasional good  passages about the music), but also that he keeps taking time out to  introduce every two-bit friend or advisor in great detail, while giving  little personality to any of the Beach Boys themselves. He then delves  numbingly into complicated business deals, none of which throw much light  on anything.	1998-12-23

His writing style and choices of focus reflect that. Nevertheless, he did do extensive valuable research, and come up with some good insights - most  notably in his description of Lennon as embodying the paradoxical  personality of the Beatles as a whole, and his belief that LSD contributed  to Lennon's ability to participate in the good vibes of the sixties when he  himself was an angrier character. The chapter about his childhood is also  good. In the edition I read, there were a few appalling lapses in need of  editorial correction, like when later in life we are told that Lennon meets  some woman on the beach who would haunt him somehow, and that he would not  see again for many years... then it never mentions her again. I still don't  know what Goldman was talking about there. It sounded interesting, I wish  it had been included. All in all, a good read if taken with salt.	1998-11-27
