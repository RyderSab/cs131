The biggest problem is in the typos and mistakes made in the text. It is strange that this 6th edition of the book contains so many typos and mistakes.  <br /> <br />Regardless the drawbacks that are said before, I recomand this book for buying. Anyone who is interested in programmming and programming languages will surely find interesting information in this book.	2005-01-12

I am new in the D&amp;D, and I take the book as a textbook, not as a handbook. I didn't read 1st and 2nd edition of the book. <br />This is book that I read with more interest than I had for the most of the books I read in last time, but I have certain difficulties. <br />It is relatively hard to follow the matter if you read book sequencially. The problem is that the matter is not categorised well, so the terms are used before they are defined. For example Class is the term that is used in 2nd Chapter, but it is defined in the 3dr one. Also, there is table about spells in the 1st chapter, buzt spells are defined in 11th. In the second chapter tte term dodge bonus is used that is defined in the 5th section, and so on. As a mathematician, I know that there is no matter that is so complex that cannot be present in consistent way. Unfortunately, this book isn't written by author(s) that are experienced enough in writting textbooks to make it consistent in way that is described above. <br />It it was a book on the math, the number of stars will be a less than tree, but because it is book on game playing, and it is the only one (as far as I know) that deals with the matter of D&amp;D character creating, so you are, in a way, forced to read this book if you want to be a player, I'll give the 3 stars for this book, and it can be taken as an award not as a punishment for the book.	2003-01-14

There is nothing new in it. The book is made and published after Castanedas death, and that is the only reason why this book is interesting to customers. <br />You cannot read this book because the excerpt on a page hs nothing common with the excerpt on the next page. Only thing what is possible to do with it is to open book randomly and read what is in the page you opened.<br />Even more, I would be less critical if someone would take these excerpts and group them by the theme. That would give some purpose to the book. But in this book excerps are grouped by the book in which they can be found. <br />The way in which the matter is presented in this book is useless.	2002-09-12

The book contains thousands of problems in all fealds of elementary mathematical analysis, and I solve all of them.<br />The only drawback of the book is that the problems in it are rather simple and easy to solve. So, I had to use some other problem books with harder problems. But, if you are not on the study of math, but engeneering study, this will be surely very usefull book to you.	2002-09-12

Secondly, there are many things in this book which are completely out of date. I don't want to say that they are completely unimportant, but there are things in modern programming that are much more important and in wich you can improve your program much more. <br />I read this book, as I said before, as collection of funny and interesting stories.	2002-09-12

In 10th chapter author presents 11 spiritual agreements. My opinion is that 11 agreements presented here are not so powerful as don Miguel's 4 agreements. In fact, Bernadette Vigil said the same thing as Miguel Ruiz but with much less powerful words.<br />11th Chapter gives some exercises and practices as guidelines for those who want to walk on Toltec path. This is, in my opinion,  the greatest part of the book. It is practical, and gives you the idea how to start and how to proceed on the path. <br />If you look at this book regardless to don Miguel's books, than this book is great book, and may even deserve 5 stars. But if you read books written by don Miguel before you read this book, you will have some feeling that the book is not so original nor so powerful.	2002-05-20

The book explains basic programming mathods, such as dynamic programmind, devide and conquer, backtracking etc.<br />The book also covers some new fields that are not covered in, for example, Cormens Introduction to Algorithms, such as randomization, genetic algorithms etc.<br />At the end of the book you can find very interesting catalog of algorithmic problems. <br />I highly reccomend this book. It is modern and very nice written.	2001-05-28

I have it for 15 years.<br />This book is second edition of the book Algorithms + Data Structures = Programming, without Compiler construction, so the formula for it can be<br />(Algorithm + Data Structures = Programming) - Compiler Construction = Algorithms &amp; Data Structures.<br />I bought it because of its famous author, N. Wirth, the creator of Pascal, Modula and Oberon progarmming languages. <br />But the book was a dissapointment for me. The matter in the book is presented in very strange order. There are no field in the book that is explained complete. For example, there are many sorting algorithms in the book, internal as well as external, but some basic sorting algorithms and techniques are not explained. Quicksort algorithm is explained without explaining underlying devide-and-conquer method, etc.<br />If you considering to by some book from the field of compute algorithms and data structures, there are many better books to buy than this one.	2001-05-28

You can see that from my grades of other his books. But this book is dissapointment for me.<br />I read some other experiental and companion books that were much better, for example Teachings of don Carlos or Celestine Prophecy - an experiental guide.<br />In all these books the diary writing as a method is included too, but in the Four Agreements Companion Book the writing in the diary or notebook is the only method. In very short time it becomes boring.<br />Maybe if it was not a book of Miguel Ruiz I would grade it with greater mark, but because Ruiz is so briliant writer, I'll give 3 to this book.<br />My opinion is that last part of Four Agreements, last part of Mastery of Love and the book Beyond the Fear are much better experiental guides for Miguels teachings.	2001-05-24
