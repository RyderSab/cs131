Jasmyn spies Kyle on campus and radars on making him her man. Put the two together and the combination is downright disgraceful. Kyle, not too stable in being able to stick to his first mind impression, succumbs to Jasmyn's lusts and the rest is \\"shameless\\".    When did Jasmyn's over zealous need for men begin... at the sudden tragic death of her father? Or girlfriend was just happy to be care-free in college knowing she had backup - cousins that would break a few arms and legs if she needed it done??? Maybe it was the thought of others knowing her mother was a mental basket case and big brother is on  lock-down...whatever the case Jasmyn went \\"buck\\" wild when it came to men...girlfriend was off the meter!    Why was Kyle such a \\"patsy\\"...was it daddy's image at home? An over baring moms? Just a bookworm and no common sense? Why didn't he just pursue Tianna instead of punking for the most part?    The story is written in 1st person in the voices of Jasmyn and Kyle, with Jasmyn telling her side of the story first. It begins with Jasmyn in a confidential session with an HIV/AIDS victim. We have 2 yr. old, Jayda, also the mercy of this disease. Jayda's mom, Tianna is the childhood love of Kyle, engaged to be married. Tianna and Jasmyn are committed together in a manner you wouldn't suspect.     The reader never finds out the culprit behind the sad demise of Jasmyn. Religion and Christian principles are tapped on, revealing the need for a stronger commitment to ones' self and God.    The novel is well written and suggested for an eye opener to the beast of HIV/AIDS. This is one book that has a \\"believable\\" story to share.	2005-08-12

This book was written with a different twist from the other street books; sharply expressing and affirming another voice of the \\"ride-or-die\\" female living in the hood in hopes to escape the confines of \\"the system\\" and live an upscale, respectable better quality of life. Her humor in the book masks the pain which Modesty endured to soar above the destruction designed to take her under and keep her there.    She also includes in her writing not only the ghetto dimension of the black voice, but also the middle, as well as the upper scale of the Black experience of survival. She hits all the ranges in this novel.    Modesty (a.k.a. \\"Motley\\") rose above the coop of chickenheads, although she still had a power struggle to keep her chaotic love life in order, she successfully prevailed and achieved the possibility of acceptance and recognition in the mainstream of life.    The book was a quick read and the story rolled nicely along. I enjoyed the book. Humor, drama, pain and words of knowledge, as well as encouragement were imparted by the author. Modesty didn't give up and she made it successfully.     She motivated herself on the strength of her grandmother's love first and then her family. Her mother was a down-chick who kept it real with her family, but never denied to initiate the chance for her family to advance in life. Modesty took what was given to her; she worked what she had. From the wide radius of being pampered to the date rape, it was a hard fight, but she came out a winner.    SHE WAS A SURVIVOR!!!	2005-07-21

MoShines' novel is a gritty, raw tale of the never-ending cycle evolving within the drug empire and the players entangled in the game. Embarrassingly graphic, crude and openly exposed! The author has penned a gripping tale revealing harsh realities that possess, terrorize, cripple and paralyze those who claim to have a handle on their destiny, yet all the while sinking deeper in the mire of street life. Sean Coleman, (gone undercover for Internal Affairs for the NYPD) has no clue how he has suddenly placed his entire life and career in jeopardy while being partnered with shady Detective Jay Robinson.  The author has powerfully and skillfully woven a spiritual message for readers to encourage faith beyond the breeding of life's cruelty to cultivate hope despite the merciless hand dealt to those in life who consider themselves with no other choice than what they see before themselves. The unexpected surprises and action in the book were excellent! I enjoyed this book and highly recommend it to those who want something different to read.	2005-07-07

Maybe Ms. Tilles used fantasy (and creatively) to conclude her story. It's the story of a young woman and her battle to fit in society and be happy. I DO RECOMMEND this book to read. I read it in 1 day. It keep me turning the pages. I don't want to give away her storyline, because readers who buy the book will definitely enjoy reading Ms. Tilles' story.

The female characters were well represented in every aspect from streetlife to the corporate world. His mother was unbelievable - she couldn't/wouldn't be mine!... This book brought tears, laughter, anger, hate...and had me screaming out loud! My heart broke with Nasir's father had his encounter.  The levels of betrayal and lust are taboo. To have a mother love her son so deeply and selfishly, and then to later betray him to the utmost was scandalous!!!...and for what???!!!...and not even giving thought to her own grandchild????

The main characters are Sincere & Suave (2 perfect? people in love)...The female character Sincere was an ingrate & \\"stupidly\\" irresponsible to the one man who truly loved her. He did a 3 year bid in jail and their relationship was tested. The male character named Suave was a man  who was dealt an unfair hand in life, yet he maintains character to push forward. The story is not predictable - don't try to guess. There are \\"several\\" surprises in the story. There are some empowering messeges written in this novel, just as much as there is drama and tragedy. The only flaw I have with this book is the author crossed that taboo line...I won't say what it is...read this book for yourself.  My favorite part of the book was the boxing scene in the gym, ( I won't say much more). This book skillfully wraps up a 3 book trilogy (NO EXIT & BLOCK PARTY) and concludes questions that were unanswered in his first 2 novels. Nice work, Mr. Banks....what's next????	2004-08-27

Relentless Aaron unveils the rawest and most explicit literary work of the world(s) of Kingpins and illicit drug industry. No one is exempt from exposure in this game. The intelligence of the U.S. Goverment at ALL levels are revealed in their strategies and involvement with the unlawful drug industry. The settings range from the deepest inner most parts of Columbia, South America(the forests of Bogota - the make shift labs hidden in huts of the rainforests and jungles; the parts tourists elude) to the well known parts of NYC; Long Island and South Beach, Miami. The involvement of the lowest street-runner to the epitome of the exclusive cartels of the drug empire will have you paranoid from the knowledge imparted in this book. Your pysche will be challenged through the personalities written in this book. They are fiction, yet so real!  The personalities written are so well created and developed - from the people in the 'hood to the powerful government high ranking officials. This is not a typical book where you can even begin to guess results for the characters. What you think really isn't what is seems. This author plays tag with the thoughts of your mind. It's a \\"hit and run\\" game with the author as you try to resolve and conclude matters in this novel. I recommend this book to all serious readers.

The suspense is intense in the storyline!  The story is much more than just sex (and yes it's there...but not the way you think it is); it's the murders and beatings (and not of who you would think), the deception, the glamour, the travel and too many more things to mention ( I don't want to give away the book), will have your brains twisted and going through roller coaster emotions when you read this novel. It's even comical at points... PUSH (by the same author) was a great read as well,...but Platinum Dolls is in a whole different category..

I was pleased that someone took the courage to write about this controversial topic, one that is repeatedly destroying relationships in people's lives today. The characters were bondafide and realistic. Mr. Anthony writes  with a sophistication that he actually zones you into the nature of \\"each\\" character. The  persecution and torment that Lance, the main character, endures through male ego, quilt,fear and shame is written so vividly it makes you speak out loud to the characters. Lance's selfish lust is detrimental to everyone involved in his life (wife, son, friends, etc). The author left no stone unturned in the describing the nature and damage that a relationship of infidelity causes. Mr. Anthony has mastered in his book the reality of a man's lustful affliction; how he's actually out of control concerning his desire for sex and how his Christian wife submitted to humiliation and forgave him. I don't want to tell the story; but buy the book! You will not have read anything like it before. Despite this tormenting problem of the main character, the author has written humor that is bound to make you laugh out loud also. This book is without question destined to help both men & women in relationships. It's a book of deliverance for those who are  desparately hurting in this area. It definitely has a good and powerful messege. It's excellently written with Christian morals and ethics that are sure both surprise and please the reader. It's realistic. This book is an exceptional choice for book clubs! I applaud Mr. Anthony for the backbone to expose and confront this topic. It was so needed. The ending of the book is conclusive in itself, or the author can continue with a part II.  I am eager to read the next work of Mr. Anthony entitled \\"LADIES NIGHT\\".  Bring it on, Mr. Anthony; congratulations on a job well done!	2004-05-20

The author had much  imagination when writing this story. The  mistunderstandings between he characters are quite real and possible. I can't wait for \\"Rectangle of Sins\\", now that they have a newborn baby involved. Great story!	2004-05-18

The novel reads as raw, intense & grimey. The characters in the novel draw & grip your attention and emotions as you read. I read BLINDED, which precedes this novel on which Grimey is based. Although both books can stand on their own, I do recommend reading both books just the same. This story is authentic and very well developed. Kashamba Williams has brilliantly woven the emotions portrayed by the street hustle as it effects the hustler's family, children, friends  as well as the so-called church folk. The conclusion will leave you grieving for some characters, while cheering for others. There are many strong and prominate points  of wisdom given throughout the book. The poetry by the author was also deep and soul wrenching expressing what we want to say, but just don't know how. I strongly suggest this as a MUST READ!! This book is worth buying for you and for a friend. It's a serious read challenging also your own conscious and decisions.	2004-04-23

This is an engaging novel about the underworld of betrayal, murders, thugs, killers, gangsters, big money, crooked politicians and erotic woman who serve them. It follows the ups and downs of Reginald \\"Push\\" Jackson; beginning when he was a teenager of 13 and had to care for his younger sister Crystal because of the violent death of their parents. \\"Push\\" struggles through the novel to be true to himself and those he loves.

Sweet Redemption by Ms Moody is a pungent novel about love and the costs and trials can demand from us. The story of Shannelle drawns you instantly into this novel. Her husband Alex is a controller (but rightfully so- given his circumstances). It's to accept what Shannelle has to endure. Ms Viv ( Shanelle's so-called mother) is a character that needs to be reckoned with. The characters are well written in this plot. The novel will keep you reading until you finish. I look forward to \\"Love's Twilight\\" (the sequel) - there has to be some justice for Shanelle.  BRAVO, Ms. Moody - an excellent novel again!	2004-01-14

Ms. Moody	I enjoyed this story about a young lady by the name of Shanelle as she transforms from a teenager to a young lady..The trails she has to endure is nothing for a teen to endure, nor should a grown woman need to be tested in such a manner.  She has courage, determination and preserveres despite little and no lhelp from her father. Her mom is WICKED to her; her brother is a mystery and a terrorists in their home. It makes you wonder when he is going to kill the family members. The things he does is gross. You must read this novel. The twists and plots are unbelievable!	2004-01-14

This novel is a national bestseller waiting to be discovered.  The book is raw, real & uninhibited. The twists & plots in this book will keep you turning the pages. The writing style of this author is  both skillful and talented.  It's a novel of gangstas, hustlers, thugs and the women who love them. Reginald \\"Push\\"  Jackson is the main character who will captivate your attention and draw you  into this book. It deals with the rights and wrongs in the urban streetlife.
