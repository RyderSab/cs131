It definitely wasn't.  Although I stayed hooked long enough to finish it, I was disappointed.<br />\\"Harm None,\\" the first of the Rowan Gant mysteries, begins with the ritualistic death of a coven leader.  Police investigator Ben Storm unofficially requests that his Wiccan friend Rowan Gant examine crime-scene photos because the official police expert does not know what to make of the pentagram and other \\"occult\\" evidence found in the murdered woman's home.  Apparently, the official police \\"expert\\" is incapable of simple Internet searches or is extremely prejudiced against witches because he is unable to interpret evidence that anyone with the most rudimentary knowledge of Wicca would understand.  Gant concludes that more murders are likely to follow, and soon joins the police in a race against the clock to catch the killer before he strikes again.<br />One of the more interesting aspects of the novel is the way Gant uses psychic visions and dreams to solve the murders.  He experiences the murders from the victims' perspective, resulting in some of the most disturbing passages in the book.  (More on this later.)  At one point, the first victim hands him tarot cards in a dream.  I must say that this was one of the first times that I have agreed with the meanings that a novel assigned to tarot cards.  Too often, authors and filmmakers use tarot as a plot devise to get everyone freaked out over a literal interpretation of the Death card.  To his credit, M.R. Sellars even includes several Minor Arcana tarot cards.  (For those unfamiliar with tarot, Minor Arcana are equivalent to the suits in regular playing cards.  The Major Arcana include the \\"picture\\" cards like the Hanged Man, the Empress, the Lovers, etc., and typically are the ONLY tarot cards that appear in readings in fiction or film.)<br />Psychically experiencing the murders from the victims' perspective was an unusual twist, but this approach made \\"Harm None\\" very disturbing.  I don't consider myself terribly squeamish.  I loved \\"Silence of the Lambs\\" and am a fan of the Kay Scarpetta mysteries (whose heroine is a medical examiner).  I had a hard time getting through the mutilation details in this novel, however.<br />Overall, I found the dialogue in \\"Harm None\\" stilted and clich&eacute; ridden. The police officers seem to spend more time making trite anti-Wicca comments than doing the legwork to solve the crime.  The characters more resembled cardboard cutouts than memorable people.  Sellars could have done more with Gant's Wiccan wife, Felicity.  Mostly Felicity frets over the danger that her husband faces and then insists on joining him in the investigation.  Unfortunately, they are no Nick and Nora. Storm, the investigating officer, is a Native American from an unnamed tribe.  Sellars apparently made him a Native American merely so that he could make paleface/Tonto jokes part of his dialogue with Gant.  His heritage does not make him much more open to alternative spirituality.  Among the other stock characters sent over from \\"central casting\\" are a nosy TV news reporter, a take-over-the-investigation FBI agent, and some practically faceless Wiccans.  The Gant family pets seem to have more personality.<br />Perhaps the most unsatisfying aspect of the novel was that we never learn what ritual the ritualistic killer was trying to perform.  At least in \\"Silence of the Lambs,\\" we got to see where the twisted mind of the killer was going.  Not so here.  The horrific mutilations, pentagrams, mysterious phrases, broken mirrors, etc. merely serve as window dressing to doll this mystery up and make it \\"Wiccan.\\"<br />If you are truly interested in reading \\"Harm None,\\" save your money and check it out from the library, or at least by a cheap used copy.	2004-04-13
US	50895531	R28FNWZZIZ0V8V	1564146200	595961175	Wicca for Couples: Making Magick Together	Books	3	21	21	N	N	Title applies only to the second half of the book	If I had skimmed this book at a bookstore, rather than buying it based on Amazon reviews, I never would have bought it.  I was looking for a book that emphasized ways that my partner and I could practice Wicca together.  Based on the title, I thought that's what I was getting.  I was disappointed.  Before I address the specifics of my disappointment, I want to note that the second half of \\"Wicca for Couples\\" does contain beautiful ideas for couple-oriented rituals.  The handfasting ritual struck me as especially lovely, and as something that could easily be modified to make non-Wiccans comfortable while still retaining spiritual aspects important to Wiccans.<br />A.J. Drew's point is that too often in religious communities-whether Wiccan or Christian-we tend to forget the family and neighborly focus.  By turning covens into artificial families, we have tended to forget the everyday living of the ideas we express in ritual.  He notes that originally these practices were based in real community, where extended families and neighbors participated together.  While I agree that leaving religion behind at the ritual or at church is a common failing of several religions, I disagree with Drew's apparent contention that close-knit communities never really become like real family. My own circle of friends does act like family, caring for each other when sick, helping each other through difficulties, etc., to a greater extent than I ever experienced from my biological family.<br />Since few of my friends and none of my family are Wiccan, I appreciated Drew's idea that we can incorporate our spiritual practices into the real-life practices that we share with those closest to us.  Drew provides a basic outline for Wiccan rituals with parallels to real-life practices.  For instance, he likens smudging to putting guests at ease.  He even suggests that if you want to actually smudge non-Wiccan guests as they arrive, you can honestly tell them that smudging is a Native American tradition.<br />I also appreciated Drew's reminder that we need to do more than pay lip service to the idea that we honor God along with the Goddess, and that we should honor them in their relationship to each other.  He makes an excellent point that if we are drawn to a particular Goddess, we also should examine the relationship that she had with the God most frequently associated with her, such as Hera and Zeus, Shiva and Parvati.<br />I purchased \\"Wicca for Couples\\" hoping to find ideas for couple-based celebrations of the Sabbats.  Drew does not cover this.  He suggests rituals only for births, handfasting, handparting, and dating.  Since his approach to ritual is to encourage couples to make up what's meaningful to them, his approach of only providing a few examples is understandable.  Nevertheless, I tend to look to more specific examples and adapt, rather than making something up completely on my own.  If your style is like mine, you might not find this book as helpful.  If your style were more like Drew's, then you more likely would find his book useful.<br />Next, my disappointments:<br />Drew does not get to the \\"couple rituals\\" section until about 100 pages into the book.  Since the book is barely more than 200 pages long, a substantial part of the book does not focus on what the title promises-\\"making magic together.\\"  Instead, Drew focuses on how Wicca developed from being a traditional fertility religion to effectively becoming \\"sterilized.\\"  He spends an inordinate amount of the book analyzing how the Farrar and Buckland approaches to Wicca diverge (the latter has not welcomed homo(...) and has removed references to (...) in the Charge of the Goddess; the former welcomes homosexuals and retains reference to (...) in the Charge).<br />I was looking for a book on how I could incorporate my partner into my Wiccan practices, not a history lesson.  When I do read history, I especially appreciate an author who provides a good analysis of WHY things happened, not just what happened.  Drew never gets to the \\"why.\\"<br />Until he gets to the section on couple rituals, Drew's tone is VERY negative.  I have never encountered such extremely critical and judgmental language in any Wiccan writings before.  His style was far more reminiscent of what I encountered in my fundamentalist Christian upbringing.  Drew could have made his same points in a far more positive, affirming way, rather than spending half his book condemning how others practice their religion.<br />Finally, I have to address a comment that he made in arguing that educators should be personally successful in the subjects they teach.  For instance, Drew contends that successful marriage counselors should have successful marriages. He draws a parallel to parenting, and states, \\"Abused children tend to grow up to be child abusers; molested children tend to grow up to be child molesters...\\"  (p. 65).  Although Drew provides footnotes for the flavor of Granny Smith apples and his preference for rock salt versus sea salt in another ritual (p. 212), he provides no statistics supporting his perpetuation of the \\"abused becomes abuser\\" myth.  I have professional training in this area.  Sarah Buehl, a nationally recognized expert on domestic violence, states that while abusers typically were abused as children, to say that abused children tend to grow up to abuse is absolutely incorrect. I tend to believe Buehl rather than the owner of a pagan bookstore on this point.  When I encounter such blatant inaccuracies, I tend to question other \\"facts\\" presented by the author.<br />Overall, if you skip over the first five chapters, \\"Wicca for Couples\\" is not a bad starting point for developing rituals that you can share with your partner and family.  Drew does point out that more needs to be done within Wicca.  Unfortunately, his book still leaves plenty of room for others to develop inclusive, affirming couple-based rituals.  I definitely did not find what I was looking for.	2004-04-08
US	50895531	R379A4DEESRKY1	0743483677	997529424	Getting the Love You Want Workbook: The New Couples' Study Guide	Books	5	174	178	N	N	The best gift you can give yourself as a couple	Despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary, our society looks upon marriage as the prelude to living \\"happily ever after.\\"  When marriage does not lead to this expected happiness, typically we believe that is because we have chosen the wrong person, and that the solution often is to divorce and find Mr. or Ms. Right.<br />Harville Hendrix does a fantastic job explaining why this approach does not work.  In \\"Getting the Love You Want Workbook,\\" Dr. Hendrix briefly reviews his theory about how couples become attracted-and how this basis of attraction frequently sows the seeds for relationship problems.  The meat of the book is a 12-week series of exercises for couples.<br />If you're not familiar with Dr. Hendrix's Imago theory from either \\"Getting the Love You Want\\" (written for couples) and \\"Keeping the Love You Find\\" (written for singles), and are considering getting this workbook, you really need to read \\"Getting\\" too. (My partner and I started the workbook exercises without having read all of \\"Getting\\" but we both were familiar with the Imago from \\"Keeping\\" and from previous counseling experiences.)<br />So what is this Imago and what exercises will you find in the workbook?<br />According to Dr. Hendrix, we search for partners who embody both the positive and negative traits we experienced from our family of origin/childhood caretakers.  By finding a partner with these familiar traits, including traits that we do not have, we compensate for the positive parts of ourselves that we cut out in childhood.  We also have a chance to heal childhood wounds in our partner and ourselves.  Dr. Hendrix's exercises are designed to help couples develop a \\"conscious marriage\\" in which they change to become the person their partner needs in order to heal, and their partner does the same.<br />The workbook exercises begin by having the couple develop a mutual vision of their ideal relationship.  In their second session, the couple works on a mirroring, validating, and empathizing communication technique.  The next several sections focus on identifying one's Imago, and learning about the partner's Imago.  Further exercises address ways that couples close themselves off to each other, renewing romance, containing anger, and solidifying the changes made during the process.<br />When I began the Imago exercises, I was startled to discover ways in which my current and former partners-men who I considered to be very different-had a stunning amount of good and bad traits in common with my parents.  Of course, that is Dr. Hendrix's point.  When you find someone who reminds of you all the positive things you remember from your family of origin, you unconsciously also are attracted to negative traits that they bring with them.<br />The pacing and organization of the workbook exercises worked really well.  Although the workbook is based on the exercises at the end of \\"Getting,\\" I thought the exercises here are organized much better.  The workbook has couples develop better communication skills before identifying their Imago-a change from the book.  My partner and I, who were barely speaking to each other the week before we started this workbook, really felt connected after completed the relationship vision exercise.  And although we both were familiar with the \\"mirroring\\" communication technique, in which you paraphrase the other person's statement, I found that Dr. Hendrix additional steps of validating the statements with comments like \\"I see\\" or \\"I understand\\" and them emphasizing made me feel really heard when I had touchy issues to discuss and, conversely, made me feel more understanding toward my partner when he had things to tell me that I didn't necessarily want to hear.<br />Following the exercises in order is important.  My partner and his former wife did the anger containment exercise in marriage counseling, without having completed the earlier steps, and found this exercise unhelpful.  Doing later-session exercises without first rebuilding connection through developing a mutual relationship vision, building communication skills and acquiring understanding about the wounds the partner needs likely would be harmful to a relationship.<br />I would recommend \\"Getting the Love You Want\\" and the companion workbook to any couple who wants to strengthen their relationship.  My one caveat would be that this approach does not seem appropriate for relationships with serious substance abuse and/or domestic violence issues.<br />By the way, initially I was skeptical about whether we really needed the workbooks, but I am glad we bought them.  The exercises are laid out much more clearly, and the amount of time you need to set aside each week is specified at the beginning of each session.  Incidentally, the authors recommend purchasing two workbooks, which my partner and I did we do not live in the same city, but a cohabiting couple probably could share one workbook and complete the exercises in separate notebook.<br />My only criticism is Dr. Hendrix's decision to discuss relationships as \\"marriages,\\" despite emphasizing that couples in unmarried committed relationships can benefit from his approach.  More inclusive terminology would have been welcome.	2004-04-02

Many Wiccan and Pagan books focus on family connections, love, and other aspects of home life.  Money and careers are addressed more from the standpoint of doing rituals at home that will affect one's professional life, rather than expressing one's spirituality in the workplace.  Granted, that's always a dicey proposition, especially for Wiccans.<br />Z. Budapest manages to pack a lot in her fun, tiny book.  She starts by describing her image of the Wild Woman, a preverbal creature who howls, moans, grumbles and purrs, and who makes us fall in love at inopportune times with inappropriate persons.  Wild Woman gets bored at work, and need a place where they feel grounded.  Budapest encourages women to create an unobtrusive \\"power spot\\" with tiny stones, perhaps a bird's nest, or other precious tiny things where the Wild Woman will feel at home-in other words, creating a tiny bit of beauty and tranquility in one's workplace.<br />One aspect of \\"Goddess in the Office\\" that I particularly appreciated is the extent to which Budapest put me in tune with the energy of each day.  I do find that I have a hard time focusing on work when I come in on Mondays, that I do get down to business on Tuesdays, that by Wednesday I'm looking to what I need to do next week, etc.  Becoming aware of these energies helps to address the particular challenges that they pose.<br />The chapters in \\"Goddess in the Office\\" are organized by the seven days of the week.  Budapest begins each chapter by focusing on the day's energy, contemplating on the meaning behind the day's name (for instance, Moonsday has dreamy, introspective connotations), and the goddess associated with that day.  (Continuing with the moon theme, Monday's Goddess is Artemis.)  After exploring the symbolic meaning of the day, Budapest then suggests scents, gems, and colors to express the day's energy.  I particularlyliked her suggesting various colors, depending on the energy that would be needed on a particular day.  Each chapter also includes a handful of work-related spells (which don't need to be done on a particular day) and ends meditation exercise (to be done at home) for connecting with one's Wild Woman.<br />Budapest acknowledges the importance that weekends play in achieving balance in our work lives.  While the Saturday and Sunday chapters seem lighter than the workday chapters, they do provide some good ideas for renewing one's energy and getting ready for the next week.<br />The spells in \\"Goddess in the Office\\" are the only one's I've found that specifically address the kinds of challenges that arise at work.  Budapest includes spells for computer problems, giving a speech, blessing a project, protecting against sexual harassment, etc.  You can follow her suggestions discretely with easily accessible supplies.  For instance, the spell for purifying the office involves soaking lemon verbena or a pinch of sea salt in spring water, and scattering the blessed water around the office before co-workers arrive at work.<br />\\"Goddess in the Office\\" isn't Wicca 401, by any stretch of the imagination.  You're not going to delve into deep spiritual issues.  But you just might have fun!  The little line drawings of the naked Wild Woman serve as a great reminder that we cannot ignore our playful selves for too long just because we also have to earn a paycheck.	2004-03-31

Every woman who has wished that she could get a gay man to take her guy shopping--and every hetero man who would like to figure out how to unstick himself from the tarpit of cultural ignorance--has managed to make \\"Queer Eye for the Straight Guy\\" a major hit.  Absorbing all that information in a fast-paced TV show, however, can become challenging.  The Fab 5's book retains the same breezy, frank, gay-joking tone of the show while providing an easy-to-use reference that guys can come back to--or gals can use to drop a subtle hint to their favorite caveman.<br />Sure, guys could probably get the same information by reading cooking and decorating magazines, subscribing to GQ, calling the local Mary Kay rep, and (gasp) listening to women, but the Fab 5's guide does a great job putting together key information on food, grooming, decorating, fashion and culture in a fun and focused way.<br />\\"Right now, in cities and towns across this great land, there are men eating pork-n-beans out of the can, grooming like Neanderthals, and dressing themselves in the darkness of utter couture-ignorance.  (The tragedy!) You needed us, and we were there.\\"<br />The chatty format and clean layout makes the information accessible and quick to find.  Each section contains helpful 5-point lists. Short straight-guy FAQs, Q&As and \\"hiptips\\" sprinkle the chapters with easily digested ideas. The writing style is a crack-up, filled with the gay-straight double entendres that make the show fun to watch.<br />The guide is divided into the same five areas that the Fab 5 address in their make-over show:<br />* Food & wine, by Ted Allen of Esquire, contains enough cocktail recipes to get you through all seasons, suggests a few easy ways to prepare bar snacks, reviews some basic wine information, provides recipes for several simple but elegant meals, and (perhaps most helpful of all) tells guys how to \\"fake it\\" with no-cook dinners.  The chapter concludes with five tips for dressing a dinner plate--something few guys know unless they've worked in restaurants.<br /><br />* Grooming, by stylist Kyan Douglas, covers hair styling products, nose-hair trimmers (\\"Dude, it's power tools for your nostrils!\\"), skin care and shaving.  I found the skin-care section particularly helpful since I've been trying to get my boyfriend to pay attention to this topic, but haven't been able to explain to him why he needed to do certain things.  Kyan does a good job explaining why guys should pay attention to these topics, and manages to do it in amusing \\"guy talk.\\"<br /><br />* Decorating, written by interior designer Thom Filicia.  While key points about grooming can be covered well in brief, an overview of decorating in the same amount of space is bound to leave a lot out.  Fortunately, Thom doesn't attempt to be all-encompassing.  He emphasizes thinking about how you use your space, and points you in directions for learning more about styles you find appealing.  Creating architectural details, particularly in bland apartments, has been a strength of Thom's designs on \\"Queer Eye,\\" and he does a good job in the guide explaining how to do this.  His \\"5 Quick Cleanup Tasks Before Company Comes Over\\" hilariously ends with a reminder that \\"porn, of any sort, no matter how soft, should be hard to bump into.\\"<br /><br />* Fashion, by stylist Carson Kressley (easily the most outrageous of the five), could be subtitled \\"how to look good without looking like your mommy dressed you.\\"  He covers wardrobe basics, ways to dress up and dress down shirts, 5 ways to wear blazers, what tie knots go best with different collar styles (but not how to tie them), and cuts of jeans.  His suit-buying information is fabulous.  I especially loved his \\"evolution of the suited man,\\" featuring a pyramid of swatches, starting at the top with the basic navy blue for the guy who only wears a suit when pressed into service as a pallbearer, and extending, eventually, to \\"sponsoring your tailor's green card\\" (a dozen swatches for the extreme dandy).<br />* Culture, by actor/singer/dancer Jai Rodriguez, contains a lot of great \\"5 thing\\" lists: public speaking, straight-guy  faux pas, hosting tips, working a cocktail party, alternatives to dinner-and-a-movie dates, places to pick up women (more classily titled \\"look for love\\"), birthday gifts, and tszujing a date.  Cell phone and e-mail do's and don'ts are tips that almost everyone, male and female, could use.  While Jai's cultural tips on the show tend to be very specific to the guy/couple involved--and that's one of his points, *make it personal*--his cultural guide contains some more general ways that guys can become more cultured, like websites for finding good books and movies.<br />The Fab 5's approach works because they affirm who the individual is and make over wardrobes and homes based on what the guy likes, not on some one-size-fits-all approach.  \\"Our goal isn't to turn you into someone else,\\" they note in their introduction.  They also stress, in very funny ways, that adopting their ideas is not going to turn heterosexual men into effete things who will attract gays.<br />And what's \\"tszujing,\\" you want to know? The guide ends with a glossary that explains this \\"Queer Eye\\" term, and contains other amusing definitions. My favorites: \\"Mise-en-place: Culinary term, from the French for having your **** together.\\" \\"Empathy: Listening your way to getting lucky.\\"	2004-03-25
US	50895531	RIYM7J9VDF13D	0688126960	931783251	Louisa May: The World and Works of Louisa May Alcott	Books	4	5	5	N	N	Gives new understanding to her sources of inspiration	As most fans of \\"Little Women\\" know, author Louisa May Alcott based the story on the lives of herself and her three sisters, Anna (the sweet mothering one), Elizabeth (the musical one), and May (the artist).  \\"Louisa May\\" is a wonderful way to discover how Louisa turned a sometimes very difficult childhood into something magical that has stood the test of time.  Photographs of Louisa, her family and their many homes were especially interesting to see.  I couldn't help looking at those without thinking, \\"Ah, so that's what Meg, Beth and Amy looked like.\\"<br />Louisa May Alcott was born in 1832 to a freethinking teacher, Bronson Alcott, and a Boston blueblood, Abigail May Alcott.  Although Abigail (known as Abba) came from a wealthy family, she received little inheritance, and her family soon grew tired of bailing out Bronson from his financial problems.  For much of Louisa's early childhood, the family lived in abject poverty.  Both parents worked in the abolition movement and in other attempts at social reform.  Their friends included many famous transcendentalist thinkers of the day, such as Emerson and Thoreau.  Johnston briefly describes transcendentalism, but not in enough detail that the reader will wind up with a lasting understanding of this nature-based philosophy.<br />Sections of this biography dealing with Bronson's unconventional teaching ideas and techniques and his struggles to maintain a teaching post were perhaps the most fascinating.  The most recent film adaptation of \\"Little Women\\" alludes to some of these problems when one of Meg's society friends comments that her father's school had to close because he admitted a black girl as a student.  \\"Louisa May\\" provides a few further details on this incident, which actually occurred, noting that the child may have been the daughter of free blacks who knew the Alcotts through the abolition work.  Bronson also found himself out of a teaching job for focusing on philosophy rather than the three Rs, including sex education in his curriculum, and preaching his own religious beliefs to his students.<br />While Bronson's educational approach cost him jobs in America, a book published by his assistant made him famous in England.  Following a visit to that country, he returned to Massachusetts with several like-minded hangers-on and decided to found a utopian farm.  Charles Lane, his chief ally in this effort, encouraged Bronson to a life of abstinence.  Lane's monk-like approach to life included rigid lessons for the Alcott girls, meals consisting mostly of bread, potatoes, and water eaten without plates (the Alcotts already were vegetarians), and ultimately an attempt to separate Bronson from his family.<br />Johnston's description of how Abba managed to turn things around for the family is inspiring and contradicts stereotypes that many have about 19th century women's submissiveness to their husbands.  Reading \\"Louisa May\\" left me longing for more information about Bronson and Abba Alcott, and their unconventional lives.<br />Like Jo in \\"Little Women,\\" Louisa sought to help support her family as she got older.  She did sewing, cleaned houses, taught children and, despite discouraging publishers, sold short stories.  When the Civil War broke out, Louisa volunteered as a nurse.  Her nursing experience proved pivotal in her life in several ways:  \\"Hospital Sketches,\\" based on her letters home, established her as a writer.  Her hard work as a nurse, however, destroyed her health.  Although not clear from \\"Louisa May,\\" Louisa worked only three weeks as a nurse before going home sick.<br />The sections about her writing her famous children's books are less fascinating than the chapters on her early life, perhaps because it's hard to read about Louisa's struggles with poor health.  At this point, Johnston briefly describes the plots, mentions which publisher the book was written for, and a few other details about what was going on in Louisa's life during its writing.  Johnstoncould have given better context to Louisa's financial success.  Stating that she earned $1,000 a year seems like an improvement over the $30 a year the family struggled to survive on during her childhood, but for readers unfamiliar with mid-19th century wages, it would be hard to see this sum as representing financial security.<br />I was surprised at how quickly I read \\"Louisa May.\\"  It had sat on my shelf for years before I finally picked it up, and then I read it practically nonstop.  My primary disappointment was its lack of footnotes and its lack of a broader bibliography.  I wanted to know more and I wanted Johnston's help in pointing me in that direction.  Then I noticed that the biography was written for \\"11 & Up\\" and understood.  I certainly didn't get the impression from the writing style, that the book was geared to younger readers.<br />Overall, I enjoyed \\"Louisa May\\" very much, and have new respect for her as an independent woman who set out to accomplish goals and lead a life that would have been somewhat unusual for women in her day-and did everything she set out to do!	2003-07-16
US	50895531	R1ARGY96UG9B7E	0670818941	772498023	The Complete Book of Herbs: A Practical Guide to Growing and Using Herbs	Books	5	81	82	N	N	Absolutely EVERYTHING you need from an herb book!	You truly could not ask for a more complete reference on growing and using herbs.  Lesley Bremness' book, beautifully illustrated throughout with sumptuous color photographs, is the first book I turn to for all my herb-related questions, whether they relate to garden planning, how tall a particular herb will grow, or an herbal remedy for dry skin.  She provides extensive, well-organized, easy-to-read information on the cultivation and uses of perhaps 100 herbs, going well beyond the \\"usual suspects\\" to include such herbs as Elecampane, Melilot, and Houseleek.<br />One of the best aspects of the book is its 100+ page \\"Herbal Index.\\"  A full page (sometimes two) is dedicated to each variety, with good-sized color photos depicting the stem, leaf, seed, flower, root, dried flowers, dried leaves, crushed roots, other varieties, etc.  A small photo tops of the growing plant tops a sidebar.  This approach makes herb identification much easier than the books that rely on the garden glam shots where the herb looks gorgeous but its particulars can be difficult to see.  Each herb page begins with a description of any lore historically ascribed to the plan and perhaps the origins of its name.  For instance, the Borage description notes that the Old Masters often used the \\"beautiful pure blue\\" flowers to paint the Madonna's robe.<br />The sidebars in the Herbal Index pack an amazing amount of information into a relatively small amount of space: Details about cultivation, including soil and sunlight preferences, harvesting and preservation, and the decorative, culinary, household, cosmetic, and medicinal uses of its various parts.  More details on the uses can be found in the \\"Using Herbs\\" sections.<br />Interspersed in the Herbal Index are certain theme sections depicting a handful of herbs grown for flowers or foliage and salad herbs, for instance.<br />The one drawback to the Herbal Index, as other reviewers have noted, is its arrangement by Latin name, rather than common name.  Since the common name appears in good-sized print, flipping through to find what you're looking for isn't burdensome.  Resorting to the thorough index at the end is another option.<br />This drawback is more than made up for by the thorough information in the Herbal Index and the 100 pages of well-illustrated uses for herbs.  Here, the ideas go well beyond the usual recipes for meals and potpourri.  The Herbal Decorations chapter includes lovely photographs of nosegays annotated with the Victorian language of flowers meanings, herbal garlands, herbal wreaths, and herbal table decorations.  The culinary section features recipes for herbs the average person doesn't think to cook with, such as lovage soup and a marigold glaze for ham.  The Herbs for the Household chapter discusses natural ways to deter pests using herbs, a marjoram-based furniture wax, horsetail \\"scouring pads,\\" plus instructions for herbal dyes, herbal papers, scented ink, herbal toys, and a perfumed box.  A variety of soaps, facial cleansers, bath additives, facial steams, floral waters and hair rinses appear in the Herbs for Beauty chapter.  The Herbs for Health organizes medicinal uses of herbs alphabetically by ailment.<br />The book begins with a section on herb garden design.  Among the themes illustrated are plans for a moonlight garden, a delightful circular children's garden, a Chinese garden, and an Egyptian-style paradise garden.  Bremness also provides plans for gardens ranging in size from containers on a patio to a small corner of a yard to a large all-purpose garden (which seems to truly have a bit of everything).  The planning section is the one place in the book where Bremness relies on some finely detailed color pencil drawings rather than photographs, although she still mixes in a delectable array of inspiring color photos.<br />\\"The Complete Book of Herbs\\" is a resource that herb gardeners, whether novice or experienced, will turn to again and again.

Even though written in 1991, when the murders were still unsolved, this account manages to keep you hooked as the task force tracks down leads and more and more bodies are discovered.  Details about how criminal profiling, then in its infancy, was applied in this case, and about how the Seattle had only recently been preyed upon by another serial killer, Ted Bundy, were quite interesting.<br />The identity of the Green River killer was a subject of perennial speculation as I came of age in the Pacific Northwest in the 1980s.  Who was responsible the unsolved murders of some 49 Seattle and Portland prostitutes?  Who was the man described in a Crime Stoppers press release as \\"the most prolific killer of all time.... More vicious than Jack the Ripper, Ted Bundy, The Boston Strangler and Son of Sam combined.\\"<br />My personal interest in the Green River killings grew when the FBI interviewed my former husband about a guy who briefly had lived with him.  When I picked up \\"The Search,\\" I hoped I might find some insight into what characteristics of this roommate, who committed suicide in late 1984, might have attracted investigators' attention for years.<br />When a suspect was charged in 2001 with killing four Green River victims, police said this suspect was someone they had considered during their earlier investigation.  I thought \\"The Search\\" might shed light on why he came under suspicion initially.  It does-although not by name.  Reviewing information from news websites about the man charged in 2001, and comparing it with an unnamed suspect in the book should help the reader make the connections, however.<br />\\"The Search\\" does provide a fascinating portrait of how the investigation went awry, particularly in the early months.  What emerges is an initially disorganized investigation plagued by political problems, under staffing, and overlooked leads.  The fact that most victims were prostitutes complicated efforts to determine what happened in their final hours since they generally attracted no notice if they got into a car with a stranger, and their absence might go unnoticed by family for days or weeks.  Among the factors hampering the investigation, according to authors Carlton Smith and Tomas Guillen, were:<br />· Contamination of the \\"freshest\\" crime scene-the Green River \\"dump site\\"-where a rafter found several bodies as officers dropped quite a few cigarettes while processing the scene.<br />· Lack of surveillance at places where bodies were discovered.  A few days after the discovery of Dub Bonner, whose murder prompted the investigator to consider that a serial killer might be on the loose, three more bodies were found in the Green River quite close to where Bonner had been left.  Evidence indicated that one victim, Opal Mills, may have been killed and dumped AFTER Bonner's body had been discovered.  Later in the book, the authors discover other indications that the killer revisited \\"dump sites.\\"<br />· Lack of communication between different police jurisdictions, and later between the Green River Task Force and the vice cops who worked The Strip where so many missing prostitutes were last seen.  Smith and Guillen describe how officers on vice surveillance failed to write down license plates of customers frequenting The Strip, and how, at times, vice cops gave the impression that the killings were over, since they had not received current information from the task force.<br />· Disinterest in investigating missing persons reports involving prostitutes.  Given the transient nature of prostitution, law enforcement tended to discount reports of missing prostitutes since many women worked a West Coast circuit to avoid problems with law.  Only later did the task force make a serious effort to come up with a list of missing prostitutes and compare their dental records with unidentified bodies.<br />· Anti-prostitution efforts that helped clean up the prostitution problem on The Strip, but also resulted in numerous witnesses becoming harder to find as they moved elsewhere to pursue their trade.<br />· Intense press coverage that could have made witnesses \\"remember\\" something that they had merely seen reported.  With a shortage of manpower in the early months of the investigation, police sometimes had difficulty getting a chance to interview witnesses before the news media interviewed them.<br />· County politics affected how much clout the King County sheriff and the lead investigator had in pulling together resources to work on the case.  (The same seemed to be true of bodies found near Portland, Oregon, but \\"The Search\\" spends less time exploring what internal department pressures may have affected the Portland police chief's level of cooperation.)<br />· Lack of modern crime-fighting technology.  Tools that we seem to take for granted today apparently weren't standard fare in even urban police departments in the early 1980s, including computers for organizing tips, lasers for detecting trace evidence, and equipment that could compare partial fingerprints to those on file elsewhere.<br /><br />\\"The Search\\" begins with the early river discoveries, and then backtracks to briefly describe the victims' lives just before their disappearances.  From there, the book switches between describing activities of other prostitutes who fell victim and police efforts to solve the crimes.  This straight-forward chronological approach creates some confusion since personal details about a particular victim are described within the timeframe of her disappearance, rather than when her body was discovered.  Since most remains weren't discovered for months or even years after the woman was killed, connecting the discovery with the personal details was difficult.  An index or an appendix with victim information, including disappearance and discovery date, would have been helpful.  Supplemental material in the book does include maps of the sites where bodies were found and photographs of the victims, which helped to individualize them<br />Although the 2001 arrest makes \\"The Search\\" somewhat out of date, the details about how police attempted to investigate this difficult-to-solve series of murders remains very fresh and very fascinating.	2003-06-17

A college friend turned me onto Diane Seed's cookbook, otherwise I might have overlooked such a slim volume, thinking that it didn't have much to offer.  This little cookbook is packed full of terrific pasta recipes, all organized around the featured vegetable or ingredient: mushrooms, lemon, zucchini, walnuts, peas, spinach, etc. Most recipes are quick and simple to make, requiring only a few ingredients.  One of the things I really appreciate about this cookbook is knowing that if I keep a few basic Italian cheeses and other ingredients on hand, I can whip up a really yummy dinner after stopping at the local produce market or farmers market for the fresh vegetables.  Several recipes can be prepared with non-perishable items from the pantry, but don't taste like dinner came from a can.<br />In addition to delicious, easy-to-follow recipes, the illustrations in &quot;Top 100 Pasta Sauces&quot; make it a delight to peruse.	2003-06-06

So often in a fabric store, I run across gorgeous fabric that I absolutely love but can't for the life of me figure out how I would use it in a quilt.  Sometimes it's a large-scale print that wouldn't look right cut into itty-bitty pieces for a traditional pieced quilt.  Sometimes it's a '30s repro novelty print where, again, the scenes would get destroyed if cut.  More recently, it's been the lovely toiles that have come into vogue.<br />Pamela Mostek's &quot;Just Can't Cut it!&quot; provides terrific inspirations for quilts to make from those fabrics.  Designs range from a simple scalloped whole-cloth quilt to a quilt with more intricately pieced diamond sashing that frames the &quot;can't cut it&quot; fabric.  Since most of the design comes from the featured fabric, many of these quilts would be quite simple to piece.<br />The 12 designs include &quot;Japanese Jewels,&quot; a crazy quilt made of Japanese prints, &quot;I Love Liberty,&quot; which takes advantage of a strong horizontal design of a Liberty of London fabric, &quot;Josie's Quilt,&quot; which shows off a '30s repro Red Riding Hood fabric that I've long admired, and several quilts using a lattice design to frame the featured fabric.<br />Those more addicted to hand quilting than to piecing will appreciate the simply to make quilts that will enable them to spend less time with the construction and get right to the quilting.  I should note that Ms. Mostek doesn't provide any ideas of quilting the finished pieces.  Fortunately, the photographs are clear enough that the quilting designs are apparent in most.<br />In addition to providing the piecing designs, Ms. Mostek gives suggestions for selecting companion fabrics that won't compete with the &quot;can't cut it&quot; fabric.  Although she doesn't go into as much detail about companion fabric selection as some quilting books do, she does a good job focusing the short fabric-selection section to this style of quilt, where one fabricwill (or at least should) dominate the design, and the rest are there to act as condiments, so to speak.<br />&quot;Just Can't Cut it!&quot; also contains a brief section on the mechanics of putting a quilt together, including applique and binding.  The book, however, doesn't pretend to be a comprehensive &quot;how-to-quilt&quot; guide, and instead contains a good Resources section for those with questions on color, piecing, etc.<br />My one extremely minor criticism is that, for the most part, Ms. Mostek doesn't show any variations on her designs.  Since the featured fabric serves as such a strong design element, visualizing the quilt made with anything else can be a challenge in some cases.  Fortunately, the one quilt design where this is most true--&quot;I Love Liberty&quot;--does depict the quilt made with a different fabric.<br />The second I ran across this book at my local quilt shop, I knew I had to have it.  One of these days, I will run across another one of those &quot;Love It, But What Would I Do With It?&quot; fabrics and will turn it into a &quot;Just Can't Cut It&quot; quilt.	2003-06-06
US	50895531	RRHVGK4K2EYSL	0914881221	18866123	Celebration of Hearts: A Sampler of Heart Motifs for Quilting, Patchwork and Applique	Books	4	18	18	N	N	A great way to discover what type of quilt patterns you like	The beautiful quilt on the cover sold the book to me.  Since Amazon.com's listing doesn't have a photo, let me describe it.  The cover quilt features a sampler of 12 different heart motifs.  The designs are different enough to make this sampler quilt constantly interesting to sew but the heart motif and the fabric selection unify the quilt much more than many samplers I've seen.<br />Featured in the sampler are the Checkerboard Heart, pieced from small squares; the Log Cabin Heart, with a small heart applique added to this traditional design; Crazy at Heart, a planned crazy patch; Heart Turnaround, which has a simple Amish feel; and Star of My Heart, an Ohio Star variation with hearts.  Creating this sampler will require the quilter to practice skills in intricate piecing, learn to make Prairie Points (little trianges that stick out from the quilt surface), work with curved seams on (appropriately) Curved Heart, and do a fair amount of applique.<br />In addition to the sampler quilt, \\"Celebration of Hearts\\" contains scores of other projects, each based on one of the blocks featured in the sampler: a variety of throw pillows, stuffed animals, an apron, slippers, a sewing bag, etc. Don't be deterred by the '80s looking colors of the cover quilt.  As the quilts depicted inside prove, hearts are a timeless motif that can be incorporated into many looks.  Among the ideas depicted in the book are ways to change the look of the sampler blocks for a southwestern theme, Christmas colors, an Amish look, and many Victorian florals.<br />One weakness of \\"Celebration of Hearst\\" is that it didn't have a lot of basic tips for a beginning quilter.  Since this was the first quilt book I ever bought (fortunately not quite the first quilt I made), I was a bit at a loss to figure out the mechanics of putting my quilt together.  I found that making my borders turn out the right length, based on the measurements provided and how I cut them, was frustrating.  I've since discovered that many more recent quilt books suggest cutting them extra long--something these authors didn't mention.<br />Overall, however, a \\"Celebration of Hearts\\" was an absolute delight to make.  (Okay, everything EXCEPT piecing the Ohio Star block was an absolute delight.)  I absolutely loved the embellishments that they suggested, including the wandering ribbons and hodge-podge sprinkling of buttons that adorn several of the blocks.  Since I was making the sampler from leftover fabric from my bridesmaids' and flower girls' dresses--and was divorced by the time I got around to actually making the quilt--I added one last embellishment that wasn't in the book: I tied my wedding ring to the final block, and was happy to be done with it.	2003-06-06

Why?  The &quot;envelope of this, packet of that...&quot; approach enables me to prepare delicious vegetarian meals with many non-perishable items that I can keep stocked in my pantry plus a few fresh veggies.  &quot;365 Ways&quot; also contains many quick-to-fix recipes.  The prep and cooking time estimates are particularly helpful in meal planning, and generally are right on the money.<br />Recipes are organized in chapters focusing on hors d'oeuvres, soups &amp; stews, bean-based dishes, &quot;meatless main courses,&quot; pasta, &quot;pizzas, pies &amp; vegetable tarts,&quot; salads, grains, &quot;stuffed, wrapped &amp; rolled&quot; items, eggs, sandwiches, vegetable side dishes and dips and sauces to spice up a meal.  Many excellent ethnic recipes are featured, including Gado Gado with a very tasty peanut sauce, a variety of Tex-Mex and Italian-inspired dishes.  The Asparague Flans with Blue Cheese Vinaigrette were delicious enough to convince a impress a former boyfriend who moonlighted as a chef but simple enough to not screw up.  While I generally do not like vegetarian recipes that mimic a meat-based dish, the creamy East-West Meatless Stroganoff, made with walnut balls instead of meatballs, has satisfied vegaterians and meat-eaters alike.  My junk food-only stepchildren were halfway through Charlie's Pizza before they realized that they had just eaten pizza topped with pears, spinach and pecans instead of pepperoni--and what's more, they liked it.<br />Since I'm not a vegetarian, just someone who enjoys a variety of food and meals that aren't planned around a meat dish, I was unconcerned about recipes calling for chicken stock or Worcestershire sauce.  I can't speak for the calorie level either, since I am not good about counting those nasty things.  All in all, despite a few recipes that I decided to modify to make a bit spicier, I haven't been disappointed.  Instructions were easy to follow, and everything turned out extremely well.  The spiral bound spine makes the book easier to use, since it lays flat and pages don't flip on their own while you cook.	2003-06-03

A serial killer is on the loose, gruesomely preying upon cross-dressing boy prostitutes.  Police detectives are making no progress solving the ghastly crimes.  In fact, someone with power or influence seems to be bent on silencing witnesses and thwarting any investigation.  Reform-minded police commissioner Theodore Roosevelt (yes, the same TR who later became president), determined to catch the killer, assembles an unconventional group of investigators headed by \\"alienist\\" Dr. Lazlo Kreizler.  (In the 19th century, when psychology was in its infancy, the mentally ill were considered \\"alienated\\" from themselves and society, and the experts who treated them were known as \\"alienists.\\")<br />Dr. Kreizler's team includes his former Harvard classmate, New York Times crime reporter John Moore; Moore's longtime friend, spitfire heiress-turned-NYPD-secretary Sara Hamilton; and two former mental patients who now work as his servants.<br />To help identify the killer--who leaves behind very few clues, manages to spirit his victims out of locked rooms, and passes through the city unnoticed--the team attempts to develop a psychological profile of the type of person who would be capable of such horrendous deeds.  The novelty of their approach does not win them any fans from the mental-health establishment or most NYPD detectives, and throughout the novel, they attempt to keep their involvement secret.<br />Author Caleb Carr puts his historical background to fascinating use.  \\"The Alienist\\" is filled with rich details about both the seamier underside and more privileged parts of late-19th-century New York City and the then-novel crime detection techniques.  Detectives Lucius and Marcus Isaacson, assigned to assist the investigation, employ the not-yet-accepted science of fingerprinting and other methods of identification in their hunt for the killer.<br />\\"The Alienist\\" is one of the few murder mysteries that I have ever enjoyed reading a second time.  The characters are memorable, dryly amusing at times, and always fascinating.  Carr portrays his victims as humans and individuals, rather than sensationalizing their professions.  The plot, including a race against time once the team predicts when the killer is likely to strike again, moves along at a brisk pace.  The historical detail advances the plot rather than bogging it down.<br />Lovers of historical fiction and detective mysteries will find a treat in \\"The Alienist.\\"	2003-05-28

Va., comprise &quot;Civil War Memoirs of Two Rebel Sisters.&quot;  Mollie Hansford's story begins in 1853 with her marriage to Dr. John Wallis.  Details about her honeymoon trip, the fear in her community inspired by John Brown's raid on nearby Harper's Ferry, and putting up with searches by Union soldiers are particularly fascinating.  Mollie's half-sister, Victoria, remained in the Kanawha Valley in what became West Virginia.  Her writings describe refugeeing at the last minute before the Battle of Scary, coping with the a great flood, and exchanging letters through the &quot;Underground Railroad,&quot; a reference to a secret method of slipping mail through Federal lines, not the route escaped slaves took to freedom.<br />The book ends with a collection of letters that their brother, Carroll M. Hansford, sent from Elmira prison camp, and letters that family members and friends sent to him.  In the letters, the family discusses sending care packages--whether he will have permission to receive such packages, and what they should contain.<br />While the contents of the sisters' writing and their soldier brother's letters are fascinating, the editing of &quot;Two Rebel Sisters&quot; makes their story hard to follow.  Editor William D. Wintz does not distinguish from chapter to chapter which sister's account he is relaying.  In addition, determining whether they recorded their observations about the war in journals written during the war or in post-war remembrances can be difficult.  Since one's memory fades or becomes embellished in retrospect, knowing the timeframe of the writing would be extremely helpful.  The looking-back style suggests that much was written after the war, but again, it's unclear how much time has passed.<br />Wintz suffers from the amateur historian's desire to include absolutely every single nugget of research thathe came across.  If it doesn't fit, he'll make it fit!  While initially I appreciated that he interjected italicized research notes in the middle of the sisters' writing, rather than burying the information in endnotes, some of his details could have stood to be buried.  Whenever he found any fascinating-to-him information about someone mentioned ever-so-briefly in the sisters' writings, he would provide EVERYTHING he discovered, disrupting the flow of the main narrative.<br />What WOULD have been interesting to know is why POWs at Elmira could only receive care packages from families at certain times.  The question of permission figures into many of the Hansford letters, but no rationale is provided for denying POWs little items from home that could make their existence more bearable.  Was it group punishment?  Lack of staff to inspect boxes for contraband?  Wintz apparently never investigated, for if he had, he would have gone on at length on the topic.<br />Finally, although &quot;Two Rebel Sisters&quot; contains some fascinating photographs and what appear to be period illustrations, next-to-no detail is provided about when certain drawings were made or the likely timeframe when certain photographs were taken.  This weakness becomes especially apparent with a picture Wintz decided to include from his personal collection of an older couple dressed in &quot;typical style of the 1860s.&quot;  I have been studying 1850s and 1860s clothing for the past five years, examining originals, documented drawings and documented photographs, and whatever those two are wearing, it bears NO RESEMBLANCE to clothes worn during the Civil War.  With so many excellent images available, the editor's decision to stick in something from his collection seems perplexing.  Discovering an obvious error always makes me question the reliability of the rest of the work.<br />&quot;Two Rebel Sisters&quot; is worth reading for the sisters' accounts.  Take the rest with a grain of salt.	2003-05-20
US	50895531	RHGTKSDXBXODJ	0807126888	131836652	Refugee Life in the Confederacy	Books	5	9	10	N	N	The Civil War as real people (not Scarlett) experienced it	When Americans think about war refugees, we typically think of people made homeless due to conflicts fought on foreign soil.  We tend to forget about the thousands of southerners driven from their homes during the War Between the States.  Mary Elizabeth Massey's \\"Refugee Life in the Confederacy\\" describes the experience of southern refugees in fascinating detail.<br />While diarists provide wonderful detail about their individual lives, and to a certain extent, the lives of others they encountered, Massey's book creates a comprehensive \\"big picture.\\"  Massey makes a key point that one cannot rely on the experiences one or two persons to generalize about the typical refugee experience.  \\"[T]here was no `average' refugee.  A person's financial situation, personal contacts, place of refugee, ingenuity, adjustability to changing conditions, and his good fortune or lack of it combined to make each refugee's circumstances distinctive,\\" she notes.<br />For instance, the ability to find continue one's chosen field of work in a new locale varied greatly depending on profession:  Teachers often could make a planned departure to a new school while college professors more often found themselves out of work as their institutions closed.  Doctors and herbalists were in high demand wherever they went while lawyers had to resort to a different line of work unless they managed to transport their law library.  Some journalists, often targeted by Union forces for publicly airing their views, managed to continue printing from new sites.<br />Massey's work, originally published in 1964, relies on a wide variety of diaries, letters and other first-hand accounts.  She addresses refugee conditions in all the states of the Confederacy, not just the ones that typically receive the most attention due to more famous battles occurring on their soil.  She does not discuss refugees in Maryland and Pennsylvania who fled during the battles of Antietam and Gettysburg, but does briefly mention pro-Union refugees who left home due to conflicts with neighbors over their allegiance.<br />Throughout the book, her writing style remains interesting and somewhat dramatic.  Massey interweaves a broad variety of first-hand accounts into her analysis, adding further interest to her topic.  Period illustrations from Frank Leslie's Illustrated Newspaper and Harper's Weekly further dramatize the plight of the displaced.<br />\\"Refugee Life\\" begins with a brief overview of the some major events in the war that led persons to leave their homes, either temporarily or for the duration.  Massey then turns to factors that led persons to decide to become refugees: scare stories about what the Union Army would do, letters from husbands and sons at war urging their wives and mothers to move to a safer place, newspaper editorials, avoiding conscription, becoming stranded after a visit to a military camp, and the desire to protect men of fighting age, including soldiers on leave, as Union forces drew near.<br />She argues that elite classes were more likely to become refugees than the poor for several reasons: 1) their political involvement would make them targets for Union retribution-and less willing to take the loyalty oath; 2) they more easily could afford to uproot; and 3) they had broader social contacts upon which they could draw.  She notes, however, that refugeeing become a great social leveler.  \\"After the first months it was difficult to distinguish between the classes and backgrounds of those displaced,\\" she writes.<br />When civilians could make a planned departure, they might take wagons full of furniture with them, assuming they had the means to transport such a massive amount of belongings.  Among the possessions that Massey describes being transported by refugees were pianos, kitchen stoves, livestock and pets, as well as other cherished furniture and household goods.<br />The chapters on deciding where to stay and what kind of accommodations and amenities might be available are fascinating.  Massey analyzes the benefits of refugeeing to a city versus the country or a small village.  She also describes the conflicts that arose when refugees stayed with extended family or had to deal with unhappy landlords.  In an era where state loyalty ran high, refugees often were reluctant to leave their home states, even if few safe havens remained there, she says.  As for the actual accommodations, Massey concludes that most refugees did not find what they were looking for, although different people tended to look for different things.  Due to food shortages, as the war progressed, a room rarely included board.  Cooking in one's room became common.<br />While refugees preferred a solid roof over their heads, even if that meant living in a carriage house, slave quarter or makeshift log cabin, Massey provides several examples of when refugees resided in tents, including tent cities around Petersburg, Atlanta and Fredericksburg.  Tents might be constructed of blankets, quilts, and rugs.<br />Given the patriotic fervor of supporting the troops and making do during the blockade, one might assume that society was understanding of refugees.  Not so, according to Massey.  Newcomers did not receive a warm welcome, even at church, where they were asked to sit in the balcony rather than in the pews occupied by regular parishioners.  Their children tended to be treated as outcasts at school.  Until late in the war, fundraising efforts focused on aiding soldiers, not refugees.  Massey concludes by describing the military policies of the North and South toward refugees, and efforts that ultimately were set up to provide aid.<br />The one drawback to \\"Refugee Life\\" is its organization.  The topics of chapters are not readily available from their titles, which are quotes pulled from period documents.  Fortunately, \\"Refugee Life\\" is well indexed, otherwise trying to find the section where daily life or treatment of border-state refugees was discussed would be quite time consuming.  Another slight weakness in the organization is a certain amount of repetition.  For instance, the chapter dealing with work opportunities goes over, albeit in greater detail, information already discussed in an earlier chapter on class distinctions.	2003-05-14

My reaction to this book was extremely mixed.  I ordered it by mistake, after confusing it with another book that had &quot;Everyday Life&quot; in the title.  The section about the involvement of the various states in the war was generally excellent--and provided a good reminder that the Civil War didn't affect only the eastern seaboard states that tend to get the most attention.  Details about country and city life, military organization and insignia, the war's timeline, shortages in the south, and events leading up to the war were extremely helpful.  This information is concise, well organized, and well illustrated.<br />What concerns me in books that are supposed to serve as a factual resource for others is when I find obvious errors.  The women's fashion section perpetuates Hollywood myths about Civil War-era fashions.  Mr. Varhola would have done well to consult Juanita Leitch's well-researched &quot;Who Wore What,&quot; considered the Bible for those involved in living history depicting the 1850s and 1860s.  Instead, he leaves the reader with the impression that most women dressed like Scarlett O'Hara.  The two pictures he selected to portray women's fashions are a ruffled ballgown, reminiscent of Scarlett's white dress in GWTW, and a Zoave jacket/Garibaldi shirt combination favored by less-authentic Civil War reenactors.  Experts on 1860s fashion consider the latter a high-fashion item that most average women would not have worn.  Terminology and descriptions about underpinnings also do not ring true.<br />I would give the overall book four stars, but the fashion section and some disappointing information about my home state two stars, thus my rating is an average.  Someone just learning about the period would find the book quite useful--as long as they ignored the fashion section.  Those more familiar with the period likely would regard it as a less useful rehash of information they have already read.	2003-05-05
US	50895531	RE5I5EGFDOPYG	1564407284	328822642	The Old Sturbridge Village Cookbook, 2nd: Authentic Early American Recipes for the Modern Kitchen	Books	5	24	24	N	N	Rosetta Stone for Historic Cookbooks	In the years that I've been collecting historic cookbooks and cookbooks adapting historic recipes, this is the best cookbook that I've ever run across.  Historic cookbooks tends to fall into one of three categories: 1) Reprints of originals with no modern measuring equivalents or other information that enables a modern cook to reproduce the recipes. 2) Adaptations of historic recipes with modern ingredients and techniques but no indication of what the original recipe involved. 3) Dutch-oven cookbooks that may recreate some historic recipes, but again with little or no information about the original recipe.  &quot;Old Sturbridge Village Cookbook&quot; is unusual in that it provides the text of 19th century cookbook author Lydia Child's original recipe, the modern adaptation, and the hearth-cooking technique.  By comparing the old with the new, a cook should be able to use this cookbook to adapt recipes from other historic cookbooks that do not provide a modern version.<br />The editor has selected recipes that can be created with easily available ingredients--and has omitted recipes for things that few modern Americans would ever want to eat--such as a calf's head that is build with the windpipe hanging out of the pot to drain off cooking juices.<br />In addition to recipes for soups, main dishes, vegetables, breads and desserts, the cookbook provides information about early 19th century meals.  One of the best features is a section on the various fire-building techniques that are necessary depending on the type of cooking--for instance, how to build a quick-cooking fire for frying versus a fire that will produce coals for slow-cooking techniques.<br />The recipes that I've tried so far turned out quite well.  Raspberry Shrub, a refreshing beverage made with a sweetened rasperry vinegar, was a hit with our children.  The Cider Cake, which I baked for my birthday, turned out more bread-like than cake-like, but was a hit with the party guests nonetheless.

I had always appreciated the instant gratification of rotary-cut strip-pieced quilts.  Kimball's \\"Red and Green: An Applique Tradition\\" has helped change that.<br />\\"R&G\\" focuses on red-and-green applique quilts from the mid-19th century, but also includes photographs of earlier whole-cloth and medallion, to show the progression of quilt-making styles, and several modern quilts that beautifully reproduce this traditional look.  Most fascinating to me was Kimball's discussion about how red and green became popular colors for these applique quilts:  Around 1850, aniline dye produced more colorfast cloth.  Green was produced by overdying yellow with blue.  The green fabrics almost always changed color, since the two dyes did not have the same degree of colorfastness, but quilt makers found the resulting colors pleasing.  At about the same time, \\"Turkey red\\"--using a dye that was much more colorfast than other reds--became fashionable--and commanded three times the price of ordinary calico.<br />A red and green applique quilts usually was a woman's \\"best quilt,\\" Kimball explains, and a woman generally made one of these labor-intensive quilts either just before her marriage as part of her trousseau or later in life, after her children were grown.<br />\\"R&G\\" contains many stories about the making and use of these applique quilts.  My favorite is about a circuit-riding preacher whose young wife defied tradition by joining her husband on all his overnight trips, instead of only on special occasions.  Her repeated presence presented problems in the southern communities he served since a visit from a preacher's wife dictated that the hostess must thoroughly clean the house, wear her second-best dress and a white apron, and use her best quilt on the guest bed.  If the preacher were staying over, food and bed were sufficient.  After a while, the frustrated women on the circuit decided to stop putting out their best appliqued quilts on the guest bed when the preacher's wife came to visit.  \\"She was pretty headstrong, that girl, but even she couldn't ignore what the absence of the best quilt signified,\\" Kimball quotes from an earlier work on quilts.<br />For quiltmakers interested in reproducing one of these traditional quilts, Kimball provides two dozen full-size patterns as well as ideas for other designs.  Her instructions for how to assemble these blocks seem very easy to follow.  What I liked best was that she doesn't just give instructions for one or two \\"cookie cutter\\" quilts, but instead emphasizes that quiltmakers should follow their own inspiration, using the design elements and ideas from the depicted quilts.  \\"R&G\\" contains plenty of inspiration, from the historic quilts and biographies of their makers in the front section, to the numerous rose, tulip, fruits and berry patterns in the middle, to the gallery of historic and reproduction quilts at the end.<br />Even if you aren't a fan of making applique quilts, \\"R&G\\" is interesting reading, and it might entice you to try a project.	2002-11-22

The core of the book, however, is the oral history behind the varied and absolutely gorgeous quilts depicted in the book.<br />We hear about Barbara Broyles of Tennessee who had the unusual experience of having soldiers \\"unkind enough\\" to return quilts that she sent for their use in a nearby camp.  (Usually quilts were not returned in these circumstances.)  Why unkind?  The quilts were infected with typhus from the diseases in camp and Broyles and her husband died four days later.  Her perhaps-fatal trapunto-style white whole cloth quilt is one of the most beautiful in the book.<br />Also depicted is an Irish chain and applique quilt given to a wounded Union soldier who was stranded behind lines.  The maker draped it over his shoulders to cover his blue uniform while he made his way back through Confederate-held territory.<br />My absolutely favorite story is the about Cave Hill Farm Quilt.  During the war, a sickly Confederate soldier, who had escaped from a group of prisoners, showed up at Kinkead family's door, asking to be hidden from the Yankees.  The mother directed him to a nearby cave, and gave him a feathered star quilt to keep warm.  The family wondered whether he made it safely to the cave--until sometime after the war when the quilt was discovered in the cave.  \\"Southern Quilts\\" illustrates this story not just with a \\"glamour shot\\" of the quilt but closeups of the damage done in the cave, and photographs of the Kinkead mother and daughters who created the quilt.<br />Among other quilts depicted are ones made to raise money for gunboats, quilts buried with the family silver, a quilt turned into a poncho for a soldier, quilts sent off to war, quilts similar to those covering the beds of generals on campaign, and commemoration quilts made after the war.<br />Especially interesting for me was a chance to see good close-up pictures of homespun and linsey-woolsey--fabrics to which southerners resorted due to the blockade.<br />Between the color photographs of quilts dating mostly from the 1840s to 1860s and interesting tales of individual experiences during the war, \\"Southern Quilts\\" is a book that I enjoy looking through again and again.	2002-11-21

For those interested in ideas of civilian living history activities, this book has some great ideas for women Civil War reenactors who want to do more than sit under the tent fly until their man returns from battle.  For those interested in making a quilt inspired by old-fashioned patterns, this book contains some beautiful projects and good instructions.  For those interested in faithfully recreating historically accurate quilts, this book is not for you.<br />After reading Barbara Brackman's wonderful &quot;Quilts from the Civil War,&quot; I anxiously awaited &quot;Civil War Women&quot;--expecting another book on recreating historic quilts.  Ultimately, I appreciated &quot;Civil War Women&quot; for what it was--a book containing interesting stories about the lives of women abolitionists, newspaper reporters, spies, plantation wives, nurses, government clerks, refugees and soldiers' wives.  In the book's nine chapters, Brackman focuses on describing the life of one women from each group, and then discusses others in these roles.  Numerous photographs and engravings help take the reader back to the 1860s.<br />I especially loved the suggested activities for reenactors: a quilting bee, giving a stump speech, collecting signatures for an album quilt, smuggling contraband, staging a bazaar, to name a few.  Brackman reprints a speech given by Amelia Bloomer and  excerpts diaries discussing quilting bees and fairs, which help to provide primary sources for these activities.  Even those not involved in living history might be inspired to try some of these activities for a different old-fashioned party.<br />For a book with a quilt on its cover that primarily has been marketed in quilt shops, however, the paucity of original quilts was disappointing.  Of the 30-some quilts depicted in &quot;Civil War Women,&quot; only a quarter are originals.  And although Brackman describes the project quilts as being inspired by originals, in many cases, she does not depict the originals so that the quilter interested in authenticity can determine where accuracy left off and inspiration took over.  Unlike the reproduction quilts in &quot;Quilts of the Civil War,&quot; which many times appeared very similar to the originals, these quilts just don't quite look like other historic quilts that I have seen from the period.<br />Had this book not clearly targeted reenactors, I would not complain about the quilts.  But for those involved in living history for the sake of public education rather than because they like &quot;theme camping,&quot; authenticity is important, and the suggestion that reenactors can create good reproduction quilts by relying merely on this book does a disservice.	2002-11-20
US	50895531	R27EJRR5Y07H2K	0679781048	97992955	Mothers of Invention: Women of the Slaveholding South in the American Civil War	Books	5	31	32	N	N	Excellent overview of elite women's Civil War experience	In \\"Mothers of Invention,\\" Drew Gilpin Faust explores the ways in which the Civil War transformed traditional gender roles among middle- and upper-class southern women.  Gilpin theorizes that Confederate women certainly were aware of the effect that government policies had on their lives-even if the leaders, at times, were not-and that women's views conscription, home defense, economic production and slavery influenced and, ultimately, undermined their support for the war.<br />Her key point seems to be that the war overturned the \\"social contract\\" in which elite women accepted subordination and dependence for male protection and privilege.  Although men were off protecting their homes in the abstract sense, women were left to deal with the day-to-day realities of food shortages and an invading army occupying their homes.<br />Narrowing exceptions to the draft, the military's refusals to grant furloughs in times of great family need, and government policies regarding food requisitions especially galled women.  Faust puts a particularly interesting gender perspective on the draft exemption for those owning 20+ slaves.  Normally, this exemption is viewed solely in class terms: \\"Rich man's war, poor man's fight.\\"  Faust, however, brings attention to the fear that white women experienced being left alone to manage large slave populations without a man's help.  Women feared murder and uprisings from a slave population that was growing increasingly rebellious.  The priority ultimately given to equitably treating draft-age white men and the burden of managing slaves led to a decline in women's support for the slave system and for the Confederacy, she argues.<br />In addition to slave management, Faust explores other ways in which the war caused elite white women to step into traditional male roles.  From the very beginning, secession and the war led to much greater involvement by women in the public sphere.  Although politics had been considered the province of men, secession was a topic that no one could stop discussing-women included.  The banding together of women to support the war effort also proved a new experience for southern women.  Unlike their northern sisters, southern women typically had not been involved in social organizations before the war.<br />Faust's book includes a fascinating discussion about attitudes toward the refugee experience.  In particular, she notes that becoming a refugee was the civilian equivalent of buying a substitute for the draft.  A refugee, the term implied, had the money and connections to make a planned departure from home-often to protect property.  In support of this view, she cites the diary of Mary Lee of Winchester, who disdained the term refugee in favor of \\"displaced person\\" to describe those fleeing with little in the face of the enemy.<br />\\"Mothers of Invention\\" contains one of the most interesting analyses of the hoop skirt that I have seen.  Faust notes that the trend for full skirts, ultimately supported by hoops, coincided with the Victorian ideals of domesticity and women's separate sphere.  The caged crinoline or hoop offered women a portable enclosed private space and the wide skirts symbolized a circle in which women were protected.  In an era where upper-class women's sexuality was repressed, the style also hid and reformed female anatomy.  The conspicuous consumption of fabric and the difficulty performing physical labor in these skirts made a class statement as well.<br />\\"Mothers of Invention\\" provides a good overview of the different ways that the war affected southern women's lives, including changes within the household, relations between husbands and wives, paid employment outside the home, the likelihood that young women would remain single due to the deaths of so many young men, religious views on the war, increased educational opportunities for women, dealing with Yankee men, etc.  Her accessible writing style and use of interesting quotes and numerous pictures make this a relatively quick read.  The book is well-organized with subheadings that make locating important points quite easy.<br />For those interested in exploring the southern woman's war experience, this book would be a good starting point for gaining some good general knowledge.  Readers should keep in mind, however, that Faust is focusing on elite and middle-class women, and that the experiences and attitudes she describes do not reflect the lives of lower-class women.	2002-11-20
US	50895531	R2NLDT6VIIDWTG	1571200339	336962707	Quilts from the Civil War: Nine Projects, Historic Notes, Diary Entries	Books	5	68	71	N	N	More than just a quilt book	\\"Quilts from the Civil War\\" not only contains project for reproducing numerous quilts of the 1850s and 1860s, it also contains an excellent discussion of the role quilts played in people's lives.  Barbara Brackman describes quilts made for freedom fairs, by the Sanitary Commission for use by soldiers, and quilts made to express patriotic fervor.  Brackman goes beyond a mere discussion of quilts, however, to discuss the development of chemical dyes, women's involvement in the war effort in general, the effect of the blockade on southern textile production, the need to hide quilts from occupying Yankee forces, and even the relationships that developed between quiltmakers and soldiers who received the donated quilt.<br />Brackman also examines the argument that quilts were used as clues for slaves escaping on the Underground Railroad, and concludes that these tales likely were a myth.  (Nevertheless, she includes a Jacob's Ladder-style quilt that honors the Underground Railroad.)  In evaluating this theory, she discusses the history of the Log Cabin quilt.<br />Period photographs of women and children, engravings of Sanitary Fairs and other gatherings, photographs of original and reproduction quilts and original dresses beautifully illustrate this book.  Excerpts from journals, letters and newspaper articles and reprints of ads calling for the production of items for soldiers add further interest.<br />Brackman provides a unique timeline that combines both traditional historic events, such as \\"March 4, 1864 - Grant becomes Commander-in-Chief of the Union Army\\" with social or women's history, such as \\"August 1864 - Ladies Christian Commission of San Francisco sponsors a Grand Fair\\" and \\"October 5, 1864 - Mary Jones of Georgia records paying $16 a yard for calico.\\"<br />Footnotes provide directions for those interested in further research.<br />One drawback is that the projects contained in the book do not faithfully reproduce the historic quilts.  Some are fairly easy to adapt to make more authentic, such as the Underground Railroad quilt, which adds 8-pointed stars to a Four Patch in a Strip pattern.  Since the book contains a picture of the original, a quiltmaker can easily see that by leaving off the stars, she can make a quilt that's closer to the original.  Other patterns will take a little more ingenuity to adapt, but again, pictures of the originals should help.<br />Those mostly interested in southern quilts would probably do better with \\"Southern Quils: Surviving Relics of the Civil War.\\"  Brackman concludes that few quilts were produced in the Confederacy due to blockade-caused shortages of fabric, needles, thread and other necessities.<br />For those interested in trying some of the projects contained in the book, the directions are clear and easy to follow.  Brackman provides strip quilting directions for some of the quilts (such as the Underground Railroad) but not for others where this technique could speed production (such as the Log Fence).  The appendix contains excellent information on batting, quilting styles, binding and other details to give quilts a more period look.<br />Overall, despite projects that are more inspired by historic quilts than faithful reproductions, \\"Quilts from the Civil War\\" is an excellent source of information about textile production during the 1850s and 1860s.	2002-11-20

Start at the beginning with the tale of Claire Randall, a former WWII nurse, who travels through a circle of standing stones and winds up in Scotland in the 1740s, where she falls in love with highlander Jamie Fraser, and continue on with the stories about Brianna, their daughter born after Claire returns to her own time.  That's one of the best romance novels I've read.<br />If \\"The Fiery Cross\\" had been the first of the \\"Outlander\\" books that I had read, I would never have finished it nor read any others in the series.  But if you have traveled this far through the series, plough through the first 250 or so pages, because the last part of the book is worth it.  Ultimately, you will get treated to stories of murder and mystery and intrigue.<br />\\"The Fiery Cross\\" begins in 1770 in North Carolina with a gathering of clans --Scots who have immigrated to the colonies following the Battle of Culloden.  Unfortunately, the events at this gathering get rather tediousness as Gabaldon attempts to catch up any new readers on what has happened in the previous four novels and introduce new characters who will become key to her plot.  With all the side plots and vignettes of Claire in her makeshift surgery and Roger enthralling the clans with his folk songs and Jamie being manly and lord like and Brianna worrying about future pregnancies, it's hard to tell where Gabaldon is going with this book.<br />Once Roger and Brianna marry and the family returns to their homestead, the story improves.  One key theme Gabaldon develops is what happens to the Fraser-MacKenzie family on the eve of the American Revolution.  The governor has asked Jamie to raise a militia to deal with the Regulators--a group of protesting colonists who have rioted against the Crown.  Claire joins Roger and Jamie as they head off, hoping to avoid a violent conflict.  The scenes in the militia camp are reminiscent of the tales of the Rising in \\"Dragonfly in Amber.\\"<br />The other plot line that runs through the book is Jamie's quest for vengeance against Stephen Bonnet, the pirate who raped Brianna in \\"Drums of Autumn,\\" and possibly fathered her son.  Throughout \\"Cross,\\" Jamie receives information about how to find Bonnet, ensuring that a showdown will come by the end of the novel.<br />Gabaldon also introduces a new villain, who I have no doubt we will continue to encounter.  While I don't want to spoil any surprises, I will just mention that this villain poses some of the same dilemmas as Jack Randall did--and makes \\"Cross\\" worth continuing, even when you are thinking that the clan gathering will never end.<br />One of the best parts of \\"Cross\\" is a murder mystery that begins at the wedding of Jamie's aunt, Jocasta Cameron, and that later weaves in part of Jocasta's history in Scotland, and elements of a plot that started in \\"Dragonfly in Amber.\\"  Gabaldon has said that she originally wrote \\"Outlander\\" has practice for her first \\"real\\" novel, which was going to be a mystery.  The intrigue that she adds to \\"Cross\\" makes it worth reading.<br />\\"Cross\\" definitely left me looking forward to the next in the series.  No doubt the outbreak of the American Revolution will add more drama to the lives of Jamie, his time-traveling family, Claire, Roger and Brianna.	2002-11-08

Each chapter is illustrated with line drawings and planting diagrams.  Themes include a fairy garden, a rose garden, a water garden, ornamental grasses, a lakeside garden (yes, in a container), herbs, Mediterranean vegetables, Japanese.  For each theme, the authors provide instructions on making or selecting an appopriate container and a long list of plants that you might include, complete with zone information, Latin names, and basic plant descriptions.  If you want a book with lots of pretty photographs, this isn't the gardening book for you, but if you want ideas on a scale that is \\"do-able,\\" this is ideal.  The container approach can be adapted to a larger-scale theme garden for those blessed with more space.	2002-09-06

I absolutely hated &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; when I tried to read it in high school.  While I absolutely loved romances and novels set in the 19th century, when I attempted &quot;P&amp;P,&quot; I got as far as the scene where Elizabeth strolls around the room with one of Mr. Bingley's sisters and thought that all this walking up and down was the stupidest thing anyone could do and quit reading it.<br />I didn't start appreciating Jane Austen until I read &quot;Persuasion&quot; for a graduate history class that explored how the concept of womanhood changed between the late 18th century and the beginning of Queen Victoria's reign.  Our goal was to examine whether the new Victorian ideal of womanhood was something women themselves embraced or a role thrust upon them.  And at last, I began to appreciate Jane Austen.<br />By the time I got around to rereading &quot;P&amp;P,&quot; Emma Thomson's delightful adaptation of &quot;Sense and Sensability&quot; had made it to theaters, and I was old enough to appreciate that love at first site can be a disaster.<br />Jane Austen may have been the first novelist to write about love from a woman's point of view--and wrote at a time when marriages were becoming more about love and not just financial considerations.  Throughout many of her novels, Austen struggles with whether money should matter in matters of the heart.  She seems to want to say that money shouldn't matter, and yet recognizes that when a young woman's entire future depended on her husband's financial status, money still had to matter.<br />&quot;P&amp;P&quot; begins with the wealthy Mr. Bingley renting a house near the home of the Bennetts, a family with five daughters, no sons and an entailed estate that would have to pass to the nearest male relative.  Much to her daughter Elizabeth's frustration, Mrs. Bennett immediately begins plotting ways to snag Mr. Bingley for one of her daughters.  At a party, Elizabeth first encounters Mr. Darcy.  Overhearing his criticism of her immediately gets them off on the wrong foot.  As the novel unfolds, Darcy and Elizabeth discover each other's true nature, and eventually misunderstandings are repaired, and they develop an appreciation of each other.  The pacing of &quot;P&amp;P&quot; more realistically reflects the growth of true love than many novels that I've read.  Austen's witty commentary about courting rituals makes the book highly entertaining.<br />To enrich the experience of reading &quot;Pride and Prejudice,&quot; pick up a copy of Fay Weldon's &quot;Letters to Alice Upon Her First Reading of Jane Austen.&quot;  Weldon's collections of essays to her fictitious niece enrich the experience of reading Jane Austen's novels by exploring what makes certain works absolute classics, what life was like for women in the early 19th century, and what Austen's life was like as she was writing these novels.	2002-08-23

Since my first was the essentially nonviolent Motherpeace deck, this was quite a change.  I was attracted to the deck after a friend did a reading for me using her Barbara Walker deck.  The Arthurian imagery of the Cups is beautiful.  Other imagery, particularly on the &quot;negative&quot; cards, tends to be more disturbing.  I have had extremely intense and dead-on readings with this deck.  Since I use tarot as a tool for self-reflection, the harshness of some images can be helpful to avoid trying to put a sunny spin on the reading.  Other times, however, this can be a very hard deck to bring out and use.<br />I did not find the enclosed booklet terribly helpful for interpretation, although it does a good job explaining the inspiration for the images.<br />I agree with the reviewers who said this is not a beginner's deck.  If you are looking for a good feminist/goddess-oriented tarot deck, I would suggest Motherpeace or Daughters of the Moon.  After you are comfortable using the tarot, then consider Barbara Walker's deck.	2002-08-22

Think again!  Feel frustrated and angry at the people around you who, no matter how much you plead, won't change and start behaving the way you want?  Here's a solution.<br />Dr. Harriet Lerner's &quot;The Dance of Anger&quot; provides a whole new approach for women who feel stuck and powerless.  Using case studies, Lerner demonstrates ways that women can change their reactions when other people's behavior and expectations upsets them.  Her basic premise:  You can't change how others treat you--you can only change how you respond.  Throughout the book, Lerner provides examples of how women can set boundaries with friends, family members and others so that they can break out of unsatisfying relationship patterns.<br />The &quot;Thinking in Threes&quot; chapter addresses ways that third parties get pulled into conflicts, and how to better handle these situations by focusing on the source of the conflict.<br />Lerner's book is an excellent source for learning a &quot;new dance&quot;--a new way of approaching life.  One caveat:  I question whether this approach would be safe or appropriate for someone dealing with domestic violence or an emotionally abusive relationship.  While several experts in that area have said that the reason people abuse is because it works, making the abuse no longer work by using Lerner's approach of changing one's reaction to that behavior could make the abuse escalate.  From the training I've received in domestic violence (I'm not a therapist but I do have some professional training in this area), I believe that the most dangerous time for someone in an abusive relationship occurs when she tries to get out of that relationship.  Changing one's response to abusive behavior under Lerner's recommendations might make the situation more dangerous.	2002-08-15

The book isn't really a quilt pattern book--although it has instructions for how to make several quilts seen in the film.  And it isn't really a &quot;making of&quot; or movie trivia book--although it contains those elements as well.<br />Author and quilter Patty McCormick provides an interesting Hollywood outsider's perspective on the making of one of my favorite movies.  McCormick is so NOT a movie person that when she gets a phone call to provide technical quilt assistance for &quot;How to Make an American Quilt,&quot; she doesn't recognize the name of Steven Spielberg's production company.  Her tales of how the movie's quilts were designed and created are quite fun to read.<br />Although the quilts were an integral part of the film, several specially created quilts appear on screen so briefly that getting the opportunity to study photos of them is a treat.  Learning what happened to a few--such as the well-loved crazy-patch quilt that young Finn clutches while sitting underneath the quilting frame--was a bit like hearing fingernails grate down a chalkboard.<br />McCormick provides patterns for both the &quot;Where Love Resides&quot; Baltimore album quilt that the quilting circle works on throughout the film, and Anna's baby quilt featuring African animals.  I didn't buy it ever planning to make either quilt, but those monkeys, lions and giraffes are rather growing on me.  Perhaps someday.	2002-08-09

The first half of the book mostly involves the mishaps on their journey north, life at the aunt's plantation, Jamie's debate over whether to strike out on his own or accept his aunt's generous offer, an adventure-filled trip to the wilderness, and ultimately, getting settled in a home in the new world.<br />While I don't want to suggest that all these events are mundane--this is Jamie and Claire Fraser we're talking about, after all--the events are very episodic.  Gabaldon lacks any kind of overriding theme to organize the plot.  In \\"Outlander,\\" we had Claire's ultimate decision about whether to return to her 20th century life.  In \\"Dragonfly in Amber,\\" we had their attempt to prevent Culloden.  In \\"Voyager,\\" we first had Claire's search for records of what happened to Jamie, and later the search and rescue of Jamie's nephew Ian.<br />Also missing in \\"Drums\\" is a good villain.  With the deaths of Jack Randall and Geillis Duncan, Gabaldon has to create a new bad guy or two.  She does introduce her villains fairly early on--only their true malevolence does not become apparent until much later.  In other words, unlike the way the threat of Jack Randall loomed in \\"Outlander,\\" the threat of these villains seems to disappear when they initially disappear from the plot.<br />About halfway through \\"Drums,\\" the Frasers' daughter, Brianna, who remains in the 20th century, discovers something about her parents' fate and decides to travel to the past to warn them.  Her boyfriend, Roger Wakefield, follows her.  Once Brianna and Roger wind up in the past, the plot tends to liven up, and the direction of the book also begins to make sense.  Without revealing certain plot twists, I will note that certain events should create a sense of urgency to get certain issues resolved--and yet Gabaldon does not really leave the reader that worried about the potential outcomes.  Gabaldon does manage a few nice little plot twists at the end, so keep going.  Suffice to say that Roger has an interesting encounter with an ancestor, and Frank's influence comes into play.<br />Despite my tepid praise for this book, as historical romances go, it's still quite good--just not as good as the first three.  One aspect that I appreciate about Gabaldon's books is that she does not overly romanticize the hardships and harsh living conditions of the past.  She also deftly avoids overly sentimentalizing certain situations or going for the cliche.  For instance, when Brianna meets her real father, at long last, after traveling through time and across the ocean, she first seems him behind a pub, urinating--not in some idealized encounter.<br />I'm crossing my fingers that \\"The Fiery Cross\\" is better, but I'm not optimistic.	2002-06-20

That's about the best thing I can say about this ill-conceived sequel.  As a longtime \\"Windy,\\" I eagerly looked forward to the publication of \\"Scarlett\\" when I heard that one was coming out.  What a disappointment!<br />Taking Scarlett's \\"tomorrow is another day\\" approach to life as her starting point, \\"Scarlett\\" sends the GWTW heroine back to Tara, where this time she discovers that her beloved Mammy has died.  What a plot twist!  Where could Ripley have found the inspiration?  Could it be, dare I say, Scarlett's desparate return to Tara after the burning of Atlanta when she only wants her mother, only to discover that her mother has just died?  By the way, if you're counting from the point just before \\"Gone with the Wind\\" left off, at this point, Mammy's death comes on the heals of the deaths of daughter Bonnie and Melanie Wilkes.  Being connected with Scarlett must be hazardous to one's health.  Mammy's death actually serves a more pragmatic purpose.  Written in the PC '90s, \\"Scarlett\\"'s solution to Mitchell's unPC treatment of African-American characters was to kill them off quickly, and later to move Scarlett far away from the South.  Unfortunately, with Mammy gone, we have no one to serve as Scarlett's conscience.  She was always the rather large Jimminy Cricket reminding Scarlett of what she should do--just before she did the opposite.<br />Discovering that Tara just ain't what it used to be, Scarlett then sets off to Charleston in the hope of winning Rhett back.  The scenes in which we meet Rhett's mother, Scarlett attempts at reconciliation, and the post-shipwreck love scene are the only interesting ones in the book.  And fortunately they come early--making them easier to find.  A wise reader would stop here.  These scenes are the ONLY reason for giving this review more than one star.<br />Alas, we're not even halfway through the darn thing at this point.  Scarlett then visits her O'Hara relatives and gets in touch with her Irish roots.  Ultimately, she winds up in Ireland in the midst of the Irish-English conflict of the 1870s.  Scarlett acquires the original Tara, and sets out to be a beneficent landowner to her tenants.  Since those working her land are white, we are expected to find this arrangement palatable, while addressing the plight of freed slaves in the South could not be done in the same \\"nostalgia for the Old South\\" style of the original book.<br />Just in case you actually intend to read the whole novel, I won't reveal whether Scarlett and Rhett get back together.  If you are dying to know the answer, I would suggest that you just read that final chapter at the bookstore and save your money.<br />There are so many wonderful journals about life during Reconstruction and during the Civil War.  If \\"Gone with the Wind\\" has left you longing for more, read one of those.	2002-06-15

I failed miserably at the quizzes.  In other words, even if you're a Windy, you probably will learn something from this book.<br />One of the best sections addresses what the GWTW actors did with their careers, including the minor characters.  One of the Tarleton twins, for instance, went on to play Superman.<br />Information on the costuming gave me a new respect for the efforts at authenticy.  Unfortunately, this book leaves the reader with the impression that GWTW costumes are historically accurate.  As someone who has researched 1860s clothing for living history, that's an unfortunate misconception.  Other sources (not this book) explain that Technicolor considerations trumped accuracy.<br />Nonetheless, I learned lots of new tidbits about the movie and the book, making it well worth the price.	2002-06-15

Ultimately, I found that I couldn't put it down.<br />The heroine, Gustine, works as a \\"dress lodger\\"--a prostitute hired to wear an expensive dress that, theoretically, will attract a higher-paying clientele.  Gustine is shadowed by the Eye, a disfigured old woman whose job is to ensure the return of the dress at the end of the night.  One night, Gustine encounters Dr. Henry Chiver, a physician struggling to establish a medical school.  In an age when donating one's body to science was not done, finding cadavers often turns students of anatomy into grave robbers.  Gustine aids Henry in finding bodies, in hopes that he eventually will be able to help her with a need of her own.  In the end, Gustine teaches Henry the value of reverencing all life.	2002-06-07

Since \\"Motherpeace\\" was my first tarot set and I have spent little time using more traditional decks, I may not be able to accurately describe what images have changed.  Instead of the traditional royalty hierarchy--King, Queen, etc., Motherpeace portrays them as Priest and Priestess.  Although the desk retains the more-common medieval theme for the Cups suit, images from other cultures appear on the other suits: African (Wands), Navajo (Discs), and Greco-Roman (Swords).<br />After using these cards in readings for more than 10 years, the images have become part of how I view certain situations.  For instance, the Eight of Discs, featuring a very pregnant woman sitting in a patch of watermelons, is how I now visualize the experience of waiting, sometimes impatiently, for something to come to fruition.  Depicting \\"Strength\\" as the Irish Goddess Brigid sitting among animals has caused me to rethink what true strength means--groundedness--not brute force.  The images are so intricately drawn that a regular reader always will discover new details and new perspectives.<br />When I started reading tarot cards, I wasn't looking for something to predict the future.  I approached the cards as an opportunity to use guided imagery to reflect on my life and my future.  Over the years, however, I have experienced some extremely odd coincidences, and now associate certain cards with certain events.<br />The companion book provides an excellent discussion about the inspiration for the images, and for the most part, a good sense of the meaning behind the images.  Eventually, once one has used the cards for a while, the images can drive the reading, without constant referral to the guidebook.  One drawback of the companion book is that it doesn't provide a variety of readings.  For that, I wouldsuggest \\"Tarot for Yourself.\\"	2002-06-06

Ethan finds himself paying attention to his appearance and wanting Mattie to admire him.  The forbidden attraction grows when Ethan's nag of a wife, Zeena, leaves home for a brief period.  Wharton makes Ethan and Mattie's plight achingly optionless, and her observations of human behavior are, as usual, dead on.  Although Wharton is best known for her novels about New York high society, &quot;Ethan Frome&quot; remains not just my favorite Wharton novel--but also one of my favorite &quot;classics.&quot;	2002-05-29

Some of the funniest moments in the book (yes, despite the subject, it does evoke a smile now and then) are the efforts that Kennedy aides made to get a reluctant Senator Yarborough to ride with LBJ in the motorcades.  The many seemingly inconsequential decisions that ultimately led to the slow-moving motorcade through Dealey Plaza make the reader want to cry out, \\"No!  Put the bubble top! Speak at a different site!\\"  As the book nears the fateful hour, the reader is left with a sense that there's still a chance to avoid this tragedy.<br />The hours and days immediately after the assassination are equally fascinating.  Jackie's wait at Parkland Hospital and her trip home on Air Force One are told with heart-breaking detail.  (Lest this aspect seem overly invasive, the reader should note that the book was written with her blessing and cooperation.)  The story of how the memorable funeral and Arlington burial came about are fascinating.  The tensions between the Kennedy and Johnson aides provide a good lesson in how NOT to act after a tragedy.<br />If you're only interested in the conspiracy theories, however, this is not the book for you.  Manchester wholeheartedly backs the lone gunman hypothesis, and his descriptions of Oswald's movements at this time are hard to swallow in light of the details that have emerged in the decades since the assassination.  Since most of the book focuses on the Kennedy family, the Kennedy and Johnson aides, and other political figures, however, this one drawback does not significantly detract from the book.	2002-05-28

I discovered Estes' book after Jean Shinoda Bolen's &quot;Goddesses in Every Woman&quot; turned me onto Jungian archetypes.  Unlike the Greek myths in &quot;Goddesses,&quot; however, the stories Estes chooses to portray the lessons women need to learn to grown are much darker.  Perhaps because Estes' writing requires so much emotional work from the reader, I took a very long time reading this.  I would pick it up, read a chapter, put it down for sometimes a month or more, and then pick it up again.  As I went through this process, I made an astonishing discovery:  Somehow, what followed from the point where I had left off was EXACTLY what I needed when I picked up the book again.

A serial killer is on the loose, gruesomely preying upon cross-dressing boy prostitutes.  Police detectives are making no progress solving the ghastly crimes.  In fact, someone with power or influence seems to be bent on silencing witnesses and thwarting any investigation.  Reform-minded police commissioner Theodore Roosevelt (yes, the same TR who later became president), determined to catch the killer, assembles an unconventional group of investigators headed by \\"alienist\\" Dr. Lazlo Kreizler.  (In the 19th century, when psychology was in its infancy, the mentally ill were considered \\"alienated\\" from themselves and society, and the experts who treated them were known as \\"alienists.\\")  <br />Dr. Kreizler teams with his former Harvard classmate, New York Times crime reporter John Moore, Moore's longtime friend, heiress-turned-NYPD-secretary Sara Howard, and two former patients who now work as his servants.  To help identify the killer, who leaves behind very few clues, manages to spirit his victims out of locked rooms, and passes through the city unnoticed, the team attempts to develop a psychological profile of the type of person who would be capable of such horrendous deeds.<br />Author Caleb Carr puts his historical background to fascinating use.  \\"The Alienist\\" is filled with rich details about both the seamier underside and more privileged parts of late-19th-century New York City and the then-novel crime detection techniques.  Detectives Lucius and Marcus Isaacson, assigned to assist the investigation, employ the not-yet-accepted science of fingerprinting and other methods of identification in their hunt for the killer.  <br />\\"The Alienist\\" is one of the few murder mysteries that I have ever enjoyed reading a second time.  The characters are memorable, dryly amusing at times, and always fascinating.  Carr portrays his victims as humans and individuals, rather than sensationalizing their professions.  The plot, including a race against timeonce the team starts predicting when the killer is likely to strike again, moves along at a brisk pace.  The historical detail advances the plot rather than bogging it down.    <br />Lovers of historical novels, murder mysteries and detective stories will have a hard-time putting down this addictive combination of the three genres.	2002-05-08

Not so with \\"Gone to Soldiers.\\"  The characters that she creates in this story of the home fronts of World War II seem so real.  A French resistance fighter, a spy, a code breaker, a factory worker, an aviator, a Jewish-American soldier...  All have such interesting lives.  The story--or should I say, stories?--are told from the perspectives of these various characters in a center-of-consciousness style.

Perhaps what I loved best was the portrayal of middle-aged passion as Claire and Jamie are reunited again. What a rare romance novel to feature a heroine in her late 40s(?) or early 50s(?). Obviously I need the \\"Outlandish Companion\\" since I can't remember these little details.<br />I was surprised to see that other readers thought this was a little slow paced, took too long to get started, and that the years apart were \\"too sad.\\" Although I was anxious for Claire and Jamie to reunite, I felt that the bittersweet years apart heightened the joy of their return, and the sense that Claire and Jamie truly are the greatest loves of each other's lives. I enjoyed the opportunity to get to know Jamie more, and see things through his eyes for a change, instead of mostly getting Claire's perspective.<br />The chapters focusing on how Claire's disappearance and return affected her marriage to Frank satisfied questions that remained unsettled after \\"Dragonfly in Amber.\\" I had found Frank's apparent acceptance of Claire back into his life in \\"Dragonfly\\" somewhat unbelievable. (Yes, for some reason, despite a book premised on the ability to time travel, I still expect believability in the other aspects.) Frank's attitude in \\"Voyager\\" seemed much more what I would have expected.<br />I'm notorious for reading ahead, especially if the plot is dragging, but I was rarely tempted in \\"Voyager.\\" I couldn't put the darn book down. I felt that the plot moved along much faster than \\"Dragonfly.\\"<br />Some of the coincidences at the end became a little much for me, hence my decision to give only four stars. I don't want to give away the plot, but I did feel that the likelihood of Claire, Jamie and Fergus & Co. all ending up in the same spot following \\"challenges\\" at sea a little unlikely. If I could write like Mark Twain, I would skewer those scenes as savagely as he did James Fenimore Cooper's unbelievable twists. Since I can't, I'll just note that it's hard enough sometimes for me to findmy fiance when we get separated in the supermarket, and yet, in all the Carribean, they manage to reconnect pretty quickly. (Just read through it, roll your eyes, and move on.)<br />On the other hand, the connection that Claire discovers between a friend in her time with someone whom she meets in the past didn't bother me, the more I thought about it. For me, that just seemed part of the \\"pull\\" that connects her to the two time periods. At the end of \\"Voyager,\\" I was left with a sense that her time traveling could be connected with some deeper type of mystery.<br />If I weren't so broke, I'd be ordering \\"Drums of Autumn\\" this second rather than writing this review.	2002-04-08

A common dilemma when reading journals is the lack of context regarding their historical times.  Too often, context is provided  in an introduction or brief footnotes.  On the other side, I am often  disappointed by biographies that provide very little of the primary source  and instead rely heavily on the author's synthesizing.  Ulrich's essays on  Martha Ballard's journals provide a wonderful combination of these two  forms.  With such terse journal entries, a casual reader would miss so  much, were it not for Ulrich's delving into Martha's world and enriching  the context.  I also would highly recommend the PBS video about Ulrich's  project.	2000-04-26
