It seems like a contradiction, 'tell your boss no and get ahead in life', but that's the advice Kemp offers.  Kemp is really saying 'be honest' and 'look past your nose and see the implications of your choices'.  The fastest and most elegant way to do so often involves being a master of `NO!'<br /><br />The book is full of exercises, which inventory your moods and habits.  There are three personality types: 'Masters of NO', 'Wafflers' (putting off a NO) and 'yes-ters' (at best an 'always helpful' type). By reading the book, you can be a Master of NO!<br /><br />More could have been done to review the motivations of the always-helpful types.  Additionally, several genetically based instincts encourage many to be 'helpful' as a matter of course.  These 'helpful' instincts provide con-men with a good living.

The aim of the symposium was to discuss the status of so called 'mirror neurons' and their potential consequences on our understanding of the brain evolution, social intelligence, behavioral role identification and theory of mind.<br /><br />It is hard to overestimate the importance of this discovery. First of all, it provides a new model of cognition which is based on neuro-biology rather than intellectual speculation on our private sense of 'existence'. Currently, it is widely believed that such specifically human activities as language and the use of tools depend on wide scale developments and re-organization of neural functioning.  These hypothesized neural features involve cascading networks of neural circuits with the highest level of unification, effectively engaging 'the brain as a whole.'  It is important to note the 'source' of cognition according to this model.  Cognition is the final outcome of analysis initiated by reception of sensory data.  By accumulating many small decisions, the 'whole' emerges.  This cognitive entity (a thought, perhaps) ends up producing responses (actions).  Action is thus the end product of analysis.  In terms of pop psychology, network enough computers and cognition will eventually emerge.<br /><br />The discovery of mirror neurons by Rizzolatti and Arbib provide a strong argument against the 'cognition requires the whole brain' theory.  The properties of mirror neurons seem to suggest instead that the so-called 'motor functions' of the nervous system are more complex than we have expected.  Instead of building the brain from a single neural cell type, there seem to be at least 3 nerve types:<br />1) Motor neuron which stimulate muscle contraction,<br />2) Communication neurons which link motor neurons to the brain<br />3) Mirror neurons which, for lack of a better term, make decisions.<br /><br />Yes, mirror neurons demonstrate single cell decision making abilities. Not only do mirror neurons, on an individual level, demonstrate an ability to control and execute action, they also demonstrate the ability to maintain an internal representation and compare that representation to sensory input. This is the antithesis of the 'whole brain' theory. It posits cognition exists at the cellular level. In this view, action-control and action-representation are both capacities of individual mirror neuron. Cognition precedes sensation. It exists of and for itself. Cognition seeks sensation rather then being the product of sensation.<br /><br />Think about it.<br /><br />I apologize for going into such broad speculations and ignoring specifics on the book in question.  Be assured the above is my attempt to summarize important concepts raised by various articles.<br /><br />The book is organized into 4 sections.  Of the 4, only the first specifically addresses 'mirror neuron' research.  The four sections are:<br />1) Current mirror neuron research.<br />2) Neurology papers that shed light on areas of interest to mirror neuron research.<br />3) Evolution papers that seek to use insights gained by mirror-neuron research<br />4) Computational models based on mirror-neuron models<br /><br />The articles are uneven in quality.  Keep in mind the timing of the conference.  The year was 2000, prior to the 2004 reports that mirror neuron disfunction was implicated in autism.  Some of the articles (Birten) understand the paradigm shift  and anticipate the link, others miss the point.neurons demonstrate single cell decision making abilities.

For example, how is  'emotion' differentiated from 'feeling'?  Are emotion and logic independent? This book should help you explore these questions.<br /><br />Ekman starts with arguments for the universality of emotional display.  All humans produce the same facial displays when engaged in a moment of anger or sadness.  Reactive displays are generally 'honest' but fleeting.  All socially adept humans have learned to disguise their emotional displays.  Sometimes a high-speed camera is required to capture and 'freeze' the initial 'true' display.  Given the difficulty of 'real time' determination of an emotional display's meaning, Ekman standardizes his approach on a suitably literal plane.  For example, the raise eyebrow means 'X' in 'Y' percent of the population, but only 'Z' percent recognize it.<br /><br />Here is an outline of characteristics Ekman uses to define emotions:<br /><br />1. Emotions are experienced as feelings, a set of sensations that we experience and often are aware of.<br /><br />2. An emotional episode can be brief (less than a second to several seconds). If it is longer, it is a mood<br /><br />3. It is about something that matters to the person<br /><br />4. We experience them as happening to us, they are not chosen.<br /><br />5. We are constantly scanning our environment. Emotional responses are automatic reactions to these perceptions. In this sense, emotions are an 'early warning system'.<br /><br />6. Refractory periods exist after the emotional response.  During this refractory period, only perceptions that supports the emotional response is considered.<br /><br />7. The refractory period may last a few minutes or much longer<br /><br />8. We generally become aware of an emotion only after our attention begins to review it in the past tense.<br /><br />9. There are universal emotional themes. We become emotional about matters that were relevant to our ancestors as well as ones we have found to matter in our own lives.<br /><br />10. The desire to experience or not experience an emotion motivates much of behavior.<br /><br />11. An efficient signal, clear, rapid and universal, informs those that witness the display.  The knowledge gained makes social cooperation possible.<br /><br />All of this background information takes up the first 4 chapters.  Many readers will find this an unnecessary delay.  Much of this material seems to wander about in politically correct debates about 'why we can't all be nice', or 'can education ban anger?'.<br /><br />Many will find this clueless and banal, but there is a lot of useful material mixed in.  Take the time to suffer through it.<br /><br />The curious hand ringing over the 'value' of anger is a testimony to stifling academic conformity on US colleges.  Ekman is arguing there is a genetic componet to emotional IQ.  The thesis is politically incorrect and sure to ruin a promising academic career. I decided the author had to demonstrate his touchy-feely sensitivity so the academic 'children are blank slates' mob wouldn't hang him.<br /><br />Finally, on page 97, almost half way through the book, we get to the material most readers were looking for when they pulled the book off the shelf: reading emotional states from facial expression:  The first lesson is on 'Sadness and agony.'  The following chapter addresses 'Anger.'  In all, Ekman describes 6 emotions:<br /><br />1. Grief, sadness<br /><br />2. Anger<br /><br />3. Surprise<br /><br />4. Contentment, Enjoyment, sensory pleasures:<br /><br />5. Fear<br /><br />6. Disgust, contempt<br /><br />Ekman apologizes for avoiding any discussion of<br /><br />1. Envy<br /><br />2. Guilt, shame and embarrassment.<br /><br />While exploring these emotions, Ekman uses the following format:<br /><br />1. A general description of the emotion<br /><br />2. A paragraph or two inviting the reader to 'make the face as a method of experiencing the emotion)<br /><br />3. A longer section, with photos and discussion of muscular mechanics, suggesting ways to recognize the facial displays associated with the emotion.<br /><br />4. A page or two on using the skill.  This is always a description of an interaction with a boss.  I didn't find these very useful.<br /><br />There seems to be a fundamental distinction between sadness and anger, one drives out the other.  Most people have heard of the 'fight/flight' dichotomy, but it turns out fight/flight emotions are very easily represented in the face simultaneously.  Sadness-Anger is a more telling distinction.  They don't coexist simultaneously.  One's emotions can swing from sadness to anger, and back, sometimes fairly quickly, but they don't show up on the face at the same time.<br /><br />The stark differences between the two, combined with the universality of expression, suggest expression and emotion are inextricably linked.  The author suggests making the expression of anger and/or sadness because making the expression produced the experience of that emotion.  Combine this with the fact that anger begets anger (both in the emotional individual and those that observe the sign) and sadness begets sadness and ultimately depression, and one can see that not only is the 'expression' the emotion, but the expression can drive the emotion.  Additionally, we respond entirely differently to sadness and anger.  When we see an expression of sadness, almost all are moved to comfort the sad individual.  This feeling is so strong that just looking at a photograph of a sad individual, particularly a familiar individual, elicits strong experiences of sadness in oneself.  When anger is expressed 'in the flesh', we may become enraged ourselves.  On the other hand, a photograph of rage rarely elicits rage all by itself.  For example, you can go to a tearjerker at the theatre and expect 50% of the crowd to be awash in tears.  A still photo of rage almost never elicits rage.  The viewer must know the individual's context in great detail to respond with rage.  On the other hand, people can be talked into rage (see mob behavior) with relatively little difficulty.<br /><br />Highly recommended.cular mechanics, suggesting ways to recognize the facial displays associated with the emotion. <br />4.

You don't need to know calculus to enjoy the book, but it helps.  There isn't any math, but love of numbers is omnipresent.<br /><br />The title is somewhat misleading. For about half the book, the title should have been 'my life as a physicist'.  The second half could be called 'rationalizations of a sinner', since the author clearly thinks predicting quark trajectories is moral, but pricing an option is at best neutral.  Further, there is no effort to relate theoretical physics to theoretical finance.  Derman is a professional mathematician and puzzle solver. The real delight is discovering the curious ways he can make himself useful. All the while, he wonders why his life has drifted away from pursuing a Nobel prize.<br /><br />Only a few comments (all attributed to Fischer Black) represent a 'financial perspective' Derman can accept. Alternatives to the 'physics model of finance' are dismissed with a variety of one-liners. Economics is dismissed as an educational error perpetuated by bureaucratic traditions.  Econophysics is dismissed as a French delusion. From Derman's perspective, an equity trader with any brains would realize the impossibility of projecting prices and quit.<br /><br />Dr. Derman uses the same critical razor for assessing his own failure to succeed in the traditional physics career (ie, win a Nobel prize).  His failures include ego, impatience, and limited brain power.  Of course, every line of the book suggests his brain power is second to none.<br /><br />The book follows traditional autobiographical forms.  We pick up the story with Derman going off to college in the 60s, and chronologically follow his ups and downs to 2001.  Along the way, he was lucky enough to regularly work with celebrities and wise enough to know they were celebrities in the moment. Early on, the celebrities are Nobel laureates. Late in the book, they are national leaders and financial intellectuals.  Some of these vignettes are touching, especially the long passages on Fischer Black, Derman's mentor.<br /><br />The little details make the book.  For example, there is a lot to learn from the way Derman got his break in finance. Despite his physics credentials, he gets a place on the 'team' (ie, work with Fischer Black) because he was good with programming user interfaces and screen graphics.ck, Derman's mentor.

Betting at a racetrack is a zero sum game from which the track takes a significant chunk of the wagers before anyone gets paid. Further, the people who know the horses best and can easily fix the race, the owners and trainers, are betting against you.  At best, only a minority can ever win.  The track requires the majority to lose, therefore avoid the majority play.  Only bet when two situations occur simultaneously: 1) you have well considered odds in your favor. 2) The public is betting your choice is a loser.  Put the two together, and be sure to have 3-1 or better odds in your favor. In other words, always think in terms of probabilities.<br /><br />Chapter 2. Things are easier now since the 'action' is more liquid and public opinion based on weak authorities.<br /><br />Chapter 3. Keep up to date on new angles: read what the professional reads.<br /><br />Chapter 4. The public doesn't lose their fair share. Statistically, they should only have 10% losses.  Instead, many lose everything they bring to the track.  They do this by allowing emotion to switch their betting style from one race to the next, and always switch at the wrong time.  If they just picked 'position 6' every time, they would only lose 10%, but they bet little when they should bet much, and much when they shouldn't bet at all.  It is the 'switches' that pull money from the public.  Having 'guts' means sticking with your strategy in the face of losses. You can count on the public being unable to demonstrate guts.<br /><br />Chapter 5. Ever changing cycles: The game will only last as long as people see enough winners to convince them they have a chance.  If the 'true' odds become obvious, no one would play.  Therefore, there must always be long shot winners and ceaseless change in the strategies of the winners. Early in the season, the public badly assesses the odds, the pros bet them and win.  Late in the season, the public loads up on the good horses, but this reduces the odds, so the long shots get undervalued and provide the winning odds.<br /><br />Chapter 6-7. Be aware the owners and trainers need not always focus on winning. Know what motivates the owner of the horse to enter the race. Are they building a reputation? Trying to win purses?  Trying to turn the public against the horse, then win as a long shot?  Understand the rules constraining owners and trainers. Know the claiming rules. Know how to read the weight reports.<br /><br />Chapter 8: Sum the odds. The odds are reported as 3-1, 4-1, etc, so it isn't obvious that the sum should be 100. Convert the odds to percentages and sum the list. If the sum of each horse's chance of winning is less than 100, bet on every horse and you are sure to win.  If you are sure a favorite won't win, you can create a sure win by betting on everything else (less than 100 sum).  The track is sure to make money if the sum is over 100.<br /><br />Chapter 9: Make your own price lines (100% books) and test them every day (paper workouts)<br /><br />Chapter 10: Pittsburgh Phil's system: buy the stuff that no one wants.  It takes guts to stick with the system.  It killed Pittsburgh Phil at 52.  It takes guts, that is why it doesn't matter if everyone knows the system.  Guts isn't the ability to ignore fear, it is the ability to stick to your original goal, process and strategy. (!!!!)<br /><br />Chapter 11: Money management: the obvious, don't spend your living expenses, but also, the important thing is your emotional balance.  Without balance, you switch and that is how to lose.<br /><br />Chapter 12: you cannot grind, you must speculate. You can't chisel, you must gamble. Accept and expect more losers than winners.<br /><br />Chapter 13-15: Reading the racing publications<br /><br />The rest of the book is a detailed plan for seasonal betting, January through December, one chapter per month.<br /><br />While reading, I speculated on how to apply this to the securities markets.What is a 'race', a day of trading? In terms of stocks, what are 'claiming races'? What are weights?<br /><br />The notion of  'ever changing cycles' is really interesting.  The 'racing game' is clearly a product of some evolutionary process that weeded out less robust 'betting markets'.  By looking at the 'game' as a whole, one can see it as an activity perfectly designed, but having no designer.  Most will lose, but still find it enjoyable enough to continue the playing.

The first section covers Dr. Elvin's frustrations with finding a teacher and the second lightly touches on trading techniques. This is all rather flimsy material, but represents a fair picture of the pitfalls facing anyone trying to 'learn' trading by sitting in classes.<br /><br />The 3rd section on 'perceptual bias' is very good, and obviously takes advantage of Dr. Ervin's 'real job', clinical psychology.  There is brief but concise descriptions of  the 'primacy error' (we are unduly influenced by experiences immediately prior to a decision), the 'availability error' (we tend to take the easy way out) and the 'Halo effect' (a good trait blinds us to the bad).  Other topics include the 'misplaced consistency theory,  the 'sunk cost error', 'prospect theory', 'self-deception bias', 'representativeness bias', and 'sampling bias' (law of small numbers).  As an answer to this, Dr. Elvin briefly argues against the Neo-Platonic efforts to exclude emotion from decision making, and recommends assessing one's Emotional IQ with a view to improve it.  A few well placed emotional disasters pulled from the author's trading experiences illustrate the points nicely.<br /><br />Concluding that emotional issues are the primary blame for trading disasters, the 4th section covers the delights of Zen meditation and taking on the self-image of a warrior-trader.  The book suggests this is the path the author finally chose.  We don't end here, though.  Instead, Dr. Elvin launches into a fascinating discussion suicide, the suicides of famous traders and gambling addiction, again with personal insights to his own dark moments.<br /><br />All of these materials are covered in more detail elsewhere, but Dr. Elvin's consistent reference to his own trading experiences provide a relevance missing in more academic work.  The summary chapter suggests the author was trying to write a model of trading competence.  Using this goal as a measure, the author has failed to deliver. The offered measures of competence seem designed for accountants.  The messy comments on assessing one's emotional IQ are hard to package in terms of competence. The juxtaposition of brave 'warrior trader' and 'suicidal trader' illusions speak to the difficulty of the subject.

The volume is written by a variety of contributors, but they follow an outline predetermined by the editors.  The material starts with an introduction to natural disasters (hurricanes and earthquakes), then reviews the primary 'technique' recommended by the authors: using GIS databases and sophisticated computer models to predict disaster costs (disaster models).  Unfortunately, the details of running these models are hard to communicate without giving the reader access to an interface of a sample model.<br /><br />Despite this difficulty, there is an excellent chapter detailing the legal battles between the insurance industry and consumer advocates.  The battle was fought after the Northridge, CA earthquake, and the GIS data and disaster models were the heavy artillery employed by the insurance brokers. The authors review difficult issues regarding 'fair premium price' determination for regulated retail insurance policies.  The purchasers of disaster insurance tend to see the brokers collecting risk-free profits. The brokers counter that the Northridge earthquake insurance payouts exceed all the premiums paid in California for over 20 years.  Elsewhere the authors mention hurricane Andrew insurance payouts exceeded all insurance payments ever collected in Florida.<br /><br />The final chapter covers 'terrorism insurance', and represents an excellent survey of issues facing the insurance industry after September 11.  One of the interesting issues raised in the mismatch between industry assessment of 'fair premium' and public assumptions that a 9/11 type disaster could not happen, again.  At least this is what sale of terrorism insurance demonstrates.<br /><br />The book will probably suggest more questions than it answers.  In particular, the chapter on terrorism raises interesting issues about 'governmental' coverage versus 'private' coverage.  At a certain level, victims of terrorism can expect taxpayers to 'aid' those suffering from the disaster. 'Aid' is another term for insurance, but 'coverage' is universal and payments hidden in various taxes.

I'm not convinced<br /><br />The book starts very well, documenting a strong historical relationship between 10 year annualized growth and the ratio of 'stock price' divided by either earnings or dividends. He covers this material several times, and always makes good use of it.  In short, the high price-earning ratios of 2000 were not sustainable.  The title argument is proven in chapter 1.<br /><br />The middle of the book is occupied by less compelling material.  First, we review what Shiller called structural factors.  These are facts such as the Internet and baby boomer demographics.  This includes a detour into popular delusions caused by our natural tendency to get excited by the enthusiasms of others, honest or otherwise.  Next, we cover what Shiller calls 'cultural' factors: news, popular concepts (both high-brow and faddish).  Not willing to rely on these simple distinctions, Shiller call psychology a 3rd area of interest.  In this section he covers what might be called 'behavioral finance' (psychological anchors and herd behavior).<br /><br />Much of this is fascinating material and highly recommended.  Unlike chapter 1, the implications are somewhat vague.<br /><br />Finally, after reviewing what amounts to thermodynamic laws 1 and 2 applied to average investment portfolios, Shiller concludes the government can do a better job.  Very specific comments on Social Security reform dominate the final chapter.  Unfortunately, none of the book lays any foundation for his policy advocacy (he hates privatization). I suspect one's political persuasion will determine how one reacts to the argument, since there is almost no background or survey of policy options provided.

The term 'Genetic Nutritioneering' is repeated a few time on every page. The material on genetics is highly simplified, and really has no impact on the nutritional advice.<br /><br />Bland suggests we take control of our genes, which isn't a bad idea.  In Bland's terms, we need to learn to 'express' the genes for health.  The genes that worked hard in youth can be encouraged to express themselves, again.  While this is a nice slogan, its meaning is very vague.  What isn't going to 'express' some gene?  What is key step in a gene's expression?  What causes a bad gene to be expressed?  How does one deal with a race between two genes seeking expression?<br /><br />The pragmatist wants some process for quickly assessing what a specific food or supplement will do for their metabolism.  Everyone has a somewhat different metabolism and somewhat different set of foods which are easy to digest.  Most of the people reading 'nutrition' books are interested primarily because they see their digestive system as unique and special.  Thus, it seems logical to look for advice that goes past 'population wide' recommendations.  Towards these ends, Bland is vague. For example, at one point Bland advises the reader to stop eating tomatoes for a few days.  This test will determine if tomatoes cause an unpleasant gene to be expressed, one that causes gastro-intestinal distress.  Most people would have run this simple test long before they knew anything about genetics.  At other times, Bland simply quotes the standard 'population wide' recommendation.<br /><br />In my view, the suggestions don't really rise above 'eat the right fruits and vegetables and you will feel better.'	2005-06-28

His methods include brain scans and skin based EEG studies.  His subjects are generally individuals exhibiting dysfunctional behavioral patterns.<br /><br />The cases with exceptionally bizarre behaviors are fascinating.  Unfortunately, his inferences from the data seem suspect, and occupy far too much space.  At some point in the book, there needs to be something along the lines of 'half of what I claim to be fact will be disproven in the next 20 years.'  Since this is missing, and much of the interpretive conjectures are weakly argued, the book is much less than it could have been.  If you are interested in the metaphysical materialist stance Ramachandran takes, you will probably enjoy a more complete discussion in Daniel Dennett's work.  If you are interested in a better interpretation of the neurological puzzles, see 'Animals in Translation' by Temple Grandin.<br /><br />The best part of the book is the first 'theme' chapter. Here we are introduced to a variety of bizarre 'broken connection' behaviors. For example, Ramachandran describes a man who exhibits Capgras syndrome after a car accident.  Upon coming out of the accident-induced coma, he is reported to have said \\"'Doctor, this woman looks exactly like my mother, but is an imposter.'  Even more amazing is that when mom calls the patient on the phone he instantly recognizes her voice and makes no imposter claims. He is coherent and intelligent in every other way.  Others with the syndrome have claimed their poodle is an imposter. The Capgras syndrome, Ramchandran explains is caused when nerves linking the visual centers and emotional centers are cut.<br /><br />Another exceptionally interesting case involves 'blind sight'.  In these cases, a broken connection between the eye and visual cortex blinds the individual.  Curiously, some individuals with damaged visual nerves still maintain connection between eye and the brain stem (limbic system).  These connections with our lizard brain are below consciousness.  Thus, the individual can claim no awareness of a visual stimulus, but can accurately guess the location of a bright light.  Watching someone 'find' the light, but deny any awareness of that which he points to can upset one's confidence in what 'awareness' happens to be.<br /><br />We briefly visit mirror agnosia: a failure to understand a virtual object in a mirror is a reflection.  The patient displaying the syndrome cannot reorient himself towards the 'real' image.  Instead, they are convinced the object is 'in the mirror.'  This, Ramachandran explains, is caused by damage to the right or left parietal lobe.<br /><br />Ramachandran does well to raise the issue of 'what is the physiological basis of the experience we call 'reality', but he doesn't take the next step: acknowledging that what we call 'reality' is simply one of an infinite number of possible maps (realities) we synthesize from the massive quantity of sensation that flood our neural system.<br /><br />The following two 'empirical' chapters fail to interest as much as the first.  'The Artful Brain' proposes several aesthetic laws for 'good art':<br /><br />1) Exaggerate forms infants instinctively recognize<br /><br />2) Challenge the brain to make inventive groupings<br /><br />3) Play peek-a-boo with the viewer (invite the imagination to fill in the blanks)<br /><br />4) Isolation (invite intense focus)<br /><br />Though Ramachandran fails to invoke any neurological justification for these 'laws', he eventually pulls in neurology by reminding us of autistic 'idiot savants', some of whom displayed exceptional artistic ability (knowledge of his laws).  He argues that these savants have 'bad wiring' which restricts them to a subset of normal brain areas, and these become hyper-functional.  Thisargument seems badly informed. Few argue that autism is 'bad wiring' at the macroscopic level.  In short, there isn't much meat here even if you ignore the blunders regarding autism.<br /><br />The last 'empirical' chapter addresses synesthesia, a sort of happy screw up in wiring.  People exhibiting synesthesia claim numbers evoke colors, taste evokes geometry, etc.  At a metaphorical level, we all can blend experience, but the synesthete experiences them as reality, with out the effort we generally must exert for metaphor to 'feel real'.<br /><br />Ramachandran claims synesthesia is cross-wiring, insufficient pruning of connections during development or simple neural over growth. Primary examples are linked with the temporal parietal occipital junction.  Again, the use of 'shape and geometry of connections' arguments is weak, with  vague allusions to 'higher order' connections elsewhere in the brain and no effort to explain the neural processes within the 'color' or 'number' areas of the brain which he wants to blend.  Despite the uncertainty he exhibits regarding the conjectured cross-wiring, he suggests the effects passed from generation to generation via genetics.  This seems to make Ramachandran giddy as he imagine a world populated with artistic synesthetes.<br /><br />In the final chapter, Ramachandran tries to update 'philosophy of mind' based on his research into neural wiring. Ramachandran chooses to focus on hysteria (mentally induced paralysis) and decisive action.  Hysteria, he deduces, is an over stimulation of the brain and Ramachandran effuses over the evolutionary benefits 'going limp' might have had when being attacked by a saber tooth tiger.  Ramachandran spends more time with decisive action experiments.  In these cases, he claims the experiments show the body exhibited preparatory behaviors a second before the test individual reports the decision to act had been made.  This, Ramachandran concludes, is evolution providing us with an illusion of 'free choice'.  For example, schizophrenics exhibit an extended delay and think an alien or demon made the decision.<br /><br />Though 'bad wiring' is undoubtedly an important feature of the cases presented, Ramachandran's inability to blend neural functions such as 'attention', 'memory', 'belief', 'awareness', etc with his musing upon one's neural wiring eventually seems one sided and unconvincing.s argument seems badly informed.

It starts with wonderful examples, but it ends with the far more numerous disasters.  If anything, Gladwell is too generous. Snap judgments are familiar to all of us. They are often at the beginning of some sequence of events we have regretted for years.  Gladwell suggests we take new interest in this dangerous decision making strategy.  Therefore, be warned.  This book can be dangerous to your health!<br /><br />The book is an extended collection of magazine articles and seems to skip from topic to topic.  The journey can be engaging, but the 'grand' theme gets obscured.  Fortunately, the book is a quick read.  Unfortunately, it doesn't cover anything in much depth.  The most glaring omission is any differentiation of neural activity in the enteric (gut), limbic (lizard brain) and neocortex (mammal brain).  But, it isn't necessary to know these neural mechanics to get something from the book and that is why many intellectuals will hate it.<br /><br />Gladwell suggest the odd notion that thinking in words can be counter productive to good decision making.  The argument has obvious merit to the pragmatist, but telling someone 'in words' to 'avoid words' is somewhat paradoxical and will cause the word academic intellectual much distress.  To make sense of this, Gladwell is advising a balance of word and action (rehearse, rehearse, rehearse).  But, how do you get the reality of this across in words.  Gladwell doesn't investigate this conundrum.<br /><br />Additionally, several arguments will upset the intellectual reader's sense of propriety.  First, Gladwell has the temerity to link genetics and intelligence.  Actually, Gladwell is smart enough to avoid the direct argument, but he does present an alias: genetics provide us with snap decision making skills, some people have better starter set than others.  For many academics, this is proof Gladwell should be sent to the gulag.<br /><br />It is tempting to dismiss the importance of snap decisions since the 'really important' decision must be reviewed and people have been arguing over how to decide things since time immemorial.  Don't take that escape route.  Consider the autistic individual, someone who has no social timing and cannot successfully decide what to focus upon.  This person will often never learn to speak.  The ability to make snap decisions is critical for simply existing as part of society. Understanding the process is central to assisting those who have difficulty joining us.<br /><br />Here is an outline of Gladwell's argument:<br /><br />1. The best decisions are snap decisions:  Gladwell has lots of examples demonstrating the idea that 2 seconds is about one we need:<br /><br />a) Reading faces in such a way it seem you can read minds (hint: Look for defensiveness, stonewalling, criticism and contempt)<br /><br />b) Saving museums from fraudsters.<br /><br />c) Winning wars<br /><br />d) Gambling to win<br /><br />2. Words are the enemy of good snap decision makers:<br /><br />a) gamblers in tests figured out stats for winning before they could 'tell' someone the rules<br /><br />b) sports greats don't know what they do that makes them win<br /><br />c) It is easy to unconsciously prime someone to act as you wish them to act<br /><br />d) The ventromedial prefontal cortex makes the decision and you can't control it<br /><br />e) We seem to have (at least)  two minds, conscious and unconscious. both are always working to find  answers, sometimes the conscious listens to the unconscious, sometimes it doesn't. Use of the 'conscious' mind can overshadow and supress the 'unconscious'<br /><br />3. Your starter set of 'snap decisions' will remind you of a 5 year old<br /><br />a) We cannot help but be attracted to tall dark handsome archetypes, so we elect empty suits<br /><br />b) Clinical tests prove almost everyone's snap decisions tend toward race and gender bigotry.<br /><br />4. But,don't give up.  Some have snap decision skills that can be developed:<br /><br />a) Learn the rules<br /><br />b) Practice the skills,<br /><br />c) Engage in full scale rehearsals (examples: army exercises and impromptu comedy)<br /><br />5. Roadblocks to training (1): verbal overshadowing:<br /><br />The left hemisphere thinks in words and the right hemisphere thinks in pictures. If you happen to watch a bank robbery, then describe the event in words, something happens. The words displace your visual memory and you can't identify the robber in a lineup. In another study, people who were asked to write about their thoughts solved 30% fewer puzzles than the control group who were allowed to simply cogitate.  Avoid thinking in words, they will hide anything your gut might have to say on the matter. Intellectuals are not going to like this advice!<br /><br />Gladwell's solution: put the words in a decision tree so you preprogram the information search to allow your gut a chance to get involved. (see cardiac arrest decision tree)<br /><br />6. Key roadblocks to training (2): misguided simulations<br /><br />a) Bad market surveys<br /><br />b) Bad military simulations<br /><br />Solution: Knowing how people make decisions is more important than any single fact or opinion.  (Gladwell is very brief here)<br /><br />7. Key roadblocks to training (3): stay in the zone (manage your body to insure you can think)<br /><br />The archetypal 'blink' disaster is a police shooting some innocent man.  Gladwell connects the high speed chase and group dynamics of the cop-car with the disaster.  The high speed chase put the body with adrenaline, thus predisposing the policeman to use the reactions of a 5 year old. In particular, a cop with elevated heart rate and lots of adrenaline cannot read faces as well as the calm cop might do.  Much of face reading is timing (something autistics lack) and in their 'rush' of the chase, cops will operate like autistics.  The group dynamics provide a false sense of 'order' since everyone in a chase is basically 'out of the minds'.  The solution is self-management.  Keep the heart rate low, don't rely on others, fall back on rehearsed responses.sion skills that can be developed: <br />a) Learn the rules <br />b) Practice the skills,  <br />c) Engage in full scale rehearsals (examples: army exercises and impromptu comedy) <br /> <br />5.

The high speed chase put the body with adrenaline, thus predisposing the policeman to use the reactions of a 5 year old. In particular, a cop with elevated heart rate and lots of adrenaline cannot read faces as well as the calm cop might do.  Much of face reading is timing (something autistics lack) and in their 'rush' of the chase, cops will operate like autistics.  The group dynamics provide a false sense of 'order' since everyone in a chase is basically 'out of the minds'.  The solution is self-management.  Keep the heart rate low, don't rely on others, fall back on rehearsed responses.	2005-06-26

This has been a challenging book to read, but well worth the effort.  It is a peculiar mix of memoir and introductory textbook on the enteric (gut) system.  I found myself woefully unprepared to consume the text.  Gershon has tried to write for the lay reader, but that lay reader had better be comfortable with organic chemistry. Despite the jargon, Gershon's enthusiasm is infectious.  This would be a great gift for any pre-med student in need of inspiration.<br /><br />The title is somewhat misleading.  'The second brain' is a catchy phrase, but only token effort is made to prove the assertion.  In simple terms, Gershon argues:<br />1. At the cellular level, enteric neurology uses the same building blocks as spinal neurology, so there is no evidence enteric neurology couldn't be a second brain.<br />2. The fundamental process managed by enteric neurology is the peristaltic reflex.<br />3. The peristaltic reflex requires sophisticated neurological controls for managing<br />a)  motion of food through the gut<br />b) control of pH, viscosity, appropriate digestive enzyme, etc.<br />4. Since the gut can function adequately despite cutting the neural connection between spine (brain) and gut, the neural mass in the gut must constitute an independent cognitive center (brain).<br /><br />The first 100 pages address Gershon's efforts to prove enteric neurology uses the same neurotransmitters as the spinal chord.  The second 100 pages offers a tour of the gut, starting at the mouth and walking down the lining to the colon. The final section provides a blow-by-blow description of his lab's trial-and-error experimental approach to enteric developmental neurology, with emphasis on microbiological techniques for examining the neural crest's role.  There is little or no text defining the systemic nature of a 'brain', and then asking if the enteric neural system qualifies for the title 2nd brain.  In short, Gershon avoids the quagmire of differentiating peristaltic reflex from peristaltic cognition.<br /><br />Since one cannot address this question without assimilating most of the material Gershon presents (perhaps without the historonics), and the book is so much fun as it is, who am I to complain?<br /><br />Important subtopics:<br />The academic battles Gershon fought to make enteric neurology an accepted academic field of study.<br />How 17th century European poisons help illuminate enteric neurology.<br />How cholera is perfectly designed to fool enteric defenses (including enteric neural signals).<br />A detailed review of developmental issues producing aganglionic megacolon (Hirschsprung's Disease)<br /><br />Scattered about are surprising literary references:<br /><br />\\"[the bowel's lining is] very much like the fields of Agincourt after Henry V finished dealing with the French army, a turf littered with the rotting remains of dead soldiers.

This is a compact and well designed introduction to ASL for infants.  The book is very small (about 4\\" x 4\\") and can go anywhere the baby goes.  The first 40 pages seek to motivate the reader (speaking babies who learn to sign test with higher IQs). The next 160 pages cover 'how', and aim to make the non-signing parent the perfect instructor.  The last 100 cover 60 signs.  Each sign is a two page layout with 'text' on one page and a photo demonstration on the other.  The words are: airplane, baby, ball, banana, baby, bear, bed, bird, blanket, car, cat, change, cold, cow, cracker, daddy, dance, dog, drink, duck, eat, elephant, finished, friend, gentle/pet, giraffe, go, grandma, grandpa, happy, help, horse, hot,  I love you, jump, keys, milk, mommy, monkey, more, mouse, music, no, pain, pig, play, please, scared, share, shoes, sign, sit, sorry, stop, swing, telephone, thank you/welcome, tiger, walk, water and where.  Briant highlights 10, calling them lifesavers: cold, gentle, help, hot, no, no-touch, pain, scared, share, stop.<br /><br />There are several interesting discussions about 'learning language'. In particular, Briant advises against 'teaching'.  Instead, she advises simply adding 'signs' to your normal chit-chat with baby.  It is just like a baby learning to verbalize English.  Mom and Dad just talk a lot around baby, and presto... baby starts talking.  Additionally, kids will pick up words that interest them most.  Briant begins the book describing a conversation with her 10 month old baby regarding elephants.  Her baby was terrified of elephants and thought any loud noise signified their presence.  It seems like a fairly advanced issue for 10 month olds to worry about, but fears and parental protection seem to be the sort of stuff babies are highly motivated to discuss.	2005-06-13

This is a riveting account of the minutes between two disasters: Two airliners crashing into the World Trade Center and 102 minutes later the collapse of North Tower.  While the focus is largely on individual office workers and their attempts to escape the inferno, the guiding narrative seeks to answer 'who knew the building would collapse?' and 'if they knew, when did the knowledge become manifest?'  As you can tell from the title, time is off the essence.  The WTC occupants had 102 minutes to get out.  If you were still inside at 10:08 AM 9/11/01, you didn't survive.<br /><br />For better or worse, the book follows the outline of Walter Lord's classic 'Titanic'.  The Islamic terrorists play the role of 'iceberg'.  According to the authors, building and operating the World Trade Center was as misguided a process as building the Titanic.  Leadership of the Port Authority, NY police department, New York Fire department, architects and authors of the 1968 building code received stern criticism for failing to anticipate or prepare for disaster.  As the authors repeat time after time, it was only a matter of time before a jet slammed into one of the towers.  The authors assign primary blame to the architect and greedy landlord who combined to produce a building that everyone should have known as a death trap.  Early on, we learn the fate of the World Trade Center was sealed 40 years ago when the architects reduced the number of stairways from 6 to 3. New York fire and police departments get heavy criticism for their inability to coordinate efforts, have adequate communication gear, and establish helicopter rescue procedures.  In a memorable scene, the Fire Department Chiefs were telling an engineer his 'tower collapse theory' was hog-wash at the same moment the south tower fell.<br /><br />These back-stories serve to build dramatic tension.  We the readers know so much more than the isolated individuals stuck within the doomed towers.  They didn't know the towers would fall, they didn't know the help was uncoordinated and confused; they didn't know the tower's design would make it impossible to escape.  And, they didn't even know that two jets, guided by Islamic terrorists had caused the whole tragedy. If you pick it up and start reading, be prepared to stay up all night.<br /><br />There were people in positions of authority who knew what was going to happen and acted appropriately, but they don't get any space in this book.  For example, Rick Rescorla, Viet Nam War hero and head of security for Dean Witter, was quoted within minutes of 1st jet's impact saying \\"\\"Everything above where that plane hit is going to collapse, and it's going to take the whole building with it. I'm getting my people [...] out of here.\\"  Using a bull horn, Rick marched the entire Dean Witter staff out of the building, and then lost his life returning to check for stragglers. Perhaps including Rick's story would have detracted from the dramatic effects the book sought to convey.<br /><br />In the end, one has to ask if the World Trade Center was more like the Lusitania or the Titanic.  The author's don't let such issues confuse the narrative.  Since few of the victims gave any thought to the issue, it is hard to argue with them.  The authors argue that building codes demand all skyscraper structural beams be fire proofed to withstand a fire for 120 minutes.  Neither tower met this requirement, so the architects of the WTC (as the architects of the Titanic) were culpable for the 1900 people who died after the 600 who perished in the crash itself.

The prologue establishes Tweed as a New York kingpin and sets the stage with Tweed's master stroke: a new 'self-rule' charter for the city of New York. The new charter was designed to give Tweed and 3 friends complete control of New York city finances. Their lock on the tax base was thought to be so secure their children's children would easily inherit the mantle (as may happen in Chicago). Unfortunately for Tweed, the charter scheme only lasted a few years. Tweed underestimated his enemies and eventually died in jail.<br /><br />I would argue the title misrepresents the text. We never learn much about Tweed's rise or political genius, if he possessed it.  In fact, we never really get to see inside Tweed's head at all.  He is simply the villan.  The narrative is a simple morality play, with the NY Times and Thomas Nast 'saving' New York from corrupt Tweed.<br /><br />Ackerman completely ignores the elephant in the bedroom: 'ward politics'. Ward politics is based on patronage. In return for a vote and/or assistance in 'getting out the vote', one can expect a kickback: a job, a license, a deed or some cash. By the time Tweed ran New York City, 'getting out the vote' with ward captains was a science. Ward healers were the social workers of the 19th century. When they thought it necessary, the ward captains were equally good at stuffing the ballot box. By omitting any discussion of ward politics, his narrative fails to connect with any real political dynamics. Ackerman never explains Tweed's fundamental source of power, so the book simply looks like a struggle between powerful personalities.<br /><br />Despite the nominal focus on city hall, this is fundamentally an extended homage to the New York Times. Tweed is mearly the target and scapegoat, we never get a look into his state of mind or his motivations. As written he is an extremely simple man. His life-goal is simple: steal money without getting caught. The details of his life all relate to the standard newspaper scandal plotline: evil politician covers up crimes. For example, Tweed's children are mentioned only to demonstrate his monetary focus. There is the standard mafia style wedding scene with wildly extravagant gifts followed by the standard back-office scene where Tweed transfers deeds to his kids in hopes of keeping the cash in the family after he goes to prison. Meanwhile, the mechanics of ward committeeman, ward captains and the patronage army go unmentioned.<br /><br />For some reason, contemporary historians shy away from a clear eyed investigation of American patronage organizations. Maybe it is too dangerous. The best available account is \\"Boss: Richard J. Daley of Chicago\\" by Mike Royko. The matter-of-fact accounting of Mafia like patronage operations are hard to accept, but that is the nature of the beast.tandard newspaper scandal plotline: evil politician covers up crimes.

The author seems to lament the 'good old days' when individuals were forced to relay their orders through brokers.  This offered brokers a wonderful insight on the directions markets would take since they had first hand information  about the next day's trading session, from the best and worst traders.  A broker can make a lot of money with that.<br /><br />Alas, these days are gone.  People now use electrical order placement systems and brokers are just as clueless as the retail traders. Pity.  Of course, few of us had this inside track and I'm not sure we need to lament its passing.<br /><br />The musings described above make up the bulk of the book. Here is a summary of the changes. Each of these topics is given chapter long treatment.:<br /><br />Intraday volatility:<br />New rule: Intraday share price volatility is on the rise.<br />Old rule: In the past, wide intraday share price swings were less common, and when they did occur they were often associated with unexpected geopolitical or economic developments.<br /><br />Trading like commodities:<br />New rule: Stocks are increasingly being bought and sold like commodities.<br />Old rule: In the past, institutions generally bought and sold stocks based on traditional methods of investment analysis, often with a longer-term perspective in mind.<br /><br />Approaches and attitudes:<br />New rule: Investing and reason frequently give way to speculation and emotion.<br />Old rule: In the past, institutional buying and selling was primarily driven by logic and measured analysis (although emotions have always influenced investor behavior).<br /><br />Information and communications.<br />New rule: More information and faster communications often have unexpected consequences.<br />Old rule: In the past, information tended to circulate around the marketplace in a slower and more orderly fashion, and the telephone was the primary means of communication.<br /><br />Derivatives:<br />New rule: Derivatives are exerting a growing influence on share prices.<br />Old rule: In the past, the action in the derivatives market was generally secondary to what took place in the underlying cash markets (except on certain occasions, such as Triple Witching Fridays).<br /><br />Seasonality and cycles.<br />New rule: Many seasonal and cyclical patterns are becoming less predictable.<br />Old rule: In the past, many seasonal and cyclical patterns were less widely known and were not affected by today's rapidly changing market forces.<br /><br />Form and fantasy.<br />New rule: Substance and reality increasingly give way to form and fantasy.<br />Old rule: In the past, data produced and distributed by companies, analysts, government agencies, and others was less subject to error, distortion, and manipulation.<br /><br />Market Indicators:<br />New rule: Many traditional market indicators are becoming less reliable.<br />Old rule: In the past, many market indicators were less widely known and were not affected by today's rapidly changing market forces.<br /><br />Global factors:<br />New rule: Global factors and foreign investors are exerting a growing influence on share prices.<br />Old rule: In the past, American investors and domestic concerns were much more relevant to the direction of U.S. share prices than overseas influences.<br /><br />The book is also sprinkled with 'action plans'. Here are few:<br />\\"...when a stock abruptly breaks out of a clearly defined trading range on relatively heavy volume, creating visual \\"gaps\\" on a daily bar chart, this is often a sign that a dramatic change in the outlook has taken place.\\"<br /><br />\\"When volatility begins to intensify after share prices have fallen for an extended period of time, it often indicates that a downtrend is nearing an end, at least in the short run.\\"<br /><br />None of this interests me a great deal.  Upon reflection, the title suggests a much better book, something along the lines of 'Post 2003 changes in securities trading rules, and how to use them for competitive advantage'.  This book would investigate the surreal world of Sarbanes-Oxley, how securities are added/subtracted from the Russell 2000, etc.ell 2000, etc.	2005-05-29

Second, the title is somewhat misleading and many readers should be warned. If you are looking for an improvement on 'The Horse Whisperer', this isn't your book. There isn't anything on talking to your pet or animals at the zoo. The author points this out on the first or second page, which leaves me wondering if the title was attached after the fact by a marketing guru. A more literal title would be something like \\"Using neuroscience and slaughter house malfunctions to understand mammal behavior\\" would be more accurate.  There is a great deal of violence described in this book, and almost zero sentimentality.  It will horrify many.<br /><br />Apparently, tales of the slaughter house don't turn my stomach. I loved it.<br /><br />Grandin launches into a bold description of animal/human psychology based on emotion rather than logic. Since Descartes published \\"I think, therefore I am (and animals don't, so they are not),\\" Western Philosophy has been trying to remove emotion from our understanding of 'being human'.  Emotion has become an evolutionary hang-over which the enlightened learn to defeat. Grandin puts emotion back into the logic of living, and does a great job of demonstrating her thesis with neuroscience and evolutionary theory.<br /><br />The narrative and outlook resonates with me. She isn't dividing the world into 'human' and 'animal' domains. When she is talking about translating animals, she is talking about translating the human animal, too.<br /><br />Grandin's basic insight comes from her efforts to relate to 'normal' humans. She writes, \\"The difference between a normal person's mental clutter and the intense, detailed absorption of an autistic person's visual concentration closely resembles the difference between humans and animals.\\" How does she know that animal thought parallel's her manner of 'thinking in pictures'? Initially, she simply assumed as much. It was only natural to assume other beings see the world as you do. In her case, it was a lucky guess, producing effective results and a successful career. Now that she can reflect on her success, she concludes it came from thinking in pictures, as non-humans do, but being enough of a 'language' thinker to communicate this insight to the rest of us. Normal people, Grandin writes, don't experience their perceptions directly. Instead, they experience a neocortex filtered summary which is assumed to be reality. For example, she tells of an experiment where subjects were told to watch a basketball video and count the number of passes. While they intently counted, a gorilla walks out onto the center court and jumps up and down. Over 50% of the subject failed to notice the gorilla. It wasn't 'expected', so they didn't see it.<br /><br />Grandin is agitating for a revolution in how cognition is understood. She is over turning the enthroned theories that animals only respond to 'operant conditioning' (rewards for desired behavior).  In its place she proposes 'social learning', an ability to learn from the example of peers.  She argues that operant conditioning fails as an evolutionary process.  If an antelope calf only learned to fear mountain lions after the experiencing a face-to-face encounter, there wouldn't be any antelopes to evolve.  Instead, calves learn by watching the reaction of peers and accepting that emotional response as reality. Social learning theory has recently gained momentum with the discovery of 'mirror neurons' that provide mammals with exactly this ability.<br /><br />The details are sometimes hard to grasp, but well worth the effort., producing effective results and a successful career.

Inventor/pioneer creates the technology<br />2. Merchant salesmen popularize the technology<br />3. Pirates then fight to monopolize the business<br />4. Responsible citizens call in a government regulator.<br /><br />These stages are established via a cartoonish detour into 16th century piracy. Captain Kidd, Blackbeard and the British crown serve as exemplars, but it doesn't work. For a much better review of the relationship between technology, pirates and government, see 'The Governors General'.<br /><br />Fortunately, things pick-up when we get to the real subject matter: electronic networks. The story really starts with Morse and his version of telegraphy. At this point, Spar can turn to the matters that really interest her: communication network regulations. The subject matter is of great interest and makes for easy reading.<br /><br />This isn't a technical history as much as legal history. Spar isn't very interested in technical infrastructure, 19th century job descriptions or the evolution of technology packaging. Her interest seems to be 'good regulation'.  I initially expected a broad brush history of electronic networks, but Spar is fairly selective in subjects.  We only focus on monopolies, generally first established via a patent or government grant.  The first is the telegraph monopoly of Morse, and the second Marconi's radio telegraphy monopoly.  Neither Morse nor Marconi established long term monopolies.  Later, she turns to less convincing monopolies in satellite television, computer operating systems, and music.<br /><br />I remain unconvinced her stages have any predictive value. As she warms to her drama about lawyers saving America from reckless young technophiles and profiteering businessmen, her pioneer/businessman/pirate/regulator scheme become something of a moral tale, and as such is both fascinating and banal.<br /><br />Spar omits any serious discussion of how networking companies used their role as 'news' distributors to secure the election of governmental figures willing to protect the corporation's economic agenda.  In particular, Spar fails to investigate the role of newspapers as consumers of network services and molder of public opinion.  The emergence of positive feedback loops between newspapers, political parties and network corporations never gets any attention.

This is the 'short history of man' theory.  A slight variation on this theme asserts mankind was 'unconscious' until about 6000 years ago, when the miracle of 'civilization' lifted the savages to our now enlighted state of grace.  Bishop Usher's reputation is fairly low among academic circles, but those who expound the milder 6000 year miracle of civilization have not shared his fate.<br /><br />They should.<br /><br />Seabright, like Usher, thinks human history so simple a matter that there is no need to explore the archeological and biological evidence for clues about the evolution of human nature.  It seems to be too obvious. Why waste time on something everyone knows?<br /><br />For example, Seabright reminds us over and over again that humans murdered all strangers until the dawn of civilization a few thousand years ago.  This simply isn't true.  All primates have strategies for mixing families.  For some species of primates it is the adolescent male, for some it is the adolescent female.  Either way, half the adolencent population is chasing strangers and the other half deciding how to respond to being chased.  It isn't intuitive, but that's what primates do.<br /><br />Over and over again, Seabright reminds us that cooperation is unnatural, a trend running counter to human evolution and selective advantage.  The argument simply doesn't hold up to the light of day.  Human muscle is, pound for pound, about 6 times weaker than chimp muscle. We have been breeding out serious muscle advantage, and associated dominance, for millions of years.<br /><br />Seabright's story isn't much different than the one told in 1784 by Henry Home, Lord Kames (Sketches of the History of Man).  Lord Kames proposed a \\"four-stage theory of history\\": hunting-gathering, herding, farming and modern-commerce.  Kames lauched a thousand research projects, including Darwin's adventures.  We now know a lot more about human evolution and we learn more every day.

We start with John Law's central bank and the Mississippi Bubble it created.  From that disaster (and concurrent lessons for the wise), we move on to subsequent financial bubbles and additional lessons.  Each bubble is explained with almost cartoonish simplicity, but the cartoons are entirely iconoclastic.  Rather than be exhaustive, the book seeks to be thought provoking.<br /><br />The second half of the book addresses 'cycle' theories, but Tvede can't do much more than convince us the role of cycles remains problematic.  Mixed in are tales of George Soros, which only confuses the plot line.<br /><br />Tvede gives considerable attention to famous traders, including the trading performance of economists who actually invested according to their theories.  Here is a list of those covered:<br />Great traders:<br />Cantillon(1720): folded his positions in French Mississippi boom and got the gold to England before it was too late<br />Jay Gould(1869): Used connections with President Grant to corner the gold market and liquidate prior to collapse<br />Jesse Livermore(1920-34): Used bear raids during the 29 crash<br />John Maynard Keynes(1920-1940): Traded through the 1929 crash with 30% gains during the 30s (depression)<br />Milton Friedman (1980s): helped create financial futures<br />George Soros(1980-present): Currency raids on European bankers<br /><br />Missing is any discussion of the economic role of taxes, crime, corruption and organized violence (war and terror). Additionally, Tvede doesn't explore the role of printed financial news in financial booms, only the role of printed (paper) money.  For example, Tulip mania in Holland during the 17th century predates paper money and central banks, but coincides with the first 'newspapers'.<br /><br />Finally, there is no discussion of agent based economic models or 'cycle generator' processes.  For example, the opening chapters on Law is clearly triggered by a generational shift (Louis XIV's debts must be paide by Louis XV's generation), but the role individual life cycles might play in economic cycles goes unexplored.<br /><br />In theoretical terms, Tvede is primarily interested in relating cycles to the formula MV = PQ (M=Money, V=Velocity of money, P=Prices, Q=Quantity).  For example, considerable attention is given Friedman's trilemma: a central bank can't do all three of the following:<br />1. Maintaining exchange rates<br />2. Control price levels<br />3. Allow Free trade<br /><br />As Tvede describes Friedman's position, everyone wants free trade, including foreign exchange trading.  This makes stable exchange rates impossible to maintain if a country is to defend its population from the hardships of an economic cycle's end (provide soft landings).  From this, a trader can plan to short currencies with central banks who traditionally defend exchange rates.  The exchange rate is 'P', The 'defending' central bankers are trying to hold this constant.  At the same time, they are attempting to hold 'Q' constant, providing their population with a stable 'standard of living'.  What they cannot control is 'MV', or the amount of capital that leaks out of the system in search of better investment opportunities.<br /><br />chapters 1-4  Monetary reactions to financial cycles (primarily end of cycle crisis) 1720 to 1875.  The rise of classical economics<br /><br />Chapter 5-6 Cycle analysis (time series analysis, data mining) 1862-1910<br /><br />Chapters 7-10 Non-computational efforts to unify classic and cyclic analysis (1910-1939)<br /><br />Chapters 11 to 19 Computational economics: simulation, feedback, and chaos with a major digression regarding George Soros and currency trading.n Law is clearly triggered by a generational shift (Louis XIV's debts must be paide by Louis XV's generation), but the role individual life cycles might play in economic cycles goes unexplored.

The book is not a 'how-to' guide as much as a 'how I figured it out' or 'how I got the rock to the top of the wall.'  Those with masonry experience will probably find this unnecessary, but anyone considering a masonry adventure will find the reading well worth the effort.  Mr. Long's experiments in man-handling rock, using ramps and building scaffolds are exactly what amateur masons need to read.<br /><br />The book if fairly shy about the author's handiwork.  The finished house is never displayed, and 'example' photos are generally shots of 19th century buildings. Additionally, there is nothing on how long it took to accomplish their tasks. There are lots of photos showing the author and wife man-handling rocks, though.<br /><br />The book seems to be set in the north-eastern United States, and Mr. Long's advice for finding rocks may be unsuited to other areas.  As best I can tell, the book advises picking up a suitable rock when ever one one. This might happen on the shoulder of a highway, while driving past a farmer's field or wandering around old quarries.  Mr. Long suggests all non-masons are overjoyed when anyone hauls away a rock.  I'm not convinced.	2005-04-07

We follow the 'soul of the machine' from conception in beer halls and bordellos to 'graduation' when Nobel prizes are awarded..  We watch the first documented design get put down on paper (basically scribbled on the napkins of a German coffee shop).  As always, the coincidences of birth are astounding.<br /><br />Rather than dwell on theory, Cathcart frames 'building the machine' firmly within 1920s living conditions.  We walk through Cambridge with new PhD students who end up doing the grunt work.  We join them in the 'nursery,' where they learn the mind numbing use of scintillation screens. We learn that the lab didn't have a 24x7 electrical supply and everyone had to go home at 6 when the generators were turned off.  When the atom is finally split, Cathcart contrasts the news accounts with reports that got bigger headlines (a peeress was robbed the same day).<br /><br />Though the subtitle suggests something of a competition was being run, the race gets little attention (if it existed at all).  The dramatic tension is generated by contrasting tea parties with 'lab time' and suggesting the 'lab time' couldn't happen without the parties.<br /><br />This is a history of 'big physics'.  Particle physics is not cheap, and I wished Cathcard explored the fund raising activities with more enthusiasm.  He concludes his book by quoting Rutherford: \\"We were like children who need to know how it worked,\\" but this doesn't explain how the monumental costs of the particle accelerator were raised in the depths of the depression.<br /><br />If you liked Tracy Kidder's 'Soul of a New Machine,' you should like this a great deal.	2005-04-01

If so, the effort was unsuccessful.  Panek makes a good argument for identifying gravity and consciousness as the two key mysteries left unexplained by 20th century science, but his arguments that Einstein and Freud shared a common ethos or methodology fall flat.  Additionally, the reader is left suspicious that such a link might still be found.<br /><br />The book relies heavily upon 'history of science' style stories about Einstein.  Historians of science have worked out methods of presenting Einstein's breakthrough insight, light moves at a constant speed through out the universe, in understandable stories which can engage the non-technical reader.  There is no need to bore the reader with wave mechanics, Lorenz functions, field dynamics or statistical physics, the notions are communicated in simple thought experiments and parables.<br /><br />The same cannot be said for Freud's investigations of consciousness.  Unlike the evocative history of Einstein and atomic energy, historians of psychology have generally dismissed Freudian notions. For Panek to interest us in Freud, this 'Freud as huckster' image must be over turned. Early in the book, Panek suggests Freud's perspective was founded on neuro-anatomy, a pure science few will link to Freud.  Since neuro-anatomy is slowly emerging from an era where the brain was simply a 'black box' that worked, the reader might wonder if Freud really had something to say about neurology. If so, it might be of real interest.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the connection with neurology is abandoned in the second half of the book.  Panek instead reviews 'Positivism', the view that we can be positive about certain truths and only those truths can be the subject of science.  Positivism has an odd place in contemporary philosophy-of-science.  It is both 'entirely discredited in detail' and 'widely accepted in general'.  In other words, it is a fine 'working premise', but don't ever write it down because it cannot be defended.  Both Freud and Einstein were members of the founding Positivist society, and thus both played a role in its failures.  This negative relationship will convince few readers Einstein and Freud had anything in common.<br /><br />The failures of Positivism make an interesting history, but Panek isn't prepared to tell that story.  It includes mention of  the paradox of Schroedinger's Cat, Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle, and Godel's Incompleteness theorem.  None of these issues make it into the book, so Panek's review of Positivism is hollow at best.fine 'working premise', but don't ever write it down because it cannot be defended.

The rhetoric relies on emotion to bridge logical leaps, hides a distain for cause and effect relationships and sidesteps questions about human nature.  Instead, Barber carelessly brews a mix of hip buzzwords and mass marketing clich&eacute;. If you read this tome, be prepared for endless repetition of 'the capitalist is dangerous, but united the people cannot be defeated':  Repeat the following 5 or 10 times and you have the book in a nutshell: \\"Jihad pursues a bloody politics of identity, McWorld a bloodless economics of profit. Belonging by default to McWorld, everyone is a consumer; seeking a repository for identity everyone belongs to some tribe. But no one is a citizen. Without citizens, how can there be ...\\" {fill in the blank with any utopian quality: justice, happiness, equality, etc.}<br /><br />The central problem for 21st century Marxists is updating the logic of class struggle.  In the first half of the 19th century Marx taught a strict evolutionary progression from noble-savage to slavery, from slavery to feudalism, and from feudalism to capitalism.  Within a few years, Marx predicted, capitalism would collapse and the unavoidable socialist utopia would emerge.  Of course, the collapse didn't happen and Marxist have been rationalizing ever since.  Lenin had to add the Imperialist phase.  21st century Marxist need to show imperialism mutating into  global consumerism.<br /><br />Towards this end, Barbour argues:<br />1. Capitalists have shed their 'nationalist' identity, finding it easier to enslave the proletariat via media manipulation.<br />2. Media manipulation (global consumerism) seeks to replace indigenous cultural identities with slavish loyalty to global products.<br />3. 'Wild Capitalism' promoting global products causes criminal damage to indigenous communities, and threatens environmental catastrophe.<br />4. Protecting these indigenous communities (victims) will require violence (socialist revolution).<br /><br />Hidden beneath this victim-oppressor dualism lies the traditional Marxist faith in central planning or 'government by intellectuals.' Democracy can be dismissed because the 'means of communication' are held by the multinational capitalist elite.  And, Marxist don't need an elections, as intellectuals they already know what is best for everyone else. Thus, Barber spends the second half of the book describing the failures of democracy. Barber asserts that \\"the epoch on whose threshold we stand -- post communist, postindustrial, post national, yet sectarian, fearful, and bigoted -- is likely also to be terminally post democratic.\\"<br /><br />Time has not been kind to Barber.

Books	3	5	6	N	N	Entertaining history	If you like Paul Harvey's radio factoids, \\"The rest of the story\\", you will like Circles.  Burke takes the genre to a different audience, though.  I'm reminded of Luis Bunuel's Le Charme discret de la bourgeoisie.  In 'Circles, curiosities of class, wealth and intellectual frailty get center stage.  For example, Chapter 2 of 50 is devoted to musings about a broken porcelain cup.  This leads us to Wedgwood, (who the class conscious will know), and Wedgwood reminds Burke of one William Hamilton and his favorite mistress, Emma Lyon. Mr. Hamilton was an 18th century expert on Pompeii and seems to have exchanged his sketches of pots for Ms. Lyon.<br /><br />As introduced, few will recognize either William or Emma.  But, if you know the rest of the story, Emma turns out to be the leading character in several Hollywood moral plays such as 'That Hamilton Woman' (1941), 'Lady Hamilton' (1968), 'Lady Hamilton' (1921), 'The Divine Lady' (1929).  Burke finds the Napoleon-Nelson-Hamilton affair a curious nexus of international politics, art and high-culture, then brings us back to his porcelain cup via Coleridge, Samuel Morse, and 19th century railroads.<br /><br />Enjoy.	2005-03-13

His version of Zen Buddhism was regularly broadcast on the newly emerging FM radio stations that served the booming teen market.  As a teenager, one of these broadcasts introduced me to Zen and I've always appreciated Alan's efforts to bring me that message.<br /><br />I was surprised to discover Watts ending his life at the relatively young age of 58.  According to Furlong, he averaged a bottle of vodka per day during his last years.  He passed away in his sleep, probably from heart failure.  To the end, he maintained a workaholic lifestyle which supported two ex-wives, wife number 3, and a steady stream of affairs with innocent young women enchanted by his 'talk'.  He was survived by all three wives and at least 7 children.<br /><br />Alan started his life in England and grew up in 'public' schools.  In his teens (1934) he published his first book on Zen Buddhism.  He continued writing on the subject for the rest of his life.<br /><br />He seems to have dodged the British draft in 1939 by moving to America, and dodged the American draft in 1941 by enrolling in an Episcopalian seminary.  In the mid 40s, he took up the role of college chaplain and remained one for about 5 years.  At that point, a dramatic affair with a beautiful coed ended the priestly career and first marriage.  His later career as a free-lance writer and lecturer-at-large was shaped by this scandal.<br /><br />And, does any of this matter?  Does his alcoholism color how one reads his books or listens to his recorded lectures?  This question is the focus of the biography. Furlong concludes it doesn't. Watts was the 'coyote' of Native American legend, bringing fire to mankind, but getting his tail burnt in the process.  Exactly how he fit into the 'beat' and 'hippie' movements is never directly addressed, though Furlong connects Alan with all the key names. There isn't a serious effort to explore Zen, either.  The focus is more personal, modern and western:  Do the private weaknesses of your favorite celebrity change your reaction to the 'message' that celebrity delivers via TV, movies or radio?<br /><br />If this sounds interesting, you might want to look into 'The Golden Guru'.stern:  Do the private weaknesses of your favorite celebrity change your reaction to the 'message' that celebrity delivers via TV, movies or radio?

There isn't a lot of theory, and the author is somewhat embarrassed that the Democratic Party perpetrated almost all his examples.<br /><br />Here is a summary of the contents:<br /><br />Chapter 1: Vocabulary and positions (author cites pre-2000 examples of election fraud, both Republican and Democrat)<br /><br />Chapter 2: How the Democratic Party in Florida altered votes and almost gave the state to Gore (2000).  The standard trick was taking a stack of ballots and running a needle through the 'Gore hole'.  If the ballot was already marked for Gore, nothing changed, if it was marked for Bush, there was a double vote and the ballot was void.<br /><br />Chapter 3: How absentee ballots are used to steal elections.  Under the guise of 'voter registration' drives, candidates give money to independent 'registration' contractors.  This provides a legal protection should the 'contractor' ever be convicted of registering dead people, pets, felons and/or non-citizens. Examples are drawn from California, Florida and Colorado.<br /><br />Chapter 4: Using corrupt judges to steal elections.  The entire chapter is devoted to St. Louis and the 2000 senate election.<br /><br />Chapter 5: Using fake ballots (stuffing the ballot box) in Texas (2000).<br /><br />Chapter 6: Using Indian reservations in South Dakota to steal elections.<br /><br />Chapter 7: Appointing your friends to the election commission, and having them throw out the vote of anyone who disagrees with you (Hawaii)<br /><br />Chapter 8: This chapter covers 'Computerized voting'.  Rather than cite examples of computers enabling fraud, the chapter only debates the possibility of their use in fraud.  Overall, Fund like the computers.<br /><br />In the final chapter, Fund makes a few recommendations:<br /><br />a) Get involved, don't let the lawyers steal your vote!<br /><br />b) Before the elections, get election rules established for addressing voter fraud in a timely manner, especially for 'provisional ballots'.<br /><br />I heard the author speak on my local public radio station prior to the 2004 election.

The prosecutor, a government official, who is often standing for election, must bring the case to trial.  This invariably polarizes half their constituency since no one thinks 'their party' could commit voter fraud.  Since elected official can rarely risk enraging any block of voters, the cases are politely lost.<br /><br />Second, the whole election process relies on thousands of volunteers.  These volunteers are generally pulled from the 'World War II' generation, and baby boomers are not filling in as they depart.  This leaves allows the 'political activist' class to run the election.

I suspect 300 of the 450 pages are unnecessary.  Despite this, some of the insights are well worth the effort one must invest to push through the book.  The first 100 pages have all the meat.  The next 200 are optional.  The last 150 are counter productive.<br /><br />The book proposes a theory by which language emerges from the innate human catalog of emotional states instead of 'logic'.  Rather than argue language was 'built' as a 'logical' solution to a dangerous world, they argue that language is a technique for managing or 'avoiding' catastrophic emotional reactions.  According to the authors, the caregiver - infant pair who can 'dance' their way through unexpected and frightening events without panic, survive and thrive. They do this by developing a shared set of gestural/auditory icons representing past, present and future emotional states.  By shifting  rising catastropic emotions like fight and flight out of the 'present state' and into 'icons of the dance', the pair can modulate emotional extremes.<br /><br />Think about it.  Could 'emotion' be the bedrock of logic?<br /><br />Thinking about this, I was immediately struck by my inability to clearly describe 'emotions'. Are there 2 emotions? 4 emotions? 8 emotions? The shortest list of 'emotions' is binary: fear and anger.  A slightly longer list includes 6 emotions: happy, angry, surprise, disgust, fear, sad.  Once you get in the mood, the list can get pretty long: Acceptance, Anger, Anticipation, Boredom, Disgust, Envy, Fear, Guilt, Hate, Joy, Jealousy, Love, Remorse, Sorrow, Surprise, Curiosity, Fascination, Confusion, Anxiety, Bewilderment, Frustration, Chagrin, Despair, Hope, Satisfaction, and Confidence.  And, there are a variety of emotions which are hard to encapsulate in a single term:  'it is finished', 'I know that', 'I understand'.<br /><br />If this long list were not confusing enough, there is the common distinction between 'feeling' and 'emotion'.  Many use the term 'emotion' to describe 'that which is remembered about a feeling'.  Others reverse this, calling 'emotion' the precursor to 'feeling'.  Personally, I prefer calling 'emotion' primordial or instinctive, something that emerges from the deepest aspects of our souls.  In my view, 'feelings' are the memories of 'emotion'.  It is just my vocabulary, and many may use an entirely difference scheme for describing what they experience.<br /><br />Thus, the assertion that 'language is rooted in emotion' is hardly helpful unless there is a detailed treatment of what the authors mean by 'emotion'.  Such a discussion will not be found anywhere in the book's 450 pages.<br /><br />As I understand it, the authors are arguing that language emerges from the 'dance' infant and caregiver join. The 'dance' is composed of rhythmic 'action' and 'absorb reaction' states which both infant and caregiver cooperatively alternate between.  This dance is initiated by the baby when he instinctively seeks to capture the attention of the caregiver by offering a 'stimulus' (crying, smiling, etc.). If the action (a smile) captures the attention of the caregiver, a 'happy' exchange can ensue (the dance).  If the baby cannot capture the attention of the caregiver, it will often increase the energy of the stimulus (smile becomes vocalization, becomes crying, etc.) until exhausted or entirely frustrated.  The authors suggest this pattern is inate to all human infants (and most mammals). Further, if the infant demonstrates limited interest or capacity for this dance, there is probably going to be an IQ or psychological problem exhibited in later years.<br /><br />Given this 'dance' which infant and caregiver engage in, language is seen as a refinement which allows greater control of both external 'reality' and internal emotions.  Just as ballroom dancers will learn specific 'moves' and then sequences of moves, there will naturally emerge collaborative patterns which represent or symbolize emotional states.  Sequences of these states can elicit predictable 'new' emotional states. Memorizing 'moves in the dance' involves defining boundaries and key signals.  The process forms the foundation for memorizing words.  The pattern of the dance becomes the 'sentence'.<br /><br />In terms of the caretaker's interactions with babies, the dance is memorized and eventually develops the pair's ability to negotiate undesired or unexpected experiences in life without catastrophic emotion (fear, anger, despair, etc.).  The catastropic emotions close out an opportunity for cooperation.  The non-catastrophic emotions include joy, curiosity, acceptance, anticipation, etc. If cooperation is essential for the survival of one or both partners, the management of emotional states are all important.<br /><br />All this is outlined within the first 50 pages, and it represents an interesting proposal for the evolution of human language.  Unfortunately, the following 350 pages of supporting arguments are tedious.  In particular, the authors repeatedly refer to a table of `functional emotional developmental levels':<br />1. Shared attention and regulation (from birth)<br />2. Engagement and relating (2 to 4 months)<br />3. Two way intentional emotional signaling and communication (4 to 8 months)<br />4.

Building bridges between ideas, logical thinking (2.5 years on)<br />7. etc.<br /><br />This developmental pattern (the Affect Diathesis Hypothesis) is then the scaffold from which `an explanation of everything' is constructed.

They were impatient with the hesitant, gradual attempts of those we now see as orthodox...\\"  Elsewhere, he writes, \\"Since the early modern era, a number of historians and theologians have tried to demonstrate that the heretics - the  innovators, the nonconformists, the protesters - were the truest and best imitators of Christ...\\"  Thus, the book establishes its guidelines.  Heretics are smart, sophisticated, impatient and the truest Christians.  The notion is a bit too conveniently modern for my taste.<br /><br />In scope, the book represents a fairly conventional 1980s historiographic tour of Christian controversies.  The style is highly interpreted and psychological.  Ancient text is rarely allowed to speak for itself.  Post World War II archeological discoveries are ignored.  The author regularly describes a world without doctrinal diversity: \\"The first congregations were...\\", \\"the first heretics were...\\", \\"Gnosticism was a response ...\\"<br /><br />I found Dr. Brown's analysis of the first and second centuries the most problematic. Once we start to approach the fourth century the arguments become more 2 dimensional, but one has to wonder if the relatively thoughtless start can do anything but undermine the rest.	2005-02-22

Don't waste your time with my review.  Get the book and read it.<br /><br />Perhaps the subtitle should have been 'History of the Blogosphere.' Hillary provides a common focus for the dissenters, but the heart of the book is personal biographies of key dissenters: Matt Drudge, Chris Ruddy, David Horowitz, Carl Limbacher, Barbara Olson, Bernard Weinraub, Ambrose Evans-Pritchard, Andrew Sullivan, Hugh Hewitt, James Robinson, LJ Davis, Joe Farah, Gary Aldrich and a host of others. Some came from leftist politics (Farah, Horowitz and Sullivan); some were Internet news junkies (Drudge, Robinson, and Limbacher).  Some came from newsrooms (Ruddy, Evans-Pritchard). The common thread is that all these individuals risked or sacrificed home and career to warn people about the Clinton Whitehouse extortion (Arkansas mafia), bribery (ChinaGate), blackmail (FileGate) and murders (Foster, Parks and Brown).<br /><br />This is in stark contrast to the way the Clinton Whitehouse spun the Internet phenomena to ABC, NBC and CBS.  This perspective was outlined in an internal Clinton Whitehouse memo: \\"The Communication Stream of Conspiracy Commerce\\". Let me quote from the opening lines of the report: \\"'The Communication Stream of Conspiracy Commerce' refers to the mode of communication employed by the right wing to convey their fringe stories into legitimate subjects of coverage by the mainstream media. This is how the stream works. First, well-funded right-wing think tanks and individuals underwrite conservative newsletters and newspapers such as the Western Journalism Center, the American Spectator and the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review. Next the stories are reprinted on the Internet where they are bounced all over the world. From the Internet, the stories are bounced into the mainstream media ... After the mainstream right-of-center American media covers the story, congressional committees will look into the story. After Congress looks into the story, the story now has the legitimacy to be covered by the remainder of the American mainstream press as a 'real' story.\\"<br /><br />Obviously, anyone with a critical intellect can investigate the validity of the two story lines.  Here is a recap of the book so you have some keywords:<br /><br />Introduction: A definition of the term 'conspiracy'<br /><br />Chapter 1: An example of Hillary Spin: Viacom erases boos, replaces it with cheers and rebroadcasts to millions.<br /><br />Chapter 2: Hillary's desire to censor Internet, Hillary's enforcers, use of FBI files to blackmail opponents.<br /><br />Chapter 3: Andrew Sullivan fired from print magazine for 'Ice Queen/Drag Queen' Hillary story, sets up shop on Internet.<br /><br />Chapter 4: A tale of two leftists, Hillary and David Horowitz. One came to his senses, but it cost him his cushy lifestyle.<br /><br />Chapter 5: How the news junkies started to collaborate via Usenet groups.<br /><br />Chapter 6: Chris Ruddy, former schoolteacher, scoops NYT on Vince Foster and loses newspaper job, joins Internet.<br /><br />Chapter 7: Hillary goes on the attack with the \\"Communication Stream of Conspiracy Commerce\\", but Hillary hit man, Weiss wakes up and leaks document.<br /><br />Chapter 8: The rise of Matt Drudge.<br /><br />Chapter 9: The Internet's fact checking role comes of age with ChinaGate and Ron Brown's murder.<br /><br />Chapter 10: Why conservatives have all the fun.<br /><br />Chapter 11: Climax: the Clinton Whitehouse's attempt to shut down Drudge with $145 million lawsuit.<br /><br />Chapter 12: Jim Robinson, the rise of FreeRepublic and how Freepers kept Gore from stealing the 2000 election.<br /><br />If you have the ability to step back and try to gain an objective view of the battle between Internet dissenters and the Clintons, consider the issues in terms of the mass-marketing industry that powers broadcast networks like Viacom (CBS), Disney (ABC) and GE (NBC).<br /><br />What do mass-marketers need?  They need large compliant and conforming market populations. They like standard brands and a limited set of celebrities who all lead model lives.  They don't want confusion, debate and critical thinking.<br /><br />Research on conformity began in 1951, when Solomon Asch studied groups of seven to nine people who were told they were participating in a study on visual perception.  These subjects were asked to match the length of a standard line to three comparison lines.  One would think that this would be a relatively easy exercise, but Asch's groups only contained one real subject.  The rest of the group was made up of confederates who were instructed to unanimously give incorrect responses in some trials.  The results of this experiment found that the control group made errors only five percent of the time.  Those exposed to the incorrect responses conformed to these answers 33% of the time, with 75% of these subjects conforming at least once.  This shows how easily it is to make a person conform in a group situation.<br /><br />The challenge for mass marketers is isolating an individual, surrounding the subject with 5 or 6 confederates who will repeat only the 'marketing line' and illicit effective conformity and compliance.  It turns out repeated television advertisements effectively perform this duty and the subjects will enjoy the experience.<br /><br />The fly in the ointment for mass marketers is a lone dissenter, a devil's advocate. The dissenter allows others who may have questions to voice their objections. The dissenter gives other potential dissenters an ally. Asch showed in his studies that just one other person who disagrees with the group decreased conformity substantially. Milgram also found this to be true.  If the subject hears only one dissenting voice, the probability they will abandon their own opinion drops. In terms of the emperor's new clothes, the scales fall from the eyes and the guy is just naked.<br /><br />I've been following Ruddy, Drudge, and FreeRepublic for years. This was the first opportunity to see past the byline and get to know a bit about the individuals.  Despite the turgid subject matter, the book offers great hope.

I've had a lot of fun sharing them with friends.  Consider the title claim: \\"Why the Many are Smarter than the Few\\".  This is not particularly straightforward.  If crowds are smart, why are herds so stupid? Yes, \\"two heads are better than one\\".  But, \\"a camel is a horse designed by committee\\".  If two are smarter than one, is two-thousand-one smarter than two-thousand?<br /><br />Surowiecki starts with a puzzling factoid: a collection of uninformed opinions is an informed opinion. 'Guess the jelly beans in the jar' examples demonstrate this.  Ask any crowd the number of jelly beans in a jar, and the average guess is statistically correlated to the 'actual' count.  This game gets a bit more complicated when the 'crowd' is asked to guess how many jelly beans I'm thinking of putting in the jar (democracy) or 'guess how many jelly beans the crowd will drop in the jar' (the stock market), but there is a linkage between all 3 questions.<br /><br />The next 4 chapters try to identify preconditions for 'crowd wisdom':<br /><br />1. Diversity of opinion (Chapter 2)<br /><br />2. An information cascade that convinces first 2 or 3, then larger and larger groups, that 'a 3rd party idea is better than mine'. (Chapter 3)<br /><br />3. A decentralized decision making process which allows 'the best solution' a chance to be the 'chosen' action for the group.  This includes protection from those that might disagree with your opinion. (Chapter 4)<br /><br />4. A mechanism for 'members' to keep up with behavior of the whole. For Surowiecki, this role is filled by 'markets' reporting 'current prices'. (Chapter 5)<br /><br />In the process of covering all these issues, we have gone from 'counting jelly beans in a jar' to 'designing successful organizations'.  The new focus is entertaining, but Surowiecki seems to lose grip of his subject matter.  In one chapter concern for the well-being of group members is necessary to support diverse opinion, in the next the concern for 'well-being' is a source of 'group-think' and 'no changes allowed' attitudes.<br /><br />Though Surowiecki might disagree, much of the remaining material tries to make sense of self-interest.  Specifically, does 'self-interest' hinder or inspire 'crowd wisdom'?  We get a variety of case studies, but most readers will find Chapters 7 thru 12 simply wander.  Chapter 7 addresses the 'selfish' automobile driver.  We need that driver to be interested in protecting his own 'life', to trust that he won't drive on the wrong side of the road.  But, too much self-interest produces 'road rage'.  Chapter 8 addresses the 'selfish scientist', who at times honorably seeks professional recognition for his work, but at times will use tenure to squash the ideas of upstarts.  Chapter 9 addresses the paradox of the selfish boss.  We need small team-leaders, each trying to succeed in their small domain, but they have to stay small or the dynamics get messed up. Chapter 10 addresses the paradox of the boss who wants to 'reform' the company, but protect his perks.  Chapters 11 and 12 suggest solutions to these conundrums of selfishness: markets and elections.e concern for 'well-being' is a source of 'group-think' and 'no changes allowed' attitudes.   <br /> <br />Though Surowiecki might disagree, much of the remaining material tries to make sense of self-interest.

The energy required can be measured in terms of granola bars.<br /><br />I'm sorry: work is work.  But, this curious enthusiasm for returning to nature is just a frill. The book has a lot of useful details on foundations, walls, and finish materials.  It never gets past the introductory level, but all the key points are covered.  Additionally, there is good coverage of design issues, with particular emphasis on avoiding water damage. Finishing walls is given 3 chapters: natural finishes, lime finishes, and gypsum finishes.<br /><br />I was a bit disappointed in the lack of interest in power-tools, but getting one's hands muddy seems like too much fun to the authors.  Additionally, more details on chemistry would have been helpful.  At a certain level, I suspect this book is a good introductory lesson for volunteers assembling at a worksite with at least one master builder on hand.  Working with mud may be fun, but it takes a large crew to get the whole house, barn or commune done in a single building season.	2005-02-05

The title and first 10 pages of this book are great. Unfortunately, the task of integrating these principles was beyond the ability of the authors.  The 'rest of the book' doesn't really rise above a traditional 'gardening in suburban Austin, Texas.'<br /><br />The seven principles of Xeriscaping are:<br />1. Plan to use your micro-climate instead of eradicating it.<br />2. Find out what kind of soil exists on the site.<br />3. Select plants that take advantage of your soil.<br />4. Limit or exclude turf areas unless you get 50+ inches of rain per year.<br />5. Create irrigation systems which conserves water and maximize the benefits of what gets used.<br />6. Use mulch to retain moisture.<br />7. Minimize use of pesticides and chemical fertilizers.<br /><br />These 7 items become chapter headings for the rest of the book. Several of these chapters can stand alone: soil analysis, efficient irrigation systems, minimal use of chemicals and using mulch.  The other three, planning for your micro-climate, finding plants suitable for your soil and micro-climate and using appropriate turf require an integrated view. Unfortunately, he authors of each chapter seem to focus on their subject and ignore the other 6 principles.  The chapter on planning ignores any discussion of microclimate.  The chapter on soil analysis offers no guide for self-testing or getting with a lab.  The chapter on plant selection never mentions micro-climate or soil type.  The chapter on turf does little more than promote the use of turf irrespective of micro-climate.<br /><br />Publication of a good Xeriscaping book for the diverse micro-climates and soil types of Central Texas remains an often discussed but illusive goal.	2005-01-22

On the surface, it looks like an attempt to convince US voters that 9/11 was just the beginning of their problems. Quoting bin Laden 'videos', Williams convincingly claims Osama bin Laden wants non-Muslims dead and has nuclear bombs to accomplish that goal. The fear factor is very high.<br /><br />After more reflection, the book reminds me of a blackmail note. Just as a blackmailer, Williams attacks the American reader's self-confidence at every opportunity. Mr. bin Laden is super-human, while the American government weak and corrupt. Osama knows all our weaknesses, and solves problems beyond our skills. For the poor people of Afghanistan, he build hospitals, roads and shelters. He sells heroin to Europe and America, but his puritanical comrades avoid the stuff themselves. The Afghan heroin funds his nuclear projects and simultaneously undermines the western will. In contrast, the stupid American generals run up and down the mountain sides looking for Osama in all the wrong places. The corrupt US government has turned Pakistani and Afghan friendship into a deep seated hate for all things American. Defended by the billions of Osama loving Muslims around the world, it is obvious the US Army can never catch him. Offering the reader a measure of pity, Williams provides instructions on converting to Islam.<br /><br />This sort of paper thin caricature does nothing to educate and much to demoralize.<br /><br />It is probably best to act as if Osama has nukes in America, but I don't think it is a reality. Osama's nuclear attack is only believable if 1) the bombs were available for purchase, 2) are now in the US and 3) still work. Even with the plutonium, obtaining active tritium gas would be very difficult. Keeping them refreshed with tritium gas is not easy; it leaks, gets absorbed and decays. Still a few fresh ones may be around. On the other hand, a variety of reports suggest similar economic damage can be done with a few suicide bombs set off at key gas and electrical nodes around the US. If one wants to catalog the catastrophic, nuclear briefcases are not the worst or most likely. In short, Osama doesn't need a nuke, except perhaps for the media carnival that would follow. And, the media would make a killing on the event. Imagine the network anchors crawling around the rubble and think about how long they would smirk about the disaster.<br /><br />As I write in early 2005, the panic over Osama-nukes is about a year old, and has faded from the foreground of media coverage. That panic, probably part of the US political campaign cycle, is the source from which the book emerges. Wondering who Mr. Williams might be and what motivates him, I checked for other titles he has penned:<br /><br />The Vatican Exposed: Money, Murder, and the Mafia (May 1, 2003)<br /><br />Al-Qaeda : Brotherhood of Terror (February 8, 2002)<br /><br />The Complete Idiot's Guide(R) to the Crusades (October 18, 2001)<br /><br />The Complete Idiot's Guide to the Lives of the Saints (June 26, 2001)<br /><br />Mr. Williams has a Ph.D. in historical theology and served as professor of Catholic theology and patristics (study of lives of Church Fathers) at two Catholic Universities. Despite the dust-cover claims, this isn't really the background of a journalist or FBI consultant. Perhaps the stress of writing 'lives of the saints' for 'idiots' was too much for him.one with a few suicide bombs set off at key gas and electrical nodes around the US.

Imagine the network anchors crawling around the rubble and think about how long they would smirk about the disaster. <br /> <br />As I write in early 2005, the panic over Osama-nukes is about a year old, and has faded from the foreground of media coverage. That panic, probably part of the US political campaign cycle, is the source from which the book emerges. Wondering who Mr. Williams might be and what motivates him, I checked for other titles he has penned: <br />The Vatican Exposed: Money, Murder, and the Mafia (May 1, 2003)  <br />Al-Qaeda : Brotherhood of Terror (February 8, 2002) <br />The Complete Idiot's Guide(R) to the Crusades (October 18, 2001) <br />The Complete Idiot's Guide to the Lives of the Saints (June 26, 2001)  <br /> <br />Mr. Williams has a Ph.D. in historical theology and served as professor of Catholic theology and patristics (study of lives of Church Fathers) at two Catholic Universities. Despite the dust-cover claims, this isn't really the background of a journalist or FBI consultant. Perhaps the stress of writing 'lives of the saints' for 'idiots' was too much for him.	2005-01-20

Unfortunately, it wasn't the sort of meditation on botany that I enjoy.  Despite my reaction, it is obviously satisfying many readers.  I find this more interesting than the text.<br /><br />My problems begin on paragraph 3:<br /><br />\\"A bumblebee would probably consider himself as a subject in the garden and the bloom he's plundering for its drop of nectar as an object.  But we know that this is just a failure of his imagination. The truth of the matter is that the flower has cleverly manipulated the bee into hauling its pollen from blossom to blossom.\\"<br /><br />This is a twist on Dawkins' famous 'selfish gene' argument.  Dawkins argues that you and I represent vehicles our genes have created to insure their 'survival'.  Our genes have provided us with plenty of mindless passions which insure the gene's survival, not ours.  We, the vehicles, emerge, reproduce and die.  The genetic matter is passed on from generation to generation.  The gene is immortal.<br /><br />When Pollan elevates the flower to 'conscious subject', capable of tricking the bumblebee into heavy labor, he does for the flower what Dawkins did for the gene.  The site of conscious control transfers from the active to the passive, from the traditional to the surprising, from you and I to 'it'. This metaphorical trick uses a familiar metaphorical allusion which suggests 'consciousness' has physical location, and within that location resides a 'little man' (much like you or I), who watches something of a TV show presented by the senses, before deciding what actions to take.<br /><br />For idol worshipers, like the ancient Greeks, the 'little man' Dionysus might reside in the statue.  For Descartes, the 'little man'  was in the pineal gland.  For Mary Shelly, he was in the brain Dr. Frankenstein stitched into the monster's head.  For Dawkins he is in the gene.  For Pollan, he is in the flower. The common thread here is the shift of responsibility from 'me' to the 'little man'.  It is comforting, as long as we don't look too closely at the notion.  When we look closely, the little man argument becomes silly.  A 'little man' must have his own 'little man', which in turn must have his own 'little man', ad infinitum.  Nothing about the nature of responsibility is addressed.<br /><br />Pollan follows this format.  We are told about the powerful genetic (little man) creativity of the original apple grove in Kazakhstan.  We are informed of Johnny Appleseed's link to the Dionysian god-head. We learn about profiteer efforts to contain the life force (little men) of tulips of fixed shape, size and color.  The `little men' in marijuana plants allow their growers to out-fox the government agents. So, Pollan is really doing nothing but offering comforting nostrums and hoping no one looks very closely.shift of responsibility from 'me' to the 'little man'.

Unfortunately, it doesn't really fly.  While there still may be merit in study of Einstein's educational comments to children, this volume doesn't offer much insight.<br /><br />The book starts with Einstein's grand daughter's recollections of grandpa, then her personal bio of Einstein, then another two mini-bio's by 3rd parties and a bunch of Einstein photos.  Finally, we get to the letters, but 'Einstein' only replies to about 1 of 5 letters.  Maybe this is enough if Einstein had addressed actually addressed the issues, but they generally offer polite parental advice: study hard and hope for the best.<br /><br />A few answers might give us a peak into Einstein's metaphysics, but the author doesn't explore them.  For example, one child asks if scientists pray.  Einstein answers that A) Scientist know prayer cannot influence the laws of physics, so they don't pray. B) But, scientists know their knowledge is limited, so C) they realize God might work in a restricted domain.  D) This means scientists have a very special relationship with God.  Left unsaid was the less than politically correct D) So, scientists still pray.	2004-12-27

His work is generally considered part of the 'constructivist' school of psychology, which seeks to correct various failings in the standard American philosophy of mind: behaviorism. For the behaviorist, scientist can only discuss measurable and repeatable phenomena.  'Anecdotal' stories are explicitly disqualified, with particular emphasis on 'privileged insight' of our own 'self'.  This leads to a favorite constructivist joke about behaviorists, which Gardener quotes early in the book: \\"So the two behaviorists had just finished making love, and the first one turns to the other, and says, 'It was good for you, was it good for me?'\\"<br /><br />Constructivism seeks to remove the straightjacket behaviorism imposes on scientific dialog. It holds that learners impose meaning on the world, and so \\"construct\\" their own understanding based on their unique experiences. I mention this to put 'Changing Minds' in context. Constructivism is far from 'accepted' among academics or the general population. Despite Gardner's claims to the contrary, most academics would argue his theories are non-scientific, anecdotal gobbly-gook. He fails to obey the behaviorist dogma about relying on probability and measurable phenomena, and should not be allowed any voice in 'scientific academia'. Without this backdrop of academic controversy, the book's message will seem oddly out of balance. Gardner's themes don't really emerge naturally for the reader. This occurs because his arguments are designed to address an academic milieu the general reader will not know.<br /><br />Gardener sidesteps the academic debates by addressing the needs of educators rather than psychologists. According to Gardner, the school is an environment for 'changing minds'.  This is going to sound a bit odd to most, since most would argue school is for 'imparting truths' upon the 'blank slates' of student minds.  It isn't a matter of 'changing minds', but putting something there in the first place. Though strange to see this material presented as 'business literature', the emphasis on education over 'theory' provides Gardner an escape from academic nihilism.<br /><br />Changing the minds of students involves engaging the ideas occupying student attention and reshaping them to more closely approximate some goal. For Gardner, 4 classes of 'ideas' can be distinguished:<br />A. Concepts: the elementary units of logic. The notion 'dog' is a concept.<br />B. Stories: the narrative flow of conceptual units producing emotional response. For example, the feeling 'I understand' is an emotional response to a good story.<br />C. Theories: Stories, when generalized, become theories<br />D. Skills: Phenomena the 'self' or 'mind' can generate via an activating sequence of bodily motions.<br /><br />The process of 'molding' involves 'representational redescription' of their attention.  Gardner comes back to this theme over and over, again.  Change can only take place when the representational models take new forms.  This requires the 'change agent' (teacher) to engage the student in a process of tearing up the existing model and reconstructing it in a new form.  This produces new theories about how the world works.  These efforts are aided by 'resonance', an emotional experience reinforcing the 'new model'.  They are inhibited by 'resistance', or attachments to the old models.  Additionally, the teacher must be prepared for either abrupt or gradual change.  Gardner unfortunately ignores the mental mechanics of 'changing minds', but he is quite willing to acknowledge it takes its own pace. The slow is just as effective as the fast.<br /><br />Gardener argues there are 7 factors (levers).  Each must be considered when the 'change agent' (teacher) designs the process of tearing up the old model and reconstructing something different.<br />1. Reason-the act of logical inspection<br />2. Research-the act of study<br />3. Resonance-the experience of 'understanding'<br />4. Representational redescriptions: with out the images. Nothing happens<br />5. Resources and rewards<br />6. Real world event<br />7. Resistance-persistent images which the audience is attached to<br /><br />Additionally, the change agent must consider the social setting.<br />A.  Is his presentation 'face to face' or indirect?<br />B.  Is the presentation directed at a homogeneous audience, or one with significant disagreements?<br />C. Someone else, or the change agent themselves?<br /><br />With this in mind, Gardner generalizes the realm of 'politics' as one where 'the change audience' is approached 'directly', the audience is diverse and the focus 'external' to the agent.  On the other hand, a doctor's approach is direct; the audience has one frame of mind and is 'external' to the agent.  In contrast, a scientist changes minds indirectly via his publications.<br /><br />Finally, Gardner suggests being aware of the audience's initial state of mind.  In some cases this is a matter of expectations, but other times the 'initial state' is a function of recent events. For example, at the start of the ideal class, the 'students' are all alert, well fed and eager to understand the teacher's logical presentation.  The reality is that many students will be dealing with fear, distrust, dislikes, pain, language differences and disinterest.<br /><br /> After making some rather futile attempts to illustrate these ideas with 'the lives of famous people', Gardner offers a token plan: Before launching into a change program, answer the following questions:<br />1. What is the redescriptional goal:  Do you want to 'redescribe' a concept? a story? a skill?<br />2. Who is your audience? Are they diverse?<br />3. What is your relationship with the audience?<br />4. What impact will the 'change plan' have on audience?<br />5. Which of the 7 factors (levers) is most important?<br />6. Is the change ethical? Is the world better off after the change has been made?<br /><br />This above plan relies heavily on Neuro-Linguistic Programming (NLP), a program widely derided by academics.  In particular, the standard NLP question 'is the change ethical' represents something of a logical land mine for this somewhat academic presentation.  Entire books are devoted to this topic.<br /><br />Overall, 'Changing Minds' suffers an inability to focus on a straightforward message.  Despite this, the suggestions are more than worthy of your attention.  The book is well worth the effort required to tease out some meaning.t of study  3.

US	52485851	R13H879PN7YJMX	0895261480	815056968	Breakdown: How America's Intelligence Failures Led to September 11	Books	3	4	10	N	N	The sum is less than the parts	A few days before writing this, Congress approved the 'Intelligence Reform Act of 2004'.  I thought this book might be useful for understanding the exceptionally difficult issues involved.  Unfortunately, it only covers the preliminary ground work.<br /><br />Unless you have been living in a cave for the last 5  years, you are well aware that Congress, the FBI, the CIA and the NSA (and thus the President of the United States) had a variety of warnings which could have prevented the September 11, 2001 attacks on New York and Washington, DC.  This book reviews the warnings, using a chapter for each agency, the Congress and the Presidency.<br /><br />While interesting, these reviews are poor narratives.  The story line becomes very familiar, 1) agent 'X' was suspicious of 'Y' and wrote a 'warning memo'.  2) Unfortunately, a Democratic party functionary was running the agent's office and hid the warning.  3) If one looks into the office politics, it becomes obvious that the Democratic party functionaries were uninterested in Muslim terrorists.  Instead, they favored activites that protected bureaucratic positions, maintained elected office, expanded a social service or played to the 'we hate the US military' crowd.<br /><br />While interesting, the stories fail to argue for any general understanding of bureaucratic dynamics, the mind of Muslim terrorists or US politics.  It is useful to know the specifics of various available warnings, but the simple moral tales were unconvincing.  As a whole, the details are just details.  The sum is less than the parts.  In particular, there is no balance-of-powers governmental principle elucidated. Balance-of-power is the bedrock of US politics.<br /><br />After these reviews, a set of recommendations were offered.<br />1. New clandestine service replacing CIA directorate of Operations and DIA Defense HUMINT. The goal is to create a service that relies on American diversity to place Americans in the front lines of intelligence collection.<br />2. Create a new Counter intelligence service outside the FBI.<br />3. Abolish the DIA and return its responsibilities to the Military.<br />4. Have CIA redesigned to support military.<br />5. Set up small Military 'special ops' force.<br />6. Upgrade technical abilities for collecting intel.<br /><br />Two of these are non-controversial: #1 and #6, largely because they are so vague.  Who would be against gritty 'real world' spies with technology James Bond would be proud  to use?  #3, #4, and #5 argue for giving more of the intelligence role to military officers, but the book has not made a case for trusting the military over 'spy bureaucrats', only against Democratic functionaries running spy agencies.  #2 is the traditional 'new bureaucracy' temptation solution, which is as empty as #1 and #6.  Thus, we are left with a simple analysis: turn counter terrorism over to the Army, Navy and Air Force.<br /><br />Gertz and I probably agree that the Carter and Clinton administrations represent 20th century low points in US foreign policy, but the arguments and recommendations need to stand on their own merits.  On their own, the case makes no sense.  This probably explains the irrelevance of the book when used to inform opinion regarding the 2004 Intell Reform Act.  The public debate over this measure revolved around two issues:<br />1. National driver's license standards<br />2. Congressional vs. Executive authority over 'real time' field level surveillance satellites.<br /><br />The book makes no issue of driver license standards, nor the immigration issues that confuse the debate.  The second issue is a 'balance of congressional and executive power' question, which the book never addresses.<br /><br />In conclusion, while useful for summarizing the pre-9/11 warnings, the book is useless for making sense of 'how intel failed' and allowed 9/11 to take place.  Since no theory of bureaucratic politics is offered, we end up with little more than 'my politics arebetter than yours' and  'another layer of bureaucracy will solve everything'.	2004-12-15

Don't believe the outward appearances, he argues. Instead, look at the track record and determine for yourself what Hillary Clinton would do as president.<br /><br />The first six of 14 chapters address actions taken by Hillary in 2003 which might be interpreted as 'campaigning' for the presidency.  At the end of Chapter 6, we get told her candidacy is probable.  Of course, this didn't turn out to be what happened.<br /><br />With Chapter 7, Limbacher begins to make a case that the 'scheme' is not limited to just the 2004 election. To accomplish this, he tries to make a character study of the former First Lady. First of all, she is always angry. This anger seems to get away from her at times, and emerges as exceptionally rude racial comments that would ruin the career of normal mortals. Second, she channels this anger into 'constant campaigning'.  Third, she has been aiming at the Presidency since at least 1992.  The 'scheme' isn't just something for the 2004 election; the scheme has probably been in place for 20 years.<br /><br />The continuous campaign makes pretty interesting reading.  At Yale, she championed Black Panthers who were eventually convicted for torturing and murdering a fellow Black Panther.  She then moved on to the Nixon Watergate circus, and then to Bill Clinton's electoral campaigns.  If all this wasn't enough work, she had to silence the countless women seduced, entrapped or raped by Bill Clinton. Limbacher argues that her record of hiring and supervising private investigators shows exceptional talent. Along these lines, Limbacher makes some fairly well substantiated claims that this remarkable talent was used to instigate IRS audits against Bill Clinton's political opponents during her years as First lady.<br /><br />In fact, this role as 'Protector of Bill' is Limbacher's best argument for raising red flags about Hillary Clinton and her Presidential ambitions. He starts by arguing that Bill Clinton was and is a sexual predator.  In the court of public opinion, he is guilty of at least one rape (Ms. Juanita Broderick).  Limbacher than asserts Hillary was the key individual protecting Bill from spending time in jail, as the average sex offender would do.  Thus, Hillary is culpable for subjecting Bill's staff to the rapes and abuse it suffered.  Casting Hillary as 'rapist enabler' provides the 'proof' to Limbacher's title: Hillary's Scheme.<br /><br />There is nothing on her policies as Senator, or campaigning points for the 2004/2008 presidential campaign.<br /><br />The author, Limbacher works for NewsMax, a web-based conservative media outlet.<br /><br />The book is more than a little dated now that the 2004 election is over.  It is an easy read, though.  The arguments address a 20 year campaign and not 'just' the 2004 election.  Limbacher is preaching to the converted, and doesn't do much to address the bipolar reaction to Hillary one sees among the general voting public.  The logic, if I have identified it correctly, could be better presented. It is a campaign book and has a breathless quality, but it really isn't about the campaign.  Additionally, it makes few predictions.  It doesn't go out on a limb and say 'watch for this...' As Hillary's 2008 campaign unfolds, it will be hard to determine if Limbacher was right or wrong.Bill Clinton was and is a sexual predator.

As I will explain at length in Chapter 1, by the \\"historical Jesus\\" I mean the Jesus whom we can recover, recapture, or reconstruct by using the scientific tools of modern historical research.\\"  In paragraph 2, he outlines his technique for adjudicating the 'scientific evidence': \\"I often use the fantasy of the 'unpapal conclave.' Suppose that a Catholic, a Protestant, a Jew, and an agnostic - all honest historians cognizant of 1st century religious movements - were locked up ... and not allowed to emerge until they had hammered out a consensus document on who Jesus of Nazareth was and what he intended in his own time and place.\\"<br /><br />Unfortunately, the 'conclave' is entirely in his imagination and he never elaborates on 'the scientific tools of modern historical research'.<br /><br />With respect to the conclave, it is useful to put 'A Marginal Jew' in context. It was released to the public on Nov, 1, 1991.  It is safe to assume the above was written down sometime in the late 80s.  A few years earlier (1985), the 'fantasy conclave' had actually been realized.  That conclave, now known as the Jesus Seminar, was several hundred scholars and they worked for several years on the project Meier outlines.  Given the size of the Jesus Seminar, it is certain Meier knew of its activities.<br /><br />In other words, Meier's 'unpapal conference' was actually taking place and Meier chose not to engage it directly.  This book should be seen as a 'minority brief.' Of course, the Jesus Seminar is often vilified, so 'minority' or 'majority' is a matter of debate.  He got his brief out 2 years before the Jesus Seminar's 'The Five Gospels', but an adequate rebuttal (if one can be made) will require another author.<br /><br />While Meier alludes to 'scientific historigrahy', he doesn't inform the reader on the subject.  By ignoring this, he makes a major mistake.  The 'majority report' issued by the Jesus Seminar relies almost entirely upon textual deconstruction, the process of deducing hidden meaning via unexpected juxtaposition of a given textual record.  While debatable as a science, no one can deny the computer has given us the ability to statistically analyze text for word usage patterns far exceeding anything available to pre 20th century scholars.  This 'modern science' is use to great effect by the Jesus Seminar, but Meier seems incapable of dealing with it.<br /><br />Faced with the juggernaut of the non-fantasy conclave's computerized textual deconstruction, Meier falls back upon traditional historiographic methods.  He cites earlier publications and his favorite scholars.  On an objective level, Meier cannot make a dent in the Jesus Seminar claims.  In the end, Meier is relying on 'old fashion' textual decomposition.  His arguments fall flat for all but the reader already confirmed in his opinion.<br /><br />With this in mind, what does Meier argue?  Let me outline this by describing the difference between the Jesus Seminar and Meier understandings of 'The Gospel of Thomas'. The methodology of the Jesus Seminar follows the process outlined on page one of 'A Marginal Jew'. Using textual decomposition to cross compare every 'Jesus quote' in the 4 Canonic gospels and Thomas with one another, they report the results of a 'vote on the Jesus quote' by the conclave.  The results of these votes show a majority of scholars believe Thomas includes authentic and unique Jesus quotes.<br /><br />In contrast, Meier argues that Thomas can be dismissed from consideration for the following reasons:<br /><br />A. Thomas is heretical, so we cannot trust the redactor to preserve 'true' Jesus quotes.<br />B. Some scholars have concluded a few Jesus quotes in Thomas are derivations from Luke and Matthew, so we have no evidence the Thomas Jesus quotes are 'original'.<br />C. It would bore the reader review 1st/2nd century Jewishand non-canonic texts, A and B above are adequate.<br /><br />The first argument can be construed to be the point of the book and I doubt it can be used to justify use or disuse of possible evidence.  The second has been entirely undermined by the Jesus Seminar.  The third may be boring, but represents the only logical research path.

It was awe inspiring and I've never forgotten the experience.  I was hoping this little book would help me understand the experiment and my reaction.  In both cases, the book was only partially successful.<br /><br />At a scientific level, the book is a failure.  Don't expect to learn any physics, or even improve your understanding of pendulums.<br /><br />At the level of 'history of science', the book is a mixed bag.  The history is anecdotal, reminding me of a 'grand-tour' of 2nd Empire celebrities.  Sprinkled in, one will find a second 'grand-tour' of flat-earth debates.  Some of these anecdotes are hilarious.  Unfortunately, you won't find much insight into the practice of 19th century science or Foucault's mind.  The external details are of considerable interest, though.

Mark 12:28 (pink)	I have to admit I liked this book a great deal. It was very thought provoking, and that is what I wanted.<br /><br />As anyone can note from the title, this is an attempt to add a new gospel to the canonic testaments of Matthew, Mark, Luke and John.  Without saying as much, the book seeks to raise the standing of a newly discovered ancient 'book': 'the Gospel of Thomas'.  The 1945 discovery of 'Thomas', a previously unknown gospel of about the same antiquity as the canonic gospels, demands a reassessment of the traditional canon.  Some might say this reassessment is the job of scholars, and has already been accomplished with a dismissal of Thomas as derivative and heretical.  This book presents an extensive argument against this conclusion, and makes it in an accessible manner for the lay reader,<br /><br />The format of Thomas presents a significant problem.  Thomas is not a narrative, but a list of 114 'sayings'. Thomas tells many of the canonic parables, but the Thomas versions are shorter and often bereft of any moral interpretation.  10 or 15 sound very much like 'Jesus', but are entirely missing from the canon.  Many of the remaining 50 or so sayings invoke what scholars might call 'Gnostic' philosophy.  Thomas fails to mention the resurrection story and includes only one mention of 'the cross.'<br /><br />Fitting Thomas into any holistic understanding of Jesus will not be easy.  In particular, a 'list of sayings' is far harder to trust than a coherent narrative.  It is far easier for the man writing a copy to insert their opinions when no 'statement' need continue a thought from the prior paragraph.<br /><br />Without making integration of Thomas into the canonic literature an overt goal, the 'Jesus seminar' simply sets out to see how much trouble one faces when applying a single standard to the four canonic gospels AND Thomas.  The Jesus Seminar concludes Thomas is far more authentic than John.<br /><br />The '5 Gospels' reports on this process leading to this conclusion.  The 'conference' assumes one can deconstruct the 'real' voice of the historical Jesus by cross-referencing all available 'Jesus quotes' in the 5 documents.  What we are going to do with the historic Jesus is politely avoided, but the clear assumption is the 'real' is good.<br /><br />I had no idea how subtle a notion this goal turns out to be.  By sticking strictly to the nominal goal: 'hear the historical Jesus speaking', a host of controversies can be sidestepped.  The agnostic and atheist can 'hear' the historical Jesus.  The same follows for the Christian, Jew, Muslim, Hindu or Buddhist.  All hear people talk through written texts.  All can relate to the question, do a historical man's actual words speak through the evangelist (be they an individual or a community) and the host of people who copied the source prior to 'canonical' versions were provided institutional copy producing traditions.<br /><br />This is also a 'lowest common denominator' strategy. While reading, it struck me this was a very 'safe' Jesus that the seminar could agree upon.  The conventionality gets tiresome.  It seems the 'safe' Jesus is a witty hippy sort of guy.  Here are the 'top 5' (and I paraphrase):<br />1. Turn the other cheek (92% agreement)<br />2. If someone asks for your shirts, give him your coat, too (92% agreement)<br />3. Blessed are the poor (91%)<br />4. If someone asks you to carry his load for 1 mile, carry it for 2. (90%)<br />5. Love your enemies (84%)<br /><br />Everything with the slightest aspect of mystery is dismissed.<br />1. He didn't use the 1st person pronoun \\"I\\", and if he did, it was in exactly the same unimportant way you or I use it.  In other words, Jesus never said 'I am the light...\\"  This entirely discounts the Jesus quotes in John.<br />2. He didn't talk about a cataclysmic end to the world as we know it.<br />3. He didn't talk about his death and resurrection, or the Solomon's temple being dismantled.<br />4. If he did say anything after the resurrection, no one wrote it down accurately.<br /><br />The seminar simply didn't agree on the mysteries, and who should expect them?  Given their backgrounds, at least 25% of the seminar were agnostic or atheist.<br /><br />While reading the scholarly arguments, I wondered if I could authentically quote anything my wife has ever said.  I'm sure she said 'I do' at some point, but would be hard pressed to 'quote' a story or piece of wisdom she has shared with me. It isn't for lack of listening!  It is almost impossible to remember exactly what anyone said without making a point of writing it down 'in the moment'.<br /><br />And, if it is written down, the individual units of text are always commonplace.  I was often reminded of an old Victor Borge routine.  The great pianist would stop playing a wonder Mozart piece and announce he had in his pocket a piece of paper with the first 'note' Mozart ever wrote.  After carefully pulling it from his pocket and lovingly discussing it's history, he announces that he also has a scrap of paper with the last 'note' Mozart ever wrote.  After retrieving this precious document, he looks at the two and says, 'Interesting, the first note as a 'C' and the last a 'D'.  Mozart didn't get very far, did he?'<br /><br />So there is the problem of trusting that someone got it written down fast enough combined with the fact all sentences are constructed of commonplace words.  The two make textual deconstruction of 'original words' a speculative game. Old quotes might be worthless paraphrasing or outright fantasy.  Alternatively, old quotes always reflect the commonplace phrases of a community, devoid of individual character.  What we find important is the 'whole picture'.<br /><br />So, nothing is really proven here.  The authors carefully avoid the 'whole picture', suggesting everyone work that out on their own.  I found it possible to suspend judgment long enough to get through all 5 'critiqued' gospels, but it was a bit of a struggle. I'm glad I kept pushing to get to the end.

I failed to agree with the author's conclusions, but doubt the intent was to convince.  She shares her own meditations, but they are inspirational comments rather than legal epitaphs.<br /><br />The book starts with a review of contemporary treatment of the icon 'Mary Magdalene'.  We make a pilgrimage to a church dedicated to her and experience the emotions her passion play evokes.  This image is then undermined by reviewing the history of Mary Magdalene's persona as described by church fathers over the last 1800 years.<br /><br />De Boer then goes beyond the church fathers to the earliest evangelical quotes attributed to Mary herself: The Gospel of Mary Magdalene.  While the document is at least 1500 years old, it isn't clear what it represents: does it quote the words Mary spoke or is it simply another 'myth' about Mary.<br /><br />De Boer spends a good deal of time addressing the problem of differentiating the three personas attributed to Mary:<br /><br />1. Mary, the follower of Jesus presented in the canonic gospels,<br /><br />2. Mary, the priestess of Christ as presented in the Gospel of Mary Magdalene,<br /><br />3. Mary, the 'reformed prostitute' as presented by medieval European church fathers.<br /><br />In the end, De Boer concludes the 'real' Mary was accurately quoted in the Gospel of Mary Magdalene.	2004-09-29

The book is far too short for a serious commentary, and far to disorganized to motivate further reading and/or reflection.<br /><br />The first chapter provides a useful historical narrative from the Turkish perspective, one that many American readers will find a bit uncomfortable.  Unfortunately, the edge quickly evaporates into familiar ivory-tower contemplation, one that ignores the issues that attract potential readers.<br /><br />As best I can tell, Lewis believes the French Revolution represents a 4th great revelation.  The first was given to Moses, the second to Christ, the third to Mohammed, and the fourth found its voice in the French Revolution's cry for 'Liberty, Equality, and Fraternity.'  Lewis wanders about wondering why Muslims are so reticent to abandon their myths and incomplete revelation.  The chapter on clocks and measurements could have been called 'why doesn't the metric system make good Europeans out of the Middle East'.  Perhaps Lewis believes the repetition of familiar French slogans is the equivalent of saying 'God is Great!'<br /><br />None of this will help one understand current affairs in Turkey, Iran, Iraq, Egypt, Pakistan or Indonesia.  It may help understand the peculiar French perspective on things Islamic, though.<br /><br />A much better accounting for current events can be found in Jonathan Bloom's 'Paper before Print: the History and Impact of Paper in the Islamic World'.  Bloom, in contrast to Lewis, makes an art of seeing the links between rituals of 'social continuity' and a culture's response to adversity and/or opportunity.	2004-09-13

For those predisposed to find Satan emerging from human psychology, the book delivers. The scholarship is crisp and well documented.  The prose is clear and measured.  The outcome is never in doubt.<br />As Pagels sees it, there is nothing 'satanic' with independent existence in the world.  The notion of Satan is merely a misunderstanding that was amplified by human frailty. Thus, Pagels focuses on human paranoia, and the tendency of the paranoid to blame someone for their internal fears.<br />Specifically, Pagels argues the early Christians invoked fear of cosmic evil to demonize Jews and cozy up with Romans. Satan is later turned to personify evil in pagan form and finally explain the motives of the threatening non-Roman (or non-Roman Catholic).<br />Fundamental to Pagels argument is dating 'publication' of the gospels.  These dates are presented as 'facts' when they are still topics of intense debate. Pagels never lets us know her reasons for selecting the dates she uses.  The issue is treated as too technical for the reader.  Additionally, Pagels invokes the notion of literary evolution, as if 'books' evolve.  'Mark' was rewritten as 'Matthew' and 'Luke.'  'Matthew' and 'Luke' were rewritten as 'John'. All this presupposes a sort of 20th century publication system, with an elite cabal controlling the printing press (the scriptorium?), honing the party (papal) 'line' year by year. It is too simple an answer for me.  Maybe 'John' is a revision of 'Luke', but there isn't any academic consensus for this conclusion.  It is just a conspiracy theory, and ignores what should be the book's focus: what is the nature of evil and do the Christian traditions offer us any insights on the subject.<br />While reading, I was reminded of the international literati's vilification of Mel Gibson's 'The Passion of the Christ'. Pagels' arguments are the same curious arguments.	2004-07-18

On the most factual of levels, the number of murders described is mind-numbing.  The primary villains of the book each murdered around 200 men, women and children.<br />Even more disturbing is the popularity these man-eaters enjoy. Their victims are too easily dismissed as ethnic outsiders, people who didn't count or should have escaped to another land.<br />Finally, people living today in North Texas can recount hearing the man-eaters themselves bragging about their exploits, and they exhibit no revulsion.  I mentioned the book to a long time resident of North Texas, in hopes of getting a 'it couldn't happen here' reaction. Instead, I got a wistful tale about a childhood encounter with the outlaws Bonnie and Clyde.<br />The book recounts a microcosm of the 'second civil war', the war which returned vanquished Dixie to the control of the antebellum slave-masters.  Specifically, it tells of the struggle between the North Texas unionist Lewis Peacock and his slave-master neighbor, Bob Lee.  Peacock wins the battle with Lee, but loses the war and his life.<br />The details are chilling.  Lewis Peacock is simply a man of principle and one has to wonder why he was so careless with his life.  In short he foolishly fights the ethics of slavery.  As Bob Lee put it, &quot;I'll kill any [...] that won't tip his hat at me.&quot;  Bob Lee and his pals (including John Wesley Hardin) go out of their way to perform this 'hat tipping' test, fulfilling his promise with stunning immediacy.  Lee's threat carried the additional warning.  Anyone interfering with his experiments in social order could expect to die.  As Bob is quoted, speaking to a unionist he had just mortally wounded, &quot;it's nothing personal, Bill&quot;.  After pulverizing Lewis Peacock with 6 shotgun blasts at close range, the man-eaters leisurely visited the town under-taker and said 'Hello, Hello, in there! Parson Gent, you can go and dress the fowl.  We've killed it.&quot;  Additionally, there is the tale of a 16 year old killing a boyhood friend visiting to take his sister on a date.  The old friend had unwisely turned unionist.  In another tale, nephew murders uncle.  The uncle had joined the posse that chased down Bob Lee.  In his defence, the young man confided 'he drew first, but I was faster'.<br />This is a must read for anyone who fancies they understand Dixie, and the wild, wild west..

Seeking to understand their relationship is worth the effort. This book will not help, though.  Read this book only for cautionary purposes.<br />This is not a scholarly book. It tries to do many thing, but fails to penetrate deeply into any.  For a better encounter with mystic grail followers, see Umberto Eco's &quot;Foucault's Pendulum&quot;.  Much more challenging, but it will stick with you a lot longer.  For the juice on fertility rites, see Joseph Campbell's &quot;The King and the Corpse&quot;.  To meet Mary herself, see LeLoup's &quot;The Gospel of Mary Magdalene&quot;.<br />Starbird describes Mary Magdalene as a rather inert object of Christ's libidinal passions.  Mary never speaks directly in this book.  She acts as sublime priestess of matrimonial ritual, but she only acts out the dance others created.  She carries/nurtures the seed of Christ, but whatever that involved, StarBird never personalizes.  In the end, we are left with something of an argument for divine-right political legitimacy.  The patrimony of David is highly exalted here.<br />Rather than illuminating anything Jesus or Mary Magdalene said while walking this earth, as lovers or otherwise, Starbird shoehorns the couple into the mold of ancient Egyptian and Babylonian magic.  Starbird keeps her two lovers silent.  It is much easier to keep the revolutionaries under control that way.  Starbird is advocating the most conservative of views: Let us return to the rites of the Pharohs, all that was important was known to them.  Reports of newer insights are merely mirage.	2004-07-10

It suggests the European Renaissance is related to declines in a commodity cost (writing material), rather than the birth of now-familiar geniuses and renewed interest in ancient classics. While the scope of the book outlines a complete history of 'cellulose pulp using people' (paper users), the central theme addresses the cultural transmission of technology.  Specifically, it describes the transmission of paper making skills  from China to Europe via the Muslim Caliphates.  Most of the narrative covers the period between 700 and 1200 AD, but ancient and modern detours intrude regularly.  This is entirely appropriate, since most readers will have a difficult time giving credence to commodity prices playing any role in European intellectual development.  Bloom seems to have decided to zig-zag back and forth across 3 thousand years of history, hoping to keep the 'big picture' in view.<br />The book makes an excellent argument for 'cultural' issues dictating technological change.  For example, paper emerged in China as a 'wrapping' material.  It wasn't until Buddhist influences from India made 'writing' important that it's utility as 'voice recording substrate' was discovered.  In other words, until the economic demands for precise and voluminous reproduction of Buddha's voice emerged, 'paper' was only used to bundle things together.  The combination of a cultural need (reproducing Buddha's voice) blended with a Chinese skill (making a cheap membrane that happened to soak up ink), what we know as the 'writing' industry never got off the ground.  Of real interest is the fact that India ignored the Chinese innovation for 2000 years.  Paper was not used frequently there until Muslim culture was imposed on it 2000 years later.<br />Since Bloom's perspective relies on continually falling paper prices for explaining cultural revolutions, the reader is presented with a sound foundation in the mechanics of paper production.  It is advances in these mechanical arts that drives down commodity prices.  Equally important are the mechanics of educating 'paper' users and stabilizing an infrastructure for the system's continued existence.  In this light, most of Bloom's time is spent describing educational and institutional practices of Muslim bureaucracy.  It seems this was a unique interaction between Mediterranean 'mystery writing' (Greek logic plus Jewish/Christian/Muslim truths) and the Chinese (via silk road) paper bureaucracy.  Bloom makes it clear that Muslim bureaucracy, and the paper using skills it relied upon, were invented by interaction of Middle East and China.  The new technology was not a revolutionary technology discovered when Muslims captured Chinese paper-makers during 8th century military exploits, instead the bureaucratic needs of Muslim authorities saw in 'silk road cellulose membranes' an means to 'better government' during a time when anachronism of Roman government bureaucracy made change (better government) a possibility.<br />With the expansion of Muslim bureaucracy around the southern half of the Mediterranean basin during the 8th and 9th centuries, paper production skills became available to Germanic peoples of Europe.  Unlike the Byzantines to the east, they were less attached to high priced writing membranes such as papyrus and vellum.  They showed far less resistance to changing manufacturing and institutional practices.  A good example of this is the 11th century 'corporate charter' revolution in Spain.  This bureaucratic revolution relied upon cheap paper for incorporating numerous Spanish towns into a cohesive military defense force against Muslims who brought the paper in the first place.  At the same time in Byzantium, the institutionalization of vellum record keeping practices retarded development of efficient government practices and an inability to address military threats from the Muslim east.<br />Bloom goes on to suggest that 3-D perspective as a communication skill emerged as a cultural force only when paper prices and reproduction costs fell to levels where 'mass readership' became possible.  Bloom locates this emerging phenomena in the 10th century Caliphates, where mass readership of the Koran was a cultural priority.  Bloom goes on to suggest that the Germanic peoples of Europe, who had no institutional focus on reproducing Koran-based beliefs, transmuted the phenomena of 'mass communication' into what we now know as the 'modern world'.n skill emerged as a cultural force only when paper prices and reproduction costs fell to levels where 'mass readership' became possible.

Rather than argue for or against any version of Darwins theories, Keynes describes the adventure of 2 English gentlemen setting out to create a better map of the world. Aside from providing an enjoyable and picturesque travel guide, we get to know the way each inspired the other.<br />The reader will be surprised to read about the daring young Darwin's adventures.  He ends up dodging warriors prowling the Argentinian praries, trusting his life to murderous Fuegian cowboys, getting drunk with Chilean gold miners, intervening in a Brazilian civil war and tasting potentially halucenogenic South American plants.<br />Keynes seems particularly interested in showing Darwin as Captain FitzRoy's agent and artist.  In some ways, Keynes makes a case that Darwin was hired to write the story FitzRoy dictated.  Like the artists brought along by Captain FitzRoy, Darwin was invited to embellishFitzRoy's maps.  FitzRoy, a flawed character of exceptional energy and intuition, knew well his limitations: depression and a violent temper.  To achieve what he knows is possible he drags young English gentlemen off to the ends of the world and sets them on their path to celebrity and fame.<br />Left to itself, this action story and tragedy (FitzRoy commits suicide in the last narrative chapter) could have stood alone.  The author feels compelled to trouble us with a search for the exact moment that Darwin's diary records the inspiration for 'evolutionary theory'.  It detracts a bit, but only in a minor way.  Unexplored is the relationship between map making and evolutionary trees, an obvious paradigm which would have fit the story better.	2004-05-07

It is not an easy book to read, so be forewarned.  It avoids many familiar assumptions about political distinctions, and relies on statistics more than narrative and drama.<br />Baum explores the idea that Texas, alone among the rebel states, might have rejoined the Union with a color-blind Republican administration.  Given American history, this is an outrageous hypothesis, but Baum makes a good case for his theory.<br />Baum starts with the surprising victory of pro-union Sam Houston in 1859.  This proves the existence, however tenuous, for a anti-planter or anti-slav-ocrat majority.  Given the outcome of the war, Baum ask why this pro-union majority didn't assert itself in 1870?<br />While this hypothesis may seem implausible, Baum does an extraordinary job of teasing contemporary opinion from a county by county review of voting patterns.  He looks at the available voting records, including the physical ballots, for every election between 1858 and 1869. Since few historians seem willing to go beyond summarizing contemporary newspaper articles, this provides a wonderful tonic.<br />Additionally, Baum calls upon records of the Freedmen's Bureau and military reports.  From these, Baum builds a compelling argument that grass-roots terrorism shaped each election after 1859, though not deciding the outcome in every case.  The terror was perpetrated by unreconstructed rebels, but Baum finds plenty of evidence that klan terror could be defeated. Though appalling, the reader is dragged through a county by county, election by election, tale of torture, lynching, and midnight murders.  It sounds dramatic, but isn't.  Baum fails to identify any moral response.  The few individuals willing to fight the Klan terror are quickly murdered or run out of the state.  Thus, it seems to lose its dramatic aspects.  It is simply a repetitious list of horrors.<br />Baum seems to argue that the issue of property redistribution polarized the elections after 1865.  The rumor of '40 acres and a mule' for every union veteran threatened yeoman farmer and slav-ocrat planter.  When Lee surrendered at Appomattox, there were about 200,000 southerners of color in the federal army.  Imagine the political process of handing over 8 million Southern acres to colored union veterans.<br />The history of terror and fraud within American democratic tradition needs to be better understood.  If nothing else, we might do a better job in Iraq.  Platitudes about democracy are hardly based on American history..

Unfortunately, this is little more than a colorful apologia for Democrats suffering through the Clinton impeachment.  It probably brought a warm glow to the intended readers, but hardly offers any guidance for those emotionally less engaged.<br />Drew outlines her story line very quickly.  Chapter 1 is called 'Setup' and describes the impossibility of 'good' people getting anything done in Washington.  Chapter 2 argues Washington has become a hateful place.  This allows Drew to delight her Democratic audience with 1-liners on Washington luminaries.<br />The [lack of civility] 'can be attributed to Newt Gingrich' (pg 20).<br /> 'Daschle is a great tactician'.<br />'There are only a few great legislators anymore.  Senator Edward M. Kennedy is one of them' (pg 24).<br /> 'So, by the time Newt Ginrich become Speaker of the House, the religious right and Republican Party had effectively merged' (pg 34).<br />'[Mike] Mansfield, always a laconic, modest, unflashy man, did, as he acknowledged, enjoy a majority of 65 Democrats to 35 Republicans,\\"Think of it!\\" he said in a rare moment of impishness. '(pg 40).<br />'Carter himself became an exemplary ex-President; unlike Gerald Ford and Ronald Reagan until he became to ill' (pg 62).<br />What pathos! The evil Reagan persists in his error until Alzheimer's takes away his memory.<br />After making it clear that most Republicans are evil and most Democrats saints, we return to campaign finance.  Chapter 3, 'The First Amendment' argues campaigns finance and free speech are unrelated.  Chapter 4, 'The Money Culture', argues that fund raising speech has replaced political discourse.<br />With this moral framework established, Drew spends the rest of the book being play-by-play announcer for events in Washington between 1996 and 1999.  As best I can tell, Drew argues the ideological and mercenary Republicans impeached Clinton because the Religious-Right threatened to stop donating money.<br />For someone who dislikes both Democrats and Republicans, there isn't much substance. For someone seeking to understand the impact of McCain-Feingold in 2004, it isn't there.mpeached Clinton because the Religious-Right threatened to stop donating money.<br />For someone who dislikes both Democrats and Republicans, there isn't much substance.

First, it seeks to debunk the notion that the 'golden mean' is intuitively pleasing to all humans.  Secondly, the book argues that we can best understand the cosmic meaning of life via numbers.  From these two theses, the author establishes the 'genius' mathematician as mediator and priest between mankind and the cosmos.<br />Ok, enough mumbo-jumbo.  If the above interests you, read the last chapter first. It should have been used as the introduction and will clarify the purpose of arguments presented throughout the book.<br />Getting back to the book's narrative, the early sections seek to debunk various claims that Egyptian and Mesopotamian civilization use the Fibonacci ratio.  Reports of its use in China are ignored.  Later, there is a section debunking the notion that great art 'uses' the Golden Mean.  Scattered throughout are developments in number theory, starting with Pythagoras and continuing with the standard European mathematical genius roll call. The last chapters reveal the relationship between the Golden Mean and complexity/chaos theory/fuzzy logic/quantum theory/etc.<br />Livio's Fibonacci sequence, Penrose tilings, and quasi-crystals stories will probably engage the recreational mathematicians among us, and provide a handy 'all in one place' summary of such matters.  Others will find the philosophic overtones tangential and/or distracting.  Any successful philosophy of math needs to address the issues of cardinality and ordinality at the level of intuition.  The two topics are dismissed by page 15, but they underlie the whole issue of 'intuitive acceptance of number theory'.  This topic is discussed throughout the book as Livio seeks to explain why so many people see the Golden Mean in ancient works of architecture, modern art and stock market charts.  Curiously, Livio argues they all got it wrong and only genius mathematicians have the gift of 'intiutive acceptance of number theory'. Not an argument which many will find satisfying, but for the passionately recreational mathematician, it may be seductive.will find satisfying, but for the passionately recreational mathematician, it may be seductive.	2004-03-29

Hayes, Samuel Tilden, and the Stolen Election of 1876	Books	2	27	39	N	N	War by other means	It is unfortunate that the election of 1876 continues to be described in terms the Ku Klux Klan would smile upon.  Consider the casual use of honored Klan terms such as 'carpetbagger' (any northern federalist) and 'scalawag' (any southern federalist). For Democrat Tilden, Morris quotes but immediately rebuts newspaper slander.  For black election commissioners, the newspaper slander is gospel.  When white 'rifle clubs'murder former members of federal colored units in Edgefield, it is explained away with conflicting testimony. When (federalist) South Carolina election officials throw out the Edgefield votes, Morris tells us the black vote was probably split.  When former slaves lose the right to vote, we are told their 'rights' were just an 'experiment.'<br />Just what was the 'Fraud of the Century'?  Morris concludes the book by claiming he finds Hayes 'personally blameless'.  I wondered just what Morris thought the fraud to be until discovering the book is an elaboration of a 1988 article and the title is a quoted headline used to conclude the article.  Morris makes no argument for a specific 'fraud', instead he is simply sharing one contemporary opinion.<br />I came to the book to read about Hayes and his fraud.  The fraud I was interested in reading about was not covered, though.  I thought the fraud of 1876 was Hayes' 'bargain' with Wade Hampton and other Southern slave-ocrats.  In return for the presidency, Hayes agreed to forget the 15th amendment to the US constitution.<br />Morris convinced me the fraud lay elsewhere.  If nothing else, Morris argues the election of 1876 was 'war by other means.'  Both Republican and Democrats were led by former generals.  Prior to 1876, the activity was called a 'canvass'.  After 1876, it was called a 'campaign'.  Tilden, a man without military connections and experience in command of troops, never had a chance.<br />Consider a less Klanish version of events in Charleston.  On Feb 18th, 1865, Charleston fell to units of the 21st US Colored Troops, followed by two companies of the 54th Massachusetts Volunteers (colored).  After Lincoln's death, slave-ocrat leaning President Johnson kept southerners of color who had served in the federal army from voting and allowed the election of slave-ocrat colonel, James Orr.  Orr's term in office was cut short by Federal General Robert K. Scott, who establish voting rights for federal colored soldiers. In 1874, a former lieutenant of Colored calvary, with the support of former colored South Carolina troops was elected governor, Daniel Chamberlain. This brings us to 4 murders in Edgefield, rifle clubs, night riders and the election of slavo-crat hero Wade Hampton.<br />Which brings us back to locating the 'fraud of the century' and its meaning in the context of 'war by other means.'  Until the readmission of rebel states, the civil rights of the slavo-crat soldiers were suspended, including their right to vote in elections. In fact, because the Rebels had taken up arms against their own nation - an act of treason according to the Constitution (\\"Treason against the United States shall consist only in levying war against them . . .\\" Art. III, Sec. 3, cl. 1), they could have been executed (Art. III, Sec. 3, cl. 2). Instead, amnesty was granted to the Rebels if they took an oath of fidelity to the United States, including the 15th Amendment which guaranteed the voting rights of former federal colored soldiers.  Maybe, the artful way these oaths were circumvented represented the 'fraud of the century.'  Morris was right.  Hayes could do little to change the reality of politics south of the Mason-Dixon line.<br />The US is now engaged the preliminaries to another election in-lieu of war.

Finding the commentary a little thin, I looked for something a bit more thought provoking and got a copy of this book.<br />The book is organized into introductory comments, the ancient text itself and an extended exegesis.  For my taste, the introductory comments were too short and the exegesis too long.  I had to force my way through LeLoup's geometric hierarchies of spiritual insights which include a quadrangle labeled in counter clockwise order from the top, 'I AM', 'The Teacher', I am not' and 'The Human'.  In the center, within 4 concentric circles is (from top to bottom) 'masculine,' ANTHROPOS' and 'feminine'.  Additionally, LeLoup provides us with a 10 page commentary on the 10 Commandments, almost 10% of the exegesis.<br />The ancient text provides LeLoup plenty of justification for this numerology.  Mary describes a vision that includes the soul's journey through 4 climates.  The 4th climate (also called wrath) had 7 manifestations darkness, craving, ignorance, lethal jealousy, enslavement of the body, intoxicated wisdom, guileful wisdom.  Though I winced more than once, I'm glad I read it.  It is important to slow down the thought processes while trying to tease out a context for the ancient-source text.  I had to wonder if one could compare the numerology to that originating in India a few hundred year before Jesus and Mary walked the earth.<br />The introduction was all to brief and will leave you wanting more.  The Berlin Papyrus, and the Rylands Papyrus should have been described as physical objects with a chemical composition, process of creation, evidence of age and current condition.  What do we know about other documents of the same age?  What group of people would have been writing it? Storing it?  What can we surmise regarding the missing pages 1-6 and 11-14. Is the Nag Hammadi library's 'Sophia (Wisdom) of Jesus' an embellished version of the Mary Gospel?<br />More could be done with the translation of specific terms.  In particular, what in other translations is rendered 'male' is rendered here as 'fully human'.  What is elsewhere rendered 'mind', is rendered 'nous'.  The delicate shades need to be explicitly explored, probably by multiple authors (including someone familiar with the 7 chakras).  LeLoups takes a start at this, but I can't abide with his geometric solution.  Additionally, there ought to be a discussion of what clues in the text might suggest the authority of eye-witness commentary (or lack of same).n of the Mary Gospel?<br />More could be done with the translation of specific terms.

Almost every 2 page layout can stand on its own as a graphic/textual design.  I particularly enjoyed the discussion of the creative and destructive cycles.  This wasn't anything new, but it made sense for the first time.<br />The book strongly emphasizes the coordination of garden layout with a southern facing home entrance.  There really are no alternatives offered.  I found this a bit rigid at first, but the northern exposure of any garden wall will always have limited sunlight, so I concluded it might not be entirely unreasonable.<br />Ms Too minces few words when something strikes her as a bad idea. I think at one point, she concludes a misplaced water feature could lead to madness in the family.  This is likely to offend some, but one won't be bored!<br />The book seems a good reference.

There are a variety of interesting facts presented, but the narrative fails.  Aczel organizes his comments around a visit to Amalfi, Italy.  According to the book, he arrives in Amalfi to celebrate the birth of Flavio Gioia, a celebrated 13th century Amalfi native whom locals credit with inventing the compass.  Wanting to know more about Flavio, he goes to an Amalfi library for research reading.  The result is this little tome.  At the book's conclusion, our investigative reporter looks up at the understanding librarian, provides words of appreciation and leaves.<br />We then learn that the first known use of magnetic direction devices was Chinese divination practice, now known as Feng Shui.  It seems the first use of a compass was architectural.  The Chinese liked having their front doors facing the auspicious south.  Sometime around 1100, someone in Italy discoved Feng Shui navigation.  It seems Feng Shui architectural tools were equally useful for turning a boat's bow to the south.  Further, the always inventive Italians put the device in a box for easy divination during off shore religious services.  This was particularly useful during inclement weather.<br />I guess the 'riddle' was 'who was Fabio Gioa?', but this pleasant chunk of local folklore is quickly dismissed as legend springing from a missing comma in some 15th century manuscript. An alternative might have been 'who invented the compass,' but it is clear this cannot be deduced.  A third mystery involves the changing 'compass rose'.  On ancient maps, there were 12 directions.  Sometime during the 13th century, maps started using a 16 direction 'compass rose'.  Who or what sparked that change?<br />While these issues have the makings of an excellent story on the social shaping of technology, the author never really bring the issues into focus.  There are lots of curious details, but the author forgets the punchline.<br />A lot of time is spend speculating on who 'invented' the compass. Since the familiar European compass is little more than a boxed Chinese 'pivoting magnetized needle', it isn't clear the 12th century Italian design is really an 'invention' at all. This could have provided an interesting segway to an investigation of 'creation' myths in general.  It seems many medieval technological imports from China and/or the Muslim Caliphates get transmuted from 'import' to 'invention' in the 16th century. Why these myths were so important, and still offered credibility seems an important topic, but Aczel only alludes to the issue.iliar European compass is little more than a boxed Chinese 'pivoting magnetized needle', it isn't clear the 12th century Italian design is really an 'invention' at all.

To clarify what this meant, he asked his Christian friends to identify the best Christian literature.  The result of their efforts are now sold in every book store as 'the Bible'.<br />'The Other Gospels' pulls together what we know about the Jesus stories that got left out.  Since making copies of paper was an expensive and time consuming activity, little of 'the other stuff' remained in circulation.  Some of it was 'suppressed', but book burning gets more playing time than it deserves.  Most of this material was probably just forgotten.  And, most of it is suitably forgettable.<br />Cameron pulls together the pieces archeologists have discovered in the last 200 years, and tried to interest the reader in the 'trajectory' of Jesus stories.  He finds it interesting to note how oral story telling traditions tend to elaborate source material and add features addressing interests of the story teller. Detailed arguments about these trajectories are omitted, though.  The commentaries prior to each 'omitted' gospel fragment are brief and disconnected from each other.  Perhaps Cameron wished to avoid contention and argument.<br />I wished he had offered a more detailed and coherent argument regarding 'trajectories.'  In particular, I would have liked information on how these documents were used.  Were they memorized?  Were they used in ritual?  Were they given to children as literature lessons?<br />The best of the material (Gospels of Thomas and Miriam) can be found in books devoted entirely to themselves.  The rest is somewhat harder to find (especially in one place).	2003-12-11

I am writing for those who might share my perspective, and do not want to diminish the perfection of this book for many people.<br />This is only the third book on Feng Shui that I've read.  My immediate interest was sparked by reading 'Clear Your Clutter with Feng Shui' by Karen Kingston.  Wanting to learn more and using my engineering research skills, I combed the reviews here and picked 'Living Color'.  My color IQ is nil and I hoped the book might offer some assistance.<br />Unfortunately, I was too dense to make much of the insights offered.  The various matrices of color vs. room or color vs. business or color foreground vs. color background went over my head.  I'm already a habitual list/matrix maker, but they are memory aids for recalling 'known' insights.  In this case, the original insight eluded me, so recalling it offered me little.<br />I did enjoy the first 3 chapters, which included preparatory material.  Perhaps the book was simply too advanced for me.  For example, the notion of a destructive and creative color cycle is very appealing; I just couldn't get a feel for it.<br />Near the end of the book, the use of color as part of meditation practice is described.  I appreciated this section, too.	2003-11-30

The author is Rita Katz and she leads the SITE Institute (Search for International Terrorists).  The ruse of 'anonymous' was put to rest by a lawsuit filed against Ms. Katz and CBS by two of the organizations she writes about, the Heritage Educational Trust and Safa Trust.<br />On the Safa Trust, the Washington Post wrote on 10/7/02:<br />\\"The SAAR network consists of more than 100 Muslim think tanks, charities and companies, many of which are linked by overlapping boards of directors, shared offices and the circular movement of money, according to tax forms and federal investigators. .. The SAAR Foundation officially dissolved in December 2000, and many of its functions were taken over by another group, Safa Trust, run by many of the same people. ...U.S. and European investigators say they have uncovered information in the Bahamas and Europe that in recent years some SAAR entities' funds have moved to two men, Youssef Nada and Ahmed Idris Nasreddin, designated by the United States as terrorist financiers.\\"<br />Meanwhile, families of World Trade Center victims have sued SAAR, Safa Trust, Heritage Education Trust and a host of Saudis.  The Feb 21,2003 issue of the New York Times reported that one of the chief targets of Ms. Katz investigation, Sami Al-Arian was charged by Federal prosecutors with racketeering charges as part of a efforts to finance and support suicide bombings in Israel.<br />In short, Anonymous is hardly anonymous and the stories she tells are easily corroborated by doing a little searching on the net.<br />The Terrorist Hunter parallels Steven Emerson's 'American Jihad'.  It seems Ms. Katz worked for Emerson until 2002 when she left and started her own organization, so the links are more than coincidence.  Personally, I found 'Terrorist Hunter' far more effective than 'American Jihad'. Rather than be bogged down in intellectual debates, Katz grounds her story with the murder of her father and grandmother.  She then details a childhood that yuppie parents will immediately recognize as hyper-activity and attention deficit, a personality type perfectly suited for the I-Spy mentality of her book.  Finally, she makes no effort to hide her passions, tears and personal demons.  Every personal crisis gets built up into a matter of earth shattering importance and makes the narrative seem like so much bluster.<br />On the other hand, I had to ask myself with what motivation would I require to tell a similar story.  Engaging in this dialog, trying to understand how I would feel if trapped in the same circumstances, is probably what I found best about 'Terrorist Hunter.'  I asked myself how I would feel if my father had been killed at a Sabbath supper by a stranger wrapped in shrapnel laced dynamite, singing praises to his God?  I don't think this question far fetched in our increasingly small world. The book is a starting point, something to motivate more reading, more thinking, maybe even more passion.he then details a childhood that yuppie parents will immediately recognize as hyper-activity and attention deficit, a personality type perfectly suited for the I-Spy mentality of her book.

My only complaint was the brevity of it all, but that's the problem with a page-turner, they are over too quickly.<br />The story is retold in terms that might remind you of the 'moon program'.  A non-techie evangelist's son gets caught up in an impossible dream, but find the people that can do the job and succeeds.  It is a bit too simple, but works.  Like JFK, our hero Cyrus Field refuses to give up.  As in 'The Right Stuff', we wade through one disaster after another, all the while waiting for victory to yield her treasures.  The biographical pictures of various inventors, quacks and robber-barons ought to fascinate any but the die hard soap-opera fan. Sorry, the only marital issues I noticed were questions about how our heroic men stayed married while obsessed with this project.  In very un-politically correct style, there isn't a single woman mentioned in a non-supportive spousal role.<br />Despite my enjoyment, I wish the book had been about 4 times longer.  There was little real detail regarding the competition, science, inventions or economics.  There is another page-turner available, 'Signal &amp; Noise: A Novel by John Griesemer.  It covers exactly the same territory, with more character development and female roles. Otherwise, there isn't much more than material published by the participants. The Atlantic telegraph (1865) by William Howard Russell;  The story of the Atlantic Telegraph by Henry M. Field and Submarine Telegraphs: Their History, Construction and Working by Charles Bright.  All three are long out of press.	2003-11-28

I'm still not sure I understand the 'discovery story'. As best I can tell, the text was found in an ancient urn with 50+ other manuscripts.  The contents of the urn are now called a library, based on the assumption someone hid their library in the urn and buried it.<br />The actual 'gospel' is easier to read than I expected.  It reminded me of Zen koans and I enjoy a good riddle.<br />But, puzzled I remain.  The various interpretations offered by the book leave me wondering and feeling a need to read more.  In particular, I'd like to know how to place these documents in the context of other 2nd century manuscripts.	2003-11-13

The book caught my eye at the library for some unknown reason and I started reading it only because it was the thinnest book on my night stand.  A day after turning the first page, I was driving my pickup truck back and forth to the recycling center.<br />I doubt everyone will find the same tonic when reading the book, but it worked for me.  I think it provided a non-dogmatic twist on 'cleanliness (clutterless-ness) is next to Godliness' and 'the truth (no clutter) will set you free'.  Additionally, I suspect the exercise of thinking about family, friends, fame, prosperity, creativity, health, knowledge and livelihood as distinct issues can't hurt.	2003-11-13

It is probably a good book to have around, though.  If for no other reason than finding references to unconventional themes.<br />The book is thoroughly 'post-modern,' in the sense it rigidly attempts to be a non-narrative.  A non-narrative narrative is exceptionally hard to read unless you already know the narrative upon which the author is reacting against.<br />Anyway, the authors attempt to avoid the pitfalls of historical narratives by organizing their material around social phenomena: institutions and the broad endeavors institutions attempt. No heroes allowed. The book sort of reads like an outline searching for a story line, but I found a number of interesting factoids.  I particularly liked the discussion of medical versus legal universities.<br />Despite the rule against heroes,  Francis Bacon gets mentioned in almost every chapter.  Everything seems to go back to the 'Baconian project.'  The Arabs and Chinese little or no credit.<br />Following is a list of the chapters, with my guess at the theme:<br />PART I INSTITUTIONS<br />Teaching (universities)<br />Sharing: (scientific societies)<br />Watching: (observatories)<br />Showing: (Museums, botanical gardens and zoos)<br />Reading: (journals) (in enterprises)<br />Killing: (Armies) (in enterprises)<br />PART 11 ENTERPRISES<br />Measuring:<br />Traveling: (maps and explorations)<br />Counting: (Math)<br />PART III SENSIBILITIES<br />Women in science<br />Colonies and science<br />Science and Religion<br />I enjoyed the early chapters much more than the later.

The book is a collection, and the 'field work' is more enthusiastic than thought provoking.  Binding together the fieldwork, at front and back, is the analysis of Arquilla and Ronfeldt.  Though only 20% of the text, their comments make the reading exceptionally rewarding.<br />The deep dynamic guiding Arquilla and Ronfeldt's analysis is that the information revolution favors the rise of network forms of organization and thus redefines cooperation and conflict. According to their terminology, the really bad side is 'cyberwar', an earlier book.  'Netwar' is a more ambiguous form of network conflict, one that can be used by social activists for the benefit of all.  While I find their scholarship excellent, I'm less than sanguine regarding our ability to distinguish enthusiasm from cohersion.<br />The term netwar calls attention to the prospect of network-based conflict becoming pervasive at all levels of social interaction.  Just as romance is now streamlined by online match-makers, so too will the new technologies enhance and focus aggression, both the good and bad kind.  According to the authors, 'Netwar' is a form of 'just warfare.'  Most of the book covers examples of non-violent, democratic netwar-warriors.There is a brief review of traditional crime going online for drug distribution efficiencies, but most is devoted to friendly political activists ranging from Zapatistas to anti-globalists.<br />Fortunately, the authors forget their preoccupation with Zapatistas when trying to make sense of the field work.  In particular, they focus on the remarkably vague notions we attach to the term 'networks'.  It seems everyone knows what it means, but no one has the same concept in mind.<br />Wisely, the authors point out our need to define 'network organization' itself. To this end, they offer a very thoughtful survey of network organization theory. Avoiding easy answers, they list some provocative, but contradictory theories. The reader is left to piece together their own conclusions<br />They provide 3 perspectives: 1)  'actor and link,' 2) 'methodological' and  3) 'Naturalist'.  In more familiar domains, there are the perspectives of the physicist, sociologist and botanist.<br />Probably most of the literature defines networks in terms of 'actors' (nodes) and 'links' (ties) whose relationships have a patterned structure. Using this scheme, one can draw a set of basic shapes for networks: chain or line networks, hub/star/wheel networks, all channel and hybrid networks.<br />An alternative 'actor' framework is the notion of 'friendship cliques' and 'interlocking memberships.'  This suggests the notion of networks of networks.  One 'actor' can belong to a variety of 'cliques', thus interlocking a variety of networks.  One's personal power relates to their network assets, not personal attributes. In this case, the 'unit of analysis' is not the individual 'actor', but the network as a distinct identity. The network functions to create opportunities for both it's members and for it's 'network self. '<br />Another 'actor' framework stresses the importance of specific 'actor' roles.  In this view, small group dynamics rely on a natural self-organization process that sorts out specific roles, and creates roles for outsiders to play. Here the focus is on the tight/loose connectedness of individuals to their network and the network to other networks.  In this scheme, degrees of reciprocity characterize exchanges between parties (both individual and group). This 'flow' between actors is colored by the roles each accepts and the diversity is great.  Equality is only one of many ways to order relationships.<br />An entirely different focus is upon measurement of 'network' units. One measure is the individual's recognition of the network as an entity. For example, network analysts might ask whether the actors recognize that they are participating in a particular network, and whether they are committed to operating as a network.  'Who do you work for?' represents the archetypical  question/issue. An even deeper issue is the notion of 'self' and the ability of a 'network' to allow 'selfhood' to emerge.  Though somewhat distant from mainstream terminology, almost everyone will understand the notion that organizations have a 'mind of their own' and that it implies the network has a 'selfhood' it will strive to protect.<br />Finally, the authors include the 'naturalist' view of Fukuyama that networks are nothing new, that networks are nothing more than 'trust' communities.  Trust communities are nothing new. Along the same lines are 'small world' network theories, a body of thought that suggests networks and 'life' itself are inextricably woven together.<br />While the networking form of social organization has existed in other times and spaces, the new information technology paradigm provides the material basis for its pervasive expansion throughout a global social domain.  Along these lines, they quote Keck and Sikkink's notion that networks are defined as &quot;forms of organization characterized by voluntary, reciprocal, and horizontal patterns of communication and exchange.  This seems addressed at one of the most universally recognized phenomena of networks, resiliency to shock unless a key hub (if there is one) is taken down. This interest in survival is a key part of the naturalist perspective.<br />In what I find the most illuminating discussion, the authors encompass the wide diversity in network theory by suggesting a multi-level theory of organization to account for network dynamics and resilience.  In their scheme, there are 5 levels;<br />1. organizational design.<br />2. the narrative story about the network's genesis and powers.<br />3. The doctrinal habits used for producing desired outcomes, initiating newcomers and developing seniority.<br />4. Technological tools<br />5. Personal ties of loyalty and trust.<br />Personally, I suspect networks, like the Internet, evolve without a plan.  They emerge and persist in spite of their plans and desires of those that give them concrete reality.  Thus, I somewhat disagree with the 'title' of level #1, if not the concept.<br />Their focus on level #2, the network's organizational story, is probably the most original and insightful.

(Arabic Thought and Culture)	Books	3	26	46	N	N	Interesting, but myopic	Filled with detail regarding books translated by people living under Abbasid rule, Gutas omits any reference to the contemporary revolution in paper manufacture. Surely, he would agree the 90% drop in writing material costs contributed to the blossoming of book publication (if still hand written). Additionally, Gutas fails to mention the education of scribes nor the practice of reading the Koran and Hadif.<br />Instead, the focus is almost entirely on the intellect.  Little Gutas considers has temporal context.  The Abbasid debates over Aristotle could just as easily taken place in the Alexandria of Ptolemy. There is a valuable, but limited discussion of Muslim evangelism and interactions between Muslim rulers and Christian sects.  I would have appreciated more.<br />Gutas argues that the motivation for translation emerged from the Abbasid need to assimilate the Persian (Sassanid) Empire.  The primary influence in the Sassanid tradition was Zoroastrian philosophy and its globalism. While this is entirely plausible, it strikes me as exaggerated. Additionally, the logic gets a bit twisted as it develops.  By the end of the book, the conjectured Sassanid influence has made Aristotle, not Zoroaster, the prime focus of philosophical attention.<br />Though far broader in stroke, a much better analysis of the translation movement can be found in &quot;Paper Before Print: The History and Impact of Paper in the Islamic world&quot;<br />by Jonathan M.

The first, by Shanks, describes the now infamous 'James ossuary'.  Shanks reviews the discovery, early inspections, and display in Canada. Alluding to a civil lawsuit where only a majority is required to determine the case, he concludes that the balance of evidence supports the authenticity of the box and inscription.<br />After more research, the majority clearly thinks the object a fraud. Shanks and all the experts he quotes look incompetent.  Since I didn't know the outcome of the academic investigation until after finishing the book, the outcome provides something of a detective story thrill that wasn't anticipated.<br />The second part of the book, by Witherington, ignores the ossuary and simply recaps ancient references to James.  Witherington assumes the reader came to the subject of James due to the press reports on the bone-box, and tries to answer questions that a Western reader would ask.  In brief, he tries to date various undated documents and infer their author's experiences, motives and assumptions.  In particular, he draws a picture of 3rd century Roman polemicists seeking to advance their social agendas.<br />I enjoyed the second part, and it is unfortunate that the blunders of Shanks will undoubtedly put Witherington in a very bad light.	2003-09-10

Duncan starts his book with his arrival at college and gives us a blow-by-blow recap of his ups and downs while enjoying a life in graduate school.  You have to get past reviews, you have to get published, you have to find post-doc positions, you have to find people to co-author papers.<br />The goal of all this was a little hard to discern.  Was he working towards a tenured position in a major university?  Was he trying to solve a specific problem?  Was he trying to teach us something about networks?  We never find out.  The story ends with a curiously brief and fuzzy recap of his latest work.<br />Well, that's how diaries generally end.<br />It's not my favorite kind of book.  I am interested in network theory, not the outcome of a walk in the park with professor X.  I didn't care if Barbasi published a solution before Duncan thought up the question.<br />At some levels, I simply disagreed with Duncan.  He seems quite comfortable with 'Blank Slate' notions of human nature, which seems entirely silly to me.  His focus on getting an idea published first depressed me.  Stories about who is 'first' are important to sports fans, lawyers and professors. Sports fans simply enjoy the thrill of the race. Lawyers use a court to establish who is 'first' to steal the ideas of less legally minded inventors.  Professors fight over who is first to win tenure and long sabbaticals.  In the real world, most ideas get conjured up over and over, again.  That's what happens in networks.<br />A much more complete and concise science of networks, see 'Netwar'.

Most readers will probably think of General Ward's biography in terms of traditional 19th century nation state narratives.  Let me propose a different one, the context is 'opium wars'. The story goal is defeating the merchants of opium, the English.  The outcome is bittersweet. This requires the reader to do more 'reading between the lines' than usual, but the rewards are there for those interested.<br />While the book's focus is Fredrick Ward, a true soldier of fortune, the 'Chinese drug wars' are really more central.  The period covered begins with the British winning the 'Opium War'.  To make sense of this, imagine Columbian drug lords defeating the US Army and demanding control of an airport in Miami.  By treaty right, the Columbian drug lords would we granted the right to fly cocaine to any airport in America.  If you can imagine this, substitute Queen Victoria for the Columbian drug lords and Shanghai for Miami.<br />As should be required, the book begins by discussing hypocrisy.  England's Royal navy is primarily in China to help the East India Company sell opium. The 'Christian' leader of the Taiping rebellion preaches puritanical virtues, but surrounds himself with concubines.  Our hero emerges from the New England merchant class, a class that simultaneously smuggles slaves to the American slave states and finances abolitionist politics.  Unfortunately, the theme is not followed throughout. The final chapter dwells on legal battles over Ward's treasures rather than the continuing twists in the drug wars and associated hypocrisy.<br />The narrative spends most of its time on Ward's invention, the 'Ever Victorious Army' or 'Ward's Chinese Corps'. As evidence that necessity is the mother of invention, the 'Ever Victorious Army' came into existence through the whim of fortune.  Western powers in Shanghai had no desire to see it emerge, since it represented a threat to the British control of the opium trade.  The Imperial Chinese were to entrench in tradition to accept the innovation.  It was only the existence of a 100,000 man rebel army 30 miles from Shanghai that provided Ward his 'opportunity' to build his vision.<br />Fredrick Ward remains something of a mystery in his biography. He died in action before we could really tell what he was building. Few of his letters escaped destruction, so we rarely hear his own voice.  Instead, Carr is forced to infer from events and news paper accounts.  Most readers will have to overcome their skepticism about Ward's career being ample material for a full-fledged biography.  In this context, Ward seems the forgotten inventor.  Charles 'Chinese' Gordon won the publicity war and his buddies wrote the history books. Gordon 'China' role is limited compared to Ward. Gordon took over Ward's cross-cultural invention, the 'Ever Victorious Army', and won the army's last battle.  His job was simply to maintain it long enough to win one battle, and peacefully disband the thing.  For this, he gets his own big budget Hollywood movie, Khartoum, staring Charleston Heston.  In contrast, Ward invents a modern Chinese Army and provides a working model to interested Japanese observers.  Guess who I think more interesting.to the British control of the opium trade.

Chapter 1 covers American 'White' slavery, something that needs a lot more attention.  Page 1 includes a photo of an adorable 'White' girl of about 8 whose freedom was purchased by abolishionists in the 1850s.  Chapter 2 retells stories of the early 'tent revivals' now known as the 'Great Awakening'. The twist here is to tell it in terms of the slave reaction. Chapter 2 is probably the best chapter of the book.  I've never seen anyone make a case for the Great Awakening enticing slaves to 'buy' the American dream, but Talty makes a good argument for it.  The Great Awakening too often gets ignored in our overly materialist ethos.<br />The next two chapters lose a bit of energy.  Chapter 3 is titled 'The Mulatto Flag: Interracial Love in Antebellum America.\\"  I'm not sure what flag Talty sees waving, because he never distinguishes 'mulatto' as a positive notion, in and of itself.  Being 'mulatto' is just something that one happens to get labelled.  There are some interesting stories here, though.  I didn't know that there were documented cases of 'white' men drinking a few drops of their 'Black' lover's blood to claim mulatto status and get a marriage license.  Apparently, this method of gaining mulatto status is written into the popular play 'Showboat.'  Chapter four covers the Civil War in 6 short pages.  I think this a mistake and the book never really recaptures it's narative drive.<br />Chapter 5 is called \\"Memorizing Shakespeare: The Black Elite\\".  W.E.B. Du Bois is the central hero.  Du Bois reacts against being 'whiter than white' (memorizing Shakespeare) and seeks to define a 3rd way.  Talty argues Du Bois' book 'Souls of Black Folk' does this, but the argument is too abstract to gain traction.<br />With Du Bois out of the way, Talty spend the rest of the book doing musicology to avoid talking about the sexual taboos that define 'whiteness' or 'blackness.'  I don't object to the detailed history of Jazz, but the music metaphor did little for me for the last 100 pages of the book.  Explaining contemporary racism in terms of music history may provide a way to encode your thoughts without offending anyone, but whatever Talty's purpose, it eluded me.<br />The last chapter is called, 'The Death of Coercion'. I don't think the word 'mulatto' is mentioned once.  Instead, Talty makes the mistake of hoping we will simply forget the terms 'white', 'black' and 'mulatto'. After describing Terry McMillan's 'A Day Late and a Dollar Short,' he writes, \\"Black style, black tradition, black suffering, the black story: all are as vital and real as one's blood type.  But 'race' in the abstract - that unseen presence that defined one's essential place in the world - has lost most of its terrors and its charms.\\"<br />This seems to avoid the issue.  As best I can tell, despite 'race' meaning a lot of different things to different people, the notion continues to play a role in day to day life.  The Supreme Court recently  ruled colleges could use 'race' as a criteria for selecting new students.  President Bush recently talked at a NAACP meeting while Democratic presidential hopefuls ignored a NAACP convention.  Both events made the evening news.  In Tulsa, legal action is being taken by victims of a 1920 era race riot.<br />The title 'Mulatto Nation' implies a commentary on 'amalgamation' and the 'melting pot' metaphor.  Neither are popular intellectual ideas these days.  'Mulatto Nation' seems to suggest the melting is taking place unconsciously, in the music, in the way we act.  Without addressing the conflict between unconscious and conscious, the book misses an important opportunity.<br />Personally, I object to forgetting about 'race'.  Much of the 'race' problem is white fathers forgetting about their 'colored' descendents (whatever colored happened to mean).  Thomas Jefferson didn't leave Monticello to his first born son.  He freed him from slavery, but never acknowledged him.  Fredrick Douglas came to terms with his plantation owning father after the Civil War, but he didn't inherit the farm.  Until 1967, 17 states prohibited 'black' - 'white' marriages, but this didn't preclude many mixed common law marriages.  What the laws accomplished was a denial of the rights of inheritance.  The son of a white father and black mother could not inherit the father's estate.  I don't think this sort of thing is easily forgotten.

The scenes range from the holocaust like 40s to the puzzling 90s.  In 1940 30 of 48 states held 'Black'/'White' marriages to be a crime.  In 1967, 17 states still criminalized marriage between 'Blacks' and 'Whites'.  In 1958, 96 % 'Whites' disapproved of marriages between  'Blacks' and 'Whites'.<br />The 60s were a time of change, though. Between 1960 and 2000, the number of 'Black'/'White' marriages increased by 400%. Between 1860 and 1970, marriages between 'whites' and 'blacks' were a highly emotional political issue. Now, the political debate centers on how to rid ourselves of the taboo.  In 1997, 61% of 'Whites' said they approved of mixed marriages. Given America's history of blood thirsty 'White' lynch mobs murdering random 'Black' males, one might conclude something very significant had happened.. The book wonders if the taboo will soon disappear.<br />The first descriptions of the monster are pulled from the 1930s and 40s.  It is horrible. The text will bring many to tears. It is easy to imagine, but hard to believe. Quote by ugly quote, the US government, US judiciary and vast numbers of ordinary people are implicated in this American brand of torture. We start with the story of a war bride coming to America to join her husband. It's the perfect story of an American GI and English sweetheart, but the GI is 'Black' so every 'White' functionary (including taxi drivers) attempt to dissuade our fair Juliet from consummating her desires. The stories only get more and more tragic. One wonders how our heroic lovers persevered.<br />The next two chapters deal with the immediate post war era. One covers the 'white' attempt to make sure nothing changes. The second looks into the arrival of 'Black'-'White' marriages in traditionally 'Black' extended families. The 'White' reaction is only slightly less holocaust like than the pre-war stories. The stories are not quite as tragic, but still provide a shock per page. The 'black' version is one of ambivalence. This ambivalence will play a bigger role later when it sets the stage for black' interest in maintaining the taboo.<br />The next three chapters cover the 50s to 60s. In this case, we pick up the notion of a emerging culture of artists, primarily musicians, and rebel intellectuals rejecting conventional society's taboos. Simultaneously, the colleges of America offer debates over various social programs. Meanwhile, the 'Black' soldiers returning from the war were organizing social revolution.  Each setting provides case studies for 'Black'-'White' love stories from the era.<br />As we enter the late 70s we are told the story of 'talking black and sleeping white.' Now that the battle for voting rights had been won, and the Supreme Court has tossed out 'black-white' marriage prohibitions, the white participants in 'black' 'white' marriages suddenly discovered the Black side of the family isn't as ambivalent as 20 years before. If fact, there are some new issues to address. 'Black' pride suddenly emerged.  'Black' women objected the common sight of famous 'Black' athletes marrying 'White' brides.<br />And, here we end our tale. Oddly confused.  The taboo, whatever it is or was, may have mutated!<br />To conclude, Prof Romano suggests the taboo is too difficult for mere individuals to overcome. &quot;Indeed, interracial relationships today are increasingly being heralded as a sign of the country's success in overcoming racial inequality.  Yet, the significance of the transformation that has occurred since the 1940s must be kept in perspective.  Although the growing numbers of black-white couples demonstrate that the color line in the United States has become considerably  more fluid, to take these marriages as proof that racism has disappeared or that race no longer carries much significance in American life oversimplifies the current racial situation.  The taboo against interracial marriage has eroded significantly since World War II, but the increased social acceptance of interracial relationships does not necessarily mean the structural and institutional race inequalities no longer exist.&quot;<br />So, in the end, we are delivered a political message. I guess with something so mysteriously persistent, we all end up grasping at straws. It's kind of a screwy change of pace, but this opens the 'epilogue': Is love the answer?<br />In short, Prof. Romano answers 'no.'  &quot;There is no question that interracial love will become more common and even more accepted as racial barriers erode in American society, but it will take more than love to break down those barriers.  Old hierarchies must be dismantled for new attitudes about interracial love and marriage to flourish.'<br />While interesting, I don't find Romano's political argument well developed.  She's got it backwards and her stories demonstrate this fact, old hierarchies are nothing when compared to the force of nature represented by a man and a woman who happen to want each other's company in the most intimate and complete manner possible.<br />For a version of the 'love solves all' perspective, see Mulatto-Nation.  Rather than starting at a 1940s cross burning, Mulatto-Nation starts with a detailed description of white slavery prior to the civil war.  According to the book, a majority of Americans are already mulatto, biologically and socially.  We just haven't accepted it psychologically.nst interracial marriage has eroded significantly since World War II, but the increased social acceptance of interracial relationships does not necessarily mean the structural and institutional race inequalities no longer exist.&quot;<br />So, in the end, we are delivered a political message.

I got the book after reading a history of paper and thought knowing more about this famous treasure trove of ancient scrolls would make interesting reading. I was not disappointed.<br />The book is nothing if not comprehensive and inclusive.  Vanderkam teaches theology at Notre Dame and Flint is co-director of the Dead Sea Scrolls Institute at Trinity Western University in British Columbia.  Together, they have produced a comprehensive and easy to read introduction to the subject.  They discuss the evidence and the controversies.  It is not a didactic tract seeking to make converts, though.  If you want an more emotional or intuitive experience of the words written down so long ago, a different text might be appropriate.<br />It starts with the discovery of the scrolls near Khirbet Qumran, tracing the various Bedouins, art dealers and scholars who identified the scrolls and brought them to world wide attention. We are then treated to a history of 'digs' near the discovery caves and a tentative outline of what we know from the physical evidence. This history includes the rather sad story of scroll deterioration since discovery.<br />With the physical evidence covered, the authors turn to a detailed review of what we think the scrolls actually say. Scholars think that most of the material represents copies of ancient text that served as 'source' for existent copies, the earliest of which was created about 400 AD.  Thus, all our traditional texts are relatively recent copies. In contrast, the DSS were created between 150 BC and 68 AD, 500 years earlier.  In essence, the DSS provide a way to 'check' on Jewish, Samaritan and Christian traditions for copying their theological references.<br />The next section reviews what we know about the 'community' responsible for the scrolls. At this point, the book becomes consciously speculative. The scrolls don't include a tour guide, so we really don't know who copied/wrote all this stuff. The most popular theory involves the Essenes, but the authors are careful to give voice to all the extant theories.<br />Finally, the book concludes with a review of implications (if any) on how scholars think the DSS relate to the Christian New Testament. The list includes theories the authors dismiss, but they do a good job of putting each theory in the best light possible. The book if nothing, if not inclusive.<br />\\"The Meaning of the Dead Sea Scrolls\\" will enrich your understanding of all ancient texts. There are no cataclysmic revelations, just a filling in of a few blanks, corrections for a few mistaken verse translations and confirmation of translation for others.  For me, it simply authenticates New Testament writings.  One doesn't have to take the New Testament commentary as gospel, but it definitely looks like an authentic product of the era between 25 - 100 AD.opied/wrote all this stuff.

I felt like I was sitting with a friend by a comfortable fire, being challenged to think, but regularly regaled with irony, satire and laughter. The motto of the book might be \\"The road is always better than the end.\\" Another theme is that seeking brings us together, that fulfills us.  The people who think they have found the final answer are the menace to our humanity, because there is no answer to find. Of course, this is the puzzle.  How can one maintain their interest in 'seeking' if they realize the danger of 'finding'? Boorstin doesn't provide simple answers.<br />Boorstin starts with the Biblical conversations with God recorded by the Jewish tradition.  To summarize these discussion, Boorstin spends a fair amount of time with the story of Job and the omnipresent fact that bad things happen to innocent people.  He concludes that the ancient Hebrews taught their children that no one knows what God knows, so the innocent must push on, must keep the faith.<br />With this said, he poses the same question (do you know what God knows?) to the Greek tradition, starting with Socrates.  Socrates became famous for demonstrating much the same point, interviewing those who claim to know truth, then proving their knowledge was an illusion.  Plato, Socrates admirer and evangelist, tried to answer Socrates with his utopian Republic.  In Plato's view, no one but philosophers knew the 'truth.'  Showing no respect for his elders, Aristotle, a student of Socrates and Plato, chose something of a middle road: scientists know a few things that are true.  In this triad of forceful personalities, the rest of the book finds it's structure.<br />Following Gibbon's outline of history, Boorstin then builds a bridge (Part II) between the ancient and modern world, quickly reviewing 1000 years of dialog between empiricists (the scientists who know at least one thing) and fundamentalists (those that know what God knows). This bridge involves Greek, then Christian evangelists, scholars and reformers until about 1500, when Hobbes, St. Thomas More and Descartes renew the Socratic debate.<br />Boorstin makes a case for the pivotal role Descartes plays, bridging the intuition and empiricist in his famous 'I think therefore I [know I] exist'. Descartes is followed by the evangelists of this synthesis: Voltaire (the civilized know) and Rousseau (the uncivilized know). The section on Rousseau is hilarious and well worth the price of the book  (The section on Kirkegaard is equally funny.)<br />Avoiding the temptation to side with any particular advocate, Part III describes a variety of utopian enthusiasts. For a while, I thought the title should have been the 'utopians'.  In these utopias, the old question about \\"God allowing bad thing to happen to innocent people\\" is solved by banishing suffering.  In Utopia, society is so perfected that nothing can upset the universal joy. The luminaries for this post 1800 era include Marx (historians know how to accomplish this), Kierkegaard (we will regret knowing), Lord Acton (joy through revolutionary discontinuities) and William James (knowledge is a river, impossible to divide). The last three personalities Boorstin mentions, Malraux, Bergson and Einstein seem to be Boorstin's personal favorites. They were all active during and after World War I & II and probably had an impact on his life. Only Voltaire gets similar approval.<br />Boorstin's favorable review of materialists like Voltaire, Marx and Malraux was a bit hard to swallow.. . He ignores the Scottish Enlightenment and Hume, where his hero Voltaire got the ideas which made him famous. Additionally, he tersely dismisses the contributions of Islamic, Hindu, Buddhist and Confucian philosophers, all of whom greatly enriched Europe.  It would have been better to ignore the subject.  But, the story telling is wonderful.

The connections are not obvious, and Schlosser doesn't make much of a case to link them. As such, I've spent more time puzzling over the links than reading the book itself.<br />It seems the stories outline America's curious method of managing consumer behavior and mass marketing practices. Schlosser doesn't consciously investigate mass marketing as a subject, but the technology of global marketing is the thread that holds these stories together.  By 'global marketing', I mean TV, radio, the internet, etc.  I also allude to the global distribution systems that companies like Wal-Mart, GM and Sony have established.<br />The technology of global marketing is designed to evoke consumer demand.  Consumers are trained to focus on specific brands by relentless repetition of inconsequential jingles, imagery and metaphors.  Despite our high opinion of 'free-will', we are creatures of habit and rarely think about those that manage our habits (except for mom, maybe).<br />This book is about the underbelly of the system.  Freedom of expression is a highly praised feature of American life, but can we let someone employ the technologies of mass advertising to sell cocaine and a evening at the brothel?<br />As every good American knows, the mass marketers must be controlled. The American solution is product criminalization (prohibition).  It is no coincidence that prohibition of alcohol and modern mass marketing emerge together in the late 19th century American experience.<br />In this light, the book is a set of case studies in American efforts to control global marketing of these 'too easy to sell' products.  The focus is our curious selective criminalization of producer/distribution roles.  In the case of (cheap) strawberries, the picker goes to jail.  In the case of marijuana, the middlemen get the longest jail sentences.  In the case of porn, the newly-rich get shut down by the 'establishment' and their lawyers.<br />This story can be told with statistics and theory, but that wouldn't sell many books.  Naylor has a nice book on the subject, Wages of Crime: Black Markets, Illegal Finance, and the Underworld Economy.  It has an Amazon ranking of about 285,000.  Not a best seller.  Schlosser has a different marketing plan and it seems to work.  Schlosser's book has an Amazon ranking of 80.<br />I call his technique 'Pulp Non-Fiction'. Schlosser retells each 'bust' (or non-bust) in terms of a Perils of Pauline plot line.  In the genre of 'true detective', he offers us the titillation of pulp-fiction with the moral righteousness of Upton Sinclair's 'The Jungle.' Injustice is the subject, corporations the villain and titillation the emotional thread.<br />I think there are a lot of people looking for a sense of what is creating a black market in America, but the sucker emotional narrative of this book is part of the problem.  It is the same sort of emotionalism that politicians use to get elected and mass marketers use to 'increase demand'. I doubt that many will put the pieces together and get more than the titillation value.<br />Don't get me wrong, the guy writes good pulp.  It's not a hard book to read.the newly-rich get shut down by the 'establishment' and their lawyers.<br />This story can be told with statistics and theory, but that wouldn't sell many books.

It ends with the Muslim conquest of Alexandria. In crude terms, it is what Gibbon called the 'fall of the Roman Empire.' Cuomo uses the 'Arch of Constantine' as a metaphoric reference. For most contemporary art historians, the arch is a pastiche of scavenged sculptures from earlier and finer artistic efforts. Scavenged is the key word here. The late-antiquity (according to Gibbon) was the moral equivalent of Sodom and Gomorrah.<br />I don't know how many people still take \\"Rome's Fall' as a moral litmus test, but I suspect the story still holds a lot of weight. It's this icon that Cuomo targets.<br />In general terms, I couldn't be more pleased with the project. Unfortunately, it doesn't really get off the ground. Cuomo isn't very forth coming on what she makes of the era. It seems she simply likes pastiche.<br />She starts her iconoclastic journey well, suggesting the subject of her book might never have existed. It is hard to argue the point. We know almost nothing about Pappus, the man. Unfortunately, the fictional Pappus concept seems to have been mentioned for shock value, and not pursued seriously. I would have been interested in hearing details on the process of putting mathematic lectures on scrolls for academic, social or bureaucratic purposes. Maybe ghost writing was a common practice. This emphasis on the 'media' itself seems critical to Cuomo's case (a role the Arch of Constantine served), but it is entirely ignored.<br />Cuomo then takes us down an entertaining bunny hole involving legal torture and highly paid astrologers. By taking this route, she hopes to convince us that mathematics was about as important to our late-classical delinquents as, well, ourselves. The legal discussion shows mathematical knowledge put one socially above those who could expect torture during any legal cross-examination. The astrological references show desperate young parents prayed for their off-spring to become mathematicians.<br />So far, so good, but Cuomo then launches into a book by book deconstruction of the works ascribed to Pappus (whoever he was), and in this the reader starts to wonder just what she wants to say. The less than stunning conclusion is that Pappus had careerist interests and said different things to target groups in hopes of enhancing his authority.<br />I was less than impressed.<br />One might surmise Cuomo has a bigger goal, but if it exists, it is very subtle. Of these subtle arguments, the chief seems to be that the standard historiography associates the development of Greek mathematics exclusively with Plato's philosophy (the Proclus (411-485) perspective). Cuomo points out contradictions in this line of reasoning made by Pappus (? 320 ?) and Iamblichus (250?-330?). In this, Cuomo hints at disputing the role of the Neo-Platonic synthesis. Proclus, as the heir to Plato's academy, plays a pivotal role in this. Cuomo seeks to uncover the real mathematician hidden by Proclus and later Neo-Platonic Christians.<br />If this is really what she hints at, I would be surprised. I am just grasping at straws...

Appropriate to this genre, the speculations are highly iconoclastic and experiments to collaborate the conclusions are easily imagined.<br />If you are looking for contradictions to 'classic' European narrative history, the book will please but could have been much shorter. A 30 page magazine article could get most of the points across.<br />I probably enjoy both lines of thought more than I should admit.<br />Unfortunately, the author fails to investigate the existing histories of the 'treasure ship' voyages. Rather than provide me with a commentary on his travels to distant sites while researching the book, I would have much preferred he argue the strengths of his case against those of other historians. The author acts like a lone reporter investigating a conspiracy of silence. While few English speakers profess much interest in Chinese history, the field is not a vacuum.<br />I wish the author knew more about the art of writing history. In summary, the book raises some interesting issues. If it had been written in the 'historical' genre rather than the 'extra-terrestrial' style, it might inspire more interest in Chinese history.	2003-05-24

Used copies are easily found online.  It reads like Tom Clancy, i.e., you won't be able to put it down.<br />I've heard a lot of people complain about bureaucracy, but this book does an excellent job of painting an exacting picture of the problem.  Gabriel argues that 3 issues produce American military failures:<br />1. Size of the officer corps (it is too big).<br />2. Rapid reassignment of officers (no one learns their job).<br />3. Self-promotion ( and self-serving bureaucracies).<br />4. Amateurism of political leadership.<br />The result is a lack of force preparedness and competent mission design.<br />Gabriel quotes a lot of numbers, so it is easy to check them.  I was surprised to discover the ratio of enlisted to officers had gotten worse since the books publication in 1985.  At publication, the ratio of enlisted to officers was about 7 to 1, it is now a little above 5 to 1.<br />Chapters on post-Viet Nam military operations make up the bulk of the book.  Each chapter represents a detailed look at the planning and execution of the operation.  Each operation is described as a failure in fact, if not political representation. The operations are:<br />1. Sontay Prison rescue attempt<br />2. The Mayaguez rescue attempt<br />3. The Iran rescue attempt<br />4. Peace keeping in Beirut<br />5. Grenada (rescue of students)<br />I am not comfortable with the concluding recommendations.  I  find them little more than tilting at wind-mills.  Gabriel recommends fewer officers, fewer promotions, fewer reassignments, and end to the Joint Chiefs of Staff bureaucracy.<br />Enjoy.	2003-05-18

First, we don't do a good job of attributing the correct proportion of random luck to skill in life's ups and downs. We assume our good fortune is skill and bad fortune is luck.  We don't split it down the middle, it is either luck or skill, not a blend. Taleb calls this probability blindness. Probability blindness is a term for our inability to maintain the existence of simultaneous realities.  The glass is about full or about empty.  It cannot be 'about full' and 'about empty' simultaneously.<br />Second, we forget the drop outs, and focus on the survivors.  Taleb calls this the 'Survivor bias'.  If you train a million monkeys to pound on a million typewriters for an infinite amount of time, one of them will write an exact duplicate of a Shakespeare sonnet. Still the 'surviving monkey' who produces a great sonnet has achieved this through pure luck..  The effort is entirely random. We are simply prone to attribute the 'one' monkey's success with skill, just because he was randomly chosen to have the winning lottery ticket.<br />In financial markets, a flim-flam stock broker uses the survivor bias to make big bucks.  He sends 5000 people a letter saying the market is going up, and 5000 a letter saying it will go down.  A month later, the 5000 recipients of the 'correct' letter, get a second letter.  Half get the up message, the other half get the down message. A month later, the 2500 recipients of the winning call get a third letter, 1250 up and 1250 down.  The 1250 who have now gotten 3 correct calls in a row, receive solicitations and 200 invest in the broker's offshore fund. The flim-flam man disappears with a million dollars.<br />Why do the 200 invest?  They forget that surviving the test does not imply skill.  They are fooled by randomness.<br />While interesting, this is not unfamiliar.  Taleb throws in a very useful twist, though.  He points out that knowing this doesn't insure  we do any better.  As Taleb puts it, 'my only advantage is my awareness of my frailty.'<br />The humility invoked here raises this book to an entirely more interesting level.  I was reminded of Thomas Merton's anti-biography, '7 Storied Mountain'. Like Merton, Taleb seems to spend more time contradicting himself and going on odd tangents.  For example, we are treated to a digression on honorable suicides and the sweet poetry people wrote to remember the practitioners.  In another section, we are advised to treat people as Martians because they become easier to ignore.  Like Merton, Taleb's style of delivery tells us more than the words alone can communicate, we must fumble through the paradoxes. This isn't a book on doing probability, its about developing humility.  There is no prescription for defeating our instincts, only advice for living with them.  In this, you find the best the book has to offer .<br />Taleb suggests he is tortured by probability.  It is not an 'interest,' it is an obsession. How refreshing an insight.  His drive doesn't come from 'reason', it comes from his emotional constitution. Not the sort of stuff you usually hear.ure  we do any better.

Manchester's 'The Last Lion, Winston Churchill' trys to make 19th century imperialism palatable by claiming it was over (Churchill was the last) and it's death-throes saved us happy non-imperialist types from Hitler.  Brzezinski uses the same \\"it's ok because it about over\\" trick. The concluding paragraph provides an excellent taste of the book's delights: \\"In the course of the next several decades, a functioning structure of global cooperation, based on geopolitical realities, could thus emerge and gradually assume the mantle of the world's current \\"regent,\\" which has for the time being assumed the burden of responsibility for world stability and peace. Geostrategic success in that cause would represent a fitting legacy of America's role as the first, only, and last truly global superpower.\\"<br />Here is what this means: At some unknown time, the United Nations will gradually take over the United States world regency. World regent America is 'ok' because the US will only do it for a few years and no one else will try it, again.<br />I guess Churchill wasn't the 'last lion,' after all.<br />After carefully hunting through the book, I don't think the 'temporary' side of imperialism is a serious concern for Brzezinski. His primary concern is insuring American power remains pre-eminent and American business monopolize it's 'regional sphere'. His method of operation involves catering to ethnic mythology at every turn, insuring a maximum of ethnic friction. The blandishments about an emerging 'structure of global cooperation' is just a fig leaf.<br />There must be a lot the left and right could complain about this vision, but I find it primarily empty headed. Brzezinski's model is the status quo, his style is crisis management. I felt like I was reading a paean to good old days of the 'Grand Game' and aristocratic diplomacy.<br />I won't go into the content. If you have played the board game Risk, you pretty much know what to expect. Brzezinski merely brings the 1960s game into the new millennium.<br />I think it useful to consider the book from two alternative views.  1) Has it offered predictive value?  2) Does it help us identify the forces that will influence the future.<br />On the first point, Brzezinski has no predictive powers. He doesn't peer into the future, he drives while staring at the rear view mirror. Written in the late 90s, he entirely misses the 'blowback' of his own Middle Eastern policy. In the late 70s, when Carter-era national security adviser, Brzezinski walked the Russians it \\"the Afghan trap.\\" Did he ever imagine that his creation, the mujahideen, would blow up the World Trade Center?Brzezinski's blind spot for Muslim creativity extends to just about everything south of the Alps, Anatolian plateau and Himalayas.

Drug cartels and non-government paramilitaries escape his radar screen.<br />On the second point, Brzezinski offers no systemic insights for global developments.  What is it about the United Nations that makes it a fit 'future' for global government?  What are the advantages of legitimizing the United Nations as the court of highest authority?

He is still trying to keep up with the kids and shares their distain for authority.  I wonder if Howard ever met an anarchist he didn't like.<br />So, we get to 'run with the pack' for a while.  It seems the kids are constructing a society of self-organizing, ad-hoc networks founded on wearable wireless computers, mediated by privacy protection algorithms.  Their networks are always on and location aware.  The computer is mutating into a universal remote-control wand and the purpose is having fun.<br />If it's not fun, the kids don't do it.  The kids find their friends via the internet, keep in touch via cell phones and turn the city into a game board with GPS. It is all amazing and new.<br />What does it mean?  It means more \\"wealth, knowledge and civil society\\".  There will be new forms of \\"sex, commerce, entertainment and conflict.\\"  The danger comes from the adult crowd, the 'big brother' bureaucracies that will want to redirect all this creativity into a straight-jacket.<br />It seems the decision we have to make involves our use of the 'commons', or in modern parlance, the 'internet'.  Will we allow the 'free riders' to sink the ship?  Will we allow the fence builders to steal our playground?<br />To engage in the debate, Rheingold does a good job of teaching enough chaos theory to make sense of the issues.  You might get tired of him invoking the prisoner's dilemma and 'swarm intelligence', but they are interesting ideas.  It's a bit thin, but the book is rushing through so many gadgets, inventors and theories that I didn't mind.<br />Personally, I'm not sure there is anything 'new' to be invented about sex and entertainment.  The most important exploration is the discovery of self.  'Sex, commerce, entertainment and conflict' may provide ever changing milestones in that journey, but I doubt our experience of despair and wonder are any different than they were 1000 years ago. Would a network of wearable computers help Hamlet make up his mind?  Would Hamlet have wanted assistance?  Additionally, the reader ought to be aware that the themes elucidated by Rheingold: 1) interconnectedness, 2) compression of time and 3) demassification are commonly used in defense department articles on the 'modern warrior'.  It's not all fun and games.wearable computers help Hamlet make up his mind?  Would Hamlet have wanted assistance?

It is divided into two sections, 'Epiphany' and 'Diaspora'. Few will need an introduction to notions of a Scottish diaspora, but 'epiphany' is an interesting twist on 'Enlightenment'. The conventional academic gloss on the Enlightenment focuses on French appeals to 'reason' culminating in Kant's categorical truths. The followers of Edmund Burke generally dismiss the 'French Enlightenment' as a corruption of the British Enlightenment which focused on 'compassion' rather than 'reason'.<br />Herman takes both to task for forgetting the evangelical sources of our modern world. Herman starts his story with crusty John Knox and his blend of revolutionary violence, predestination and universal literacy. Knox's reliance on the whirling dervish of 'revival meetings' and individual study of biblical sources provides Herman with all he needs to found the enlightened modern world in foggy Scotland. He is not shy about introducing Christian roots to what became an atheist philosophy. The transition from spiritual epiphany to materialist enlightenment might have been an interesting thread, but Herman avoids the issue. It is enough to boost the Scottish role and leave it at that.<br />Personally, I found this all a bit more intriguing than convincing. The leap from Knox (1505 - 1572) to Francis Hutcheson (1694-1746) required a detour from church history into British nationalism before emerging with a secular history of the Enlightenment. While I enjoyed getting a Scottish view of the 'English' civil war and detailed account of parliamentary debate over the Treaty of Union (1707), I was left wondering if the emphasis on Knox was merely Scottish boosterism, i.e. the Scots invented everything, so we need a 16th century Scot founder. . The genesis story is to short. All this takes place in the first 60 pages, one third of it devoted entirely to the Treaty of Union. To make a case for Hutcheson and Lord Kames inventing the 'Enlightenment', a bit more would be required regarding English and French developments.<br />Don't get me wrong, I really didn't mind the boosterism. The story moves pretty quickly. Just read it with a skeptical eye, as any Scot would advise you.<br />Others might say that the book is a much needed hurrah for the Lowland Scots. Given the 19th century's romantic obsession with the Highland clans, the Lowland Scots get ignored or labeled traitors. Herman enjoys debunking these delusions. The Highlanders are simply barbarian holdouts from the feudal age, the truly unenlightened. He gleefully recounts the adulteration of highland kilt into royal mini-skirt, and describes the rising of 1745 as little more than suicidal lunacy. Most tellingly, the highland clans are Lord Kames' model for 'primative man' and thus the model for later notions of 'hunter-gatherer' societies. The lowland Scots provide the heroic model of social elevation from 'hunter-gather' to 'farmer' to 'merchant' to 'enlightened'.<br />I enjoyed the way Herman connects Knox to Hutcheson, then Hutcheson to Hume, Witherspoon and the American revolution. It is a good story and fine corrective to the conventional emphasis on continental philosophy.

The author has not divorced his personal identity from his logic. The title seems a bit misleading, but probably intentionally so. Nitschke wants to be sure no one mistakes his desire to put passion back in philosophy. Perhaps Nitschke has reworked 'dispassionate knowledge' into 'silent orgasm.' Dispassionate knowledge seems safe and familiar. The same cannot be said for 'silent orgasm,' but how different are the two terms?<br />Nitchke asks if we can ever separate knowledge and passion. Prior to Kant and the rise of university philosophers, the passions were always understood to be essential to the search for knowledge. Descartes names wonder as the first of the passions, a prerequisite for any learning. The passion of wonder has always been described by scientists and mathematicians as the heart of their experience of knowledge. Philip Fisher in the Vehement Passions claims a similar role for anger, fear, grief, and shame. Thus Nitschke's comments are in stark contrast to the idealism of Plato and Kant, where the passions preclude clear thought and 'true' knowledge.<br />Nitschke evokes an understanding of knowledge in terms of meditation, but illuminates 'meditation' in active and passive forms. Using the metaphor of 'hunting', he suggest mankind has long had two styles of seeking knowledge. The hunter can 'chase' the prey or 'be still' and let the prey come to the hunter. Examining these two methods of hunting knowledge, their reliance upon each other and apparent differences, occupies most of the book.<br />Rather than focus on 'knowledge' as an object or fact, Nitschke grounds his comments upon an assumption that our personal nature cannot be frozen or objectified for personal study. Thus, the existence of the unknowable must be accepted as one of the 'knowns'. The gap between known and unknowable becomes the hunting ground for knowledge. He reviews the Vedanta, Bardo, Yoga and Zen models of consciousness and then contrasts them with Western models. He finds the Western models delusionary.<br />With the Western models cast aside in favor of a more dynamic and individualized sense of knowledge, Nitschke begins a somewhat Socratic discussion of the relationship between knowledge and orgasm, using tantric ritual for road signs along the journey.consciousness and then contrasts them with Western models.

US	52485851	R10JIQSFTPPPD0	0743234359	512466969	American Jihad: The Terrorists Living Among Us	Books	4	28	39	N	N	Ok, so what is to be done?	This is a difficult book to read.  Like other reporters on confusing issues that cannot be ignored, we are treated to something of a buffet of facts with limited organizing principle.  For example, the dust jacket attempts to raise the celebrity of Mr. Emerson by noting his 1997 comment that \\"If anything, the threat [of a World Trade Center attack] is greater now than before.  The infrastructure now exists to carry off twenty simultaneous World TradeCenter-type [truck] bombings across the United States\\".<br />The quote displays the strengths and weaknesses of the book.  Mr. Emerson is correct that something is incredibly wrong, but the danger is as mysterious as ever.  The American terrorist network has proven to support a continuous wave of equivalent bombings in Israel, not the United States.  Rather than pulling off 20 simultaneous US truck bombings, the infrastructure pulled on a single attack that was 100 times worse than the 1991 truck bomb.<br />Emerson really never gets down to the fundamentals of terrorizing populations. Instead, he adopts the familiar  'reporters' perspective to organize his comments.  The first two chapters are autobiographical.  He simply explains how he got 'hooked' on tailing the Jihad.  The justifications are not really satisfying, since his initial motivation seemed careerist rather than principled.  The fuming Muslim Jihadis seemed a good candidate for a long term writing job.<br />But, the autobiographic theme is then blended into the 'eye witness reporter' perspective.  The internal self-inspection falls away and Mr. Emerson reports on his adventures while interviewing various mullahs and warlords who he is convinced will kill him if they only knew what he was up to.  The story is somewhat surreal and diffused.  The terrorists seem to suffer from an odd bi-polar disorder, being a courteous host in public, but dwelling in the sewers of murder when out of our author's sight.<br />Perhaps knowing he has to deliver some sort of criminal conviction if he wanted to satisfy the reader, we are then told a detailed story of a terrorist recruiter, then of a terrorist trainee.  Unfortunately, Mr. Emerson has to acknowledge that both are only 'linked' to terror organizations.  Mr. Emerson cannot accuse either of specific crimes.<br />And, there in lies the real pain for the reader.  We are left hanging.  What is to be done?  Change US laws?  Go to war?  Close the borders?  Start a civil defense program? Or, ignore it because it's just a bad dream that will go away...<br />Based on my own reading between the lines, Osama Bin Laden's bombing of the World Trade Towers is the aberration that threatens to spoil the party.  The US is the training ground and a major funding source for Islamofascist operations everywhere else!  Hamas is probably just as interested in taking down Bin Laden as Bush.  The guy is screwing up a sweet deal with an American bureaucracy whose only real interest is preserving the status-quo.<br />Unfortunately, this is a message unlikely to cause many Americans to awaken with any sense of purpose.<br />Rather than trot out the 'usual suspects' and the traditional plot line, I would rather Emerson had taken the next step and outlined the bigger picture.  Maybe this was not his purpose.  Maybe he just wanted to cause his reader to think.  Maybe his publisher just wanted to take advantage of huge wave of fear caused by the World Trade Center.<br />As a country, we are losing the war.  It isn't lost, but the real problem is our inability to define the threat.  Americans continue to define security in terms of very expensive mobility and weapons systems.  The World Trade Center attack cost only a few hundred thousand to mount.  The American response has be to divert billions to massive technological control systems and more billions to transport a conventional army (control system) to the middle east.<br />We have been pouring billions down a rat hole over the so-call 'war on drugs'.  Are Americans doomed to  pour the last billions down the drain on a misguided 'war on terror'?  It would be helpful if Emerson had addressed the American 'way' in terms of dealing with what should really be called 'NetWar'. What should the response be to network terrorists who are infrastructure parasites rather than competitors?  What is the cost? Who should manage the effort?<br />Mr. Emerson gets high marks for laying the ground work, but he failed to lay out the battle lines in understandable terms.e Americans doomed to  pour the last billions down the drain on a misguided 'war on terror'?

I described it to my wife as the 'People Magazine history of Alexandria.'  The focus is on celebrities, money, murders and sensations.  Not an entirely bad place to spark an interest in this subject.<br />The 196 pages are divided up into 33 chapters.  Each chapter covers 2 or 3 celebrities of Alexandrian history.  That allows the author only about a page per luminary, so it has to move pretty quickly.  The first hundred years (330 to 230 BC) get 90 pages.  The next 200 get only 40 (230 BC to 30 AD). After that, there is little on the library itself, only the Alexandrian fin-de-siecle told as soap opera.<br />Of course, Flower's 'decline' story (30 to 642 AD) is the subject of some debate.  Flower's write that the Caliph Umar used the following logic to justify burning the library's books: &quot;If what is written in them agrees with the Book of God, they are not required; if it disagrees, they are not desired.  Destroy them therefore,&quot;.  The modern 'Bibliotheca Alexandrina' website asserts the Christians destroyed the library 200 years before the Muslims got there.<br />For a deeper look, see<br />The Vanished Library: A Wonder of the Ancient World, Canfora<br />Pappus of Alexandria and the Mathematics of Late Antiquity, Cuomo<br />The Library of Alexandria: Centre of Learning in the Ancient World, Macleod	2003-01-17

In the year 712, Muslims brought multi-culturalism to Spain. The resulting golden-age of tolerance was ended by Catholic bigotry, lies and murders. The book retells Spanish history in terms of crimes against the Spanish Jewish people (people who practiced the Jewish faith and those whose Spanish ancestors were Jewish but practiced Catholic Christianity themselves). Particular attention is given to the anti-Jewish riots of 1391 and inquisition, but these events are linked to more contemporary Catholic crimes.<br />I found the details of Spanish history interesting. This period is particularly ugly to our modern sensibility and English speaking historians seem to avoid it. For example, Queen Isabella looks like a good candidate for modern feminist biography. She created one of the first modern states and financed the first European adventures in the Western Hemisphere. Despite this, the Amazon website has only 1 post-1950 biography on her. I suspect her role in establishing the Spanish inquisition seems decidedly un-feminist.<br />I don't recommend this book. The author naively accepts various first person accounts from the era when they support her case. At one point, she retells the miraculous story of Jewish children having visions of Christian crosses entirely without a modern skepticism. It simply happened. Less sentimental was her naive acceptance of the racist premise that being a 'converso' (Spanish Catholics with a Jewish ancestor) had some sort of biological reality.  Somehow, the persecution of these Christians was a crime against the Jewish race because the biological reality of race was more important than the details of faith.<br />The conventional wisdom on the Spanish Inquisition, (see B. Netanyahu's \\"The Origins of the Inquisition in Fifteenth-Century Spain\\") takes the view that the Spanish sovereigns let the 'coversos' be attacked in order to distract the outraged city masses and their leaders from turning against the royal establishment itself.  In other words, it was a media campaign to control the 'masses' via propaganda.  For example, King Ferdinand himself was a 'converso', but he continually used the inquisition to suppress opposition to his innovations in tax policy.<br />The 'revisionist' view (see The Spanish Inquisition: A Historical Revision by H.Kamen) suggests the modern understanding of the inquisition is Marxist propaganda of the 20th century.  If you can take this perspective for a moment, the fact Paris ignores the 13th century expulsion of Jews from Muslim Spain suggests Paris fits Kamen's critique.

You will read about the risks he and his colleagues take with their careers.  You will read about the incredible inertia in academia.  But, you won't find much insight into the principles of network dynamics?<br />I'm not sure the book delivers.  We get a 'report from the field', but not much detail or general understanding.  It's all too confusing and new, if I caught Barabasi's drift.<br />But, is this a good 'introduction' to network dynamics?  Based on the reviews here, it seems clear the prose appeals to many readers.  If this inspires people to read more, then great.  I am afraid they are attracted by the comforting tone and soothing outlook, though.  We get too much of Barabasi, the expert grant writer.  Barabasi foresees network dynamics leading us to Kurzweil's happy 'Age of Spiritual Machines'.  A more down to earth view suggests networks bring us Osama Bin Laden.  Barabasi is quite thrilled to find small world dynamics in his network research, but never connects them to the 'small world dynamics' of drug lords and suicide bombers.<br />I'm a bit puzzled by Barabasi's problems with the details.  For example, he does a poor job of explaining exactly what a 'power-law' distribution might be, though he uses the term over and over, again. How does one 'find' a power-law in experimental data?  Most people have probably gone through much of their lives never seeing a single one! If you find one, will anyone agree with you?<br />Offering a few examples that one could work with at home would go a long way.  For instance, Barabasi talks about the way wealth approximates a power-law distribution.  If you try to work with published data on this subjects, there won't be much that looks like a power-law.  In fact, the whole idea is rather controversial.  It confounds our intuitions and sense of what is right.  A power-law distribution of wealth has a few rich, a few more at the 'middle income' level and huge masses in the 'poor' bracket. We would rather have income distributed according to a 'bell curve', a few rich, a few poor and most 'middle class.' If you want to claim 1) natural is 'good', 2) power-laws are 'natural',  and 3)  wealth has a power-law distribution, why complain about a vanishing middle class?

I thought the comment of an earlier review's title, 'A Perfect Complement to an academic finance text!' fairly accurate.  If you want to know what the talking heads on the financial news are touting, this is an excellent guide.<br />In other words, if you have bought into the conventional econometrics of the day, whatever that is, this is your guidebook. It ought to help get through a class, but outside the ivory tower, I'm not sure it will be much help.<br />Personally, the author didn't help me connect the dots.  What do these indicators imply for the GNP 2, 3 or 4 years down the road?  What connections do foreign indicators have with domestic ones?<br />These questions are not answered.  It's just a dictionary.  You get the nominal description, the publishing authority, a bit about why the authority thinks their indicator useful and maybe a few sample numbers.  That is it.  If you like academic economics or ever have to make a presentation to some government officials, this is probably an exceptional service, though.	2002-08-23

If you spend your time reading this, you won't learn anything about taking care of assets.  All you learn is the standard Wall Street diatribe:<br />1. No one can predict the market (except for Wall Street Professionals)<br />2. The biggest mistake you can make is taking your money out of stocks and bonds once they are deposited (except to pay your advisor).<br />3. Don't trust your instincts, trust your Wall Street professional's instincts.<br />At the end of the book, probably hoping they have convinced their reader of his utter ignorance regarding money management, they kindly offer a chapter on finding your 'financial advisor', closing with their own email  mailing addresses.<br />Guess what you are supposed to do.<br />The book is full of odd contradictions.<br />1. It's title proudly claims to be about 'beating' Wall Street, but the conclusion extols reliance on a 'financial advisor'.<br />2. For the first 3 chapters, the authors claim to accept 'random walk' theories, and points out the inability of top ranked fund managers to maintain their ranking as proof of the randomness of the market.  For the remainder of the book, we are constantly advised only a professional can distinguish a long term positive rate of return.  In other words, it's not a random walk.  The guy's picking your asset class funds can suddenly defeat the random walk.<br />3. There is a chapter on defining your financial goals, but when determining your 'investment time frame', the authors advise using your life expectancy. Let me explain this to you. They advise putting your money in a Wall Street fund and updating your will.  You should never plan on 'cashing out' and enjoying your rewards. That's pretty safe investment advice, if the client is alive, the money should stay put and the plan is still on track, even if it is down 70%.  If he's dead, he won't sue over the bad advice.<br />4. In chapter 6 and 7, they advise ignoring tax implications.  Chapter 8 is on investing with taxes in mind.<br />5. In the intro, the authors promise to show you how to do the math yourself.  At the end of the book, there is just a bunch of formulas that refer to other formulas with values left undefined.  I guess they figured no one was going to follow the math, and if they would, they were not their type of client, anyway.pter 6 and 7, they advise ignoring tax implications.

It appears to be 500 pages of minutia. In fact, the author starts out by saying it is an expansion of a footnote to an early work on the relatively obscure Calvinist mathematician Wallis. How perfectly academic! If that doesn't put the book out of reach, look forward to reading about 1000 footnotes.<br />Regardless, I think this a great book. Once I got comfortable with the terms, I realized this might be construed as something much more interesting than the traditional 'discovery' of mathematical truths. I'm still not exactly sure how to characterize it, but I'm having fun thinking it a history of science fiction. After all, 'squaring the circle' is the 17th century equivalent to predicting the winner of the Kentucky Derby or tomorrow's change in the Dow Jones Industrials. I may be stretching a bit here, but there is clearly more on the plate than justifying 17th century mathematic revolutions with apples falling on the head of a reclining Newton.<br />Rather than placing the subject matter in purely mathematical terms, Jesseph considers his material in a wider context, one that makes room for Restoration style science fiction. Keep in mind that Newton's alchemy was an early form of teleportation and the monads of Leibnitz took advantage of an early warp drive. Despite overtly humiliating Hobbs for his mathematical errors, its clear that Jesseph finds Hobbs the ultimate winner. Hobbs suffers no more from his lapse of academic rigor than any contemporary science fiction author. And like Jules Verne, the spirit of his ideas has won if not his details. The political science advocated by Hobbs in Leviathan is hard to distinguish from contemporary standards. Hobbs advocated severely limiting the legal authority of church bishops, scientific materialism and the notion that good laws could produce a good society. Meanwhile, Wallis would be known as a dogmatic right-wing Christian fundamentalist. Further, most of us are convinced that science has 'solved' the problem of 'squaring the circle' which is all Hobbs was advocating, anyway.<br />And so, Jesseph does a subtle job of indicting my modern sensibility. Painting Hobbs to be the fool, he is actually pointing a finger at my happy secular humanism. Bravo!<br />So, why is squaring the circle so tricky?<br />In short, an attempt to find the circle which is exactly 1 square foot in area forces us to confront conflicting intuitions about how we prove the existence of 'real' objects. Try it out for yourself. It is something you can attempt with pencil and paper, or better... try it with a home computer. One of the great things about this book is that it lays out the mathematical issues clearly enough that anyone with high school algebra and maybe an ability to write an excel spreadsheet, can play the 17th century geometer and mathematician. I had a great time doing a 'quadrature' in Excel. If you are interested, I'll email you the spreadsheet (see users.htcomp.net/markmills).<br />In summary, I think Jessup's book fits into a broad, ongoing reappraisal of mathematical history. I can identify 3 trends, 'Squaring the circle belonging to the 3rd and most important of them:<br />1. Bringing non-western mathematics to western readers. The best of this is the ongoing research into ancient Chinese mathematics. See 'Chinese Mathematics: A Concise History', Li Yan, Du Shiran, John N. Crossley, Anthony W.-C. Lun, Shih-Jan Tu or 'Astronomy and Mathematics in Ancient China: The Zhou Bi Suan Jing', Christopher Cullen. In short, most of what the Europeans called 'new' math in the 1500s had been around for 500 years in China.<br />2. Finding a physiological basis for mathematic intuitions. Check out the cognitive research described by 'Where Mathematics Comes From: How the Embodied Mind Brings Mathematics into Being', George Lakoff, Rafael E. Nunez, Rafael Nu&ntilde;ez. All you really need to read is the first chapter. The rest israther speculative.<br />3. Reappraising the conventional myths about heroic ancient European mathematicians. Unless your ambition is a tenured job teaching the history of math, you will have a great time reading sensible inquiries into pre-modern western math. Take a look at 'Biographies of Scientific Objects , Lorraine Daston (Editor), or Pappus of Alexandria and the Mathematics of Late Antiquity, Serafina Cuomo.ather speculative. <br />3.

I've read the book, but plan to make a second pass at a much slower pace.  I may bounce the rating up to 5 when I get done.  For now, the book gets a 4.<br />I like the book a great deal.  In particular, I really like Headley's highlighting of sentiment indicators.  At the end of the book, he shares a summation of his trading discipline.  Much of it is a quick summary 'The Disciplined Trader' by Mark Douglas.  The readers would be well advised to read Douglas directly, but if the material is new, it ought to be worth the price of the book by itself.  For me, I enjoyed the insight into Headley's life style.<br />Headley's writing style strikes me as somewhat 'stream of consciousness', though.  For example, while discussing his use of the Put/Call ratio, he states: &quot;The next put/call signal occurs on February 16th, when the put/call ratio crossed back below the upper band to register a 49 percent reading on February 16th, after a 55 percent number occurred the prior day (February 15th).  What you notice in this example is that the put/call ratio then has another surge above the upper band two days later, on February 18th at 63 percent.  What should be done in these situations?  Since a bullish position is already established, you should seek to follow the indicator and stay with the signal until it is either reversed by a sell signal (which would only occur at the other extreme, below the lower band, usually after a rally) or if the time is up for the trade (in the bullish case, after 15 trading days).  As you can see in this case, ....&quot;<br />Along side these blow by blow trading commentaries, Headley presents the TradeStation EasyLanguage code for mechanically trading the QQQ based on sentiment readings.<br />Why go into these daily details if he is just following a set of rules? Rather than spend time on the day by day commentary, I wish Headley had discussed the process of picking parameters for his trading system.  Why 15 days for the long position but only 2 for the short? Additionally, without going through the day by day commentary with a fine tooth comb, I'm not sure he isn't bringing in extra considerations outside those in his mechanical trading system.<br />Ditto for the divergence discussion.<br />If you happen to be a TradeStation user, the code provided in the book won't run on the current version (TS 6).  It's not that hard to up date, but don't expect to type the code into TS 6 and expect it to run.  Also, the TradeStation datafeed doesn't offer the CBOE put/call ratio, nor convenient means of getting into the system, so it is a bit hard to try put/call ratio ideas out.Why 15 days for the long position but only 2 for the short?

This is not just about China, this is about the human condition.  Someone with an imagination should have worked on the title and given it a bit more excitement. I almost skipped reading the book because the title seemed so dry.<br />I read this book twice and will probably read it, again.  The author's presentation is simply masterful.  Step by step, he recreates the setting and background for the book's creation and utilization.  In fact, he walks the reader through about 2000 years of 'uses' that people found for the book.  According to Cullen, this classic was probably a gift to a Chinese emperor and then dumped in a back room for 200 years.  It was only when political circumstances changed and an 'old' book might be valuable that it was 'rediscovered' and rendered useful.<br />For anyone interested in the practice of ancient astronomy, Cullen goes into great detail on the tools and practice of Chinese astronomers from about 3000 BC to the arrival of Jesuits in 1600.  For anyone interested in Chinese political history, Cullen explores imperial Chinese history in a way that simply makes one want to read much, much more.  For anyone interested in ancient Chinese record keeping, Cullen offers practical advice on what to make of the 'documents' we moderns discover.<br />I hope they make this a paperback so that it can get wider circulation.  What is commonly called 'the history of math' is often embarrassingly western (ethno-centric). This book offers a means of correcting that unfortunate state of affairs.	2002-07-21

Standard ARIMA (autoregressive models) which are closest to familiar linear regression techniques.<br />2. Neural nets and Bayesian trees (as a category called 'relational data mining' by the authors)<br />3. Fuzzy logic approaches (described as 'membership functions'.  Membership functions are defined in terms of linguistic practice, whatever that is.).<br />In this way, the authors develop a seemingly comprehensive outline of the field, describing fields of study in terms of increasing abstraction. Of the three, I found the fuzzy logic discussion the most interesting.<br />I have to express some reservations regarding the perspective taken by the authors. Their view is that of the Newtonian physicist observing the interactions of bodies entirely independent of the viewer. At no point do the authors examine the implication of 'self participation' in the marketplace. For example, what happens to probability distribution 'X' when a trading entity uses the probability distribution 'X' to take a significant position in a security?  If this seems interesting, you might try looking at &quot;Theory of Financial Risks: From Statistical Physics to Risk Management&quot;, by Bouchaud or &quot;An Introduction to Econophysics: Correlations and Complexity in Finance&quot; by Mantegna and Stanley.	2002-06-30

Generally, I try to avoid terms like 'classic' and 'essential', but they keep coming to mind.<br />The original was written in the mid 1930s.  As Klein writes in this version's preface, \\"This study was originally written and published in Germany during rather turbulent times.\\"<br />The late Jacob Klein spent his post war years teaching Platonic philosophy at St. John's College.  There, he was known as something of a lovable elitist.  Professors tell a story about Klein being partial to the number 12.  He claimed that there were an exclusive 12 philosophers, 7 Greek and 5 German.  The word got out and he soon received a letter from 4,000 American philosophers begging to differ with his opinion.<br />While many might call this book 'philosophy of math,' I doubt Dr. Klein would agree.  The book is without much in the way of serious math.  It is more concerned with the symbols of math and how they are used.  Quoting from the first paragraph of the introduction:<br />\\"Creation of a formal mathematical language was of decisive significance for the constitution of modern mathematical physics. If the mathematical presentation is regarded as a mere device, preferred only because the insights of natural science can be expressed by \\"symbols\\" in the simplest and most exact manner possible, the meaning of the symbolism as well as of the special methods of the physical disciplines in general will be misunderstood. True, in the seventeenth and eighteenth century it was still possible to' express and communicate discoveries concerning the \\"natural\\" relations of objects in non mathematical terms, yet even then -or, rather, particularly then - it was precisely the mathematical form, the mos geometricus, which secured their dependability and trustworthiness. After three centuries of intensive development, it has finally become impossible to separate the content of mathematical physics from its form. The fact that elementary presentations of physical science which are to a certain degree nonmathematical and appear quite free of presuppositions in their derivations of fundamental concepts (having recourse, throughout, to immediate \\"Intuition\\") are still in vogue should not deceive us about the fact that it is impossible, and has always been impossible, to grasp the meaning of what we nowadays call physics independently of its mathematical form. Thence arise the insurmountable difficulties in which discussions of modern physical theories become entangled as soon as physicist or nonphysicists attempt to disregard the mathematical apparatus and to present the results of scientific research in popular form. The intimate connection of the formal mathematical language with the content of mathematical physics stems from the special kind of conceptualization which is a concomitant of modern science and which was of fundamental importance in its formation.\\"<br />While this iconoclastic promise is a bit difficult to extract from the somewhat professional philosophic prose, there is a wonderful essay in \\"Biographies of Scientific Objects,\\" edited by Lorraine Daston that serves as an excellent commentary.  The essay called \\"Mathematical Entities in Scientific Discourse\\" credits Klein with a new perspective from which to interpret the transition of ancient and medieval traditions to the new mathematical physics of the seventeenth century. His was the seemingly narrow-but only deceptively so-perspective of the ancient concept of \\"arithmos\\", compared to the concept of number in its modern, symbolic sense. In Klein's own words, the underlying thematics of the book never loses sight of the \\"general transformation, closely connected with the symbolic understanding of number, of the scientific consciousness of later centuries.\\"<br />Although the Greek conceptualization of mathematical objects was indeed based upon the notion of arithmos, this notion should not be thought of as a conceptof \\"general magnitude.\\" It never means anything other than \\"a definite number of definite objects,\\" or an \\"assemblage of things counted\\". Likewise, geometric figures and curves, commensurable and incommensurable magnitudes, ratios, have their own special ontology which directs mathematical inquiry and its methods.<br />In contradistinction to Greek parlance, \\"general magnitude,\\" according to Klein, is clearly a modern concept.  Proving this case is the project of both books.<br />I think you will find reading this material an interesting journey.ept of \\"general magnitude.\\" It never means anything other than \\"a definite number of definite objects,\\" or an \\"assemblage of things counted\\".

Obviously, I didn't like this book, but I'm exceptionally biased.  I'll try to make my reaction understandable to those I imagine finding this book attractive.<br />First,I was offended by the title itself.  'Behavioral Finance' is an important area of economic research.  Leading books in the field include The Winner's Curse by Richard H. Thaler , Advances in Behavioral Finance, Thaler (editor) and Inefficient Markets: An Introduction to Behavioral Finance (Clarendon Lectures in Economics),  by Andrei Shleifer.  The basic argument of Thaler and Shleifer involves what has come to be known as efficient market theory.  Advocates of 'behavioral finance' have been attacking the efficient market hypothesis for 20 years without making much headway in academia.  Now, everyone knows markets are ineffienct, just look at the ability of corporate America to buy political advantage, but you won't find that taught in 'higher' institutions of learning.<br />Now, this little book seems to be doing a nice volume of business by usurping the name by which Thaler, Shleifer and others have been working under for 20 years.  Does Goldberg offer any credit to the trail blazers?  No.  This is simply Goldburg and von Nitzsch's personal effort.  In the context of previous efforts in Behavioral Finance, the authors ramble on and on without making any useful points. They do not offer any insights to the body of behavioral finance research.  They try to talk as if they know something about trading, but at best their experiences are those of an amateur. The book has none of the rigor I expect from the field.<br />If the book had been titled, 'Psychology of financial agents,' I would have been non-pulsed.  The psychology of financial agents is a fascinating field and perhaps the material in this book has respectable insights into psychology.  For example, the author's comments on the 'triune brain' seem an interesting insight into human psychology.  The authors conclude there are three kinds of investors: the 'gut person', the 'heart person' and the 'head person'. Goldberg and von Nitzsch's take on psychology isn't mine, but it certainly fits under the umbrella of traditional psychology.

Version 7 is on the horizon.  Ask Mr. EasyLanguage is largely based on Version 4, making only editorial insert comments about Version 5 (TS 2000i).  With this in mind, the code contained in the book is probably not going to run without significant modification.  Several of the key issues raised by the book, notably 'IncludeSystem' and the 64k code limit, are no longer of interest.  IncludeSystem is no longer a key word.  The 64k code limit has been erased.<br />All this in mind, I still found the book a useful resource.  It represents a glimpse into the 'Easylanguage' mindset.  I really couldn't point to any one phrase or topic which was individually enlightening, but from time to time, there was a moment of 'Oh, I see what those EasyLanguage programmers were doing!'<br />I don't think you can get that anywhere else.

I picked up this book after reading various doom-and-gloom essays about 2002 politics in Zimbabwe. I thought the book might offer something other than a political diatribe from one party line or another.<br />I was right about the lack of political commentary. For a while, it looked like it would have very little to say about Africa, at all. On one level, it is just the memoir of private family tragedy from the perspective of a 5 year old.  The dedication page reads \\"to Mum, Dad, and Vanessa and to the memory of Adrian, Olivia and Richard with love\\". So, from page one, I was asking myself, who were Adrian, Olivia and Richard? Why did they die? Given this is touted as a 'war story,' I figured it involved battle deaths, but no, it's all family tragedy, stuff that could happen anywhere.<br />The author constantly maintains the voice of appropriate maturity to the age she experienced the episode. Often, this is accomplished by stringing together olfactory metaphors. The following is from page 3. The episode is titled 'Rhodesia, 1975.' The auther is 6.<br />\\"So if I wake in the night and need Mum and Dad, I call Vanessa, because she isn't armed. \\"Van! Van, hey!\\" I hiss across the room until she wakes up. And then Van has to light a candle and escort me to the loo, where I pee sleepily into the flickering yellow light and Van keeps the candle high, looking for snakes and scorpions and baboon spiders. ... the breeze has trapped midday scents; the prevalent cloying of the leach field, the green soap which has spilled out from the laundry and landed on the patted-down red earth, the wood smoke from the fires that heat our water, the boiled meat smell of dog food. We debate the merits of flushing the loo.\\"<br />This is a good example of how the author weaves the 'war' into a story of childhood memories. It is just part of the landscape. She can't go get in bed with her parents because her Dad might shoot whoever startles him.<br />With this protective screen of childhood innocence and family tragedy, we are offered a glimpse of what it is like to be an African. I hope no one minds me calling the author an African. Deciding whether of not she is African seems to be the internal debate that strings together the episodes. That's what I was looking for and I appreciate the journey.<br />I would have edited out the last 30 pages. There is no need to tidy up the loose threads to the story and the author un-wisely abandons her style of speaking from the 'era.'

If you wanted to know how computers work, if you really wanted to get you hands down into the guts of the machine and be master of that virtual universe, there was nothing like assembly.<br />It is still cool, but hardly popular. The popularity faded during the 80s and almost vanished in the 90s. Assembly language became very esoteric, the domain of a priviledged few. Many of them doing odd things like building defense department weapons where size restraints still made assembly critical and money for a slow programming process was plentiful.<br />According to Dunteman, Linux is changing that all. Linux is a clean slate, a beath of fresh air for programmers. With Linux, the average Joe can get the same thrills that were available in the 70s.

This book did an excellent job of getting me through the setup process successfully and teaching me something in the process.<br />I decided to 'learn' Linux a few weeks ago and brought this book home for a 'weekend install' project.  The book is perfectly designed for this kind of project. The book walks you though the setup process, step by step.  I now have a fully operating Linux machine with an XWindows graphic interface.  Not bad, in my opinion.<br />I very much liked the author's attention to detail and accurate anticipation of what I would encounter during the project. For example, one of the first steps the author demands of the reader is backing up everything you currently have on your machine.  A few hours later, that back up became very important.  Sure, everyone should think of that, but it certainly wasn't on my mind as I got started. A host of little things like that made the book work.<br />Additionally, there is an adequate amount of 'introduction to UNIX/Linux shell commands.'  This taught me enough UNIX to figure out a few problems on my own.  Every computer system is a bit different, so a 'single' list of instructions just isn't going to help everyone through the set up.  My multiple SCSI hard drive setup took me off the 'normal' track (the book is written for someone with a single IDE hard drive).  Despite these problems, I had learned enough to fight my way through, anyway.<br />Just in case you are wondering how long this newbie took to install Linux, it took 16 hours of full concentration over two days.  This includes reading the entire book as I went through the project, completely reinstalling my Windows system from backups and reinstalling Linux a second time to change my hard drive partition scheme.  Now that I know my computer and how the Linux install works, I could 'reinstall' it in an hour or two.	2002-01-28

Don't expect any details, it is only an outline. It does a good job of covering terminology, and suggesting additional reading, but it isn't a primary resource itself.<br />The book is divided into 3 sections. The first is on 'information retrieval' (IR), the second on data mining, and the third describes a 'case study.'<br />According to the authors, IR is engaged in storage, retrieval, organization and display of unstructured or ambiguous file structures. Research is currently engaged in classifying, filtering, modeling, query design and user interface issues. The key question for IR is 'relevance' assessment. Each topic gets at least a few paragraphs, some a few pages.<br />The authors differentiate data mining from IR in terms of focus. A data mining project is designed specifically for finding hidden structure (whatever that means), while IR might be characterized as the 'quick and dirty query.' This is a bit confusing, but the emphasis on terminology makes it unimportant. Most of the data mining section is a review of various measures used to determine the existence of associations. This includes some simple formulas. Also, there is a section on webcrawlers and text mining.<br />Though the book is titled 'mining the www', the largest section is IR, what most would call 'search engines.' Mining itself gets only about 1/4 of the book.<br />The case study is fairly brief, but outlines a way to structure a simple project.<br />The book contains a nice bibliography.	2002-01-09

Maybe my expectations were too high.  Basically, the book reduces human cultural history to a series of accidents: accidents of geography and accidents of biological evolution.  The scope of Diamond's argument is wonderful and I applaud his efforts.  Diamond surveys 15,000 years of human history in terms of plant, animal and germ evolution.  If this is the first time you've seen the way humans are at the mercy of germ mutation, it may take your breath away.  On the other hand, Diamond leaves no role for human character to play a part.  Perhaps it is hopelessly old fashion to suggest individual responsibility exists, but I think we are asking for an ecological disaster if we abandon all efforts to cultivate it. In summary, I was turned off by the narrow-minded materialism.<br />The book is structured as an apologia from a European biologist to a politician of New Guinea. At the beginning of the book, the author introduces us to Yali, a young politician of New Guinea. The politician asks the author why the 'Europeans' have so much and peoples of New Guinea so little. Time and again, the book returns to this simple question.<br />It might have been interesting to question the premise of Yali's question.  Have Europeans really hit the jackpot?  Unfortunately, we don't inquire into the nature of jackpots.  The only measure of success is power and wealth.<br />Diamond's answer is Darwinian: it was an accident.  Europeans just 'happened to be' in the right place at the right time. Geography, weather patterns, and access to species suitable for domestication made European success inevitable.  I won't argue that random events play an important role in shaping human history, but Diamond's answer is simply uninformative. It could be summarized as Europeans got lucky because they were lucky. What does that tell us?<br />I can't imagine Yali to taking this answer seriously.  If you grew up in New Guinea with European tourists blundering through your village taking photographs and passing out trinkets, would you accept an explanation that it was all an accident?  That explanation would only work for the tourist who wants to avoid feeling connected to the people they meet along the way.  Maybe that's why the book seems to go on and on and on without coming to a conclusion.  Diamond is has no answer for Yali, but hopes to put him to sleep.<br />A far more insightful (and controversial) history of the 'human community' can be found in William McNeill's 'Rise of the West' or 'Plagues and People.' Yali would be well served by adding these to his reading list.<br />Finally, the title of this book is misleading. Germs get a fair amount of attention, but 'guns' and 'steel' go almost unmentioned. According to the index, the term 'gun' gets 8 references during the 400+ page book. The term 'steel' gets only 4 references. Germs get about 80. A title along the lines of 'Geography and Germs: how weather and disease shape human cultures' would have been more accurate.ugh your village taking photographs and passing out trinkets, would you accept an explanation that it was all an accident?

Daston wants to change the unquestioned neo-Kantian conviction that 'scientific objects' have a timeless 'reality.'<br />Daston has collected 11 essays on temporary 'scientific' objects.  Daston contributes an introduction and shortened version of her earlier paper on 'preternatural' science.  The rest are new.<br />Daston is convinced that scientific objects are created by inquiring minds rather than 'discovered' in the environment. Many would disagree, but I think the arguments are of great interest.  For example, 'ether' was an object of 'scientific research' for much of the 18th and early 19th century.  'Ether' was as real as water molecules are today.  'Ether' has now slipped out of the scientific conversation.<br />Was 'ether' ever a 'scientific object'?  Was it ever real?  If it was never 'real', could the 'object' contribute to something we now think is 'real,' something like the 'quantum' particle.  One of the essays goes into great detail on this and the simple neo-Kantian answer suffers from the examination.<br />The following is a list of the essay titles:<br />'Preternatural Philosophy':  The scientific study of singularly rare objects such as comets, two-headed babies, and sea-monstersl<br />'Mathematical Entities in Scientific Discourse': the birth and development of 'symbolic objects' such as the earth's center of gravity.<br />'Dreams and Self-consciousness': scientific study of 'dreams.'  Something that was an object of science in the 18th century and 20th centuries, but ignored in the 19th.<br />'Mutations of the Self in Old Regime and Postrevolutionary France': How  the term 'ame' became the scientific object 'le moi.'<br />'The coming into Being and Passing Away of Value Theories in Economics (1776-1976): 'Value' as scientific object.<br />'...Society as a Scientific Object.'<br />'..Why Culture is not a Disappearing 'Object.' '<br />'How the Ether Spawned the Microworld':  A failed scientific object, ether, provides the theoretical foundations for contemporary quantum 'objects.'<br />'Life Insurance, Medical Testing and the Management of Mortality': Non-scientists of the insurance business create the object 'high blood pressure' and medical science catches on later.<br />'On the Partial Existence of Existing and Nonexisting Objects': Are diseases 'scientific objects' or only a collections of symptoms?<br />'Cytoplasmic Particles':  The mutation of 'mitocondria' objects into DNA objects.<br />As Daston points out, the essays hold no single philosophical perspective.  As such, the book does a good job of covering a variety of views and hopefully contributing to discussion.<br />For me, it is a real treasure.A failed scientific object, ether, provides the theoretical foundations for contemporary quantum 'objects.'<BR>'Life Insurance, Medical Testing and the Management of Mortality': Non-scientists of the insurance business create the object 'high blood pressure' and medical science catches on later.<BR>'On the Partial Existence of Existing and Nonexisting Objects': Are diseases 'scientific objects' or only a collections of symptoms?<BR>'Cytoplasmic Particles':  The mutation of 'mitocondria' objects into DNA objects.<br />As Daston points out, the essays hold no single philosophical perspective.

The first 4 or 5 chapters will hold your attention.<br />As the book approaches more contemporary events, the authors lose their grip. The 20th century events are told as a series of individual case studies which provide only a partial view of the Asian drug industry. The book seems to conclude that the communist revolution in China solved China's drug problems.  This seems an odd way to end the book.  1998, the year of the book's publication, was a record year for Chinese narcotics seizures.  The authors seem to stick with official records and avoid analysis.  This is a satisfactory strategy for pre-20th century events, but becomes increasingly problematic as the subject matter becomes more contemporary.<br />The chapter titles suggest the book provides an overview of infrastructure roles.  Chapter titles are 'Bureaucrats,' 'Merchants,' 'Monopolies,' 'Europeans,' 'War Lords,' 'Soldiers of Fortune,' 'Spies,' 'Americans' and 'Communists.'  Perhaps a 'role' based review would be a good book, but the chapters are really sequential case histories of leading individuals.  A broad based analysis of the users and infrastructure is never really attempted.  The case studies provide the reader with a good start on understanding the 'big picture.'  It is a pity the authors avoided the issue.	2001-11-24

Mr. Gladwell?<br />'Tipping points,' Mr Gladwell seems to say, are your path to fame and fortune.<br />This sums up the strengths and weaknesses of the book. 'Tipping points' seem to be moments of uncertainty when the 'little things' make a huge difference. Knowing exactly what 'little thing' to look for is never made clear, but the right 'thing' can be worth a fortune.<br />I'm sure Gladwell is onto something here. His case studies and examples are convincing. Gladwell covers a variety of extremely profitable 'viral' projects. If you are like me, you'll be visualizing crazed masses infected with a mad passion to send you cash. Making money on idea-epidemics connects.<br />Unfortunately, the keys to our own personal tipping-point get lost in the rhetoric.<br />I suspect the 'tipping' paradigm is enough for most readers. According to Gladwell, ideas spread like viruses. Successful marketing depends on little things. We don't learn great ideas because they are 'good,' we get them because epidemics of popular-opinion spread them. The little details produce an idea-epidemic in one city, while the same idea does nothing in the next. Despite the insignificance of the details, vast differences in impact are felt. It pays to know these details.<br />The key seems to be the excellence of the 'carrier' (our infecting agent). To help us with this, Gladwell describes three required personality types. The 'connector' is the person that actually transmits the virus. A good connector knows everyone that is anyone. The 'maven' knows the details. The 'salesman' closes the deal. The best carrier is a blend of all three. They infect hundreds. Those they infect are going to infect many more.<br />Next, we need a 'sticky' idea, one that motivates action (sending you money) and is never forgotten (they keep sending you money). Unfortunately, even the stickiest of ideas fail unless the target mind is receptive, so one has to be an artist combining context with idea.<br />Don't get me wrong. This is not all about money. This is a way of making government more efficient, too! Gladwell shows us how crime in New York was halted by tipping point experts.<br />So far, so good. Unfortunately, all the examples are told via hindsight. In the present, hindsight won't help much. What do we need to know for blending connector, maven and salesman? How many carriers are needed? What makes one idea 'sticky' and another 'slick'? What helps us read the popular mindset? What kills viral ideas? Do ideas fight? Are there any ideas that are always sticky? How do we insure the epidemic keeps sending us money, don't they get out of control? There are more questions than answers.th idea.<br />Don't get me wrong. This is not all about money.

I have a few reservations, but it is an excellent effort on a subject that deserves far more public attention. For those with serious interest, there are 521 juicy pages of text and 166 pages of maps, notes and index.  There is plenty to chew on, but I suspect it's a bit more than the new-comer might be ready to try.<br />My main reservation is the thumb-nail personality portraits.  In brief, the Confederates don't do very well.  The Federalist commanders are all portrayed as above average, even the bumbling political-general McClernand seems more than adequate.  Grant is a friendly genius. The Federals have nothing on their mind but following orders.  On the other hand, the Confederate commanders are clueless, from the commander of Vicksburg up to Robert E. Lee. I say clueless in a literal way. Grant and his staff are constantly making great use of intelligence.  The Confederates are portrayed as somewhat content to be deluded, particularly Pemberton, Johnson and Lee.  In fact, the author makes an all too brief argument that Lee insured loss of the war by refusing to assist Vicksburg when asked by Davis during meetings held between May 14-16, 1863 (prior to starting off to the disaster at Gettysburg).<br />With this minor issue out of the way, I have nothing but admiration for the book.  It is not really a 'day by day' account, but comes very close.  The narrative is told from the perspective of the field commander at the moment of decision.  If a decision was made on muddy roads while a generaly dry creek is in flood, you know about it.  You even get a geological description of the mud's clay content and hence can estimate how far a loaded wagon will sink into a puddle.<br />Each chapter covers between a few hours to a few weeks.  About half of each chapter describes what the Federals knew and did, then switches to the Confederate knowledge/actions.  This presentation style is a bit difficult to follow, but allows the author a wonderful framework for engaging us in his well thought out conclusions on command decisions, moment by moment.<br />I was very impressed by the author's ability to describe the importance of intelligence.  The day by day descriptions of 'what was known' makes the course of events a great deal more sensible than other narratives.  Additionally, it helps to know the current weather/road conditions, including probable travel speeds for horse or marching infantry.<br />The detail and scope of the book are astounding.  Not only are there detailed topographic maps of key sites, but the author includes descriptions of every distant event that might bear on the campaign.  The Banks campaign against Alexandria, the famous Mississippi calvary raid by Grierson, and the well know capture of Streight's raiders by Forrest all get woven into the tapestry of events better than any other history I've read.<br />The causal web drawn by the author are based on his conviction that the loss of Vicksburg determined the outcome of the war.  This is perhaps a minority view. I happen to believe strongly with the author regarding the importance of Vicksburg and greatly enjoyed his speculations on why it turned out the way it did.r engaging us in his well thought out conclusions on command decisions, moment by moment.  <br />I was very impressed by the author's ability to describe the importance of intelligence.

The book is insistently non-narrative, it doesn't even talk about how the war ends.<br />The book recalls a 300 year history of the stories Americans have written down regarding the blood spilt by Puritans and Indians in 1675-76.  There is even a brief section about what was written down on rocks by Indians.  Instead of getting the author's 'version' of the story, we are invited to speculate on the patterns revealed by the evolving perspectives recorded for posterity.<br />To give you a sense of what Lepore writes about, the book opens at the end of the war.  We read the verbatim account of a 17th century Puritan eye witness to a ritual torture execution.  The torture, performed by victorious Indian allies of the Puritans upon a defeat Indian captive, is probably familiar, if uncomfortable.  Rather than investing the story with traditional emotional energy, Lepore asks, what is this pious Puritan doing watching and assenting to the torture? Why does the Puritan write it down?  What guilt does the Puritan wash away?  Is the Puritan enjoying himself?<br />Again, this isn't a history.  You won't find out who is right or wrong, who was brave and wise, or even a great deal about what happened.  You might get a whole new perspective on 'war', though.<br />The book is probably an excellent 'introduction' to American history.  It certainly got me interested in 17th century Massachusetts. After reading 'the Name of War', I really wanted to know more events of 1675-76 and emailed the author (easily found via a web search) for a good 'history' to read.  She suggested 'Webb's 1676, which was an equally excellent book.  Of course, 1676 made me want to read another....	2001-07-02

Believe me, these are critical notions for any discussion of evolution.  Phenotypic plasticity is the notion that different environments produce different phenotypic expressions despite identical genetic material.  The book discusses a variety of cases pulled from the animal and plant kingdom.  For example, many plant have develop into different 'forms' depending upon the altitude of their environment.  In the animal kingdom, twin spiders will build different types of webs depending upon their environment.  The 'reaction norm' represents the 'normal' phenotypic response to the environment, something we often mistake as being the genetic 'design.'<br />The book covers the somewhat daunting topics of allometry, ontogeny and epigentics, but does so in a very readable way.  The books is accessible to the interested scientific reader regardless of background.  Additionally, the book includes brief historical outlines of major lines of evolutionary thought.  These provide an alternative avenue for accessing the theory when the terminology gets difficult.<br />In short, its the best reference on evolutionary theory I've found.	2001-06-26

One the other hand, it is not as detailed as &quot;Chimpanzee Politics : Power and Sex Among Apes&quot; by Frans De Waal.  The book comprehensively covers all non-human primate cognition research as of 1996.  The authors do a masterful job of keeping their own opinions from dominating the text, allowing the hundreds individual studies to stand more-or-less on their own.<br />The book is organized along Piaget's outline of cognitive development.  It is broken into 3 major sections: (1) knowledge of the physical world, (2) knowledge of the social world and (3) a theory of cognition.  I found the first section the best researched and interesting.  The last sections is underdeveloped, but represents the state of research.  Overall, the book is expertly crafted.<br />A necessary reference for any serious about primate research.	2001-06-26

You really don't have to read any more. After that, the author gradually seems to lose his direction and punch, but it really doesn't matter.<br />The book attempts a very difficult project, investigating the cognitive aspects of story telling.  It seems simple enough on the surface, but quickly gets enmeshed in stories about stories.  It gets very confusing.<br />Turner holds that stories are based on the combination of cognitive elements called 'schemas' and a cognitive process called 'projection'.  An image schema might be a 'ball flying through the air' or 'a boy talking to his mother.' Schemas have their own intrisic value and emotional content. Via 'projection', schemas transfer their 'content' and 'emotion' onto entirely different schemas such as 'a baby horse talking to its mother.'<br />Turner's examples are excellent, particularly his parables. For a somewhat more complete study of cognitive aspects, look at Lakoff and Johnson's 'Philosophy in the Flesh'.  Lakoff and Johnson avoid the technical term 'image schema' and use the more familiar term 'metaphor.'<br />Here is a quote from the introduction that gives a good outline of the book's project: \\"Story is a basic principle of mind.  Most of our experience, our knowledge, and our thinking is organized as stories.  The mental scope of story is magnified by projection - one story helps us make sense of another.  The projection of one story onto another is parable, a basic cognitive principle that shows up everywhere, from simple actions like telling time to complex literaray creations like Proust's 'A la recherche du temps perdu.'...	2001-06-26

Many people distrust medication for this purpose, so be forewarned.<br />Regardless your perspective, this book is packed with ideas and medical case studies regarding the various behaviors we call 'ADD' (Attention Deficit Disorder).  I think Dr. Amen's books do more to promote understanding of brain dynamics than any other author writing, today.  Most readers will find the many brain-scans fascinating.  These describe the relationship between localized brain activity and behaviors.  For example, he shows how 'outward hyper-activity' is related to localized brain 'under-activity'.  The hyper-active behavior is a way for the 'body' to stimulate the brain into 'normal' levels of activity.  At first this seems confusing, but it makes sense.<br />This a great resource book for ADD. In fact, it seems written for the family doctor as much as the general public. It describes the brain physiology of ADD, breaking the general syndrome into distinct groups.  It offers a testing procedure for classifying the kind of ADD and specific advise: diet, counselling and medication for each classification.  There is a whole chapter on Dr. Amen's thoughts on specific medications.<br />Dr. Amen is not without controversy.  Many doctors feel his work is still experimental and wish he would keep his work private until his interpretations and recommendations are better studied.  He spends the first portion of the book describing his struggles with the medical establishment.  I for one and very glad he has made the book available.<br />I was put off at first by the book's title.  'ADD' is not something that can be healed.  Healing implies the existence of a wound and that analogy doesn't work.  After reading it and finding myself going back to it on several occassions for reference purposes, I've decided to ignore the title.  It's a good book.	2001-06-13

Maybe that was too specialized.  'Healing ADD' omits the integrated picture and goes straight to the classic list of childhood behavioral problems.   In 'Healing ADD', we get an elaborated standard behavioral classification scheme: classic ADD, Inattentive ADD, Overfocused ADD, Temporal Lobe ADD, Limbic ADD and 'ring of fire' ADD.    Dr. Amen provides a questionnaire for deducing which class you or someone may fall into and brain descriptions for why they happen.  It's that simple.<br />There must be millions of parents out there willing to pay a fortune to 'heal' whatever is going on inside their child's head, and this book aims at that market.  Maybe this is a case of liking the first in the series too much.  If you haven't read 'Change your Brain', nor much about ADD, this might be the perfect book for you.  Dr. Amen is a good story teller, it is a fun book to read.<br />The second half of the book includes a variety of suggestions for getting along with school age ADDer.   For example, getting mad at your ADD child every morning because they won't get out of bed is bad for both you and your child.<br />Pages 243 to 252 cover 'medications.'  For each kind of ADD, Dr. Amen lists the generally prescribed medications with a short 'personalized' commentary.  For example, he describes 'Adderall' as &quot;My personal favorite.  I start with Adderall because it lasts longer and is gentler as it wears off.  Also, the tablets are double-scored. This makes it easy to quarter them and fine-tune the dose.'&quot;  As a frazzled parent of an ADD child, these little hints may look like treasures.  On the other hand, as one who has watched a horrible, medication induced rash cover 90% of my youngest son's body for almost a week, don't forget these medications can be dangerous.  <br />Most people who read this book will probably want a SPECT image of themselves and/or child. Why not?, it looks pretty interesting.  As best I can tell, these are still hard to get.  As a proactive parent, I was never able to even find out how much they cost. I was surprised to find Dr. Amen saying near the end of the book that he wasn't doing as many scans as he had in the past.   Apparently his database includes enough examples.<br />On the last two pages, Dr. Amen recommends two websites: [...] and [...]  The second of the two seems to be Dr. Amen's and includes a lot of brain details.  It looks pretty interesting.<br />I'm a bit put off by the title.  ADD isn't a bacteria that can be eradicated, or a bone that has been broken.  It is a diagnosis of behavioral aspects of personality produced by brain structure and chemistry. There is nothing to 'heal'.  As Dr. Amen's earlier book, 'Change Your Brain, Change Your Life' says, there is plenty of room for change.  I suspect few ADDers would agree there is something to be healed.	2001-06-01

This is probably the next best thing to sitting around a campfire on a dig, and listing to the shop talk about what's going on.<br />The reconstruction of social necessities from the fossil record is excellently done.  The lesson regarding (the lack of) directed-ness in evolutionary trajectory should not be missed.  The human evolutionary tree has become the evolutionary bush, with mostly dead branches.  One might speculate on the fate of current primate relatives given the fate of Homo Neandertalensis, Homo Heidelbergensis and Homo Erectus, all existing when Homo Sapien emerged.  Additionally, the example of persistent coevolution of related anatomic or ontogenetic phenotypic expressions such as lengthening childhood, larger mature female birth canals and expanding brain size represent evolutionary puzzles with more than a touch of mystery.	2001-05-17

Maybe Freud said all there was to say about sex and philosophy.<br />Second, readers should know something of the relationship between Lakoff and Chomsky.  About 35 years ago, Chomsky and Lakoff were having a cross town battle (Harvard versus MIT) over the fate of linguistics.  Chomsky was the father of 'generative syntax' (aka universal grammar).  Lakoff was the vociferous advocate of 'generative semantics.'  Chomsky won.<br />Lakoff is now on the west coast, Chomsky on the east. Lakoff hasn't stopped fighting. In Philosophy in the Flesh, we read (pg 470)  that Chomsky's work is an amalgam of old fashioned Cartesianism and ideas lifted from people that disagree with him (Lakoff explicitly included).  In 1972, Lakoff wrote that Chomsky will &quot;fight dirty when he argues.  He uses every trick in the book.&quot;  It doesn't look like Lakoff has changed his opinion, nor his book on arguing.<br />I suspect some of the fire directed by Philosophy in the Flesh at those horrible 'disembodied' logicians (Decartes, Kant, etc), is really aimed at Chomsky.  This book might be about linguistics, not philosophy.<br />All this said, I still enjoyed the book, though it is an uneven read.  The case for sensory-motor metaphors is done well and represents an important insight.  There are a great number of philosophers convinced 'meaning' and 'mind' cannot be found 'from the skin in'(see Putnam, McDowell, Kripke, etc) so an argument for embodied logic is timely.<br />I found the first third of the book very intriguing. The early outline of an embodied logic has a lot of emotional punch.  The first third was well worth the price of admission.  The later sections seem to drift a bit, though.  Once one recognizes the idea of an 'embodied logic,' it seems we should find a detailed set of scientific evidence describing the specific microscopic foundations for it.  Unfortunately, the book stays in the linguistic domain, seeming a bit disembodied itself. Perhaps, Lakoff's vociferous character makes it hard to work his ideas into a larger system.e book stays in the linguistic domain, seeming a bit disembodied itself.

It covers a mythic battle that the reader is sure to know in outline, if not better. It peeks behind the myths, only to discover more heros. Further, it makes the story a parable about North America. There is nothing better.<br />It's interesting how the author keeps us guessing about the 'true nature'  of our heros. James Bowie starts out the most offensive of rogues, but ends up finding something more important than money. David Crockett starts off a Disney hero, but ends up being a rather befuddled witness to history (or perhaps a magnet for it).<br />Finally, one shouldn't ignore the way Williams dances through the jingoistic pot-holes. There is a great deal of jingoistic blather laid down by the Disney version of the Alamo, not to mention what some Texans think. The Texas revolution was primarily a fight for the US slave system and real estate riches. The liberties so proudly linked to the Alamo included the liberty to treat people like cattle. The Disney version hides this by playing Mexican President Santa Anna as a 19th century King George the III, but no serious reader can ignore the absurdity of such a claim.<br />Williams minces no words about the jingoistic aspect of his three biographies.  While reading, one wonders if he isn't just setting all three up for a concluding disgrace.<br />This brings me to what I think the best aspect of the book. It tells a straight story that both Hispanic and Anglo can read.  There is more to the story than land swindles, robbing the natives and slavery. The story describes how Hispanic and Anglo cultures can blend, a story of growing importance.  There is a great deal more to tell, but I like the way this section of it was told.	2001-05-06

The book does cover some counter-intuitive aspects of economic behavior, but the big puzzles like 'why do I invest at tops and sell at bottoms?' don't come up.

It seemed written for economists, not the intelligent reading public.  The book spends little time introducing accessible economic puzzles that might interest the general reader.  Instead, it spends its time refuting established economic principles using vocabulary and phrases from economic academia.<br />I wish the book had proposed some alternative economic principles to replace those the author attacks.  I don't quibble with the arguments, they just didn't have much impact.<br />For a better intro to behavioral finance, try Thaler's 'The Winner's Curse.'  For something more positive, check out 'The Economy as an Evolving Complex System.'	2001-03-27

I only wish they had added  a few more hours to the performance.  Mr. Pepys has been described as the first writer of the 'modern' inner life, fully private and separate from public duties, but I'd never been able to overcome by unfamiliarity with 17th century prose.  Branaugh's expressive but subdued intonation gets me over the hurdle.<br />I found it easy to understand... Well, as easy as any soap opera.  It would probably help to memorize a few key names.  Charles Stuart is the 'King.'  James Stuart is 'Duke of York'.  They are brothers driven from England by populist radicals who executed their father.  After 15 years of exile, the brothers are restored to kingdom.  This version of Pepys' Diary starts with monarchies restoration.  It ends when Pepys' eyesight becomes so weak, he can no longer encode his comments, about 10 years later.<br />Pepys' has many amazing eye witness comments.  At the execution of a regicide via the public torture known as 'drawing and quartering,' Pepys remarks 'Major General Harrison looked about as cheerful as  a man could be in that situation.'  When Pepys stays up all night worrying about Parliamentary charges of stealing public funds,  his fears of 'losing his head' take on a deeper meaning than slang comments like 'losing my head' imply today.	2001-01-09

Extremely well documented, broad in scope, relevant to contemporary political theory, I hope this gets wide reading.<br />On the surface, the book seeks to elevate King Phillip's War and Bacon's Revolution from historic footnotes to critical milestones.  As one reads more, it becomes clear the story goal is larger.  After one starts to make sense of the 1676 war and revolution, the picture of a coherent British-Iroquois imperial plan emerges.  Webb makes a very strong case that the 1676 agreement between British and Iroquois, something that I had only vaguely suspected after reading accounts of the French and Indian War, wins North America for the British and thus establishes the foundation for a future United States.<br />This is challenging version of US history and I suspect many will have a hard time including Iroquois to the list of 'founding fathers,' but the book is so well documented that everyone ought to have a good time chewing on the relevance of this very active and violent year.<br />Webb goes into detail on four fronts: the revolutionary conflict in Virginia, the reaction in councils of King Charles II, the dynamics of Iroquois imperialism which produced Bacon's revolution and finally the negotiated resolution of British/Iroquois imperial goals.  After completing the book, I felt like I knew why New York is called the Empire State.  The treaty signing took place in New York.<br />Webb uses an interesting set of English 'classes' to frame the action.  The 'frontier' English (poor to middle class) are converting hunting lands into farms and fighting the local tribes they displace. In Virginia, the local tribes are allied with 'coastal' English colonists, primarily the small group of 'oligarchs' ruling the colony.  The oligarchs have large fur trading incomes dependent on commerce with the tribes, so they tend to restrain the 'frontiersmen' rather than defend them.  This forces the frontiersmen, led by Bacon, to rebel against the oligarchs.  Meanwhile, the King of England is dependent on tobacco custom duties, the primary export of frontier farms.  Thus, the British Empire tends to side with the frontiersmen and naturally suspects the oligarchs of cheating on taxes.  Of course, everyone is compromised by family ties across class boundaries and the Iroquois have their own imperial agenda.<br />It gets very interesting.d them.

They are 'seizing the new day,' no gifts are discussed here.  They are a somewhat surly group, quick to anger, but careful to keep long term goals in mind.  They are still a surly group at the book's end, but they have made a lot of progress.<br />The focus is very narrow, but richly detailed.  We only follow the events in Charleston.  Who lived next to whom? What church did they go to? What school did they attend? Who did they marry?<br />This is a story of the `Civil War.' Told from the street level of Charleston between 1850 and 1870, it twists the `accepted story' presented by Hollywood.  I'm used to the Civil War starting with the shelling of Fort Sumter and ending with Lee's surrender at Appomattox.  This version of the `Civil War' starts with the Nat Turner rebellion and ends with the 15th amendment.  Instead of the great establishment leaders like Jefferson Davis and Abraham Lincoln, this war is fought by people that won't abide with bondage. It is a war between slave owners and those they seek to dominate.<br />There is no talk of a Northern Army `freeing' people, the most prominent army unit mentioned is the 21st United States Colored Troops.  The mayor of Charleston surrendered the city to them on February 18, 1865.<br />The book is organized into 7 chapters.  The first two and last are narrative, the war story.  Chapters 3 through 6 develop sub themes regarding how the winners of the war (remember, the Mayor surrendered to colored troops) went about establishing economic, educational and community institutions for `the New Day.'<br />The book is careful to bolster its case by retelling hundreds of stories pulled from contemporary sources; autobiographies, newspapers, government documents, etc.  Anyone writing a civil war film script would find this book a welcome source of authentic street scenes.<br />Despite the bold title, the notion of `seizing liberty' is rather hidden in the multitude of individual stories recounted here.  It's easy to read the book as a colorful recap of many small and disconnected efforts.  I suspect this reflects the author's desire to maintain academic respectability.  The story about Lee and Grant is, after all, the accepted version.otion of `seizing liberty' is rather hidden in the multitude of individual stories recounted here.

I am generally put off by economics books, but this one turned into a fascinating read.<br />The Winner's Curse lists a series of economic anomalies, the title being one of  them.  Thaler calls them anomalies since each defies 'classical' economic  theory, generally the notion that markets are efficient and participants  know what they are doing.  Since few would accuse me of knowing what I'm  doing when buying stocks, I find myself happily agreeing  with Thaler's  digs at Ivory tower economists.<br />The &quot;winner's curse&quot; anomaly is  the notion that people who 'bid to win' at an auction, are often sorry that  they won.  My favorite anomalies included 'loss adversion' (we remember  financial disasters, not successes), 'Intertemporal Choice' (our mental  'rate of return' analysis baffles the experts), 'the favorite factor' (yes,  bet on the favorite!), and 'calendar effects' (forget about random walks  down Wall Street).	2000-06-08

Each story begins with a patient coming for help.  After inquiring about the problem, the wise doctor does a  SPECT scan (like a CAT scan) and discovers over-active or underactive brain  regions.  Based on the diagnosis, drugs and/or therapy are prescribed.  Most stories have a happy ending.<br />As a whole, the book constructs a  fascinating link between behavior and brain 'health.'  By presenting at  least 50 SPECT images (black and white to keep costs down), Amen describes  brain health in terms of 'normal activity' levels.  Hyperactivity and  underactivity in localized areas of the brain cause behavioral problems. At  the end of the book is a section on drug abuse and brain health.  The  pictures of what drugs do to the brain ought to scare many.<br />The material  is somewhat controversial.  Dr. Amen's definition of brain health is not  universally shared.  Rather than dwell on the controversy, the book sticks  with the case study review, including conflicts with doctors favoring  'talk' therapy along the way.  In one case, he has to go all over the  country to find a surgeon willing to remove the cyst causing a patient  problems.  The story telling style keeps the politics to a minimum and lets  the reader draw their own conclusions.	2000-06-08
