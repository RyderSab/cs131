It is a very interesting, and humorous, story.  I read it for an English class, and I enjoyed it.   Imagine that?!?	1999-10-21

It had the same flavor.  It was allright, but definitely not among my favorites.<br />Ibsen is a wonderful writer, and has some other great works I would highly recommend, such as A  Doll's House or Hedda Gabler.  But Peer Gynt was one of his first, and in  my opinion, he still needed to work on his plot.<br />Disagree?  Email me.	1999-10-21

It is even very realistic and helps us to understand mental illness.  <br />Just keep in mind, reading this book doesn't make you  an expert on schizophrenia.  This isn't a professional case study.	1999-10-21

Our minds can not comprehend the tragedy of death and dehumanization that occured in the Nazi death camps.  Although Levi does  not appeal to your emotions, you will cry for him as he opens your eyes to  the cruelty.  As will you cry for those who did not survive to tell their  stories.  <br />Also, you may want to read Night by Elie Wiesel for another  account of life in a death camp.	1999-10-21

What is wrong with American society that people enjoy reading such a sick and twisted novel.  It is well-written, I'll admit.  Andrews had talent, if only she could have devoted her talent to something worthwhile, rather than cruelty, incest, murder, etc.<br />For those of you who are now so interested  you can't wait to get copy and find out WHAT incest, WHAT cruelty.... shame  on you.  <br />What would Freud have to say about this???	1999-10-12

I knew nothing about the Zoot Suit Riots until I took a class in Mexican-American Society and Culture and was introduced to this topic.  When did it get erased from our history, and why don't we hear about it?  <br />There is so much symbolism involved in the  play, which adds to its appeal.  Read it today!  Also, take some time and  learn about the Sleepy Lagoon trial and the zoot suit riots.	1999-10-12

Fernea never claims to be a trained anthropologist at the time she traveled to Iraq, she merely recounts her experiences as  they happened.  She was traveling with her anthropologist husband.  For  those who say she was a tourist who suddenly claimed to be an expert, I  think they should have read her comments more closely.  Perhaps they are  among those who skip to chapter 1 without reading the foreward???<br />Let me  stress again, Fernea was only recording her experiences as an American  woman in a remote Iraqi village.  Upon returning to the US she continued to  study the region, and went on to teach Middle Eastern studies at the  University of Texas at Austin.  I would hardly say she took a little  vacation and immediately claimed to be an expert!  Obviously, her life in  the village of El Nahra impacted her life greatly.<br />This book was great,  and very readable.  I would recommend it to anyone curious about women's  life in remote Iraqi society.	1999-08-30

It was not required reading material, but it soundedinteresting.  <br />This book was purely based on historical facts, which often leave out a great deal of detail, but the author addresses some possible implications of certain documentable facts within the trial. <br />This book is great, and everyone should read it in order to better understand the &quot;Peculiar Institution&quot; of our nation's past.	1999-08-30
US	50912089	R8B3W0M3DXUHE	0691026963	467486525	The Quotable Einstein	Books	5	24	25	N	N	I read it cover to cover in one afternoon	I think Einstein is the most fabulous man of all times, and his personality always continues to baffle me.  He is anything but predictable, and if you think he is the very dry, overly technical, personification of a  science nerd and crazy genius, you are WRONG.  <br />Get to know Al personally  with this book; I promise you won't have any regrets.  I admire Einstein  wholeheartedly, and I have been an Einstein enthusiast since 1990.  When  other teens' rooms were plastered with posters of cute furry kitty cats and  teen heartthrobs, my room was plastered with photos and posters of  Einstein.  Not because I was, by any means, the nerdy science-type or an  astrophysics enthusiast, but merely because &quot;to know Albert Einstein  is to love him.&quot;  He has a great personality, and it is my sincere  hope that the world will come to know as the goofy guy he really was.<br />It  also serves to remind me of the great men and women who were tragically  lost in the Holocaust.  Where would this world be had Albert Einstein died  in a concentration camp?  We must never forget.<br />In summary, my favorite  Einstein quote... &quot;The most incomprehensible thing about the universe  is that it is comprehensible.&quot;  Viva Einstein!!	1999-08-30

Iwasn't forced to read, but I chose to read it on my own in order tobetter understand the nation's injustices.  Douglass' first hand account of slavery is one of the best sources.  His writing isn't wordy or difficult to understand, either.<br />Great man, great book.	1999-08-30

I thoroughly enjoyed reading of Olson's adventures.<br />It is important to note that Olson was able to reach the hearts of natives in  South America by treating them with respect.  He did not look down on them  or render them &quot;primitive&quot;.  His goal was never to  &quot;civilize&quot; them; rather, he wanted to teach them about Jesus.<br />I  commend Bruce Olson on a job well done and a book well written!	1999-08-30

The story is so much deeper than many make it out to be.  Read for yourself and find out  how it can speak to your heart in ways I could never describe.<br />The  bitterness and hatred Malcolm X came to express was a result of nothing  more than the bitterness and hatred he experienced from all directions  throughout his life.  I think his story is typical of blacks in America,  and yet his response is incredible.<br />The most fascinating aspect of  Malcolm X, to me, was the change in personal views he publicly announced.  In turning from the (justifiably) angry militant movement, Malcolm X became  the enemy of white men and black men alike.  Still, he was humble enough to  admit his mistakes, and gave his life in the process.<br />Don't believe what  you have been told about Malcolm X -- pick up the book and read it for  yourself.  You will truly get to know Malcolm.  Don't let the length of the  book scare you, either -- once you begin you won't be able to put it down.  This book is excellent, and it will leave you hungering for more.	1999-08-30

It really helped me to understand the concepts.<br />I read it as a high school sophomore in Geometry.  I couldn't believe I was being forced to READ A BOOK for a MATH class!
