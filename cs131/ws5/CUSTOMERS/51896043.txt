I have been reading TB's for seven years! That's a hard habit to break! Anyway, back to this book. Ashleigh is such a fun character who finds some way to get into trouble at every turn!

Upon picking up this book, I was amazed at the bluntness of Bridget Jones' thoughts and expressions! The girl doesn't mix and match her words! I love the style it's written in,a dairy format always gives a novel a personal feel. If you're looking for a fun, straight-up read, this book satisfies without being deeply profound.

Perfect Image was good I guess but it's becoming a bit monotonous... this book and the Bad-Luck filly could have been one book! I don't like the fact that Alice Leonhardt and Mary Anderson are compleatly seperating the two stories and making Image and Star's progress independant of each other. They might aswell just seperate the series into two individual ones. It also bugs me that Christina thinks that she and Star are soooo much better than Melanie and Image. &quot;Image isn't even your horse!&quot; I wouldn't reccomend this book if you haven't read the others before it. And also, I don't think Melanie and Image's storyline is better than Christina's and Star's. I still can't wait for Star's Chance. At least it's a change of scene! Just a thought, but why are they adding in Cindy's story to the actual series instead of making it seperate? Cindy's Lost Diaries looks like a grande flop! I'll give them a miss, the first being #47, Cindy's Desert Adventure. They can't just make up stuff as they go along! I'm sorry, but that's how I feel.	2001-02-11

I don't know what it is what grabs me most though. It could be the likeable characters or the human-like horses.

Ever since Chris and Mel have come into the picture, I've found the books to be alot more informative and realistic. I mean, what 16 year old jockey gets to race in the Dubai? All the horses before Foxy, Pirate, Sterling, Trib and Star were these PERFECT beings. It was  like, well NO one could beat them! Not even Lord Ainsley against Pride.  Now, I actually feel like I could be Chris or Mel. It's not so far fetched  anymore. I liked the whole thing with Lyssa too. She was great, even though  Parker was a major snot toward her. Parker didn't come first, he placed.  He's not perfect. Oh, and for those of you who say that they still don't  know whether Parker qualified or not... HE DID! He called Foxy the newest  Olympic member when they finished the event. Anyways, if you want my  advice, read this, but don't compare it to the others. The books are not  what they used to be. They're better! And not predicable anymore. Can't  wait for Perfect Image! Brad wants Image as a broodmare! He says that  she'll never make it as a racer! Catch ya later!	2000-07-26
