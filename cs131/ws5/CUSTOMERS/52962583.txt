They did not come across strong at all.  I got 311 Pelican Court from the library not knowing there was a second book and Pelican Court was #3.  After reading the reviews on Rosewood Lane, I will not read it.  I found out in the third book what happened to Dan.  I am enjoying Pelican Court.	2003-11-17

Elena Sanoval, two below me, gave it a terrible writeup, as many others did.  But, Ms Sanoval, you mentioned the Mexicans and that they did not have a name.  Well, as we found out at the end, they could reveal their names in the beginning like everyone else, yet they chose not to.  Why couldn't they volunteer their names like the others?  Oh, because of what it would have revealed (will not go into that here, do not want to hurt the ending for those who have not read this great book yet).   The only reason I bought this book is because of Harriet Klausner.  Every book she gives a 5* rating to is excellent.  She gave this book a 5* rating also.  This book is excellent in mystery and romance.  The romance was not to the extreme, but I liked it a lot.  As I said earlier,  IT IS A GREAT BOOK!!!!!!!	2000-09-22

This book was fantastic, very suspenseful, thrilling, you name it.  It starts with Mardi getting crucified.  Abby, her best friend is devastated.  After the crucifiction, there is one twist after another.  I was so  engrossed in this book, that I even forgot to eat meals.  All the way  though the book, you pick one person as the murderer, then change to  another.  You also have all the many other mysteries within the first  mystery to think about, to try to figure out.  You find out in the second  to last chapter who the murderer is, but all the many other things do not  come to light until the very last chapter.  All of the characters were  heartwarming people except for the villians, of course.  This book was the  BEST mystery I have ever read.  Literally keeps you guessing to the very  last page. <br />I must have 200 romance/mystery books on my bookshelf, but  the first book I went to after finishing &quot;Sacred Trust&quot; was  &quot;I'll Love You Till I die&quot; by Meg O'Brien.  Is there any other  author? <br />Thank you Meg,<br />Love ya<br />PS  This book deserves 100 stars.	2000-06-21

I decided to check on the reviews thus far.  When I got to the 3rd review, the one from Phoenix, I really got angry.  My question is what TYPE of person is she.  She put  the following into the review:<br />. There's nothing attractive about Eve  Dallas and I can't imagine what her gorgeous, billionaire, great in bed  husband sees in her <br />That is the most unkind statement anyone could ever  make.  If she ever makes that statement to a real (not in a novel) person,  she would really hurt that person badly.  To say that a woman is  unattractive and she can't see what her husband sees in her is terribly  unkind. Instead of reading romance/mystery novels, she should be reading  self improvement books.	2000-05-29

I usually spend 3 to 4 hours a day on the computer.  The day I read this book, my computer was not turned on.  That should show you how good it was.  I loved the characters.  Ms. Sala put  romance, mystery and familly relationships into this book.  As for the  mystery, you knew early in the book who the culprit was, but that did not  stop the book from being a good mystery.  You have to read it to find out  why. As I said------Great, GREAT BOOK.	2000-05-15

It was the first one I read by Cathy Linz and I would not hesitate to buy another by her.  It was about Amanda, the librarian at a university.  And Scott, a detective who was brought in  because of a fire in the library storeroom, and more fires later.  They  seem to clash a lot, and they kept picking on one another.  She had a  problem with the fact that he was 2 years younger than she.  She felt she  should not love someone so young.  He was a jewell. I would take him in a  New York minute.   The characters in the book were very pleasant except for  a couple of them.  Also, the fire, it was not the person I thought started  it.  Did not find out who did it until the end.  So there is mystery,  romance and just good people in this book.  I recommend it highly.	2000-04-22

I loved the characters, the romance, the mystery and Ms. Deveraux's wit.  I noticed that this book got some unfavorable reviews.  All I can say is that the people who gave it these reviews must  be diehard historical romance readers.  Ms. Deveraux had done a wonderful  job in writing this contemporary romance/mystery novel.  I hope she  continues in this type of writing.  I have read almost every book Ms.  Deveraux has ever written.  She was great at historicals, but is even  better with contemporary mystery/romance.  Please keep them coming.	1999-12-17

She is a great writer.  There's not much romance, but there is Joe, the cop who argues back and forth with Stephanie.  Enough to let you know that there is  something between them.  I'll just bet they will hit it off big time before  this series is over.  I love Grandma Majur.  She really adds to the book.   She is one funny character.  One incident I remember is Joe had to go on  police business, but did not want Grandma to know, so he told her he was  going to the dentist.  She said that he should be like her, she just mails  her teeth in.  No matter what the price of these books, they are WORTH  IT!!!!	1999-07-28

I  saw that one got 35 5* ratings, so it's got to be another great one.  I  hate to see this series end. I hope she keeps it going.  One thing that  surprises me though is that Dallas is not pregnant yet.  It's certainly not  from trying.  Well, I have to end because I have to go read #8 of this  series.

I haven't gotten tired of reading Eve Dallas's stories.  This series is excellent.  When it is a series as long as this one, I usually switch to another author.  But with  this one, I can't wait to get my hands on the next one. I don't have #4  yet, but I will call tomorrow about getting it.  Only ONE bit of advice.   Start this from #1 and work yourself to #8.  You need to know the character  when you read the books.  And the only way to do that is to start with #1  and work your way up.  VERY GOOD READING.  I can't understand how anyone  could have given this book a 1 star or 2 star rating.  It's way TOO GOOD  for that.	1999-06-15
