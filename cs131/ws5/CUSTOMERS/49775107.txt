It does not even cover the classical seat (it even says in the book that she does not intend to cover that ground again).  But there is a lot to learn from it.<br /><br />It is written in a memoir style - moving through Sylvia's life and experiences to cover the important lessons she has learned during her life in Portugal and Britain.  Some may find this offputting by I found her writing style easy and the information highly accessible.  There are many little gems in the text if you are ready to find them.<br /><br />I did make several observations throughout the book that were slightly at odds with the text.  The major one being saddle position.  In the vast majority of photos Sylvia and the other riders have their saddles sitting far too far forward - covering the horse's scapula and on at least one occasion obviously affecting the balance of the saddle.  I found it intriguing, that she never made the connection between this and some of the events and discoveries she described which sounded remarkably like saddle sore horses .<br /><br />However, this aside I enjoyed the book thoroughly and found it did indeed give me many things to consider and improve in my own riding.  Sometimes the 'story' type books are even more effective at conveying their message than straight out - do this type ones and I certainly found myself reading this easily from cover to cover.	2005-09-04

Linda Tellington-Jones could be described either as airey-fairey mystic snake oil salewoman or unconventional horse woman. I guess it depends on your point of view.<br /><br />The book itself is rather amusing, and if you buy it with a bit of a spirit of adventure - much like buy a ouija board for a bit of a laugh then you won't be disappointed.<br /><br />The vast majority of the book looks at typing horse personalities by their physical features.  This assumes that either a horse is affected by their physical features i.e. they may be more spooky because they have little eyes and can't actually see very well OR that a horse somehow manages to affect it's features through personality i.e a suspicious horse will have a screwed up little mouth because he makes screwed up little faces all the time ...<br /><br />Of course the problem with this is ... well... we know what happens when people make these assumptions about other people.  \\"Everyone with a big nose is obsessed with money\\" or \\"all fat people are jolly\\".  It just doesn't work like that.<br /><br />If you want a bit of fun, it can while away an hour or two comparing horse's pictures and their actual personalities and deciding whether they match the book's description.<br /><br />At the end of the book there are some TTouch massage type movements - as always you can't just have a description of the movement it's got to have some fancy name like 'bearpaw' or something.<br /><br />There is also a description of ground exercises - the most useful part of the book actually - in the last 5 pages.  The dressage whip is called a 'wand' and they explain why and there is also a page explaining why they use a stallion chain on all their horses (I'm not convinced by that bit actually)...<br /><br />If you are after some serious science or even practical horsemanship, give this book a miss.  If you don't mind the odd wander in wonderland and a bit of entertainment give it a go.ook a miss.

It does discuss the scapula and withers (at the front) but there is no mention of the shelf of the ribs, the 18th rib or determining the width of the spine to ensure that the panels of your saddle are neither too large\long nor too narrow for your horse.<br /><br />- There is also no discussion of bridging or how to determine the correct 'shape' of the tree for your horse's back (from front to back not just side to side).  Should you look for a banana or a flattish tree? How will you recognise these ?<br /><br />- There is no discussion of assessing the angle of the saddle in relation to the slope of the horse's back - neither the angle from the spine as it flows toward the ribs nor the angle of the back from the base of the withers to the loins and whether this is matched correctly by the angle of the panels as they end under the cantle.<br /><br />All in all - it's a start but by no means comprehensive - for a few dollars its a a beginners guide.	2005-09-04

If you are already familiar with clicker training you will probably be too advanced for this book - Shawna's only for complete beginners.<br /><br />I've now read the book and am glad I didn't spend money on it.  Highly repetitive and few ideas.  Very basic information and some of the ideas may even put you on a different path from more recognised clicker trainers - such as the treatless click.  BTW Shawna doesn't call her system clicker training simply for the ability to TM her marketing material.<br /><br />If you are looking for a really excellent book on clicker training I would purchase the Alexandra Kurland books instead.<br /><br />Update: I've just been to see a clinic with Shawna and have to repeat that I think this author is a bit light on theory.  Shawna's background is as a trainer at Sea world so she has great presentation skills and can talk in a very entertaining way.  However, she has fewer ideas on training and a lighter knowledge of operant conditioning (which is what clicker training is) than Kurland.  If you knew nothing about clicker you would have enjoyed the clinic however I got very little out of it.  Most worryinig is her lack of understanding (or ability to explain) the other consequences of operant conditioning which are still important for horse training.	2005-06-22

As well as being easy to read and well ordered it was an interesting read with many helpful case studies and photos.<br /><br />I was particularly interested in the author's views on how and when to use clicker training.  Unlike many books the author wasn't afraid to say that clicker training isn't a magic panacaea for all ills.  Instead she explained how she uses this and other training methods as they best suit her and the horse at any particular time in the training program or for some tasks but not others.  Her analogy of having a toolbox which includes 'clicker' was an excellent one.<br /><br />If you are starting out with clicker training or are just interested in all training ideas I would highly recommend this book.	2005-06-22

On second reading there was indeed a mention of 'every illness' and the front section had excellent diagrams on physiology and anatomy - including the nervous system which is often not included in anatomy diagrams.<br /><br />The book itself is in several sections, which makes it a little repetitive.  The main portion of the book is dedicated to categorising various illnesses into 'effects' i.e. \\"Digestive system\\" or \\"Legs \ Lameness\\" etc There are tables of illnesses and injuries that can affect these areas and plenty of photos (this isn't a book for the kiddies or the weak of stomach).<br /><br />Next is a section which goes through things alphabetically and finally there is a section which I didn't think really fitted into this type of guide, which had various protocols and processes which may be useful for studs or barn owners when dealing with various illnesses.<br /><br />Because of the repetition - by area and then alpha - I didn't think that the topics received as much indepth coverage as perhaps I had wanted - the information on treatments, drug protocols etc was rather light IMHO.  Although this cross-referencing system is designed to help you to work out what is wrong with your horse, I'd much rather that it was assumed that any serious illnesses would be diagnosed by your vet and that this would then be a reference for dealing with illness and injury at home and for helping owners to talk intelligently with their vet about available treatments.<br /><br />Overall a handy book to have and certainly one that I will use for reference from time to time but I don't know that it warrants the subtitle \\"A comprehensive guide to Horse Health\\"	2005-04-26

The first book introduces him and gives some background and a lot of self-musings.<br /><br />The second book, Exploring Dressage Technique, there are some approaches practical training issues based on his own experience and understanding of the masters.

The author writes in a way that is both informative and easy to read, pulling together many resources to attempt to provide a comprehensive and objective look at the horse, its evolution and relationship with humans.<br /><br />I particularly enjoyed the sections on the horse's domestication and horse genetics. The discussion of the way in which horse breeds have been brought into existence and the various motivations for breeders to proceed with closed studbooks, while espousing the notion that they are breeding a horse suitable for a particular purpose.<br /><br />But there is much more. The story of the horse is expanded with explainations of anatomy and physiology and how these have affected the horse's evolution and interactions with man. How a horse's digestive system affects its size, ability to prosper on poor grazing and performance for instance, or why the absolute speed of horses, and indeed other quadrupeds, is determined by their physiology.<br /><br />I enjoyed this thoroughly and intend to not only read it all again but check out many of the references provided on some of the topics.	2005-04-06

Despite, or maybe because of, the simple matter-of-fact writing style this tale of an amazing, yet true, journey held my interest and I enjoyed every page.<br /><br />The book is basically a diary of Tschiffely's ride from inception to end, he writes simply of the trails taken, the hardships and joys and the people he met along the way.  This is a tale of a bygone era when great adventures were undertaken without enormous budgets or near hysterical live reportage.  Pages describe what must have been terrifying events with endearing understatement and the sort of modesty that most modern day heros cannot muster.<br /><br />Not only does this book put you into a different time and place but it encourages you to consider the possibilities within yourself.	2005-04-06

The descriptions of aids and exercises are clearly explained and often accompanied by discussions on when horse and rider are ready to begin a certain exercise or level of training and some of the problems that may be experienced. I particularly enjoy Colonel Podhajsky's empathy and feeling for the horse and that he sees this as a large part of his success.<br /><br />It is not a picture book for beginners but I enjoyed reading it as a beginner and have continued to refer back to this book as I gain more skill and training in my riding. The principles of riding are the same today as they were in 1965 (or indeed 1865) and this really is one of THE classics when it comes to true understanding of equitation.<br /><br />The book is arranged into roughly three sections<br /><br />- an overview \introductory set of chapters which includes a brief history of dressage training and riding 'schools' and techniques<br /><br />- training of the rider, which explains basics such as the seat, correct aids and the process of learning to ride right through to troubleshooting advanced movements in dressage<br /><br />- training of the horse - which looks at most aspects of bringing a young horse into training and teaching on the lunge or long reins.<br /><br />If you enjoy this book you may also enjoy 'My Horses, My teachers' - although it is more autobiographical, it too covers many interesting riding subjects, including much of Alois' own learning experiences, something you don't often get from other riders!	2005-04-06

I read this book from cover to cover and by about chapter 3 was beginning to ask myself what exactly is it that Mr Masson thinks we are? or should be? Apart from vegans like himself of course.<br /><br />Throughout the book he refers to the 'natural' life that these animals should be living, completely disregarding that the natural life he refers to does not exist.  He refers constantly to the 'shortened' lifespan of many animals on farms however this completely ignores the fact that domesticated animals in general live longer lives than their wild counterparts.  Most live less stressful lives and certainly don't come to the gruesome end that befalls wild animals (we don't begin ripping into an animals flesh and guts while it is still alive like wild predators do).<br /><br />I get the distinct impression that Mr Masson believes that all animals should live in cossetted little retirement villas as our friends and domestic pets with whom we should spend our days contemplating the universe.  He appears to have no respect or even nodding acquaintance with the lives of wild animals that must withstand heat, cold, hunger, thirst, injury without medical treatment and, of course, being hunted and eaten by their predators.<br /><br />I do believe that animals should be given respect and food animals should live good and pleasant lives, which give them the opportunity to act in natural ways until they are slaughtered.  But the premise that animals in their natural habitat live happy and pleasant lives until they quietly pass away from old age is laughable.  Life is tough, dangerous and frequently frightening for an animal in its natural habitat - if old or sick or debilitated they are dispatched by predators in a way which is not necessarily quick or painless - Mr Masson needs to grow up and visit some of his animal friends in their natural state.	2004-02-17

I'm not a PP groupie but the more I read this book the more I see how his ideas are mangled and maligned by those who are put off by the razz-a-matazz, or jealous of the celebrity or perhaps have seen a bad example of his pupils.<br />This book is an introduction.  It tries to cover all the principles of Natural Horsemanship (PP style), introduce the Parelli philosophy, give you a couple of exercises to start out with, talk about the gear and discuss PP's life and experiences.  Covering such a wide range of topics, it is easy to complain that it covers none in depth - but it was never intended to.<br />What I particularly like about the book is that, if you are willing to read it (perhaps several times), in its entireity you get a much better picture of what Pat Parelli is really all about.  Here is a man with an understanding of the horse as a complex being in its own right - not a big dog or a cow or a surrogate baby or a tractor.  He explains equine motivation, and needs and how understanding and working within those boundaries will make your relationship with your horse much more satisfying (for both of you).	2003-11-10

Many if not all of the principles are the same as other 'Natural Horsemen' however the difference with this book is the effort that KFH goes to explaining and showing with precise photos HOW to use your body to communicate with your horse.<br />I found that it took a couple of readings to get the best out of this book and have returned to it many times since then.  KFH himself states that you should not begin ANY of the exercises until you have read the book from cover to cover and then begun to read it again.  I have to agree despite my initial dismissal of this (huh? he thinks I'm simple )<br />The layout of the book is a little difficult to follow, there are examples of Klaus' work with young feral horses interspersed with clinics that he runs (providing illustrations of the communication techniques that the book is all about) exercises to perform and 'how to ride' chapters.<br />However, despite all of these foibles I found this book to be very useful.  The clarity and detail in both text and photos of specific exercises - such as leading, working on a lunge or liberty work makes up for its shortcomings.  For the first time an author details HOW to use your body in groundwork with a horse - the use of mimcry, the positions and 'zones of dominance or subservience' when working with a horse, what signals and actions will get a horse's attention and how to specifically communication such ideas as 'stop', bring your hind end under (collection), turn or come past.<br />If you wish to improve your communication skills this is an excellent guide.	2003-11-10

Although the book does indeed provide many, many drawings of anatomy and detailed views of important tendons and ligaments I found some of the work a little amateurish in that the overall shape of the horse was sometimes lost, so that it took several attempts to work out how the picture you were looking at actually fitted in to the horse's anatomy.<br /><br />In addition there is often no good way to 'drill down' upon a specific area of the body - for instance in the section on the hindquarters you cannot view one page which shows you a superficial view of the top layer of muscles - then view the next layer down - then the skeleton etc so that you get a visual picture of how the horse is put together.  Because the artist often loses detail and perspective or proportion at the same time it is often hard to tell what exactly you are looking at.  The drawings of small areas are most helpful - drawings of joints (such a a hock or pastern) on their own are generally very clear and detailed - but once they go to an overall drawing of the shoulder or entire horse the lack of proportion and detail is extremely distracting.<br /><br />For a better look at skeletons or musculature there are a number of excellent books that I would rather recommend  - including 'THe Art anatomy of Animals' by Ernest Thomson or even \\"Equine Massage : A Practical Guide -- by Jean-Pierre\\" which not only gives great anatomical guides but will teach you massage at the same time :)	2003-09-01

I'm sure that this is true and it is certainly a useful tool to use.<br />The writing style is a little repetitious  - mind you so is self-talk ;)<br />My reservations, as with all 'motivational' ideas is that it is so close to indoctrination that it makes me somewhat uncomfortable.  i.e. If I hate my job, the idea is that I think\say to myself \\"I Love my job and do it well\\" several times per day and all will be well.... so what if I hate my job?? should I not hate my job? could I not use this feeling to change my job, instead of brainwashing myself that I love my job...<br />As I say, very useful but I don't know that I can deal with the idea that this is something for all problems and\or all people - how boring would life be if we were all positive, happy little robots ...	2003-09-01

If you are looking for the 'how do I do this', its basically encapsulated on a couple of pages.<br />The rest of the book is devoted to the process that the author went through to discover and validate that there is a physiological 'relaxation response' and the ways that it affects people.	2003-08-31

Vavra writes and photographs with a naturalists eye for detail and information while allowing the photographers art and ability to display beauty to shine through in the finished plates.<br />The book follows the lives of several bands of horses on the Carmargue providing an enthralling insight into the lives of feral horses, which easily translates to our domestic companions.<br />The book is formatted so that various behaviours and traits such as aggression, play, vocalisation etc etc are put into chapters with photos and explainations showing the variations of each behaviour between adolescents, babies and adults or mares, bachelors and stallions for instance.<br />A brilliant coffee table book, an excellent guide for horsemen and women interested in equine behaviour and body language.	2003-08-31

All Other Horse Lovers Including Handicappers	Books	1	26	28	N	N	Get Robert Vavra's book instead	If you want to learn about the nuances of horse body language and behaviour Robert Vavra's \\"Such Is the Real Nature of Horses\\" will tell you much more than this book.	2003-05-27

I returned this book because I was so disappointed in it.  The diagrams are childlike drawings (close to useless) and the text is limited to the bare essentials of saddle-fitting.<br />There are better guides to saddlefitting available for free on the web!	2003-03-24

They cover everything from the most basic information like boots for your horse, distances for different gaits and even how to adjust side reins correctly, right through to patterns and techniques to keep things interesting.<br />The language used is simple, conversational and incredibly useful.  Each topic - lunging, straight work over poles, gymnastic jumping etc -  is addressed in detail with troubleshooting solutions provided for common problems.  There are sample work schedules and cavalletti patterns for most objectives.  This is a true working book that will be valuable to all levels of rider.	2003-03-24

Mark writes in a storytelling style, but his message still gets across in a very clear way.  I found I couldn't put this book down.<br />If you are into Natural Horsemanship, but feel like you aren't getting the type of communication or bond with your horse that you expected, do try reading this or one of Mark Rashid's other books.  His ideas on rewarding 'the try' and passive leadership (or chosen leaders) cut through the issues of domination found in other styles of NH and will help you find a better set of communication tools with your horse.	2002-09-15

This along with &quot;Maximum Horsepower&quot; gave me the best insight into the farriers craft.<br />It clearly explains hoof balance and angles, discusses the farriers craft, training and costs (something that should get anyone who has complained about shoeing costs thinking!).<br />I found this book an excellent guide and will use it for reference for many years to come.	2002-09-15

However, that's a personal opinion on how horses should be handled.<br />The advice on trimming and shoeing was not as clearly written or well illustrated as some of the other books - try David Krolick's book for an excellent starter.	2002-09-15

There is something about the 'master horsemen' that makes them more than great riders. Walter Zettl and Alois Podhajsky are two of my favourites.<br />They explain dressage, riding, horses and horsemanship with clarity, passion and detail so that you really can learn a lot of lessons by reading their books.<br />This book will provide you with detailed explainations of dressage movements, aids and training, as well as commenting on common faults and how to address them.  Like all the masters Herr Zettl discusses the development of a dressage horse and provides a logical framework for progression (and frequent warnings on the hazards of taking shortcuts).	2002-05-06

Certainly emails written for customers ie people external to the organisation require this but intra-departmental? To a peer? get real...<br />Just to be really irritating you could save your money and read just the first page (a top 10 list) and have covered off the entire book - which simply repeats each of the items in the list.<br />If you want a really good book on the subject then E Writing by Dianna Booher is a far better option!  She covers the same situations PLUS A LOT MORE...	2002-05-06

Its very thorough and covers the basics of each area of horse care and stable management.<br />It does tend to be very 'British' about horses (over protective) -the example care schedule for a grass-kept horse would make it impossible for most people to keep horses!<br />If you are looking for a 'starter' book for yourself or your children (perhaps to introduce them to how much work that desired pony will be!) this is about as good as it gets.	2002-05-06
