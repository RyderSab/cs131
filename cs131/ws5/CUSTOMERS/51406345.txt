Burroughs' again sets his own tone - using the thick and painful material of which his life and esp. his childhood is comprised.<br /><br />His long (long) investigation of substance abuse - and the twist that makes all of this substance abuse come across as if it might just be everyone else's fault for not giving him the right foundation and coping mechanisms wore thin after a bit.<br /><br />Burroughs is at his best when he is getting on with the business of living.  The inside journey at rehab, his relationship with a reformed crack addict and most especially, the HIV+ Pighead are indelible and incredibly revealing.<br /><br />Once again, I really appreciated his writing, his humor (dry, sarcastic, poignant), and his spirit.	2005-09-24

Side-by-side, these stories sometimes read like revised versions of the story just before it in the book.  Nothing too deep or original - just very well-rounded and nostalgic.<br /><br />\\"Vicki's Funeral\\" is a standout for me from the entire collection.<br /><br />As another reader put it - snuggle up and feel good with this book.	2005-07-23

Somewhere between Madeleine L'Engle and Judy Blume is where this book by Diane Duane fits in.<br /><br />I hadn't paid attention to the fact that this was a 4th book in a series.  I was caught by the cover and title and took it home with me.  Despite plunging into #4 without any background on the series, it wasn't hard to pick up and follow - the story in this book stood on its own and didn't require a lot of 'flashback' referencing.<br /><br />The writing is strong enough - and well-suited for the teenage crowd that Duane seems to be targeting.  The magical adventures and lore is interspersed with teen angst and qualms, \\"Not important stuff, like kissing -- how do you do it and still breathe? Is not wearing a bra a come-on?\\"<br /><br />Much more adult than the Harry Potter series, Duane goes right into battles with thick descriptions - and death in tow, not shying away from the facts of things.  She also takes the time to tuck in the myth, history and lore that flush out the story.<br /><br />A good read - I'll take the time sometime to go back to #1 and roll forward.<br /><br />However - the writing here should steer readers to progress toward similarly crafted books by Alan Garner, Madeleine L'Engle, or Ursula K. LeGuin.	2005-07-04

Suddenly, presented with a pearl of extreme potential value - they feel blessed and begin to think of all the things they can now do and accomplish with the money the pearl will bring.<br /><br />And then ... reality creeps in - and the neighbors crowd around, and the jewelers try to trick and deceive.

Burroughs, like Sedaris or Jennifer Traig, has some sharp and clearly painful experiences.<br /><br />He takes them and finds their humor - maybe he remembers the memories too bright and colorful at times - but there is no doubt that there is a lot of hurt and damage in his life.  The fact that he has moved around it and written it as he has here in this book - I think is a fantastic statement about human capacity.<br /><br />There are gobs of authors out there whose sole purpose in writing is too say \\"look at me - I'm screwed up and all these people I mention in my book did this to me and ruined any possibility of me having a normal life.\\"<br /><br />Burroughs moves carefully through his episodic mother, distant father and his surrogate family of very scattered personalities and - his own sketchy experiences.  And he does it with an awareness of the learning experiences, the formation of who he is and never spends too much time blaming any of the people in his life.  He explores them - and seems to understand them.<br /><br />I really appreciated his writing, his humor (dry, sarcastic, poignant), and his spirit.	2005-04-16

I was hesitant as I started the book - it shuffled along at a halting pace for the first chapter or so as histories and characters were laid out.  Once the strong voice of Teller was established, however, the book sailed along cleanly.<br /><br />The myth of The Pilot, the life of Teller and her adopted son, Samad - all revolving around choices and growth - moved me immensely.  Surviving great losses being a central theme to the book - the sort of losses that all involved see no way through and yet years later can look back at with a realization of a passage or a lesson learned.<br /><br />Amy Thomson handles all of this with extreme care - the tender relationship that grows fiercely personal between Teller and Samad, Teller's long-time lover, Florio, the people that both Samad and Teller interact with.<br /><br />I agree with another reviewer, however, that Thomson really dumps the emotional growth side of Samad's sexuality right into the gutter.  Samad's homosexuality is a casual jibe between he and Teller, a thing that happens after dark at shipyards and parks and fast - a thing that fades in the day.<br /><br />Some part of that might be a growth process for Samad - wild, reckless and unwilling to form long-term relationships with others outside of his 'family' and perhaps at the close of the book the mature Samad who begins to find his own voice and way in the world of Thalassa & harsels will be the Samad who also develops lasting relationships with other men - perhaps.<br /><br />But this is just a tic of the book - and should not distract from the central message and themes.  This book was cathartic for me and had me a bit emotional (happy & sad) as the book drew the its end and sailed away into the sunset.	2005-03-27

This is the book I had been looking to read for a long time... and I am glad a friend pointed it out to me.  I had read THE ALCHEMIST and then THE FIVE PEOPLE YOU MEET IN HEAVEN hoping for such a read.  FIVE PEOPLE was close - but Martel's handling of the truths we know and the lives we live through the story of PI was a perfect fit.<br /><br />A sinking ship... a tiny life boat... a boy and a large cat.  The exploration of cage and confines, isolation and companionship, preservation of freedoms and organized religion rocked gently on the ocean with Pi and Richard Parker.<br /><br />Pi is a clear storyteller - his language investigating his thoughts carefully.  His words and actions described fully - but nothing is ever overdone.  Every sense of a leaping over of oblivion, social order, and fear versus danger are explored in the long ordeal of Pi at sea with the tiger.<br /><br />At the end of the book - specifically the re-telling of the story - I was reminded not so much of God, but of the strength of human nature [or that of any living thing] - and its potential to surprise.	2005-03-16

My first Moore book and a Christmas miracle story none-the-less.  The first chapters of the book had me extremely annoyed - I had picked it up having read a review that read \\"Christopher Moore deserves acclaim on the Dave Barry/Christopher Buckley level, or even beyond that, for he's better than either of them.\\"<br /><br />Moore couldn't accomplish as neat and clean a twist and tie-out for a thought or story in 200+ pages - while Barry performs such tasks with skill in single paragraphs.  Moore is no Barry.<br /><br />Further annoyance came over the writing - which was hyper... frenetic - and the first chapter seemed especially plagued by the author dropping as many clever things as he could mash into the text - tripping over himself with obvious amusement at his own cleverness.  And similes.<br /><br />This tone calmed down as the book progressed - and made it possible for me to get to the last page.  And to actually - begrudgingly - end up liking a lot of Moore's style and especially his characters and their relationships to and with one another.<br /><br />No smoothies came out of my nose, and while some lines and ideas were smirk-worthy, there was nothing in this book of enough originality or sharp substance to get me howling uncontrollably...<br /><br />So, instead, I will say that it was a bright and cheery read - and some enjoyable characters such as Molly the Warrior Babe, Tucker Case and his sidekick Roberto the Fruit Bat - who may or may not speak English with a slightly Spanish accent.	2005-01-26

Blake Fraina joins a list of authors I would read anytime, keeping company with Charles de Lint, Patricia A. McKillip, et al.

All of the characters in KING OF CATS strongly step from the pages - each with his/her own crisp personality and more specifically, their own needs and history.<br /><br />As when I read Charles de Lint's DREAMS UNDERFOOT, I avoided reaching the end of the book, not wanting to leave the characters behind. I fell in love with Jimmy, Adam, Amy ... and hope to see their futures and pasts appear again in Fraina's writing.	2005-01-17

I waded carefully into this book, not knowing what the writing would be like.  From the opening of the book the imagery and use of language were fantastic and captivating (some credit/blame may go to the translator).<br /><br />The story itself - specifically the main voice, a young man (Mishima himself?) - never progresses.  The same lack of form and function persists in the telling of the story, start to finish.  Mishima muses and postulates about love and sexuality.  The voice explores its secrets and thoughts carefully and meticulously.  And while the explorations are clever for their language and style - they are not fresh and grow stale as they are reviewed cyclically.<br /><br />Does he love a woman, does he not.  Does he feel sexually attracted to women?  No - but certainly aroused by men.  But - nothing ever happens.  His arousal for men is only truly brought to life in vivid fantasies of pain and suffering inflicted on the men in his mind.<br /><br />And - still - at the close of the book - the character continues to avoid himself and chase after a girl he has used as his foil and who is now married to another man.  He is the same person despite his years and experiences.  This book has a potential for power - but feels sad and hollow.<br /><br />Per Mishima, \\"It was like being given a gift of damp fireworks.\\"	2005-01-09

I'm not sure whether the point is missed or taken by understanding that Jennifer Traig and her family did not have the easiest time - and there certainly is a lot of unwritten unhapiness in this book.  And it's not just unwritten, but barely even alluded to at most anytime in Traig's writing.<br /><br />Which means either she's always had a plucky sense of self even during the worst moments of OCD or she doesn't feel the need to expose her family's pain to the general public. She writes - \\"I'd say we bring out the best in one another, but it's more like we borrow the worst.\\" So, she hints at her pain and allows her experience to be a laugh at herself and - maybe an apology to her family.<br /><br />So, if you are looking for a book which pointedly exposes the ugliest moment's of a person's suffering from a disorder - well, this book won't deliver.<br /><br />Sometimes Traig seemed to make light of her OCD and how seriously it impacted her life. I enjoyed the book simply as a wry look at a person's life who also happens to have OCD.  As if it were a David Sedaris book - a humorous book that has a darker side - and not a textbook on OCD or a reality show on TV.	2005-01-04

So sharp and painful, Sapphire's writing skills leave no truth hidden in telling the life of Precious Jones, who at 16 has two children by her father, cannot read, is merely a welfare addition for her mother, and is about to learn the damage her father has done is beyond words.<br /><br />The flow reminded me of one of my favorites, THE COLOR PURPLE, but moved to the modern setting of Harlem - with so much less room for love, laughter or redemption. Yet, Precious thrives and learns and comes out of this story a fiercely loud voice and song of her own.<br /><br />The writings at the end of the book, a short, quick collection of the lives of the women that Precious meets and learns with, tied the story of nicely.

I had recently read THE ALCHEMIST - looking for a book that would take me somewhere and - personally - prove cathartic.<br /><br />While I wasn't at all impressed with that book, THE FIVE PEOPLE... proved to be such a book.  The moments after death, a life in review - and the people that have an impact and effect on a life are so often never revealed or recognized.  Not while alive, anway.  Albom's book proposes that five of these people will be there for you in heaven.<br /><br />Eddie (main character) has expectations of who may be among the five, after having met his first person - but still, cannot always know who these people will be.  The book's language runs clean and brief - without becoming bogged down on a lot of religious/spiritual speculations about the nature of heaven or life itself.<br /><br />I took a lot out of THE FIVE PEOPLE... - and, as I see from other reviews I am not alone in this, it left me wondering who would be among the folks I'd meet in heaven.  And who would I be waiting for in turn.	2004-11-13

A frontier story of settlers bumping up against the Native Indians - and both sides coming out worse for wear. Indian legends mingle with settlers fears and suspicions as death and destruction rip apart their small and struggling settlement in 1799 Ohio.<br /><br />Meanwhile, an outsider, Cole, drops in expecting to visit his brother after not seeing him for some time, only to find that his brother is dead - and the killings have just begun.<br /><br />The language was simple, if halting, remaining true to the voice of Cole - who is the story's teller. And, the careful awakening of his feelings for the Indian, Pakim, is a great handling - unusual in gay fiction where most everything is thin story pasted onto graphic porn. That isn't saying the story is deep in FIRELANDS, and it certainly isn't strong writing either. Their are a number of dully repetive themes that never really stay true to their own selves - especially Cole's conviction of his reputation as \\"Cold-Blooded Cole.\\" This reputation is undermined from the onset of the book - and seems unlikely that anyone perceives Cole in this way, save for himself.<br /><br />Still, worthy of note as a blend of historical fiction (!) and folklore and a decent love story as well.	2004-11-13

Although the book itself makes a point of showing that keeping things simple is good practice.<br /><br />The book is apparently an international best-seller that came out in '88 and has been read by people over and over again and ... changed their lives.  I read THE ALCHEMIST as recommended by a friend.  While reading, I was building up to that feeling of change at several places in the book, but it passed quickly.<br /><br />The book is simply full of short, sharp lessons on achieving your dreams, learning from everything you experience, stopping and taking the time to actually study every bit of the world around you.<br /><br />Personally - I think the CHRONICLES OF NARNIA (yes, all seven books) by C.S. Lewis achieves the same journey in a much better fashion.	2004-09-04

I can't quite catch where this book came from or where it was going - unlike other Sedaris books - this book is more like a collection of short stories and thoughts than a theme explored.<br />His mother is clearly a focus throughout the book - and the ways in which Sedaris related to his mother while she was alive.  More, he seems to explore his understanding of her now that she is dead.  Other books have allowed his father to lead as the &quot;character&quot; that was being studied.  Sedaris seems to be looking at himself and seeing the things in him that are distinctly from his mother.<br />There is, as expected, that dry, almost painful humor that had me chuckling as I read along.  It is the kind of humor that you just can't pass along to someone in a line, should someone ask, &quot;What's so funny?&quot;<br />That person really needs to follow Sedaris from the beginning of each story and ... well, maybe have an awareness that there's a little of this life in each of us.<br />One thing:  this book is much more painful and self-revealing than much of Sedaris's previous work.  The humor is sometimes overwhelmed by this tone.	2004-07-13

Well, I had a peripheral memory of seeing a DORIAN GRAY movie, but...<br />So I dive into this book first.  Stevenson's language clips along very cleanly - the narrative perspectives are always true to their narrator.  These older men - their friendships - their distress over some shadowy character that has come into and is ruining the life of a beloved friend... I never had the impression that this was what the JEKYLL/HYDE story would contain.<br />This is no &quot;monster story&quot; - it is the story of the parts of ourselves that make us whole and what happens if that balance is upset - if one side is given favor - or perhaps if the other side is constantly supressed and never let free to express itself.<br />And a side note: Doctor John Fell (1625-1686) is a symbol of &quot;an instantaneous, intense, visceral, irrational dislike for another human being. Hate at first sight, one might call it.&quot;	2004-01-28

It read like a series of short stories connected like a poem.  Burroughs language flows then stutters and then squares back on itself.  The way he experiments with the sound and repetition of words - was exciting and something I find I do in my own writing.<br />I found myself keeping track of themes - St. Louis, and green (Greenbaum, Green Inn, Green Nun, Greenfield, Green Hat), and a constant reference to 1920.  I haven't read much biography on Burroughs; that should come next.<br />Burroughs exploration of a future that becomes more primitive even as it advances, his unabashed and open erotic descriptions as a consequence of his future rather than as an expected sidetrip, and his clean and no holds barred language require that I read more of his work.	2004-01-26

Being a big fan of A CHRISTMAS CAROL, I was eager to pick this book up and see where Bayard was going to take Tiny Tim as an emerging adult.<br />I didn't expect what this story had to offer, but as Bayard was loyal to Dickens, he shows us another dark facet of England.  The collection and sale (in effect) of very young girls to the upper crust of society.  And Mr. Timothy Cratchit as its unlikely hero.<br />The language of the book remained true throughout - and the combination of characters fit all the roles I would have expected in a Dickens tale.  And while the story itself sometimes stuttered with strange asides tossed in to create time for other things to happen or to show which character was on which side - it wasn't the story itself I found myself taken by.<br />I particularly enjoyed the italicized letters that Tim wrote to his deceased father.  The language and ideas of a life overlooked, of the love one might feel for one's parent not realized until it was too late.  Of Tim as an adult trying to realize who he is going to be and not having his father to help him through this hardest of times.  And realizing how much irritation and anger and impatience he spent on his father when alive as he is haunted by his father's ghost out of the corner of his eye.  All of this as Bayard takes Tim on a journey to seek his own family, his own home.<br />Tim's letters to his father were the icing on the cake that made me truly enjoy this book and this one line in particular cemented Tim's missed feelings - \\"You had spent months, apparently, determining this configuration -- poring over maps, consulting with omnibus drivers, timing every leg of every day's journey.  Had I been older, I would have realised: here is a man who wants to come home.\\"	2004-01-11

Alan Brennert's MOLOKA'I is such a book.<br />The book's handling of the myths, legends, and magics of the Hawai'ian people had the same strong feeling for me that I get when I learn of all the raw deals the American Indians were dealt.  The near loss of an ancient &amp; unique culture and its replacement by Western values.  And the massive devastation of their population through exposure to Western disease.<br />Through reading this book I've developed new awareness of leprosy (Hansen's disease) and how widespread it is even to this day.  Even with treatments available.<br />The amazing parallels of the lives of &quot;lepers&quot; in exile, the exile of the Japanese from their homes after Pearl Harbor (in California at least).<br />This book neatly laid its arcs early and closed them just as neatly at the end.

What beautiful prose.  McKillip's rhythm and sense of self were incredible.<br />Somewhere between worlds - like the Snow Queen, or The Lion, The Witch, &amp; the Wardrobe, the Chronicles of Corum - the power of moving between worlds, gates opening to some of us, not others, being trapped on a plane that is not your home.<br />This story was like the truth of life &amp; fairytales - the cruelty and the beauty all in one.  It was the first book of McKillip's I'd read.  Looking forward to more...	2003-02-25

A beautiful story of two young men from two different sides of the tracks in a town outside Dublin.  Their friendship spins in cycles, growing slowly and steadily into something very intimate and personal.  This story is set in Ireland 1915 leading into 1916.  World War I, a pending draft imposed by the British government, a wave rising for Home Rule, the Irish Republican Army, and a Gaelic re-birth... all of this is alternately the backdrop and foreground of these two young men.<br />The writing flows like an extended poem.  Bright words are scattered about the book and re-introduced in later paragraphs.  History is always present and the future isn't much discussed.  It's a lot of what happened in the past and what must begin to happen now as a consequence of history and continued British oppressions.  It seems to be a mode of thinking that persists even today.<br />It's got a strong vein of ROMEO &amp; JULIET running through it - a strong sense of the comic and the tragic.  Still, the love Jim &amp; Doyle find for one another is the story, and it is an achingly beautiful and real experience.	2003-01-17

It didn't catch and hold my attention as other books have, but I enjoyed reading it all the same.<br /><br />The way the author weaves the lives that were lived before her - her mother's and grandmother's and even a few mentions for her great-grandmother - all on the same journeys in their own lives, looking for their roots, searching for their own voices, was incredibly well-done.  The way she leads into their different stories by way of the myths that have been told over the centuries - leaving me with the feeling that she knows how myths are born.  That a myth was a simple story that was told over and over by so many daughters on their way through their own myth that it becomes legend.  Nice touches.<br /><br />This book didn't remind me at all of MY BIG FAT GREEK WEDDING as I thought that it might.  It brought to mind other stories of self-discovery - like SHIRLEY VALENTINE, or even MEMOIRS OF A GEISHA - where the author is matching her own reality, weighing it against the history, the future, the reality of her entire people and culture.  Asking if she belongs, if she fits in, the author of PRIEST finds that she can.<br /><br />I am giving this one 4 out of 5 shhhhhhtars.	2002-12-23

The language/writing, the story, the lost time and places made this book grab and keep my attention - it took me a while to read this book, but I think that mostly has to do with other things going on in my world and also, I really found that this story was like three different stories in one - and the least important part of the book seemed to be the actual flight across the Atlantic.<br /><br />\\"The essence of elephant-hunting is discomfort in such lavish proportions that only the wealthy can afford it.\\"<br /><br />Beryl was [I agree with Ellen] a woman before her time and [as Ellen pointed out] I also think it had everything to do with her being in Africa where everyone had a possibility in that time and place and because she leapt onto the next thing and learned it skillfully, outstripping other men at their own craft.  She must have been a tough person - a tomboy in effect.  And love seems to be strangely absent from all tales in this book, although at moments I think that she felt strongly for Arab Ruta.<br /><br />\\"Human beings ... drew from Mr. Darwin's lottery of evolution the winning ticket and the stub to match it.\\"<br /><br />The very glimpse into this \\"lost Africa\\" from the colonial/empirical period is fantastic.  I immediately was reminded of THE GREEN HILLS OF AFRICA - the Hemingway book we read back in the early rounds.  The version of the book I had from the library has a frosty, austere picture of Beryl on the cover, a snapshot of the grounded plane on the back, and a recommendation by Hemingway to \\"get it and read it because it is really a bloody wonderful book.\\"  I couldn't find the illustrated version - wish I could have seen more pictures.<br /><br />The descriptions of the Siafu ants gave me the creeps.  Not a fan of the crawling, biting, stinging, poison-injecting type critters.  Maybe that's just me.  :)  On the other hand, the tail of the vain little parrot Bombafu had me laughing in spite of the poor bird's demise.  The strong dog, Buller, and his many adventures... right to the end a fighter.<br /><br />Beryl's relationship with her father was a respectable thing to read: \\"In view of this and other things, I demand forgiveness for being so obviously impressed with my own parent.\\"<br /><br />Her understanding and intelligent wording surrounding death and loss hit me at a very crucial time.  Kibii's story of the Egret and the Chameleon bringing to man their messages of the presence or absence of Death, cremation, the eventuality of Death but the need to live and laugh regardless of this knowledge - all very wisely put.dventures... right to the end a fighter.<BR> <BR>Beryl's relationship with her father was a respectable thing to read: \\"In view of this and other things, I demand forgiveness for being so obviously impressed with my own parent.\\"<BR> <BR>Her understanding and intelligent wording surrounding death and loss hit me at a very crucial time.

Just finished THE WOMAN WHO GAVE BIRTH TO RABBITS, by Emma Donoghue - a collection of historical fictional short stories.  This book was incredible - language, style, history, wabbits [there was a rabbit mentioned somewhere in each story].<br /><br />Some stories just slid quietly by - making a small statement.  But they were balanced by the ones that hit me between the eyes: Dido, How a Lady Dies, Words for Things, Ballad.<br /><br />Some particular passages...<br /><br />From \\"Ballad\\" - the tale of the young man who brought the plague to the two women he loved the most - \\"He wonders what it must be like to have a friend so long that you cannot remember a time before; to be woven together from the root.\\"<br /><br />From \\"How a Lady Dies\\" - I think this was my favorite story in the book.  The sad, aching to be that person that cares so much for someone else and has the dignity to not cross the line.  Or to be the other person, know that you're cared for so much but you are not able to give back that care - coupled with watching this person wasting away and being able to offer nothing more than a hand to hold and a smile.  *sniffle*<br /><br />\\"The voice of love is a noose.  It keeps you dangling between two worlds.\\"<br /><br />\\"The only thing one can do in Bath that one did not do the day before is die.\\"<br /><br />\\"The doctors think a young lady of fortune must have everything to live for. ... Miss Pennington thanks them all and pays their fees without a murmur.  She is coming to realise how very rich she is.  If she was only a pauper, this dying would have been over with a long time ago.\\"<br /><br />\\"It occurs to her that she died some weeks ago and never noticed.\\"<br /><br />\\"No, Elizabeth has written nothing worth marble.  Her verses are thin leaden things.  Nothing to leave behind her, then.  Only a share in a much-divided heart.\\"<br />Read this book, ya hear?	2002-08-23

He creates a tremendous and quick story to describe the life of the quirky, eccentric Duke of Portland in England in the mid-1800's.  It's great language, and many interesting ideas explored - eccentricities, anatomy, trepanning, phrenology, bits of everything seem to work their way into the Duke's journal.<br />Nicely done with some WAITING FOR GUFFMAN-like asides delivered by his staff, neighbors, etc. on how they perceive the Duke as he slowly drifts away from their reality.<br />Good read.	2002-05-27

The ideas of Transendence, the layers of space, were very nicely laid out.<br />So many cool races, so many histories, so many things that had happened and yet to come.

I think it was way to distracted with a thin thread of an idea that the author was interested in pursuing and so the story was built around that idea - of slave/master interbreeding - of the Jefferson debate (which was more recently tied closer to the man by genetic testing in 1998, this book was published in 1994) - of sickle cell anemia as a distinctive trait that can't be removed as proof of racial intermingling no matter how strong the prejudices of the person affected QUOTE: The results of the study established that an individual carrying the male Jefferson Y chromosome fathered Eston Hemings (born 1808), the sixth and last child born to Sally Hemings. There were approximately 25 adult male Jeffersons who would have carried this chromosome living in Virginia at that time, and a few of them are known to have been at Monticello. Nonetheless, the study's authors said \\"the simplest and most probable\\" conclusion was that Thomas Jefferson had fathered Eston Hemings.<br />I was a little sad that Blair was missing on a shoot somewhere.  But then, Fair seems to be having some personal revelation that may bring him back into Harry's life - so good news there.  I was also pleased that no more of the main characters were bumped off in this story.  Near misses, but no deaths.  I love Miranda Hogendobber.<br />On the whole, the book was an interesting idea - but a weak execution.  3 out of 5.  I've been near Charlottesville, but never to Monticello.  Now I have a bug to visit... thus my peeping in on the website for Monticello.	2002-03-16

I had to keep in mind that this book was copywritten in 1965.<br />The book had a strong, offensive undertone to it - the constant reference to a person was clearly written.  Everyone was simply a person but for those characters that were termed &quot;negro.&quot;  There was a banker, a realtor, a lawyer.  That was all the reader needed to know.  Then there was a negro banker, a negro realtor, a negro lawyer.  The constant reminding of which characters were and weren't was tiresome.  Some of the social commentary and the exaggerations of island dialects were also deplorable.<br />The story followed interesting developments and turns.  I spent a short time in the USVI and made friends who have homes in these islands and found much that familiar in this book.  So while it is true that island time is different than mainland, that attitudes are different and can be frustrating when you are fresh from a hurry-up-rush-rush-rush environment... it is still a strange book to read and seems to have a definite and antiquated feel to it.<br />I did take time to look up singing star Maxine Sullivan and order a &quot;greatest hits&quot; CD of her tunes circa 1937.  And I am always impressed by Edna St. Vincent Millay whose poetry is quoted within the book...<br />Worth a read, but keep your perspective firmly in the present.	2002-03-03

Okay, it is not the most complex writing, but still, enjoyable.<br />Liking Harry, Mrs. Hogendobber, and Blair very much.  Hoping the exploration of each character continues in the next book.  But what nasty surprises lurk there?  Eh?<br />This was more grizzly than the last tale - that dismembering thing, and the shotgun to the kneecap was more than a bit queasy-making.  The throwback with postcard mailings was a strange bit.  The extreme detail of the horse/fox hunt scene and even a bit of golf was interesting, yet...<br />Hot maple syrup in the snow?  Sounds like a \\"might try sometime\\" idea.<br />Going back to her religion soapboxing - she is clearly trying to divide the Holy Light and Lutheran and Catholic types.  She gives Harry a lot of philosophizing about our place in time and the universe.  Very thought provoking.<br />Other odd inclusions: p.60, referring to the Middle East as the \\"lavatory of the human race,\\" while affecting an Iraqi accent.  Odd.  p.139 referring to an animal that behaves bitchy and has been named Streisand. p.201 writing that evokes how \\"indians swooped down to kill whites.\\"  Yes, that surely happened, but it wasn't because they were whites, it was because they were encroaching on the indians land and weren't hesitating to kill the indians.<br />NEW VOCAB FOR ME<br />hectoring - intimidating, bullying<br />hoi polloi - ordinary people (Greek for \\"the many\\")<br />glad-hander - to offer somebody a friendly greeting or handshake, often insincerely or for motives of self-advancement<br />dilettante - superficial: typical of somebody who has only a superficial understanding of something<br />impecunious - poor: having little or no money, and so unable to lead a comfortable life (formal)<br />The animals cussing each other out was one thing that set me off on the early parts of this book.

I started off reading with quite an attitude - felt it was going to be way to cutesy to continue reading.  But finally the book settled in and clipped along.<br />The characters were crisp, once I got them lined up in my head.<br />I was trying to tell in many places in the book if the author was trying to use the book as a way to push some of her thoughts out on paper, in particular she writes very strong ideas about organized religion (Catholicism in particular), the culling of the weak/sick from the pack.  Having been to the Charlottesville area before it was interesting to imagine this area in the story's setting.<br />I loved the language and odd turns of phrase/choices of words the author would throw into the book.

Dade's wife, Ellen, provided a nice balance.<br />Favorite Lines:<br />p. 64 - The explanation of a \\"negative pregnant.\\" Very clever idea.<br />p. 110 - Sophie to Dade, \\"...The deer are close now. They eat up all the garden. But the coyotes, they eat the pets.\\"<br />p. 130 - The comparison of Sophie to Circe.<br />p. 144 - Dade to Ellen, \\"No computer built can beat a grand chess master.\\" This book was (C)1987.

The story is a charming story - and apparently the second book THE WHISPER OF GLOCKEN expands on the Minnipins. Muggles (which in the Harry Potter books is the name used to described ordinary, non-magical folks) was by far my favorite character.<br />The idea of a lost history, the conventionality of the Minnipin people with a dislike for individual expression is a great lesson for a young reader, all appealed to me. The story was a little scant in areas where details might have been interesting. What did the scrolls actually say? This was glossed over and then there were several places that it was assumed the reader had read the scrolls also.<br />The maxims and poems peppered throughout the story were a nice touch. Did anyone else notice a &quot;fish&quot; theme to a lot of the Minnipin expressions - they referenced many of their expressions to trout, fish, water, fins &amp; tails, turtles. I liked how they referred to themselves as &quot;the five outlaws.&quot; Wild West. Sassafras tea and watercress. Nice touches. The Family Tree.<br />Walter the Earl carries and ashplant with him everywhere. I figure that must be a staff of ashwood or some sorts. It's not in my dictionary anywhere. I enjoyed the book - but had to keep certain things in perspective.<br />I have a big liking for certain authors - L. Frank Baum's OZ series, C.S. Lewis's Narnia books. Alan Garner, Susan Cooper - magic and myth children's stories. And even now, the Harry Potter books have caught my attention.<br />THE GAMMAGE CUP was first published in 1959 - after C.S. Lewis - but before many of my favorites mentioned above. So, as I read the book, I had to stop comparing it to many of my favorites and give the author some room.<br />Altogether, 4 out of 5.	2001-09-09

I knew nothing about the making of Israel - except that it is a made country. And Herzl was all new to me - although I am still not sure I learned too much about him.<br />The circle of Moe Cohen leaving Kolkowicz and coming to the US - believing he was the only survivor and then Zach and Kalia joining the Burnside Synagogue and meeting Horowitz - who is from the same town in Poland. Was he one of the boys that left with Cohen? I re-read the early part of the book but not many names were listed.<br />The book was all over the place - and Moe bowing out of the story and becoming a side shadow was disappointing to me. He was the story... Zach's half-this half-that dilemna, and Kalia insane craving to be Jewish were distracting. Even at the end, I am still not sure what they accomplished for themselves. Are they happy because they have returned to their &quot;people&quot;? Or because they have found a way to relate to God? This book brings this question up very nicely - and it was something that I kept reading to see if they answered this (Zach &amp; Kalia) but they never quite addressed it.<br />It seemed to be mostly about the trappings for them.<br />The constant dilemna that Herzl faces between his real human side and his urge to create a homeland and people placing him on a pedestal. And the way he seems to have wanted that pedestal status. The unfortunate deception and persecution that Jewish people have been subjected to over and over throughout history. The struggle to keep Israel alive in its infancy, which is a struggle that persists as we speak. That Israel is at all is amazing - well, it has help, but still...<br />An excellent read.	2001-09-02

This was easier going than the second, or maybe I am getting into the author's rhythm. At any rate - this book takes us up and through the initial confrontation between Ramses and the Hittite empire. And then the second amazing battle which set Egypt as the dominant regional power for some time to come. An unusual stance for Egypt which typically avoided battle at all costs.<br />I am looking forward to volume 4 - especially as we appear to be climaxing toward Ramses confrontation with Moses and with the Hittites once and for all.	2001-06-25

I gave up separating the characters as near the end of the book she casually slipped in and out of each of their dialogues.  I liked the layer of lives idea and facing the loops we live in and meeting people again that we have connections with.  Anyone ever read JONATHAN LIVINGSTON SEAGULL?  That was what I was thinking - each of these characters has to keep repeating their life until they learn from their mistakes. Pretty in parts, frustrating in parts, and way too convoluted.

A mix of science - stars, mathematics, and a life story of a man who has been born a dwarf and become an author coming to terms with now having to be in the public eye where he has always hidden in his house. Very highly recommend this one.	2001-06-10

Nat Turner led an unsuccessful revolt in southern Virginia in 1831.  His confessions before hanging were recorded by his appointed attorney.  So in writing NAT TURNER, Frazier uses this document as his blueprint to fill out the life of Nat Turner.<br />I was deeply moved (and stirred) by the detail into the childhood (which I know is very freely created by the author, historical documents lacking).  But the fact that at some point Nat Turner was taught to read by one of his owners and the fact that he could read and was set upon the Bible, which Nat (who had become a preacher among his fellow slaves) used as his own blueprint and justification for why the slaves must rise up and destroy their owners at all costs.<br />The rebellion lead to the deaths of 50-some whites over the course of about three days.  The rebellion was put down, fell apart, whatever.  At its peak, Nat had enlisted approximately 75 slaves to his cause.  His surprise came in how disorganized everything became as more slaves enlisted, and how at many of the attacks, the slaves of the houses instead of joining the rebellion, actually came to attack Nat's army and defend their owners.<br />It's a powerful glimpse at an event which precedes the Civil War, and has been relegated to a quiet (and the book to a somewhat scorned) position in history, although its effects on slave owners everywhere as word spread about the uprising, must have had its own powerful undermining effect.  How well could many slave owners sleep afterward, knowing that their slaves - once considered docile and subservient - might take them and cut them open in their sleep?<br />I wonder...	2001-05-31

And it made me itch to experience what Pat Cadigan described so well - AR. The details, the rules, the help files, icons, passwords - it's a game, it's life. It's not too far from the way many things are now with the Internet.<br />That said - I had to re-read the first chapter after I had finished the book. THEN the first chapter made sense. The first chapter took a lot of liberties with what you would know, so it isn't until nearly the end that I realized who was whom in the first chapter.<br />But as it slowly slid toward finish line and the book drew closer to toward its conclusion, I found the book very difficult to put aside. A wonderful blend of technology and myth. As for the &quot;Life is so cheap in DC...&quot; - I tell you, things must REALLY be different in the future.<br />Whoa! Five out of five stars - just for being so different than many books I read and for working so thoroughly on the ins-and-outs of AR.	2001-05-04

Featuring Jeff Bridges and Meryl Streep... and no less than Taylor Swift. Gah!<br /><br />For the incapable of coping - ignoring the following warning will only save you from reading this book:<br /><br />***THIS POST CONTAINS SPOILERS***<br /><br />The nasal and flat characters of this story.  The very life, color, emotion was drained out of each of them.  I know, that was the point.  They gave up these things so that they could have \\"better\\"  lives.<br /><br />The \\"1984\\" meets \\"Logan's Run\\" atmosphere  permeated the entire turning of events.  No end in sight.  Although I  pictured mostly the cheesy outfits of the \\"Logan's Run\\" movie.  The \\"precision of speech\\" and the absolute droning manner of the  dialogue continued to wear me down.  Things like \\"comfort object\\"  \\"requisition of ...\\" \\"bicycle port\\" after being said a  few times I tuned them out completely.<br /><br />I could predict what the next  words were going to be throughout the story - so consistent was the  dialogue.  I knew what \\"release\\" was from the start.  I wasn't  surprised to learn it was death.<br /><br />The whole numbering thing, the age and  numbering thing, the numbering age and dress and social thing.  I got it -  I understood the point, but the author would beat every example into the  ground - as if I might have forgotten.  It was monotonous.<br /><br />I know, that  was the point.<br /><br />Then Jonas meets the Giver - and I think - AHA!  Here's  the answer!  And then the memories come and I think - AHA!  Here it comes!  But Jonas flees with Gabriel and they drift off into the eternal snows -  \\"or maybe it was just an echo.\\"<br /><br />So 1) Did they die?  2) Did  they find \\"elsewhere\\"?  3) Was Jonas just playing make-believe  the whole time?<br /><br />It was like one of those movies that after sitting  through the whole thing the main character wakes up from a dream.  It left  me feeling cheated.<br /><br />And then I saw it was written in 1993 - I could have  almost forgiven the book if it came from an earlier era - the '50's or  '60's I could have almost forgiven it... almost.t was written in 1993 - I could have  almost forgiven the book if it came from an earlier era - the '50's or  '60's I could have almost forgiven it... almost.	1999-07-09
US	51406345	R7L59KIYCXDQW	0375400117	823326041	Memoirs of a Geisha	Books	5	0	0	N	N	Heavily impressed and awed by this book.	I love the opening of a little pocket of the world that is so remote from my understanding of the world and seems removed and unimportant to me -- and is so much a part of someone else's world -- it is all that they know.  I have experienced this feeling many times having moved so often in my  life.  You break into a new place, learn a new place and people (every  region of the US has proven distinct to me) then you move away and it is  sad at first and then so far away its hard to remember the sadness, but  it's there and it makes  itself a part of experience.<br />The language inside  the book kept my eyes running at (happily) with its beauty and  escriptiveness.  I felt very sad during many &quot;scenes&quot; in this  story.  Had a hard time putting the book down, so I finished it faster than  my normal pace.<br />Steven Spielberg has the movie rights to &quot;Memoirs of  a Geisha&quot; and the film is slated for December of 2000.  He has pursued  in excellent detail other social pieces and I hope this is one - I'll be in  line for it if so.	1999-06-16
