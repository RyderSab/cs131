I must confess that until now I didn't realize how much thin-slicing I do in my life fortunately most of it in a positive way and the few negative misuses are not significant, whew! <br /> <br />Mr Gladwell carefully and simply elucidates the essence of thin slicing and when and how to apply it judiciousily. It really does make you question your dearly held preconceptions.  <br /> <br />I frind most touching chapters six and seven dealing with Diallo to be highly enlightening as well as saddening, as  these scenarios will undoubtledly continue to be played out in major cities. <br /> <br />Once again thanks a great and fun read. <br />	2005-05-31

I am a physics student with a personal curiosity in the relatively new and burgeoning field of econophysics (the application of physical principles to understanding economic phenomenon) so it was in this train of thought that I picked up this book. There is no doubt about the modesty, intelligence and sense of humor of the author, his ability to bring out economic concepts to the level where the layman can understand what is going on was greatly appreciated. What I also found fascinating was his take on the academic struggles that post docs and soon to be PhD graduates undertake when it comes to obtaining satisfying work, sadly it is more true today than ever!     While the book simply and humorous explores his struggles from post doc to the \\"lesser\\" world of applied physics then to finance what I found most enlightening was his methodology in doing research and attempting to build a new model or correct mistakes in an older one. Here in lies the true value of physics the approach to problem solving so often hidden and not explicitly espoused in Physics classes and he shows how this approach helped him (and anyone who diligently applies it) will get results regardless of field and endeavor. This to me is the true measure of the book and makes this an excellent book on finance and physics. Thank you Mr. Derman.	2005-05-23

Altohough I am not a fan of Fortran by any means the book (now that many of the original errors are corrected) is extremely thorough and readable, but be aware this is not necessarily for the neophyte. One MUST have a good knowledge of numerical anlaysis since derivations of relevant formulas is scant. The book's strength lies in the breadth of topics covered, here you will not find the often included \\"sport physics\\" chapter as an introduction, rather you are introduced to the most common numerical methods used by scientists when an analytical soultion is not feasible. The book does deal with many problems found int physics from scattering to quantum mechancis and molecular modelling, Monte Carlo methods and some case studies of applied physics e.g the chapter including ground water dynamics. In the last chapters the author wisely introduces symbolic computing using Mathematica as an example and this is applauded as many of us are not willing to reinvent the wheel since there many excellent programs like Maple, MathCad, FemLab etc and an introduction to the like is good. He also discusses parallel computing and this is also welcome as it has gained more prevalent use in computational sciences.    A complaint, since the book claims by its title no less, that it is an introduction to computational physics, there should have been explict chapters on or at least a chapter on Sports Physics, Astronomy, Cellular Automata. That said the case studies on molecular dynamics, nuclear waste storage and chaos are great.     All in all, a solid text but one should be aware of the fact that the author (and to some extent, rightly so) assumes that the reader has a solid grasp of numerical analsyis, calculus and physics. Having  said that if you need a really simple and thorough, ground up introduction and haven't taken the aforementioned courses then try Giordano's Computational Physics, be warned if you are like me and can barely tolerate Fortran (I grew up on C/C++) then the TrueBasic code snippets (for Mac) in Giordano's book will irritate you to no end!!	2005-03-24

It holds true not only to its reputation but to what the author's original intent was. It is thorough, enlightening, to the point and fun to read, the author's sense of humor not only aids in ease or reading but makes retention and elucidation all the more easy! This is an excellent graduate text on basic solid sate physics, even though it was published in 1975. <br /> <br />It covers all the bascis areas, from periodicty to lattice waves, phonons, semiconductors etc at an accessible level to the beginning graduate student. A must read.	2005-03-10

I tend to agree with other reviewers however, this should be treated essentially as a vocab book, since no conversations are really present. If you want to see how slang is used in conversation, perhaps StreetWise French by Ian Pickup and Rod Hares and/ or the Dictionary of Colloquial and Slang Expressions by Struth are better choices.

Personally I use a Pentax Pz-1p and have no problem with the discussions when he refers to Nikon or Canon, admittedly the Pz-1p doesn't have mirror lockup (the MZ-S, and the *ist do) but I manage just fine! The book is very thorough in  both technical and artistic considerations and I have seen a definite improvement in my photos since using it (although i shoot print and never have shot slides and that just goes to show the power of this book) I would go further to say that while all of Mr Shaw books are great if you had to pick just one this should be it. I would also advise those now getting into SLR photography that before you buy a camera buy this (or borrow it from a library) and read the section on buying a camera system, very useful!!	2003-07-15

In addition the self assignments are instructive and very useful. One minor quirk the lack of color photos, i guess this was done to keep the price of the book down given its size but a few color photos would have added emphasis espicially when discussing general color filter use!	2003-07-15

Let me say although I have given this book five stars If I could have I would have given it 4.75! I'll explain this later. The book is superb and ideal for beginner, amateur, and professional alike. It is also perfect for someone who wishes a refresher course or wants to change camera types. It is extensive thorough, simple, detailed, exhaustive and all the other adjectives that could be used to justify the authors' claim that you will never need another book. You could consider this the Bible of photography. One excellent feature is the book's modularity, due to its conciseness you can focus in on specific chapters if you want, skip chapters, and in no way feel lost. Truly a great book every essential is covered.   Having said all this why I feel the book deserves 4.75 stars not five as I have given it is simple, there are no color photographs which is essential as most of us use color film and especially important when looking at the effects of filter use.	2000-12-24
