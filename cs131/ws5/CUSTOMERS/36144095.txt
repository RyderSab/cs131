This is an account of the slave rebellion of 1733-1734, a true story told in fiction form through the eyes of Dr. Cornelius Bodger.  Denmark had claimed the island in the early part of the 18th century and dedicated it to the cultivation of crops, most notably sugar.  But in 1733, a new breed of slave was brought to work the fields: not a breed born into slavery in Africa, but abducted African royalty instead, a proud race that refused to submit to a life of bondage and toil.Thus is it was that a rebellion was fomented by these enslaved African royals and their followers with the intention that the island be converted into their form of government and run under such auspices.  For six bloody months, rebels squared off against planters, and a good deal of the island's population perished.Oddly enough, the rebellion didn't end on a bombastic note; it was quietly and in stages put down, and with the deaths of the rebel leaders, the island slowly returned to normalcy.After having read this book, should you visit St. John, you'll probably find it hard to believe that this pretty little island was once hell in paradise.	2005-03-13

This is probably the best account you'll ever get, if not the only account.  Such a tragedy that her innocent name will forever be linked to Manson and his madness.I felt this book could have done without another retelling of the Manson family's horrific development into a homicidal hippie cult and why they killed Sharon and the other victims.  We already know the story.  Rather, this could have been a more fleshed-out bio on Sharon that could have ended with her death, and if absoultely necessary, with only a brief epilogue on the Manson family and why she died at their hands.  The first third of the book is devoted exclusively to Sharon's life story.  As you read it, you feel increasingly apprehensive because you know how her story's going to end.  So many what-if's crop up in your mind that might have prevented her fate: What if she had become a psychiatrist instead of an actress?  What if she had never married Roman Polanski? What if she had moved into another house instead of the one on Cielo Drive?  What if she had stayed out a little later with her friends that fateful night in August 1969?  I asked myself these questions the entire time I read the book.	2005-01-15

It was the most dismal Olympic showing since the 1970's, and you wondered what had happened between 1996 and 2000 that caused the American women to completely fall flat.<br />This is written in an interesting slant for children, but some of the gymnasts' biographies, even if they are true, are rather invidious and would cause a lot of depression in a young athlete: most of the gymnasts started gymnastics at the age of 3, hit the ground running, and were coached by top-notch coaches who flew gleefully out of retirement upon seeing these girls perform. It must make a young gymnast who hasn't attained such lofty heights what she is doing wrong.<br />The biggest drawback about this book is the color photos. I don't know if it was poor camera angles, an overall lack of bad form on the gymnasts' part, or both, but these are the worst gymnastics photos I've ever seen.	2004-05-26

This book is so intriguing and fascinating that I can hardly keep my nose out of it.St. John is notable for more than just its natural beauty and its ruins.  This island is peopled by wonderful characters of every ilk and stripe: artists, intellectuals, writers, and the good folks who march to the beat of their own drums.  This book bears testament to the fact that this is no cookie-cutter community, and reading it will make St. John seem that much more real.Of course, after you read the book, you will have to go to St. John and meet its interesting and fascinating locals. If you do, you will scarcely pass a day in which you won't meet someone worthy of writing about.	2004-02-07

This was the first Donnie Brasco novel I've read, and I enjoyed it.In a nutshell: The Russian mob is operating an illegal casino in some backwoodsy, swampy Louisiana hick town, and Donnie goes undercover to help shut it down. Along the way he tangles with the local Italian mafia and a female FBI agent who wants to beat him to the punch.  The story moves quickly with a lot of suspense, and the ending is pretty explosive.My only complaints were: 1-The book doesn't really delve into the character of the Russian mafia hit man who's after Donnie. This character seemed pretty major at the gitgo of the story, but he pretty much fades away as the story progresses, so much so that i didn't recognize his name when it popped up again near the end.  The fact that Donnie thought he saw this hit man but wasn't sure is only more tantalizing. 2-It would have been nice to see the reactions of the Russian mafia goons Donnie worked for -- Mitki and Rat -- when they discovered that Donnie was actually an undercover agent, but they're offed before they can learn the news (sorry for the spoiler!)I recommend this book as a first-time read if you're new to the Donnie Brasco series	2004-01-18

It was early-90's Philadelphia: Nicky Scarfo and his confederates were all dead, in jail, or hiding in the Federal Witness Protection Program.  The Philly Mob was leaderless at best -- until a Sicilian immigrant named John Stanfa vowed to rebuild the Philly Mob and turn it back around to what it used to be: a venerable institution of loyalty, honor, and omerta, the sacred code of silence.To that end, he collected an assembly of Sicilians whom he hoped would literally and figuratively whip the Philly Mob back into shape.  Stanfa's nemesis was Joey Merlino, a flashy, in-your-face, young Italian American who cared more about nightclubbing, manicures, and hitting on girls than he did about the old-world ethos of organized crime.  And so the two men of different generations and cultures clashed, turning the streets of South Philadelphia into a battleground.The hilarious irony lay in the fact that Stanfa's recruits, whom he lauded as a much-needed infusion of Sicilian-born blood that would enhance the Philly mob, were the biggest band of misfits ever assembled.  To say they couldn't shoot straight was an overstatement; these fools could barely shoot at all!  The botched attempt to blow up Merlino's car was the funniest scene in the book!The Philly Mob of the early 90's was called the most dysfunctional mob family in America. This book shows why.	2003-09-27

RUSSIAN PUNK is a delight in that it shows the seedy, off-beat side of Soviet life that Soviet leaders either didn't know or didn't want to know about and certainly didn't want to reveal to the West.The central character is Eddie-baby.  As a teenager growing up in the seemingly invincible Communist sphere of 1950's Soviet Union, he has two options for his life.  The first is to become a respectable, hard-working citizen and member of the Party. The second is to become a hood.  In the rapidly maturing Eddie, the life of a hood holds far more appeal than the life of a member of the goat herd, his scathing term for the respectable working class.Trapped within the working-class district of Saltovka in Kharkov, a city in the Ukraine, Eddie-baby pursues the life of a hood with the slackers, derelicts, thieves, and murderers of the town.  To him it's all a lark: When he and friends aren't getting into mischief, they're greasing back their hair and singing Elvis Presley songs.  All these street punks are to him much more stimulating than the respectable working-class citizens of Saltovka. Though Eddie-baby is a very gifted poet and can climb higher than the riffraff with whom he associates, he nevertheless remains enmeshed in their dark world.He has an epiphany of sorts toward the end of the book after assuming a role in a violent street crime, and we all cheer for him as he as last finds the fortitude to move on and reach higher.This is a side of Soviet life you probably never knew existed, and Eddie-baby's story vibrantly displays it.	2003-07-13

ADORA is an exciting, well-written story which, when I read it years ago, made me a diehard Bertrice Small fan.The central character, Theodora Cantacuzene (did I spell that correctly?) is the daughter of the emperor of the decaying Byzantine Empire. The nearby Ottoman Empire is rapidly expanding, forcing Byzantium to live under the constant fear of conquest and absorption. To appease Osman, the Ottoman sultan, Adora (Theodora's nickname) is offered up as his third wife. She is still a child at the time of the marriage, but it is agreed that the union won't be consummated until she is older.Along the way, Adora falls for Murad, Osman's charming son. But fate deals Adora one blow after another. Without going into the convoluted details -- they'll make for interesting reading! -- Adora eventually is reunited with Murad.But he loses points with me here because, in the early stage of their reunion at least, he holds against Adora things that weren't her fault and were completely beyond her control: the arranged marriage to his father; the flight to Alexander, a passionate man and one of the few people willing to give her shelter; and other purported crimes.I loved the ending. It was very moving.	2003-04-23

According to this book, Delaware County, which consists of a mishmosh of suburbs of various socioeconomic status, was teeming with bikers in the 70's, and do you know what?  It's true! I grew up in Sharon Hill, and bikers defiantly blazed through my neighborhood quite often.  I think it was because the apartment building across the street from my house was a commune for them.  Next to rabid dogs and groundings from our parents, the bikers were the most terrifying element of my and my friends' lives.  Though we were too young to fully understand the frighteningly reality of these people, we knew enough to know that they were a scary lot.The garage/shed in which that woman was hung still exists on Chester Pike at last check.	2003-04-23

After LORD OF THE FAR ISLAND, MASK is my favorite book of hers.<br />Just when you think you have the plot figured out, she throws in an interesting twist.  She always keeps you guessing with her books, and such is the case with this one.<br />This is a story of a young girl named Suewellyn who goes to live with her parents on a remote island in the South Pacific.  It's necessary for them to flee because her parents are unmarried lovers: Suewellyn's father is actually her mother's counsin's lawful husband.

The cousin is an heiress to a sizeable estate and fortune, and when she dies in the volcano eruption that devastates the island and claimes the lives of Sue's parents, Sue makes the cunning decision to assume her cousin's identity and inheritance.<br />The book held my attention till its conclusion.

Just as VOTD was a roman a clef for life as Jackie knew it, LM is the real-life retelling of VOTD.<br />I admire Jackie Susann.  Not only was she a Philadelphian and a writer, like me, but she had such tenacity.  Even when cancer, a failed career, a mentally-ill son, and a dim future stared her in the face, she plodded on and closed her ears to the naysayers. She never once took her eyes off her dream of being a published author and bolstering VOTD to being the best-selling novel in history.  We can all learn something from her.	2003-04-03

Though this story is told as Marion saw it as a young child, it nevertheless remains a powerful and moving documentary of the most devastating war our planet has ever known.<br />This book is also a very good WWII primer.  It would be required reading for a class entitled \\"WWII 101\\".<br />Marion Blumenthal spent her early childhood in Hoya, Germany with her brother and parents.  They were a happy, prosperous Jewish family who owned a successful shoe retail business.  But Marion's safe, secure world was shattered by the rise of the Third Reich in Germany.  The Nazis, the dominant political party of the Third Reich, implemented their radical racial attacks against Jews, Gypsies, Slavics, Homosexuals, Communists, and whomever else was seen as a threat to Aryan purity.  This meant the end of life as Marion knew it.  Each passing day was a struggle to stay alive and out of the Nazis' clutches.  <br />Despite their best efforts, the Blumenthal family fell prey to the Nazis.  They eventually landed in Westerbork, a camp from which the prisoners where shipped to their deaths in places such as Auschwitz and Bergen-Belsen.  The Blumenthals were transferred to Belsen, and despite their bleak future, Marion clung tenaciously to the hope that better times would come for her and her family.  To bolster her and their spirits, she set about collecting four perfectly-shaped pebbles from the grounds of the camp.  This was her metaphor for her family which, hopefully, would remain as one till the end of the war.<br />As the war dwindled to a close and Germany suffered one defeat after another, camp prisoners were shuttled along the remains of the Germain railways as the Nazis tried to desperately conceal the evils they had commited in the abandoned camps.  Just when it seemed the war would drag on forever, Marion, her family, and their fellow prisoners were intercepted and liberated by Russian troops.<br />A beautiful story of inspiration, courage, and keeping a positive attitude evenin the most dire of circumstances.	2003-04-01

Even a perusal of it will tell you that the trend was favoring extremely young, tiny athletes, a trend which continues, with a few exceptions, to this very day.<br />I got a real kick out of seeing and reading about such greats as Tracee Talavera, Natalia Shaposhnikova, Natalia Yurchenko, and Elena Naimushina when the were just mop-haired little kids.<br />The book also contains good bios on Korbut, Comaneci, and Turischeva.	2003-03-27

This book would have been a smoother and more entertaining read if Liz had been a gymnast from the start of the story or had gotten into the sport earlier than she did.  I endured the first third of the book reading about irrelevant activities such as furniture refinishing, Human Relations term papers, the Table of Truth, and girl get-togethers before gymnastics even came into play.<br />Liz's mother's and sister's attitudes about her gymnastics were annoying.  Her sister, who claimed that gymnastics would ruin her love life, had boys on the brain.  Her mother, who claimed that gymnastics was an unfeminine sport for social recluses, needed a reality check.  But it was gratifying to see them come around at the end of the story.<br />A gymnast's life is realistically depicted, from the excitement of learning new skills to the less pleasant aspects such as twisted ankles and lacerated palms.  I recomment it to all gymnastics aficionados or competitive gymnasts.	2003-03-04

I actually loved this book because I've lived in the Philadelphia area all my life; as a matter of fact, the town in which I grew up, Sharon Hill, is directly mentioned in the book. So if you're a resident or native of Philly or its suburbs, you'll probably enjoy this.<br />I appreciated the insights I received from Maryanne and Bobby. We don't often see exactly how a person's Mafia associations directly affect the members of his family. In MOBFATHER, Tommy Del's actions are unapologetically displayed for all the world to read -- made for a very interesting read!<br />I deducted one star because the reasons for Nicky Scarfo wanting Tommy Del dead were rather vague. Was it merely because Tommy Del was a sloppy drunk and a braggart? To me, those seemed to be his biggest flaws. Aside from this, he seemed to follow all the instructions handed down by his superiors, including orders to kill.<br />The motif of this book is that if you're involved in organized crime, you will pay for its power, riches and glamor with your life --even if you're not murdered.	2003-01-13

This holds true with THOM, but...what was Ms. Small thinking?!?! I've never read a Small novel so fraught with heartache. Why oh why was Velvet snatched away from Akbar, a man she loved who loved her in return and with whom she had a child, and returned to arrogant, boorish Alex Gordon, who had about as much finesse as a bull in a china shop. I don't get it! And it's an annoying characteristic of Ms. Small's novels to let all the misfortune fall on the good guys (such as Akbar and Rory Maguire of WILD JASMINE) and let the annoying \\"heroes\\" have the woman -- as is the case with this novel.<br />As if being snatched away from Akbar wasn't disheartening enough, Velvet had to endure the presence of Alex's love child. More maddening yet, it was perfectly okay and expected of her to live with this brat while her own lawful child was lost to her. Is it me, or was there something wrong with the rationale and logic of this novel?	2003-01-02

For the longest time I yearned for a sequel to the Jasmine story and was very gratified to be able to finally read it. <br />I really loved WILD JASMINE. My only problems with it were: 1-Jasmine was a spoiled brat with no sense of responsibility and little common sense. She also couldn't stop bragging about her beauty, wealth, royal status, and important father. 2-The Roy Maguire sequence was VERY far-fetched. How could Jasmine not recall sleeping with him? How could she have been in a hallucinatory state during their entire time in bed? Give me a break! And then the poor guy's child is passed off as another's as Jasmine and her coterie blithely leave Ireland and leave brokenhearted Rory behind. This is the second most disappointing thing to happen in a Bertrice Small novel, the first most being what I discussed in my review for ALL THE SWEET TOMORROWS.<br />Sadly, Jasmine gets stupider in each successive book of the O'Malley saga.

The action resumes a couple of years after the end of SO.  Skye is at last happily married to Niall and in her proper place as the chatelaine of Burke Castle.  But with the sudden death of her father-in-law, all goes wrong, and her world is topsy turvy.  Niall, who supposedly was murdered by his insane first wife, is reported to be alive; unfortunately, he's now the sex toy of a spoiled Moroccan princess, and to get him back, Skye herself has to pose as a Moroccan's sex toy.  I don't want to divulge what happens after this, as I don't want to ruin it for anyone contemplating reading this book, but it's anticlimatic and probably THE most disappointing thing to happen in any Bertrice Small novel.<br />I thought the Nicholas character was unfairly treated and badly hurt.  Skye led him down the primrose path only to dis him at the mention that Niall was alive.  And the hurt brough upon Nicholas was especially senseless and unfair in light of how the Niall situation turned out.  A handsome, kind-hearted man who would have laid down his life for Skye got his heart broken for no good reason.<br />I liked Adam -- he was the strongest and most positive character in the book.  He was both a good friend and good lover to Skye.  I also liked his family, who were all as positive and uplifting as he was.	2002-12-19

But she holds it together; it wasn't till the end of the story, when she hits an emotional low after the deaths of her sons, that she is cajoled into becoming a religious fanatic by her cousin John Amos.<br />Corinne's letter in which she requested to return to Foxworth Hall with her children was very touching and my favorite part of the book.	2002-12-17

I was 18 yrs. old and had just gotten over a case of the flu that was so bad I thought I was literally going to die. When I was finally well enough to leave the house, I bought this book at the supermarket to celebrate my coming back to life, so to speak. It was my very first hardcore (read: steamy and sexy) romance. Unlike so many others, it had an interesting plot and characters. RS was the perfect blend of good storytelling and steamy love scenes; it's an excellent introduction to the word of romance novels.	2002-12-12

But this one was depressing and disappointing. Even so, I liked the Rhonwyn character -- full of life and energy! And I appreciated the fact that she was an excellent warrior and very athletic!<br />I never warmed to her boorish husband, Edward, and the way he summarily married his milksop cousin after Rhonwyn's abduction really bugged me out. Insult to the injury was added when Edward's brat kid was rubbed into Rhonwyn's face.<br />I thought Rhonwyn's exit from the harem was a little too convenient; never have I read of a head eunuch aiding and abetting the escape of the premier harem favorite. I didn't understand why the formula was changed in this book.<br />I gave it two stars because I'm a sucker for the harem thing.	2002-12-12

I'm a big fan of hers and have read most of her books (I'm addicted to the O'Malley saga!).  UNCONQUERED features an indomitable, intelligent heroine; exciting, fast-paced story that never lags; exotic locales; and very steamy love scenes.  The only drawback is Jared Dunham.  I know Miranda was forced into marriage to him, but come on!  There was never a more arrogant, boorish Bertrice Small leading man.  If I were Miranda, I would have gladly become part of Mirza Khan's harem and said adieu to Jared.  Jared lost even more points when he accused Miranda of having brought upon herself all the terrible things that had happened to her in Russia, when in reality those things would never have happened if he hadn't gone there in the first place and forced her to come after him.	2002-12-12

Near the end of the book, Cathy and Chris interrogated their mother, during which time they told her about a recent discovery they had made in Foxworth Hall of a small, hidden room from which emanated a foul odor.  The implication was that this room was their dead brother Cory's final resting place; what I couldn't understand was why the reader learned of this secondhand and in passing from the characters.  Why didn't the reader see Cathy and Chris actually discovering and opening the hidden room?  Where was the firsthand account?  I searched the entire book thinking I had overlooked this important event in the story but couldn't find it.  Was it mistakenly edited out?<br />The Cathy character came across as annoying, not so much for her thirst for vengeance (who could blame her?) but for her narcicissm and nymphomania.  Every time I turned another page, she was either going on about how beautiful she was or embarking on another sexual conquest.<br />Virtually everybody in this book seemed to have a gripe about something.  Okay, maybe Chris, Cathy and Carrie had a right to be whiney and complaining; who wouldn't after having your mother lock you away for three years and literally try to kill you?  But I thought POTW could have been just a bit more lighthearted; after all, they're out of the attic!  But it was the same grousing, just a different topic.<br />I think Cathy's vengeance could have materialized a bit earlier, but her method of choice (initiating an affair w/her mother's second husband) really wasn't possible until her own husband had died, which didn't happen till the second part of the book.  Oh well, I was able to rest easier knowing that Corinne had gotten hers in the end.	2002-12-12

Wow, of all the book reviews I've read on Amazon, I never saw a book get cut up like this one!<br />As a huge REBECCA fan, I bought this book the second I laid eys on it at the bookstore. <br />The ending was a total let-down; come to think of it, so was the beginning. The story opened with a funeral; after much circumlocution, I learned, to my dismay, that it was Beatrice's. It was sad to see her go when she'd been so healthy and such a hoot! Certainly one of the more uplifting characters in the REBECCA saga. Giles, her husband, fell apart after her death, which was also dismaying because he, like Beatrice, was of a more jovial nature than the others.<br />The very best scene was the one in which Mrs. de Winter crossed paths with Mrs. Van Hopper, her former employer. Why Mrs. de Winter didn't tell her off is beyond me; if I remember correctly, Mrs. de Winter got an attitude from Mrs. VH and just swallowed it, as she had so often done in the old days. That was kind of irritating.	2002-12-11

This book was a real page turner, though it didn't start out that way: As much as I liked Colonel Julyan, I thought he rambled a bit too much during his section of the book. In fact, the story was rather ho-hum until the wonderfully inquisitive Terrance Gray took up the narrative. I couldn't put the book down as I voraciously read his account of chasing down and dogging many of the exisiting links to Rebecca. Frith and Favell's accounts were particularly eye opening! Well worth a read. My only criticism was that Gray didn't make more of an effort to connect with Mrs. Danvers, but I was relieved when Ellie did so later in the book.<br />Okay, so what didn't I like? That we are told all of Rebecca's life except for the interim that was sandwiched between her father's death and her marriage to Maxim: What exactly happened during those unaccounted-for years? And I was surprised that neither Terrence nor Ellie made more of an effort to find out, considering what bloodhounds they were. Ellie managed to pinpoint this time in Rebecca's life to a beatnik commune in which she purportedly lived during those years, but that wasn't enough, especially when the inhabitants of the commune all had vague recollections of Rebecca. To my frustration, neither Terrence nor Ellie managed to translate the braille of Rebecca's marriage, to paraphrase the book, which was a reference to this iterim. I know that the journal pages describing these lost years had been destroyed, but nevertheless, I felt that Terrence and Ellie could have turned over a few more stones. I don't know how this piece of the puzzle could have been so blithely left missing, and I'm a little bothered.<br />But this book was great fun; I recommend it to all REBECCA fans.	2002-12-11

Don't make the mistake I did and read it alone in the middle of the night!  I was so terrified that I was afraid to close my eyes.<br />Vincent Bugliosi does an effective job of putting the chilling story of the Manson murders into print.  You will learn a few things about our country's criminal-law system as you read the book, so it's very educational.<br />The greatest tragedy in this true-crime story was that Sharon Tate worked hard all her life for stardom yet would find it only in death.<br />I cannot help but empathize with all the murder victims -- some of whose bodies will never be found -- but most especially with the Tate and LaBianca victims whose only crime was being in the wrong place at the wrong time.	2002-12-04

For all you fans of women's gymnastics, this is the book you have been waiting for! It leaves no stone unturned in the gymnastics happenings between 1966-1974.

The pictures are terrific! So are the bio's.<br />This book takes you back to the glory days when women's gymnastics was performed by WOMEN, not by anorexic teenaged dwarves. In fact, it inspired me to resume gymnastics after an 18-year hiautus!<br />I got in touch recently with Mr. Simons, the author, to order Volume II, but it has not yet been released.

This is one of my favorite novels, and the plot line is among the best: the epic of a forbidden love that flowers between a strong-willed young woman and a priest. The book sweeps you from post-World War I New Zealand, the barren Australian outback, the Vatican, and back to Australia. My only criticism was that it didn't have to spend so much time droning on and on about all the details of life in the outback. Most of us can't empathize with rabbit overpopulations, Aborigines dressed as cowboys, sheep, etc. But the book is excellent nonetheless.<br />TTB is an utter pathos and a study in the sacrifices we make to stay true to our faith and values.	2002-12-04

This book ranks right up there with HELTER SKELTER in my favorite true-crime books. I live in Philadelphia, just a stone's throw from Delaware, the locale of the story, and I heard plenty about the Anne Marie Fahey case at the time it happened.<br />TSW is the story of gubernatorial secretary Anne Marie Fahey and Tom Capano, a high-powered attorney with political aspirations and connections. This is a story of appearances. To all observations, Anne Marie was vivacious and fun-loving; what wasn't readily apparent was the fact that she was a troubled young woman with eating and emotional disorders that stemmed from a dysfunctional upbringing. Tom was Delaware royalty, the scion of a wealthy Italian-American family who had the brains to take the Capanos to new levels both politically and socially. To all who knew him, he was the biggest mover and shaker in the state. What wasn't readily apparent was the fact that he was a manipulative, obsessive lothario who preyed upon helpless, insecure women.<br />You will be glued to this book as you read how Capano literally tried to get away with murder and the anguish the Fahey family experienced as all attempts to locate their sister were in vain. The culmination came with the incriminating discovery of the cooler and the decree of the death penalty, which Capano appeals to this very day.	2002-12-04

I read this book voraciously from start to finish when I was in 7th grade and have never forgotten it. It illustrates how important it is to have faith in a dream and to go after what you want even when everyone tells you it's impossible. And if you've ever dearly loved a pet, this is the story for you.<br />Momo, a young Tibetian girl, yearns to own a Lhasa Apso, but an expensive pedigree dog like that is beyond her family's meager budget. Undaunted, Momo hopes and prays for one to come her way, certain that it will. Her faith and tenacity pay off when a traveling merchant presents her with an adorable Lhasa puppy, whom Momo promptly names Pempa. All is perfect in Momo's world until the day Pempa is stolen by thieves on their way to India. You will learn a lot about that part of the world as Momo tirelessly treks through Tibet, Nepal, Bhutan, and finally India to retrieve her beloved pooch.<br />She stumbles into a lot of interesting characters along the way, making this story an even more enjoyable read.	2002-12-04

This is one of my favorite books from Bertrice Small -- I've read practically everything she's written. She got a lot of things right with TLS: the strong bond shared by twins, dysfunctional family life, exotic locales, eroticism, soul mates, and the enduring power of a love that cannot be dissolved.<br />But the absolutely frustrating thing is that we never learn whether or not Sorcha MacDuff's well-thought-out plans of vengeance ever come to full fruition. Regan/Zaynab is whisked out of Scotland, and we never again see this land or any of the Scottish characters. What I don't understand is why Regan/Zaynab didn't return to her homeland years later to visit her sister and find out whether or not their mother's hoped-for revenge ever materialized.<br />The most heartwarming aspect of the book is the reunion of Regan/Zaynab and Karim against the most impossible of odds.	2002-12-04

I read this book when I was 11 years old and immediately declared it the best book ever. In the 20-odd years since I made that statement, I have read many other books that earned the same honor. But HTS stays in my mind because it wasn't a sappy kids' book; this was a story about a very real girl whom I could relate to.<br />Harriet wasn't the average simpering little girl content to stay at home all day with her Barbie dolls; she was an off-the-beaten path sort who found joy in the unconventional; hence her penchant to spy on people. I laughed aloud as she unabashedly peered through windows and took sharp notes on what she observed. Thanks to her, I took up spying for a brief time after I read this book.

Anyone who reads this book will know, and hopefully understand, her much better.  However crass she is wont to be, the woman is a tenacious survivor who doesn't let anyone put her down.<br />The book lost me toward the end.

This book made me feel that I had lived inside Kurt's head; it was that detailed and intimate.  Things were revealed that I never read or heard anywhere, even in COME AS YOU ARE.  I did notice that this book doesn't vituperate Courtney Love as much as other publications do and seems to cast her in a positive light.<br />Though it rambled at times, making it difficult for me to wade through, you will read in minute detail virtually every aspect of Kurt's life, from his growing up in Aberdeen to the difficult years of his life that followed his parents' divorce to the rudimentary beginnings of Nirvana, the band that would forever change music and the way we thought about it.  It also summarizes his final days and the thoughts in his troubled mind that led to his alleged suicide.<br />If you've read COME AS YOU ARE, HEAVIER THAN HEAVEN makes an excellent companion piece.  CAYA is significant in that it was written before Cobain's death and bears no eerie presentiment of doom, as this book does (the preface is about the gun shop in which Kurt purchased his suicide weapon).  However, this foreshadowing does not, in my opinion, mar the flow of the story.  <br />All in all, I would say this book deserves a place on every Nirvana fan's bookshelf.	2002-11-27

Not only is the story captivating and engrossing, it's very well written! The prose is neither cumbersome nor abstruse, and I love the metaphors Sayuri uses to describe things and people (I can't think of any offhand!).<br />It is the story of a poor Japanese peasant girl named Chiyo who is whisked away to a geisha house by a well-meaning but thoughtless village bigwig. She is accepted into a Kyoto okiya, or geisha house, and put to work as a servant girl while she attends geisha school. The condition is that if she can prove she has what it takes to be a geisha, she will not have to work as a servant any longer; if, however, she fails in her geisha studies, she will remain a servant for the rest of her life.<br />Chiyo gives the geisha thing a go but is not really successful at it: Not only does she pine for her family and her old life, but she also is tormented at every turn by Hatsumomo, the principal geisha in the okiya who, but virtue of her status, holds the power of life and death over Chiyo. A thwarted escape attempt from the okiya effectively squashes Chiyo's geisha aspirations. She is removed from geisha school and forced to live out her life as a servant.<br />Until one day when a chance meeting with the Chairman defines Chiyo's destiny. She makes the only choice available to her to improve her quality of life: She puts her heart and mind into becoming a geisha. Fate plays wonderfully into her hands when Mameha, Hatsumomo's hated rival, takes Chiyo under her wing and molds her into one of Japan's most famed geisha.<br />Renamed Sayuri, Chiyo is the talk of Kyoto. Even Hatsumomo, her tormentor, is slowly and gradually vanquished by Sayuri's increasing power and fame. The only part of Sayuri's life that saddens her is her unrequited yearning for the Chairman, a man she loves whom she believes she can never have and who, as far as we can tell, regards her as just an acquaintance.<br />The story picks upmomentum as it races ahead to World War II. While it doesn't disappoint in its description of how Sayuri and her geisha peers survived during this dark time in history, the action and excitement level off after this. Though it continues to be a fine story, things work out a little too conveniently in the end. But, all in all, a very fine and entertaining effort.<br />Like SHE'S COME UNDONE, the reader will marvel that this story was written by a man peering through a woman's eyes.	2002-11-25

I like Margaret Atwood -- after reading LADY ORACLE, I wanted to read this book, especially after having seen parts of the movie years ago.  <br />While Ms. Atwood is a fine writer, she really lost me toward the end of the book.  Her prose had become so arcane and abstruse that I simply couldn't make it throught the last few chapters.  Also, the action unfolds WAY too slowly: Just when the main character (I can't remember her name now) is about to happen upon an important clue concerning her father's disappearance, the action veers off to another direction.  It's as if Ms. Atwood had a bad case of ADD while writing this book.<br />I think the main character's father's body was found at the bottom of that bay or whatever body of water was close at hand --I THINK.  I was so lost and confused at that point that I had lost all track of what was happening.  This would have been a much more effective novel if it were faster-paced and not hampered by such cumbersome prose.	2002-11-25

Nirvana was the band that, to use a cliche, changed the world.  And not only the music world, but the world in general.  All the music that exists up to the present day is classified as pre-Nirvana or post-Nirvana.  And there is one inescapable fact: Nirvana either made or broke all the bands of their time.<br />As far as Nirvana changing the world, they gave voice to Generation X.  They forced the world to see, through Cobain's anguished wails, that Gen Xers weren't the reviled group the baby boomers and older generations had made them out to be.  Gen Xers were, and still are, vicitms of circumstance.  They were born in the wrong time and entered adulthood and the workplace just in time to watch the recession, AIDS, and a host of other wrongs sweep away from them the lives and the careers for which they had so ardently prepared themselves.<br />This book is keen and unapologetic; even the final chapter, added after Cobain's death, is not an exercise in sympathy.  It merely caps the life of a world-changing musical group and its unforgettable leader.  We can all learn something from Kurt Cobain: he was a man of integrity who created what he thought good music should sound like, caring little for the notions of conventional wisdom.  He remained true to himself, and because of that the world will remember him forever.  <br />Readers will delight in the variety of pictures and graphics scattered throughout the book and at the clever chapter titles.  This is a book about the band and the person who gave voice to Gen X.	2002-11-25
US	36144095	R5YYBH3JLTMND	0380778556	39495389	Rebecca	Books	5	8	10	N	N	My favorite novel of all time.	I had to read this book as required reading in high school.  I didn't think it would interest me, but happily, it did!!  Everything about it was fascinating, from the characters to Manderley to Ms. DuMaurier's graceful (if somewhat rambling)prose.  Naturally, I read the sequel MRS. de WINTER immediately after it was published. I am in the process of reading the third book in the series, REBECCA'S TALE.<br />REBECCA is narrated my the nameless Mrs. de Winter.  A traveling companion and servant to a snobbish socialite, Mrs. de Winter is swept off her feet by Maxim de Winter, a wealthy and sophisticated widower, while on vacation in Monte Carlo with her employer.  After a whirlwind courtship and quick, quiet wedding, Maxim whisks her away to Manderley, his ancestral home on the Cornish coast in England.  She's not there long before she realizes that her predecessor, the ineffably beautiful and accomplished Rebecca, is everywhere yet nowhere, dead yet still alive, gone yet not forgotten.  And no one underscores these sentiments more strongly than Mrs. Danvers, Manderley's housekeeper who had been Rebecca's loyal serving woman.  Constantly haunted by Rebecca's memory and forced to do battle with Maxim's odd mood swings, Mrs. de Winter fights to hold her own in her new milieu.  The turning point in the story comes with the discovery of Rebecca's sunken sailboat at the bottom of the bay, and with it horrifying new revelations that she may not have drowned but had been murdered instead.  A series of suspenseful events follows that will keep you on the edge of your seat as the de Winters fight for their love and their lives, and the story concludes with a shocking ending.<br />The movie, made in 1940 by Alfred Hitchcock, is also excellent and stays pretty true to the novel.	2002-11-19

I finished this book in one night -- it was so engrossing that I couldn't put it down! As dysfunctional as Dolores is, we can all find a bit of ourselves in her. She's a real person with real problems we can relate to. How she turns her life around in the end to one of relative normalcy is amazing. You feel that if she can conquer her demons, then anyone can conquer his or hers! The part about Dante was insane; I won't go into detail about it because I don't want to ruin it for anyone who wants to read this terrific book.	2002-11-19

He even gives concise, clear directions on how to get to each one.  Thanks to him, we found our way to the America Hill trail with ease, and I must say the view from that vantage point was certainly worth the arduous hike up that mountain!  He even gives advice on the best snorkeling spots as well as snippets of St. John history.  After perusing this book, you feel as if you've been to St. John even if you never have!  An absolute must for properly and thoroughly exploring the island.  The only drawback is the lack of color photographs of the vegetation he describes.  Also, the maps are very helpful.	2002-11-13

Before I criticize this book, let me first say I gleaned lots of useful ideas for my own relocation to the island.  As much as I enjoyed reading it, I was put off by the fact that this couple -- and in particular the wife, who narrates the story -- had yuppie written all over them.  They struck me as people who couldn't bear to live a day without their cappuccino machine and laptop computers, raising serious doubts in my mind as to their ability to successfully adapt to the vicissitudes of island life.  Also, they seemed to have money to burn, as evidenced by their too-frequent jaunts to St. Croix and other destinations, making me feel that on occasion they were losing their focus on their goal of relocating to St. John<br />I think this would have been a much more effective story if it had been written by average working-class people whose Continental lives were played out and who held the burning desire to move to a beautiful island to start all over again, and who perhaps had to take on second jobs to generate additional income to make this happen.  I didn't feel entirely sorry for Karin and Bob because they were two well-to-do people living a seemingly perfect life in a beautiful New England home with all the amenities they could ask for.  They didn't seem particularly unhappy with any aspects of their lives, in sharp contrast to several people I know who have made the move to St. John.  The only reason they wanted out was because they wanted a taste of Paradise.  Not that there's anything wrong with that; it's a perfectly valid reason.  But I would have empathized with them much more had they been down on their luck.<br />In retrospect, I must say that Karin and Bob weren't good candidates for relocating to St. John.  At times I felt they would have benefited more by vacationing there several times a year instead -- they had salaries and work schedules that would have allowed them this privilege.  I felt it impossible to feel sorry for them and at times didn'tcare whether they made it to the island or not.<br />Having said all that, this book scores huge points in the true-to-life parts describing St. John.  It really did make me feel as if I was there with them.  I've been to the island several times in the past few years, so I was able to validate these experiences.	2002-11-07
