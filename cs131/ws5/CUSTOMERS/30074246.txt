Unfortunately, it doesn't do that enough. It actually gives short shrift to the purported subject of the book, which is how to proclaim the gospel in large public meetings.	2005-09-27

A persuasive case for moral action	Rod Parsley is most definitely NOT your typical conservative Christian preacher. In this book, he cuts through the clutter of conflicting extremes and makes a very persuasive case for people concerned with the moral decay of America to get out of the pews and take action. In chapters covering topics as diverse as judicial tyranny, race, poverty, Islam and life issues, Parsley shows both boldness and compassion. This book could well be the catalyst that starts a moral revolution in America.	2005-04-16

He's arranged the New King James Version into 365 daily readings. Each day features a selection from the Old Testament, Psalms, Proverbs and the New Testament. There's also an expository note based on that day's reading - that's the most distinctive feature of this resource. MacArthur is the gold standard for expositors as far as I'm concerned, so it's good news. I've used other reading programs that I like better, but this works just fine.	2005-01-04

He doesn't write terribly well, but he is thorough and insighful. This is one of his better books. It's a study of the crucifixion  - written well before the movie The Passion of the Christ and so obviously not written to capitalize on the film, as other books on this topic seem to be. He focuses on how God displayed His sovereignty through the events of the crucifixion. Very, very well done.	2004-11-13

But this book is one of the weakest of his I've read. Two problems: it doesn't do much to live up to its subtitle - How to Understand, Study and Apply God's Word. There's very little of that here, just one chapter on study methods and none on application. Second, it may just seem like he plugs his study bible in every chapter. But he doesn't miss many. It's jarring to see someone you respect so much as a teacher selling another book in one of his books.<br /><br />What is here is a solid and profound defense of the Bible as the Word of God. It would have been worth five stars if it had been titled properly and not fashioned into a sales tool for his study Bible.	2004-10-13

That alone makes it better than most books written for the Christian market. But it's another version of the same marital advice you can find in a host of other books. It's not a bad place to start for new Christians or newlyweds.

The Rosbergs may have let their egos get the best of them when they allowed themselves to be labeled &quot;America's Family Coaches,&quot; but that ego isn't otherwise much in display on these pages.

Warren has many critics who claim his methods aren't biblical. It's clear they haven't read this book. This is the most biblical book about how to &quot;do church&quot; that I have read.

And it would be effective for anyone who is called to minister to people who have suffered or are suffering great loss. Sittser weaves his own experience and those of others into his discussion effectively. There is not the Biblical basis for his views I would have liked to have seen - odd for a professor of religion. But, it's well worth the time of anyone struggling with loss or ministering to those in that situation. And face it, sooner or later that's all of us.	2004-06-24

I think it could be especially valuable for new Christians. Like The Prayer of Jabez, it's been incredibly hyped and it's not quite as good as advertised, but no book could be as good as PDL is purported to be.<br />I typically read a chapter a day during my devotional time and I could see myself going through the book many times that way.<br />If you look hard enough you will find something that you will not agree with. Looking at some of the reviews I've read, lots of people have looked very hard and have gotten themselves all worked up over just these type of picayune details. But what you'll remember out of this book is the five purposes, and it's impossible to quarrel with those on doctrinal grounds.<br />The pastor of our Bible-believing church is encouraging all of us to read this book, and I'm glad he has. If Christians took the message of this book seriously we'd be a living demonstration of WWJD.	2004-01-30
