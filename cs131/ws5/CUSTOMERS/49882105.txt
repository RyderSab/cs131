The Tandy character was drawn rather well also, but I would have liked to see her at the end, the way I got to learn Manny's feelings about taking the action he'd been forced into.  I couldn't really connect with either Lauren or Ed.  Ed just struck me as a cold fish.  I would have liked to have seen his feelings at the end, too, so I could figure out the odds on the marriage surviving. <br /> <br />I can't put my finger on why Lauren seemed to distant to me.  I did like the way the authors painted her as moving cautiously forward by the book's end (rather than the everything's-just-dandy-now scenario, and I loved what she did to Tandy.  The book read smoothly, always a concern for me when there are co-authors. <br /> <br />All in all, not a bad way to spend reading time.	2004-08-24
US	49882105	R302QFMFRMVLYH	0312324294	517053561	Like the First Time: A Novel	Books	4	4	4	N	N	A story of three women and their problems with men . . .	No, it's not Rona Jaffe's &quot;The Best of Everything.&quot; It's not Jacqueline Susann's &quot;Valley of the Dolls.&quot; It *is* Francis Ray's &quot;Like the First Time.&quot;  <br />  <br /> Ms. Ray puts her own spin on the time-honored, popular theme in women's fiction. &quot;Like the First Time&quot; is actually more of a mainstream romance, which means none of the women gets so distraught over the actions of a man that she hangs herself or swallows a bottle of pills (like the aforementioned titles.) <br />  <br /> Clare, a lonely 39-year-old virgin, gets close to Gray while conducting business, and the attraction grows. But Gray holds back because He's Been Hurt. A typical romance plot, but to her credit, Ms. Ray paints a valid picture of Clare that doesn't make her status seem as incredulous as it sounds. She also throws in a family complication in the form of a character you'll love to hate. Ms. Ray also skillfully gives Clare more confidence in herself, a little at a time, where by the end of the story she's barely recognizable from the meek little milquetoast at the beginning. <br />  <br /> More interesting to me was Brooke and John. Brooke has no problem with confidence. She's also somewhat of a gold digger, but she's always likeable. John is a working stiff, a widower with two young children, including a very solemn son who was touchingly but subtly portrayed as being very deeply affected by the death of his mother. The outcome of these characters, like the first set, is never in doubt, but it's nice to see Brooke become a more caring person in the process. <br />  <br /> Most interesting to me was Lorraine, mainly because her outcome wasn't so clear. Ms. Ray also manages to give the reader insight into her unsupportive husband's (Hamilton) psyche and make him less unsympathetic. I still didn't like him, but at least I understood him better. <br />  <br /> As I write this review I realize this book's strength is its rich character development. There are a few secondary characters tossed in, your standard villians and bad guys, but Ms. Ray ties it all in beautifully in the book's closing chapters. <br />  <br /> Because no book is perfect, I must mention the typos, particularly in first third of the book. Misplaced commas confused some of the dialogue, making me unsure if the name mentioned was the person being addressed or the person being discussed. This threw me out of the story as I tried to figure it out. I found this annoying because I was so into the story. Fortunately, after a few times it stopped. I did find it amusing that when given ten minutes to change, Clare took &quot;a quick bath.&quot; I also wondered how Clare, who never had much money to spend on clothes, could tell with one glance that her nemesis was wearing an Armani suit. Was the label sewn on the outside? I notice these things because I savor a good story like this one, and whenever I read something improbable it stands out like someone wearing a kente cloth outfit to a funeral. <br />  <br /> Anyway, minor quibbles aside, this was a great book. Read it and enjoy!	2004-08-01

Woman on lurching plane nervously blabs all she feels guilty about to her seatmate, a perfect stranger, only to find out later that he owns the company she works for. This book was fun and thought-provoking (honesty is the best policy, and while it would be difficult to tell a friend you don't like the gifts they give you, but Emma's fibs were out of control. I had just a minimum of trouble understanding British terminology (I'm not going to say I can't understand English!) The ending was especially cute. I was, however, let down by Jack's Big Secret, which to me wasn't any big deal. <br /> <br />I notice that many readers who've read the Shopaholic series expressed disappointment in this book. I haven't read the series yet, but I intend to. I'm looking forward to it.  From the reviews I've read I might like these even better!	2004-08-01

Ms. Jaffe's writing style kept me eagerly turning pages.  I was sad for Susan, happy for Leigh, and sorry for both Vanessa and Cady.  But their personalities were set at the start of the story, and they didn't change very much over nearly forty years.  And at the end I just said, &quot;Well, that's it.&quot;  I didn't feel like I'd witnessed anything special, just forty years in the three women's lives.  Unlike some of the other readers who've posted reviews, I liked the surprise Ms. Jaffe threw in at the end.  I don't want to say too much, but the memories these women kept alive for so many years would have been forgotten like last week's newspaper had things gone differently.<br />I guess I would have liked to have understood Vanessa better.  She was such an enigma to me.  How does a person become so empty?  Cady, whom I felt was pitiful, was much better fleshed out.  Leigh's life was too perfect for much space to be devoted to.<br />I'm not a fan of adultery, but I believe Ms. Jaffe was trying to make a point that some married men really do divorce their wives, while others string girlfriends along as long as they are allowed to.<br />But yes, I did enjoy this book.	2004-05-16

I liked the two twists Ms. Phillips inserted early in the story:  Who Winnie was married to, and then Winnie's relationship to Sugar Beth.  The dialogue was wonderfully witty.<br />But the story wasn't without its flaws.  I simply didn't feel Sugar Beth's devotion to her elderly deceased husband, or to his mentally impaired daughter.  Maybe because this happened in the past and the author didn't paint a visual picture.  It was the one hole in an otherwise extremely well developed character.  Nor could I understand the Seawillows.  I don't see where Sugar Beth did anything for them to hate her so much, other than leave town and lose touch.  Winnie was the only one who had a right to hold a grudge.<br />But flaws aside, this was a great story of loss and redemption.	2004-05-07

I don't generally read romance, but this one was about black people, and I've always been a sucker for any type of story featuring rediscovered love.  This story was sweet and charming, but, oh, those typos!  Harlequin is one of the world's largest publishers.  I can't believe they allowed this book to go to press in this condition.  Do they think because it's about black people the readers won't notice?  Missing punctuation marks, capitalization errors, run-on sentences, and wrong words abounded (the feel of his *chair* when they meant *hair*).  The errors detracted from my enjoyment, often bouncing me out of the story.  Where did they get their typesetter from, a GED class?  And don't they have editors?  If it wasn't for this I would have given it four stars.  It really was a lovely story.<br />Aside from all the typos I only had two minor quibbles.  Little Dare sometimes spoke more like an adult than a 10-year-old child, especially in the beginning of the book.  And it seemed odd that one minute Shelly was noting how cool the October night air was, and on the very next page she's wondering why Dare hasn't been by at night in nearly a month to make love to her under the stars, safely away from the eyes of their son.  The question had already been answered, and I wanted to scream, &quot;BECAUSE IT'S OCTOBER AND IT'S TOO COLD TO BE NAKED OUTDOORS!&quot;   <br />This is definitely not your mother's Harlequin romance.  I always thought these novels were filled with flowery language, and while there were non-clinical euphemisms (there were a LOT of mentions of &quot;the area between her legs&quot;), this is one spicy book.  Also, I sensed a buildup for a subsequent story featuring one of the hero's brothers, which was handled very nicely and makes me want to read that as well.<br />Please, Harlequin, you owe it to your readers to print a better typeset book.	2004-03-16

I know now that would have been a terrible mistake.  This was one of the best books I've read this year (I rarely give books 5 stars.)  One day I started reading it in the bookstore and decided I had to know what happened to the people, so I purchased it and brought it home.  The author sucks the reader right in, convincingly writing from alternate viewpoints of the three main characters in present tense.  It is a beautifully written character study in which you will intimately get to know these people, warts and all, and that desire to know more will keep you turning the pages.  This is not a book for people who want a lot of action, but for those who enjoy a more emotional story, well told and highly visual.<BR>The best part of all is that it is so different from the author's previous effort, Rhythms.  This tells me that Donna Hill will not be content to write the same story over and over again with a little variation here and there (like E. Lynn Harris), but continue to give us engrossing stories that are new and different.<BR>If you enjoy good writing and excellent character development, this book is for you!	2003-04-09

US	49882105	R3HL7FND6XUSF0	0312306113	504346361	Ties That Bind: A Novel	Books	4	4	5	N	N	My kinda book!	A big, sweeping saga covering 37 years in the lives of a group of students at Howard University.  This novel's strong point is the expert plotting.  Everything came together beautifully (making the title even more significant), and in spite of the large number of major characters it is written in a fashion where the reader won't get confused.  It's been years since I read something so well put together, and I recommend this book for anyone who enjoys a good story.<br />Also a factor in this story's success is the research.  I had the feeling of actually being there.  I could actually see the beauty of the the island in South Carolina.  I could almost smell the ocean.  The numerous historical tie-ins accented the timeline nicely (but I had some difficulty accepting that the wife of an attorney would work as a flight attendant, not a particularly high-paying position and one that requires a lot of time away from home.)<br />As a reader I was really drawn into this book.  The characters seemed so real.  I truly cared about these people, and I feared for the safety of the three young men, one who became a Black Panther and two who went to Vietnam.  I soon realized that one of them virtually had to be eliminated for plot purposes, but nevertheless I was holding my breath!<br />There were plenty of wonderful touches.  Grandma Mattie's special gift, for instance.  The abundance of do-right African-American men, especially Harry, a minor character who is to be commended for putting up with Angela and standing by her when she needed him.  The family bible that was over 100 years old.     <br />So why four stars and not five?  For starters, a couple of things struck me as odd.  I was amazed when the story progressed to 2002 and three of Randolph's four grandparents were still alive (They'd all been elderly when first introduced in 1965.)  Randolph himself was nearly 60 in 2002.  His grandparents would likely about 100.  The bible notation said Miss Mattie married her husbandin 1922, 80 years before, and presuming her daughter was the same age or even a little older than the Fullers' son, then Julia and Robert Fuller would have been married at least 80 years and would be 100 or close to it at the least.  Yet neither Julia nor Robert were painted as being slow-moving and feeble, in spite of a stroke Julia suffered in 1970, 32 years before.  She and her husband walked to the study along with everyone else -- no mention of wheelchairs or canes, not even leaning on anyone for support.  The very fact that they were still alive at their age, much less walking under their own power, and married for more than three-quarters of a century are all achievements that deserved to be acknowledged.<br />I also felt the matter of a formal adoption of Haywood should have been addressed, at least Jenna and Randolph's reasons for not doing so, especially with him being an attorney.  Haywood asked Randolph if he would be her daddy when she was a small child and grew up calling him \\"Dad.\\"  She was described as having been close to her natural father, but she was only about 5 when he died and later alluded that he had been sick prior to his death, so how close could they have been?  Granted, an adoption making her a Fuller would have cast a somewhat distasteful pallor over the subsequent events that occurred when Haywood grew up, but I would have liked to seen an actual reason why she wasn't adopted other than it would have interfered with the plot. <br />Any project this ambitious needs meticulous editing, and I was jolted out of the story by some mistakes that should have been corrected.  The use of the present-day term \\"African-American\\" used in 1965.  (Afro-American, yes.  African-American, no.)  A great-grandchild referred to as a grandchild in a will.  A character concluding an emotional scene with \\"Now got [sic] out.\\"  The improbable term, \\"she said silently\\" not only jolted me out of the story, but practically out of the house.  I had to stop readinguntil the next day until I could get back into the story.  All of these and more should have been caught before publication.<br />I'd also like to see Ms. Jackson display a little more imagination in her writing to go along with her fabulous storytelling ability.  The use of the clichéd term \\"prim and proper\\" was used to utter excess in conjunction with Angela, and to a lesser extent with Julia.  I also got tired of the tendency to tell rather than show.  Ms. Jackson demonstrated a fondness for terms like \\"It was evident,\\" \\"Evidently,\\" \\"It was apparent,\\" \\"Clearly,\\" \\"It was indicated,\\" etc.  This grated on my nerves and in many cases represented unnecessary explanation, for the emotions or mood had been conveyed by the way the person spoke.  Finally, the author too often relied on these terms to show facial expressions, with statements like \\"It was evident that he (how he felt), and it was also evident that she (how she felt) as well,\\" or \\"shock was evident on her face.\\"<br />But those points aside, this was a very, very good book.  Read it.  It'll give you a warm, tingly feeling when you're done.	2003-02-20

As usual, Ms. Roby tells a riveting story I hated to put down and was anxious to get back to, with one big difference . . . this story was much better written than her previous works.  No jolting point of view changes and word overuse that plagued her earlier novels.  Granted, she still has an urge to explain character's motivation after their dialogue, passing up opportunity after opportunity to show this to the reader by describing their body language.  But it's a tremendous improvement.  Maybe she has a more attentive editor; her previous books had the feel of a rough draft.<br />This is a nicely constructed look at racism in contemporary society, those little covert incidents as well as the ones that are in our faces, cleverly incorporating the protaganist's private life in a largely corporate story, including her romantic relationships, her friendships, and little incidents of everyday life.<br />I didn't find the plot overstated, as some other readers have said.  But no book has ever struck me as without flaws.  There were some things that got to me.  She overused the phrase \\"I couldn't believe,\\" especially in the early part of the book where Anise was talking to her husband.  I wanted to say to her, \\"Believe it, baby!\\"  I also felt that the best friend was too pushy with her personal beliefs on divorce and interracial dating, especially when she had been divorced herself.  But I loved Anise's close relationship with her mother, which seemed especially poignant in light that the book is dedicated to the author's own recently deceased mother.  It's a valentine to mother-daughter relationships.<br />The major point I didn't like was the handling of the romantic relationship.  It moved too fast and therefore never rang true for me, you know, that too-good-to-be-true plot line.  Because of that I kept waiting for a bomb to go off.  I wasn't disappointed here, but I could have accepted the bomb more readily if the author hadn't rushed things but instead allowed a strong friendship to develop before dropping it.  (I don't mean to sound cryptic, I just don't want to spoil the plot for those who haven't read it yet). <br />I do recommend this book.  And I look forward to Ms. Roby's continued growth as a writer.	2003-02-01

This story educates the reader on Vietnamese culture without being preachy (similar to the way romance writer Beverly Jenkins educates her readers about 19th century black life), and the writing is so vivid you will feel as if You Are There witnessing the scenes between Jade's biological parents - who are little more than frightened children themselves in the center of a brutal war - in the early 1970s and Jade's fateful trip to Vietnam thirty years later.  An engrossing, heartwarming story that goes down smoothly and will raise your emotions, maybe even make your eyes grow damp.  Jade, Cameron, Jade's biological and adoptive parents all learn that life isn't always easy, but feeling comfortable about who you are and what you've done gives you a better shot at happiness.  I recommend it.	2003-01-04

Something about the plot left me kinda cold, or maybe it was the characters (I'm a little old to try to relate to characters in their 20s, the same age as my kids), or maybe it was the writing itself.  I found it annoying that I had to figure out who the &quot;I&quot; was at the beginning of each chapter.  And what's with all those tags?  He said, I said, he said, I said.

I love books about multiple female characters, and it's been a while since the last time I read a good one.  P.G. County is a chatty, gossipy book all about life in an exclusive Maryland enclave, and I loved every minute.  I think the book could have been better if it had had an epilogue, for the ending seemed a bit abrupt.  While I was satisfied with where Briscoe left off with Barbara, Candice, and Lee (and I had a feeling Daddy was who he turned out to be), I wanted to see the bad-girl character get her comeuppance, and see what happened with the developing romance, and with Bradford.  Oh, well.  I guess it's up to us to figure it out.<br />This book was a ton of fun, and I liked that the characters weren't young folks in their 20s, but instead late 30s to early 50s.  Somebody needs to snap this one up and make a movie!  Let's see . . . Sheryl Lee Ralph as Jolene, the newly slimmed-down Yvette Freeman (the nurse on E.R.) as Pearl (only because Loretta Devine already played an overweight hairdresser in Waiting to Exhale,) Lonette McKee as Barbara, Clark Johnson as Bradford, Phil Morris as Patrick . . .

That flowery language made me want to gag.  <br />If you like a good story, I recommend this book.  Don't be swayed by that unappealing dull cover or the theme of the family falling apart when Mama becomes ill that we've seen in the movies and read in other writer's books in the past five years or so.  If the love scenes nauseate you (or make you giggle), skip over them.  You'll be glad you did.<br />I'm impressed enough by this author to look forward to her next book.

There's nothing like a gurgling infant to make one believe the world must go on, no matter what you're feeling in your heart.<br />The story was well-written, but did contain some errors and typos that I found frustrating.  In an emotional moment, Madison tells Wes that he doesn't know what love \\"it,\\" which jarred me out of the story.  Most unfortunate was the use of \\"God\\" with a lower case \\"G.\\"  Early on in the book, I think on page 2, Madison was taking a shower and Wes knocked on the door.  With no mention of him moving away from her, on the next page Wes is suddenly crossing the room to stand a foot away from Madison (?#).  This made me say, \\"Oh no, not another badly edited African-American book,\\" but I'm glad I kept reading, for soon I was engrossed in the story.<br />This book started off very real, but the author's romance roots did become evident, especially in the ending.  I'm not really a romance fan, and here two secondary romances are included, a May-December relationship that had the cynic in me wondering why the girl's mother didn't go after the man herself instead of encouraging it (I certainly wouldn't want *my* daughter marrying someone old enough to be her father), which is featured rather prominently, the other mercifully only peeked at.  Fortunately, the use of those flowery romance terms like \\"manhood\\" and \\"womanhood\\" I find so silly were used minimally.  All the romances, including the main one, moved a little too quickly for my taste in a story with so much initial grit.  This will probably please Ms. Ray's romance readers, and while I didn't particularly care for this aspect I'm sure this book will bring her new fans.  I know I'll be looking for her next work of women's fiction.	2002-07-21

I also didn't like not finding out the outcome of the lawsuit for the family property in Texas.  But a very good read nonetheless.	2002-06-05
US	49882105	R9YWEUSX2X41E	1583142347	157252150	A Chocolate Affair	Books	2	1	1	N	N	Rather empty	Maybe I'm just not feeling it, but I don't understand what all the raves are about.  I read Chocolate Star, which wouldn't have been bad if it was written better.  The author mercifully cut back on the brand names and food descriptions (or maybe this time she received better editing), but the story line here was very thin.  It essentially resolved around setting up The Incident between Topaz and Sean, and then its aftermath, which was a cinch to predict.  Apparently, with the cliffhanger ending, the author intends to publish a series a la E. Lynn Harris.  I'm glad to see that so many are eagerly awaiting the next installment, but I won't be reading it.	2002-04-04
US	49882105	R1DSL2BFGIVS6J	0312967292	951130263	Chocolate Star	Books	1	11	11	N	N	Just awful	Like Kimberla Lawson Roby, Ms. Copeland is a good storyteller with poor writing skills.  Much of this book read like a list.  Every time food was served, and this was often, the entire menu was listed.  One well-known name could never be mentioned; there always had to be one of those doggone lists.  \\"The Arsenio Hall Show, The Tonight Show, Oprah.\\"  Or \\"Jheryl Busby, Quincy Jones, Eddie Murphy, Al B. Sure, Cuba Gooding, Jr., Jam and Lewis, L.A. and Babyface.\\"  Or \\"Chanel, Saint Laurent, Chloe, Christian Dior, Hermes, Givenchy.\\"<br />The name dropping got old real fast.  Every time luggage or a wallet was mentioned it was preceded by the words \\"Louis Vuitton.\\"  (I think this designer is one of the author's personal favorites; a trivia game could be established counting the number of times she mentions it.)  Ms. Copeland obviously was hoping her readers would drool over the descriptions of Italian furniture, Chinese rugs, pink marbled bathrooms, ad nauseam, or else she believes her readers are as shallow as Gunther and Topaz.  Lines like \\"They pulled up in front of a four-bedroom house,\\" or \\"Don't you think it's time we started getting ready for the Natalie Cole concert at the Bowl?\\" are showing off merely for the reader's benefit.  It is impossible for someone to drive up to a house and know how many bedrooms it has.  And anyone who was asking their spouse to get ready would simply say, \\"for the concert,\\" because the spouse would already know who is performing and where.  I haven't seen anything so blatant since the Huxtable family had that Princeton fixation (it was never \\"school,\\" always \\"Princeton.\\")  <br />The writing is extremely amateurish.  There is nothing creative about not using, \\"he/she said.\\"  But no one \\"said\\" anything in this book.  They barked, yelled, repeated, suggested, sang softly (?!), commented, joined in, protested, scolded, replied, questioned, asked, shouted, squealed, mumbled, admonished, heard voices proclaim (?!), laughed, giggled, promised, offered, commanded, rattled off...but never SAID.<br />Cliches were rampant, another mark of the amateur.  Pleased as Punch, cool as ice, like a kid in a candy store, sugary sweet.  How did this get published?<br />The point of view bounced back and forth like a tennis ball.  Dialogue was usually accompanied with empty descriptions of emotions, i.e. \\"She couldn't believe it.\\"  \\"She was sincere.\\"  \\"She was livid.\\"  If Ms. Copeland knew anything about writing she would know that the first rule of writing is show, don't tell!  But yet every time a character was introduced their complexion was described, even people who were just passing through, like customer service clerks.  What's up with that? <br />The use of \\"Dang\\" REALLY got on my nerves.  In the end I found myself skipping through the endless lists and empty emotions just to see Gunther and Topaz get their comeuppance.<br />But, hey, considering all the readers who thought this book was fabulous, maybe I'm just being too picky to expect good writing.	2002-03-16
US	49882105	R2LZ3LXUDGKGHD	0743214331	528703759	Satin Doll: A Novel	Books	3	2	4	N	N	Promising debut	I liked the idea of a young woman who can rise above a daunting childhood to success.  I felt the book was better plotted and written than any originally self-published book I'd read before, but regardless it was below the standards of an E. Lynn Harris or Bebe Moore Campbell.<br />The most glaring example of this was the excessive use of various &quot;tags,&quot; i.e., &quot;Regina snapped,&quot; &quot;Puddin' drawled,&quot; &quot;Angela yelled,&quot; &quot;Renee shouted,&quot; &quot;Regina thundered,&quot; &quot;Puddin' offered,&quot; &quot;Regina cried,&quot; &quot;Regina laughed,&quot; &quot;Renee pointed,&quot; &quot;Regina shorted,&quot; etc., or HOW it was said, i.e. &quot;Regina said slowly,&quot; &quot;Charles said defensively,&quot; &quot;Puddin asked soothingly,&quot; &quot;Regina said wearily,&quot; &quot;Brenda said quickly,&quot; or including an action in the same breath as dialogue, i.e., &quot;he said, reaching for the door,&quot; &quot;Tamika said, leaning over the table to give her friend a hug,&quot; &quot;Regina said, putting down her brush and turning in her chair,&quot; &quot;Charles said, kissing Regina on the forehead,&quot; etc.  This type of thing is amateurish.<br />Several things about the plot I found disagreeable.  The incident bringing Regina and Yvonne back together was too pat.  I would have liked to see more of Puddin'.  Most of all, I didn't like the big revenge scene Regina set up, thought it was silly.<br />I do feel this author has a promising future and will be interested in seeing how her future work improves.	2002-01-16

In the end I found this to be the least interesting of the three stories.  I was jolted out of reading by several careless errors.  In the first few pages, a speaker attribution was credited to the sister who was actually the TOPIC of conversation, but was not present.  Another error had me confused about the storyline, when in talking to the niece the sister mentions &quot;your grandmother's funeral,&quot; making me think the sisters' mother who caused the rift was dead.  When she popped up alive later, I supposed that the sister meant it was HER grandmother who died, who would have been her niece's GREAT-grandmother.<br />The second story started off cute and had a very funny scene on an airplane, but by the time I got to the ending I had lost interest.  The ending struck me as flat.<br />The third story worked best for me.  The ending wasn't mushy, flat, or both.  It was less predictable than the other two.  But there was an error in that one too, another case of dialogue credited to the wrong sister (who wasn't even present at the time.)  I am amazed at how many errors I find in books today.  Doesn't anyone proofread anymore?  It drives me nuts when I'm into a book, reading about a conversation between &quot;John&quot; and &quot;Mary&quot; ABOUT &quot;Susie,&quot; and suddenly &quot;Susie&quot; says something.  When did she come in?  The answer is that she didn't; it's &quot;Mary&quot; who's talking.  Please, authors, pay attention to what you're writing!  It'll make reading your books a lot more enjoyable.	2001-11-24

The book split in half before I was done.<BR>TLM is an interesting character study of a man (Robin Stone) with obvious psychological problems, plus three of the women who love him.  Amanda is pitiful, Maggie is a little off the wall, and Judith is, as another review put it, pathetic.<BR>While this book was very well put together (there is plenty of information about Robin and the other women in his life, as well as secondary characters, spread thoughout each of the three sections,) I did have a few problems.  I really didn't understand the Maggie character.  I didn't understand why Robin called Judith suddenly after brushing her off.  The editing was poor.  Paragraph breaks that clearly needed to be there weren't.  Missing punctuation abounded.  When Robin underwent hypnosis and talked as a child, his vocabulary was way too sophisticated for a child who had just turned five.<br />I have to say that it is not as engrossing as Valley of the Dolls (Susann's masterpiece,) but it is a very close second.  I especially liked how no loose ends were left at the end.<br />What a tragedy that Ms. Susann's death came so early.  How wonderful it would be if she could have given us more wonderful stories to read.	2001-11-12

I'm not sorry I did, but the premise started to fall flat as I kept saying to myself, &quot;There's nobody they can call about these occurrences, even anonymously?&quot;  And the ending was over the top.  Why would anyone who'd been through what Barry had been through with these people go into that house, especially after that creepy annual meeting?<br />Anyway, I can't say I'm sorry I read it, but it could have been better.	2001-10-22

I loved reading about all the family members' personalities, some of which were very familiar.  My favorite part was the reunion itself, when all the main characters were together.  There was more fun stuff going on at the end, at the wedding of a cousin; plus a big surprise at a family meeting.  After the reunion the story turns to resolving the personal crises of the cousins in romance-novel fashion, with some overly long, somewhat repetitive love scenes.  But the general theme running throughout the story is a strong sense of family that can bring tears to one's eyes.  It's all about love.	2001-10-17

It looks like it might be the end of the Basil/Yancey franchise (I'm not so sure about Ava.) If that's true it's right on time. I do feel that Yancey's newfound love seemed a little forced, but I hope the change in her ways is permanent. While I don't think I'd want to read another book with them as the main characters, I'd love it if the author did an update on them in a future book so I know how things worked out.	2001-09-23

I'm giving it 3-1/2 stars rather than 4 because a) I didn't think it was realistic for Graham to essentially do nothing when his mother continually snubbed Amanda, b) I didn't like the suggestion that a pregnancy will result just by relaxing.  I also guessed the identity of the father and think it would have been better if there had been on other obvious suspect.  But it was a good read, and overall I enjoyed it.	2001-09-16

I did find the first two women's stories more interesting than the third, and I was kind of disappointed when the story ended somewhere in the 1970s instead of the present day.<BR>There are just a few technical problems. Numerous spelling or word errors were distracting (&quot;bare&quot; down instead of bear down, &quot;formerly&quot; for formally, &quot;worst&quot; for worse, &quot;Shriver's Row&quot; for Striver's Row, etc.)and really should have been caught before publication. An inherited trait mentioned throughout the book is an eye color of green, like jade, described as sparkling like the stone; but jade, while pretty, is dull and doesn't sparkle. I found myself picturing emeralds instead whenever this was mentioned. An awkwardly long metaphor about a Japanese chef in a sushi shop made me crack up, but I was an English major and notice things like that.<BR>But overall it was a thoroughly entertaining story, and I liked it and will read more by this author.	2001-08-29

It says that Joan Fontaine won an Academy Award for To Have and Have Not.  Audrey Hepburn is not included on the list of actresses who won Oscars for first films or first leading roles.  It lists all three African-American actors who won for Best Supporting Actor, but on the very next page declares that only two actors, Denzel Washington and Cuba Gooding, Jr., won, suddenly forgetting about Lou Gossett.  Marie Dressler died in 1934, not 1933.  It goes on and on.  This book could have been a wonderful reference, but with all these mistakes it's undependable.	2001-08-07
US	49882105	R10MJ1JPUFBH2D	0312868065	719442305	A Dark Secret	Books	3	2	3	N	N	Over the top	An entertaining read, and while I was anxious to find out what happened next, I found some the characters to be unreal.  For the most part I found Camille, the main character, unlikeable, with all those machinations and sneaky maneuvers to prevent her mountain of lies from being uncovered.  Her desperation to be accepted no matter what the cost suggested a deep-rooted psychological problem.  While I did feel sorry for her because her mother was so unloving, I never understood why she would want to get into a family who so clearly disliked blacks.  Nor did I understand why Camille and Jeff simply sat there when his father repeatedly insulted her, and stayed when his mother said she felt it best that they leave.<br />Mrs. Stone's habit of punctuating every other sentence with &quot;gracious&quot; got on my nerves big time.  Both she and Mr. Stone struck me as caricatures, as did the maid Ida Mae.<br />Good pacing and more engrossing than the author's previous book &quot;Dark Chocolate,&quot; but I hope her next effort is a little less over the top.	2001-08-05

I could even live with the critics' warnings that the characters were only ten years older in 1987 than they had been when the first story ended.  That was grossly incorrect.  The original Valley started in September 1945.  Anne was 20, Neely 17.  When it ended on New Years' Day 1965 Anne was 39 and Neely 36.  Fast forward 22 years.  Anne is 34 and Neely younger than that, so they weren't 10 years older, they were YOUNGER.  A dozen lost years I could deal with, but this is just silly.  Trying to cram the original story in a span of 3 or 4 years is impossible (and will someone tell Ms. Lawrence it was Kevin GILLMORE, not GILLIAN, who founded the Gillian cosmetics line.)  Some snappy dialogue here and there, the same ridiculous fear of aging (I know some people age fast, but the average 35-year-old does NOT need to see a plastic surgeon to remove forehead lines,) and a few couple of good, unexpected plot turns, but at the end I was left with an empty feeling, i.e., &quot;Is that all there is?&quot;	2001-07-04

Minuses were that I really didn't feel I knew the main character very well; I knew more about two of the possible suspects than I did about her.

She writes about timely issues such as the sandwich generation who must care for ill parents as well as their own young children that I feel many people can relate to, and she makes the reader care about her characters, but her weakness continues to be her poor writing style.  The characters show no display of emotion, the reader is merely told through narration and the sometimes clumsy overuse of adverbs, how they feel and what their motives are (&quot;she said worriedly,&quot; &quot;he said unenthusiastically,&quot; &quot;she said unimpressively,&quot; &quot;he said angrily,&quot; &quot;she said contentedly,&quot; &quot;he said suspiciously,&quot; &quot;he said cold-bloodedly,&quot; &quot;he asked disappointedly,&quot; etc., usually followed by a thought or motive like, &quot;trying to lift their spirits,&quot; &quot;getting upset,&quot; &quot;hoping he wasn't going to cause any trouble,&quot; &quot;reaching for any chance he could grab hold of.&quot;  I'm still trying to figure out how someone can be irate and cry hysterically at the same time.  Of course, it was never explained why Rick wouldn't commit (although Samantha's constant broad hinting about matrimony was getting on my nerves as well,) or why Gina had such low self-esteem to stay with Phillip in the first place. <br />It also bugged me that many of the questions were prefaced with the word &quot;So.&quot;  People may actually talk this way, but they also pepper their speech with &quot;you know,&quot; which you never see in dialogue.<br />It is interesting how different writers can think up similar plots at around the same time.  I read a book earlier this year along the same theme of a mother who was ill and the issues of her adult children, with sexual abuse by a stepparent being a major issue in one child's life.  These books were almost certainly being written at the same time (even though the other book was much better written and had better character development,) but I hope this doesn't start a trend in black fiction where every book you pick up is about a parent who is in failing health and needs care while the children squabble.<br />P.S.  Am I the only one who was surprised that boh of the sisters knew how much the other earned?  That's something I consider highly personal.	2001-06-05

She writes with her usual intriguing style that immediately pulls in the reader, and I knew that her portrayal of slaves who were afraid of freedom would draw criticism from some, but personally, I thought her description of young Clara's day dreams of freedom and prosperity countered well with the viewpoint of older slaves who had not known any other type of life and had the fear of the unknown.  We've all seen the depictions of people who worked in the fields, but this is the first one I've seen of people who worked in the homes.  It never occurred to me that the personal maids were on call 24 hours a day.  No wonder white folks were so upset when they lost their unpaid servants; they literally didn't lift a finger.<br />What I didn't like was that there was a big hole in the story, namely that the circumstances behind Clara's two pregnancies were never explained.  I believe that was a major gaffe, and it nearly ruined the book for me.<br />Overall, I found this book to be both entertaining and enlightening.	2001-04-29
US	49882105	R1NU5CET1Q6SQR	1575664895	824287693	Casting The First Stone	Books	2	10	11	N	N	A good idea done in by bad writing	After reading this book and the earlier works of this author, I can understand why she was originally self-published after being told that she had some talent by publishers she approached.  She weaves a good tale, but unfortunately lacks the skills to carry it off.  Her editor was not much help; the writing is still amateurish.<br />I've personally never been a fan of the all-knowing narrator who tells what the characters are thinking, i.e., &quot;she asked, remembering what day it was&quot; or &quot;he commented, obviously shocked to hear that her husband was a minister.&quot;  As a writer she is supposed to paint a visual picture of the shock, not merely narrate; anyone can do that.  I also got tired of sentence fragments beginning with the word &quot;which.&quot;  She's also quite fond of the word &quot;and.&quot;<br />Another big issue was that of character development.  The man Tanya flirted with had no personality whatsoever; I suspect his only purpose was the part he played in the end of the story.  I thought the book started out with a bang, with Tanya and Curtis being so happy after his proposal and then fast forwarding eight years to her glaring at him in church.  I expected to learn what happened in those eight years to change their feelings via flashbacks, but nothing was explained.  It's not as interesting when you have no idea why characters behave the way they do.  I thought Curtis was merely a raving lunatic.<br />In my opinion, this writer needs to learn her craft.  I expected to see improvement when she was picked up by a major house, but I guess the editors feel that it will sell, no matter how badly executed it is, and they're probably right.  I'll continue to check out her books from the library and hope they get better.	2001-04-29

The oldest, highly successful sister who supports her mother financially (perhaps with a pattern toward geographical names, it was &quot;Savannah&quot; in Waiting to Exhale,) the substance-abusing brother, the materialistic sister who has remained in the family's hometown (wonder what Rosalyn McMillan thinks about the portrayal of the second oldest girl, the one who chose marriage over college but wants the nicest house in town, hates her decent-paying but unfulfilling job, is fiercely jealous of her older sister's success AND who considers going into the same field she is in. Hmmm) and, of course, the mother figure with whom I am the most familiar, having been exposed to her personality in the book Mama.<br />Still, the personalities are intriguing.  The Cecil and Janelle characters are new, at least; and it's nice to have some interaction with children.  More information is offered with regard to Lewis and Charlotte; McMillan gives good background information on why they are the way they are.  Unlike some other readers, I don't feel there was male-bashing; I felt Lewis was a very sympathetic character.  The family tree in the front and back can be frightening, but many of the people listed there are only mentioned occasionally.  It comes in handy, since the book is written in first person and we are not told which character's point of view we are in at the start of each chapter.  The mention of a spouse or child's name will help readers determine who's thoughts are being expressed.<br />Without saying too much, I thought the description of what happened to (character) was excellent.  It will probably soothe anyone who has experienced a loss.  (Okay, if you know anything about the author's life you will know which character I'm referring to.)  I also liked the book's ending.  Some have said it was pat, but we've all had moments where life was copasetic.  People still had their problems, but they were able to put them aside temporarily to enjoy being with family. <br />A very good read, but I do believe these personalities have been written about to the max and hope McMillan's next offering will introduce some new people.	2001-02-15

I would have liked to see a little more character development; I didn't feel like I knew them that well.  With so many major characters, this book could have been a lot longer.  Maybe the author was going for the breezy summer read; I don't know.<br />One thing I absolutely loved was the surprise about the identity of the girl in the prologue!

I almost always enjoy stories about two, three, or four friends (I won't use the term &quot;girlfriend&quot; because there's a negative connotation attached to it, for reasons I don't really understand; it's been around since &quot;Little Women&quot; in the 1800s) provided their problems interest me.<br />I did start getting a little restless around the middle of the story.  I don't know if the narration was excessive, as some readers have pointed out below.  What did frustrate me was the constant point of view changes throughout the book.  One minute I was in Regina's mind, being told how she felt, the next, in the same scene, I was in Russell's.  I did not get the feeling that the story was being told by an omnipresent narrator; there was no real distance between myself and the characters.<br />Anyway, I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys reading about girlfriends, (just remember this is about a trio of fortyish women whose problems are those of the more mature.  This is NOT a story about women looking for mates, which has probably been done to death!)	2000-12-30
US	49882105	R14UF3SAW40FL0	0060198346	794635347	The Sky Is Falling: A Novel	Books	2	0	1	N	N	The quality is falling!	This book never sat right with me.  It seemed lacking somehow.  The same choppy sentences, the same suspenseful ending, the same annoying habit of peppering the narrative with &quot;Dana saids&quot; or Dana did whatever when it's obvious she is the one speaking or acting.   Therefore, it had to be the plot.  Maybe I'm just getting accustomed to figuring them out, the good guy persona that's really masking an evil mind, etc.  I did guess who the bad guys were, but I also never felt like I got to know Dana like I got to know the heroines of other Sheldon novels.  The story wasn't very deep.  There were too many characters (I had to keep flipping back pages to see who was who,) or maybe my confusion was because they weren't fleshed out enough.) I didn't have a problem with Jeff being with Rachel; for her to insist he not spend time with her in her time of need would be cruel.  Besides, it got him out of the way while Dana was globe trotting.  I did have a problem with Dana's leaving Kemal in the care of a woman she knew nothing about, and not making taking him to a doctor as soon as she realized he was unnaturally sleepy, but perhaps the rich really are different regarding indifference to their children and content to leave them in the care of nannies. I was very disappointed and was glad I borrowed this from the library.  Perhaps Sidney Sheldon, whom I believe is in his 80s, is slowing down, at least with his plotting if not with his research.  Maybe he just wore himself out visiting each locale (I read he does this, no matter how briefly the specific location is mentioned.)  Next time a story without so many locations might work better and give us a less predictable plot.	2000-11-25

Wow.  Talk about division.  I did find these tidbits about the upper class interesting.  Much of their attitudes struck me as silly, but I won't take this out on the author.<br />However, the author makes at least two references to Isabel Powell in which he describes her as the &quot;widow&quot; of Adam Clayton Powell, Jr.  She was actually the first of three or four wives.  His widow would be whoever he was married to at the time of his death.	2000-11-19
US	49882105	RT40D5WOYSWGZ	0451200489	787789104	Close Encounters	Books	4	1	1	N	N	Nobody does emotion like Sandra Kitt	Sandra Kitt was my introduction to contemporary African-American romance fiction with her classic &quot;Adam and Eva.&quot;  I have read (or tried to read) all her subsequent books, many of which, for reasons unknown, have started with the letter 'S'.  Some I liked, some I didn't, some I had to struggle through and others I just couldn't get into at all.  This is, in my opinion, the best of her mainstream books.  It moved a bit slow, but was always interesting, and I never lost the desire to find out what happened next.  I did find myself wondering if Carol or Lee had any friends; none were mentioned.  But it was very enjoyable story, both sweet and grounded in stark reality, and I would recommend it.	2000-11-16
US	49882105	RGLFL44H8YE4A	0312202911	620382425	Far From the Tree	Books	4	4	4	N	N	at least twelve million stories of black life . . .	...this has been one of them.  An entertaining, well-written tale of how one woman's demons have affected her and her family.  As in their previous effort, Tryin' to Sleep in the Bed You Made, there were plenty of clues planted about what was going to happen, and as in that book they were so skillfully done that when things actually did happen I was caught surprised.  There's a lot more subjects to write about than the looking-for-love type of story.<br />My only complaint is that math is clearly not the authors' strong point.  It is not possible for a couple who married in 1957 to be married 44 years in 2000, since that time period only involves 43 years.  It is also not possible for there to be a daughter not born until after the marriage to be 46 years old.  Because of this I kept waiting for it to be revealed that Celeste was illegitimate and fathered by someone other than Will Frazier, and when I realized it was just an error I found myself annoyed.  I think the editor should have noticed this; it would have been very easy to move the North Carolina years back from '57 to '53 without any affect on the story (there was no tie-in to anything historic.)<br />All in all, I enjoyed reading Far From the Tree.	2000-10-30

The situation of one story struck me as highly improbable.  Another proudly mentioned &quot;Shriver's Row&quot; (should be Striver's.)  Incidentally, mentioning these two blocks must be considered hip, every story except one either had characters living there or with office space there.<br />Entertaining stories, but a second pair of eyes before publication never hurts!	2000-09-27

Lynn Harris book (can't remember which one)  and enjoyed it.  This seemed a lot less serious than the other one.  It  reminded me of Sidney Sheldon, only shorter.  The bad guys went over the  top toward the end, which seems to be the standard in this type of book  (come on . . . attempted murder?) but it was fun, if predictable (how many  of you knew what was coming next when Yancey asked her ex why his sister  wouldn't continue taking care of the baby?) I was actually glad it wasn't  too long, because I was determined to finish it quick so I could find out  what happened!	2000-09-19

I liked Felicia Mason's story the best (felt it was the most realistic,) followed  by Donna Hill's, and Francis Ray's (even though the connection to the salon  in this particular story was practically non-existent).  Rochelle Alers'  heroine's inability to figure out the obvious was off-putting to me, but  hey, nobody's perfect.	2000-08-16

He obviously makes more money  than the President, the Chief Justice and the heads of the CIA and the FBI.   CPW is prime real estate that starts in the mid to upper six figures and  goes into the millions.  Parking for one vehicle in midtown Manhattan can  easily run $600, and this dude has two.  But it's somebody else who's being  dishonest?  Yeah, right.<br />Also, why is Della bemoaning that she can't  reach Louis, from whom she bought the business (he's on a two-month cruise,  not of the expansive Pacific, but of the small Caribbean, something else  that struck me as implausible.  Two weeks, yes.  Two months, no.)  It's her  accountant she needs, but she dismisses him as being the best in the  business, apparently deciding not to bother him with such a trivial matter  as owing the IRS $75,000.  Maybe she should give up this great guy and go  with H&amp;R Block, who advertise that their people will answer any IRS  questions in case of an audit.<br />Again, I only read this one story.  It was  a huge disappointment after reading Rosie's Curl and Weave, a book that  managed to be both enjoyable and believable.  I do plan on reading the  other stories, but not right away.	2000-08-16

It is an absolute riot.  People looked at me like I was nuts when I would suddenly break out laughing.  The gay  aspect is not explicit.  Joe Keenan, whom I believe is now the head writer  for &quot;Fraser,&quot; is one talented fellow.	2000-06-11

First, a drawing of a woman's lower body where one leg is shapely and the other chunky is a turn-off.  The cover is also misleading; it suggests that the model (I presume it was supposed to be the  model because the legs were so long) was black, which might have caused  confusion among readers.  Then there was that ridiculous blurb by the  publisher comparing Ms. Woolridge to Bebe Moore Campbell and Olivia  Goldsmith.  I personally am tired of these characterizations.  Ms.  Woolridge has her own style, and it's excellent. I found this book very  enjoyable.  It described the good life without getting caught up in a lot  of brand names like so many other authors like to do (though maybe a little  heavy on name-dropping of actual people.)  The story was engrossing, I kept  telling myself I would read &quot;just one more chapter&quot; when it was  time for lights-out.  I felt the events leading up to the conclusion were a  little over the top (Stephanie's behavior), but I recommend this book  highly.	2000-04-26

It had a mystery that was a cinch to figure out, threw ridiculously broad hints about something fishy that was  going on and had lots of &quot;he thoughts&quot; and &quot;she  thoughts.&quot;  I'm not surprised it was a quick sell, but where was the  editor?  I do think it would make an entertaining film in the hands of a  qualified screenwriter, for the story itself was interesting.	2000-04-15

How this woman was able to take on the voice of a 13-year-old kid from the inner city just amazes me.  This book deserves to get a lot more attention that it has.
