US	52084897	R3JF7DFNBZLEPQ	0060008024	568824372	Angels	Books	4	3	4	N	N	Another treat from Marian Keyes	Marian Keyes is the best!  She has given us several fabulous, funny novels in the last few years (even releasing them in the UK and US at different times to keep us on our toes) and her latest is a speedy, enjoyable read as well.<br />Maggie Walsh is an unhappy wife living in Dublin, Ireland. Maggie has just discovered her husband has been unfaithful AND gets the sack from her bad job; her crazy family (characters we met in 'Watermelon' and 'Rachel's Holiday') is no comfort so she decides to take some downtime in Los Angeles with her best friend Emily who lives there, working as a screenwriter.  Maggie is a bit different from the rest of Keyes' past characters; instead of just dabbling in illicit drugs, booze and sex, Keyes introduces some different plots.  We see some bondage, a bit of lesbianism, venereal disease and abortion.  Plus, there are not just perfect guys in this story...there a few jerks too.  Maggie totally immerses herself in the LA Scene and tries out quite a few new things.  All this with a happy ending to boot!  I was so happy when I finished this but now I am sad b/c I have no more unread Marian Keyes books.<br />Oh well, I'll just have to re-read 'Rachel's Holiday' again!	2002-08-07

The characters in 'Talking To Addison' were sooo boring and the storyline lost me many times. Quite frankly, Holly needed a good slap and I really hoped that Addison did NOT wake from his coma.	2002-07-08

Elizabeth is a 'nice private school girl' who lives with her mum outside Sydney.  She communicates with everyone in the story via notes/letters/postcards including the letters she composes to herself from the &quot;Teenagers who are about to Fail High School&quot; and the &quot;Cold Hard Truth Society&quot; (examining just about the same angst-ridden situations we all felt back at that age).  <BR>You'll have to read it to see if YOU feel sorry for Celia too.	2002-06-25

I'm happy to say that I sped through the story in less than 2 days and was thoroughly satisfied by the author's character definition - she made the characters interesting and not boring at all.<br />Zoe is a 23 year-old orphan, na√Øve and unsure of herself.  She is dating a man who is not everything she hoped he would be.  Jenny is in her late 30's, a mother and wife but seemingly trapped by her own demons and an unhappy marriage.  Nadia is a free spirit, older and wiser than Zoe but not as hopeless as Jenny.  She is at the time in her life where she thinks she knows what she wants but just isn't quite sure how to get the ball rolling.  These three women have nothing in common except that they all live in and around London and become the victims of the same stalker.  <br />I really have to go now and find another of Nicci French's books!	2001-07-03

I remember the way I felt after finishing our assigned reading  (&quot;The Jungle&quot; by Upton Sinclair) in 11th grade English.  While in `The Jungle', Sinclair was discussing the merits of socialism amongst the poor and hungry in Chicago's meatpacking industry in the early 1900's, I am not exactly sure what Schlosser's overall message is.  Perhaps I was distracted by thinking about all those times I have eaten at Burger King and McDonald's.  I will certainly think twice before hitting the fast food place for a meal again.	2001-06-12

I dare anyone in my age group to dismiss the story as pure fiction.  I could find a bit of myself and many of my friends in this story, and it was reassuring to read about someone else (even a fictional character) who had similar struggles controlling herself at the 1/2 price sale at Macy's last week - thank you Sophie Kinsella!<br />Why, just today I was at the Crate &amp; Barrel outlet convincing myself that while I do not actually need a silver plated ice bucket, at $24.99 it is a true bargain not to be passed up (I bought it).  But - I digress...back to the review. You may not love this story - you could find this story trite or predicable or you may just be tired of all the `Brit-Lit' characters - but I guarantee you will be entertained and won't be bored by Rebecca Bloomwood.	2001-06-12

I loved everything about it.  Cannie (Candace) is an entirely likable character.  She is 28, newly single, career-driven and kind of chunky.  <br />When her ex-boyfriend decides to chronicle their love-life in his new magazine article titled `Loving a Larger Woman', Cannie's self-loathing tendencies begin to show.  An excellent supporting cast of characters helps tell Cannie's story and you'll laugh out loud as you read about this strong woman's path to happiness and self-discovery.

If you are looking to get your Sex In the City fix with this book, don't bother.  The first character introduced was fun but I struggled to get through her story.  As the book went on, I actually felt cheated by the lame-o storylines and going-nowhere plots.  Thank God I got it from the library and didn't have to shell out $$ for this one.<br />Just be patient and wait for the new season to start on HBO.	2001-04-09

I just finished this book last night and it really moved me.  The subject, a male twin who loses his penis due to a messy circumcision, is sexually re-assigned and is raised as a girl.  At age 14 or so, he learns the truth about himself and decides to become male again.<br />While some of the more technical information in the story bored me a bit, I was riveted by the biographical chapters in the book.  The author researched the history of sex reassignment and trans-gender studies in the US and Canada and explained and also told David's story wonderfully.<br />There are also a few photographs included in this book that I could not help turning back to.	2001-04-04

The writing style was excellent - there was good character definition and just the right amount of detail, but I was still disappointed.  I gave Claudia several chances to shape up and she just kept letting me down.  I guess I'm just tired of all the 20-something characters out there that are really really really stupid and can't stop getting themselves into trouble.  I couldn't handle Claudia's self-destructive drinking/drugging/sex with losers/rent-evading/mom-hating habits.  Her lame-o excuses for her crappy career and lack of attention to detail drove me up the wall.  Even her cat hated her!	2001-03-26

Marian Keyes gave her a drug and alcohol problem and then stuck her in a recovery treatment center in Ireland.  I learned so much from this fictional character as she learned the ropes in 'the program', cooking and cleaning and doing her part while examining the lives of her fellow addicts.  Rachel is in serious denial for the first portion of the book and thinks her problem is really everyone else's.  She finally comes to the realization that she truly does need help and her journey begins from there.  Enjoy!	2001-03-26

The title character (The Man...) is Wally, who decides to prove his love to a woman by eating a 747 airplane that crash-landed on his farm several years ago.  Why he decides that this will finally garner her attention after 20-odd years of unrequited love, we do not know.<br />J.J. is 'keeper of the records' of the famous record book who learns about Wally's feat in an anonymous letter and decides to travel to Superior, Nebraska in an effort to verify Wally's actions, revive his slumping career and try to figure out just WHY a man would eat a plane - true love or no true love.<br />I can't tell you much more of the plot as it may ruin the story for you.  The author draws you in with random Book of Records facts and gives plenty of detail to his oddball cast of characters and the townsfolk.  Superior, Nebraska is a bit like Twin Peaks without the creepy aspects thrown in (unless you equate eating a plane with creepiness).	2001-03-26

The author takes us backwards in time, tracing the origin of a (might-be) Vermeer painting.  The players in each of the eight stories have full character development and each describe the beauty that has come into their lives along with the painting - you almost might be rooting for one or the other to be able to hold on to this precious work of art.  An unanswered question looms for the reader at the end - and whether the painting was destroyed or not is a secret the author has kept from the reader.	2001-01-23

It ties fact w/ fiction in Buffalo in 1901, when this city was truly a force to be reckoned with.  The author does an excellent job making the reader feel as though they are actually strolling through Delaware Park or exploring the Falls.  I was disappointed with the ending, as I feel the heroine could have made better choices and changed her fate.  All, in all I rate it 4 stars for this first-time novelist.	2000-11-30

I found the premise of this book to be quite unbelievable...but maybe I'm just a little too Roman Catholic.  I did not identify with a single character and was frankly a little disgusted with the main character at the end.  Only 17, she made the most un-wise choices I think a 10 year old would have handled the situation better.

If you  like a quick and scary read that will keep you turning the pages until you  absolutely HAVE to put the book down, this is the story for you.  In Philip  Margolin's newest novel, we have a typical smart/young/maybe a bit naive  heroine along with some sketchy characters - several of which could  possibly be the killer!  The setting is the Portland, Oregon area, same as  in his last best-seller &quot;Gone But Not Forgotten&quot; and we see our  lead and other characters in courtroom, hospital and social settings.  Short chapters kept me going but would have appreciated a bit more  character development.  All in all, I rate this a better-than-average  novel.	2000-09-07

Mousy Nancy starts to mistakenly receive  mail, flower deliveries and phone calls for Barbie Doll Nancy and decides  to try on the glamorous lifestyle for a change.
