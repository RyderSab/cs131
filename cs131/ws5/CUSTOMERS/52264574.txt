Lee Covington gives the man contemplating divorce a very thorough and helpful guide.  She treats things with humor, but underneath are some very helpful tips and warnings.  She uses examples of three different kinds of wife and how to handle each one, including the one who may shoot the man.  It is not a substitute for actual legal advise (from a lawyer who is not a friend or acquaintance).  Buy it and send it in plain wrapper to the workplace of a friend who is going through, or about to go through, a divorce.  Buy it for yourself, but hide it from your present wife.	2005-08-12

His mother has tried everything, including reading a story about a mama bear with three cubs who won't hibernate like they should.  The mother goes to sleep, and Thomas is reading the book all by himself when the hungry mother bear jumps out of the book and is replaced by Thomas's mother, who is asleep inside the book with the three cubs. <br />Mama bear goes into the kitchen and loads up on the food there and then tries to swap with Thomas's mother, but it doesn't work.  Finally both mothers are returned to their original place after a lot of trouble and anxiety on the part of Mama bear and Thomas.  The story and the excellent art work by Stephanie Blanchart are well worth the reasonable price of the book.  This book is a keeper and also a good idea for Christmas gifts.

This is a story of Boomer, a lavender skunk who goes to school for the first time and is riduculed by Frankie the squirrel because of his color and odor.  He is defended by his friend, Roger the mouse, who says different isn't a bad thing, but Boomer's heart is broken and he runs off into the woods.  Roger tries to comfort him, but to no avail.  Then they hear screams coming from the school where a large bear is about to eat the school smart aleck. <br />Boomer warns the bear to let go of his classmate and when he doesn't, the little skunk lets him have it.  The bear runs off and Boomer's classmates cheer him and accept him.  The lesson is clear, don't judge someone by how they look.  This is a good book for children to read, particularly if they are \\"different.\\"  I particularly liked it because I had Samuel LePeuw, a pet mutant skunk who was almost a lavender color.  They act just like the book says and will turn their back on you, hit the ground with their front feet and spray you.  Luckily my Samuel was deodorized before I got him.	2005-06-25

Legalized marriage, or even common law marriage, gives a couple some automatic rights and privileges.  This is not true of unmarried couples and same sex partners.  If proper estate planning and power of attorney planning are missing from the relationship, then some distant, and sometimes unfriendly, relative might step in and ruin lives and property interests. <br />The book by Hoyt and Pollock, both experienced attorneys, is must reading for those not \\"legally married\\" and can guide the couple into disaster prevention steps.

For every previous Christmas the man and his wife had gone to the woods nearby and picked out the perfect Christmas tree.  They would then take the tree back to their home and decorate it, but the crowning glory of each tree would be when she placed the star on it.  He had lost his wife the previous spring and this was his first Christmas alone.  He had not gone to pick out a tree because he had lost heart after his loss. <br />At the same time a mare had become separated from her herd of wild horses and was wandering in the storm trying to find shelter.  She could hear wolves howling in the distance and she was frightened and alone.  She came to the old man's home and he heard her outside and took her into his barn, fed her and dried her off.  He drifted off to sleep in his barn that Christmas Eve, but when he awoke he found he had been given an unexpected gift.  I won't spoil things by giving you the ending, but it made my wife Sharon and me a little teary eyed.  This is an ideal Christmas present for anyone you know that cherishes the Christmas spirit as we do.  Keep a copy for yourself, but be sure and buy enough to give to those you love. <br />	2005-06-14

The little girl in the story is told that if she closes her eyes she will be able to call up her sleep pony, who will carry her off to a pleasant place in her dreams.  The art work is beautifully understated and portrays the little girl and Whinny, her pony, in pastel colored watercolors.  The story is good, the artwork is outstanding and her ponies reminded Sharon my wife and fellow radio network book reviewer of her Texas childhood.  I would recommend this book for any child, but particularly those children with night fears and troubled sleep.  There are no nightmares in this book, only friendly sleep ponies.	2005-06-07

Origins of Islam and a rather complete discussion of this religion then and now are valuable parts of this work by two editors who obviously have an extensive background to back up their work. <br />I liked the coverage of Islamic law and the description of the worship rituals and prayers.

All of the major Disney films are discussed in an objective fashion and in great detail. The relative lack of Christian observance by Walt Disney is balanced by his promotion of optimism and hard work, the need for faith in what you are doing and that evil is always punished and good is rewarded. According to Disney's movies, you don't pray to God, you wish upon a star instead. A lot of the personal life of Disney is covered, particularly his early years and I found the entire book to be well written and informative, but without the saccharin-sweet coverage that some authors might have put into their works about this remarkable man. I recommend this book highly for parents and students, particularly those in high school. Whether we like him or not, Disney is an integral part of American culture and, as one of my grandchildren recently said: 'Mickey Mouse rules!'	2004-12-11

This is an unusually thorough discussion of the fundamentals of weight loss by a physician who successfully used these 'Seven Pillars of Weight Control' himself, and who communicates his theories in a concise and readable way. This is not a specific diet, like the Mediterranean Diet, but a step by step how-to book. I recommend this book to anyone, particularly those with previously disappointing result, as a scholarly and believable 'diet book.' He includes his own story and his frustrations and disappointments. There are some before, during, and after photos. I enjoyed his recounting of his personal story and plan to give some away at Christmas to some of my larger relatives and friends. Buy it, you'll like it!  <br /> <br />	2004-09-09

Granger covers the five initial Harry Potter books and connects the story line and the characters to the messages found in the Christian bible.  We are all looking for stories that show the good people winning, and Harry Potter is a perfect example.  The work John Granger does in this book is scholarly and very much to the point as he points out connection after connection to the Good News.  His prose is neither dry nor boring.  It is often hard to put the <br />book down, which I cannot say for every book I have read.  We can see our own relationship to God as we read each of the Potter books and John Granger helped me with that insight.  I <br />recommend this book to any parent with children who are reading Rowlings' books.  Parents might have to explain some of the Christian connections to children, but often children wind up <br />explaining things to the parents.  An excellent read! <br />	2004-08-30

Thunderfoot is a baby elephant who is nurtured by his mother and grandmother, the latter being the matriarch of the herd. He soon learns that his grandmother makes sure the elephants are aware of danger and helps them find food and water. When his grandmother is shot by a poacher the herd runs to safety and he finds that all of them must adapt to losses and carry on. To quote the authors: 'Elephants, the largest land animals, are strong, intelligent, peaceful and fun-loving. The oldest female leads the herd, normally made up of daughters, granddaughters, sisters and their offspring. They all help to look after the youngest elephants. The males grow up within the herd, but leave to live on their own when they are about sixteen years old.' I have noticed that the most tireless workers in any group are the women. They are the ones who nurture, educate and guide the 'elephants' under their care. We males like to trumpet and make a lot of noise, but we do very little compared to our female counterparts. Buy a dozen of this wonderful book and give them to people you appreciate, who work, sometimes without credit given to them, for your comfort and welfare.	2004-07-01

As a book reviewer for Funseeker's Radio Network I read a lot of books for children.  This one helps with the process of saying goodbye to a treasured pet and getting used to another, sometimes more different, pet.  In this case Charlie has had a long and happy life as \\"the best cat in the world\\" for young Victor.  The boy is devastated when Charlie dies and doesn't think he will ever want another cat, but Charlie's vet, Dr. Levin calls him and offers him a new kitten.  He accepts reluctantly and soon finds that Shelley is a different cat altogether.  Her habits and ways are not like Charlie's, but he finally realizes that he again has the \\"best cat in the world.\\"  The story is well-written and the illustrations by Ronald Himler are excellent.  I would recommend this book highly to anyone who has lost a pet or as a gift for someone who is dealing with the death for a pet.	2004-06-16

I found myself taking notes on each piazza or building he described so that I could go back and experience them again.

Those he kills are the sort you run into in radio and television, particularly CBS and CNN. It starts slowly, and even though Bill is not George Guidall he keeps your interest up throughout the entire story. I found myself sitting outside my home listening to a particularly interesting part and unable to leave my car until a chapter was finished.

Billy Rose Marsh's story starts with a death many years after she meets the love of her life, Kenner Golden.  It is a nostalgic look at small town life in the South, but there are mysteries, secrets kept until near the end of the book and deaths, sometimes suspicious.  It is a hard book to put down and I found myself identifying with some of the characters, since I lived for a time in a similar Southern town.  Your feelings can range all the way from amusement to sadness.  There are a number of touching moments in the book, particularly notice when a dime is mentioned.  Buy the book, read it, then give several books to people you love.  As a book reviewer for The Funseekers Radio Network I read a lot of books every month.  This one really held my interest.  The combination of a 16 y.o. classical pianist who is influenced by Elvis, the air of mystery and the keeping of &quot;the secret&quot; in the book until the last part, plus the surprises at the end make the book a great read.	2004-02-16
