I was gonna to tell the story to try and emphacize the charm of this nasty little book, but now, thinking about it, I've decided the story is too dreadful.  Ah well.  Pat the Beastie is a great book though.  You get to pull the beastie's nasty boogers and smell the beastie's stinky booties and take a trip down the beastie's slimy stomach.  It's great fun, especially if you read it with a hoidy-toidy Brisish matron sort of accent.  It's funny and gross and children get eaten, beats getting to try on Mommy's ring or feel Daddy's scratchy face or have Thanksgiving in Houston by a mile.	2001-02-16

Man, I had no idea either till I picked up this book.  In fact, I had no idea that Jewish dietary laws made any distinctions at all on the locust front. (I mean, as far as I'm concerned, you could leave the locusts off the menu altogether and it's a fair bet I wouldn't even notice.)  Mary Douglas, extensively supported by a gaggle of other similarly academically endowed individuals in quote form, however, delves right into the whole locust conundrum and she does it in a truly fascinating manner.  What begins as a graceful though predictable swan dive assessment of profanity as disruption of cultural order jack knifes thrillingly there in the middle to talk about physical creatures as metaphoric representations of religious and cultural values.   The book starts out talking about dirt and ends up in a fascinating examination of how we as humans, both &quot;primative&quot; and &quot;civilized&quot;, twist our concrete world to become metaphor for psychological and spiritual experience  Cool, huh. Also, as an added treat, Douglas spends A LOT of time talking about the South American Lele cult of the pangolin.  (For laypeople, that's that funny armadillo/anteater thing that looks quite alot like a pinecone.)  Douglas takes some fairly weighty theories of cultural anthropology and turns them into an entertaining and infinitely readable piece.  A nice trick.  Oh, and did I mention the anteater?  What's not to love?	2000-09-27

If only some thoughtful relative had given me this instead of Pat the Bunny for my fourth birthday, I might not have been subject to the despotic reign of my neighbor, Keenan McCoy for so many years.  (Along with other things that are too horribly embarassing to mention, she used to pull down my mint green with white polka-dot polyester shorts and spank me bare-butted in full public view.  Talk about a kid who knew about ruling by fear.  Sheesh.) Anyways, for all you high school sophmores who were planning on weaseling out of reading The Prince and scanning the cliff notes an hour before class, this little number is a way better bet.  It meets the required standard of hitting all the relevant points, but in about a twentieth of the time.  Also, it is funny and has nifty Dick and Jane-esque illustrations resplendant in pink, yellow, and the same exact mint green of my aforementioned polyester shorts. All in all, it's a great little book that I am still kicking myself for not buying two years ago when I stumbled across it in a bookshop in Park Slope.  Alas.	2000-09-27

In a book on zoology you can read that bees build their cells in a certain way, their queen behaves in such and such a way, and so on.  The physical activity of the insect or animal is described, but if we presume that such behavior is meaningful for the bees, then we have projected something onto them.  We can only say that this is the way they appear to behave, and so far, we have no means of seeing how the thing looks from the point of view of the animal.  We do not know what kind of emotion the queen bee has when producing her eggs.  We can assume a great deal, but we cannot scientifically observe it.&quot;  One of the most fortunate and unfortunate experiences of this magical living of a human life is that in that this same phenomenon comes into play in our many and varied interactions with fellow members of our species.  It may seem to us in the realm of the physical that this or that person is reacting to this or that stimulus in this or that manner, usually based on our own personal experience with that particular stimulus.  We assume that the people around us, most particularly the people we love, are experiencing the situation we are experiencing in the same or a similar manner.  Not so, Oh friends.  I am continually taken aback by the astonishing fact that what I see is not what you see.  Usually this shock comes to me with all the pleasantness of those cups of ice-cold water my father used to toss over the shower curtain on me in the middle of my lengthy morning ablutions during my teen-age years.  Cynthia Rylant, thankfully, has a lighter touch.  With her characteristic grace, she reveals the fortunate aspect of disparate perceptions existing withing the same sphere.  (Ah la, You say tuh-may-ato, I say tuh-mah-to..) Reading this one always makes me feel like I'm sitting in a warm quiet spot of sun.  A fine job all 'round.	2000-09-25

First of all, don't you just love these Loeb editions.  In my opinion, they are the most aesthetically appealing collection of books ever.  Perfect size , nice shade of green, half in Greek so they make you look  real smart-everything you could ever ask for in the book-as-object  department.  So, that said, on to Lucian. Ever read Gulliver's Travels (I  know what you're thinking: &quot;She said she was gonna talk about  Lucian!&quot;  I am , I am, I promise) and wondered &quot;Where in bloody  blazes did he come up with all this philisophically abundant, politically  biting, incredible nonsense?&quot;  Well friends, look no further, Lucian  is the deposed king of philisophically abundant, politically biting,  incredible nonsense.  A True Story I and II is possibly the most  delightfully bizarre piece of literature that has ever passed before these  eyes, and I have a decided propensity for that sort of thing.  Lucian,  however, is not limited to that realm.  Every now and then he saunters away  from the race of men using their generative organs as mainmasts for sailing  excursions to give us his pity commentary on subjects as diverse as the  nature of slander and octegenarians, but wherever he goes, it's a brilliant  trip.  Though the parallel between Lucian and Swift definitely exists I  don't want to lead anyone astry by pushing it too much.  Swift's main  impetus was political commentary, wheras Lucian is a rhetoritician.  He  plays with a lighter touch,  so to speak.  You can almost see the wry smile  emerging cheshire-like from the page. Though Amazon lists Lucian as one  volume, beware, there are eight.  Don't panic though, the first one is such  a treat that you can either make a meal of it alone or flit gaily on to the  feast of the other seven.  Bon Apetite.	2000-06-30

(Our play, for which I  was the bitter disgruntled light person, was so bad that even to mention it  in the same paragraph with Christopher Durang is something of an insult.)   Anyway, I'd read Baby With the Bathwater and seen Laughing Wild and at 16 I  was convinced that they were the most brilliant, hysterical, heartbreaking  pieces of theater ever in the whole of human history. (When I was 18 I  stumbled upon Aristophanes and Euripides and THAT was all over, but hey,  not everyone can be Aristophanes or Euripides after all.) Anyways, Durang,  I mean, where else are you going to find Oedipal dreams about your father  inside your baked potato? The man IS a genius.  So, I was in Cambridge with  my Mom and I saw that Baby With the Bathwater was playing at a local  theater and convinced her that her life would remain eternally unfulfilled  unless she (we) went to go see it.  So off we went.  And oh boy did it go.   Like off the deep end.  Baby With the Bathwater is basically Phillip  Larkin's This Be The Verse (They &quot;mess&quot; you up your mum and dad.   They do not mean to, but they do.  They fill you with the faults they had  and add some extra just for you...)extended to play length with a generous  helping of the bizarre mixed in there.  i.e. NOT A GOOD PLAY TO SEE WITH  YOUR MOTHER, especially if your mother has a &quot;bad mom&quot; complex.   So, she thought I'd dragged her to this to make some sort of devious  comment on her parenting, while I was innocently and totally enthralled by  the bizarre notion of not checking the sex of your baby becaue you don't  want to invade it's privacy and the cool lighting. So, afterward she freaks  out and we have to have this long ole' mother/daughter talk where she had  to tell me how sucky a mom she thought she was and I hadto reassure her  that she didn't mess me up too bad and we ate clam chowder.  Though no one  got hit on the head with a tuna fihs can andwe never once talked about  Sally Jesse Rafael's glasses, it was a perfect example of life mirroring  art, or life mirroring Christopher Durang.  Take your pick.	2000-06-15

Whereas fiction, friendship, and Brooklyn are subjects in my life that I am  realitively comfortable and familiar with, I am only vaugely acquainted  with vacations and am completely in the dark on the porcupine thing.  So,  when I received Hugh Pine and Something Else for Christmas several years  ago, I was looking foreward to expanding my knowledge in these two rather  mysterious arenas.  There was, however, a slight problem.  The Something  Else in my copy of Hugh Pine and Something Else was the fact that in my  copy, the first signature was repeated over and over for the entire book.   A Calvino-like quest ensued.  I followed the trail of Hugh Pine to several  bookstores and libraries.  I riffled through shelves and placed orders. I  finally did found out out more about vacations and porcupines.  I have yet  to discover the Something Else that happened to Hugh Pine, but perhaps I  have, do to this most metaphysical children's book experience ever, touched  the hem of the Something Else that happened to me.	2000-06-14

Now, I owned this book as a child and though I must have read it something lik 30,000 times and I didn't learn one single dinosaur name.  I was fascinated however, by the weird watercolor pictures of the dinosaurs: the  way their heads looked so old, their ponderous feet, topogrphical knees,  and the fact that their jaws didn't seem to connect quite right with their  skulls.  They had funny bug eyes.  Oh, and there's this one picture where  they have this ghostly dinosaur in front of a white picket fence house with  Mom and Dad and Sally and Jeffy and little cocker spaniel in the yard.  You  can see all of them (house, family and dog) through the blue green shadow  of the dinosaur.  The dinosaur had it's head turned toward the reader with  a sort of imploring look on it's face.  The purpose, of course, was to show  the size, compared to you and your house, of whichever giant herbivore that  was.  The effect on me was slightly different though.  It gave me this  sense of extreme unease, like there were sad dead invisible giants  everywhere.  Maybe even that I WAS a sad dead invisible giant.  It was  weird.  Any, the only reason I remembered this cool but slightly disturbing  chidhood favorite was that not long ago, I was reading Denis Johnson's  novel about post-nuclear holocaustal Florida, Fiskadoro.  Scattered about  on what I take to be the Florida Keys are various groups of individuals  operating by seperate systems of organization; all weird combinations of  &quot;modern&quot; and &quot;primative&quot; cultures.  Anyway, there is  this loosely affilliated group of intellectuals that travel by boat to meet  together in this mouldering grade school covered in rubble and moss to try  and reassemble what they can of the knowledge of the lost world.  At one  point, everyone is fanatically excited because someone has found a book.   They all get together to read the book.  The book is All About Dinosaurs.

Thinking about God is, without a doubt and including  Thomas Pynchon and James Joyce, the densest book I have ever had the  combined pain and pleasure to read.  Solee is adamant.  She is thorough and  deft in her analysis of the relationship of concepts of God, culture,  religion, and identity.  Synaptic as a lab technician, she seperates these  fundamental concepts from one another and leaves them warm and pulsing in  your hads for you to put back together, or not, as the case, or more  particularly, as her case, may be.  This one is a bonafide mind-blower for  anyone who thought they had these things worked out.  A great book from a  great mind.	2000-06-08

Kozinski's tale of a young boy's wanderings through backwater Eastern Europe during WWII is a painstakingly beautiful foray into the intricacies of horror.  And I mean real horror.  I  thank the Gods above that no one has made a movie of this one.  If it were,  and I went, which I might not, I would probably have my eyes closed for  half of it.  The book is really about how low the human race can sink.  And  folks, it's pretty damn low.  There are no heroes and no excuses here.  The  technique of having the whole thing told, quite believably, from the point  of view of a child reinforces the growing sense throughout the book of the  futility, the self-perpetualting void, of violence.  I would touch on  scenes of note, but I had egg salad for lunch, and I'm feeling a little  queasy just thinking about it.  Actually, more than making me feel queasy,  reading it and thinking about The Painted Bird make me want to weep.

The book gives a vauge sense of the range of Ross's work,  including pieces from her Vietnam memorial, Allenown city parks, and public  schools projects.  The prints are well reproduced in tri or duotone but,  the organizatin is akward and doesn't flow well.  I think too, that in  tyingto produce a small afordable volume, there was much left out and the  piece as a whole suffers.  Personally, I'd rather spend a bit more money  for a more complete representtion of the work.  It' worth it.  Ross's  photos are intriguing. They capture something of the clumsy, well-meaning,  destructive, sad thing it is to be an American today.  I had Judith for a  photo class my third year of college and though I was perpetually late and  presented wet ill-washed prints, she put up wth me with an air of amused  and sardonic disgust that was almost parental.

I thought &quot;Woah, what's  that all about?.&quot;  Eventually, I got to meet her.  She was about  seventy-five, weighed maybe 100lbs, five feet tall, dresed in a pink hooded  sweatshirt and terrycloth sneakers, and just as sweet as you could imagine.   That's sort of the jist of this whole book right there: things are not  what they seem.  Swords Into Ploughshares is a history of the Ploughshares  movement- a nationwide faith-based affiliation of anti-nuclear and military  industrial complex activists committed to non-violent direct action.  Whew,  that's a mouthful.  What that means, very basically and slightly  melodramatically explained by me is: a group of people that holds hands and  prays together before sneaking into weapons facilities and disarming B-52's  with cordless drills and such.  Skillfully integrating elements of  political analysis and theology the book left me with some inkling at its  end of what was totally inconceivable to me at its beginning; namely, why  this sweet little old lady would jump into an ice cold river and pound on a  NUCLEAR SUBMARINE with a hand tool. (Other than the fact that she's insane  of course, and I've talked to her, and she's not; a fact that makes the  whole thing a bit harder to stomach, because if she's not crazy, and all  the other people in the book aren't crazy, then there's some incredible  motivation, passion, and dedication here that I have to deal with.

Not so friends.  He read the thing word for  word, as I discovered for myself when I stumbled upon it in the library a  few years back.  So, Rabbit is truly pathetic, Monkey utterly conniving,  Buzzard just as horrible as can be, and the whole thing freaky and  wonderful as Uncle Willie.	2000-05-16

I got it from the large Catholic family up the street for my eighth birthday and I still have it.  Lore is one of those fabuluous precocious kids that are the bane of their second grade  teachers.  She lives in a little German town called Dinkelsbuhl which is  lovely and full of decent folk.  Lore has a father who is slightly gruff  and overprotective and a cat named Hans.  (She also, aparantly, has a  sewing basket, but she doesn't seem the sort of girl to use it.)  So,  that's Lore.  The other major player here is The Captain, not named, who  goes around burning a pillaging lovely little German villages.  Inevitably,  these two meet up and the result is one of my favoritest endings ever.  It  also features gingerbread (I have a personal thing for food in childrens'  books) and great pictures by Tomie DePaola.  A winner.	2000-05-16

I thought &quot;Woah, what's  that all about?.&quot;  Eventually, I got to meet her.  She was about  seventy-five, weighed maybe 100lbs, five feet tall, dresed in a pink hooded  sweatshirt and terrycloth sneakers, and just as sweet as you could imagine.   That's sort of the jist of this whole book right there: things are not  what they seem.  Swords Into Ploughshares is a history of the Ploughshares  movement- a nationwide faith-based affiliation of anti-nuclear and military  industrial complex activists committed to non-violent direct action.  Whew,  that's a mouthful.  What that means, very basically and slightly  melodramatically explained by me is: a group of people that holds hands and  prays together before sneaking into weapons facilities and disarming B-52's  with cordless drills and such.  Skillfully integrating elements of  political analysis and theology the book left me with some inkling at its  end of what was totally inconceivable to me at its beginning; namely, why  this sweet little old lady would jump into an ice cold river and pound on a  NUCLEAR SUBMARINE with a hand tool. (Other than the fact that she's insane  of course, and I've talked to her, and she's not; a fact that makes the  whole thing a bit harder to stomach, because if she's not crazy, and all  the other people in the book aren't crazy, then there's some incredible  motivation, passion, and dedication here that I have to deal with. Somehow.  Cool. Yikes.)	2000-05-16

First of all, I just gotta say &quot;Don't you love those Czechs?&quot;  I mean what other country would have a poet/playwrite/activist/ex-con president?  Sorta makes me want to emigrate.  Anyway, Havel's volume of  letters to his wife, Olga, from prison in the late seventies is quietly  revealing.  I am used to his electric political comentaries and dark  absurdist theater and this hollow correspondence came as a shock.  Perhaps,  most of all it was the shallow loveless relationship between he and Olga  that surprised me.  In my mind Havel is a passionate larger-than-life  figure.  I wanted, and expected, to discover a living and organic  relationship in these pages and was utterly disapointed in that respect.   What we see, and aparantly what they have (had? I dunno) is very dry,  businesslike, and unmoving.  I wonder if expending so much energy in the  public and artistic sphere leaves little or nothing for private  relationships.  Perhaps that's what's going on, perhaps it is more complex  or subtle.  Whatever the reasons, the book was interesting as well as  dissapointing in that it revealed a totally new and unexpected side of  Havel.  This book humanized him.  As well as the troubled, or maybe just  bizarre marraige,  I got to hear him struggle with his daily frustrations  and desires-food, health, writing, keeping himself educated and interested  in life.  There IS a good bit of of political writing in the letters, (it's  pretty obvious that most of them were not just for Olga)including some  detailed descriptions of the resistance movement, that are really as fine  as any of his other writings.  I could put it down to the dustjacket, but  the whole had to me this sad tan feeling; heavy, still-like empty dusty  rooms at that time of day where the light is all saturated.  Well written  and translated, all in all an interesting read.	2000-05-10

Already Dead is a haunting and horrible journey where the sickening downward spiral of Nelson Fairchild's inner life is mirrored in his northern California  community.  Maybe it's more than that, maybe it's even that somehow  Fairchild, through his possibly demonic counterpart Carl Van Ness, is at  the center of this spiritual gyre that engulfs the whole coast.  I don't  think it's a coincidence that Van Ness's attempted suicide, which acts as a  catalyst for all the later action in the book, is a drowning. The whole  thing is like being pulled slowly but steadliy from beneath in a deep pool  of your own cerebral juices; you can feel yourself pulling more and more of  that sour liquid into your lungs as you read. So, while that might not  sound like much of a reccommendation, I think any book that can make you  feel that way, must be  a great book.  The aforementioned experience while  not necessarily plesant, is not bereft of a certain ammount of humor or  bemeusment as might be expected with your life flashing before your eyes;  life is, after all, funny stuff.  There's no denying that Already Dead is  dark, that it's hard, that it does make you feel sort of dead, but it also  sharpens the senses and gives a thread of clarity about what is eternal and  vital; it helps you see what makes life worth the living.  It does that in  a very twisted way of course, but really, this is Denis Johnson, what else  did we expect.	2000-05-10

Or rather, you can give an Athenian wings but he won't become a gentle agrarian bird rather, he'll rouse the citizenship,  attack the Gods, and turn on you at the last possible moment.  While some literary critics tout this as Aristophanes' most unfathomable work, well, I just think they're  being silly.  Maybe that's my own lack of education speaking, but I think  The Birds a pretty obvious, as well as bitingly funny, commentary on  humans, or men, or Athenians (all of these concepts probably being more or  less the same to Aristophanes)as hopelessly political and power-hungry  beings.  One thing I love about this, and, I suppose, all of the Greek  dramas, is that they are ultimately very malleable and applicable to my  (our?) modern experience. (With a certain ammount of difficulty) you can  lead a 21st Century North American to social conciousness but they're still  gonna want and have the economic buying power to get, cheap Nikes.   Cynical?  Yes.  Scathing? Yes. Real? You betcha.  Sure we've got indoor  plumbing, but our cultural context is back in the golden age.  Lucky we've  still got dudes like Aristophanes to give us a clue as to how to slog  through it all.	2000-05-09

The  characters are fascinating and utterly believable, even in their complete  eccentricity-I swear I had some of those teachers in high school.

I really really like Peter Carey; not only does the boy know how to write, he's kinda cute.  I suppose that has no real bearing one way or the other though.  Anyway, Jack Maggs tells  the story of escaped convict Jack Maggs's search for, well, on the surface  vengence and his son, but ultimately, his identity in Victorian England.   The dust jacket, as well as being pretty cool looking, said that it was  supposed to be written in the world or with the feel of Dickens.  That was  the first problem. I had just finished reading Pickwick and Tale of Two  Cities and, Carey may be good, but certainly, no one writes Dickens like  Dickens. He rocks. So, reading Dickins having been the first problem, the  second problem was that I had also recently read Peter Carey; Oscar and  Lucinda to be exact.  Folks there is just no comparison.  Oscar and Lucinda  is beautiful.  It's tragic, it's moving, it's lovely, it's funny, it's  sensual, it's utterly heartbreaking.  Jack Maggs, well, it just isn't.  Though the story is intriguing and there were some nice moments, the  miscarraige and the bit in the boat being foremost, the rest was rather  dry; especially coming to it with Dickens and Oscar and Lucinda in my head.   So, though it's not a waste of time to read or anything, you might want to  grab Little Dorrit and Oscar and Lucinda instead.	2000-05-05

This great, though moderately sized, collection of the work of American artist Edward Hopper  focuses on the most well-known of his paintings and etchings.  The Automat,  New York Movie, Drugstore, Night Wind, and, of course, the ever-present  Nighthawks are all there.  And even though I've looked at these paintings,  or reproductions of them, hundreds of times, they never loose their  intensity for me.  They lead me constantly back to revelation; of my self,  of my culture, of my country.  There is something about the sarkness, the  isolation, and the grandeur of Hopper's work that is completely moving and,  I would say, completely American. (Unfortunately a 1000 word book review  isn't the place to go into that.  You'll just have to trust me.)  Of added  interest in this particular book of Hopper's work is a meaty biography,  timeline,  and criticism of his work. So, a nice overview of Hopper's life  and art that's perhaps just as satisfying but WAY WAY cheaper than the BIG  Hopper book.	2000-04-28

Here we have a rare treat; a dynamic duo, a tremendous twosome.  Eugene Achet, who some call the father of modern photography and who is arguably the greatest photographer of all time is teamed up with John Sarkowski, certainly one of the greatest  curators, editors, and writers about photography of all time.  This 3  volume set is absolutely stunning.  It's at the very least a must see, if  not a must buy, for anyone who is seriously interested in photography.  I  had a photo prof. who said this book was more important than the Bible for  an artist.  I'm not exactly sure wether this is a more profound statement  about the spiritual state of artists or the importance of this book, but it  was cool either way.  The works in this particular volume are mostly urban  landscape/architecture.  To the modern eye they may seem slightly banal,  but we have to keep in mind here that the reason they seem slightly common  is that Achet is the source.  Anything that looks even vaugely like this  work came from Achet.  There are very few of these later works, however,  that are done with such mastry of light and composition as is constant in  Achet's work .  That man, more than just about anyone else, knew how to  have his head in the right place at the right time.  The whole collection  is exquisitely selected arranged by John Sarkowski.  This volume, this  whole set in fact, is a true treasure.	2000-04-27

He's the son of horrendously famous John, but has a writing style that is all his own.  His work is thoughful without being pensive.  He tends to focus on everyday objects-using them as landmarks in the  mapping of his mind's wanderings.  Though A Midnight Journey is a  children's book, it has that same sense about it. The story is of a little  boy (sadly, I can't remember his name it's either Herman or Hector) who, on  the day of the big snow goes down to the village to get a haircut.  He  takes his dog, Sophocles, and looses the dog along the way.  The boy waits  all day and eventually goes to bed without Sophocles reappearing.  He lays  in bed in the dark listening to the dim clinks and muffled laughter of his  parents giving a small dinner party.  Then, he gets up, stands in the light  of his window, puts on his boots and clothes over his pyjamas and slips out  into the silvery-snowy world to look for his dog.  It's a quietly magical  little book with watercolor illustrations which really capture the feel of  the story.	2000-04-27

Tesserae is a collection of short prose works by renound poet/activist Denise Levertov.  Usually, I find the recorded childhood/family memories of someone else either to personal to them to be really relevant to me or to sticky-sweet with nostalgia to be palatable in a long-term sense.  Tesserae  navigates these obstacles with admirable poise.  Rather than creating a  picture of her family for me to glance at cusorily, Levertov creates a  landscape in which I can wander and linger at my leisure.  The short  narratives are full of mystery, wonder, and a quiet humor that is all  Levertov.  The pieces about her Father's conversion from Orthodox Judiasm  to Christianity and his subsequent expulsion from the family, her mother  and the pillows, and the whole family's beach holiday stick especially in  my mind.  I remember just how the Russian winter wind felt when her father  found the scrap of paper with the gospel of John on it by the river, the  texture of those pillows when hugged to the chest, and exactly what it is  to be a girl entering puberty struggling with your own burgeoning body and  intellect on the blinding sand during a family vacation.  Individually, the  pieces are magical bits of prose that display the experiences of the  different family members like tiny finely-crafted curio boxes, as a  collection they speak about history and identity.  They engage the reader  in an emotional dialog about where &quot;self&quot; comes from, and how it  goes from there. Though I like her poetry, I think this is Levertov's best  work.	2000-04-25

At four pages, eleven paragraphs (not incuding the introductory quote), thirty five sentences, and (sorry Georges) more words than I really wanted to count despite how cool it would have looked here, Ellis Island is a tome.  It made me more intensely examine my own identity than all three  hundred pages of What Color is Your Parachute even came close to doing.  (Actually, I only read about four pages of that one too, but I could tell  where it was going.) Ellis Island, however, was a complete surprise.  The  bit about what it means to be a Jew and the fact that that aspect of his  identity is more concretely definied by its abscence than its presence, is  profound.  I mean, other people have said it, certainly, but this is,  without a doubt, the clearest presentation I have encountered.  I think  it's particularly telling that he should set these musings in America, at  Ellis Island.  We, as Americans, particularly as white Americans, have a  watered down and dissapated culture defined not by who we are, what we  love, how we live etc., but what, ultimately, we are not.  This small work  was a four-page invitation to examine my relation to my roots, my country,  and my culture.  Ugh.  I loved it.	2000-04-24

I'm going on faith here and assuming that the occassionally dippy rhyme scheme that pops up in some of the poems is a tragic result of the aforementioned difficulty.  For the most part the work is lovely. (I mean what would you expect from possibly  the greatest French poet ever?)  Dark and troubled, you get a vauge sense  of ominous hulking black shapes around you, with the occassional glorious  bright spotof hope, the sensation of reading the work mirrors the nocturnal  landscape in which many of the poems are set.  It's sort of an interesting  collection.  It skips over several of Verlaine's better known works  choosing, rather, to give sort of a life overview in 61 pages.  The  translator, along with going on and on about indeed how hard it is to  translate Verlaine also talks a bit about his intentions in the selection.   And, really, if you have some small knowledge of Verlaine's life, it does  make the book more interesting.  You can see the philosophical progression  of Verlaine's life and follow the subtle sine waves of his unique despair.  Claire de Lune, Grotesques, and Parables are some of my personal favs.	2000-04-24

On those days when getting out of bed is a psychological problem, I take one cup of earl grey with milk and a shot of Gerard Manley Hopkins.  Something about the way he puts his words together makes me walk out of the  house seeing in a totally diferent way.  Hopkins struggles with what it is  to be faithful, with what it is to live in creation in a way which honors  God, with what, finally, it is to be human.  I'm particularly fond of this  volume, just because it contains all my favorite of his poems.  I've tried  a couple of other collections of his work, but I find that I just flip  through them until I come to the stuff that I like from this one, so what's  the point.  Carrion Comfort, The Windhover, and God's Grandeur are  incredible pieces of work.  I've read them, literally, hundreds of times  and they have not lost their ability to challenge me.  That, in my  experience, is a rare thing; something that helps me get out of bed in the  morning.	2000-04-21

Also, there's one in there about the  stubborn stupidity of old folks that is absolutely delightful and hilarious  though the title escapes me at the moment.

Weil's writing can be extremely dense, I occassionally had to read sentences three or four times to understand what was going on.  The problem is not really that her  sentences are complicated, but rather that the ideas she is putting forth  are, at times, heinously difficult to grasp.  When you do finally get it  though, Wow!  I could alomost feel the wrinkles in my cerebellum changing  course.  Her analysis of human &quot;rights&quot;, her thoughts &quot;on  personality&quot;, and her assessment of the spiritual aspects of the human  soul are astounding.  She has an uncanny ability to dismantle social power  matrixes, lay them at your feet, and challenge you to re-evaluate your own  interaction with them.  As a fan of Greek literature I also recommend the  essay &quot;The Iliad, a Poem of Force&quot; as one of the more lucid  deconstructions of that work.  This is a fine anthology which, due to it's  chronological orginization and well-written introduction, also give  fascinating insight into the growth and development of thought processes of  a truly remarkable woman.  All in all, this anthology is just extremely  cool, though difficult to plow through, it is worth every moment.	2000-04-19

I like Pierce and she has a knack for turning a tale, but this one just  wasn't as tight as I might have liked.  The pictures, however, were  wonderful- I especially liked the snow dogs.  They held the book where the  story slacked off.  A nice piece-especially on a cold night in front of a  warm fire with your hunk of journey cake.	2000-04-19

The Insect God is dark  dark dark, sick sick sick, and really fabuluous.  Poor little Millicent  Frastly dissappears into the oncoming dark without a trace.  Oh pity the  poor child with a weakness for cinnamon balls.  Even the most ardent  child-hater, which popular myth held Gorey to be, can not help but give a  little shudder at the gristly fate of disgustingly sweet and beribboned  Millicent.  Wonderfully illustrated in Gorey's ominous stlye, the Insect  God is a shadowy romp through the mind of one of Earth's strangest  humorists.  If you find you love the book, you might want to check out the  song of the same text and title covered in an apropriately creepy manner by  the Monks of Doom.	2000-04-18

As I consumate Calvino fan, I have to  say I was completely dissapointed by the title essay the editors are raving  about here; the one about Calvino's old-school agragarian father trying to  spark cinema-going Calvino's interest in hauling veggies.  The same story  is told under the guise of fiction in Difficult Loves under the title of  Lazy Sons, and, in my opinion, it was ten times better.  I never thought  I'd say it, but I was bored.  Bored reading Calvino?  Can you imagine?   Neither could I.  The other four essays were delightful and charming.   (Personally I was rather fond of the one about the trash.)  The  writing/memory excercizes reminded me of work that Calvino's long-time  friend George Perec put forth in Species of Spaces.  They made me think, or  rethink, or be intentional about thinking about, memory and space and  existence.  That's the sort of thing I want and expect from Calvino.  Maybe  I'm just sulking about that first essay, but I wanted something better,  something more like the other essays there.  Maybe, since this book was a  compilation of Calvino's unpublished work that was printed posthumasly it  was merely and editing mistake that allowed such disparate pieces to appear  together.  Maybe I would have liked that title essay better on it's own.  I  dunno.  While I certainly wouldn't say don't read The Road to San Giovanni,  I might caution Calvino fans to let go of some of their expectations before  delving in.	2000-04-18

After reading the Loeb translation of the Homeric Hymns and Homerica, I was inclined to look askance on this slim little volume by Thelma Sargent.  Upon opening the cover, however, I found I had been mistaken.  Not only are  these verse translations of short invocations and hymns to the Greek Gods  and Godesses lovely and effecting (to which I will give credit where credit  is due to Homer,an unlikely but romantic notion,or whichever ancient bard  had the presence of mind to create them), they manage to be quite readable  as well (credit for which I am willing to divide up between said bard and  Thelma Sargent).  The hymns are very straightforeward, utilizing in  conjunction with the familiar stories of the Gods and Godesses, imagery  common to the times and people for which they were written.  Taking this  alone into consideration, their beauty is impressive; rather like poetry  invoking a Goddess to be present in your daily coffee making and data  processing. Then again, maybe not, to have survived two and a half  centuries, they would have to be pretty good little poems. I found the  Hymns to Demeter, Delian Apollo, and  the Mother of the Gods particularly  elegant.  It is from some of these hymns that we get our primary source  material for some of our knowledge of Greek mythology.  It is interesting  to me, who was weaned on English re-tellings of these same myths, to read  them in, at least closer to, their origional form.  They are much deeper,  the language much more sweeeping, than I had ever imagined- like the Psalms  or Song of Solomon.  We don't often think of those well-worn myths as  religious tales.  The way (I guess I mean the words and rythms)in which  they were written, and then translated in this edition, makes the fact that  they are religious texts decidedly apparant.  It was, if not mind-blowing,  than at least mind-stretching and intriguing to have them presented in this  way.	2000-04-18
US	49808161	RG012WUX364BY	0899194001	570125960	King of the Cats	Books	4	6	6	N	N	prowlin and yowlin on the bayou	Those luminous yellow eyes watching me, that's what I remember most clearly about this fascinating dark little tale.  I checked out The King of the Cats from the public library when I was eight years old and staying  with my grandmother.  I've never forgotten it. An old man walking home  through the louisiana bayou night sees a ghostly funeral procession of cats  comes home to his tarpaper shack and tells his old wife about it.  Watch  their big tomcat's eyes as he tells the story.  In these days of the  blatant scary fiction of R.L Stine and Goosebumps The King of the Cats is  subtle, beautiful, and foreboding in a sort of mesmerizing way that is  truly uncommon in children's literature. I don't know if it is, but is has  the feel of an old oral folk tale, worn smooth to its most basic elements  by years of telling.  At eight, I loved it, at twenty four, I still love  it.	2000-04-17

O.K., the title-fascinating the story-interesting, but could have better written, I think.  The pictures-five stars, awesome pictures.  They're like Magritte meets that pair of jams I had in the fifth grade. Incredible.   They totally remind me of dreaming as a child-gorrilas in the trees in the  park, lizards under my bed, kites that turn into parrots. Also, I'm   inordinately fond of food references in children's books, so the bit about  oatmeal with honey and milk is a big part of the book's appeal to me.  The  story is basically an imaginary friend book, but with a charming colorful  twist.	2000-04-17
US	49808161	R3N21W6NFLNII3	0671272217	644175480	The Fratricides	Books	4	19	20	N	N	only one pot of basil in the whole village	Perhaps the least well known of Kazantzakis' bleak beautiful epics, The Fratracides is as in-depth examination of the effects of oppression as I have discovered.  The book is set in a mountain village in Greece during  the Turkish occupation.  While on the surface it is about a revolutionary  faction and it's resistance to the occupation and the villager's  resistance, and occasionally support, of that faction, the book also  operates on several, more intriguing levels. It examines the different  human responses to domination as clearly as any sociology book, but with  characters, words, and images that worm their way around your head in a way  no textbook ever could.  The fatalism of the of the literally hungry  violence-sick villagers, the power-hungry priest grabbing at straws, the  zeal of the revolutionary leader, the sensual despair of the town  Magdalene; the characters manage to function symbols of human reactions as  well as fully dimensional people. Kazantzakis is the master of the life of  the world vs. the life of faith dilemna and that dynamic most certainly  plays out in this work, though in a different way than in most of his other  writings.  It is not just one person struggling with the meaning of faith,  but a whole community embodying the various aspects of that particular  drama.  The Fratracides is, I would say, the hardest of Kazantzakis'  fictional writings in the sense that he gives the reader very little to  hope for.  But, when you stop to think about it, how appropriate.   Occupation and violence are not necessarily situations in which hope is a  facile option.  The writing is solid; Kazantzakis has the profound ability  to distill human experience emotion into dense stones that pave the  villages and hills where the action takes place.  The Fratricides is unique  in it's ability to be spiritual without being dogmatic, analytical without  being dry, and thouroughly beautiful both in story and writing.	2000-04-17
US	49808161	R1BD8HHJQCJFJD	0394753585	609202658	All Fires the Fire	Books	4	17	19	N	N	innner space	Like a soft bag bag full of marbles; each piece in this well-crafted collection of short fiction is tight, translucent, and colorful as a glass ball.  Cortezar's short fiction is better focused than his longer work,  specifically Hopscotch which I found slightly gimmiky and annoying.  This  work, however manages to be incredibly solid and satisfying without being  shallow or facile (a difficult task).  Cortezar's style here is reminiscent  of some of the short fiction of Italo Calvino encapsulating that same sense  of crushingly beautiful tragi-comedy that leaves you wondering wether  you're awake or asleep.  The stories range in subject from a family trying  to protect an aging mother from the death of her son by keeping up a false  correspondence for years to a man who falls in love during a three-month  traffic jam just outside of Paris.  Cortezar explores the same old stuff in  the stories: the complexity of human relationships, the bizarre quirks of  tenderness, everyone's ultimate solitude.  The thing is: he does it in a  way that makes me examine &quot;the same old stuff&quot; in a new way; like  looking into the tiny bubbles in the glass of that marble. Really, he says  in words something that cannot be said in words.  If that makes any sense.   The work is funny and lovely and surprising and, on the whole, one of the  finest collections of short fiction I have found.	2000-04-14
US	49808161	R2DKH6Z8VQBGDA	0517566818	704971218	Out of This World: An Anthology of the St. Mark's Poetry Project 1966-1991	Books	5	3	3	N	N	Out of Print?  Out of my Mind!	To Whom It May Concern: Buy this book!  Or borrow it your literary neighbor, or steal it from the library; anything, just get you hands on it.  Out of This World is a comprehensive lexicon of of the life of the  infamous St. Mark's in the Bowery Poetry Project.  From Ginsberg to  Ashberry, from O'Hara to St. Francis, from the down and dirty free verse of  Paul Beatty and Jim Carroll to the the luminous prose of Mary Montenegro,  this book is finger lickin' good.  While it is dissappointing at times not  to have more that one or two pieces by each poet, it gives you a scope that  few works do.  Elegantly edited and sequenced by Anne Waldman, the  project's long-time director, Out of This World is a five-pound gem worth  dodging library security or the wait for an out of print copy.  Dig it.	2000-04-13

While 100 Years of Solitude condenses the history of a  continent into one town, Love in the Time of Cholera, takes all human  experience of Love and distills it down to these two people.  100 Years of  Solitude is all about separation while, finally Love in the Time of Cholera  chooses to grasp at the possibility of these two people coming together in  tenderness despite time and history and everything in the universe that  would seperate one human from another.  There is hope here.  It is tiny and  old far far past it's time, but, miracle of miracles, it exists. In this  world there is very little that gives us a real sense that it will be ok.   Personally, any sense I have of this, was born reading this book.	2000-03-27
