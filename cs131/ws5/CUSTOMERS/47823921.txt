Until the end of this wonderful story, I didn't realize that it was a fiction about a \\"real character\\"...and what a wonderful \\"character\\" Mabel Stark is!<br />The life of Mabel Stark, and all of her alias' was so much fun, and pain.  The history of the carnivals and circus with all of it's eccentricities was so interesting.  The character's were wonderful, and seeing everything through the eyes of this wonderful woman was...enlightening.  She had such a great take on her life, and the way lifes ups and downs influence the journey.  Her journey was heartbreaking at times, joyful at other times, but always interesting and exciting.  I just loved her!<br />Read and enjoy!<br />Debbi  :)	2003-03-28

The cast of characters is phenominal, each soul distinct and fully realized, as well as lovable; I really cared for all the souls in each of the two main characters &quot;houses&quot;.<br />The story kept me going, with enough twists and turns to make it interesting, even exciting as I got to the last pages of the book to see how everyone made it through.<br />The writing was wonderful, I laughed, and cried, and was completely drawn into Andrew and Penny's head, (and heart).<br />I loved it, totally enjoyable!<br />Enjoy,  Debbi  :)	2003-03-12

Maybe it is because I am from Revere, maybe it is because I am an Italian American, maybe it is because I am a sensitive woman, surely it is because Roland Merullo is an exceptional writer!<br />I felt like I was reading my history, and the history of my family as I was reading this story.  The characters are all people I grew up with, the same insecurities, the same hopes and dreams, the same tragedies, and Mr. Merullo captured the heart and soul of life in a small town in America perfectly!<br />I absolutely love this story, these characters and I am so Proud that I am a Revere person.<br />I beg you to read this story and not laugh out loud and cry with your soul!<br />I don't know how to thank Mr. Merullo enough for his insight, his humor; his soul must know my soul and I am forever in his debt.<br />Enjoy,<br />Debbi  :)	2003-01-07

This book dealt with a subject matter that has always fascinated me, that of Near-death experiences; with characters I really enjoyed and cared about, in a place that I know very well, being from the area, and also educated me on art and religion from centuries past.  As well as all this, the story was a thrilling page-turner, that I literally could not put down.<br />My heart beat faster and my pulse was racing as I read.  I liked the way Ms. Schilling tied up all her loose ends and made  everything fit.  I reccomend this book highly.<br />Enjoy!<br />Debbi  :)	2002-10-30

The characters were engaging, the settings and descriptions were on the money, the plot, thought not overwhelming, was interesting enough to keep you turning the pages.<br />I enjoyed the way Ms. Quindlen wrote, and the insights to a &quot;dad's&quot; perspective on raising an infant.

The characters are marvelous!  They evoked such emotion from me, hate, contempt, love, sorrow, wishful thinking (?).  Sugar for all her hard core life and attitudes in the beginning of the novel is a hero for the working girl, no matter what field she is in.  The glimpses into Agnes's madness were remarkable, making you want to shout at her one minute, and hold her in your arms the next.  William...I just wanted to...never mind, suffice it to say, I was prepared to like him, but his arrogance, selfishness, and \\"stupidity\\" got in the way  :)<br />Even the minor characters were so three dimentional.  Emmaline Fox, her father Doctor Curlew, the other prostitutes and madame's, the pages just kept turning and turning to see what was going to happen to who next.<br />The descriptions of the Victorian times, places, thinking, and events was so great I felt that I was transported back to that time, and it took a second to come back to the 21'st century when I reluctantly had to put the book down!<br />We've come a long way from then ladies, and Thank-God for that!<br />I can't reccomend this book enough...<br />Read and Enjoy!<br />Debbi	2002-09-23

My mother told me about this book some time ago, and for some reason I never got around to it...I am so glad that I was finally smart enough to pick it up.  Sacajawea, her life, her friendships, her loves, her families among many indian and white tribes was amazing.  Her adventures almost unbelievable, and it makes me so proud to be not only a woman, but one of native american descent.<br />All of the characters were multi-dimentional and wonderful people to read about, and sympathise with.  All of the Indian beliefs and customs were so interesting, and some were so beautiful that you &quot;believed&quot;.<br />I would reccomend this book to everyone, for it has something FOR everyone...adventure, comedy, tragedy, love, loss, life.<br />Enjoy,  Debbi  :)	2002-05-21

Will's wife Virginia, who believed in, supported, and was so frightened for him; his mother-in-law, who was on his side from the beginning to the end, helping the other men's families while they were confined in prison; and his sister, beautiful, strong, and unafraid to go to the ends of the earth to prove her brother's innocence.  Will's attorney, Atwell, again, a man who went the extra mile, even when he wasn't all that sure of his client's innocence.<br />The part about the miners fighting for a union broke my heart, the struggles that they had to go through, the awful working conditions they had to endure...and there was Will, just trying to make a difference, trying to help the families, literally trying to save their lives by &quot;uniting&quot;.  He was a wonderful man by all accounts, strong in his beliefs, and fearless in the face of adversity.<br />The story of his parents, and grandparents was so enjoyable, with all the love and adventure of people trying to escape their countries and start anew in &quot;The land of the Free, and the home of the Brave.&quot;<br />America is a land of so many different peoples who came here on the soul belief that they would be treated with fairness, equality, and respect.  I am always so saddened when I read these true accounts of how we treat other cultures and nationalities because of fear, or mis-understanding.  The only true Americans, are Native Americans, everyone else can trace their ancestry all the way back to some relation, who was brave enough to come to this country in order to seek the American Dream...Is it just a Dream?  I hope not.<br />Will believed in the Dream; he believed in equality for all, for fair wages for working men and women; he believed in the union, he believed in Free speech...he believed that he was an American.  And he was!<br />Enjoy, Debbie believed in Free speech...he believed that he was an American.  And he was!<br />Enjoy, Debbi	2002-04-11

I would have liked a more in depth look at Artemisia and her husband, their relationship, and his relationship with his daughter.<br />Although this was not an &quot;exciting Page-turner&quot;, it did hold my attention, and I cared about the people in the story.  I really enjoyed the descriptions and the interpretations of Artemisia's paintings, Italy, and the art of the times, and I found myself looking up her paintings on line so that I could see for myself what she wanted so badly to express in her art.<br />I am very glad that I read this story, and look forward to reading her other book, Girl in Hayicinth Blue, as I haven't yet had the pleasure.<br />Enjoy,<br />Debbi	2002-03-21

Like all the other reviewers I found that I could not put this book away, the characters kept calling me back.  Queen Michal's voice resonated in my mind and my heart.  I found this to be a fascinating story of Biblical proportions and I am also eagerly awaiting another from Ms. Edghill.<br />Everything was here, love, hate, romance, intrigue, written so well the pages practically turned themsevles.<br />If you liked The Red Tent, this is a must read.  Even if you don't normally like biblical fiction, this is a story for all genres.<br />Enjoy,<br />Debbi	2002-03-21

Rich in character; you love and hate and understand all the major characters of this story.  I was torn in my feelings for Clergue, while I wanted to hate him for what he did, (or better yet, what he didn't do), I always ended up feeling sorry for him.  Fabrisse was the character I rooted for most of the story; I really wanted her to find some happiness, for I felt that she deserved it more than anyone else, and I thought that she would find it in Grazida, who I loved.  Unfortunately she never did.  Grazida, (Echo), brought beauty to the story, her sense of goodness in God, the earth, and all things wonderful brought everything into focus.  How can you love God, and not love the world he made for you, how can you forego all the gifts provided for you in this world in the name of God?  This story asks some tough questions about faith and what I was brought up to believe, there is a fine line between the Good Faith and The Good Men.<br />Read it and Enjoy,<br />Debbi	2002-03-05

I really loved the character of Picture Maker, and all of the people she came in contact with on her long journey to Greenland.  The story kept going from one adventure to the next, from heartache to triumph and back again.  The customs of all the native americans were fascinating, their beliefs, their values, their way of life, I especially liked learning about the Inuit.<br />...Just a small note...<br />The fable about the beginning of the the world at the beginning of the book was a favorite of my daghter's and she has asked me to tell her the story of Sky Woman every night.  How simple and easy life can be when you believe in the magic of the world around you.<br />Read this story, it is truly wonderful.<br />Enjoy, Debbi	2002-02-27

The story of Anna Frith, her family and town, her friends and foes, her strengths and weaknesses, faith, sickness, love, etc., kept me reading until the end.  I never knew the &quot;real&quot; story of this town in England so if there are historical &quot;inconsistancies&quot;, I didn't really mind, the overall story, from Anna's point of view, was enough.  There was a continuing theme throughout this book, about having and keeping faith in what you committed to do, about friendship, overcoming some of the greatest odds people have to face, and &quot;going on&quot; to live the best life you can find.  I loved the characters, especially Anna and the Reverand's wife, Elinor; and let's not forget the &quot;witches&quot;!  All in all this was an extremely enjoyable read, and I highly reccomend it.<br />Debbi	2002-02-06

The concept of this novel intrigued me, I love different cultures and stories about the people and their myths and legends, so I was excited to start this book, I was in no way prepared to get so involved, so fast, (from the first page), with the characters and the overall story of the Japanese invasion of the Phillipines during WW II.  It is amazing to me what strength the human spirit has to endure so much hardship and heartache.<br />The basic story is told from three different points of view; that of Alejandro, the oldest brother of a family hiding in their basement during the Japanese occupation, with neighbors and friends, Isabelle, the oldest daughter, and Domingo Matapang, a guerilla fighter trying to save his country and family.  Intermingled are stories from some of the most wonderfully entertaining group of people sharing the cellar with Alejandro and Isabelle's family.<br />What these main characters had to go through will tear your heart out; some of the stories will gladden you and make you smile, all will tug at your heart strings.<br />I couldn't put this book down!  I was totally involved with what was happening in the Phillipines, what was happening to the characters, how they were going to come through such horrendous conditions and treatment, and through it all the history and legends of the people of the Phillipines was amazing.  What a wonderful tribute to the strength and heart of an amazing culture.<br />I can't reccomend this book strong enough, I loved it!!!<br />Enjoy,  Debbi	2002-01-22

A young (?) southern belle, and a General 22 years her senior, get married after knowing eachother for three days, and he whisks her off to the western frontier, so he can try to keep order in the Indian lands.<br />  The injustices that were done to the indians are just one aspect of the things you learn, along with some history of the west; but it's the characters and their story that keep you turning the pages.<br />  Mary, the &quot;heroine&quot; is a woman you can relate to.  How she comes to really love her husband, how she adjusts to her new surroundings; her jealousies, her heartbreak, her overall character.  The indian characters are wonderful, and really draw you in, you will want to know their story, and even though you already know the outcome, you are still routing for them to win their war.  Especially Bright Sun, what she goes through being a translator for the white man and the Sauk, being a woman indian in the time of war, trying to hold what she loves together, and what she believes...well some of it is truly heartbreaking.  You will admire her strength and courage.  The General, himself, is an unforgettable character, I only wish there was more info on his life.<br />  The story keeps you turning the pages to find out what is happening, it keeps the characters firmly planted in your head, and even your heart because you really &quot;feel&quot; for them, and the ending is wonderful, as well as satisfying, it ties up all the loose ends that you are waiting for throughout the book.<br />  Go west, young man,(woman), and take the journey.<br />Enjoy,  Debbi	2002-01-14

Wow was I wrong!<br />This story has it all!  Myths and legends that I hope I can remember so I can tell them to my daughter as a story someday.  Spiritual beliefs that are beautiful and daunting at the same time.  A sense of community that is like no other that I have seen.  A look into our past and the &quot;start&quot; of humans and humanity, and characters like no other!<br /> The Mog-ur, the highest magician in all the Clans, he speaks to the spirits, he is the one that holds all the rituals and ceremonies for the Clan, and he is the one that I would want on my side.  He takes to a little girl, Ayla, who is found on the way to a new cave by the most powerful medicine woman in all the clans, Iza.  Ayla is different, she is one of the Others.  She brings to the Clan luck (?), because of her strong totem, and causes more controversy than this Clan has seem in 35,000 years!<br />Ayla's story of trying to fit in, trying to overcome her &quot;ugliness&quot; and her differnces, trying to be accepted into the only family that she can remember, despite the fact that she has so many &quot;different&quot; ideas than a good Clan woman, is truly wonderful.  Each one of her struggles pulled at my heart, and the writing is so good, I found myself reading long into the night, wanting to find out what happened next.<br />This woman loved the whole story!  :)<br />Enjoy,<br />Debbi	2002-01-03

The history of the City, the early medicine and surgical practices, and the characters made this an all around great read.<br />It starts before the Revolutionary war and takes you through til' we won our Independence. You get insight into all kinds of different professions, including the &quot;oldest profession in the world&quot;, and the characters are so well drawn that you become involved with them as well as the history.  There are quite a few twists and turns which keep you turning the pages just to find out what happens next...and next...and next.<br />This is an epic novel and worth every word.  I also enjoyed, as an added bonus, finding out how Wall Street and Broadway and all of the other landmarks came into being.  I found myself trying to picture it all in my head the way it was and the way it is today, knowing that we, as Americans, will do everything to put it all together.

While The Great and Secret Show is still my all time favorite, what appealed to me about this story was that it was just your basic ghost/love story...with a twist.  I became so involved with the characters, that even though I didn't like them all the time, I understood their &quot;motivation&quot;.  I loved the legend of the Duke and Devils Country, and how he made it all seem so...real.  I must admit, I was a little taken aback by the eroticism, but I am not complaining  :)<br />So, sit back and relax in Barker's world.

Sometimes, as in this case, truth is harder to take than fiction.  These are stong, courageous women with a sense of what is really important, and the courage to survive in the circumstances they were forced into.  I think this is an important story of love, friendship, family and survival.  I was glad to get to know these women.  Ms. Tademy has a great style of writing, and the pictures of her family enhanced the story, made it really &quot;real&quot;.  It's hard to imagine, as you're reading, that these women, Elisabeth, Suzette, Philomene, had no &quot;say&quot; in what was happening to them and their lives; but they taught each succeeding generation how to be smarter, and stronger.  What was passed down the &quot;line&quot; was strength, courage, love...no matter what color. Enjoy!	2001-08-01

We take so much of life for granted, and when it's coming to an end, we often look back to see all the things we could/should have done differently.  For the beauty and simplicity of the stories by Grandma alone, this book is worth the read, if you have an elderly grandparent, like I do, it is a nice reminder that they were once young &amp; full of life, and that the important things they NEVER forget.  A truly touching story.<br />Enjoy  :)	2001-07-25

This is the first book by Fannie Flagg that I had the pleasure of reading and all I can say is Thank You!!!  What a great cast of characters; there is Dena Nordstrom, the worldly (?) and sophisticated young woman, trying to figure out just what life and love are all about, considering she can't remember what it felt like to be loved.  Her &quot;best friend&quot; Sookie, who thinks she knows Dena better than herself, and she may be right.  Norma and Mackey, the most lovable couple, funny and innocent, and just plain good folks, and Aunt Elner, with all the wisdom of the ages!  But lets not forget Elizabeth Diggers, who finally gets Dena to look at life and love, and Ira the rat!  Along with so many more lovable and human characters.<br />I really loved this story, I loved the way it unfolded to bring me back to the past and help me to understand the &quot;present&quot; lives of the characters.  I laughted and cried and felt all so human.<br />To anyone who liked the Ya Ya's read this book, you won't regret it!  Thanks again, Ms. Flagg  :)	2001-06-18

We start out so enthusiastic about our futures when we are young and &quot;invincible&quot;, and then we have to grow up.  Life comes along and demands it.  I was sorry that the people on 28 Barbary Lane had to move out, but don't we all leave home?  I was so sad to lose some of the characters that I truly loved, but haven't we all felt the same emotions when we have lost our own loved ones?  That is the beauty of Mr. Maupin's writing, you FEEL what is happening to the people in the story as if it were happening to you.  The friendships between these people was amazing.  I was glad to see Mona come back into the story, I had missed her, and I was glad to see that Mrs. Madrigal found someone to love too.  She was really great!  I will miss Mouse, Brian, Mary Anne, Thack, Mrs. M. and all the rest, but it's good to know that I only have to pick up these books to visit them again...and I will.<br />Enjoy!  Debbi	2001-06-12

I felt all the needs of a mother to want only the best for her daughter by trying to teach her lessons that she has already learned, and all the frustrations of the daughters who undoubtedly thought they knew better.  The stories of the mother's pasts were heartbreaking, the goals of the daughter's, inspiring, the lessons in Chinese culture more than  interesting.  This book pulled on my heart strings.  If you're a Mom, you will really enjoy this, even with the complicated relationships, if you have a daughter, give it to her to read, she will understand how very special being a daughter is and how very much we want for our daughters.<br />Enjoy!

I absolutely fell in love with the wolf/men (men being the operative word :)  and couldn't wait to get to the next page to find out what was going to happen.  Their strength, their loyalty to &quot;the pack&quot;, their respect for eachother...why don't humans ever act the way some animals do :)<br />Don't stop with this book, go right on to The Promise, it is just as good, if not better than The Passion, and will leave you asking where her next book is?<br />Debbi	2001-05-29

I'm almost done with this book and I am procrastinating...I DON'T want it to end!  Every character, every story, everything is extrodinary in these pages!  Mary Anne, Brian, Mona, Mrs. Madrigal, and especially Michael (Mouse), have become my new best friends.  I love listening to them talk, I love the little private jokes that I am a part of, I love their sense of humor and their quest for love, but most of all I love the bond of these characters to eachother; and to me!<br />The stories seem to flow together, pushing you to read the next chapter to find out what happens, and then the next chapter and the next and so on and so on...it's amazing that you CAN'T seem to put the book down, and it's a BIG book.<br />I'm a product of the Seventies, ie. I was a teenager in the 70's, and I loved all the 70's cliches, remembering what was happening in that decade in the news, with music, and even the products that were popular then, I found myself outlining all that was familiar to me then so I'd never forget  :)  .  The ease with which we lived our lives thinking that we were indestructable and the only thing we had to worry about was finding the right &quot;someone&quot; to share it with...before AIDS, before addiction was an epidemic, just a little pot and someone to love and we were just fine.  Then the 80's and life gets more complicated and alot more scary.  This is truly one of the finest books ever written, with some of the nobelest and bravest and most lovable people you will ever have the pleasure of meeting!  Thank you Mr. Maupin, Thank you, thank you, thank you!  Debbi	2001-05-29

This is the first story on the King Arthur myth that I have ever read, and though I knew of King Arthur and the Round Table, about Lancelet, the Merlin, and Guinefwer, I never really KNEW the story.  What a great intrduction into this world of magic, and Mysteries, fairies and religion.  Morgaine of The Fairies was a complex and interesting character.  She was so real, with attributes and flaws that you could relate to.  Sometimes I didn't like her but I always felt for her and the decisions she had to make to keep Avalon in the world.  Guienefwer was not the perfect Queen I had thought she was.  Lancelet was everything I thought he would be, handsome and brave, thoughtful and good despite his infatuation with the queen, he was the perfect Champion of the Queen.  I loved King Arthur, even when he turned his back on Avalon he did it because he thought it was right.  His heart was good.  All of the Knights of the Round Table were what you would expect them to be and more, and this story did not dissappoint in the telling of this wonderful myth from the women's point of view.  There was alot of talk about religion and the differences in the beliefs of the time, how christianity came to this part of the country and the world was so interesting.  The Goddess and the priestess's and their beliefs were something to keep you wondering about for many years to come.  How important it is to remember that the Earth and everything on it is blessed and that we should never take advantage of what God gave us or eachother.  This book made me think of everything that I learned in Sunday school, it made me question my beliefs and it made my faith stronger in not only God, but the Goddess, and the goodness in this world.	2001-05-24

I was telling the story to a friend and he asked me &quot;what happened next?&quot; and I couldn't tell him; so I continued...wow I am glad I did.  You get drawn into the characters of this book, rather than them hitting you over the head, and you want to know how everything turns out, and what happens next.  By the middle of the story, I was hooked and found it to be one of the best books I have read in a while.  Hang in there, the writing is a little hard at times, but it is well worth the journey.

I really liked this story, it is so far from anything I could ever imagine.  There are so many worlds and peoples that sometimes it wasn't always easy reading, but it is well worth the effort.  I was turned on to Clive Barker through this book and have been a fan ever since.  But this is no light, summer reading, this book takes work and thought.  If you stay with it I'm sure you won't be dissappointed.  Debbi	2001-05-18

I read Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood before I read Little Altars, and I think I should have read them in order.  While I Loved the Ya-Ya's and found so much to take away with me from that novel, I had questions about Sidda and her family, especially her mom, Vivi.  I found Little Altars to be a darker, sadder novel than the Ya-Ya's, but it gave me the history of the families and the background to fill in the blanks.  If you only read one of Wells novels, read the Ya'Ya's, but if you have the inclination, start with this one.  It is good and will leave you anticipating the next one.  Debbi	2001-05-18

Anne Rice took the folklore of Vampires and made it her own.  I absolutely loved the history of the Vampire's found in The Vampire Lestat and Queen of the Damned, which is my personal favorite.  The way she brought the reader all the way back to early egyptian times, gods and goddesses, etc. and weaved it all into a complete history of a character that we all thought we knew from &quot;Dracula&quot; was amazing.  I have not looked at a Vampire the same way since :)  I felt for all the characters, especially Lestat and Louis, but I really had strong feelings for Armand too, he was only a &quot;troubled teen&quot;, after all.  She just made everything come together beautifully, she is a real talent.  I will say that I was not all that fond of Body Snatchers, and I hated to see Lestat become what I consider wimpy.  All in all, these were some of my favorite books to escape with, and some of my favorite characters of all time. Debbi	2001-05-18

I loved the way the story unfolded from all the different sisters point of view,and the mothers.  I loved what I learned about Africa and the Congo.  I felt every joy and sadness as if I was a part of it, and the loss was almost unbearable.  I can't say enough about this wonderful story, or these characters, it stayed with me long after the last page.  Debbi	2001-05-18

Epic fantasy/horror/love story/adventure, this book has everything and more.  I was swept away into the imagination and mind of Barker and the characters were so real to me that they became a part of my life.  I Love this book!  This is an &quot;involved&quot; book; you become &quot;involved&quot;, and it stays with you for a long, long time.  I was eagerly awaiting the second book of the Art, Everville, but, I hate to say, that was a dissappointment.  It was readable, but did not hold a candle to  The Great and Secret Show	2001-05-18

Where is that Red Tent, anyway:)  I enjoyed this book so much that it is hard to put into words.  There is just so much here, but I think that most of all, I enjoyed the celebration of womanhood.  How nice it would be to treat our daughters and ourselves the way these women did.  I enjoyed the characters and the story, and the biblical lessons.  I have passed in on to my 18 year old daughter, and I hope she passes it on also.  A great read about life, women, even God.  I reccomend this book highly to every woman!  Debbi	2001-05-18

This is a story that focuses of the beliefs and the magic of seven friends who BELIEVED, really BELIEVED in the magic of themselves, and hung onto that belief when they needed it the most, even after it had faded into adulthood.  This is so much more than a horror story, it's characters are so much more than just characters in a story, they are your childhood friends, the ones you rode bikes with down the longest hill, the ones who told you not to pick up that penny because it was on the &quot;tails&quot; side, and that was bad luck, the ones who believed in all the MAGIC of friendship.  Once you pick it up, you won't put it down until the very last page, and then you'll want more.  I took this book everywhere, read it everywhere, and I did it twice :)  Let Stephen King take you back to the place where magic was within your reach just by holding onto the hands of your friends.	2001-05-09

I don't know why I couldn't get right into it.  My mother brought it back to me like she was holding the Holy Grail, and made me promise that I'd read it.  I owe her a debt of gratitude for that!  This is an amazing story!  The characters are so real, you feel what they feel, you see what they see, and when they are afraid...so are you!  That is what King does, he draws you in and makes you a part of the story.  He touches all of your emotions, and he makes you think...What if?  If you read nothing else by this man, please read The Stand, I promise you, you won't regret it...and you WILL read more King!	2001-05-09

I grew up with a Mom who had a group of women friends that resmbled the YaYa's in all their glory and tragedy.  As I read about the friendship and lives of these women I related to everything that was happening as if I lived these experiences.  At times hilarious, at times heartbreaking...you will love these women and their families, grow to understand their complexities, and even when they don't do the right thing, you understand their reasons.  They will become friends to remember long after you put the book down...reluctantly.	2001-04-26

You really feel for these women, and the struggle they go through to become what the Japanese men deem to be desirable.  I love the relationships between the women, with all the jealousies included.  I even admit to some culture shock not growing up in a country with such ingrained customs.  I felt bad for the little girl dragged into the life of a Geisha, but I rejoiced in the woman she became.  Readable, and very enjoyable.  I reccomend this book highly.	2001-04-26

I have read everything Mr. King has ever written, and for the most part, I love his writing, his sense of humor, his characterization.  I was a little disappointed when I started this novel, like everyone else, I was anticipating another &quot;It&quot;, or &quot;Stand&quot;, but as I got into it(200 pgs. or so), I found that I was coming to know the characters, and  getting involved in their lives.  I love the King-isms of all his books and I just enjoyed being with him again through another story.  True fans of King will like this book for that reason only.  Anyone who hasn't read King, should not start with this novel; this is for true King lovers only.	2001-04-04

I was really amazed that I could be so drawn into the story of a time, people, and place that I don't remember learning about even in history.  I was captivated by the personalities in this story, as well as the two that came after in this trilogy.  I literally could not put them down until I knew exactly what happened to the friends and people I truly admired in these stories.  This was the first historical fiction I ever read and I am hooked, at least on Penman and the heros and heroines in her stories and our past.  Read It, you won't be dissappointed, I promise you...Oprah should read this and reccommend it to the world, it deserves no less.	2001-03-20
