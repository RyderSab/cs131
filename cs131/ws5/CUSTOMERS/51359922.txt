US	51359922	RR4ZXNOKG3ZA3	0840734301	875075904	A Pocket Full of Pennies	Books	4	5	5	N	N	Simply stated, yet spiritually overwhelming	I've had this book on my shelf for quite some time - Mr. Amato actually gave it to my husband and I when he spoke at our church about 2 years ago. I finally found some time to read it.<br /><br />Blending a unique life experience with years of studying the Scriptures, Rick clearly and simply explains how God desires to make us rich, not necessarily financially, but spiritually. The key is to be on the look out for the \\"pennies,\\" or blessings that He puts in our path. Many of these blessings are not these giant things that drop in our path, rather, they can only be found when you are looking for them. And part of looking for them is becoming totally and completely devoted to listening at the Saviour's feet.<br /><br />To be honest, you need to read this book twice; when you've read it once through you'll realize why. Sitting down to read it a second time, slowly and reflectively, will allow you to glean all that Amato has to offer in this delightful book.	2005-10-12

The man had such an ego for power that it was all-consuming. His selfish desires led to the worst tragedies in modern history, all without the world ever really know what was really going on.<br /><br />Chang and Halliday have clearly put in a great deal of effort and it is no doubt that this book was years in the making. They delved into as many official and unofficial documents they could find, as well as interviewed everyone they could that had some kind of contact with Mao during his 82 years of life.<br /><br />To be honest, this book is certainly a hard read and may not be the best book for someone just taking an interest in Chinese history or Mao. However, for any Sinologist (professional or amateur), it is definitely a must to add to your personal library.	2005-10-04

Lewis and his writings will know that his books, especially his fictional pieces, are far more than just `nice stories.'<br /><br />Clive Staples Lewis was far more than an educator and writer; he was, at heart, a theologian that wanted to use his talents to share the truth of the Gospel (the Bible) in unique ways that helped others understand. His \\"Chronicles of Narnia\\" series is just one example.<br /><br />The most popular portion of this 7-part series is, undoubtedly, \\"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\\", which has been made into a motion picture (due in theatres around Christmas 2005). This is sure to wet the appetite of children and adults alike to delve deeper into Lewis' mystical world.<br /><br />Sara McLaughlin has long been a student of Lewis and his writings, and in this book, brushes the surface of many of the deeper, spiritual insights of \\"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe.\\"<br /><br />Her attempt is truly commendable.<br /><br />In simple terms that can easily be digested by the newest readers of the series, she does her best to cover a wide variety of the literary and spiritual aspects of Lewis' writing, including a basic understanding of the significance of it always being winter, and never Christmas in Narnia, as well as the symbolism of Aslan's self-sacrifice and resurrection from the dead.<br /><br />The only thing that brought my rating down was the desire for MORE! McLaughlin could truly create an expanded version of this book with greater detail in each chapter. I also recommend that you be at least familiar with the story before you read this book, whether you read the complete text by Lewis (preferably!) or simply see the movie in theatres this December.	2005-10-04

Kwan keeps you rivetted to his story, told through eyes of a young boy growing up in very turbulent times. In spite of coming from a wealthy family, it cannot save him from the terrors and turmoil brought to Northern China in the 1930s and 1940s, nor from the racial judgement passed on him for being half-Chinese and half-White.<br /><br />How Kwan manages to survive is quite amazing. He is abandoned by his own mother and faces major abuses at school. Then, war begins and he begins to witness the atrocities committed by the Japanese in China. Finally, after the Japanese are defeated, he nearly loses his father to the KMT government that his father has faithfuly served through the resistance movement. He is not even safe from his own family, who try to use him as a means to extort his father for money that no longer exists.<br /><br />An absolute must read for anyone interested in China, the Japanese invasion of China, and a boy's coming of age.	2005-01-23
US	51359922	RHVU05U4CLODF	0974575038	148349185	Goodbye Gutenberg: How a Bronx Teacher Defied 500 Years of Tradition and Launched an Astonishing Renaissance (Designer Writers)	Books	4	2	6	N	N	More than just a beautiful book	There is a good reason why people read more magazines than books - it is visually appetizing. While I may sit in a slightly different arena from most as a life-long bookworm, I see people of all ages resisting the written word. Least of all the things they want to read are things like newspapers and the classics.<br /><br /> In her freshman work, Valerie Kirschenbaum has brought a very unique point out - that in spite of the fact that we know have the opportunity to publish books of beauty that will `tempt the taste buds' of potential readers, we prefer to stick to the traditional black copy on white text. Even in advertising, we are taught that large bodies of text should be left in blocks, avoiding even reverse text (white copy on black).<br /><br />Ms. Kirschenbaum has really done her research; she brings to life the history of bookmaking sharing the history of many of the world's ancient cultures, including the Greeks, Mayans, Chinese and Medieval Europeans, among others. She also shares the desire of many of the world's most enjoyed authors and poets who desired to see their texts illustrated or illuminated.<br /><br />What made the difference? Why did we leave behind illustrated texts? The change came following the introduction of Gutenberg's printing press, on which the first English-language Bible was printed. However, although I don't think Ms. Kirschenbaum intends this, she almost comes across in an accusatory fashion that Gutenberg had some sort of mass conspiracy to remove beauty from the text. Of course, that is not really the case - it was the course of history that made printing in colour cost-prohibitive even until the latter part of the 20th Century.<br /><br />Kirschenbaum is also critical of the male-dominated publishing business (which has been so for centuries), almost too severely.<br /><br />In spite of these two main complaints, Ms. Kirschenbaum's passion to reach out to an ever-increasing population of non-readers is clearly felt. Her concept of a `designer writer' is much needed; however, I do see that if her more people write texts that are illustrated and illuminated - that is books for adults - they are more likely to be a combined effort between writers and graphic designers. It takes a truly talented person that can do both.<br /><br />It is important to point out that a designer writer must be ready to be critiqued on two levels - first on the text itself, and second on their graphic design/art skills. Ms. Kirschenbaum has done a very good job on the design of the book, however, on some pages, the design, I feel, detracts from the text, or even makes it difficult to read. What Ms. Kirschenbaum has to stay is still the most important part of the book.  Also, while her personally-design font, Booklady, is pleasant, it is a little difficult to read in large blocks.<br /><br />In all, Ms. Kirschenbaum has taken a bold step and I commend her for sharing her personal faith and passions.Her concept of a `designer writer' is much needed; however, I do see that if her more people write texts that are illustrated and illuminated - that is books for adults - they are more likely to be a combined effort between writers and graphic designers.

Truly the voice and the body didn't match.<br /><br />However, Clay is a real person - not some made-up personality like many of those gathering in Hollywood. In spite of abandonment, mental abuse and never \\"fitting in,\\" he was raised with a set of morals and values that are so uncommon these days. Better yet, he wants to stand up and be an example that you don't have to give in and be something you are not.<br /><br />To be honest, my favourite part of the book was when Clay talked candidly about his faith. He is a Christian who loves the Lord and wants to use the gifts, talents and opportunities that God has given him to make a stand and set an example.<br /><br />Clay still has a long way to go; however, he has come such a long way already. I look forward to see how God is going to use him, both as a role model, and as an instrument reaching out to special needs children.	2004-12-31

I first read Adeline Yen Mah's book, Falling Leaves, and recognized Adeline Yen Mah's name when my sister gave me this book for Christmas.<br /><br />Few children in the West can fully understand what it means to go without, particularly the love of parents. Even when there isn't much money to go around, most of the families in the US or Bermuda still have family that do the best they can to make sure each child knows that they are an important part of the family. In other cultures, this isn't always the case as superstition can lead to believing that a newborn child left behind when a mother dies in childbirth is cursed.<br /><br />That was the case for Adeline. Her older siblings treated her brutily for \\"killing\\" their mother. Her step-mother wished she, and her full siblings, weren't around. And her father, her own father, didn't know her birthday, or could he even remember her real, Chinese name.<br /><br />In spite of being abandoned and mentally, emotionally and physically abused, Adeline proved that even the youngest child can rise above adversity. She knew that she had a responsibility to at least herself to apply herself to her studies to make something of herself so that she wouldn't be forced getting married at a young age and never finishing school, like her older sister.<br /><br />I encourage parents, especially mothers, to pick up a copy of this book for their children, especially their daughters. It will help children better understand the value of what they have and how to appreciate it so much more.	2004-12-31

Even though this book is a few years old now (I read it about 5 yrs ago), what McDowell and Hostetler have said in this book still stands true. Looking back over the last 60 years or so, if you really want to know what went wrong with society, this is the book to read.	2001-05-14

After being diagnosed with Fibromyalgia, and then told I wasn't allowed to exercise, my body has become stiff and its even hard to bend over to pick something off the floor.

Ye's memoir keeps you hooked into the story of her life, giving details when necessary. You get to see the Cultural Revolution through the eyes of a child - her eyes. Also wonderful is how she is not bitter about her experiences - cautious, but not bitter. It is an excellent read that you won't be able to put down.	2001-05-13

Although it did use it in preparing for my GRE, I don't think it added much to my score. The software is very outdated and not very useful.

I was more than happy with my copy. It is easy to look up specific events, and great for general browsing. I only had two complaints - one, that there was MORE detail in it (although that would have been very hard for a single volume!), and two, it didn't come with the CD that was made to go with it.	2001-05-08

It gives the reader a good understanding of what many of the world's major religions believe, and how evangelical Christians can  view them. Every church library needs a copy of this book. The one downside  is that it only covers the major religious groupings. If you are looking  for information on a more abscure group, you probably won't find it here.	2000-05-18

In many cases, especially covering areas that see more visitors than others, the coverage is excellent, very detailed. HOWEVER, for areas  that see fewer visitors (like the section on Changsha, Hunan), there are  several errors, usually in the area of places to stay and eat. (In past  editions of this book, the map of Changsha was wrong. I do not know whether  this has been corrected.) It almost appears that the person who was  supposed to cover this area couldn't be bothered to really check the city  out.<br />No matter what, whether you are just going for a short visit OR  going to live there for a while, you must pack this book. IT WILL BE A  BIBLE TO LIVE BY!	2000-02-25

The story and the history was excellent; the descriptions vivid. I could hardly put it down. But, Mr. Topping is a newspaper man, and his  journalistic style sometimes came through in the dialog between characters,  and often sounded like he was quoting an interviewee.<br />All in all, it is a  definite must have for any one with an interest in Chinese history and  fiction.	2000-02-25
