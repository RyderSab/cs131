I actually found out about A Message From Garcia through an email spam. It was touted as \\"different.\\" I'm not sure how different since many books of this genre are usually speaking the same message, just with different examples and perspectives. But, it was easy to read and kept me turning the page. I really liked the \\"how to\\" aspect of the book. After all, it isn't any good reading about other people's success if you don't know how to make your own.<br /><br />A big \\"different\\" -- The book was augmented with a website called Success Compass which helps you set goals and then e-mails you a reminder at whatever frequency you wish, even several times a day. I guess the key to success is not allowing yourself to forget what you want, and the Success Compass website doesn't let you forget. I liked it and I think you'll like it too.	2005-01-04

Although I have been a MM user since way back, MindManager X5 has some very nifty enhancements. I didn't upgrade from MM2002 until I got the book and then I just let loose.<br />If you're new to MindManager, this will get you started and give you some neat tips.

And for that I am grateful to Ms. Einsohn. In the process of writing, revising, writing some more and revising again, the editing procedures and formalities I garnered has help me become a better writer. I review my drafts in a different light, understanding now the editor's decision to move a sentence or a paragraph to make my writing clearer.<br />This book sits between my Chicago Manual of Style and Elements of Style, each complementing the other.

No in-between, but, that's where I fall. Overall, a good book. I am glad I took the time to read it. I especially enjoyed Part II: The Writing. In this section the author describes methods in character and plot development to rewriting, the biggest part of writing.<br />Throughout the book we learn about the author's failed marriages, friends, students, small-time and big-time author associates. I hope these passages were meant to emphasize \\"to write what you know.\\" Her point of view was definitely the women's point and I'm not sure what her references to sex and using four-letter words were all about. They came and went very quickly. Maybe the idea was that sex sells.<br />I do agree with her chapter \\"A Thousand Words a Day.\\" It's a goal I don't always hit, but then sometimes I exceed it. A writer must write, many times garbage, sometime genius, but write everyday. The author says to take weekends off, but I don't always get away with that either.<br />I'd recommend a few other books like, Lerner's \\"The Forest for the Trees,\\" Brande's \\"Becoming a Writer,\\" and Ueland's \\"If You Want to Write\\" before this book, but I did walk away with thoughts and ideas to ponder, which is all I request of any book. Enjoy it.	2003-08-10

There I read Critical Questions and tried to answer them. These weren't questions about the material I had just read, but questions about me and my organization and how we deal with problems. Subsequently, the end of each chapter brought more questions to work on.<br /><br />The book focuses on the problem solving process and the search for the real problem.

But, its subtitle is more succint, \\"A Book about Art, Independence and Spirit.\\" The book answers the question \\"Why should we all use our creative power and write or paint or play music, or whatever it tells us to do?\\"<br />She uses examples from Blake, Chekhov, Tolstoi, Sandburg and other creative writers, and sprinkles in Mozart, Van Gogh, Monet and God. We read much about imagination and creativity, and how our internal and external critics suppress us. She explores how to bring what is inside us all to the surface and to be thankful for it. If your are exploring your imagination and creativity, be it through writing, drawing, composing, acting, programming, entreprenuering or just living life, read this book, savor it and then read it again.

With this book he has given me reasons to confirm my belief that charging a client based on my time and materials used in a project is a problem for both myself AND my client. First I am not true to the client when I bill time just for showing up but not providing any value. Then, how do you compare the value of one who charges $150 for one hour versus the consultant who charges $150 for 2 hours (at $75/hour)? Is one better than the other? Why put the client in a position to make that decision. Basing charges on value (either real or perceived) to the client removes hourly rates from the equation.<br />Yes, all this is based on having true relationships with your clients and Mr. Weiss goes through many different iterations of working with your clients on finding value, education them on value and providing value. There are lots of quick stories and references to his own consulting engagements, many of which are the same ones used as examples in many of his other books, which he not so subtley sells in this one. But then again it is one of the \\"Ultimate Consultant\\" series of books he has recently published.<br />Enjoyable and educational reading which has brought about many heated conversations with my peer group about rates and charging clients. It should provoke you also.	2002-11-30

Photocopy these twelve pages when you finish the book to always remind yourself about \\"keeping lean.\\"<br />After reading Building a Project-Driven Enterprise and learning about Lean Project Management, you will have another tool in your tool belt. Use it as you would other tools, such as the theory of constraints, Total Quality Management, Six Sigma, Balance Scorecard, or the Project Management Book of Knowledge. There is much to use here while not being burdened with monotone, textbook dribble.<br />The book is easy and yes, fun to read. It is peppered with case studies, anecdotes, and stories, well written in a light, conversational tone. The author asks you questions throughout to make you think and form your own answers prior to reading his approach. I believe anyone in business will find value in this book, but project managers will relate closely with the waste-slashing ideas.	2002-11-17
