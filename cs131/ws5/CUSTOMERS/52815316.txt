This is not the best edition if you want good reproductions of drawings. But in terms of getting a good text for a good price it's great. <br /> <br />I'm not really going to review the book itself as I assume most people who are here know that this was Gauguin's attempt to put together a what he hoped would be a best selling travelogue that would promote his art.  He was hoping to cash in on the success of Pierre Loti's best seller the Marriage of Loti which was set in exotic Tahiti. It never made any money, but this is mostly because of it's idiosyncratic style.  But for anyone interested in Gauguin's Tahitian experience it's great.  Also check out his intimate journals which came out posthumously and cover also his life before Tahiti.	2005-09-08

If you like Darvas's first book it is certainly worth reading to gain little insights on his method which youdon't get in the first.  There a few new anecdotes and a chapter which explains his method but on the whole the book is not as amusing a read and lacks the freshness of the first, nor do I think it takes his story much farther than where the last ends.

You get a feel for th time and the author discusses a few of his trades and tells a few anecdotes but there is no earthshattering wisdom imparted.  It won't hurt to read but you will find youself a litle disappointed by it's brevity.  I would have enjoyed it more if there were more war stories but clearly the period was not period of active trading particularly if you had a small account as the author started out with.  If you're trader you can glean something from any true experieince and this is no different. So if you want to spend the money and are willing to spend the 20 minutes to read then go ahead otherwise read Reminiscences of a Stock Operator or Market Wizards etc.	2004-11-06

Moving from one promotion to the next, seemingly effortlessly.  When they do encounter obstacles and setbacks or seem stymied, they some how mangage to sidestep it or often it turns to their advantage.  These executives seem invincible.  Is it just dumb luck or is there something at work here?  Tom Schweich has some answers.  Continuing in vein of his earlier books Tom has taken things a step further.  He has gone out and interviewed some of the most successful people of our time and distilled the essence of their successes.  Like his other books though he has plenty of war stories from mainstream business world.  What I liek about htis book, though is that it does go outside the corporate world.  He interview some exotics. There are rock divas and politicians.   It's great reading, enjoyable, and written in a clear organised style that you may be familiar with in his previous books.   You don't need to be an executive to enjoy and benefit form this book. There are enough universal principles expounded for anyone.<BR>A very timely book for the difficult economic times we're headed into.<br />Incidentally don't pay attention to the 1 star review.

The unexpected disaster awaits you sooner than you might think.  What are you doing to protect yourself?  Little actions with unforseen consequences can easily be avoided if you are prepared.<br />How many times have you thought how stupid of me I should have foreseen that this might happen if I did this.  Now there is a book that lays out in a very straighforward manner all the things that can go wrong and how through simple steps you can prevent them.   This book teaches you how to build a bulwark against the forces of entropy.<br />It will not prevent all disasters but it will save you from most of the ones that you can unwittingly bring down upon yourself as well as how to lessen the damage from the ones you can't control.<br />A very timely book. It reads  well.  Section One on job security is worth the price alone.  I found myself breezing through it and then rereading it.  The true life examples of people who wrecked their careers as well as those who deftly sidestepped disasters are fascinating.   It reads like a survival manual for today's workplace jungle.  Two and three are invaluable and are filled with reference material regarding financial and tort protection that you would need several books to duplicate and even then wouldn't be as clearly laid out or as enjoyable to read. <br />I'm getting a few for friends.	2002-01-07

There is also a great chapter on ASP as well as a chapter on moving data efficiently between tiers which are not my main focus. I didn't give it 5 stars because already it's a little dated. Nothing really on ADO 2.6 or SQL Server 2000.

There are a couple of nice chapters on using stored procedures to access SQL Server quickly.  This book is also nice in that has lot of hand holding for getting around SQL Server itself, but this book is definitely for beginners.  Even for me coming from an Access background and no experience with SQL server found it a little too basic and dry.  I don't regret getting it though, I find it's not the book I find my self turning to.  But it does spell it out if you're willing to wade through it. I would not get this book as a reference work.

Well it tries to be but it isn't.  It's a fairly shallow knock off. <br />The main problem that is that author is not a day trader himself which while not necessairly a bad thing in itself means that half the time he doesn't know where to focus.  That's what makes the Schwager books so good.  His book is written for traders by a trader.<br />The second problem is that no strict documentation of trading success was required.  <br />The third is that the interview is all rehashed by the author and so you don't get the real dialogue which makes you wonder what's getting lost in the translation.<br />Having said all that, every book has some value so if you have the money go ahead and get it.  At the very least you can take a look at some traders and their style. You may glean something. <br />But get Market Wizards or Reminiscences of  a Stock Operator if you really want  an introduction to trading.<br />This book is a far cry from those.	2001-03-23

Most of the reviews complain about the book.  Yes, there are some deficiencies.  One wonders about the inclusion of a people that don't seem to strictly be traders but on the whole I would rather have the book than not have it.  Sure it's not as great as the first, but for the money it's far better than most of the trading books out there.  You won't learn any specific trading systems perhaps with the exception of Mark Cook and Stuart Walton who were more open than the others about what they do, perhaps because their systems are not really systems but are based more on their own intuition and some basic guiding principles.  None the less you will learn the more important aspects of trading as you do in the old books.  It's also good to see who's out there and what they're doing and how they got there.   <br />What do people expect?  To be handed the keys the kingdom for the cost of a Schwab commission?  Give me a break.  Be thankful these guys even allowed themselves to be interviewed.<br />But I agree Schwager has probably been too busy trading or trying to trade to devote himself to this book in the same way he did to the last ones.  Too bad for us but can you blame him.<br />What I would like to see if he does another one is a follow up on some of the original market wizards.  What happened?  Are they retired? Still trading?  Did they blow up?  <br />Well you get the picture.  Schwager, if you're out there reading this.   It's still a pretty good book. Thanks.	2001-02-08

Sure you get an occasional day here or there where they perform well, but for the most part if you back test you won't find anything here.   It may be possible to filter these trades, but so far no one has stepped forward to tell you how.  Certainly not Jeff Cooper in this book. For the person who has lost only a point per trade with the success ratio that I've found that would bankrupt you fairly quickly. The book may have some value as a stimulus to thinking.  These patterns may have worked once.  As with anything good you need to find your own patterns and do your own work.  The book is not worth it's price.  It should be discounted.

This anthology spans 1941-1988. It's a great read, not only for it's insights into art but also for capturing the flavour of the time.  In a sense it let's you stand behind Motherwell's shoulder and peer into his thoughts and see how he viewed modern art both from a philosophical view point as well as aesthetic.  <br />A lot of it is drawn from his public writings and speeches but a lot is fairly personal in nature, taken from his journals.<br />It's well annotated and useful if you're interested in the abstract movement.	2000-11-06

It's up  to you  to find the  water.  The author may  give you some pointers as  to where you might  find it but you may easily die of thirst  trying to get there. <br />At best, this an introduction to  the author's trading methodology.   It broadly covers her  different  techniques:  Elliot  Wave  used  in  conjunction  with oscillators, Fibonacci  price projections and  retracements, Gann time and  price  analysis, reverse  engineering  of  indicators to  project price.  Sounds good  doesn't it?   Well don't  hold your  breath.  The author keeps the secret of the Holy Grail to herself.  If you want the answers,  you will  have  to take  her  seminars or  subscribe to  her service. <br />Just  to give you a sense  of what I mean:  One chapter is entitled \\"Price  Projections by Reverse-Engineering Indicators\\". You get four pages of excruciating detail on how to export into excel, but when it comes to  how she actually reverse engineers the indicator she writes, &quot;Just  know that some reverse-engineering projections require you to  know the indicator formula and  to have Excel generate the results,  rather than just  plugging in the indicator  values from Trade  station.&quot; How  does  she do  it?   She hired  professional programmers to do it for her.  Yes, that's all very well but then what do we need the book for and  why are we paying her?  Then there is the infamous Composite Index indicator so  essential to her system. It has been repeatedly commented on in the other reviews here. She repeatedly promises to  discuss the formula  in various parts  of the book  and a whole chapter is  devoted to it.  The author  writes, &quot;By now you are probably trying to find the formula for the Composite Index&quot;. No such luck.  Instead, you get, &quot;Forgive my inconveniencing you, but  look  toward the  Aerodynamic  Investments  Web  site... for  the outcome of this sticky dilemma.&quot; What a tease!<br />And those aren't the only secret  keys she keeps. In the chapter on  Gann you find that all  the wisdom  of Gann  is useless  for trading  indexes  unless you possess  certain  secret conversion  factors  unknown  by the  general public, but which were revealed in some letters of Gann possessed by a friend  of the  Author.  These  documents were  mysteriously destroyed upon his death.  &quot;All my attempts to acquire them or to have them preserved failed.,&quot;  she writes. At any rate  she's not revealing the conversion factors.  <br />Later she writes, \\"While the revelation that a  conversion factor is used will  understandably discourage some of  you  from  going further  and  tempt  you  to skip  the  remaining chapter...\\"  and then tries  to lure  you in  with \\"So  hang in there  as this discussion  has only  scratched the  surface.  Besides, aren't you curious about the  fourth dimension within the pyramid that I  passed over so  quickly in  the beginning  of this  chapter?  Good. Thought that  might work. Onward.\\" But  all the reader  gets on the pyramid is three  scanty sentences in a paragraph  in which the author states that  there are three dimensions  in a Pyramid.   But hold your horses,  there is  also a  fourth  dimension: time.  \\"It is  Gann's Master Calculator or Square of 52,\\" the author states.  This fourth dimension can be derived from  the Pyramid, but here the author leaves you ruminating once  again this time about how  to divine the mystical qualities of the  Pyramid.  You will never know.<br />Ah,  but isn't that why we bought  the book in the  first place, to find out  what we will never know?   Don't think to transgress  the portals of  the Temple of Giseh.	2000-08-26
