What I mean by this is that the book makes for entertaining reading, but factually, you need to take much of it with a grain of salt. The latter chapters on the Saladin, Mary Celeste and Zero seem to be fairly accurate. The preceding chapters cover John Phillips, Edward Low, Edward and Margaret Jordan, Blackbeard, William Kidd, Bartholemew Roberts, Samuel Hall, Thomas Pound, Peter Easton and Henry Mainwarring. These early chapters contain a good deal of fictionalized content that makes for excellent reading and perpetuates a number of myths.<br /><br />One of the things that bothers me about the book is the author's choice to cite three of his works (on treasure hunting and Oak Island) and a number of semi-fictional works in the bibliography of this book.<br /><br />As always, though, it is necessary to read a number of works in history to garner the sparkling gems of truth from the many grains of sand. The gems are here, but so is the sand, and the author is aware of them as evidenced by his preface, \\"As with all stories obscured by time, there are probably inaccuracies in my accounts,...\\".<br /><br />Bottom line, a good book for young pirate aficionados, but be aware of the shortcomings and look to a number of other books for a consensus on the real stories. In particular, I find Angus Konstam to be a good reference.<br /><br />P-)	2005-10-07

The author does indeed drift around at times, leaving a topic unfinished to explore other avenues before returning to the original topic. We, also, are not talking about much in the way of original material (much of it comes from Captain Charles Johnson, Alexandre Exquemelin, and recent authors like David Cordingly).<br /><br />However, there are redeeming qualities to the book. For one it is an entertaining read, the author uses a smooth style that makes for easy reading. The author covers a range of topics from ships, weapons and havens to the origins of and suppression of piracy during the Golden Age. There are numerous names mentioned, from the well known and notorious to the lesser know footnotes in history. The period covered spans from the early 1500s to the early 1800s, told for the most part from the English and French point of view.<br /><br />In short, a good book for an overview or brief reference (although I still recommend David Cordingly or Angus Konstam for broader, more polished coverage or pirates).<br /><br />P-)	2005-08-20

If there is one complaint that I have about the book, it is that it is dated, continued research in the field would argue for an updated edition of the book.<br /><br />The four sections of the book cover the workings of the brain, what to eat, what supplements to take and how to prevent vascular problems from affecting your brain. True to her usual form the author presents the research for each topic, broken up by nutrient or supplement, further broken down by details of the impact on the brain of a shortage and the research data to support claims that the nutrient or supplement may correct the problems, and how much to take for full effect.<br /><br />The discussions are intriguing in that the author's conclusions require so little action on the reader's part to correct or prevent the stated neurological problems (topics range from depression to aggression to forgetfulness to age related problems like Alzheimer's).<br /><br />One of the reasons I bought this book was because I was heading back to grad school (in my 40s), and I wasn't quite sure I was up to it. Having completed 13 semester credits in biological and chemical sciences over two 6 week summer sessions with a flawless 4.0 grade average, I can say that I feel at the top of my mental game and ready for admission to grad school. My current set of supplements include: a multivitamin with minerals, coenzyme Q10, Omega 3 fish oil, ginko biloba and grape seed extract.<br /><br />Getting back to my initial statement, unless you have a perfect diet (be honest), you need a multivitamin with minerals to ensure that you are providing the basic nutrition for a healthy brain, once you are there you can look into the other supplements for further improvement.

The letters are printed in fairly original form (although in type rather than script) with minimal modification to enhance the readability without changing the sense of the content.<br /><br />I normally do not find tomes of letters and memos to be of great interest in themselves, nor am I a Nelson scholar who will devour everything and anything on the subject. As such, I found the book fairly dry reading. However, Colin White has done a great service by printing this correspondence to help make the material more readily available for historical research, as well as providing a reasonable categorization of the pieces. He also provides a nice bit of commentary to introduce each topic, helping the reader with some context with which to view the letters. It would appear that these letters do shed some new light on lesser known areas of the life of Nelson, but I would not look for any earth shattering revelations. There are a couple of nice appendices including a nice timeline and the ships he commanded.<br /><br />For those more interested in a biography of Nelson, I would suggest For God and Glory: Lord Nelson and His Way of War by Joel Hayward.	2005-07-09

The subtitle, 'From Novice to Professional', can be a tad misleading for the novice coder. A beginning programming book covers a lot of material that this book assumes the reader already understands. Many software books include a 'Who Is This Book For' section that offers some guidance on the suitable reader knowledge level, not this one.<br /><br />That said, I found this book to be very helpful. The sections on installing and configuring Apache, PHP and MySQL certainly saved me many hours of reading the online documentation and tweaking of settings while setting up my local test bed. That, in itself, made me a very happy camper. The author goes on to cover the various aspects from the basics of the PHP language and class libraries to topics like Authentication, Security, Session Handlers and eMail functionality that help anyone new to PHP setup some fairly sophisticated site capabilities.<br /><br />The second edition has been supplemented with an added 200 pages, including a new section on PEAR (PHP Extension and Application Repository). This is a wealth of prewritten classes and packages that can be used to add even more sophisticated functionality to the novice's web development toolbox. The author demonstrates several of the more prominent packages.<br /><br />The second edition has greatly beefed up with additional coverage of MySQL 5, including chapters on stored procedures, triggers and the PHP mysqli extension (all missed in the first edition). Most of the examples offered are clean and general enough to be useful templates for the reader's tailoring.<br /><br />My suggestion for novices to PHP is read through chapter 9, then skip to the various sections that solve specific problems being faced or are of particular interest, including installing and configuring your local test bed.<br /><br />Bottom line, the first edition was a good book for intermediate to veteran programmers looking for a quick tutorial on PHP (circa version 5.0); the second edition is even better. Novice programmers should ensure that they have a full understanding of the basics of programming (and OOP) before attempting it. I would now use this book to teach a class on PHP.<br />P-)HP (circa version 5.0); the second edition is even better.

He discusses the various impacts the liquor has had through the ages on slavery, economics, trade, religion, prohibition, military and holidays. While much of the book is entertaining reading, there were times when I had to force my way through chapters to get back into the rhythm.<br /><br />I cannot legitimately question much of the factual nature of the author's work. However, being somewhat well read on the topic of pirates, I can say that the author has used fairly superficial research and reported stories that are not necessarily true. That said, this was not a book on pirates; it is about rum, and I have to leave it to those more knowledgeable in other areas to comment on the general factuality of the book.<br /><br />One item sadly missing from the book is an index of the recipes which the author kindly includes at the end of each chapter.

A man who seemingly mixed equally with pirates, lord of the Admiralty and kissed the hand of the queen. A celebrated author, accomplished navigator, respected naturalist and active enough to board enemy ships or cut logwood. A little more art in his soul and we would acknowledge him as a renaissance man. As expected the book centers on Dampier's life from about 1674 to 1715 when he died; it covers the three trips around the world and his short periods of life in England while writing his books. The authors add a few digressions to cover associated world events, framing Dampier's life and giving perspective to his actions or troubles.<br /><br />While I disagree with a couple of the authors' statements on piracy (having read my share on the subject), I found their work to be enjoyable reading and worthy of a prominent place in my reference material on piracy.<br /><br />P-)	2005-03-25

The author does a wonderful job of presenting the case for 21 such remedies in a reasonably scientific manner, with a minimum of sensationalism (yes, there is some, how can you avoid it in this genre, the book is called Miracle Cures after all).<br /><br />Let me say upfront, I am a skeptic. I firmly believe in the adage - if it seems too good to be true, it almost certainly is not. However, Jean Carper, presents each remedy or supplement in such a straight forward manner that the claims seem reasonable, and for the cost of a few supplements, you have to ask yourself - Why not?<br /><br />Each chapter covers one remedy, with sections on - what it is, how it works, supporting evidence (in the form of tests and trials), who should take it, how much to take, and consumer concerns (good brands so you don't get burned by buying bogus stuff).

After all, why read about a place when you can turn on the travel channel and see it in living color? Well, for one reason, it's reading! But, I'll try not to climb up on my soapbox. Unsworth does a wonderful job of presenting a textual picture of the people, culture and history of this cradle of civilization. His insights on travels to the scenic countryside, tourist Mecas and ruins of past civilizations on this Mediterranean island provide the reader with more than just pictures; he provides us with the flavors and smells, awakening the senses of our imagination more than any passive media presentation.<br /><br />The bottom line is that this is not an exhaustive treatment of the history, geography or culture of Crete, nor is it a picture book; it is a throwback to a time when travel was not the commodity of the everyday man, a time when we lived vicariously through the likes of Hemmingway and Stevenson. If all you want is to see beautiful scenery, there are any number of picture books or web sites to entertain you, but if you want to experience Crete without the trip, you will want to read this book.<br /><br />P-)	2004-09-18

I think of small and pricey. And, that is about right for this book. The content is good: a single black and white picture per tank, its specifications and a short history. The tanks are divided by nation and listed somewhat chronologically. There is quite a bit of information packed into this little book.<br /><br />On the down side, the book lacks an index, and covers only one model of each tank (for example the German Pzkw IV shows the specifications for only the H model). In most respects this is a very nice little reference, but you will need something bigger for a complete reference.<br /><br />P-)	2004-08-31

So, there a certainly parts that no longer apply to the current state of Web Design.<br />However, there are still portions that are pertinent and valuable for web designers, especially those just getting into the art. The author offers guidance from broad design principles to specifics of forms, frames and graphics. The basics have not really changed, just the tools. The layout of the book by topic makes it very useful for reference and the samples provide a basis for the budding web developer and designer (WDaD) to build on. Couple this book with any of a number of good HTML and Scripting books and the new WDaD will be well on their way toward designing usable and appealing web sites.<br />Bottom line - not worth list price at the time of this review; if you can get it at a steep discount it is still worth getting.

He has provided a modest amount of background to set the stage for the actual events centered around the period from 1801-1812. His history ranges from the American capital to the shores of Tripoli, dealing with politicians, diplomats and military officers.<br />Much of the story focuses on the events that transpired in the Mediterranean Sea, remote from the direction of the politicians in the United States. Memorable names like Stephen Decatur, William Bainbridge, Isaac Hull and David Porter feature prominently. While they may not have been Nelson's 'band of brothers', they were the core of the United States navy that, along with it's new super frigates (Constitution, President and United States), stood toe to toe with the British fleet during the War of 1812.<br />Wheelan's history does not fail to cover William Eaton's cross desert march that brought the conflict to the Barbary shores in earnest. With due credit given to Presley O'Bannon, lieutenant in the fledgling United States Marines.<br />The one complaint I have of the book is that the author insists on trying to make some tenuous connection between the war with the Barbary Corsairs and the United States current 'War on Terror'. The only real similarity between the corsairs and the current terrorists is that they both involve the regions of North Africa and Middle East. Fortunately, he gives up the effort within the first 100 pages and gets on with the narrative.	2004-06-25

Written in diary fashion, it makes a good story to read to a child at bedtime with lots of convenient places to stop.  The author uses a good deal of nautical terminology, but does a good job of explaining it all within the context of story.<br />The story revolves around the diary of a young boy off to sea for his first time. He ends up with pirates when his ship is captured and after a few adventures returns home to accept a pardon. Richard Platt has authored several children's books about pirates and does justice to the reality of life at sea and with pirates without getting too graphic.<br />The illustrations are entertaining pen drawings that contribute to the story, although the style takes a bit of getting used to (I'm still not sure I like it). The book also includes a brief overview of the history of piracy and some famous pirates. The index also doubles as a glossary of some of the terms used. P-)	2004-04-19

He interleaves the stories in a successful effort to provide tension and suspense, keeping the reader interested throughout the book.<br />The first story is a narrative of the underwater exploration of the site of the wreck of Jean Comte d'Estr&eacute;es fleet off Las Aves island. He details the interpersonal relationships and trials of gaining approval to explore the wrecks in foreign waters. While I am not very interested in underwater archeology, Clifford made these segments entertaining and very readable.<br />For my interest, the other thread of the book was the real meat. Barry Clifford provides a detailed history of several of the major figures from the beginning of the Golden Age of Piracy, specifically 1678 to about 1700. He provides a good deal of information on the Chevalier de Grammont, de Graf, Thomas Paine (not the author of Common Sense) and Nikolaas Van Hoorn. Clifford recounts the many sackings of towns, and interactions with local governments, including the changing attitudes as the years wore on.<br />Overall, I found this to be an entertaining and informative read. I may have to look into finding copies of his other books. For more information on piracy in the Caribbean (from the Spanish viewpoint) try Pirates in the Caribbean :1493-1720 by Cruz Apestegui.

Reading through the first chapter of this book you get a feeling that something is amiss, and it dawns on you that you are reading about the depredations of the Sea-dogs, buccaneers, flibustiers and pirates from the Spanish viewpoint. After years and years of reading the heroic exploits of the Elizabethan Sea-dogs it is refreshing to read another opinion.<br />The author has provided ample illustrations, maps and pictures to help the reader visualize the narrative. While there are the usual names and places, Morgan, de Graf, Drake, Tortuga, Port Royal, Hipanola; the author has provided additional material on Spanish Costa Guarda and privateers. He also, spends a good deal of time detailing the Spanish efforts to deal with the scourge of piracy, from fortresses to warning towers. At times the reading is slow, but the novelty of the viewpoint always carries the reader forward wondering what new twists on the old stories might appear.<br />Yet another book for my pirate library; it enjoys a place next to my copy of Angus Konstam's The History of Pirates.

The author switches back and forth between presenting biographical information about Captain Kidd and an evolution of the declining use of privateers and pirates as tools of foreign policy. The writing is smooth and well thought out, providing an entertaining read.<br />I found the information on the attitudes toward pirates during the late 17th and early 18th centuries interesting and chock full of little know tidbits. The biography of William Kidd was eventful and conforms with what I have read in other sources. The author takes the story from early accounts to Kidd's first appearance in the Caribbean to the arrival in New York and on through the fateful trip that sealed his fate. Ritchie uses the general information on the attitude toward pirates to reinforce the conclusion that Kidd was doomed from the moment he surrendered in New York, and to provide some insight into why Kidd did surrender.<br />My one complaint revolves around the author's conclusion that Kidd was actually guilty of piracy and should have been convicted. It is not that the author reaches that conclusion, after all the evidence can point to that conclusion, however, I had the feeling from the first page that the author's intent was to prove Kidd guilty. Casting off the guise of impartial historian that early in the book has to raise the question - has the author's attitude spilled over into the data presented? That said, it is important to read multiple views to get a better understanding of the history, and I did find this book to be both entertaining and informative.<br />For an alternate view of the William Kidd story try The Pirate Hunter by Richard Zacks.

Sure it's dated; like much of this genre it relies heavily on the technology from the time it was written (for that matter most of the techno-thriller genre is dated by the time it hits the stores). But the techno stuff is only the superficial element of the story. Much of the action takes place at a level that could be set in WWII or present day with a few tweaks of the equipment.<br />The story begins on the DMZ between North and South Korea with a little action, that can easily fail to hook you, but keep reading. There is quite a bit of setup for the story before the action begins, but once it begins, the momentum will drag you through the rest of the book in no time. As far as accuracy, there are certain parts I have to accept on trust, however, having spent all of 1983 in Seoul, traveled around the country a little, done some little time as a ground pounder, in tanks and with artillery as well as some time as a remf; those aspects are fairly realistic.<br />The story thread hops between approximately 5-6 main characters (pilots, generals, politicians, civilians, and frontline troops) and a few one shot characters in a pretty successful effort at building and maintaining tension. This is a keeper for me; I'll no doubt read it again in a few years.<br />For other books in the genre, check-out Red Storm Rising by Tom Clancy or for something on a more tactical scale try Team Yankee by Harold Coyle.

That said, however, Allcorn does a wonderful job of presenting a good history of the fortifications. The book begins with a brief overview of the political and sociological rational behind the line. It then dives into a fairly detailed dissection of the fortress works, large and small from Northern France down through the Alps and on along the border with Italy. This coverage of the structures is the meat of the book, followed by a short discussion/narrative of the action surrounding the forts during the early and later years of the war.<br />The illustrations are everything you would expect from Osprey. They include maps, graphs, cut-away images, photographs and historical concept images. The author concludes the book with a section on visiting/touring the forts and some resources for further information.

The story is standard Burroughs, sticking pretty well to his formula - man falls in love with girl, rescues girl, loses girl, rescues girl, loses girl, ..., man and girl live happily ever after.<br />ERB's heroes are seldom less than perfect and when they are (as in this book) they usually rise above it through the love of a good woman, this story remains true to that form. It  looks to have been serialized, as many of his stories were, with many a shift of location. The reader is taken from Chicago to Hawaii to a Pacific Island to New York to Mexico with the all of the accompanying naivete of the times. Whether he is battling pirates, head hunting samurai, evil hoboes, Mexican bandits or his own personal demons you can't help but enjoy the raw power of the main character.<br />For all of it's simple story and predictable events, this remains a fun book to read, excellent for pre and early teens and those of us that just want a little old fashioned escapism.<br />For further adventures of Bridge see the Oakdale Affair.

The author has done a great job collecting first hand accounts from veteran airborne, rangers and special forces soldiers from World War II. He has transcribed them, ordered them by campaign/battle and provided some context so that the reader can place them within the broader scope of the war.<br />The problem I have is that that is all he has done, and while this preserves these first hand accounts and provides a valuable resource, it does not make for a readable treatment of the subject. There is a reason most of these men have not written books telling their story and a reason why you cannot just dictate a book. It makes for difficult and sometimes even painful reading. I don't want to be mean or vicious, and the author has done a great service by collecting all of these first hand accounts, but it almost seems as if he lost his motivation when it came to putting it all together and telling the story. O'Connell, has basically served as little more than an editor piecing together collected episodes, making little effort to put it all together into a comprehensive story, leaving the reader with a disjointed rambling.<br />As a readable history, I have to pan this book. The saving grace is that authors and researchers will have the collected material to use in future works. P-)	2003-09-03

I'm sure my wife got tired of hearing me praise the author's work. This is the second book I have read by Atkinson, the first was The Long Gray Line, and if anything he has refined his craft to a new high. I have not read history this entertaining or well researched in a long time.<br />This book is the first of a three volume series covering the United States Army/Military involvement in the liberation of Europe during World War II. This first volume covers the initial action in North Africa during 1942-1943. Atkinson details the preparation, battles and politics of this first campaign of the war for Eisenhower and the army. The author spares no feelings in a sequential narration of the stumbling and missteps of the campaign. Likewise he is not sparing in his praise for the heroics and gallantry of the line troops.<br />My impression was that the author was fairly unbiased, but in effect this is the story of Americans interacting with Europeans. Any scholar of history will tell you that you cannot get the whole story from a single book, as even the most diligent author/researcher will fall victim to creeping bias or missed source. I get the impression that Atkinson has tried very hard to limit the effect of either of these diseases. In his favor, the author, fails to write down to the reader, assuming that it will be adults, with mature vocabularies and tempering. If I had to pick one thing to criticize about this book, it would be the disappointed feeling I had when I discovered that the last 125 pages or so of the book were devoted to Notes, Acknowledgements and Bibliography rather than more of the story/narrative.<br />I anxiously await the next installment of this series.

Eisenhower, does an admirable job of making the story of the United States Army in World War I readable. The author provides numerous details that flesh out the bare skeleton provided by other authors. He covers the buildup of forces, including a generous section on the logistics of moving to Europe and supplying it once it arrived. Eisenhower, also, offers valuable information and insights on the American Expeditionary Force, from senior figures like Pershing and Harbord to early views of Patton and MacArthur. Eisenhower's coverage of the battles and conflicts involving the US Army are not comprehensive, and you have to wonder if they were really meant to be, or meant as examples from which the reader can infer the details of other battles not covered. The coverage of the political/command battles provides another facet of the US involvement missed by many other books.<br />As any serious reader of history knows, you cannot get the whole story from any one book or author. In order to get a balanced and comprehensive view of history, the reader must look to multiple sources. This book makes an excellent companion to John Keegan's The First World War, providing a missing piece. It provides a source of balance and detail that Keegan neglects. However, it is not the be all and end all of the story; there are still plenty of missing pieces.<br />P-)	2003-07-22

The major combatants are no longer diametrically opposed, and the concept for the novel is not as plausible as it was at the time it was written. That is the critical part, however, I really enjoyed the book. I still have my copy of Red Storm Rising and this one has earned a place on my bookshelf beside it.<br />Coyle does an excellent job. The story provides a minimal intro to the conflict and a minor side show with the evacuation of the servicemen's families, but the meat of the story is the telling of the combat actions. I haven't been in an M-1, so I have to assume that the details are accurate enough. However, I have driven, fired and TC'ed an M-60 during training at Knox, so I can say that the author has given a pretty good feel for the armored attitude and experience. Coyle tells the story from the perspective of company commander and based upon my own limited experiences has much of the details, as far as the operational and planning side, of command correct as well.<br />Given all of the above, my biggest complaint about the book was that I wanted the story to last longer; I was enjoying it too much to want it to end.<br />P-)	2003-07-22

Very possibly the closest we may get. Zacks has done a compelling amount of research from the English archives to the colonial archives to some of the sites involved. He presents for comparison as much detail of the lives of two men living roughly parallel lives with the various points of divergence. It would have been hard to fill a book with the existing details of William Kidd's life without verging over into the boring realm of historical manuscript. Rather than take that path, Zacks, chose to compare and contrast William Kidd and Robert Culliford, contemporaries, whose paths crossed at several instances throughout their lives.<br />As a result, we have been given a lively narrative focused on the adult life of William Kidd, interspersed with the life of Robert Culliford, arch pirate. Given the research, we can forgive Zacks the suppositions and surmises he makes to flesh out the narrative. The story goes a long way toward dispelling many of the myths associated with the man, Captain Kidd.<br />If the book lacks in any way, it is the limited use of images, including any picture of William Kidd, although Zacks references one early on in the book. The maps used for reference are older period maps with the appropriate names, but of limited use and difficult to read. That said, this book has become a valued member of my pirate library and easily deserves the highest ranking.<br />P-)	2003-07-17

Crusoe embodies the very soul of the period Englishman, making this work a valuable piece of literature in understanding this point of reference when studying the period.<br />The other aspect of the story worth noting is the evolution of Crusoe from the wandering free-spirit to the responsible, benevolent civilized man, a metaphor for the development of England from a small island nation to the Imperial caretaker of much of the world.<br />And, no one compares with N.C.

I browsed through most of the current versions of Access references, checking the details, coverage and examples for something that might meet my requirements. While it is impossible for any book to be everything to everyone, this one comes very close to meeting my needs with regard to Access.<br />Note, this is not a manual for learning SQL, or VBA. Both essential if you want to really step beyond the basic elements of Access usage. However, this book addresses the essential usage elements of working with Access - tables, queries, forms and reports - as well as several less `basic' elements like security, environment customization, and multi-user environments. The material is extensive, the examples are well explained, and the topics are well organized. If I were to teach a class on Access, I'd use this as the text.<br />I have not been disappointed with this book. P-)	2003-01-02
US	35560012	RDMLJWH54IEI	1874416508	728487659	Instant SQL Programming	Books	4	5	5	N	N	A Good Start	Probably not the best book ever written for SQL, let alone for beginners.<br />However, it is the one I used to learn SQL. It covers the basics in a fairly concise manner, enough so to be able to move on to a more advanced book. I read it cover-to-cover, and didn't agonize over the side-tracking or standards discussions. What I wanted was the details on the syntax of the language and an understanding of what the statements do, and that is what was provided along with some basic examples. By the end of the book, I was able to use SQL at a novice level.<br />I'm not sure I'd use this book to teach a class on beginning SQL, but as a quick and dirty read to get a first taste of the language, it fits.

To quote Miller from his preface, \\"Commager was, understandably, too emotionally involved in the war to write an unsparing acount of it.\\", and of himself he writes \\"...I am an American interested in the character and conduct of my countrymen.\\"<br />This is not meant to detract from the quality of the work. The book is well written, with a consistent style. It is hard to tell where Commager leaves off and Miller picks up. The narrative is heavily supported by relevant passages and quotes from the soldiers and journalists involved in the action. It provides a feel for the actual events (at least as far as print can do that).<br />In order to fully understand historical events it is necessary to understand the various viewpoints. This book, written by Americans, primarily for Americans, presents a valuable view of one facet of the jewel that is history.	2002-10-12

It includes narratives of all the old favorites: Blackbeard, Kidd, Roberts, Bonny and others. As usual, Johnson's prose is preserved and some of the original illustrations grace the pages. The editor/publisher has includes a glossary, bibliography and notes to the original text.<br />However, the down side of this particular volume is that it includes only a subset of Johnson's original writings. And, there is no added index with which to quickly reference particular names and such. While I don't quite agree that the editor has ruined the original, I do find that this version falls short of its potential. P-)	2002-09-18

It contains narratives on all the old favorites: Blackbeard, Kidd, Roberts, Bonny to name a few.<br />The things that set this text slightly above the others of its ilk are the coverage of more pirates than just the usual favorites, less 'constructive' deletion of the original text, and the inclusion of an index. I could go on and on about how useful an adequate index is when attempting to hunt down information on a particular ship or pirate, but I won't. P-)	2002-09-18

What it is is an entertaining read. It details several stories of buried treasure from Cocos Island to Mahe in the Seychelles. Providing a good deal of background information on the area and characters involved in each story. Tantalizing details are presented, that almost make you believe that the stories might be true.<br />The reality is pirates didn't bury treasure, they spent it, some few invested it and retired wealthy, but the vast majority squandered their riches on booze and women. Never-the-less, the lure of money for nothing, just waiting to be dug up, will always have some pulling out a shovel and pick to go hunting. And let's face it, we all dream about it. P-)	2002-09-17

There IS material in here that I have not seen in other books; however, a good portion is rewritten from Captain Charles Johnson's A General History of Pirates.<br />The book is reprinted from the 1837 version and an entertaining read. It is not generally a children's book. As to the factual nature of the narratives, it's hard to say. Like several of the other pirate books I have reviewed, this one is an important part of balanced view of what piracy is really about. P-)	2002-09-17

Officially, this book is taken for the work of Captain Charles Johnson. It is a compilation of narratives about various individual pirates from the Golden Age of Piracy, names like Blackbeard and Bartholomew Roberts (the dread pirate Roberts, from Princess Bride fame), Anne Bonny et al.<br />The conclusion that Defoe and Johnson were one and the same has come under fire these last few years and is not the accepted fact it once was. This text includes portions of the original volumes by Johnson, but not the whole, although it can be argued that it includes the stories that most readers would want. There is also some question about the validity of the stories, but we may never know whether they are true or fiction. P-)	2002-09-17

Not all were 'captains', but that's not really material to the focus of the book, which is to provide the reader with ample examples of women who worked in the maritime trade (in one way or another).<br />The topics range from royalty and psuedo-royalty, to pirates, to wives. For the most part the women are of strong character and know what they want. Druett, writes well and the stories are entertaining and well researched.	2002-09-17

However, this is a high quality overview of the history of pirates from earliest recorded times onward. Konstam breaks it down by era, from the ancient world on, with discussion of the periods, famous names and regions.<br /><br />While the textual content is well written and researched. the graphic content is probably even more impressive. The inclusion of maps and period images make this an entertaining as well as informative read. P-)	2002-09-14

Cordingly covers the history, the movies, the books, the truths and the untruths. He covers the pirate havens, common practices, origins, the big names and little names. Not just a dry narrative, but a fun read.<br />If you were to buy one book on the topic of piracy, this should be it (Angus Konstam's History of Pirates would be next in line). It is a must for any budding pirate historian. P-)	2002-09-14

It includes coverage of books, authors, movies, actors, places and, you got it, actual pirates. If you want information of something piratical this is a good first place to look. There's a lot left out though, so I'd consider this as a good beginning on a more comprehensive book.<br />One big caution though, Rogozinski, doesn't seem to be overly constrained by history, so don't take everything written in this book as gospel.

A period when Britain and France polarized Europe in war. While the ultimate outcome of the conflict bears out the fact that Britain's naval forces were superior, it is hard to believe that there were as few French naval successes as Woodman relates.<br />But that's a small complaint when taken in context with the overall quality of the content in the book. Woodman's descriptive talent focuses on the telling of the smaller battles. There are ample books relating the events of Trefalgar, this is not one of them, Woodman's narratives are of the frigate battles and smaller ship of the line battles, the cutting outs and ship to ship running fights. The tales of Captains Pellew, Cochrane, Willoughby and such. Stories no less entertaining than those of Forester's Horatio Hornblower. His terminology is accurate, and his research is excellent.	2002-09-14

Unlike his Second World War, he not only relates the events of the conflict, he digs into the characters and voices opinions on the futility of the whole First World War. So many soldiers died for so little reason. He clearly imparts the pointlessness, much like one gets from reading All Quiet on the Western Front.<br /><br />The telling of events is excellent through to the last chapter, then he winds everything up in about 20 pages, almost as if he was tired of the whole topic. There is material enough for 2-3 more chapters in the last 6-12 months of the war, but Keegan skims over the last offensives, relegates the American involvement to a footnote and leaves discussion of the aftermath to books on the Second World War.<br /><br />I recommend reading this book and John Eisenhower's Yanks : The Epic Story of the American Army in World War I to get a balanced view of the whole war.	2002-09-06

While they seem to make efforts to maintain an unbiased telling of the story, it becomes obvious that they have definite opinions. This is not a bad thing, just worth keeping in mind while reading. The overview maintains a reasonable chronology of events while hopping back and forth between the Western, Russian and Pacific theaters.<br />One thing that sets this discussion of the war somewhat above the others I have read is the authors' analysis of many of the major characters both military and political in all of the theaters. They do not limit themselves to a mere telling of the list of events; they delve into the motivations of the various players. Definitely an intersting read. P-)	2002-09-06

It unfolds form the causes through the early years of Axis victory through the turning point and into final defeat. The one flaw in the book that I found myself dwelling upon as I read farther into it, was the lack of insight or opinion evidenced by the author. He seems to be reciting the events without relating much of the feeling as if in front of a class.<br />His one concession to bias or insight seems to be his repeated justification or excuse for the actions or failures of Montgomery. Otherwise, he yields no reference to grasp his position on the telling of the events. This is a fine overview for those looking for just that. P-)	2002-09-06
