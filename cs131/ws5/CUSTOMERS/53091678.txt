There are hundreds and hundreds of recipes that I can't wait to try.  Not to mention that it's entertaining to read; several evenings I've sat and read it like a novel.  If you're bored with your current repetoire, this will definitely provide the cure.  All the recipes I've tried have been terrific.  I've owned this cookbook less than a month, and already I've made one recipe THREE times.  'nuff said.  <br />I always appreciate it, though, when reviewers compare a book to other similar books, in case I'm trying to decide between several.  So I'll add this:  the recipes definitely tend toward the adventurous.  Spicy, unusual, even exotic.  That's not a problem for me, I love adventurous food.  But if you don't, this probably isn't the cookbook for you.  It also lacks some standard recipes-- i.e., there's a recipe for Hillbilly Hummus (made with black-eyed peas, and it's a winner) but there's no recipe for just plain hummus.  So there you have it.  It's definitely a five-star cookbook, though; like some of the other reviewers, I'd give it more stars if I could.	2003-01-23

She gives birth prematurely, alone in her family's barn.  After the birth, she falls asleep.  When she wakes up, the baby is gone, and young and naive as she is, she is sure God has answered her prayer.  It takes the reader the rest of the book to find out what happened to the baby.  It's a fascinating story, with lots of interesting information about the Amish.  Picoult must have done mountains of research, because she manages to make a group of people who are usually relentlessly idealized so interesting and real.  But the courtroom scenes run on WAY too long, and they don't make sense at times.  There are some major plot gaps.  And the ending seemed tacked on; the more I thought about it, the less it \\"worked\\" for me.  I've been caught by surprise endings before and mentally congratulated the author for pulling it off so well (a couple of Elizabeth George's books come to mind)-- but this ending just doesn't make sense.  I can't say more without giving it away, of course, but be prepared-- have a friend read it at the same time so you can talk about the ending!!  <br />Overall, a great read.  It would make a terrific book group selection-- not only is there lots of fascinating stuff in here, but the controversial ending will keep you talking.  This is the first book of Picoult's I've read, I'm interested to see what the others are like.	2002-11-25

Books	4	7	7	N	N	terrific	I love having friends over and I love to eat good food, but I'm not the type that likes to spend hours in the kitchen.  If I can fix good food with 20 minutes of effort, why spend hours?  There's a LONG list of things I'd rather do than cook!!  If that sounds familiar to you, you'll love this cookbook.  I bought it a few weeks before hosting a family reunion of 14 people for nearly a week.  Nearly everything I cooked that week was prompted by a recipe or an idea in this book, and it all turned out great.  Highly recommended.	2002-08-10

There is no doubt in my mind that what Mesich describes is possible, because my own experiences are similar, though I'm not as vulnerable to other's emotions as she is.  The idea that this empathic ability might contribute to recurring depression was a mind-blower to me, but immediately obvious once it was pointed out.  It has completely shifted my own approach to dealing with depression, with very positive results (in the six weeks since I read it).  *However*, if you share this book with your non-sensitive friends and family members, be prepared to endure skepticism and even ridicule.  It's pretty &quot;out there&quot; for people who haven't had similar experiences.  In fact, my only major objection to the book is that she writes as someone from &quot;inside&quot; the alternative medical field, without an objective standpoint to explain or defend her statements in a way that will stand up to those who by default, automatically dismiss anything not backed up by randomized double-blind studies with p of less than...whatever.  :-)  For people of this ilk, I'd recommend starting with one of Elaine Aron's books instead.	2002-05-31

I haven't worn a pair of high heels since my rehearsal dinner nearly eighteen years ago; makeup is something I put on in five minutes for my husband's annual christmas party; and I still don't know what I want to do with my life--compared to her highly successful career, stylish TV appearances, weekly newspaper columns, etc.  But underneath the surface, we're both &quot;mommies,&quot; and that experience of trying to meet the infinite needs of your children while keeping a self intact is universal.  Or at least, *now* I know it's universal, after reading this book.  I found it warmhearted, encouraging, and practical--even when I knew I'd never do what she's suggesting.  And even though all of her books have included discussions of highly personal topics, this one seemed even more personal to me, as if she were truly baring her soul at certain spots.  I'd highly recommend it, especially to those, like me, whose youngest child is approaching school age and suddenly there is a light at the end of the tunnel--a thought both longed-for and (I find to my surprise) a bit dreaded.<br />My only complaint, though, is the incredibly sloppy editing.  There are typos, misspellings, punctuation marks missing (like periods at the end of sentences).  Not Iovine's fault, of course, but the publisher has to be making a fortune off these books, you'd think they could afford a proofreader.	2002-02-08

Just wanted to make clear to parents who are reading here:  there is quite a bit of &quot;fowl&quot; language &lt;ark&gt; and violence in this book, including some fairly graphic gore.  We read it aloud, so it was easy to edit out, but I was surprised in a book aimed at this age group at the amount there was to edit.  If your kids watch PG-13 movies (our oldest does), it won't be anything they haven't heard or seen, but I admit I was a bit offended to find it in a book aimed at this age group.  Maybe because it seems so out of place when reading out loud as a family.  And also because you could so easily leave it out without ruining a kid's enjoyment of the story.<br />For the most part, we enjoyed this book.  It was boring at times, which seemed odd for a book billed as a suspense novel.  I would have liked it a lot more without the epilogue--the ending redeems Artemis a bit, but then the epilogue takes it all back (I can't say more without ruining the ending, which imo was the best part of the book).  It's a fun read, but we were all definitely ready to move on to the next book by the time we were done--unlike some other books, which we were sorry to have end.	2001-09-21

It got me started cleaning out closets and organizing cabinets, which I had been meaning to do since we moved two years ago.  But I suspect this book will work best for those without kids.  I was disappointed in the lack of specific strategies to deal with the incredible amount of stuff that comes into our house every day.  happy meal toys, birthday party favor bags, pine cones, feathers and rocks they collect outside.  And paper!  We can get 3-5 lbs of paper a day between junk mail, homework, schedules, newsletters. it's endless.  I don't think she has a clue what it's like to live with kids.  If you live alone in a 3rd world country, sure you can keep your clutter down and never get to the point where there's more than two bagsful of trash in your house at any one time.  But me, I'd be happy if I could just keep my kitchen counter clear.  I've found other books written specifically for families to be much more helpful (and in fact, Family Fun magazine has some great ideas in its May 2001 issue, far more useful than the vague &quot;throw it all out&quot; attitude that Ms. Kingston has).	2001-05-04
US	53091678	RY1VD3MMDBY5H	0380973464	555229230	Cryptonomicon	Books	5	4	5	N	Y	don't miss	I've only read a handful of novels in the last ten years that I would give five stars, but I'm not hesitating for an instant here.  Cryptonomicon is absolutely amazing.  It sucked me in and kept me absorbed from start to finish (and at 900+ pages, that's saying something).  Having said that, though, I will proceed to complain about it.  You could start with the women characters, who are entirely flat.  Besides Amy, none of them are interested in anything except collecting furniture and using sex (or the lack of it) for emotional blackmail.  And even Amy is completely incomprehensible.  One could, I suppose, forgive him for making her a cipher--that is after all, the theme of the novel.  But she comes off more like a 90's techno-geek's version of Mae West, a fantasy, takes on whatever shape Stephenson needed her to for the mood he was in.  I never could understand why Randy was so in love with her.  Since I'm one of the (probably)(relatively) small number of women interested in this novel, I'd guess that's not a problem to most readers.  And Stephenson's women are no worse with 90% of the male characters created by women authors.  It's just disappointing--the male characters are SO well-written.<br />But my main gripe, far more irritating than the women, is Stephenson's inability to leave anything out.  I swung between awe at his verbal prowess and irritation at his editor's lack of guts on nearly every page, sometimes within the same paragraph.  Stephenson's ability to turn a phrase, spin an image, see ordinary objects in some entirely new, bizarre way, is simply astonishing.  But sometimes it's also just plain old tedious.  There are multi-page asides on everything from pipe organs to dust devils, interesting ideas that are carried to rococo extremes lasting for pages.  If he (Stephenson) had been anywhere within range when I tried to read Randy's 18-page monotype trip report while supervising my 3-year-old and his 4-year-old best friend at a Burger King playland,I would have strangled him.  (and if you thought that sentence was convoluted, trust me, you will hate this book.)  The lengthy asides are fun at the beginning of the book, but by the time you've read 700+ pages, you're ready to find out what happens.<br />But still I'd say to almost anyone:  read it.  It sucks you in, it makes you think (and laugh!), it's heaven on earth if what you want is an intelligent, interesting (make that fascinating) read.  If the mere heft of it doesn't turn you off and its central theme (untangling cryptic information of every conceivable type, from military intelligence to the strange ways of the human heart) interests you at all, dig in, you won't be sorry.  But if you want a quick, easy read that you can squeeze in between diaper changes, fair warning:  this one will send you right round the bend.	2001-03-10

Maybe I am just too cynical to be reached by this  book, but I couldn't even get through it.  His tone came across to me as  smug and self-righteous.  He and his community and his family can't  possibly be as wonderful as he tries to convince us they are.  He  also  seems (oddly) naive.  As someone who grew up in a conservative religious  community (though not &quot;plain,&quot; I confess), I can tell you that  for every positive, wonderful thing about it, there is an equally strong  negative.  They are not utopias.  They are full of flawed human beings who  can inflict deep, slow-to-heal wounds on those who don't fit in.  Surely  Mr. Savage can see that there is a big difference between voluntarily  choosing as an adult to make the choices he has made and being raised in  such a community with three or four generations of tradition behind you and  feeling nearly strangled by all that weight.  While that doesn't invalidate  Mr. Savage's good experiences with the plain people, it does indicate that  it is not the community he has chosen, but the fact that he *is* choosing,  discovering his own values and making hard choices to live up to those  values, that is important.  His smug self-satisfaction with the plain  lifestyle would be bearable if he acknowledged that there are other ways to  achieve spiritual depth, but he doesn't--or at least, not in the first half  of the book, which is as far as I could make it.  I'm giving it three  stars, though, because there were some very interesting descriptions of how  the Amish and Quakers live and believe--and also for his daughter Tasha's  wonderful puns, which I won't spoil for you if you are planning on reading  it. :-)	2000-09-14

While preparing for an extended car camping trip, I pulled it out again and was once again amazed at the breadth of recipes.  There are recipes, variations of recipes, ideas for  recipes, tips, hints, &quot;chef's secrets&quot;--her wealth of ideas is  practically awe-inspiring.  It's a terrific book just for leafing through  and getting ideas.  At home, I strive for fresh ingredients and creative  cooking; while camping, ease of preparation and ease of clean-up are my  primary rules.  There are recipes in this book that meet each of those  situations, and more than a few that meet both.  Sure, there are a few I'll  never use (even while camping I can't quite bring myself to eat Spam), but  overall there's no better resource.  I've bought several other camping  cookbooks recently, but this one retains its spot as my most treasured  camping cookbook.	2000-06-04

Although we'll be forever grateful to JKRowling for getting her hooked on reading, we've had a difficult time since then finding books that stood up  to the comparison (at least in her mind).  This is one of the few that  have.  It is absorbing and suspenseful--we read it aloud, and anyone in the  family that is old enough to read was caught at least once sneaking a look  ahead (strictly against the rules in our family!).  And since I've always  been interested in the story of Shahrazad, it was fascinating to see it  fleshed out.  It had never occurred to me what a heavy burden it would have  been for her to save not only her own life but those of hundreds of other  women by telling stories night after night.  <br />Anyway--this is a great  book, especially for reading aloud.  It doesn't have quite the pizzazz or  made-for-the-movies aura that Harry Potter has, but in my opinion, that's a  good thing.  And it finally got my daughter out of re-reading Harry for the  umpteenth time and trying some new books.	2000-05-15

But for my family (we're mainly car campers, already outfitted with tent, sleeping bags, and Coleman stove) it is nearly useless.  I was mainly looking for creative recipes that are easy to fix outdoors, but there are only a few recipes, and about half of them are impractical for us.  Lots of info about cooking without a stove, choosing a tent and sleeping bags, etc.  OK, but not very useful to me.	2000-05-10

It took me 3 months to get through the first half of the  novel--this from someone who rarely spends more than 4-5 days reading a  novel, no matter what it's length.  It wasn't that it was so badly written,  in fact, it's beautifully written (although the devices she uses to  distingush between their voices become gimmicky after awhile).  It's just  that it's very difficult to read, I simply could not understand why they  stayed.  I don't think I'm spoiling the plot by giving away that they  eventually leave--it's foreshadowed from the very first chapter.  And for  me, that was when the novel became interesting, to see how these women  handled the shambles their lives had become.  Although Leah is the one I  admired most, I ended up liking Rachel in spite of her shallow political  and racial views, simply because she was such a breath of fresh air after  Leah's political fanaticism--which oddly echoed her father's religious  obsession.  And I found it fascinating that Adah had carried so much as the  family scapegoat because of a deformity that existed only in the minds of  the family.  As another reviewer said, though, I would have liked to have  Leah's thoughts (at the very end) about the gift she would give her father  but if you stick it out this is the most rewarding book I've read that was  published in the last 2-3 years.	2000-01-21

There's no question it's not Kay's best writing, as many other reviewers have pointed out, but on the  other hand, many of his other, better written works don't have the impact  of this one.  If you're sensitive to matters of style, Kay's early writing  with it's overblown and self-consciously high-minded tone will drive you  nuts.  Half a dozen times I came close to throwing down this book in  disgust.  But don't.  Exaggerated it may be, but there are scenes in this  book (and the other two) that will live in your mind forever, and rightly  so.  I wouldn't argue for it's inclusion in the top 10 sf/fantasy books of  all time, but on the other hand, I'd 50 times rather re-read &quot;The  Summer Tree&quot; than most of the books that made Amazon's list of the top  sf/fantasy books of the century.	1999-10-22

Stephenson's vision of the future is mind blowing.   His ability to take technology currently in its  infancy and envision where it might go is simply astounding.  Diamond Age  is far more rewarding than Snow Crash, but still has some of the same  problems--the convoluted plot becomes so huge and complicated that it  collapses at the end.  But even if it had NO plot, it would still be worth  reading.  In fact, I might even re-read it, something I usually reserve  only for cherished books from childhood.	1999-08-22

But if you're just the average American, trying to get a grip on where your money goes and what  you should do with it, I haven't read a better book.  Partly because  Orman's enthusiasm is so contagious and her approach so refreshingly  non-financial, if you can imagine that.  I think after reading this book  you'd be far more likely to actually go out and DO the things she suggests  than with most personal finance books.  You have to read through some weird  stuff about money's energy and money is like a person, but behind the new  age voodoo, her advice is solid.  Bottom line:  if you have a knack for  dealing with money, you don't need this book.  But if you're one of the  rest of us, buy it quick.	1998-12-14

And I have to confess that it took me  awhile to get over his self-conscious Irish brogue--yes, I do realize that  he IS Irish, but especially since his accent occasionally disappears, the  skeptic in me has to wonder if he's not taking advantage of the current  Yankee fascination with all things Irish and Scottish by broadening his  brogue as much as possible at strategic moments.  But by the end of the  first side of the first tape, he had won me over.  He has a wonderful,  gentle way of enlarging one's vision, getting you to look up and away from  endless therapy-induced navel gazing, to acknowledge the wonder of simply  existing on this planet.  It's a good reminder for anyone who is healing  from a deep wound.  (and of course there's far more to what he says than  that simple synopsis).  I highly recommend this tape to anyone who is  healing (from anything); I'd guess it wouldn't make much sense to someone  who isn't.	1998-12-13

The text is tender and thoughtful (although perhaps a tad on the precious side), the illustrations are sweet but not overly so--Bear comes across as an energetic little guy, even though he is alone.   But I do have two suggestions, don't know if anyone from the publisher will  read this to hear them!  One is to publish it as a board book; the hardback  version might not last long with the intended age group.  And the other is  to publish a &quot;Bear by Herself&quot; version, with a little girl bear,  sort of like the two versions of &quot;Once Upon a Potty.&quot; ;-)  I'm  not rabid about being politically correct, but this seems to me to be a  book that particularly lends itself to personalization; I think young kids  will really identify with Bear.	1998-12-05

After a lifetime of reading fantasy books with male heroes (from Charles Wallace to Peter Pevensy to Thomas Covenant to Harry Potter, with  Frodo and Garion and a host of others along the way) here was finally a  book with a wonderful, witty, brave, funny, heartwarming *girl* at it's  very center.  But Subtle Knife, while interesting and well written and  definitely a page-turner, turns Lyra into a groveling sidekick to Will, who  won't even look at her alethiometer without Will's permission.  I suppose  this makes me sound like some sort of virulent feminist, and I'm not.  I  just hadn't realized how much I had enjoyed Lyra's personality until it  turned to mush in this sequel.  Maybe the third novel will remedy this, but  it's hard to see how--at the end of this novel, everything points to Will.   I'm still fascinated to see exactly how the final battle will play out, but  extremely disappointed in The Subtle Knife.	1998-12-01

Books	4	4	6	N	N	lovely nostalgic writing	The parts of this novel that take place in Berie's past are so achingly well written that even when they are funny, you are too deeply moved to laugh.  The Berie in Paris in the present, though, is much harder to  fathom, and her husband is nearly opaque.  I felt that Moore intended  Berie's decision about the marriage at the end of the novel to be a moment  of insight and maturity, but instead, I couldn't figure out if she was  being mature or stupidly co-dependent.  Moore has a talent for outrageous  sentence and paragraph building, which sometimes works and sometimes  distracts.  It's a beautiful novel, definitely stronger on mood and  meditative nostalgia than on plot.  Occasionally I found myself wishing  that she'd let up on the verbal pyrotechnics and get on with the story.   But I'm glad I read it, and will recommend it to friends.	1998-11-15

The eight humans start out thinking Rakhat is  an idyllic world; by the end, the catalog of horrors they have endured is  so greusome that it begins to push at the limits of the reader's  guillibility (certainly holds your attention, though).  But in spite of the  unthinkable monstrosities described, and even the dark night of the soul  Sandoz endures, this novel still somehow manages to come across as glib and  contrived.  In the early days, the characters spend countless hours wiping  tears of mirth from their eyes from jokes that aren't funny, unable to  believe how lucky they are to have found such funny, lovable friends.   Believing they are stranded on Rakhat, they have a &quot;Barney&quot;  moment where they realize we have each other and IT'S OKAY. you practically  think they are going to burst into the Barney theme song.  And even Sandoz,  who endures far more than any of the others and like Job's servant, lives  to tell the tale, has his cathartic moment and comes out right at the end.   Russell raises many ancient, important questions, but by the end, all the  characters seem the same, everything is resolved, and nobody seems to have  learned a thing.  I kept waiting for one character to say, &quot;You know,  we got blinded by the glory of what we were doing, and we made some major  mistakes out of innocence and stupidity and naivete,&quot; but it never  happens.  The questions all seem to revolve around where is God when bad  things happen?  Don't get me wrong--this novel is well worth reading, and  would make a great book for a reading group or book club.  I just thought  the lack of depth and complexity was disappointing.	1998-10-08

I was... well, underwhelmed, shall we say.  I am a big Mary Stewart fan, and have read at least a dozen of her wonderful books.  But this one was populated with unbelievable characters, stock plot situations and besides, it was boring.  :)	1998-07-06

But reading through the other reviews, I find myself agreeing with a lot of the negative ones.  I wonder if you have to have been raised in the South to fully appreciate these women??  I found Sidda to be the least compelling character in this novel; she was far outweighed by the zany outrageous-ness of her mom and the ya-yas.  But Wells' descriptions of how she finds strength and connectedness in spite of the absurd strait jacket of Southern culture in mid-century is well worth wading through the slow parts.  The things that bothered me the most about this novel were the things that weren't mentioned:  all the other young women in Vivi's community who must have felt hurt and left out by the ya-ya's cliquishness; the black nurse who spends three months at a time away from her children caring for white babies is barely alluded to, while vivi's five month absence from Sidda is the center of the emotional pain in the novel.  You wonder if Wells is aware of these things and chose to leave them out, or if she really just doesn't get it.  But still, there is a lot of healing power in &quot;Divine Secrets&quot; about strong women living in a time and a place where strong women were forced underground.  It's a flawed novel, but well worth reading.	1998-06-08

Their too-predictable plots, stock characters, and particularly the overly explicit sex scenes leave me cold.  Innuendo is far more erotic than anatomically precise detail, imo.  But this one was filed under science fiction/fantasy, so it slipped by my romance censor, and I'm glad it did.  In &quot;Archangel,&quot; the angel Gabriel discovers on the verge of his accession to the position of Archangel that the bride chosen for him by the god is a slave-girl from the wandering, disenfranchised Edori people.  His horror at the unsuitability of the match is exceeded only by his devotion to the commands of the god, so he unwillingly seeks her out.  In Rachel, he meets his match, and the story of their tempestuous marriage and eventual cautious d&eacute;tente is a romance par excellence (minus the explicit sex scenes, thank goodness).  The characters are intelligent turns on the usual romantic cast; the plot is entirely predictable, but so well written that you're glad to go along for the ride; and there is just enough political intrigue, philosophy, and religious debate thrown in to make your mind work a bit.  A perfect vacation read.  My only disappointment is not with the novel itself, but with the sequels, which (according to their annotations at Amazon) pick up quite a bit into the future with a new cast of characters--it would have been nice to know what happened to a number of the characters in &quot;Archangel&quot; (did Maga and Nathan have angel children?  Did Rachel move back to the Eyrie?  How did she solve the problem of wanting to make a difference?  What happened to her school?)	1998-04-14
US	53091678	R27KFHBCYYM52	0553562614	445913	Snow Crash	Books	5	0	0	N	N	read it	The first third of &quot;Snow Crash&quot; is so much fun and so bizarre, I was instantly hooked.  The post-breakdown world he describes is at once surprising and familiar, and--a welcome change from other Bleak Future novels I've read--it is often laugh out loud funny.  But after the initial setup, the book sadly fails to deliver.  The librarian has lots of fascinating ideas, but I hate being on the receiving end of a lecture, and the librarian was a too-thinly disguised device to deliver a too-long lecture.  And the dead-on sendup of contemporary Christians which Stephenson sets up in the first half of the novel starts to sound a little cloying in hindsight:  how can you criticize a group for believing their tenuous interpretations of ancient myths are Truth when you are yourself proposing far more tenuous interpretations of ancient myths as Truth?  Still, the first 150 pages of this novel are SO good, I recommend it highly.  Just check first to see if your library has it before you plunk down your $6.  (shhh, don't tell the amazon folks I said that!)	1998-04-05
US	53091678	RI58J3N6KMB8V	0440222656	691733737	The Horse Whisperer	Books	1	2	2	N	N	re-hash of Bridges of Madison Co	Like Bridges of Madison County, this book features a tall thin middle-aged loner who has never found a woman who could reach into his lonely heart and be his soul-mate (poor thing).  Then when he finally finds her, darn it, she's married to somebody else.  This is a tired plot device and a cop-out on the part of the author.  I'm not too morally superior about affairs (some of my best friends have had affairs...), but when you use adultery as a plot device to supposedly &quot;heal&quot; a hurting family, I for one feel manipulated.<br />But unlike &quot;Bridges,&quot; this novel has an interesting sub-plot about a young girl who loves horses and is nearly killed while riding one.  Too bad that this plot, too, dissolves into syrupy healing schlock in the overly-simplistic handling of her mom's affair.  Like nearly all the other reviewers, I was fascinated by the first 150 pages, but severely disappointed after that.  I don't see how an affair like this one could be appealing, unless you are yourself caught up in a boring marriage and are afraid to either work it out or get out--then I suppose it would provide day-dream material.  But watch out, I think in the long run it has to cause more pain than magical healing.	1998-03-27
US	53091678	ROQV8AA0XGERV	055356921X	698264898	The Strange Files of Fremont Jones: A Fremont Jones Mystery (Fremont Jones Mysteries)	Books	4	2	2	N	N	great airplane reading	Fremont Jones is a refreshingly spirited young woman who becomes involved in solving two mysteries in turn of the century San Francisco.  This book is a lot of fun to read; it's well written with snappy, entertaining dialogue.  I thought it fell apart a bit at the end, though.  And, as might be expected, in trying to include two completely disparate mysteries in one novel, both of them end up getting short-changed.  I wonder why she didn't just make it into two novels--either of them would have been sufficient if she had gone more deeply into the characters involved.  Great read, though--very absorbing, and goes by quickly.	1998-02-25

It is a credit to O'Connell that as a reader I came to care for her in spite of her brittle, prickly nature.  At the end, it was difficult not to rush out and pick up the sequel!  On the downside, though, I found this book to be overpopulated with suspects; (stop reading now if minor spoilers bother you!) even given that it's set in New York, I found it difficult to swallow FOUR murderers in one novel.  Don't let those nits keep you from reading the book, though; it is absorbing and fun, and O'Connell's writing style is interesting and unusual.	1998-01-09
