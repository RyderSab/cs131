Robert Kaplan spent the second half of 2003 touring with special  ops counterinsurgency US military teams in the Philippines and Afghanistan.  Given their under cover  nature,  these special ops interventions are not covered by the press.  Thus, Kaplan brings a huge amount of intelligence and insight on this nearly mysterious subject.<br /><br />The book is fascinating on a couple of levels.  The first one is that the U.S. military contrary to what everyone believes has a rather effective counterinsurgency apparatus.  Since 9/11 we have all read about the ineffectiveness of our lumbering military complex.  Many have recommended the military develops small, flexible teams that could be rapidly deployed where they are needed at a much lower cost than sending aircraft and tank fleets.  But, these experts are recommending something that already exists: our nearly unknown counterinsurgency teams.  And, these teams will play an increasingly important role in fighting the Islamic insurrection and terrorism.<br /><br />The second insight that is most interesting is the strange profile of the men who staff these teams.  They look like buffed up thugs.  But, they are well educated with college and occasional masters degrees in engineering, linguistic, and political science.  They are anti-establishment and love their independence from the Pentagon bureaucracy.  They have beards, and do not wear soldier's helmets, but caps instead.  They feel the helmets don't protect them anyway,  so they would rather be comfortable.  Finally, they are Christians.  They explain their maverick profile by stating that in general the more educated the more risk averse one becomes.  This is unless one has religion.  Their religion allows them to have a sense of mission greater than themselves and to take on risk that secular people would not take.  Finally the beard thing is to fit in with the local Muslim population.  This is because their goal is to befriend the local population, assist them in building infrastructure including schools and hospitals.  And, by doing so attempt to isolate the violent fundamentalist elements.<br /><br />Not all is perfect with these teams.  Kaplan mentions they suffer from lack of linguistic skills that hinders their integration with locals.  That's not a surprise.  Pashto, Persian and Arabic dialects are not readily taught in the U.S.  Nevertheless,  after reading this book you feel that the political return on investment on these special ops is far greater than in investing in more tanks.<br /><br />If you liked this book, I also recommend Robert Kaplan's \\"The Coming Anarchy,\\" Thomas X. Hammes's \\"The Sling and the Stone,\\" and van Crevald's \\"The Transformation of War.\\" All these books focus on the changing nature of military conflict in the 21st century.  Of the three books, van Crevald's is especially prescient as it was written nearly a decade before 9/11.  While the others were written after.st them in building infrastructure including schools and hospitals.

This is an excellent book on several counts.  First, besides revisionist historians it is not known that Lincoln was a lifelong depressive.  Second, the author advances that Lincoln's depression was more a source of insight than a mental flaw.  In other words, Lincoln's character and intelligence seemed greater because of his depression it.  That's a pretty radical concept in our modern \\"Prozac Nation\\" when depression at any level is considered a serious mental illness that should be eradicated at all costs.<br /><br />Lincoln lived in an era way before anti-depressants.  But, just like John Nash of \\"A Beautiful Mind\\" fame who preserved his cognitive capabilities by not taking the drugs he was prescribed, Lincoln had no choice but to do without.  And, according to the author the history of our Nation has been so much the better for it.<br /><br />The author describes how Lincoln through the ages managed his depression through several different stages, including: Fear, Engagement, Transcendence, Creativity, and Humility.  While the first stage [Fear] had a familiar and serious clinical component including recurring suicidal thoughts, the other four stages lead Lincoln to greater self-actualization, philosophical insights, spirituality, and commitment to guide and save our Nation.<br /><br />The message from this original biography is powerful.  By accepting one's humanity, we can actually grow.  Some serious introspection even if painful is actually good for you.  There is no need to medicate all your blues away.  You may actually learn and grow for them.  And, what Lincoln dealt with was not just the occasional blues.  As depicted by the author, based on thorough historical research, he had a very serious case of depression.  There is little doubt that nowadays he would be treated with anti-depressants.  But, his life's achievements clearly question whether our modern psychiatric-pharmaceutical treatment is the best course.<br /><br />In our contemporary culture it is a prerequisite to be an optimist and deliver the most upbeat message to be electable.  But, is this the best way to choose a President?  The author suggests otherwise.  Referring to historians' researches, he mentions that many of our greatest minds were afflicted by more than a temporal case of the blues.  Charles Darwin being a case in point.  The author also mentions psychological research on perception of reality between optimists and others (slightly depressed or pessimists).  Invariably, the optimists tested poorly with a more delusional perception of reality than the others less upbeat individuals.<br /><br />If you like this book, I also strongly recommend Sylvia Nazar's \\"A Beautiful Mind\\" that depicts another luminary struggle with powerful mental illness.  Also, \\"Howard Hughes: His Life and Madness\\" by Donald Barlett is an excellent biography.  While Lincoln clearly overcame his depression without psychiatric assistance; the case of John Nash is more ambivalent.  Did his psychiatric care help or hurt him?  Meanwhile, Hughes clearly needed psychiatric help.  But, he autocratically avoided it.  As a result, he died prematurely an insane and debilitated man.  In any case, all three subjects make for fascinating biographies.  And, the mentioned authors succeeded brilliantly in their respective challenging tasks.ulture it is a prerequisite to be an optimist and deliver the most upbeat message to be electable.

This is an excellent book about the discovery of the Kelly formula that is unknown outside gambling.  This story has three protagonists.  Two of them were scientists working at Bell Labs: Claude Shannon, a genius polymath who developed information theory; and John Kelly, a maverick genius, who is directly responsible for the development of Kelly's formula.  The third one is a brilliant MIT mathematician, Ed Thorp.<br /><br />Ed Thorp tested the Kelly formula in both gambling and investing.  Also, he came up with an options formula before Fischer Black and Myron Scholes.  His formula missed a risk-free rate component due to the structure of the market at the time.  As a result, Ed Thorp remained in obscurity while Black and Scholes became famous.<br /><br />Ed Thorp succeeded in deriving superior returns in both gambling and investing.  But, it was not so much because of Kelly's formula.  He developed other tools to achieve superior returns.  In gambling, Ed Thorp succeeded at Black Jack by developing the card counting method.  He just used intuitively Kelly's formula to increase his bets whenever the odds were in his favor.  Later, he ran a hedge fund for 20 years until the late 80s and earned a rate of return of 14% handily beating the market's 8% during the period.  Also, his hedge fund hardly lost any value on black Monday in October 1987, when the market crashed by 22%.  The volatility of his returns was far lower than the market.  He did this by exploiting market inefficiencies using warrants, options, and convertible bonds.  The Kelly formula was for him a risk management discipline and not a direct source of excess return.<br /><br />Ed Thorp's career as a hedge fund manager was temporarily cut short.  This was due to his fund being involved in a tax-avoiding securities scheme with Drexel Burnham.  Thorp was not guilty; but, the fund had to be liquidated.  The author stated many of Milken wrongdoings.  One included getting large equity positions attached to the junk bonds he issued.  The companies thought they were issuing convertible bonds.  However, the equity component went straight into Milken's pocket as he sold the bonds to investors as high yield debt with no equity attached.<br /><br />Ed Thorp rebounded from this mishap and started a second hedge fund in 1994.  Thorp continued reaping above market return.  As the author states, Ed Thorp's genius consists in \\"...his continuous ability to discover new market inefficiencies ... as old ones played out.\\"  Ed Thorp closed this second fund in 2002.  He is now independently exploring inefficiencies in gambling.<br /><br />Claude Shannon amassed large wealth by recording one of the best investment records.  His performance had little to do with Kelly's formula.  Between 1966 and 1986, his record beat even Warren Buffet (28% to 27% respectively).  Shannon strategy was similar to Buffet.  Both their stock portfolios were concentrated, and held for the long term.  Shannon achieved his record by holding mainly three stocks (Teledyne, Motorola, and HP).  The difference between the two was that Shannon invested in technology because he understood it well, while Buffet did not.<br /><br />John Kelly was a chain smoking, gun collecting brilliant physicist.  He died young at 41 of an aneurysm.  He worked closely with Shannon at Bell Labs.  Besides being a charismatic character the author does not write much about his life compared to the other two (Shannon and Thorp).<br /><br />The Kelly formula is Edge/Odds (as explained on page 72).  In investment circles, this formula is not always useful because it is hard to quantify your Edge (value of proprietary information).  However, Kelly's formula has intuitive practical implications.  It entails you should focus on an investment internal rate of return (IRR) instead of its average yearly return.  The IRR is always less.  Another implication is that higher risk is not always compensated by higher return.  There is an optimal risk level beyond which risk taking becomes destructive.  The author mentions the Long Term Capital Management as a case in point.<br /><br />I recommend other excellent similar books: \\"Fischer Black and the Revolutionary Idea of Finance\\" by Perry Mehrling, and \\"When Genius Failed.  The Rise and Fall of Long Term Capital Management\\" by Roger Lowenstein.  Both these books describe luminaries in  finance and investment fields who were often in contact with Ed Thorp and Claude Shannon.

With this book Jon Krakauer  has proven he is more than just a great \\"Outdoors\\" writer.  He is a world-class nonfiction writer.  His penmanship, investigative skills,  and insightful judgment  are second to none.<br /><br />This book has gotten the greatest number of Amazon reader reviews I have ever  seen.  Close to 90% of reviewers give him a 5 rating.  The other 10% (Mormons) give him a 1 rating accusing him of defaming the Mormon Church.<br /><br />The Mormons have an interesting argument.  They differentiate between the mainstream Church of Latter Day Saints (LDS) and Fundamentalists Church of Latter Day Saints (FLDS).  The LDS are part of the mainstream of American society.  The FLDS are not.  The latter live in isolated communities in the Far West and Canada.  They practice polygamy,  chattel of women, [...], and [...].  Young girls are taken out of schools in their early teens  and forced to marry older men.  The FLDS are responsible for all the negative headlines in the press, including kidnapping and rape of girls and religious murders.  Thus,  the LDS accuse Krakauer  of associating and confusing them with FLDS.<br /><br />The issue is complex.  The FLDS and the LDS share the same heritage (prophet: Joseph Smith; scripture:  Book of Mormons).  The FLDS argue they are the true upholders of the Mormon Church,  as their practices follow more closely the ones of Joseph Smith.  The FLDS argue that the LDS are traitors who did not follow the Mormon scriptures, including the ordained duty of polygamy.  They feel the LDS compromised the beliefs and practices of the Mormon Church simply to harmonize  their  relationship with Federal authorities.<br /><br />History and religion often clash.  Believers  rarely take well to the documented history of their own.  This is because  the history of prophets and saints are just histories of human  beings with their many flaws.  With the old religions,  the history is not well documented and shrouded in myth and mystery that protects the supposedly divine nature of their prophets.  Not so for the Mormons, this is a very modern religion.  As a result the humanity of Joseph Smith is well known.  From that standpoint,  the Mormons are at a disadvantage vs  the Christians, Jews, and Muslims.  They can't hide behind much mysteries.<br /><br />Joseph Smith did behave more like a FLDS than a LDS.  Krakauer's study of Joseph Smith's life is well  documented.  Joseph Smith had over 40 wives many were coerced teenagers.  His wives had no individual rights.  Their main purpose was to procreate.<br /><br />The chapters go back and forth between the history of Joseph Smith and the Mormon Church,  and an investigative reportage of  how the Lafferty family progressively imploded leading to religious murders of one of the brother's wife and child by another  brother.  For the reader it is easy to interpret that the religion of Joseph Smith and the fanaticism of the Lafferty brothers is one and the same.  The LDS readers state this amount  to defamation against  the Mormon Church.<br /><br />Maybe the LDS will one day successfully distance  themselves from the FLDS.  To do so, they may have to follow another  prophet  than  Joseph Smith, and another  book than the Book of Mormons.  The fourth prophet, Wilford Woodruff and his revelation \\"The Manifesto\\" come to mind.  He is the first prophet who  renounced polygamy,  and accepted the law of the land.  But as long as the LDS continue revering Joseph Smith,  they will continue being associated with the FLDS.<br /><br />Even within the mainstream LDS history there is much violence.  This includes the well documented history of \\"The Mountain Meadows Massacre\\" and many other  bloodsheds during the 19th Century involving the Mormons using Indians  as scapegoats for the murders they  committed.<br /><br />The 23d chapter  \\"Judgment in Provo\\" reads like an intense legal thriller.  At the trial of Ron Lafferty, Dr. Gardner testifying for the prosecution  brilliantly differentiates between religious zealotry and mental illness.  His sound logic prevailed  over the psychiatric experts working for the defense who maintained that  Ron Lafferty was crazy and not competent for trial.<br /><br />The book is painful to read for Mormons.  For others it is fascinating.  It uncovers  a history of an intriguing religious World.  You would not expect FLDS communities to thrive in the 21st century in America.  But, they do.<br /><br />If you enjoyed this book,  I recommend the other books by Jon Krakauer \\"Into Thin Air\\" and \\"Into the Wild.\\"  Those two books are quick page turners.  Regarding religion, the most interesting book I have read recently is Philip Jenkins \\"The Next Christendom.\\"  It describes  how Christianity is changing in a most unexpected direction not  influenced by the West, but instead mainly by Africa and South America.ental illness.

The author's investigative methodology is impeccable.  In each chapter, the author proficiently combines a historical background related to the issue with his own firsthand experience based on having lived on each of the many campuses he investigated.  Additionally, he refers to related studies with extensive endnotes.<br /><br />Each chapter is self-contained focused on specific subjects such as Dormitories, Mating, Studying, Emotional troubles, Alcohol, Fraternities, Drugs, etc...  These read like stand-alone reports.  You don't have to read the book in a chronological order but can jump right to the subject that interest you.<br /><br />After reading this book you will conclude that the college scene has radically changed since the 60s.  And, unfortunately it is not for the better.  That's despite his focusing mainly on elite colleges.  The coed bathroom with little privacy is just the beginning.<br /><br />Drinking has become often lethal.  Beer is out.  Hard liquor is in, often mixed with anti-depressants and other prescription or illegal drugs.  Deaths from lethal alcohol intoxication happen far more often.  It was pretty difficult killing oneself with beer.  It is not when mixing prescription drugs and vodka.  Women are sadly more vulnerable to becoming such casualties because they now drink as hard as men not accounting for their much less alcohol tolerant constitution.<br /><br />Why do women drink like men?  It's about mating.  Dating is out.  Hooking up is in.  Mating has become an anonymous transaction.  Women in groups get drunk in the strategic presence of drunken men.  Nature runs its course.  The next day brains are fried.  Emotions are numb.  The author calls it the equality of the sexes.  Behavior of males and females are not differentiable anymore.<br /><br />The drug scene is mixed.  Cocaine, heroin, and Ecstasy are fading.  Students have recognized they may do permanent brain damage.  But, marijuana is everywhere.  The reason is that students understand that marijuana is much less dangerous than Vodka mixed with Paxil.  However, the potency of marijuana today is two to ten times stronger than in the sixties.  And, that is a concern in increasing the risk of both lung cancer and impairment of neurotransmitters.<br /><br />Studying seems definitely out.  The start of the weekend is officially Thursday night with no Friday classes.  At these elite colleges, most students are super smart and have figured how to game the system by doing the minimal.  If they do close to nothing, they get Bs.  If they work like maniacs, they get As.  Most opt for the B route.<br /><br />Grade inflation reinforces intellectual laziness.  Professors get offended by this concept, and prefer the concept of grade compression.  The A to F scale has essentially been replaced by the A to B- one, hence the compression and the weakening studying ethic.<br /><br />Fraternities are dying.  Because of the abusive behaviors of brothers, including drunkenness, loudness, vandalism, date rape, and sexual harassments many of the frats are in a loosing battle over increasingly frat-hostile campus policies.<br /><br />Chapter 11, \\"What's the Right Drinking Age?\\" is excellent.  It concludes with the perplexing fact that McGill, the leading large Canadian university had a far lower rate of alcohol related hospitalization than Dartmouth.  And, that's despite the fact that the drinking age is only 18 in Canada vs. 21 in the U.S.  What gives?<br /><br />The last chapter is interesting, as it questions the mission of colleges.  In yesteryears \\"higher learning\\" was the goal.  Today, it is codling and treating young adults as kids rather than adults in part to prevent lawsuit liabilities.  The chapter also studies the change in expectations of college students.  Idealism is out.  Financial security is in.  This is the flip side of the 60s values.  The author addresses the efforts that elite schools have taken to improve the experience of college education.Much has to do with housing professors within or nearby students' residence halls to strengthen rapport with students.  Many professors resist the changes and prefer their quiet lifestyle.  After reading this book, you can understand them.<br /><br />If you are interested in this subject, I strongly recommend \\"Inside the Top Colleges\\" by Howard and Mathew Greene.  It is another fascinating reality check on the elite colleges.he experience of college education.  Much has to do with housing professors within or nearby students' residence halls to strengthen rapport with students.  Many professors resist the changes and prefer their quiet lifestyle.

This is a very well written short book on the excessive use of cancer testing.  The book is divided in two parts.  The first part explains the problems associated with the inaccuracy of cancer screening and its implications: painful over treatment including surgery.  The second part educates one on how to interpret cancer statistics so as not to be vulnerable to the positive media spin.  It also educates as to the limit of research findings.  The benefits of cancer screening are often statistically unfounded.  This part also educates on how to manage your doctor so you don't get over tested.<br /><br />If you combine the most technology and profit driven medical establishment with the most litigious society, you get a Perfect Storm for excessive cancer testing.  That is what we got in the U.S.  No doctor will ever get sued because he ordered a cancer test.  But, he will if his patients get cancer, and he had not actively recommended a test.  As a result, doctors don't take any chances and they scear us in taking many cancer screening test.<br /><br />Cancer tests are deemed to be good for us.  Supposedly, the earlier you catch cancer the greater the survival rate.  Per the author that is nothing but a simple statistical flaw.  We are now tested earlier, and our cancers are detected many years earlier.  If you test a population of  50 year olds for prostate cancer, you get a higher survival rate at 5 years, then if you test a population of 70 year olds.  Thus, the increase in 5 year survival rate means nothing.  The author further adds that mortality rates (of cancer or other causes) has really not changed whether you get tested for cancer or not.  Thus, PSA tests and mammograms really don't save lives.  Also, cancer incidence has risen to supposedly epidemic levels.  But, again this is just due to increase testing.<br /><br />The standard path is to first take a really benign test whose result is more often than not inconclusive (radiologists often disagree).  This leads to biopsies that often are inconclusive (pathologists often disagree too).  But to remove the uncertainty, radical surgeries are often the next step.  The intervention escalated from one level to the next in part because of the perceived threat of malpractice suit.<br /><br />The author advances an excellent argument that the healthy would be better off without that much cancer screening.  A lot of cancers that are now uncovered such as prostate cancers are benign and would not affect health or lifespan.  Many more men die with prostate cancer than from prostate cancer.  He calls those benign cancers a \\"cancer reservoir.\\"  The increasing sensitivity of tests uncovers more and more benign growth from our cancer reservoir.  And, that really does not do anyone healthy any good.  It leads to overly aggressive painful over treatment.  At this pace, the entire male American population will have their prostate removed without gaining a day in lifespan, but with a marked increase in incontinence and impotence.  This paragraph could be rewritten very much the same way for women regarding ductal carcinoma in situ, a most common but benign form of breast cancer (DCIS).  These certainly don't warrant breast removal, but that's often what doctors do.<br /><br />To become a well educated customer of medical services, I also strongly recommend two other excellent books.  One is \\"The Last Well Person\\" by Nortin Hadler.  This book extends the critique of the medical establishment not just to cancer screening, but to the treatment of cardiovascular disease, and everything else.  The other is \\"Calculated Risks: How to know when numbers deceive you\\" by Gerd Gigerenzer.  This book explains in detail the logic and implication of Baye's Theorem.  By doing so, it explains why PSA tests and mammograms are so inaccurate.ree).  This leads to biopsies that often are inconclusive (pathologists often disagree too).

This is an outstanding book about a finance revolutionary.  This biography is as interesting as Sylvia Nazar \\"A Beautiful Mind\\" about John Nash, the pioneer of Game Theory.<br /><br />Fischer Black, the human being was as interesting as Nash.  As a young man, he was quite the adventurer and engaged in casual sex and taking LSD.  But, after suffering a failed marriage and the death of a close friend he recognized the risk of those activities.  Thus, he started to live by the CAPM motto to manage the risk in his own life.  He drove safe cars, wearing seatbelts before it was mandatory and adhering to a strict diet (fish and vegetables).  He married another two times to finally get it right.  During his second marriage, when it was not working out, he would seek female companions by posting personal ads in the local paper.  And, he would encourage his wife to do the same!  Later, he met his third wife through a dating service.<br /><br />Fischer Black became famous for what he cared less about: the Black Scholes option model.  Options were just a passing interest.  He cared more about CAPM developed by Jack Traynor.  His lifelong ambition was to apply CAPM to economics.<br /><br />He failed to leave a legacy in economics.  Perry Mehrling explains why.  Fischer Black had degrees in physics and mathematics but no formal training in economics.  His General Equilibrium theory clashed with both Keynesians and monetarists.  While at Chicago, his General Equilibrium theory got no respect from Milton Friedman, the leading monetarist.  Later, Paul Samuelson, the leading Keynesian at MIT, treated him just as badly.  He could not get his economics papers published.  In academia he became recognized as cutting edge in finance, but out of his depth in economics.<br /><br />Fischer was very much egoless.  He took all the rebuttals from economics luminaries in stride.  They never discouraged him to pursue his economics research.  Also, he quickly adopted the binomial tree option model developed in 1976 by Cox-Ross-Rubinstein.  He viewed it as faster and more flexible than his own Black Scholes model.  Other common mortals would have hung on proudly to their own model.  Not Fischer Black!<br /><br />Before Fischer Black finance was a minor discipline to economics.  After Fischer Black, the reverse is truer.  Even though he was the original quant on Wall Street, he really did not think like one.<br /><br />Fischer Black thought like no one else.  While his MIT colleagues would attack problems head on with formulas and models, Fischer Black would not.  He would explore a problem from as many different angles as he could think.  Once he had essentially solved the problem conceptually in his head he would finally generate the formula.  The formula was just the concrete representation of his solution.  If you developed a formula first and a solution second, as his MIT colleagues did, you would get stuck in a thinking rut dictated by your formula.<br /><br />His teaching methods were bizarre.  He got bored teaching already acquired knowledge.  Thus, he felt regular lectures were a waste of time.  It would be better for students to spend the time studying the textbook directly.  However, he developed a teaching style he and his students found engaging.  He came up with a list of 50 questions explorative in nature.  This helped him pick ideas from brilliant young minds.  His students loved it, because it turned the class into a vibrant seminar.<br /><br />Fischer Black pioneered many concepts that resulted in new financial markets.  In 1969, as a consultant for Wells Fargo with Myron Scholes, they propose three passive investment strategies never thought of before.  One was the equivalent of an index fund and another a hedge fund.  As a result of this work, Wells Fargo introduced the first S&P 500 index fund to institutional investors in 1973.  And, John Boggle of Vanguard did the same for retail investors in 1976.  His work on options in the late 60s lead to the opening of the Chicago Board Options Exchange in 1973.  His work on valuing futures in 1976, lead to the Merc introducing such contracts on the S&P 500 in 1983.  Later, when working for Goldman Fischer developed the first computer trading system.  There, he also co-developed the Black-Derman-Toy model to value any fixed income derivative product.  Thereafter, the entire derivative market really took off.<br /><br />If you like this book, you will like Roger Lowenstein \\"When Genius Failed.  The Rise and Fall of Long Term Capital Management.\\"  It describes the fascinating tragedy of how Fischer Black colleagues Myron Scholes and Robert Merton tarnished their reputation by co-founding a hedge fund that needed to be bailed out.  Fischer Black was prescient in figuring out they were loading on risk (time dimension) and turned down the offer to join LTCM.  Thus, Fischer Black legend goes on.ptions in the late 60s lead to the opening of the Chicago Board Options Exchange in 1973.

This is an outstanding book that decries many components of traditional and alternative medicine.  It is very informative to manage your own health in a more independent, cost-effective, and dignified way than otherwise.  According to the author all our ills that truly result mainly from the natural process of aging have been \\"medicalized\\" at no benefit to the patient.  But in turn, this medicalization has generated huge profits for the health care industries.<br /><br />The author has impressive credentials to advance his views.  He is a professor of Medicine at one of the top U.S. public universities, and he is a practicing rheumatologist.  Additionally, he has a strong background in statistics that he uses to interpret the objective results of random trials before spin doctors promote questionable benefit of whatever drug tested.  Also, his \\"opinions' are well supported by 60 pages of references to random trials mentioned in the \\"Annoted Readings\\" section of the book.<br /><br />Human beings have a mean expected life span of 85 years.  Advances in medical technology has done nothing to extend this life span.  With aging, a bunch of proximate diseases (cardiovascular, cancers, and others) compete with each other to end our days.  Thus, often the well publicized reduction in mortality for a certain type of cancer due to a treatment has no implication in extending one's life span for a single day.  A survivor of prostate cancer may die at the exact same time he would have died of cancer but from cardiovascular disease.  The author has analyzed many related random trials that confirmed this.<br /><br />\\"Medicalization\\" is in his view an artificial social construct whereby a condition (back or knee pain) has been turned into a disease.  It results in Type II malpractice whereby patients that are well have incurred treatments (sometimes invasive and dangerous) that were not necessary.<br /><br />The benefit from breast and prostate cancer screening is highly questionable.  Both mammography and the PSA tests generate so many false positive as to render the tests useless.  The ensuing investigation, treatment, and surgeries from incurring a positive test are often painful, dangerous, and offer no proven benefits of any reduction in mortality rate.<br /><br />He feels just the same way about bypass surgery that provides no benefit and is associated with a high risk of death as a result of the operation (2% to 8%) or depression (50%).  It helps only 3% of the coronary patient who do have extensive plaque blockage in their left-main artery.  For the other 97% of patients, bypass surgery represents an unfavorable risk/benefit trade off.<br /><br />Alternative medicine is not spared either.  He sees no benefit in most herbal, vitamins and mineral supplements.  Chiropractic, homeopathy, and other alternatives do not seem more credible than traditional medicine.  Again, the above is supported by reference to random trials and studies.<br /><br />In his view, being a well person is coping well with the acceptable and natural imperfection of health as we age.  This is a better alternative than to render ourselves patient of a medical establishment who will diagnose, test, and operate us at great profits for themselves but significant suffering to ourselves without adding a day to our life span, and often compromising our quality of life in the mean time.le.

This book is excellent, as it delivers exactly what its title suggests.  The book is expensive, as it is priced as a textbook.  However, after reading it I feel it provides an excellent value.  And, I will keep it in my personal library of quantitative books.  Although the book is short, it is so hard packed with information that it takes a while to digest.  Confirming the intensity of the information conveyed Amazon stats discloses that its Fog Index is 14.7 (years of formal education suggested to understand the book) and its Flesch-Kincaid Index is 11.5 (corresponding to the reading grade level).  Those metrics are relatively high.  However, the book is very rewarding if you want to learn the subject and manage your own capital in a better informed manner.<br /><br />The book is divided into two main sections.  The first section comprised of 10 chapters makes for an excellent foundation in macroeconomics, international economics, monetary and fiscal policies.  The author always makes the topic relevant from an investor's standpoint.  Thus, he presents the material in a practical way.  Some of the subsections are particularly interesting including explanation of the implication of different yield curve shapes, the sustainability of current account deficits and fiscal budget deficits, the differentiation between the cyclical and structural components of the U.S. budget deficit, the detailed analysis of various emerging markets crisis (Asia, Russia, Brazil, and Argentina) during the nineties.  In each cases, the author demonstrates an outstanding knowledge of the historical events and the underlying economic factors.<br /><br />The second section includes 7 chapters covering each a specific investment (stocks, bonds, real estate, etc...). He explains how an investment is valued, what are the main drivers affecting its value, and how economic indicators and factors affect the value and attractiveness of that given investment. The author does a very good job of disaggregating the different components of economic return associated with each investment.  By reading this section, you will learn in great detail how to value stocks, bonds, real estate and other assets.<br /><br />The author also wrote a short third section that serves as a summary, synthesis, and conclusion.  Within this section, he compares how all the different asset classes respond to various economic events.  He also builds a rational expectation of real returns for stocks, bonds, and real estate going forward.  He also outlines the many different investment styles of the investment pros and the challenges that each investment style faces.  Overall, I strongly recommend the book.disaggregating the different components of economic return associated with each investment.

She is also the author of the excellent college guide \\"A is for Admission.\\"  This book is one of the best among the 10 ones I have read.  \\"Acing the College Application\\" is not as rich in insights and information as \\"A is for Admission.\\"  This is because it is focused on a more mechanical and narrow topic (how to best fill the actual application so as to maximize your chances).<br /><br />Nevertheless, I still give this book a strong 5.  This is because Hernandez advice on many of the details of filling application is so valuable.  There are tons of strategic mistakes one is bound to do just out of ignorance.  She gives you the inside scoop on how admission officers read, interpret, and assess the data and qualitative information you provide them.  Without understanding somewhat how their brains work, you have little chance of getting in top college regardless of your academic record.<br /><br />The first half of the book is mainly dedicated to the various essays you have to write to complete an application.  Thus, this book doubles up as an excellent college essay guide. She teaches you everything you need to know to be successful on that one count.<br /><br />Near the end, she covers broader topics in several very interesting chapters, including: what to do if you are deferred or wait listed, early action vs early decision, and weighing your options once you are accepted.  Unlike many of her counterparts, Michele Hernandez gives you many other valuable strategic details unencumbered by political correctness.  She gets so many things rights that others either miss or get wrong.  Regarding early action or decision, she has actually looked at the acceptance rate data and she strongly recommends you use these tools to your advantage to get into a most selective schools.  If you don't you are not serious about getting in Princeton, Stanford, and similar schools.  Regarding the wait list thing, make sure you find out why you were wait listed.  If they say it is because the pool of applicants was unusually competitive; you may as well move on.  You are toast.  But, if they say it is because they are missing something in your application, you are still right in there.  And, you have a good chance of impressing the admission officer with strong follow up.  That is a valuable piece of information I had never read anywhere [find out why you are wait listed and respond accordingly].<br /><br />Overall, I strongly recommend this book.  Obviously, you should read it after reading \\"A is for Admission\\" to establish a broad based foundation in the college application and selection process.  Another top-notch book I strongly recommend is \\"The Early Admission Game.\\"  The coauthors have studied the acceptance data and have measured with the greatest accuracy the advantage in using early action/decision program vs going the regular admission channel.t list thing, make sure you find out why you were wait listed.

It provides you all the information you need to succeed. It gives you strategies that take advantage of the test structure. It also shows you how to best manage your time.  The book gives you enough material in the Math glossary and 100 Key Math Concepts to quickly teach yourself the math you need so you will test well.<br /><br />The book provides two full-length ACT practice exams. Additionally, it gives you free access to many more online tests at Kaplan's website.  Anyone who has the discipline to read and study a good part of this book (including the math sections) and do at least one of the book's practice exams is bound to do a lot better on the ACT then if they had not prepared for this exam.  Overall, I think the ACT is less studied and coached than the SAT.  This represents an opportunity for the ACT test takers who do get prepared by buying this book.	2005-07-11

This book probably works just as well for an introduction to Excel for the ones who have no experience with this program.  Given that I have extensive experience with Excel, my review focuses on this guide's ability to transfer your Excel skills from the Wintel to the Mac OS environment.<br /><br />This guide does a very good job of transferring the skills you have acquired in Excel/Wintel to Excel/Mac OS in the minimum of time.  The format of the book is even superior to the Dummies series (my favorite until now).  This is because each page is smartly divided between a relevant simple list of action steps to take to achieve a specific function.  And, the other half of the page shows actual pictures of what the screen will look like.  So, the emphasis on actual visuals is second to none (it is ahead of the Dummies series on that count).<br /><br />It is the simplest stuff who will baffle you at first.  The more advanced features of Excel are common whether you work on the Mac or the Wintel platform.  But, what is unsettling is that the simplest features are different.  When you first work with Excel for Mac, just the simple viewing and editing of cells is different.  It leads one to believe that Excel for Mac and Wintel are really incompatible.  They are actually very compatible.  But, you just have to understand how the Mac environment works.  It is a little bit different.  Once you get the hang of it, it's a cruise.<br /><br />After studying this guide, you will quickly realize that Excel for Mac is just as flexible and powerful an analytical tool as Excel/Wintel.  It even has some advantages.  The Clipboard is more visible and useful.  The Calculator feature gives you more space and control when developing complex formulas.  The List function offers more robust database capabilities than the traditional Excel.  It integrates Access capabilities into Excel.  The graph function has several additional 3-D capabilities.  Thus, overall I strongly recommend this book, that will quickly teach you Excel for the Mac.this book, that will quickly teach you Excel for the Mac.	2005-07-11
US	52977415	R2X3ONYNMZK1XG	1573226521	117734468	The Beach	Books	5	20	24	N	Y	Great book, but great movie too!	I first saw the movie on DVD a couple of weeks ago.  I found the movie extraordinary.  It was so beautiful, mesmerizing, and intense.  The plot, the casting, the acting, the scenery, the photography it all worked together seamlessly.  After reading everyone's reviews I just had to read the book.  You know the clich&eacute;: \\"If you liked the movie, you will love the book, it's so much better.\\"  Well, not necessarily in this specific case they are both excellent.  If anything, relative to their own medium the movie is a better movie than the book is for a book.  This does not mean the book is bad.  It is still outstanding.<br /><br />The book was great fun to read, and is an incredible page turner.  Actually, never reading fiction I am typically an incredibly slow reader (typically 35 pages an hour).  But, in this case I found myself cruising effortlessly at speeds close to or over 60 pages an hour.  And, I read the whole book (400 pages) in less than 3 full days, and that was during the working week.  That's definitely a personal best for me in terms of speed and pretty close to a best in terms of enjoyment too.<br /><br />The book has a fairly universal appeal.  I frankly don't have that much interest or respect in the type of dope addicted, hedonistic, vapid and meaningless culture described in the book.  Yet, somehow I could relate very much to the characters.  The plot was a complex mix of Robinson Crusoe, Lord of the Flies, Apocalypse Now, and the Drifters (by James Michener).  It was the group dynamics, the power plays, the politics, and the hardship that made this story so interesting.  The protagonists faced wrenching moral dilemma days after days.  They are put in situations where they are no clear cut good or bad answers.  Sometimes given the circumstances, the apparently cruel thing is the right thing to do.  Most of the characters had few redeeming qualities by themselves, but as a society they became fascinating.  They became a representative microcosm of the entire of humankind.<br /><br />The writing is so hip, that at first it is almost irritating.  How many times can you read the four letter word in the same paragraph.  For a while, you almost question whether people really do speak like that.  But, the genius in the writing was that it was made to be adapted into a screenplay.  Voluntarily or not, Alex Garland created a magical cash machine when he wrote this first novel.  Twentieth Century Fox must have gone bezerk when they came across his story.  After this book, Garland did not rest on his laurels as he soon wrote \\"28 Days Later\\" which was turned into one of the best Armageddon horror movies I have seen in the past few years.<br /><br />As you can tell, I can unequivocally recommend the book and the movie as well.  Reading this book tempts me to read again both Robinson Crusoe and The Drifters.cosm of the entire of humankind.   <br /> <br />The writing is so hip, that at first it is almost irritating.

The depth of the sociological analysis of the Open era is unprecedented.  The strength of this book is due to Bodo's back and forth dual approach.  In one chapter, he will paint a broad and often scathing analytical brush on one aspect of the Open era.  He may even focus on the change in character of one Gran Slam tournament (Wimbledon, U.S. Open).  But, the very next chapter he will likely focus on one single star and essentially write a biography about them based on his multitude of interviews he had with most of them.<br /><br />Prior to the Open era, Bodo explains how tennis stood for sportsmanship, ethics, and educated well-rounded personalities catering to a sophisticated public.  As a case in point, he mentions the many members of the Australian dynasty in the 50s, 60s, and early 70s who were all models of sportsmanship, and humility.  They also did well in their tennis after life.  These included legendary names like Laver, Rosewall, Emerson, and Newcomb among many others.  On the American side, you had a series of college-educated players with mature personalities, including Dennis Ralston, Arthur Ashe, Charlie Pasarell, Stan Smith, and Bob Lutz.  Some of them crossed over the Open era.  But, they came from an old guard when tennis and its stars stood for something different than after the Open era.<br /><br />The Open era officially started in 1968.  But, per Bodo it kicked into gear in 1976 with the advent of Bjorn Borg, and Connors.  All of a sudden, the game became corrupted by relentless commercialization.  The money got so huge that it killed sportsmanship, humility, education, and well roundedness.  The college game disappeared.  If you are good enough for the pros at 18, forget college.  All of a sudden tennis is manufactured as a sensational show that is becoming more like pro mud wrestling than gentlemanly tennis.  The stars have become self-adulating, spoiled, uneducated, neurotic, unbalanced millionaire teenagers who will do anything to win a match.  Their conduct is symmetrically opposite to the Australian heroes of yesteryears (Laver, Newcomb, etc...).  But, the new stars are considered \\"colorful\\" and good for Nielsen ratings.  The better-adjusted old guard sportsmanship is considered dull and unmarketable.  Pete Sampras is a case in point.  He was one of the greatest players of all times.  He was also among the very few and ultimate sportsman in his era.  But, instead of being adulated and emulated he was criticized by the public and ignored by the sponsors as being too dull.<br /><br />What is really interesting about the mini biographies Bodo writes about the super stars is how unexpected they are.  Often, the villains come across so much better once you get to know them better.  Connors, Lendl, McEnroe, and Seles all come across as much more balanced, and more interesting than you would expect.  They seem much more likeable than their on court persona.  Some of their rivalries also make for a fascinating read.  On the other hand, everyone's good guy Borg is a pathological Greek tragedy.  Of course Borg was an incredible sportsman much like the Australians were.  But, he was a monolithic truly dysfunctional character who could not see his place anywhere in the world outside of being number one.  Out of all former champions, retirement has been most cruel to Borg because he had nothing to fall back on.  He had no side interest, and no life to speak off outside tennis.  He made an embarrassing attempt to return to tennis playing with wood racquets in an era of carbon graphite and Teflon.  He failed miserably loosing to journeymen.<br /><br />Bodo's book stops in the early 90s.  He acknowledges at the end of the book that the Open era seemed to have turned the corner with a more sportsmanlike young emerging generation of American champions (Chang, Courier, Agassi, and Sampras).  The great generation of emerging champions Bodo mentioned all have retired (except forAgassi, and as of this writing he may be months from doing so).  They have been replaced by a group of interesting foreigners who may prove ultimately better for the game as the talent is more diversified.<br /><br />Bodo's book even outclasses a series of excellent books on the same subject, including: \\"Bad News for McEnroe\\" by Bill Scanlon, and \\"Tennis Confidential\\" by Paul Fein.  \\"You Can't Be Serious\\" by John McEnroe is in a lesser league because as one can expect it is so much more self-centered than the others.  Yet, it is still an excellent and very entertaining book.  This tells you how much I have appreciated all these books, and Bodo's above all.etired (except for Agassi, and as of this writing he may be months from doing so).

He will be wrong about China too.	Back in 1988, Prestowitz wrote \\"Trading Places\\" which was about Japan taking over the world.  It sure looked that way at the time, Japan had the highest savings and investment rate, it was catching up and leapfrogging past us in many technologies.  It had a huge current account surplus.  However, shortly after Prestowitz published his book Japan experienced a chronic recession for the next 20 years.  It's stock market level has not recovered from the peak of the late 80s.<br /><br />Now, Prestowits is crying wolf about China and India for a different set of well known reasons.  They have an abundant, cheap, and increasingly educated labor force that will accelerate the gutting out of both our manufacturing and research-service sectors.<br /><br />Everything Prestowitz states is true, well researched, and insightful.  Thus, why was he so wrong nearly 20 years ago about the prognostic of Japan vs the U.S.?  And, is he likely to be wrong about China and India?<br /><br />There is a simple reason why Prestowitz is likely to be wrong again.  He focuses only on the most positive sides of our international competitors, and the worst ones of ours.  Thus, his arguments are highly unbalanced.  China and India are formidable competitors, and to some degree they should take over the world.  This is just so that the living standards of their citizen reaches something beyond a poor third world level.  However, both China and India face extremely challenging hurdles.  China is absolutely clueless about efficient allocation of capital.  Credit allocation through their banking system is one of the poorest and most corrupt in the world.  The percentage of bad loans within these same banks is causing the entire banking sector to be essentially insolvent.  India on the other hand suffers from an incredibly high illiteracy rate which exceeds 50% of the population.  It has also one of the most byzantine and inefficient government regulatory apparatus.  Ordering a new residential phone line in India is more cumbersome and time consuming then starting a whole new business in the U.S.  These weak spots of China and India are complete blind spots in Prestowitz arguments.  Thus, he reaches dramatic and likely wrong conclusions.  Just like he did when he wrote about Japan back in 1988.<br /><br />The truth of the matter is that a \\"catastrophic\\" type framework sells a lot more books than a more nuanced, and balanced one.  But, reality is typically much more complex than such unidirectional lopsided arguments.  This is especially true when one attempts to predict complex international competitiveness outcome over the next half a century.ial phone line in India is more cumbersome and time consuming then starting a whole new business in the U.S.   These weak spots of China and India are complete blind spots in Prestowitz arguments.

Don't expect to learn one thing about economics, you won't.  Freakonomics should be renamed Freakatistics, as it has a lot more to do with statistics than economics.  The author makes the claim that he is a genius intuitive economist who does not understand math; but reaches brilliant counterintuitive truth through maverick logic.  Thus, he suggests he can make economics accessible for the rest of us.<br /><br />Actually, the core of his arguments is supported by pretty intensive math including multivariate regression analysis, statistics, probabilities, and extensive programming.  Thus, he must have a bright computer programmer in his department who makes up for his lack of mathematical knowledge.<br /><br />Along the same line, there is an embarrassing level of self-adulation throughout the book.  It is imparted by his coauthor Stephen Dubner.  Each chapter is prefaced by some quote from the New York Times magazine article written by Dubner in 2003 stating how Levitt is the greatest.  The first sentence in the preface starts by \\"The most brilliant young economist in America.\\"  Starting another chapter on page 54: \\"Levitt is considered a demigod, one of the most creative people in economics.\\"  Granted some of these quotes are attributed to others, which minimizes their egregiousness.  Nevertheless, Dubner comes across as being Levitt PR agent for the Nobel Prize (decades down the road if ever).  And, Levitt should have put an early stop to this.<br /><br />To further aggravate the self-aggrandizing, Levitt truly believes he is the very first economist who was so brilliant to make economics reachable for the rest of us by explaining mundane everyday life events.  He states he invented a new science: Freakonomics.  However, this is clearly not the case.  \\"Freakonomics\\" existed a long time before Levitt.  David Friedman, son of the famous Milton Friedman, wrote an excellent book on the subject in the mid nineties: \\"Hidden Order: The Economics of Everyday Life.\\"  Gary Becker wrote around the same time: \\"The Economics of Life.\\"  And, Steven Landsburg wrote \\"The Armchair Economist\\" in 1995.  Even the books of Adam Smith, the founder of modern economics, explained individuals behaviors in their everyday lives in response to economic incentives back in the 18th century.  So, even if Levitt's book was truly about economics (which it is not), it is not as original as he claims.<br /><br />Also, the choice of topics is often irrelevant.  There is a fine line between studying the behavioral choices individuals make in their everyday lives, and selecting topics that no one cares about.  The last chapter, associating first names with income and education level, is a case in point.  It comes across as a meaningless filler to make this short book cross over the 200-page barrier.  Just browsing through the table of contents from some of the books mentioned in the previous paragraph, you can see how Friedman and Landsburg have picked topics that are more relevant and related to economics.<br /><br />If you can overcome the mentioned irritants, there are nevertheless some intriguing chapters.  The critical thinking and math developed to investigate cheating among secondary school teachers in Chicago and Sumo wrestlers in Japan are worth reading.  The topic of the \\"asymmetry of information\\" and how real estate agents use it to their advantage is also interesting.<br /><br />Additionally, the chapter on how the onset of legalized abortion back in 1973 was a prime factor driving crime rates downward a decade and a half later is perplexing.  This is his most controversial theory.  At first, I did not believe it.  But, after spending some time googling data on national crime and abortion rates, conducting my own statistical analysis, I arrived at the same conclusion.<br /><br />If the authors had chosen topics more related to economics and had cut out the self- aggrandizing bit, this book could have been all right.  In essence, they would have written a book similar to \\"Hidden Order\\" written by David Friedman.  I gather when you are the son of Milton Friedman; you won't make the same errors these two authors made.  So, was this book over hyped? Definitely!t.

The other was \\"Why People Believe Weird Things.\\"  They are both excellent.  Michael Shermer is quite a polymath and original thinker.  Armed with a Ph.D. in History of Science and an M.S. in Experimental Psychology, Shermer has acquired an outstanding understanding of the scientific method.<br /><br />He is an excellent writer who has developed a lively style.  He turns dry material (the integrity of science) into very entertaining books.  You will note that my review jumps around quite a bit.  That's because the book does too.  It does not always follow a sequential pattern.  However, it makes the book more fun to read.<br /><br />At the beginning of the book, the author provides you with very good critical thinking tools, including 10 different steps to test a claim, and how to spot a crank.  He also provides his assessment of the scientific credibility of various theories by assigning \\"fuzzy fractions.\\"  A 0.9 denotes a theory that is totally credible and well supported by science.  A 0.1 denotes just the opposite.  On such grounds, I like his distinction between SETI (Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence) where he assigns it a respectable 0.5 and UFO where he assigns it a disrespectable 0.1.  Thus, the search for extraterrestrial intelligence may have scientific merit.  Meanwhile, testimonials of alien abductions have none.<br /><br />Near the end of the book, Shermer comes back to providing more thinking tools as he shares six key steps on how to develop one's creative genius in the chapter: The Amadeus Myth.  This is a fascinating chapter where he uncovers that what we interpret as gifted genius is incredibly hard work.  We just observe the end product: virtuosity.  But, this masks the incredibly hard life long work these individuals had undertaken whether they were Mozart or Einstein.<br /><br />Over several chapters he covers the interesting research from Sulloway who conducted psychological analysis of what makes a likely scientific innovator.  Through his work, the author studies in detail the profile of Carl Sagan, Stephen Jay Gould, and other scientists.  Such luminaries typically have a very high openness to new ideas combined with an equally high level of skepticism.  And, it is this combination that makes them unique.  How many people do you know are open to new radical concepts, yet have the critical thinking quotient of testing such wild claims.  That's the type of mind that can differentiate between SETI and UFOs without being either embarrassed or gullible.<br /><br />The author also provides an excellent synthesis on the subject of ecocide.  In just a few pages, he summarizes very efficiently what Jared Diamond took over 500 pages to investigate in his most recent book \\"Collapse.\\"  Shermer describes how several regional primitive civilizations exploited their natural resources to the detriment of their own survival.  These included the Incas of Machu Picchu and the Polynesians of Easter Island among others.  He then asks the chilling question of what will we do?  Will we prevent further environmental deterioration?  Or, will we commit ecocide too?  All along he promotes policies based on the best scientific evidence supported by data absent of any political bias.<br /><br />Throughout the book, there is an underlying admiration of Darwin.  He is the benchmark of scientific integrity, and scientific timelessness.  He was with few peers in his capability of fighting the status quo, questioning his theories until he had anticipated every rational rebuttal the scientific community could throw at him.  In one chapter, he contrasts Darwin with Freud.  Darwin was concerned primarily with the scientific basis of his theories.  He never stopped refining them, researching them deeper to make sure of their validity.  As a result, Darwin's posterity is second to none.  Instead, Freud got more concerned about fame and posterity than the soundness of his theories.  As a result, posterity was not kind to Freud.  As a sign of things to come within the book, early on Shermer had assigned a fuzzy fraction of 0.9 to Darwin's theory of evolution.  Meanwhile, he assigned only a 0.1 to Freudian psychoanalytic theory.  In other words, Darwin's theory fully withstood the test of time, while Freud did not.sterity than the soundness of his theories.  As a result, posterity was not kind to Freud.

The author advances that cities either thrive or die based on three variables: 1) their sacredness; 2) their safety; and 3) commerce.  Sacredness seems like a very questionable driver of a city's success.  Is Jerusalem or Mecca ever likely to be a more successful city than Dallas or Seattle?  Unlikely.  Also, safety does not seem like a differentiating variable but more like a necessity for a city.  It is like saying you need to speak English to be a successful student at Harvard.  You need a lot more than that.  So, does a city need a lot more than to be safe to become a successful city.  Finally, the third variable, commerce, is self-evident and appears the only valid one out of the three mentioned variables.<br /><br />The present and future of a city most probably depend on a number of variables not well detailed by the author including:<br /><br />1) Fiscal condition, or does a city has a healthy and growing tax revenue base that can suffice to cover its related cost of delivering public services and running city government?<br /><br />2) Quality of municipal services including transportation, and most importantly education.  For a city to thrive, it needs to deliver very strong secondary and post secondary educational services.<br /><br />3) An innovative business and cultural environment.  Is the city a nest of creativity resulting in a high rate of innovation within commerce, but also the arts, and other domain?  Does the city develop other related competitive edges associated with specialized network of professionals?  New York benefits a great deal from the huge human capital concentrated in \\"Wall Street.\\"  San Francisco and San Jose benefit greatly from being within close reach of both Silicon Valley and venture capitalists<br /><br />4) A strategic location.  Is the city located at a gateway of domestic or international trading routes?  Is it located near a coast, an airport, and a major harbor so it is quickly accessible from around the World?<br /><br />5) A strategic virtual location.  How connected is the city?  Does its information infrastructure measure up to other World-class cities?<br /><br />6) Economic demographics of its residents.  What is the educational level and per capita income of its residents?  What is the level of homeownership? Business ownership?<br /><br />Obviously, many of these variables are interconnected.  And, many are associated with what the author calls commerce.  However, he did not drill down on many of these related variables.  Even though such variables would allow you to truly differentiate in a statistically meaningful and analytically insightful way between cities.<br /><br />Meanwhile, the author offers just vague platitude devoid of much insight on the subject.  The model he proposes based on his three variables explains a bit about distant history, but much less about the future.<br /><br />This book was especially disappointing given that the same author has written one of the most original and insightful books I have read.  Indeed, back in 1994 he wrote an excellent book called \\"Tribes\\" that does an excellent job of differentiating the culture and behavior of many of the World's most interesting clans or ethnic groups.  He also maps out what such cultural and behavioral features entail in terms of the present and future success of these different demographic clans (clustered by either religion, race, or nationality).  Thus, the author was able to deliver much insight about the various clans of the human race.  Unfortunately, he delivered nearly none regarding cities.<br /><br />Thus, I strongly recommend you skip \\"The City\\" and read \\"Tribes\\" instead.rld?  <br /> <br />5) A strategic virtual location.

This is an excellent book.  The authors have done extensive research from both a legal and economic standpoint to support their hypothesis that companies with better Board governance, more accountable CEOs, better structured CEO compensation packages perform much better than the others.  They show better operating performance resulting in superior shareholder value creation over the long term.<br /><br />Their diagnostic of what ales executive compensations are so well grounded they have become common knowledge for any readers of the financial press over the past couple of decades.  Compensation of CEOs and other top officers has become insane.  The structure of equity compensation has become so tilted in the CEOs favor that as the authors indicate they really don't have to perform.  If they perform poorly they make a boatload of money.  If their performance is about average they make an astronomical amount of money.  What kind of pay-for-performance is this?<br /><br />Other reviewers have had surprisingly strong reactions to the authors' proposals to redress the effectiveness of executive compensation.  I found that surprising given that the authors' proposals are not that radical to begin with.  They boil down to restructuring equity compensation so they reflect targets and vesting periods that make economic sense and align the economic interest of the executive with the long-term interest of shareholders.  Their proposals also entails a massive shift of power from entrenched Board members plagued with serious conflict of interest to the shareholders of the companies who are the ones bearing the full brunt of the equity risk.  In the days of the Enron, Tyco International, Arthur Andersen recent scandals, I find the authors recommendations rather sound.  I do think a shift from Board to shareholder power would do a good deal to restore the integrity of certain executives, the transparency and the quality of accounting and financial disclosure.<br /><br />Thus, I really think you will enjoy and learn a lot from this book.  In a similar fashion, if you want to educate yourself regarding how movie stars are paid, and why just like CEOs they may be grossly overpaid I strongly recommend the recently released book \\"The Big Picture\\" by Edward Jay Epstein.  This is another fascinating point that touches on the sensitive topic of a privilege group that earns a staggering amount of money hardly justifiable on any grounds.Thus, I really think you will enjoy and learn a lot from this book.

This is an interesting book, but its basic premise is directionally completely flawed.  He truly believes that because of rising inequality in the U.S. and other factors, the \\"creative class\\" will pack its bags and go overseas to places like Western Europe with a more equalitarian society.<br /><br />Just the opposite is true.  Within all societies there is always a tension between equality and opportunity.  The U.S. is the one society the most tilted towards opportunity.  This means it is the one with typically one of the lowest tax rates on businesses and corporations, least bureaucratic red tape, and resulting best business climate for entrepreneurship.  On the dark side, the U.S. has one of the weakest safety net in terms of social benefits within industrialized societies.  That's the price to pay as a society for low tax rates on businesses.  An equalitarian society such as Western Europe is just at the opposite extreme on this equality vs opportunity axis.  There you have an abundant safety net of all kinds.  Heck, you are sometimes better off being unemployed than working.  But, this comes at a price including higher tax rates and extensive regulations that often hinder capital formation and entrepreneurship.<br /><br />In view of the above, the U.S. is actually a world magnet for the \\"creative\\" types.  Why?  It is because where they have the best opportunity of making the big bucks.  There is also more venture capital available here to anyone with a brilliant idea then in probably the entire remainder of the World.  This is true for a simple reason.  The concept of venture capital hardly exist in many other developed countries.<br /><br />Even idealistic types who are not in it just for the money, often end up emigrating to the U.S. for networking extensively with the U.S. creative intelligentsia.  A case in point is Linus Torvalds, the Finnish who invented the Linux operating system.  He could have been nearly as rich as Bill Gates if he had wanted to.  However, his maverick business model is based on a brilliant but free operating system (Linux).  As a result, he is no billionaire.  Nevertheless, where does he live today? Helsinki not!  He lives in Portland.  Simply put, the U.S. despite all of Florida's criticism, is still one of the most free-wheeling, dealing society in the World.  The IT infrastructure, and the resulting IT human capital is second to none.  And, for Torvald, if he wanted to remain actively engaged in the game of changing the World as he saw it through enlightened technology, he had no recourse but move to the U.S. to achieve what he wanted to do.  Let's take the reverse example:  what do you think is the chance of Bill Gates, Steve jobs, Larry Ellison moving to Helsinki any time soon because Finland has a more equalitarian society?  Well, the question is the answer.  It is not happening.<br /><br />So, just count all the Bill Gates who are moving to Munich, Marseilles, London, Stockholm or Helsinki vs all the Linus Torvalds who are moving to the U.S. and you very quickly debunked Florida's thesis.ck business model is based on a brilliant but free operating system (Linux).

This is a very detailed and insightful book on the movie entertainment business.  Epstein researched an enormous amount of proprietary financial information from the Motion Picture Association All Media Revenue Report (MPA).  This is a report disclosed only to the studios that details movie earnings.  It is unclear how Epstein obtained access to this proprietary data.  Epstein leveraged this proprietary data into an incredibly insightful analysis of the movie-entertainment industry.  Thanks to Epstein lively writing style the book is a quick read despite the volume of information provided.<br /><br />The movie business is not an economically viable stand-alone business.  Indeed, over 95% of the movies loose a ton of money at the Box Office even if they often generate hundreds of millions in such Box Office revenues.  Movies have become extremely expensive advertising for a very risky long-term investment in an \\"intellectual property\\" right.  The pioneer of such a business model was Walt Disney who fully grasped the possibilities of the ancillary businesses more than half a century ago.<br /><br />Related ancillary revenues generated by videos, Pay TV, and Networks dwarf the revenues at the Box Office.  While the major studios derived 100% of their revenues from Box Office in 1948, this percentage has continuously dropped to only 18% in 2003.  Additionally, these ancillary businesses are almost all profits.  The vast majority of the production costs have already been absorbed within the Box Office business.<br /><br />However, a majority of movies still loose money when you figure the full life cycle of its \\"intellectual property.\\"  Epstein details throughout the book such a cycle for \\"Gone In 60 Seconds\\" with Nicolas Cage.  At first, the movie seems a roaring success as it grossed $242 million in worldwide Box Office.  But, when you figure the whole cycle, as of 2003 the movie including the ancillary businesses was still $150 million in the tank.<br /><br />The reason movies still get made is because there are so many willing equity partners absorbing the brunt of the losses in financing movies.  The studios survive because they are supported by their strong parent holding companies whose businesses are diversified in technology, news, media, and consumer products.  The directors and stars make a fortune.  And, the equity partners are the ones loosing their shirts.<br /><br />After reading this book, one assesses that movie stars are the most overpaid human beings on the planet.  In one single movie, they often make more money than sports stars make over their entire career (tennis or golf comes to mind).  Even though some stars do attract the public, the underlying economics of their movies over the full cycle is not attractive.  If it were not for equity partners making irrational investment decisions, the castle of cards would crumble.<br /><br />The book also breaks or confirms many interesting myths.  For one, Tom Cruise does not do his own stunts despite what you see in DVD bonus features.  This is because insurers cover the risk that Tom Cruise will not be able to complete the shooting of the movie.  The face of an actor is now digitized on to the body of a stuntman.  So, when you see a close up of Tom Cruise jumping off a cliff it really looks like him.  Another interesting concept is that movie theatres make more money from selling popcorn and sodas than from showing the movie.  It is true!  The movie represents foot traffic.  The popcorn and sodas represent the high profit margin business segment they don't share with the studios.<br /><br />There are a zillion more interesting facts mentioned within the book embedded in a coherent and very entertaining history of the movie business from its inception to nowadays.

I own several of them.  And, I refer to them constantly.  My daughter is in high school, and we use this college information almost on a daily basis.  Now, she is looking one step beyond and considering different career paths.<br /><br />I spent an hour doing research on career guides at Amazon.  I also did more research by browsing in the best physical bookstore I know off (Stacey's in San Francisco).  After conducting this data gathering, I came up with a clear winner, this Princeton Review book.  There is just so much more information, more concisely, and clearly presented than in any of the other career guides I browsed through.<br /><br />This career guide answered all the basics questions we had on this vast subject.  The Birkman Career test as outlined near the introduction is excellent.  Just to verify the accuracy of this test I took it myself.  And, it was spot on.  I know it will be a great help for my daughter too.<br /><br />The book describes in detail about 230 different professions or careers.  For each profession, the 2004 edition discloses detailed salary information (at the start, after 5 years, after 10 years).  It indicates what kind of journals such professionals read.  It describes the requirements to enter the field, what it takes to build a foundation in a small section called \\"Paying Your Dues.\\"  It also discloses what kind of careers you can easily transfer your skills into.  For instance, an economist can become a statistician, banker, financial analyst, or journalist, among other professions.<br /><br />At the top of each right-handed page, the book also has four little icons that quickly let you know info about: pay, working hours, educational requirement, and contribution to society associated with a given profession.  The book also gives you realistic lifestyle expectation over the next two, five, and ten years for each profession.<br /><br />Just as its college guides, the Princeton Review packs in an amazing amount of information in just two pages.  This time it is not about a specific college, but instead a specific profession.  I would think that be more difficult.  But, Princeton Review handled it just as elegantly.  I strongly recommend this book for any one interested in the subject.lege guides, the Princeton Review packs in an amazing amount of information in just two pages.

This is an interesting book by one of the leading specialists in economic development.  His diagnosis of what ails the economic development of many Third World countries, and the African continent in particular is excellent.<br /><br />However, his solutions are utopic.  He proposes an across the board 5% increase in U.S. income tax to fund U.N. antipoverty programs with little control from Washington.  That's just not going to happen.<br /><br />The U.S. is struggling with the present and upcoming fiscal tidal wave of elderly claims (Medicare and Social Security).  Also, the U.S. is tackling the fiscal burden of supporting military operations Worldwide.  Thus, in the view of such huge fiscal costs, the U.S. is in little mood to up its generosity in non military related foreign aid beyond it's already ambitious Millennium Account program.<br /><br />All other industrialized countries face even greater fiscal challenges than the U.S. due to the same elderly claims.  These countries' populations are aging faster and, their related elderly benefits (equivalent of Social Security and Medicare) are costlier.  Under such fiscal constraints where can you expect a pick up in foreign aid.<br /><br />The present and future of foreign aid is in good part the private sector.  Individuals such as Bill Gates, and Ted Turner may have more influence on developing vaccine, and Aids prevention program for Africa than entire governments.  The author touches on this.  But, he still expects that the major source of increased in foreign aids will come from the government sector.  In view of the mentioned fiscal constraints, this is not likely.  Thus, even though this book is interesting, and very well researched, because of the author's completely ignoring fiscal realities, I can't recommend it.	2005-04-03

I am a big fan of this little \\"green book\\" statistical series.  Thanks to it, I already taught myself Logit Regression, Cluster Analysis, Discriminant Analysis, Factor Analysis, and Correspondence Analysis.  Most of these were excellent; \\"Principal Component Analysis\\" (PCA) was good.<br /><br />The reasons I don't consider it excellent like some of the others are:  First, the terminology is kind of dated and confusing.  The author talks about of Latent Roots and Latent vectors when the more common names nowadays are Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors.  Also, the author mentions in the introduction, he will explain most concepts without relying on Matrix Algebra.  Yet, he does to a great extent.  If you are not familiar with Matrix Algebra, you will be forced to learn it to better understand this book.  Finally, the author gives you many formulas that are sometimes difficult to understand, especially when he rarely fleshes out the related calculations in a concrete example.<br /><br />Despite the negative comments mentioned above, the book has an equal or greater number of strong points too.  Let's face it PCA is complicated.  There is no way to make it appear really simple and easy to understand.  This book is the kind you have to read, underline, work through examples, and review again.  I suspect any book on PCA would be similar.<br /><br />In view of the above, the author takes interesting examples out of the social science.  He develops a strong foundation in PCA.  He also does a good job of showing how PCA is at the foundation of many other multivariate analysis methods.<br /><br />This green book series has allowed me to hang in there and keep up within an intense quantitative group of a major financial institution on the West Coast.  Without them, I would have been left behind.  For the record, I am an MBA type and not a quant type.  So, if I can understand these books, so can you.  I recommend this one book if you need to understand PCA.  Just accept upfront, it is not going to be easy reading.  But, it does the job of explaining PCA.Just accept upfront, it is not going to be easy reading.  But, it does the job of explaining PCA.   <br />	2005-03-28
US	52977415	R3SPN9Q1JU8D8S	1558215662	366248921	Too Soon to Panic	Books	2	0	2	N	Y	Not much insight about tennis vs other books.	After all the hype about this book, I was rather disappointed.  Bud Collins, George Plimpton, and Pete Sampras all suggest he is a virtuoso among the tennis writing aficionados.  Well maybe not...<br /><br />The author's style reads like a flowery lightweight novel.  The book is more about Gordon Forbes' strange state of mind, including his weird panic-anxious attacks that he suffers during his sleep walking bouts and the strange adventures of his lifelong doubles partner Abe Segal.  Actually, as you read on Abe Segal quickly becomes the center stage character.  The problem is that his words and actions do not seem quiet believable.  How much of all his behaviors are either heavily romanticized or outright fabricated?<br /><br />The author also uses this interesting back-and-forth mechanism whereby one paragraph describes a very vaguely tennis related scene in the 60s, and the very next one describes a parallel scene maybe at the same tournament in the 90s.  So, in the 60s he may be mentioning a match between Art Larsen and Nicolas Pietrangeli; and in the very next paragraph he now describes an Agassi vs Courier match.  Both matches were probably fascinating, and their contrast could have been equally entertaining to analyze in some depth.  But, within one weak paragraph that is not what you get from the author.  Instead,  the author escapes any valid analytical effort at this juxtaposition of interesting matches and escapes back to the near-fiction of Abe Segal's adventures around the World.<br /><br />Somehow perplexing, is who were Gordon Forbes and Abe Segal anyway?  Well, they are now both in their seventies.  They were among the top South African players in the early sixties.  This did not mean much at a time when Australians dominated tennis, and certainly completely overshadowed them.  Names like Rosewall, Hoad, Emerson, Laver, Fraser, Stolle are definitely part of tennis history.  Forbes and Segal are not.  But, you have to give it to them they were nevertheless excellent players.  How many outstandingly gifted tennis players are they who are not even known in their prime?  Well, that is Forbes and Segal for you.  From what I gather they were a pretty formidable doubles team.  And, made the quarters of a couple of grand slam tournaments.  However, they were never good enough to get their name in print on any major tennis cup.  Thus, they left the game without leaving a trace.<br /><br />However, Forbes background was ideal for the making of a world class tennis historian and writer.  Here was a journeyman tennis player who exchanged tennis strokes with the Australian greats.  He played tennis just before the onset of the Open tennis era (1968).  But, he remained engaged in the sport and followed it closely till nowadays.  Thus, he had all the empirical data to be as good a writer as many profess he his on the subject.  Somehow, I just don't think he cut it as a writer.  I learned so little about the game and its changing atmosphere between the 60s to nowadays.<br /><br />The book has some moments.  The description of the early professional tour with Trabert, and other old timers is poignant.  You feel almost pity at the hardship these guys experienced, killing each other with tennis balls day in day out for a few miserable bucks that seemed like hardly above minimum wage in total anonymity.  This compared to the surreal richness and fame of today's tennis pros makes for a painful contrast.  Unfortunately, from within this book such poignant moments are too few and far in between.<br /><br />Instead, I strongly recommend three contemporary books: \\"You can't be serious\\" by John McEnroe; \\"Bad News McEnroe\\" by Bill Scanlon; and \\"Tennis Confidential\\" (forgot the author).  All those three books are so much more intense and get into the mental and physical blood and guts of professional men's tennis.  You learn so much more insightful info on the game.  Let's face it Gordon Forbes was never a John McEnroe on or off the tennis court.  Actually, he was not a Bill Scanlon either (Bill's book is excellent).nroe on or off the tennis court.  Actually, he was not a Bill Scanlon either (Bill's book is excellent).                            <br /> <br />                      <br />          <br /> <br />     <br /> <br />	2005-03-20

This is an excellent and easy to read book about the fascinating analysis of the heritage of mankind.  The author has developed an extensive multidisciplinary approach that includes: a) archeology, b) history,  c) genetics, d) linguistics, and e) mathematics.<br /><br />Although the author never stresses mathematics as a key discipline to analyze mankind heritage, his work relied on Principal Component Analysis, Multidimensional Scaling, Cluster Analysis, Logistic Regression, and Hypothesis Testing.  Thus, the readers familiar with these statistical methods will enjoy reading this book as a fascinating social science application of such methods.<br /><br />You certainly don't have to be a mathematician or a scientist to enjoy this book.  The author has clearly written it as an introduction to this field aimed at the layperson.<br /><br />You will learn many fascinating concepts.  One of those, is that the history of genes, cultures, and languages converge.  In essence, they all influence each other back and forth.  It is somehow hard to tell what is the main driver of overall changes in population.  You run into many Nature or Nurture arguments.  Continuing along the same line, he refers to other scientific works explaining the difference in IQ between individuals.  Well, it is 1/3 due to heredity (nature); 1/3 due to cultural transmission (nurture); and 1/3 due to differences in personal experience (random).  That is a pretty far cry from the 80% to 90% due to heredity that many people believe in.  Also, natural evolution will or has already stopped according to the author.  This is because medicine in industrialized societies has reduced the natural mortality rate down to almost zero among the pre-reproductive age set.  In other words, medicine has eliminated the natural selection process as the survival rate mechanism of our specie.  Some of us may have had concepts that humans  eventually will evolve and look like aliens with extremely big heads (for superior intelligence and processing powers) and very skimpy bodies (since physical force is useless in an information age).  Well, that's not going to happen.<br /><br />Throughout the book there are many very interesting graphs and maps that beautifully illustrate and clarify the concepts he introduces.  The migration map on page 94, clearly outlines all the major original migrations out of Africa starting 100,000 years ago.  On page 71, a world map showing the actual genetic distance between locations is fascinating too.  On page 164, you can observe the best diagram of the Indo-European languages you will ever see.  English is a Germanic language, as we all know.  However, English predates German by several centuries!<br /><br />You can see how throughout his life, he must have been a fantastic university professor.  About 6 months ago, I started reselling my books at Amazon Marketplace to cut my cost of reading.  However, I am not reselling this one.  I am keeping it as a reference.  I anticipate there will be so many occasions when I will be glad I have kept it.

US	52977415	R2TF30RRMFQGSE	1401301126	288801979	Privilege: Harvard and the Education of the Ruling Class	Books	5	52	76	N	N	Excellent analysis from a Harvard insider.	This is the second excellent self-deprecating book about Harvard I have read.  The first one is \\"Harvard Schmarvard\\" by Jay Matthews, a must-read college guide for any one going through the college admission/selection phase.  On the other hand, Ross Douthat book is not a college guide, but it is a fascinating insider documentary on one's Harvard education experience.<br /><br />Contrary to what we believe, Harvard is not an academic pressure cooker.  Grade inflation is actually so rampant, that a notorious professor decided to adopt a dual grading system.  Thus, he decided to give his students two grades, the first one is the grade they truly deserved.  This grade is known by no one else but the students themselves.  The second grade is curved reflecting Harvard's grade inflation and is the one that will go on the transcript.  Thus, you could have a bunch a B- students graduating with very impressive A - GPAs going on to the top business, law, and med schools in the country.  The author explained this process is the result of the inevitable commercialization of grades.  In other words, GPAs now mean access to the top graduate schools, and thus mean a lot of money over the lifetime career earnings of Harvard undergraduates.  Thus, professors are under rising pressures to give good grades.  The days when a professor may be subject to lawsuits for giving less than sterling grades may not be far away.<br /><br />The author goes on criticizing Harvard's \\"Core\\" curriculum that has not changed since 1978.  He states that the Core was a politically correct effort to get away from the \\"elitist\\" framework of the more rigorous earlier curriculum that had a traditional \\"Great Books\\" framework.  Thus, nowadays a student is increasingly unlikely to have studied Shakespeare, Goethe, or Proust.  Instead, he may have been exposed to unknown authors who are perceived by the teachers to be equally deserving of legacy from a politically correct framework.  Also, the level of research and insightfulness required on studying such writers by both the students and their professors, is really mediocre.  Also, the Core offers no sense of breadth and depth.  A course on inequality in Mexico in the 20th Century will receive the same credit as one on Reason and Faith in the West since the onset of the Renaissance.  Also, if the latter course is deemed to be excellent by the students, it will be swamped and overbooked.  Thus, it will be highly unlikely you will be able to take it during your four years at Harvard.  You may have to take the course on inequality in Mexico whether you want to or not, if you want to graduate on time and not spend an extra $40K for an extra year at Harvard.<br /><br />The author also directly criticizes the quality of the teaching.  He found most professors to be unengaged and more concerned about their research and journals publications.  Many classes were taught by overburdened teaching assistants.  Finally, counseling was sorely lacking.  Harvard offers thousands of potentially very interesting classes, but no one helps you in figuring out what are the magic 32 ones that you should take over the next four years.  The author describes this process as a random function.<br /><br />Thus, after reading this book you conclude that Harvard may still provide the most lucrative and coveted college degree in the U.S.  A career of richness (materially) may be open to you, if you do get this magical piece of paper.  But, will you get an education whose quality matches the illustriousness of the piece of paper?  The author's conclusion, is certainly not.  That is an obviously gutsy stand.  You hope the Harvard establishment reads this book, and works on correcting the many educational weaknesses uncovered by the author.  This process can only help further the reputation of the school.  From what I understand Laurence Summers, the current Dean, is working on it and upsetting everyone in the process.  That's an interesting unfolding political battle to watch.ing unfolding political battle to watch.	2005-02-27

Just like John Nash of \\"A Beautiful Mind\\"-fame was a few years ago.  The movie \\"The Aviator\\" has been nominated for more Oscars than any other.  And, after seeing the movie everyone wants to know more about Howard Hughes and attempt to crack the mystery that was his life.<br /><br />There is no question Hughes' character was mythical.  He was part Chuck Yeager, Donald Trump, Hugh Heffner, Steven Spielberg, and a genuine madman all combined in a strikingly handsome 6 foot 4 inches body frame.  After reading this book, however, you may find that Hughes was ultimately more successful at creating a myth than anything else.  Looking at his private life and business ventures, you will conclude that he was a tragic failure.<br /><br />This book has to be the most detailed biography on Hughes.  The authors conducted a Herculean research effort that entailed the examination of a quarter million pages of records and documents, and reproducing over 50,000 pages of them.  They traveled to numerous cities in the U.S. and Japan to conduct this research.  As a result of this unparalleled research, the authors wrote a tightly written 600 page book in extremely small font.  Thus, it is not a quick read.  But, it is incredibly informative and fascinating.<br /><br />The scope and the details on Howard Hughes business and legal dealings is extremely thorough.  And, you get a real sense of who he was, the way he thought, the way he mismanaged every business enterprises he engaged in.  Hughes was obsessive about so many things.  In business, he developed a weird set of obsessions that included not paying any taxes, becoming a major airline owner at all costs, becoming an aircraft manufacturer and also a defense contractor at all costs.  For him, manufacturing an aircraft for the Department of Defense became a lifelong obsession.  Contrary to what the outside World may believe, Hughes was not a brilliant businessman.  Much to the contrary, he was really a madman.  For every dollar he did not pay or save in taxes, he actually lost a dollar fifty or so.  Thus, his various tax schemes were disasters from an after tax return standpoint.  He also did not have the organizational, and managerial talent to pull off any of his grandiose obsessions to economic fruition.  Hughes would certainly have become much richer being just a regular Trust baby supported by the extraordinary capital generated by the company created by his father, the Hughes Tool Company.  The latter made a fortune by developing the most advanced oil drilling head.  It became so successful as to become nearly a monopoly throughout the entire worldwide oil industry.  This invention created the fortune that financed all of Howard Hughes business fantasies and fiascos.  However, if he had done so [just become a Trust baby] he would not have become Howard Hughes and offer us the spectacle of one of the most grandiose, grotesque, and tragic life of modern times.<br /><br />The authors also covers in detail Hughes social life, movie producing years, and his long and irreversible descent into madness.  This part is easier reading than the legal business disputes.  The psychological profile that emerges is almost unbelievable.<br /><br />The book does an excellent job of debunking several myths about Hughes.  One of them is Hughes the world class philanthropist.  Indeed, he is known has having given during his lifetime a fortune to medical research.  Well during his lifetime, his creation of The Howard Hughes Medical Institute was nothing more than a leveraged lease tax avoidance mechanism.  Most of his donations funding this nonprofit entity went back to him in the form of lease payments on properties rented from various Hughes corporations at above market rents by this institute.  Nowadays, the IRS never would grant such a research institute any tax-exempt status.  In the Appendices, the authors do an excellent job of documenting the cash flows associated with this tax avoidance scheme.  Almost, zero % of the donation to this institute went to medical research.<br /><br />At the end of the book, the \\"Chronology\\" is an excellent timeline map to get an overview of Hughes life.  I found myself referring to it constantly to get my bearings of where was I in this convoluted story.  Did he incur his first major mental breakdown before or after his spectacular Congressional hearings where he outwitted and demolished his Congressional nemesis?  Amazingly enough, a quick reference to the Chronology confirms that he incurred his mental breakdown before the hearings.<br /><br />Also, the Epilogue is brilliant.  It fully captures the essence and drama of this life and provides a coherent thematic summary of this 600 page book.<br /><br />In any case, if you really want to find out more about Hughes this is the book.ows associated with this tax avoidance scheme.

This is not one of them.  The author constructs a bizarre case that the decrease in fertility rate represents a global population crisis.  It is not.<br /><br />Fertility rates are decreasing because they must.  Between 1950 and 2000, the World population rose 244% from 2.5 billion to 6.1 billion.  This was associated with an unsustainable annual growth rate of 1.80%.  The UN's median scenario projects that annual growth rate will decrease to 0.76% over the 2000 to 2050 period and that the World population will rise to 8.9 billion by then.  That represents a nearly 50% increase over today's World population.  This will put immense pressure on the environment.<br /><br />Worldwide average statistics are nearly meaningless.  Far more relevant is to explore the demographic fate of specific regions.  Referring to the same UN median scenario.  The population of less developed countries is expected to grow from 4.9 billion to 7.7 billion between 2000 and 2050.  This represents a 57% growth in population of over the next 50 years.  This is a tragedy.  The entire population growth of the globe is concentrated in the areas that can least afford it from both a natural resource and economic standpoints.  This growth combined with decline in potable water will result in a Malthusian juggernaut.  Available water per capita throughout the Arab countries is estimated to plummet by over 60%.  Throughout most of Africa the situation is worse.  The author is concerned that the fertility rate throughout these regions is expected to drop too quickly.  Instead, he should be appalled they are not expected to decline faster.<br /><br />The author acknowledges the well known fiscal stress associated with population aging in industrialized societies.  The majority of government elderly benefits need to be reformed to some degree.  Social security taxes have to be raised (cap removed to a higher level).  Fully vested age levels have to be raised to reflect longer life expectancy, and Medicare (already bankrupt today) has to be completely restructured.<br /><br />Faced with the above dilemma, the author instead recommends that parents do not pay any social security taxes because they have already assumed the cost for bringing up their kids. Thus, a system that is already grossly under funded today would we wiped out instantly.<br /><br />Also, despite the gigantic fiscal stress on industrialized countries associated with their unfunded liabilities to the elderly, he believes these same countries will export capital to lesser developed countries to boost their labor productivity.  That just does not add up.  The U.S. in particular is already a huge importer of capital (net foreign investment) and will continue even more so the minute Social Security incurs a negative yearly cash flow (around 2019 much earlier than the expected insolvency of the Social Security Trust fund between 2042 to 2052).<br /><br />Instead of this misinformed book, I recommend the following excellent books on related subjects: Laurence Kotlikoff's \\"The Coming Generational Storm\\"; and Robert Stowe England two excellent books: \\"Global Aging and Financial Markets\\" and \\"The Fiscal Aging of an Industrial World.\\".

The author develops an original argument that the Islamic insurrection is imploding on its own.  In other words,  Osama bin Laden's Jihad is viewed as intolerable terror against innocent civilians by a majority of Muslims.  Over time, the Muslim peace lovers will progressively dwarf the ranks of the Jihadists.<br /><br />In the author's mind, this is especially true if the U.S. gets out of the way and stop waging an ill fated War on Terror that keeps throwing oil on the fire of the Jihad movement.  He makes a case that the U.S. ongoing backing of Israel and its invasion of Iraq have strongly boosted Al Qaeda's ranks.<br /><br />The author belongs to the camp that believe that the Islamic insurrection is almost solely a counter reaction to U.S. foreign policy.  It certainly is a factor, but how can it be the main driver?  9/11 was totally unsolicited.  Also, prior act of terrorism were more often than not caused by the U.S. government becoming friendlier towards various Middle Eastern ones rather than the opposite.  Thus, whether the U.S. supports or attacks a Middle Eastern state, it appears as justification for act of Islamic terrorism.  What kind of rational is that.<br /><br />The Pew Global Attitudes surveys and current events don't support any of the author's original arguments.  Osama bin Laden's aura is ever increasing.  Islam is becoming increasingly fundamentalist and violent throughout the Middle East and Africa.  Wherever it overlaps with Christian population bloodshed results more often than not executed by the Muslims and suffered by the Christians such as in Somalia, Rwanda, and Sudan.<br /><br />So, the main thesis of letting Islam extremism implode on its own just does not hold well to any reality check.  Right now it is picking up steam big time.<br /><br />Instead, I recommend a far more prescient book on the subject: Samuel Huntington's \\"The Clash of Civilizations.\\"  He has a far better understanding of Islam's extremism from a geopolitical and demographic standpoints.rom a geopolitical and demographic standpoints.	2005-02-12

I am a big fan of the Greene's Guides, as I have read several of them.  So far, they all were excellent.  However, I found this one the weakest.  It is too long for the amount of info it conveys.  Do we really need that many pages disclosing numerous candidates essays, or in detail profile of international students applying to the U.S.  As a result, the book is boring.<br /><br />When I read a college guide I now look for two things.  First, does it offer new insights, a new angle to the whole college admission process?  And, second how many mistakes do they make due to outdated data, wrong assumptions.  Then, I balance the two (the positives and the negatives).<br /><br />This book does not come out well because it has few practical insights.  The info provided is general, and readily shared by any other college guide.  The one insight that is interesting is Chapter 7, the Pie Chart Analysis.  This is where you figure out what are your unique qualities that make you a stronger candidate for a specific school.  Unfortunately, how many of us own world-beating skills that make us a special candidate.  The author mentions the case of a women who was the second nationally ranked squash player who got in a Ivy League with a strong women's squash program while she had a B+ GPA and a 1300 SAT (poor by Ivy standard).  Well, that's great but how helpful is that for the rest of us.<br /><br />However, the book contains several outright mistakes.  The authors repeat several times that one should not apply Early Admission (EA) or Early Decision (ED) unless one's academic profile is stronger than the average accepted students.  This is plain wrong.  The authors made the human mistake to believe misleading, politically correct statements from admission officers.  The reality supported by objective data is completely different.  Just study \\"The Early Admission Game\\" the best book on the subject.  And, based on that author's statistical analysis applying EA gives you an advantage equivalent to boosting your SAT score by 70 points (old SAT, probably 105 points new SAT).  Meanwhile, applying ED gives you an advantage of 100 points on old SAT (probably 150 points new SAT).  If you apply to any Ivy League, MIT, or Stanford you just owe it to yourself to apply through their EA or ED programs.<br /><br />The authors also state that your overall GPA is much more important then test scores.  How could that be?  At that level (Ivy candidates) everyone has close to a 4.0 GPA.  So, the GPA does not differentiate at all between candidates.  From an academic point what does differentiate?  Two things: your grades in AP and honors classes and test scores.  These factors will determine whether you will get into an Ivy League school or not.<br /><br />The authors also recommend going to a less selective school for the first two years; and transfer in your Junior year to a more selective school.  From everything else I have read, that's not going to work.  Transferring is very difficult anyway.  But, in any case transferring sideways or downward is doable.  Transferring upward is nearly impossible.  It is not a recommended college strategy by any one else.<br /><br />There are other mistakes.  But, by now you already get my drift.  The negatives far outweigh the positives.  Thus, I recommend you pass on this one.<br /><br />Instead, I can wholeheartedly recommend some of the other Greenes' Guides that are much more focused, streamlined, and informative.  These include: The Hidden Ivies, The Public Ivies, and Inside the Top Colleges.  This last one is a must read for anyone who is a serious candidate to an Ivy League school.  You'll quickly see that the high profile, pressure cooker environment is not for everyone regardless of IQ.<br /><br />Again, the most interesting book I have read on this subject is \\"The Early Admission Game.\\"  It is one of the first book that uncovered hard data on admission.advantage equivalent to boosting your SAT score by 70 points (old SAT, probably 105 points new SAT).

From everything else I have read, that's not going to work.  Transferring is very difficult anyway.  But, in any case transferring sideways or downward is doable.  Transferring upward is nearly impossible.  It is not a recommended college strategy by any one else. <br /> <br />There are other mistakes.  But, by now you already get my drift.  The negatives far outweigh the positives.  Thus, I recommend you pass on this one.  <br /> <br />Instead, I can wholeheartedly recommend some of the other Greenes' Guides that are much more focused, streamlined, and informative.  These include: The Hidden Ivies, The Public Ivies, and Inside the Top Colleges.  This last one is a must read for anyone who is a serious candidate to an Ivy League school.  You'll quickly see that the high profile, pressure cooker environment is not for everyone regardless of IQ. <br /> <br />Again, the most interesting book I have read on this subject is \\"The Early Admission Game.\\"  It is one of the first book that uncovered hard data on admission.              <br />	2005-02-02

I read this book as a follow up to Philip Jenkins's \\"The Next Christendom.\\"  Unfortunately, it does not compare well.  The book reads like a FAQ (frequently asked questions) from a poorly written website as an infomercial promoting the greatness of Africanized Christianity.<br /><br />The author makes several interesting points however.  One is that Christianity has grown faster than Islam because Christianity has allowed for the Bible to be translated in tens if not hundreds of different vernacular languages.  Christianity has even allowed indigenous population to use their own word for God.  Islam has shown no such flexibility or adaptation as one is not allowed to translate the Qoran.  Another interesting point is that according to the author, Christianity at the onset was a religion of peace meanwhile Islam was a religion of the State and the Sword as Mohammed was both a military and political leader.  The author states that the crusades were an aberration of Christianity's history.  And, that today all Christians feel guilt and shame when remembering the crusades.  Meanwhile, Muslims are proud of all the historical and current Jihads they campaigned for.<br /><br />But the above are just interesting concepts lost in a sea of directionless questions and answers.  The author is brilliant, highly educated (teacher at both Harvard and Yale).  But, his book is little more than a random collection of his own subjective opinions not supported well  enough by much facts, studies, or reference to other works.  Because of the odd question and answer format, the author never develops a coherent and focused theory tied to the title's subject.<br /><br />As mentioned, if you want to study this subject more effectively I strongly recommend Philip Jenkins \\"The Next Christendom\\" instead.	2004-12-31
US	52977415	R2SOXA6SWNF4NY	0760320594	697073193	The Sling and the Stone: On War in the 21st Century (Zenith Military Classics)	Books	5	18	22	N	Y	Most insightful book on the history and evolution of warfare	This is a fascinating book that exposed me to a different type of author: the military intellectual.  For many civilians this may represent an oxymoron.  But, reading this lucid, analytical, visionary, and incredibly insightful book will convince you that it is not.  There is intelligence in the military after all.<br /><br />Sadly enough, the material of the book was mainly derived from two long internal essays the author generated within the military back in 1988 and 1994.  So, the concepts that seemed new to me as a civilian at the end of 2004 were known within the military for over a decade.  Thus, even though the author proposed a framework for restructuring the Department of Defense based around human skills able to deal with insurgent warfare instead of solely technological capabilities aimed at outdated State-to-State warfare, the DOD under Rumsfeld and his predecessors chose to go in exactly the wrong direction.<br /><br />The author develops his analytical framework around its main theme: fourth generation warfare (4GW) in 17 very clearly written and sequentially developed short chapters.  Near the beginning of the book, he gives his concept a broadbased historical foundation by suggesting that warfare evolves in parallel to society in general.  So, just as our civilization has evolved from various disaggregated stages including: nomadic, agricultural, industrial, and finally information based; warfare has now also reached its fourth stage centered also on information and the dissemination of ideas.<br /><br />Counterintuitively, the author demonstrates brilliantly that the U.S. DOD is at a huge disadvantage in this new information based warfare style.  Yes, we have superior technology, we have the best weapons.  But, because of our uncreative hierarchical monopolistic centralized organization we are totally incapable of exploiting our technology in a timely manner.  The author takes the example of generating a surveillance request within the DOD.  The turnaround for this information to be authorized and processed will be about a week.  On the other hand, a terrorist group simply watching CNN and using cheap commercially available surveillance technology will have information on many of the enemies positions almost live.<br /><br />The more perplexing challenge is that the U.S. with all its wealth and infrastructure and military personnel represents a huge set of targets.  The insurgents in whatever shape or form are totally stealthy, mixed in within civilian populations, and often use explicitly civilians as either shields or supporting system for their warfare.<br /><br />Another challenge is the battle of ideas.  The 4GW combatants use the media effectively to wear down the political resolve of their enemies.  This entails showing bloody civilian casualties as any result of U.S. offensive.  This is also done by orchestrating spectacularly shocking beheadings of innocent civilians whose only crime were collaborating with the U.S.<br /><br />The author proposes many detailed solutions to all the above challenges.  They appear somewhat Herculean in the changes that the DOD will have to undertake to spend its $500 billion effectively so as to fight today's wars instead of yesterday's.  The author makes an interesting comparison between IBM in the pre PC world and today.  IBM was focused on mainframes where it had an unrivaled advantage.  It did so for too long until mainframes became almost irrelevant.  Today, the technology industry is more flexible, creative, and fast paced moving than IBM was capable of handling.  But, the author feels that the DOD's obsession with developing superior but irrelevant technology at the detriment of developing the smart human skills necessary to deal with 4GW effectively is just as ineffective as IBM's former mainframe based strategy.  What good is superior technology if it takes you five days to turnaround a surveillance request.<br /><br />The most fascinating part of the book is his analysis of Vietnam and the Israeli-Palestinian conflicts (chapters 6 and 8) using his 4GW framework.  These are the most insightful writings I have read on the subject.<br /><br />I strongly recommend this book for how much knowledge it provides not only in military strategy but in the recent history of the most intractable conflicts.  If you are interested in this subject, I also recommend Wesley Clark's \\"Winning Modern Wars\\"; Robert Kaplan's \\"The Coming Anarchy\\" and van Crevald's \\"The Transformation of War.\\"  All these books outline the changes of warfare, and complement nicely this book.  But, this book serves as the core of the knowledge base regarding the evolution of warfare from a State-to-State phenomena to something completely different the DOD is ill equipped to deal with organizationally.ing part of the book is his analysis of Vietnam and the Israeli-Palestinian conflicts (chapters 6 and 8) using his 4GW framework.

US	52977415	R1I7K3S40P0N9V	0060005688	267833178	The Paradox of Choice: Why More Is Less	Books	5	9	11	N	N	An insightful framework in how we make decisions.	This is an excellent book.  The author makes some pretty earth shaking assertions, but being a scientist he supports them well with studies he either performed himself or by referring to the ones of other scientists.  The book is very easy and fun to read.  By reading it, you will learn much about yourself, your friends, society and business in general.<br /><br />The author's framework includes several dimensions.  The first one is that good feelings about good decisions weight much less on our psyche than negative ones associated with bad decisions.  Thus, people are more sensitive to losses than gains.  Let's say you bought a good soap and a bad shampoo.  You would think you could call it even; but apparently most of us can't.  We are a lot more bummed out about the bad shampoo than we are excited about the good soap.<br /><br />The second dimension is the number of choices.  The more choices we have, the more likely we are to make a poor choice, and the more aggravated we will get about that poor choice [because there were so many more superior alternatives].  Meanwhile, if we do make a good choice our satisfaction level will not increase as a result of having more choices.  The author indicates that good feelings satiate; meanwhile bad feelings escalate.  Thus, the number of choice compounds the power of the negative (but not the positive) feelings.<br /><br />The third dimension is the disaggregation of the population into two separate types of shoppers: the Maximizers and the Satisficers.  The Maximizers strive to always make the best choice for every single purchase they make.  As a result, they do a lot of research sometimes for the most trivial purchase.  They do research before and after a purchase.  Thus, they keep on benchmarking their purchases to all the other alternatives they had.  This mentality inevitably leads the Maximizers to eventually be dissatisfied with their purchases and question their own decision-making ability.  This leads them to doing more research, more comparison, leading to more purchase dissatisfaction.  It is a vicious cycle they may not be able to get out of.  As you can imagine, the Satisficers are just the opposite.  They are more casual about their purchasing.  They do a lot less research before making a purchase.  And, they certainly do none after making a purchase.  For them, most products are essentially equivalent commodities providing the same utility with no implication on their customer satisfaction.  Obviously, most of us are somewhat between these two extremes.  But, the author discloses an easy test whereby we can measure our tendencies towards being more like a Maximizer or a Satisficer.<br /><br />The fourth dimension is how the Maximizers and Satisficers handle life and how satisfied are they with it.  As you can imagine, Maximizers make better purchases than Satisficers.  Information and research do contribute to superior choices.  But, paradoxically the Maximizers enjoy their purchases much less than the Satisficers.  This has profound implications across many human endeavors as \\"purchase\\" is just a proxy for any serious decision we are faced with.  The author did some research on MBA students.  He found that the Maximizers got job offers that were nearly 20% higher than the Satisficers.  Yet, they were much less satisfied with these offers than the Satisficers.  Given the Maximizers tendency to continuously benchmark, they probably were also much more likely to change jobs more frequently than the Satisficers.  The author also indicated there is a high correlation between Maximizer and depression.<br /><br />Somehow, the author's work contradicts economic theory.  Economists state that the more competition you have the better; as consumers will have more choices at a lower price.  But, the author's work suggests there is a diminishing return associated with increasing choices that kicks in way sooner than economists think.  Do we really need 85 different toothpastes andsoaps?<br /><br />The author discloses many more contrarian insights that really get you thinking about who you are.  If you like this book, you will also like \\"The Cost of Living\\" he wrote in 1994, a prescient book on how most aspects of our modern day lives are increasingly affected by economics and commercial profitability considerations.  Another interesting book very similar to this one is \\"The Progress Paradox\\" by Gregg Easterbrook.toothpastes and soaps?      <br /> <br />The author discloses many more contrarian insights that really get you thinking about who you are.

I am usually a big fan of the small green series of math books.  This is the fourth one I have studied.  Thanks to these books I successfully learned on my own Logit Regression, Cluster Analysis, and Discriminant Analysis.  Now how about Factor Analysis?  Well, it is the exception that confirms the rule.<br /><br />Relative to the other books I have just mentioned, I found this one really poor.  The authors spent just four short pages at the beginning of the book on introducing in (not so) plain English what Factor Analysis is.  The problem is that their explanations are so poor, you really don't have a realistic clue of what it is.  The authors then launch into an intense core mathematical section underlying the foundation of Factor Analysis.  I found it byzantine at best.  I attempted to replicate their calculations to develop an understanding of what they were doing.  Doing so, I even found a mistake.  More often then not, they did not flesh out a clear example of the calculations.  So, you are left interpreting their formulas, and often not readily getting the same results they get.  As indicated, once I clearly confirmed that our difference was due to a mistake.  The rest of the time, I had no idea.  Just applying their formulas did not seem to always work.  In math, that is unsettling.  Being able to replicate the answer 80% of the time does not cut it.<br /><br />Also, the sequence of the material is sometimes awkward.  On one page, you often have a table about one Factor model, but a diagram about a previous Factor model.  So, the presentation of the material is confusing.<br /><br />Eventually, I studied Factor Analysis from other sources (internet and textbooks on multivariate analysis).  By now, I developed a fair understanding of it.  Based on my experience, there are ways to teach Factor Analysis in a clear and understandable way.  And, these two authors did not achieve this.  Thus, you figure why I can't recommend this book.	2004-12-11

They all have invariably been excellent.  They rely on science, medical studies, and in depth analysis.  They all do an excellent job of educating the public on the medical topics they cover.  They differentiate between the marketing hype and established science.<br /><br />The Aging Eye is an excellent reference book that outlines what happens to our eyes as they age since our mid thirties.  This is a very short 200 page book with extremely large font.  It definitely is made not to strain your eyesight. And, it reads easily in three leisurely hours.<br /><br />In nine short chapters, it covers everything you need to know.  The book explains in detail the three major diseases affecting us with the passage of time [glaucoma, macular degeneration, and cataract].  It covers also many other common and less common eye ailments.  It gives much information on prevention, treatment, surgery, post-surgery.<br /><br />My favorite chapter was the last one on how to safeguard your eyesight.  There it stresses the benefit of good living, including plenty of aerobic exercises to keep your cardiovascular system in top shape, and good nutrition based on an abundance of fresh produce (fruits and vegetables).  It also stresses the necessity to protect one's eyes from sunlight including the dreaded UVAs and UVBs sunrays.  Sunglasses need not cost a fortune, but they need to be excellent (very high % protection against UVs) and be worn virtually all the time when outdoors the minute the Sun is out.<br /><br />My favorite pages are near the end where the book dispels many myths about eyesight.  Many I must admit, I believed so far.  But, it now makes sense to me that they were actual myths.  One of them being that you can actually correct your eyesight with eye exercises.  According to the book, you really can't.  And, having tried the exercise routines to some degree, I really believe it now.<br /><br />In any case, I strongly recommend this book.  If you are interested in your general health and nutrition (extremely highly correlated to your eye health) I equally strongly recommend \\"Eat, Drink, and Be Healthy\\" by Walter Willett, and \\"The Harvard Medical School Guide to Men's Health\\" by Harvey Simon./> <br />In any case, I strongly recommend this book.

The book includes 14 chapters including the conclusion.  Each chapter can be read independently, as they follow the famed Harvard case study method.  Each chapter describes a unique issue impacting higher education.  Some of these interesting issues include: a) the advent and so far failing of online higher education; b) the success of for profit publicly traded university companies; c) the new sources of funds for universities, including copyrights and patents; d) the ongoing restructuring of undergraduate core curriculum to please the students and private industry; e) the shrinking government subsidization of public universities and their resulting de facto privatization; f) the compromising of the independence of university research when financed by the private sector; and f) various attempts to revive the liberal arts discipline within an increasingly profit driven higher education culture.<br /><br />Throughout these issues, the authors covers recurring themes.  These include the many conflict of interest between: a) intellectual culture and profits; b) professors' research activities and undergraduate teaching; c) practical job oriented education and liberal arts.<br /><br />Some of these fascinating themes beg the questions of what is knowledge? What is culture? Even what is critical thinking?  During the Renaissance the answer to such questions would include being fluent in both Latin and Greek in addition to a couple of vernacular languages.  It also entailed having an extremely developed art appreciation supported by demonstrated artistic capabilities.  A broad and deep understanding of most aspects of science was also important.  Thus, in comparison to this ideal Renaissance Mind model, we are really all a bunch of illiterates no matter how well educated we are.<br /><br />The author finishes the book by asking what will be the Latin and Greek disciplines of tomorrow.  What he means by that is what will be the dying intellectual disciplines that will not survive our practical and profit driven culture.  He ventures to offer some candidates for the intellectual cemetery, including: English literature, pure mathematics, foreign languages, maybe sociology and other liberal arts disciplines.  He mentions these with much sadness.  He does not want it to happen.  But, he suggests that the painting may be on the wall.<br /><br />The bright side of the coin is that higher education has never been so alive.  Universities attempt a cocktail of different strategies to survive and thrive.  Also, a bunch of smart institutions are attacking the higher education monopoly from all sides.  Students of all ages never had so many opportunities to acquire higher learning in so many different ways.  None of us does speak Latin and Greek anymore.  But, we all have infinite opportunities to keep on learning throughout our lives be it a certification in C++ programming, or a business or law degree from specialized institutions.  Also, online education is bound to make a come back and compound learning opportunities for all of us.  What's wrong with all that?  Not much really.<br /><br />Thus, there is a lot of food for thought in this book.  You will never think of higher education quite the same way after reading it.orrow.

This is a very short and easy to read book.  Yet, it is very informative and insightful.  I have read many books covering the same theme written by Peter Drucker, John Naisbitt, Robert Reich, and Lester Thurow among other visionaries and economists.  This one is the best on the subject for two reasons.  The two authors studied the historical data much more extensively than the others.  Also, this book is more focused.  The authors did not get sidetracked by many related economic and political issues.<br /><br />The authors extensive research dispels thoroughly the notion that computerization is bad for employment.  To the contrary, computerization has increased both the quantity and quality of jobs.<br /><br />The authors studied in detail labor trends over the past 40 years to support their conclusion.  They uncovered the prescient work of Herbert Simon, who wrote an essay in the 1960s on the change in labor mix with the advent of technologies.  The authors documented that for the most part Simon was correct.  Due to computerization, the labor mix was going to change materially over the next several decades tilted towards a greater concentration of jobs associated with greater complexity in terms of critical thinking and judgment.<br /><br />Just as Simon predicted, there is today a far greater percentage of the population involved in complex jobs associated with an intense critical thinking component.  Such jobs include managers, professionals, technicians, and many sales related activities.  By the same token, there is a far smaller percentage of the population engaged in blue collar routine work.<br /><br />As mentioned, just as the quality of jobs (greater complexity) has improved immensely during the past several decades, so as the quantity.  Between 1969 and 2000, the labor force grew by a staggering 63% from 83 million to 135 million.  And, this surge in labor occurred during the most intense computerization era.<br /><br />If we just observe the change in our own working lives, we can confirm that our job functions have changed dramatically for the better.  We all use computers with increasingly powerful hardware that can handle increasingly complex software.  In turn, the software replaces many of the routine components of our jobs.  It also gives us quick access to a math level which would have been accessible only to PhDs not long ago.  I don't think any of us would readily turn the clock back on computerization regarding our specific jobs.  The authors will convince you the same is true at the macroeconomic level.ve the change in our own working lives, we can confirm that our job functions have changed dramatically for the better.

The author's style is lively and easy to read.  He imparts much original knowledge well supported by demographics studies within a short book.<br /><br />The author uncovers many blind spots of Western geopolitics.  Contrary to the consensus, Christianity will remain more prevalent than Islam.  Jenkins studying demographics observes that the most rapidly growing countries are in Africa, Latin America, and the Middle East.  From these demographic projections, he concludes that by 2050, there still will be 50% more Christians than Muslims  due to the prevalence of Christianity in both Africa and Latin America.<br /><br />Christianity's center is moving away from the West.  In 1900, Europe, North America and the former Soviet Union (Northern Christians) represented 32% of Christians; while Africa and Latin America (Southern Christians) accounted for only 13%.  However, in 2000 the Southern Christians grew to 21%, while the Northern Christians shrank to 18%.  By 2050, the Southern Christians will account for 29% and the Northern Christians only 11%.  Astonishingly, the Southern Christians' growth accelerated after the decolonization from the West (after 1960).  This means that the Southern Christians adopted their own indigenous, independent style of Christianity.<br /><br />Christianity will become increasingly unrecognizable to the West.  The Southern Christians' religion is as different as Islam from a Western point of view.  The Southern Christianity is much more conservative, fundamentalist in beliefs and teachings.  It takes both the Old and New Testaments literally.  It retains a strong supernatural orientation associated with the possibility of miracles in current daily lives, prophecies, visions, ecstatic utterances, and healings that are supported by literal readings of the Bible.  The Southern Christians are extremely conservative, vehemently anti-abortion, against  women's rights, and intolerant towards homosexuality.  Also, they do not believe in the separation of Church and State.<br /><br />The West influence on the course of Christianity will dwindle.  The Southern Christians views do and will increasingly prevail.  Because of the demographic shifts associated with the rising predominance of Southerners, the latter's influence on Christianity is rising.  Currently, 40% of the cardinals who engage in papal election are Southerners.  This percent should rise rapidly.  Soon, the election of an African pope with extremely conservative views will be inevitable.  The progressive and secular views of Northern Christians are ignored by the Vatican.<br /><br />The Southerners' influence is not only external, but internal within Western societies.  In both Europe, and the U.S. a rising percentage of Christians are Southern Christian immigrants.  Indeed, many Africans emigrate to Europe.  They sometimes speak of the rechristianization of Europe.  Also, Latin Americans emigrate to the U.S.  This is especially true for Mexicans.  By 2050, there will be 100 million Hispanics in the U.S. (the majority being from Mexico) who will represent the third largest block of Hispanics in the World (behind Brazil and Mexico).  Thus, the type of Catholicism prevalent in the U.S. will change over the next half century.  This will be true for Protestantism too.  One of the most rapid growing religions is a derivative of Protestantism called Pentecostalism with deep roots in Latin America.  Pentecostals who have a growing presence in the U.S. are expected to number one billion by 2050.  Pentecostalism is very different than Protestantism, as it is associated with beliefs in spirits, and personal spiritual revelations that supersede Biblical authority.<br /><br />Violent clashes between Islam and Christendom will exacerbate.  Islam is going through an intolerant fanatical phase rendering conflicts with Christians more frequent and violent.  In the majority of conflicts, Muslims are the aggressors.  This trend is expected to continue. Sudan is a typical situation where Arab Muslims are killing Black Christians.  Often religious bigotry has an economic element such as in Indonesia where 2000 Chinese Christians were killed by Muslims in 1998.  The Chinese Christians belong to a mercantile class that control a good part of commerce in Indonesia.  Clashes between Muslims and Christians are likely within States that seemed evenly divided within the two (Nigeria, Ethiopia, Tanzania) where Muslims dominate but with a large Christian minority (Indonesia, Egypt, Sudan) and where Christians dominate with a large Muslim minority (Philippines, Zaire, Uganda, and Germany).  Often Muslim minorities demand changing a State's governance to Sharia Islamic Law.  This eliminates women's freedom, and typically causes civil unrest and bloodshed.  Conflagrations between the Christian Philippines and nearby Islamic Indonesia are likely.  Finally, there is the unique situation of the former Soviet Union.  Several of the former satellite States have now a strong majority of Muslims (Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan) where Muslim fundamentalists have organized guerilla campaigns.  Their goal is to create a large and rigid Islamic State in Central Asia.  Thus, Christian Orthodox Russia could find itself surrounded by Islamic states.  Thus, the Chechnya situation could become one among many as conflicts between Central Asian Muslims and Russia expand through the region.<br /><br />Traditional allegiance between the West and Southern Christianity will be severely tested.  This is true for several reasons.  The first one is that the West will feel progressively estranged from the conservative anti-secular Christianity practiced by the Third World where these clashes occur.  Secondly, Western liberals are uncomfortable taking stands against Islam.  Thirdly, Islam includes many OPEC members that provide oil to the West.  This handcuffs the West from taking strong stand against many Islamic states (Saudi Arabia being one).  Because of all these reasons, the West may often support the Muslim side against the Christian one.  In other words, the West because of both religious and political reasons will sometimes find itself engaged in cultural wars against Christianity.sors.  This trend is expected to continue.

This handcuffs the West from taking strong stand against many Islamic states (Saudi Arabia being one).  Because of all these reasons, the West may often support the Muslim side against the Christian one.  In other words, the West because of both religious and political reasons will sometimes find itself engaged in cultural wars against Christianity.	2004-11-07

This is a fascinating book for a narrowly targeted audience.  If you are engaged in any way in the governance of a homeowner association either as property manager, lawyer, or board member, this book is most interesting.<br /><br />The author outlines in detail the history of the advent of common interest developments (CIDs) in the U.S.  He explains why this form of residential ownership has taken on like wildfire in the past four decades.  And, what this imply for society at large and local governments in particular.<br /><br />The author indicates that there were only 500 homeowner associations in 1964; but, there were more than 150,000 in 1992.  Nowadays, a significant percentage of the middle class and upper middle class lives in such associations.  The factors that drove this explosion in the number of CIDs are:<br /><br />1) Land economics.  Developers were able to significantly increase the unit and population density within their housing developments.  This increased the supply of private housing, and lowered their costs, making them affordable to a much larger segment of the population.<br /><br />2) Lower municipalities costs.  As CIDs maintain a good part of their infrastructure and also finance some of their municipal services, municipalities' revenues went up due to rising property taxes.  But, their costs did not grow as much.<br /><br />The author makes an eloquent case that the local governments' acceptance of CIDs to boost their revenues more than their cost was a Faustian deal.  This is because the middle and upper middle class is becoming increasingly disenfranchised from the remainder of the community.  If they are well taken care off by the private services they pay for through monthly assessments within their gated communities or condominium, they will become increasingly resentful of paying regular property taxes, and voting for parcel taxes, and local bonds to finance public services they don't use.  The author mentioned that a few CIDs have already successfully obtained the right to tax rebates on a proportion of their property taxes to avoid \\"double taxation\\" for the same services.  The liberal economist, Robert Reich, has depicted this phenomenon as the \\"secession of the successful.\\"<br /><br />The author is also deeply troubled with the governance of CIDs.  He feels like Boards have way too much power on the private lives of homeowners.  He thinks that developers have way too much influence on the shape of U.S. communities.<br /><br />The author also depicts the shameful history of CIDs as being racists.  They did it  through their implementation of restrictive covenants forbidding ownership by any racial minorities to supposedly maintain property values.  This went on until the Supreme Court deemed such covenants unenforceable in 1948.<br /><br />For my part, I find some dissonance in some of the author's arguments.  Are the CIDs such a dark development within U.S. society.  I don't think so.  First, the level of racial discrimination implemented within CIDs prior to 1948 was not specific to just CIDs.  Such racial discrimination clause must have been frequent within apartments' lease agreements, and other forms of housing.  In other words, there is a reason why the Judiciary passed a body of laws to forbid racial discrimination within housing, employment, and other aspects of our private or public lives.  The author sees a cause and effect here.  I don't.  I see it as a simultaneous development.  We all shared the same sins at the same time, whether we lived in CIDs or not.<br /><br />The argument of the \\"secession of the successful\\" is open to contradictory facts.  There is no doubt that CIDs by increasing population density on developed land, lowered the cost of private housing, and significantly boosted the homeownership rate over the past decades.  Thus, CIDs have not become housing for the few but for the many.  If it was not for CIDs, the homeownership rate in the U.S. would be far lower.  Additionally, the author's prophecy that an increasing number of CIDs would lobby and obtain property tax rebates has not occurred a full decade later.  There is a simple reason for that.  The majority of CIDs do not come even close to fully substituting local municipal services with their own privatized services.  As treasurer of a condominium, I know that the only true municipal service we pay for through our monthly assessment is garbage removal.  And, this cost accounts for only 6% of our budget.  This is not significant enough for us to petition City Hall for a proportional tax rebate of our property taxes.<br /><br />Despite my differing views, I found this book very informative and interesting.  Thus, I strongly recommend it.  If you are interested in such issues, I also strongly recommend another book, with a broader scope: \\"Paradise Lost: California's Experience, America's Future\\" by Peter Schrag.  It raises many common issues with this book.

This is a very interesting book with two main themes.  The first one is a biography of James Wolfensohn, the President of the World Bank since 1995.  The second one is about the inner workings of the World Bank, a not so well understood institution.  The author covers both themes equally well.<br /><br />James Wolfensohn comes across as a brilliant and irascible complex character.  He exudes charm, vision, and eloquence in the outside world towards NGOs, other governmental institutions, States, and the Media.  In this capacity, he is not unlike Bill Clinton.  On the inside, he is a tyrannical, terrorizing manager displaying frequent tantrums to get the cultural changes and the results he wants  from his staff.  Here this boss from hell comes across more like a John McEnroe loosing it on a tough line call.<br /><br />The author's description of the World Bank is equally interesting.  At first, the Bank comes across as an autocratic institution which knows what is best for the country it lends to.  Invariably, the solution to all the World's problem according to the Bank are mega projects where private consultants and Western companies make a ton of money, the Bank books huge loans, but the country in question can ill afford.  Under Wolfensohn influence, the Bank has become more sensitive to the environmental and cultural impact of its financing activities.  This is in part due to the Bank opening up a dialogue with NGOs.  In this regard, Wolfensohn tenure at the Bank seemed to have been rather successful, as it has radically changed the culture of the Bank.<br /><br />In view of the above, I strongly recommend this book.  If you are interested about economics, institutions, and policy, I also recommend a couple of excellent books.  These include \\"A Term at the Fed\\" by Lawrence Meyer.  This book uncovers Alan Greenspan's management style, and the inner workings of the Federal Reserve (another not so well understood institution).  The other book is the excellent \\"In an Uncertain World\\" by Robert Rubin, the brilliant former Secretary of the Treasury under Bill Clinton.llent \\"In an Uncertain World\\" by Robert Rubin, the brilliant former Secretary of the Treasury under Bill Clinton.	2004-10-17

This books attempts to be:<br /><br />1) A college selection and admission guide;<br /><br />2) A self help manual on how to thrive during your college years;<br /><br />3) A financial planning guide focused on how to finance college;<br /><br />4) A guide to college majors; and<br /><br />5) A career counseling guide<br /><br />This is four books too many.  The author was clearly not able to handle this All-in-One formula.  He should have focused on the first theme: a regular college selection and admission guide.  This is a complex enough material for most authors and readers.<br /><br />As a result of the author's strategy of Jack-of-all-trades but Masters of none, he really failed at covering any of the five topics mentioned in adequate depth.  The book for the most part is devoid of any insights beyond common sense and common knowledge.  In addition, the book is stuffed with typos, errors, and incorrect judgments.<br /><br />For instance, on page 39 and 40 the author shares a basic list of his favorite schools.  But, most of them are misclassified.  He classifies the University of Chicago as a small liberal arts college.  Meanwhile, it is a national university with masters and doctorate programs that liberal arts colleges do not have.  On page 39, he classifies Grinnell as a good liberal arts college for B students.  On the next page, he classifies the exact same school as a good school for unconventional students with a GPA of A.  Well, is Grinnell a school for A or B students?  The author does not know.<br /><br />An example of poor judgment is his unqualified promotion of using the Common Application for convenience.  If you want to get into a selective school, don't use the Common Application; it will clearly lower your chance of getting accepted.  The school will perceive you as too lazy to even make the effort to use the school's customized application format.<br /><br />Later, he promotes Canadian schools as a superior college education at a below market cost.  This is a mirage.  First, Canadian schools are for the most part huge (20,000 to 40,000 plus students).  Their standard class size is often 100+.  Their student/teacher multiple is way higher than anything you see in the U.S.  Also, their out-of-country tuition has skyrocketed lately, and is often much higher than out-of-state tuition for public schools.  In summary, Canadian schools don't compare well in both cost and quality vs. good public school systems like the UCs and University of Michigan.<br /><br />He gives completely wrong advice on Early Action.  He discourages it because he thinks the admission standard is tougher than for regular admission.  He is wrong.  Applying Early Action gives you the equivalent of a 70-point boost on the old SAT scale.  For confirmation, check the excellent book \\"The Early Admission Game.\\"<br /><br />He overstates the case for community colleges.  He states they have better professors and smaller classes than four-year institutions.  Based on feedback from friends who did go to community colleges this is never the case.  Community colleges are a wonderful opportunity for students who have no other opportunities for financial or academic reasons.  But, they are no great shake for too many other people.<br /><br />The Appendix B, a list of 434 colleges is useless.  It is like a phone book list that is not even in alphabetical order.  Additionally, based on all the mistakes he made on his short list on page 39 and 40, I would not even trust he got the name and phone numbers right of the respective schools he mentions.  This list is associated with no qualitative information or insight whatsoever.  You have no idea if he really likes or recommends them.  There is also no information to truly differentiate them except for location and estimated costs.<br /><br />His sections on career counseling and school majors are so poor they are almost laughable.<br /><br />The author's main message, lost in a sea of errors, is that thecollege fit and what you will study and do in college are far more important than the college brand name.  This is a true and laudable message.  Unfortunately, many authors have already said it in a much more informative and convincing way than he did.  These include the following ones who wrote excellent books that I do recommend:<br /><br />Jay Matthews \\"Harvard Schmarvard\\"<br /><br />Howard and Matthew Greene, \\"The Public Ivies,\\" \\"Inside the Top Colleges,\\" and \\"The Hidden Ivies.\\"<br /><br />Loren Pope, \\"Looking Beyond the Ivy League.\\"he college fit and what you will study and do in college are far more important than the college brand name.

He criticizes all its components, including CAPM, the Efficient Market Hypothesis, and the Black Scholes model as being flawed.  All these theories rely on two main assumptions.  The first one is that market prices are normally distributed.  The author, using price charts, demonstrates that market prices do not follow a normal distribution; but instead a Cauchy distribution.  Such a distribution is associated with fatter tails.  This means that catastrophic drop in market prices happen more frequently than a normal distribution suggests.  The second assumption of modern finance is that market prices are independent of each other.  Yesterday's prices have no influence on today's.  The author makes a case that even if prices are not correlated, their volatility is correlated over time.  Thus, big price swings tend to cluster.  If a stock moved by 10% yesterday, it is likely it will move by an above average amount today even if we don't know the direction of that change.  He calls this correlation of volatility (instead of price) long-term dependence.<br /><br />Because the two main assumptions of modern finance are flawed, all related models are flawed as they understate risk.  If such models understate risk, they actually overprice stocks and underprice options, and also understate the capital financial institutions should hold to withstand market risk.<br /><br />If the author had stopped there, I would have given him a 5 rating.  However, such a rebuttal of finance theory would make no more than a great essay.  Instead, he attempts to build an entirely different edifice of modern finance over 300 pages.  And, his theoretical foundation lacks any robustness.  That's why I call it a castle of cards.<br /><br />Mandelbrot builds his edifice of modern finance on two new parameters that would replace the mean return and volatility of return or standard deviation (mean and standard deviation being the parameters defining a normal distribution).  His first parameter is Alpha, derived from Pareto's Law, is an exponent that measures how wildly prices vary.  It defines how fat the tails of the price change curve are.  The second one, the H Coefficient, borrowed from a hydrologist named Hurst, is an exponent that measures the dependence of price changes upon past changes.<br /><br />Well, what is wrong with these two measures?  He confesses at the end of the book that no two individuals calculate the same Alpha and H Coefficient when using the exact same historical data!  Apparently, there is no one established way to calculate these two parameters.  The divergence between the various methodologies can be huge.  Using one method, you could derive Alpha and H coefficients that suggest a stock is not risky, using another method you would reach the opposite conclusion.  So, after reading nearly 300 pages of intense theories you get that their own foundations are at this stage nonexistent.  If Alpha and H are mathematically not replicable and well defined, you can't apply his multifractal geometry model in any meaningful way.<br /><br />It will be up to someone else to build upon Mandelbrot's work and render it applicable to investment management by firming up the algorithms to calculate Alpha and the H Coefficient.  Only then, will fractal geometry maybe turn out into a feasible challenge to the foundation of Modern Finance.  But, at this stage contrary to what Mandelbrot pretends, it is not.<br /><br />If you are interested in investment and finance theory, I strongly recommend other books such as: Robert Shiller's \\"Irrational Exuberance\\" and \\"Market Volatility.\\"  Also, Nicholas Taleb's \\"Fooled by Randomness\\" is very good.  Also, Roger Lowenstein's \\"When Genius Failed: The Rise and Fall of Long Term Capital Management.\\"  This last book is a fascinating account of why a hedge fund failed because it relied excessively on the normal distribution, and used time series that were way too short when building its pricing models.d used time series that were way too short when building its pricing models.         <br />	2004-10-04

This is an excellent practice and teaching guide to the PSAT.  It provides you all the information you need to succeed at the new PSAT.  It gives you strategies that take advantage of the test structure such as when is it worth to guess or not, and in what specific sections.  Given the structure of the PSAT, it also shows you how to best manage your time.  It also shows you when the PSAT is more likely to set traps (an easy answer that looks right at a quick glance, but that is wrong).  The book also gives you enough material such as in the math appendix to quickly teach yourself the math you need so you will test well.  This is especially important for the sophomores who are taking the test, and will obviously not have learned the entire math being covered by the PSAT.<br /><br />The book also provides three full-length PSAT practice exams.  Anyone who has the discipline to read and study a good part of this book (including the math sections) and do at least one of the book's practice exams is bound to do a lot better on the PSAT then if they had not prepared at all for this test.  Sadly enough, the great majority of PSAT test takers do not practice at all for this important exam.  Well, this puts the rest of us who do practice at a marked competitive advantage.

The book addresses the cultural and economics differences between Europe and the U.S.  And, on all counts it favors Europe.  In reality (not in a \\"Dream\\") this is a far more complex debate.<br /><br />The author observes that Americans and Europeans are at opposite extreme of the Equality vs. Opportunity axis.  Europeans have chosen equality.  Their governments have extensive welfare safety net including very generous unemployment benefits, retirement benefits, and state sponsored healthcare.  They have strong government institution and services, and typically a strong secondary education system.  Obviously, such governmental generosities are not free.  These have been associated with cripplingly high tax rates and government regulations.  As you know, the U.S. is just at the opposite of the spectrum. In relative terms, the U.S. safety net is stingy, and the money invested in secondary education is low.  So, in the U.S. forget equality but embrace opportunity.  As a result, the U.S. has still the best entrepreneurship climate.  At every turn, the author finds European Equality more enlightened than American Opportunity.  But one could easily arrive at the opposite conclusion.<br /><br />One of the author's strongest points is the degree of religiosity vs. secularism.  The author comes at the surprising and correct conclusion that most European countries are more secular than the U.S.  Regarding such issues as stem cell research, abortion, euthanasia, the Europeans are far more secular.  Their governments interfere much less with scientific developments in genetics, women's control of their bodies, and how individuals choose to pass away.  In the U.S., a prevailing conservative far right catholic bias often prevents the government from dealing with these issues.  Unless the U.S. wakes up out of its own Middle Aged-like catholic mindset, it will experience a brain drain of geneticists moving to Europe.<br /><br />But, is the U.S. deemed to fall behind in every respect vs. Europe.  The author attempts to make this case through carefully chosen selective statistics.  He suggests that the productivity per worker per hour of certain few chosen European countries is fractionally higher than the ones for their American counterparts.  This is really meaningless.  If you selected the highest productivity per worker per hour of the top three States, you would observe they may be 20% higher than the average European productivity level.  This seems like a ridiculous apples and oranges argument.  But, that is exactly what the author has done (in the opposite direction of course).  There are other reasons why this statistic is misleading.  It ignores the respective unemployment levels and the number of hours worked.  Europeans have an unemployment level twice as high as the U.S. and their workers work 20% less.  When you compare Europe and the U.S. on the more meaningful statistics: GDP growth per capita, and overall labor productivity growth, the U.S. leaves Europe in the dust.  The US GDP per capita is already 50% greater than Europeans ($36K vs. $24K).  And, this gap is growing rapidly.<br /><br />Why is the U.S. leaving Europe in the dust.  It is due to the dark side of European Equality.  European Equality comes at a price associated with a negative stifling business climate associate with high tax rates and strangulating government regulations.  As a result, Europeans struggle to develop a dynamic small business sector which creates most of the jobs in the U.S.  Similarly, the overly generous unemployment benefits make it extremely costly for employers to hire.  As a result, they don't.  That is why Europe is and will always have a chronically high unemployment rate.<br /><br />Demographics also strongly favors the U.S.  The U.S. has a much higher fertility rate and immigration rate than Europe.  Thus,  European societies are already much older and aging far more rapidly than Americans.  Also, Europe has far more generous elderly benefits.  Thus, the fiscal crisis associated with elderly government benefits is far more serious in Europe.  It represents a handicap for Europeans regarding capital formation, job creation, and overall economic growth going forward.  In other words, the gap between the U.S. and Europe growth in GDP per capita is deemed to accelerate.<br /><br />In conclusion, the European Dream is just a dream.  It has little to do with reality.  For a much more objective analysis of comparative economic and demographic data I strongly recommend the two excellent books by Robert Stowe England: \\"Global Aging and Financial Markets\\" and \\"The Fiscal Challenge of an Aging Industrial World.\\"generous elderly benefits.

Most likely, if you are reading this review you have experienced this incredibly stubborn ailment (toenail fungus), which affects millions of aging baby boomers.  The author explains in detail what this ailment is; and how Penlac (topical) and Lamisil (oral) prescriptions work.  And, most importantly he describes a unique strategy on how to better utilize these weapons against toenail fungus.<br /><br />His rather brilliant strategy is something that no podiatrist knows about.  He noticed based on his firsthand experience that Penlac works very well on the tip of the toenail, but not the bed and matrix of the toe.  Meanwhile, Lamisil's performance is exactly the reverse.  He also noted that the recommended dosage for Penlac is overkill.  You don't need to lacquer your toes twice a day.  You can get just as good results by doing it just a few times a week.  Similarly, he thinks the Lamisil standard length of dosage (3 months) is way too short.  It should be longer.  The only reason the standard prescription is so short is to reduce the liability risk associated with the very low risk that Lamisil may cause liver malfunction.  For healthy people, this drug is actually very safe.<br /><br />So, by using a lower frequency of Penlac applications combined with an extended period of Lamisil, he completely cured his toes from toenail fungus.  Meanwhile, when he tried Lamisil and Penlac on a stand-alone basis; they both failed.<br /><br />If you are a toenail fungus sufferer, you owe it to yourself to read this book.  You will find so much unique well-explained information.  His strategy will give you a new cure that has a much higher percentage success than using Lamisil alone.  He uncovered studies in France and Germany that corroborated most of his findings.	2004-09-02

This is an excellent book.  The book is short and very well written.  As a result, it reads as easily and quickly as just a few long articles from a tennis magazine.  It is a lot more than just a rebuttal to McEnroe's book \\"You Can't Be Serious.\\"  McEnroe's book, although greatly entertaining was pretty much about McEnroe and not much more.  Given whom McEnroe is, that still made for fascinating stuff.  This book is not so much about Bill Scanlon, an extremely talented but unknown name outside tennis.  Nor is it so much about McEnroe.  It is much more about what Scanlon describes as the Golden Era of tennis (70s and 80s) in which he was privileged to participate.<br /><br />Scanlon, in the shadows of the titans of the sport, had an incredible career that crossed paths with most of the superstars of the modern era.  When he got started, he faced a mature Ilea Nastase (10 years his elder).  Near his twilight, he faced the new teenage wonder - Andre Agassi.  In between, he played against all the demi gods of the games, including Borg, Vilas, Connors, McEnroe, Gerulaitis, Lendl, and even the younger generation of near mythological characters: Becker, Edberg, Wilander.<br /><br />This book is extremely insightful.  The chapters about the fights for the control and governance of the game between the WTC, MIPTC, and the emerging ATP are fascinating.  Some of these absurd fights culminated back in 1973, when 79 players boycotted Wimbledon, and Jan Kodes, an athletic East European better known for his clay court performances won Wimbledon due to a truly impoverished men's draw.<br /><br />Chapter 4 on equipment is also very interesting.  It discloses how in the late seventies and early eighties modern graphite racquets took the tennis world by storm.  This caused a near crisis for most of the existing stars whose game had been developed with wood racquets.  Scanlon shared that none of these stars adapted well to the change.  And, this included both McEnroe and himself.  The oversized stiffer racquets facilitated the modern power game that left touch players behind.<br /><br />Scanlon noticed that while Nastase's tantrums affected his results, McEnroe's tantrums helped his.  McEnroe's tantrums were well timed just to break an opponent's hot streak.  More often than not, McEnroe's tantrum strategy worked.  It allowed him to regain his footing in a match and beat his opponent.  Thus, contrary to what McEnroe suggested in his own books, that is tantrums were outbursts of his own angered perfectionism; Scanlon suggests they represented an unfair strategy to beat opponents.  I have little doubt that Scanlon is right.  Thus, while McEnroe's theatrics were often hugely entertaining for the crowds, they must have represented a real pain in the neck for all his tennis opponents.<br /><br />There is also a lot of entertaining stuff, including the exploits of Vitas Gerulaitis with the ladies.  This is one aspect that both McEnroe and Scanlon books have in common.  Both players/authors were quite awed by the amount of energy Vitas could exhibit on and off the tennis courts.  Apparently, Vitas could easily handle a near sleepless night and win the Australian Open the next day.  I am not so sure he could do that today.  Marat Safin and Mark Phillippoussis are trying Vitas hedonistic route to success.  But, so far they have frittered away their respective immense talent.  And, they are both running out of time.<br /><br />The book includes many more themes and topics equally interesting to the few I described above.  If you like tennis, you'll love this book.  I obviously have to also recommend McEnroe's \\"You cannot be serious.\\"  It is an excellent book too, even though it is narrower in scope than this one.elf.

Marat Safin and Mark Phillippoussis are trying Vitas hedonistic route to success.  But, so far they have frittered away their respective immense talent.  And, they are both running out of time. <br /> <br />The book includes many more themes and topics equally interesting to the few I described above.  If you like tennis, you'll love this book.  I obviously have to also recommend McEnroe's \\"You cannot be serious.\\"  It is an excellent book too, even though it is narrower in scope than this one. <br />	2004-08-31

This is an excellent and detailed portrayal of Osama bin Laden.  It is like his biography so far.  Being in his late forties, Osama is still relatively young, and if he survives his dangerous lifestyle as being the most wanted fugitive in the Western World, he could still achieve a lot more than he has so far.  Given his line of work, this is a frightening thought.<br /><br />Randal has conducted detailed research, that allowed him to portray a thorough psychological character profile of Osama from his childhood to nowadays.  Contrary to what might be expected, in Randal's portrayal of Osama one sees a very capable, calculating, intelligent, and charismatic leader.  He also outlines the social and historical circumstances that allowed Osama to become the defacto supranational leader of terrorist networks, giving him a certain kind of power that is second to none.<br /><br />Randal covers how the House of Saud supported and promoted Osama to become a leading fundraiser to mount a guerrilla effort against the Russians in Afghanistan.  We know that the CIA also helped out in setting up some of the training camps in Afghanistan to fight off the Russians.  With the support of both the House of Saud and the U.S. the Jihadis succeeded beautifully and beat back the Russians in Afghanistan.  But, both Saudi Arabia and the U.S. at the time in the eighties did not suspect they had created a Scorpio that would use his newly found stinging power to hurt them both [Saudi Arabia and the U.S.].<br /><br />Randal describes how Osama became a superstar of the freedom fighting set of the Islamic World long before 9/11.  Dubious achievements such as the masterminding of the bombing of several American embassies throughout Africa in the nineties turned Osama into a rock star so to speak within the Jihad aficionados nearly a decade before he became a household name in the U.S.<br /><br />Randal also engages in a broader topic covering the weaknesses that the U.S. has in dealing with the Islamic insurrection.  These weaknesses include a lack of contacts, intelligence, linguistic and cultural knowledge that would allow the infiltration of Islamic terrorist networks at the local level.  In other words, Osama and his subordinates have a far easier time infiltrating the open societies of Western countries than the reverse.<br /><br />Randal does not offer easy solutions on how to deal with the Osama threat.  He recognizes that both Saudi Arabia and the U.S. have so far floundered in dealing with it.  Randal does not see any quick success in controlling Al Qaeda.<br /><br />Nevertheless, if you want to better understand and know who is Osama, and broaden your knowledge regarding the Islamic insurrection and their related terrorist networks; this is an excellent book that makes a valid contribution to the already abundant literature on the subject.ealing with the Islamic insurrection.

This is the most difficult book I have ever finished.  It moves in a chaotic 1-step forward 2 steps back pattern.  It is difficult to extract the main themes.  The author did not exercise coherent synthesis of the main facts.  The author overwhelms with so much details; it is challenging to distinguish trivia from turning points.  I read most books in a week.  It took me six to read this one.  To make sense of it, I wrote 44 pages of notes and did research the main treaties on the Wikipedia website.  I recommend this book only to readers with an intense interest and academic knowledge of the subject.  Without these assets, finishing and making sense of this book will be most challenging.<br /><br />In few words here is what I got.  Britain was the main player regarding the 1914 to 1922 period of ongoing conflicts with the Ottoman Empire.  But, during this time it experienced the turnover of three different governments who had radically different views about the break up of the Ottoman Empire.  In the first period, 1914 to 1916, Britain's objective was to reign in the advance from Russia that was pressing southward through Afghanistan.  Britain's concern was to maintain the safety of its vulnerable trading route through the Middle East to India.  To do so, Britain was willing to grant significant territories to France (Sykes - Picot Agreement of 1916), to create a buffer against further Russian expansion.  By 1918, a change in government results in a change in foreign policy.  Britain's goal now is its hegemony over how much of the Ottoman territory it can claim.  This caused Britain to renege on the Sykes - Picot Agreement, and experience continued diplomatic tension with France, especially regarding who will occupy Syria.  In the later stage (1920 to 1922), Britain suffered from imperial overstretch.  It did not have the resources to hang on to the territories it claimed just a couple of years ago.  It becomes clear that the British Mandates over Middle Eastern territories will be a difficult and costly experience.  Also, the public and British press are dead set against Britain's Middle Eastern occupation.<br /><br />The British Government supported Zionism for a couple of reasons.  First, early in the War the Government believed that the Jews may well support the Central Powers if Germany steps to the plate first in its support of Zionism.  Thus, the Brits viewed it as a race to gain the support of the Jewish community both in Europe and the U.S. by offering their political support of the Zionist cause (Balfour Declaration of 1917 is a late stage confirmation of British support).  Later, Britain, and more particularly Churchill strongly supported Zionism for another perceived threat.  And, that is that Jews would emigrate and join Bolshevik Russia.  From Britain's perspective, it was far more advantageous to promote Jewish emigration to Palestine, then watch Jewish emigration swell the Bolshevik ranks.  Ironically, Churchill did the most to undermine Zionism, by promoting the cutting off 75% of Palestine territory (Transjordan), which became Jordan, an independent country who rejected Palestinian refugees just as egregiously as the future state of Israel.<br /><br />What is clear is that the restructuring of the Ottoman Empire into the modern Middle East was a chaotic process.  During the 1914 - 1922 period, it was dominated by a dozen conflicting treaties between different countries.  The most notorious was the Sykes - Picot Agreement between France and Britain, which was signed in 1916 in secret two full years before the end of the War.  This Agreement was agreed, and rebutted by Britain so many times; it gets your head spinning.  However, it seemed that its terms directionally prevailed when the Middle Eastern Mandates were offered by the League of Nations to France and Britain.<br /><br />This period caused incredible economic stress on many countries.  Both Russia and Turkey experienced food shortages and increase in prices of over 1,000% between the beginning and end of the War.  Britain experienced a severe economic crisis that caused it to become increasingly dependent on American capital.<br /><br />The Ottoman Empire was in a self-destructing state way before the War.  It was also actively split during the War since the Turks joined the Germans, and most of the Arab areas joined Britain (associated with the stories and tales of Lawrence of Arabia).<br /><br />There were no right or wrong ways to create the various countries.  Given communities of Sunnis, Shiites, Wahabists, Kurds who do not cohabitate well, either you respected the various groups separate identities.  This would engender inter State wars.  Or, you would create states with a mix of these different communities.  And, that would create civil unrest and wars.  The Middle East has experienced its fair share of both types of conflicts.<br /><br />The author interestingly concludes that the ongoing formation of the different Middle Eastern governments is a process that may last over a millennium.  He compares the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire and the onset of the formation of various Middle Eastern governments to the dissolution of the Roman Empire in the fourth century, and the ultimate crystallization of West European governments after WWII, or over a millennium and a half later.increase in prices of over 1,000% between the beginning and end of the War.

It's main theme is that both Democrat and Republican Administrations are equally fiscally irresponsible.  Even the rare Budget Surpluses generated during the Clinton Administration were really a mirage.  If the Government had to report its fiscal condition just as publicly held companies report their financial condition to the SEC, the Government would be deemed insolvent.  This is not so much due to the yearly Budget Deficits, but much more so due to the negative net present value of the net cost of the Social Security and Medicare programs (social security taxes minus Social Security and Medicare claims).  This huge cost is due to the demographic forces of an aging society.  As a metaphor, this is as if IBM's pension plan was so underfunded that it's negative present value that IBM had to report on its balance sheet would cause IBM's net worth to be negative.  This is not what you see with Government stealthy accounting.  But, that is what the true fiscal condition of the Government looks like.<br /><br />Among Peterson's solutions, he proposes a severe restructuring of Social Security and Medicare programs.  It entails painful decisions.  But, it is inevitable.  The Government behind close doors is currently talking about such restructuring.  One of the main issues is what is the age cut-off for the grandfathering of existing benefits.  Government leaks suggest the age cut-off considered is between 50 and 55.  This means that if you are of this age or older, the Government will not touch your benefit.  But, if you are younger they will be curtailed.<br /><br />I have read interesting rebuttals to this overall fiscal storm argument.  Many experts view that Peterson over dramatizes the situation.  One argument suggests that higher labor productivity will decrease the impact somewhat.  This is true, but it is very relative.  Meaning higher productivity may help, but not nearly as much as to avoid the perfect fiscal storm.  The other rebuttal suggests that the problem is not so much an aging population but a U.S. health care system with out of control cost.  Our health care system may engulf both the Government and the private sector's financial condition.  I think this is an excellent argument.  But, it does nothing to truly exclude the other.  In other words, we still do have a fiscal storm associated with an aging population.  And, we also do have a healthcare system that is putting increasing pressure on both the public and private sector resources.  In summary, none of these arguments truly affect the importance of Peterson's message.<br /><br />In view of the above, this is an important book for anyone to read regardless of your age.  On the same subject, I also strongly recommend Laurence Kotlikoff's \\"The Coming Generational Storm.\\"  I also recommend the two excellent books by Robert Stowe England: \\"Global Aging and Financial Markets\\" and \\"The Fiscal Challenge of an Aging Industrial World.\\"  Robert Stowe England's books not only give a detailed perspective of the upcoming fiscal stress on the U.S. due to an aging population, but, he also analyses this situation with many other industrialized countries.  It makes for fascinating read.  Thus, if you are interested in this pressing subject there is much material worth exploring beyond Peterson's.  But, Peterson's book is a mighty good introduction.storm.   The other rebuttal suggests that the problem is not so much an aging population but a U.S. health care system with out of control cost.

This is the second tennis drill book I have read, and this one is slightly better.  The 100 drills are explained in the most efficient and concise way possible.  In tennis, a picture is worth a thousand words.  And, the author understands that perfectly well.  Almost every single drill is clearly illustrated which greatly enhances your understanding of what that specific drill is about.<br /><br />The author covers all the tennis drill situations you would encounter, single, threesome, doubles, and groups.<br /><br />I am a former college player.  I have played, watched, and studied tennis all my life.  But, I probably knew only half of the drills mentioned in this book.  In other words, this book taught me a lot of skills I could focus on practicing on the tennis court to improve my game.  In tennis, there is no finish line.  You are never too good.  But, this book will help you get as good as you can or want to get, and have a lot of fun doing it.  I strongly recommend it.	2004-08-06

I belong to a very quantitatively oriented in-house think tank of a major West Coast financial service institution.  As a very regular MBA, I often wonder what I am doing in such a group.  These little green books have bailed me out several times and provided me the understanding on various esoteric advanced statistical methods.  Thanks to these books I taught myself Logistic Regression, and Discriminant Analysis.<br />About two weeks ago, one of our best Russian mathematicians left our group.  He had developed an expertise in Cluster Analysis.  My boss assigned me to become his successor as a Cluster Analyst so to speak.  If it were not for the green book series, I would have been in a state of panic.  I quickly ordered the Cluster Analysis book.  Studied it.  And, now I am on my way to becoming a descent Cluster Analyst.<br />There are many eccentric features to Cluster Analysis.  First, it is much less well grounded in mathematics and statistics than many other data analysis methods.  For one thing, it was invented by biologists at first and further developed by many soft scientists of all kinds.  The authors reflect this strange background of Cluster Analysis.  One of them is a professor in anthropology, and the other a professor in clinical psychology.  Somehow, these soft-scientists have a much greater need to classify their data (this is especially true of biologists) than pure mathematicians do.  Second, there are tons of different ways to conduct Cluster Analysis.  All have their benefits, and some have specific flaws.  The authors do an excellent job at explaining and differentiating these different methods.<br />As usual [of the green book series], the book is very well written, and makes this complex methodology easily accessible.  It is an excellent book to teach you Cluster Analysis.  I strongly recommend it.<br />Cluster Analysis is a good thing to know.  These days it is popping out everywhere.

William Bernstein is an excellent economics and business writer. Bernstein has the ability to teach and write about technical concepts in the most accessible way.  \\"The Birth of Plenty\\" is no exception.  This book covers such a breadth of subjects regarding economics, political science, history from the antiquity to nowadays.<br /><br />His theory is not unique.  The countries who prosper are the ones who give their citizen the right to own their property, to communicate freely with each other, to practice the scientific method to replace outdated traditional knowledge, and to take business risk with other people's money.  In summary, the countries who prosper are the ones who allow individuals to reap the fruits of their risk-taking efforts.  These are not new and original ideas.<br /><br />After all, there is a long list of economics writers who pretty much said the same thing starting with Adam Smith back in 1776 in the \\"Wealth of Nations.\\"  More recently,  Hernando de Soto wrote about the exact same subject in \\"The Mystery of Capital: Why Capitalism triumphs in the West and fails everywhere else.\\"  Also, David Landes' book \\"The Wealth and Poverty of Nations: Why Some are So Rich and Some So Poor\\" adopts the exact same theory as Bernstein's.  My list could go on an on.  This is because it is a subject that fascinates and never gets exhausted.<br /><br />Even though all the above books are excellent and some are true classics in comparative international economics, Bernstein's book shines because it is so much more readable, accessible, and entertaining to read.  While the others come across as dull economics professors, Bernstein comes across as an incredibly lively journalist.  He turns his treaty on economics history into a real page turner giving David Browne's \\"Da Vinci Code\\" a run for his money [in the page turning department].  Thus, by reading this book you will learn just as much if not more than the other books I have mentioned, and you will have so much more fun.	2004-07-15

This is an excellent book that demonstrates that prostate cancer is mainly a nutritional disease.  We in the West have a far higher prostate cancer rate than our Asian counterparts.  And, it is due to diet, not ethnicity, or genes.  When Asians emigrate to our shores and adopt our Western diet (rich in animal saturated fat), their prostate cancer rates immediately rises up to our levels.<br />The author extensively details how to restructure our Western diet so as to prevent and cure prostate cancer.  This entails reducing our intake of saturated fats, mainly red meat, but also reduce dairy products.  It also entails eating more soy in every shape or form (milk, tofu, soy powder).  The author also recommends specific supplements.  Some are well known like the antioxidant vitamins (C, E).  But, others are not so well known such as Selenium, Soy proteins, among many others.<br />The author provides a lot of information about the PSA test.  He is the first to recognize that this test is not very accurate.  But, he also recommends several back up tests and benchmarks which can really enhance both the accuracy and the information value of the PSA test.  Some of these back up tests include: PSA density, Free PSA test, and ultrasound.  If you take the PSA test, and you come up with a high value (&gt;4), you ought to follow through with these other non invasive tests who may very well prevent the need for much more uncomfortable and invasive tests.<br />The author provides extensive advice on all the different options to cure prostate cancer.  On this ground, this book is excellent for several reasons.  First, every statement the author makes is referenced and well supported by scientific studies.  So, it is not just the author's opinion you are reading about.  You are getting information on current scientific knowledge.  Second, the author has gotten detailed testimonials by doctors and other individuals (including Mike Milken former king of the Junk Bond set) on how they deal with their own prostate cancer.  How they have modified their lifestyle, and nutrition, and what cure path are they taking.  This is most fascinating because there are no clearly right or wrong answers at this stage.  There are definitely multiple options on how to treat this disease, each with their own trade offs.<br />Ultimately, prostate cancer treatment is very much an individual decision.  This book can provide you much valuable information to remove most of the anxiety associated with taking some hard decisions.  In my case, it has removed a good deal of anxiety on how I can prevent this condition.  Like in anything, prevention is the best defense.  And, this book can help you do that.<br />If you are concerned about your prostate and overall health, I also strongly recommend the book &quot;The Harvard Medical School Guide To Men's Health.&quot;  It covers any ailment related to the prostate as well as many other conditions that affect the male gender.hey deal with their own prostate cancer.

The author experienced one of the most interesting terms in the history of the Federal Reserve Bank.  This is not only because of the frequent currency crisis, sovereign defaults, hedge fund bail out, stock market bubbles and crashes.  These are the usual villains.  But, it is the &quot;New Economy&quot; that became the paradigm shift in the Fed's monetary policy.<br />In essence, Alan Greenspan became convinced that the sustainable economic growth rate without causing undue inflation was substantially higher than it was in the past.  As a result, Greenspan was comfortable lowering interest rates to record low levels, and keep them there for longer than any other Fed Chairman would have dared.  Greenspan recognized that there were several factors that would keep inflation in check.  These economic forces included a secular rise in U.S. labor productivity, and deflationary forces associated with globalization and the lower cost of production in China.  It goes without saying that Greenspan was right one more time.  Unless he undertakes a major screw up between now and then, Greenspan is likely to be remembered as the best Fed Chairman we had by the time he retires at 80 years old in 2006.<br />Alan Greenspan was sometimes intellectually dictatorial in his own thinking as depicted in the previous paragraph.  This apparently frustrated the author somewhat who would have preferred a more collegiate, democratic, and open management style.  These are good points, but they are unrealistic.  The Fed Chairman has an extremely high profile.  His persona is deemed to be responsible and accountable for the largest economy in the World.  This economy is in turn the World's economic engine.  The burden of responsibility on Greenspan is enormous and falls squarely on his shoulders alone.  If he gets it wrong, he is toast.  He can't in turn blame Laurence Meyer for a Fed's mistake.  Alan Greenspan's successor will probably be as brilliant, and diplomatically dictatorial as Greenspan is.  It is just the nature of the job.<br />Even though, you get that Meyer disagreed with Greenspan on their respective reading of economic indicators and policy implications, Meyer developed much intellectual and professional respect for Greenspan.  The book is not at all the works of a disgruntled employee.  Meyer fully recognizes he worked at the Fed during a historical transition.  And, despite his occasional frustration with the job, including a lack of recognition, he most probably cherished the experience and opportunity.<br />Meyer comes across as having a high self-esteem, yet being egoless, with much humor.  In other words, he must have been an ideal colleague to work with at the Fed.  He certainly is a very good author, and has a gift for conveying complex technicalities of monetary policy in very readable and even entertaining prose.<br />If you enjoy books on economics and policy, I also strongly recommend &quot;In an Uncertain World&quot; by Robert E. Rubin, former Secretary of the Treasury under Clinton.  Rubin is also probably the top candidate to replace Greenspan in 2006, if John Kerry wins the Presidential election.a Fed's mistake.

US	52977415	RWPTZPMP32WRE	0618143726	973691975	Risk: A Practical Guide for Deciding What's Really Safe and What's Really Dangerous in the World Around You	Books	5	22	25	N	Y	This is the scientific facts without the hype.	This is an excellent book on the subject of risk analysis focused on 48 specific risks we encounter in everyday life.  The book is divided in three parts.  Part I describes mainly discretionary or behavioral risks.  These consist mainly of risks we choose to incur such as smoking, drinking alcohol, and drinking coffee.  Part II focuses on environmental risks.  These are risks that we bear, and for the most part can't avoid such as water and air pollution.  Part III describe Medical related risks.  As the authors specify these are often more outcomes than risks.  For instance, cancer and heart disease are not direct risks, they are outcome of a combination of deficient nutrition, bad lifestyle habits (lack of exercise), and inherited genes.<br />The authors make an excellent effort to come up with the most current and objective scientific knowledge.  They avoid all the hype in the media that may exaggerate or understate various risks.  After reading this excellent book, it is interesting to notice that by far the biggest risks to our health and survival are the behavioral risks or the risks we choose to undertake.  These include smoking, drinking, obesity, and also sun tanning.  These risks are far greater than pesticides, water pollution, air pollution, electro magnetic fields, and radiation from cellular phones.  Thus, the authors do a good job to strengthen our common sense based on scientific evidence instead of going crazy due to misinformation by the media.<br />The book is excellent for several reasons.  First, the authors have a solid scientific background themselves.  Second, they fully recognized that no matter how smart you are, you just can't be the number one expert in everything.  Thus, each of the chapters (dedicated to any one of the specific 48 risks) has been fully reviewed by one or more of the top authorities in the relevant field covered.  Therefore, the book does not reflect just their opinions.  In essence, each of their risk analysis has been peer-reviewed by the top specialists.  Third, they provide excellent reference at the end of each section to credible websites where you could further research specific issues if you cared too.  Fourth, they came up with a self explanatory Risk Meter that is a visual representation of the specific exposure to a certain risk, and severity of consequence if you are exposed to this same risk.

The information is very well organized into three separate parts: 1) what makes men different, 2) what makes men healthy, and 3) men's main diseases, how to prevent them, test for them, and treat them.  The book is quite long at 470 pages.  But, it reads easily.  And, it makes for an excellent medical reference to go back to when you want specific scientific information on various men's health topics.<br />The best part about the book is that it is based on extensive medical studies.  The advice provided is the result of statistically significant conclusions derived from these studies.  Thus, the objectivity, integrity, and intelligence derived from this book is so much greater than from any of the medical authors positioning themselves as the current diet or health care guru.<br />The book confirms the value of EFV.  The ultimately healthy lifestyle consists of a lot of Exercise with a diet that includes lots of Fruits and Vegetables.  These three factors (exercise, fruits, vegetables) appear to be universal protectors against all age related diseases such as cardiovascular diseases and cancer.  Similarly, the high risk factors regardless of the health risk considered seemed to be always the same, including: smoking, obesity, lack of exercise, lots of saturated fats and trans fats in the diet.<br />The book has a ton of information besides the self-evident basics mentioned above.  There are lots of tables, graphs, and summaries that make the information easy to retrieve.  These include info on BMI, PSA test levels, blood pressure and cholesterol levels, recommended frequencies of screening tests, recommended dosage and toxic levels of vitamins and minerals, Glycemic index, life expectancy charts, and lots more interesting stuff.<br />With the medical knowledge derived from this book, you will be in a far better position to take care of your health and initiate a mutually productive dialogue with your general practitioners and specialists.  The World is getting increasingly complex.  Technology and science evolve rapidly.  Nowhere does this increasing complexity have a greater impact than on healthcare.  This book will help you understand your health, risk factors, relevant testing, and cures to be considered.<br />As we age, we will invariably be faced with some challenging options and decisions.  This book is a great road map to help us out along the way.  If you are well informed, it takes a lot of anxiety out of the equation.  That takes care of a major health risk already [stress and anxiety].  This book is good for you!<br />Along the same line of excellent health related information, I also strongly recommend another great book from Harvard Health Publications: &quot;Eat, Drink, and Be Healthy&quot; by Walter C. Willett.  It is the best book on diet and nutrition I have ever read.  And, that is also because it is based on scientific studies, and not on subjective opinions from egocentric blowhards.ral practitioners and specialists.  The World is getting increasingly complex.

Overall, this is a very good collection of tennis drills.  Tina Hoskins covers tennis drills for numerous situations including: singles, doubles, group and children drills, competitive games, and even backboard drills.  That is how she reaches the staggering number of 245 tennis drills.  Given that most players have specific needs and desire associated with tennis drills, you will probably find only a small percentage of these drills useful.  And, that is perfectly OK.<br />In my case, I am a former varsity college tennis player still hitting at the NTRP 4.5 level with a technical orientation to the game.  I actually love challenging singles drills.  Within this book, I actually found only 8 drills (3% of total drills) useful.  But, these 8 drills include some of the most physically and technically challenging drills I ever came across.  The most extreme drill is the one actually portrayed on the cover page.  Frankly, if it was not for this book, I did not think this drill was possible.  This is because it is composed of shots that are typically outright winners (passing shots down the line, and cross court volleys in the open court).  In any case, I tried these 8 drills this past weekend.  And, they worked.  After an hour and half of intermittently doing these drills, and then just hitting around to catch our breath; We did all these drills, had a lot of fun, were more exhausted than usual, but hit the best we ever hit.  I can see how if I keep the work up on these extreme-8s, my game and physical condition will reach the next level.<br />If you are a tennis coach teaching clinics, there are probably many more drills you will find useful within this book.  But even if you are not, you may find the book very useful just like I did.  The drills shown in the book, opens your mind and body to what is possible.  Out of the drills shown, it is easy to tweak them a bit to your own needs.  Thus, tennis drills becomes also a mental game of creativity.<br />The one drawback of the book is that a slight majority of the drills are explained without drawing.  I think the book would have been more effective by concentrating on maybe the best 100 drills and illustrate all of them instead of 245 drills where only a minority of the drills is illustrated.  But, overall this is still a valuable book on tennis drills.ck of the book is that a slight majority of the drills are explained without drawing.

This is an excellent in depth introduction to Discriminant Analysis.  This is the second little green book of the Sage University Paper I have studied.  The first one was on Logistic Regression.  And, the mileage you will get out of these green books will vary based on the complexity of the subject.<br />Frankly, by comparison Logistic Regression was a cruise.  After reading the green book I was able to build an Excel based model longhand replicating most of the methodologies described in the book.<br />Discriminant Analysis is different.  Relative to Logistic Regression it is a real piece of work.  At first, I thought this green book was not as well written as the one on Logistic Regression.  But, that is not the case.  It is just that Discriminant Analysis is that much more complex.  It is a bit like comparing the clarity of a physics textbook vs. a quantum physics one.  The quantum physics one will appear much more obscure.  And, it is not because of the writing style, but because of the subject complexity.<br />With Discriminant Analysis, you just have to accept a longer more intense learning curve than with Logistic Regression.  Given that, this book is excellent.  And, it gives you a pretty good understanding of what it is all about.  It is a bit like learning how to drive.  You can do it without understanding all the mechanical complexities of a combustion engine.  This green book will give you a pretty good understanding on how to \\"drive\\" and interpret Discriminant Analysis.  That probably meets the goals of 90% of the people who approach this Byzantine subject.  If you are among the extreme mathematicians who want to be able to derive all the underlying algorithms, you will need more advanced books.  And, the green book gives you ample references if you care to do that.	2004-06-14

This is a very interesting book that covers many complicated subjects related to group decisions vs. individual decisions.  It touches on Game theory, behavioral economics, and Decision theory.  However, it is not a treaty in any of these areas.  The author keeps his observations at a 10,000 feet high level.  So, the book instead of being a dry tome for mathematicians is actually a very entertaining book for laypersons.<br />The author touches on the many aspects where crowds provide superior judgments than individuals alone.  Our civilization quietly depends on many such favorable situations, These include the capital markets in general, and the stock market in particular.  But, it also includes Nielsen ratings, polls, voting records.  Most of the time, in all these circumstances the many give a better assessment, valuation, or judgment than the individual.  The author is quick to point out that this is not always the case.  Markets experience stock market bubbles where the collective judgment becomes euphoric.  However, year in year out and over decades, the stock market (representing the many) beats the majority of the investment pros hands down.<br />The author is fascinated by the emergence of \\"decision markets,\\" including the Iowa Electronic Markets for betting on Presidential election outcome that has proven more accurate than the polls.  Another such example is the tradesports website that does the same, including betting on sport events, media events, international politics events.  These are perfect examples where the many gather their judgment through trading values thanks to the Internet.  In general, it is uncanny how accurate these decision markets are.  There is really something to the saying \\"put your money where your mouth is.\\"<br />In a nutshell, this is a very interesting and thought provoking book.  It promotes democratic and decentralized decision making within corporations and government institutions.  This makes good sense.  The CEO or the President just can't hold that much information in their individual brains anyway.  Instead, why not rely a lot more extensively on the collective wisdom generated by the aggregated sum of our own individual brilliance.  Why not!the President just can't hold that much information in their individual brains anyway.

This is a very interesting and clearly written book.  From an academic standpoint, it effectively digs some dent in the Efficient Market Hypothesis.  The author addresses ten classic situations, some of them well known, when markets are not efficient.<br />However, the author does not make a convincing case that retail investors can exploit these inefficiencies efficiently.  In other words, the anomalies the author depicts amount to separate trading strategies which should potentially help you achieve the &quot;buy low - sell high&quot; optimum.  However, these trading strategies are associated with much higher transaction costs and taxes than a buy-and-hold strategy of an index fund.  Additionally, some of these strategies are very labor intensive and information intensive.  These are added costs.  Finally, these strategies will cause you to cash out of the market frequently.  The holding of cash balances will further reduce your return compared to investors who remain fully invested.<br />When all is said and done, will you come out ahead exploiting these market anomalies after you factor all added costs?  The author stated that he &quot;generally&quot; does come out ahead of the market.  However, he does not support this vague statement with any documentation.  Also, he adds that going forward his strategies may be less effective because of ever changing market conditions.  Thus, once a market anomaly is exploited by a few investors, the market's ever evolving efficiency erases this anomaly.<br />Although the book is very interesting, it is no substitute to sound investment strategies based on the Efficient Market Hypothesis.  It is a far safer and easier to profit from the market's overall efficiency than to attempt to profit from its few and fleeting marginal inefficiencies.<br />If you are interested in this subject, I strongly recommend the classics by Burton Malkiel: &quot;A Random Walk Down Wall Street&quot; and &quot;The Random Guide to Investing.&quot;  I also strongly recommend John Paulos excellent &quot;A Mathematician Plays the Stock Market.&quot; These books all suggest that you are better off focusing your energy on proper asset class diversification that reflects your risk tolerance.

This is a very clearly written book.  It demonstrates many numerical errors the press, the public, and experts make in interpreting the accuracy of medical screening test (mammography, HIV test, etc...) and figuring out the probability of an accused person being guilty.<br />At the foundation of the above confusions lies the interpretation of Baye's rule.  Taking one example on page 45 regarding breast cancer.  Breast cancer affects 0.8% of women over 40.  Mammography correctly interprets 90% of the positive tests (when women do have breast cancer) and 93% of the negative ones (when they don't have breast cancer).  If you ask a doctor how accurate this test is if you get a positive test, the majority will tell you the test is 90% accurate or more.  That is wrong.  The author recommends using natural frequencies (instead of conditional probabilities) to accurately interpret Baye's rule.  Thus, 8 out of every 1,000 women have breast cancer.  Of these 8 women, 7 will have a positive mammogram (true positives).  Of, the remaining 992 women who don't have breast cancer, 70 will have a positive mammogram (false positives).  So, the accuracy of the test is 7/(7+70) = 10%.  Wow, that is pretty different than the 90% that most doctors believe!<br />What to do?  In the case of mammography, if you take a second test that turns positive, the accuracy would jump to 57% (not that much better than flipping a coin).  It is only when taking a third test that also turns positive that you can be reasonably certain (93% accuracy) that you have breast cancer.  So, what doctors should say is that a positive test really does not mean anything.  And, it is only after the third consecutive positive test that you can be over 90% certain that you have breast cancer.  Yet, most doctors convey this level of accuracy after the very first test!<br />What applies to breast cancer screening also applies to prostate cancer, HIV test, and other medical tests.  In each case, the medical profession acts like the first positive test provides you with certainty that you have the disease or not.  As a rule of thumb, you should get at least a second test and preferably a third one to increase its accuracy.<br />The author comes up with many other counterintuitive concepts.  They are all associated with the fact that events are far more uncertain than the certainty that is conveyed to the public.  For instance, DNA testing does not prove much.  Ten people can share the same DNA pattern.<br />Another counterintuitive concepts is associated with risk reduction.  Let's say you have a cancer that has a prevalence of 0.5% in the population (5 in 1,000).  The press will invariably make promising headline that a given treatment reduces mortality by 20%.  But, what does this really mean?  It means that mortality will be reduced by 1 death (from 5 down to 4).  The author states that the relative risk has decreased by 20%; but, the absolute risk has decreased by only 1 in 1,000.  He feels strongly that both risks should be conveyed to the public.<br />The author shows how health agencies and researchers express benefits of treatments by mentioning reduction in relative risk.  This leads the public to grossly overstate the benefits of such treatment.  The author further indicates how various health authorities use either relative risk or absolute risk to either maximize or minimize the public's interpretation of a health risk.  But, they rarely convey both; which is the only honest way to convey the data.<br />If you are interested in this subject, I strongly recommend: \\"The Psychology of Judgment and Decision Making\\" by Scott Plous.  This is a fascinating book analyzing how we are less Cartesian than we think. A slew of human bias flaws our own judgment.  Many of these deal with other application of Baye's rule.acts like the first positive test provides you with certainty that you have the disease or not.

This is a very interesting, very well written, and researched book.  It investigates why the Right and extreme Right political movement in America has a disproportionate influence on the Nation's politics.<br />The authors make a strong case that this movement's success is in part due to its focus on simple values that are easy to understand and sell.  How can one debate the benefits of free capitalism?  If you don't accept them move to Russia don't you.  How can one debate family values?  That is like attacking Santa Claus.  You just can't do that.<br />However, the unquestioned acceptance of such basic principles get extrapolated into often unreasonable ideological extremes.  The free capitalism bit quickly turns out into a libertarian anti-government and anti-tax movement no matter what the circumstances.  Similarly, the family value ethos sounds fine by itself, but it often turns into a religious anti abortion crusade unique within the Western World.  Thus, the Right becomes pretty quickly the extreme Right whenever it's resulting beliefs are extrapolated to the max, and are compared not only to Democrats but to any other Western country.<br />The authors make the surprising finding that the most reliable indicator of one's party affiliation is not income, but instead church attendance.  You thought that Islam was a religious culture and America a secular one.  It is not so simple.  The Democrats only represent the secular component of our culture; the Republicans are very religious.<br />The authors further state that the Right is very well organized, well funded, and brain-powered.  Indeed, the authors mention several prominent economic think tanks who have direct access to our conservative White House and make a relentless case for continuing tax cuts.  These cuts could eventually cause the demise of Medicare and Social Security that are so unfunded it is scary.<br />The authors suggest that the Liberals have not focused on certain issues as effectively as the Right.  Even though they may dominate the media [Liberals] they have not mounted effective rebuttals to some of the Right's arguments.<br />The author also make a funny case that as more people live in planned communities they become anti-government oriented.  This is because they pay for many local services out of homeowners dues.  Even though they may have a case, my firsthand experience having lived in a condominium association for nearly 20 years is that such shared living arrangements are hotbeds of socialism thinking.  Yes, they maybe anti-government to some degree, but the condominium association has become a de facto substitute for a paternalistic and socialist government Scandinavian style.  In such living arrangement, homeowners do not want to assume the economic risk and responsibility of homeownership anymore.  They expect to transfer all related costs onto the condominium association whether this makes any sense or not.  So, are these planned communities hotbed of conservatism.  It really depends how you look at it.  For my part, I really don't think so.  Besides this one rebuttal, I agree with most other more important themes conveyed within this book.<br />To complement this book, I also recommend Stanley Greenberg's excellent book: \\"The Two Americas, Our Current Political Deadlock and How To Break It.\\"  Also, a few recent articles fit right in with this intellectual investigation of our electorate. One of them is &quot;In Search of the Elusive Swing Voter&quot; by Joshua Green in the January/February issue of The Atlantic Monthly.

Mr. Miller is very creative, innovative, and what have you.  But, he is totally unrealistic.  His book is just an interesting utopia of what we could do with our money if it grew on trees, and if political considerations were irrelevant.<br />The truth of the matter is that we have a structural Budget Deficit of 5% of GDP.  In other words, day in day out our Federal government expenditures exceed our Federal tax receipts by 5% of GDP (about 21% to 16% respectively).  In Miller's utopic language, we would call this the 5% Problem, or the 5 pennies on the Dollar problem.<br />Additionally, if we look at the Federal Government as an insurance company offering retirement annuity policies (Social Security) and health care insurance policies (Medicare, and Medicaid) for which it charges a premium (payroll taxes); the Federal Government is deemed insolvent.  The net present value of the cost of those policies exceeds the premiums received by $72 trillion.  This stresses that we actually have far more than a 5% Problem (in Miller's language) when we consider our tsunami of unfunded liabilities.<br />To resolve our fiscal crisis, we should think like libertarians on the expense side (cut the cost of government programs, restructure Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid) and think like socialists on the revenues side (increase taxation to near European style levels).  Miller does the reverse (think like a socialist on the expense side and like a libertarian on the tax side).  Thus, none of the ideas he comes up with pay for themselves.  Instead, they would dig us deeper in the hole.<br />Also, Miller's creative &quot;grand bargains&quot; amount to various voucher schemes to ultimately insure more people, increase the pay of teachers, and other most laudable social goals.  Unfortunately, most of these \\"grand bargains\\" have already proven to be political nonstarters.  School vouchers have already been turned down many times by voters at the State level.<br />If you want to read good books on the future outlook of the U.S. better grounded in reality, I recommend: Laurence Kotlikoff's &quot;The Coming Generational Storm&quot; that describes the impact of our aging society on our fiscal position.  I also strongly recommend two excellent books by Robert Stowe England: &quot;The Fiscal Challenge of an Aging Industrial World&quot; and &quot;Global Aging and Financial Markets.&quot; These books make extensive comparison between the U.S. and other developed countries' fiscal position.

Carr makes a thought provoking but flawed case that technology does not matter all that much.  According to him, competitive advantages of companies do not depend on technology.  He does point out that many segments of information technology are mature, and have become low return commodities.  He also points out that companies are better off not buying the overpriced state of the art technology, but instead should wait till prices come down.  Thus, Carr makes many relevant and somewhat self-evident points.  Nevertheless, his overall case that technology does not matter falls apart.<br />Contrary to what Carr suggests, the technological race is endless.  There is no finish line.  We are in a 24/7 society hooked on perpetual improvement.  Whatever gismo you come up with, people are going to imitate it and better it very quickly.  Thus, no one can rest on their laurels for long.  By the same token, you can't afford to run a business that is not up to date technologically.  Technology is both the right of entry, and the key to success for almost any business you can think off.<br />Also, innovation is the U.S. raison d'etre.  You figure everything that can be commoditized is going to be either offshored to China or outsourced to India by American companies themselves as pressured by American stockholders.  If the U.S. stops to innovate proprietary technology, our labor force will not remain internationally competitive.  We have to add value to our products.  We have to constantly innovate and create new markets.  If we do, as we have done so far, we will remain the most advanced and productive society.  If we don't, we will fall behind just as many high cost Western European countries already have.<br />If you interested in this subject, here is a couple of books I recommend: \\"Rational Exuberance\\" by Michael Mandel.  He makes a convincing case that technology does matter, and that the U.S. remains the undisputed leader in innovation, and more importantly in implementing innovation.  Another good book is Roger Alcaly's &quot;The New Economy.&quot;  This is an excellent analysis on the history and prospect of technological innovation.  Both these authors get that technology is crucial to the present and future of the U.S.  Carr does not [get it].ementing innovation.

This book covers an amazing amount of information related to the U.S. Government unfunded liabilities in just 8 chapters and 240 pages.  The authors study in detail the demographics, economics, and fiscal policies that have lead to the current fiscal crisis. According to the authors the fiscal crisis has already occurred.  If the U.S. Government's accounting reflected common standards applied to insurance companies, the U.S. Government would be deemed insolvent.  This is because of our huge unfunded liabilities associated with mainly Medicare, but also Social Security.<br />The book covers several parts, including:<br />1) Diagnostic of the fiscal crisis (demographic study),<br />2) Why certain  (pseudo) redeeming factors will not alleviate the problem,<br />3) Why the U.S. will turn in a Banana Republic with hyperinflation,<br />4) Proposals to fix Social Security and Medicare and resolve our fiscal crisis,<br />5) An investment guide to protect one self if the fiscal crisis is ongoing.<br />The authors' persuasiveness of their point of view is erratic from one topic to the next ranging from excellent to really bad.<br />Their treatment of the first two topics: diagnostic and pseudo redeeming factors are outstanding.  The demographics of our aging population represent a tsunami of fiscal costs that have not been provisioned for.  Additionally, wave of immigration, improvement in technology, increase in labor productivity will not alleviate these costs.  Immigrants cost as much in benefits as they pay in taxes.  Technology has actually increased the intensity and the cost of health care.  Also, Social Security benefits are fully indexed to inflation and labor productivity index.  I give this section a 5 rating.<br />The authors are convinced that the U.S. Government will be hell bent on decreasing its real unfunded liability by printing money that will result in hyperinflation. I think this is nonsense.  The Federal Reserve which is politically independent is the body who controls the levers of the money supply and associated inflation.  It will never cause a situation where hyperinflation will take root.  We most probably will have real interest rate levels substantially higher than we do now.  But, the risk is that such high real interest rate levels will choke economic growth and cause recession and deflation, not inflation as the authors suggest.  I give this section a 1 rating.<br />The authors proposals to fix Social Security and Medicare are excellent, as they make economic and political sense.  They are talking of a very slow privatization phase in of Social Security, and a voucher system for Medicare so elderly would make economically informed decision when purchasing health care.  I give this section a 5 rating.<br />Their investment guide unfortunately is piss poor.  I'd give this section a 1 rating, here is why.  The authors recommend holding as your core investments inflation indexed bonds (either TIPS or I Bonds).  However, these bonds give you very mediocre returns before tax.  They give you terrible returns after tax.  Over the long run, there is little chance you will protect your assets against inflation on an after tax basis with these instruments.  They recommend international bonds as a hedge against the inevitable long term depreciation of the dollar [view of the authors].  However, that is unlikely.  Per their own demographic study just about all developed countries have a much worse unfunded liability problem than we have.  This is because their societies are aging more rapidly and their government benefits are more generous.  If the dollar has to tank, you have to wonder against what?  From a long term demographic perspective there are no clear candidates.  Finally, the authors also recommend gold as an investment, especially through gold mining companies.  I think only a gold bug could follow this recommendation.  Gold has little merit as an investment.  It's proclaimed inflation hedging benefits havemelted away twenty years ago.<br />If you are further interested in this subject, I also strongly recommend two excellent books by Robert Stowe England: \\"The Fiscal Challenge of an Aging Industrial World\\" and \\"Global Aging and Financial Markets.\\"  These books give you a better comparison between the U.S. and other developed countries' fiscal position.

This is a fascinating book that gives you a unique insightful look within one of the sharpest mind to populate our government's Defense department intelligentsia.  Barnett is an excellent writer that makes even dry subjects easy to read.  Barnett's foreign policy framework is very clear and understandable.  He splits the World into two.  The first part is the Functioning Core, countries positively engaged in globalization.  The second part is the Non-integrated Gap, countries that are not part of globalization.<br />Globalization as implemented by the Core countries (industrialized countries for the most part) is a positive force that promotes democracy, free trade, economic growth, and peace.  The countries within the Core have no incentive to combat each other.  This explains the d&eacute;tente within the U.S. and Russia relationship.  Similarly, China is no more the enemy, as it is becoming a full-fledged member of the Core.  The Core countries are increasingly connected by abiding to the same trade rules, global financial markets, and international laws that promote economic growth and democracy over time.<br />The countries within the Gap, on the other hand are disconnected.  For Barnett, the more a country is disconnected from the Core, the more dysfunctional and dangerous it is. Quoting the author: &quot;A country's potential to warrant a U.S. military response is inversely related to its globalization connectivity.&quot;  We are talking here of the usual suspects, including countries in Africa, the Middle East, and Central Asia.  These countries are often associated with totalitarian and corrupt regimes, rapid demographic growth, declining living standards, rising unemployment rates.  These countries often experience the demographic bulge mentioned by Samuel Huntington in &quot;The Clash of Civilizations&quot; whereby a growing young, idle male population, combined with high unemployment rate becomes a recruiting pool for terrorist networks.<br />Per Barnett, the Core and Gap countries trade with each other.  But, what they trade is not what you think.  The Gap countries export to the Core: terrorism, drugs, and pandemic diseases (including Aids).  The Core countries export to the Gap: security services (military interventions), globalization, and democracy.<br />Barnett mentions a third category: the Seam countries.  These countries are on the violent borders between the Core and Gap countries.  Their prospect is uncertain.  They can drift towards the Core or back towards the Gap.<br />Paraphrasing some of Barnett's words, he views the U.S. foreign policy as: 1) increasing the Core's immune system capabilities for responding to September 11-like events; 2) working the Seam states to firewall the Core from the Gap's worst exports (terror, drugs, pandemics); and 3) Shrinking the Gap.<br />Forget the Axis of Evil with just three members (Iraq, Iran, and North Korea).  He has developed a long list of troubled spot countries that the U.S. should address while resolving the Iraq situation.<br />To reduce the Gap, the U.S. will have to police the World for a very long time.  He believes that the U.S. is the only country capable of such an effort.  So, it has no choice but assume that role.  In his view, not fulfilling this responsibility will prove disastrous.<br />However, the military component of his theory is highly unrealistic.  With Afghanistan and Iraq on its hand, the U.S. resources are exhausted.  We don't have a fraction of the military power to occupy and rebuild more countries than we are already taking on right now.  We are also exhausted fiscally.  We are running record high Budget Deficits.  And, the Bush Administration is asking Congress every quarter for extra tens if not hundred of billions to resolve the Iraq situation.  More importantly, we seem to be drifting away from the Core into a fourth stand-alone category: the Uniteralist.  The more unilateral our military operations will be, the more costly, unsustainable, and ultimately unsuccessful they will be.<br />Last but not least, Barnett's military zealousness calls for a massive tax increase and implementing a permanent draft.  The U.S. people won't have either of those.  Barnett does not touch on that subject.<br />For a more realistic vision, I recommend Richard Clarke's &quot;Against all Enemies&quot; and Wesley Clark &quot;Winning Modern Wars.&quot;  Both authors advance a better strategy, which is to address terrorism as a supranational issue that you can't fight State by State (forget the Map).  Instead, our intelligence agencies should be more proactive and aggressive in cooperating with their counterparts in Europe, Asia, and everywhere possible to seize and capture terrorists, and treat them accordingly once seized.nsustainable, and ultimately unsuccessful they will be.  <br />Last but not least, Barnett's military zealousness calls for a massive tax increase and implementing a permanent draft.

In September of 2000, Mandel released his first book &quot;The Coming Internet Depression.&quot;  Then, he stated that the Dot.com stocks were going to take a beating.  In fact, the NASDAQ had already imploded in the first quarter of 2000.  Mandel thought this event would have dire economic consequences for decades.  However, we never experienced a &quot;Depression.&quot; Instead we experienced the mildest recession on record.  In other words, Mandel's judgment at the time was way too &quot;Depressed.&quot;  This time around, Mandel's judgment is way too &quot;Exuberant.&quot;<br />Much of what Mandel says is correct.  The U.S. economy remains the World's powerhouse of innovation.  Our society is better at developing and implementing innovations.  This is due to our being accepting of risk, our flexible labor markets, our entrepreneurship climate, and our capital markets for financing innovation being unparalleled.  So far, Mandel is right.<br />He continues his case along the &quot;New Economy&quot; theory, whereby our unprecedented level of innovation will have long lived benefit including superior labor productivity and economic growth for decades to come.  This is correct, and is a truism by now.  This theory is seventy years old, as first stated by Joseph Schumpeter, an Austrian economist who passed away in 1950.  His brilliant concept was &quot;creative destruction.&quot;  This is where new technologies displace jobs, but replaces these by higher value added ones.  Mandel also believes that our economic sustainable economic growth rate is much higher than we have historically thought.  Well, Alan Greenspan has said the same thing for years, and has actually implemented his vision with his lacks monetary policy.  Thus, in terms of technology and economic growth much of what Mandel says is true.  But, there is no new material here.<br />So, where does Mandel go astray?  Mandel's analysis has overlooked the combination of demographic forces (the aging of the Baby boomers) and their staggering related fiscal costs (Social Security and Medicare).  If you think of the Federal Government as an insurance company with predictable claims liabilities; this insurer is insolvent.  The retirement benefit claims (Social Security and Medicare benefits) the elderly have against this insurer way exceed its premium earned (social security taxes) and its reserves (Social Security trust fund).  This gap on a net present value basis, as disclosed in the Social Security and Medicare trustees' reports, amounts to $72 trillion!<br />What are the implications of this $72 trillion?  It means that a huge portion of capital will be necessary to support Social Security and Medicare benefits of U.S. citizen.  This will cause:<br />a) A dwindling of capital available for more productive use such as financing R&amp;D;<br />b)A huge rise in demand for money, which will increase its cost (rates).  Thus, rates will go up.  This will slow the rate of investment, capital formation, labor productivity, and economic growth.<br />c)An increase in the Government debt level to potentially unsustainable level.<br />This is a huge issue Mandel has underestimated.  The concept that technological innovation can bail us out of this fiscal crisis is utopic.  Every serious economist of either side of the aisle knows that.  Mandel, instead chooses to criticize them all for being pessimistic.  By doing so, he looses all credibility.<br />For excellent fiscal analysis, I recommend Laurence Kotlikoff's &quot;The Coming Generational Storm&quot; and Robert Stowe England &quot;Global Aging and Financial Markets&quot; and &quot;The Fiscal Challenge of an Aging Industrial World.&quot;  Also, Robert Rubin &quot;In an Uncertain World&quot; and Paul Krugman's &quot;The Great Unraveling&quot; are also very interesting on economic and fiscal issues.  Joseph Stiglitz &quot;The Roaring Nineties&quot; is a good piece of economics revisionism.  Finally, Roger Alcaly's &quot;The New Economy&quot; is a better analysis on the history and prospect of technological innovation.onomy&quot; is a better analysis on the history and prospect of technological innovation.	2004-05-11

This is a fascinating book analyzing how we are all far less Cartesian than we think.  In other words, a slew of predictable human bias flaws what we feel is our own objective judgment.  The author eminently demonstrates this point by forcing the reader to take a 39 questions test at the beginning of the book.  This test is stuffed with all the traps that illustrate the human judgment flaws that he analyzes thoroughly in following specific chapters.<br />You can view the test as a very entertaining IQ test from hell.  The questions seem often simple.  But, they are not.  Other times, they are obviously difficult.  I got a bit more than half of them correct.  This was mainly because I had some knowledge or experience regarding certain traps the questions presented.  I had made the mistake before.  So, I learned from that.  When I did not have any prior knowledge of a question, my results were very human, meaning not that good.  But, learning the correct answer was both fun and educating.<br />The author touches on several fascinating probability and statistic concepts.  One of them being the Bayes theorem, which suggests that medical screen test can be highly unreliable despite being touted as 80% to 90% accurate.  In other words, you better understand the Bayes theorem better than the medical specialists who screen you for various diseases.  Because, based on the author's study, doctors don't have a clue.  Another chapter had an excellent discussion on correlation vs. causation.  This includes some tricky nuances that many analysts in the financial industry trip upon.  Another interesting probability concept is why it takes only 23 people in a room to have greater than a 50% that two of them share the same birthday.  This seems impossible, but it is true.<br />The book has obviously a lot more than I am letting on here.  I am not going to ruin it for you.  It is really fun, educating, and interesting to read.  You will also learn a whole lot about how you think, how others think, and how people think in groups.  You will also understand how tricky it is to ask truly open and objective questions.  Also, polls that seem objective are not due to the subjective structure of the question.

It better explained the causes of 9/11 than most books written after 9/11!<br />Now, Huntington's focus has turned inward to the changing identity of American society. He considers that the demographic explosion of Mexicans within the U.S. is causing a Clash of Civilizations within our borders.  This is not going to be a destructive clash as the one with Islam.  Nevertheless, Huntington suggests it may alter the identity of the U.S.<br />Huntington states that the U.S. identity is the result of an Anglo-Protestant culture characterized by the English language, the rule of law, work ethic, education, and upward mobility.  This entails that each generation has aspired to achieve a higher standard of living.  Immigrants from all over the World have adopted this Anglo-Saxon creed as their own road to success.  Generations of Europeans, and Asians adopted the English language as a mean to thrive within American society.<br />However, according to Huntington, Mexicans are different.  Mexican immigration differs from past immigration due to a combination of factors, including: proximity, scale, regional concentration, and historical presence.<br />Mexico is a large country contiguous to the U.S. with a huge population of 100 million.  Mexicans infiltrate the porous U.S. border in unprecedented numbers.  Thus, Mexicans dominate the influx of emigrants to the U.S.  They also tend to settle in Border States.  By 2050 Hispanics are projected to represent 25% of the U.S. population.  Today they already account for over 32% of the population in California and Texas.  Many Mexicans view their infiltration within the U.S. as their regaining territorial claims they had lost to the U.S. in the mid 1800s.<br />Huntington states there are serious implications to the Mexicanization of parts of the U.S.  Hispanics, including Mexicans, unlike other immigrants, do not buy into the Anglo-Protestant creed of our founding settlers.  Asians moved to the U.S. and faced formidable linguistic barriers, as their mother tongue was so different from a Western language.  But, they did not think this was a problem.  However, Hispanics thinks it is.  They promote a bilingual country.  Over time, they will demand bilingual education, and bilingual political access and power.<br />Huntington's arguments are challenging because they are well founded.  Huntington mentions that Mexicans do not believe in the Anglo-Protestant creed on several counts.  Contrary to other minorities, Mexicans do not buy into education as a road to success. He has studied the educational profile of Mexicans.  He noticed that Mexicans' education levels across generations are actually declining.  The fourth generation descendents of Mexican immigrants (the great grand children of the first immigrants) are less well educated than the third generation.  Only 9.6% of Mexicans earn a college degree.  This is about half the rate of African Americans, commonly considered the most underprivileged minority group in the U.S.  As a result of their declining academic achievement, the fourth generation also experiences lower income and a dramatically lower level of homeownership (only 40.3% vs. 55.1% for their parents' generation; and 64.1% for the U.S. average).<br />Huntington quotes members of the Latino business community who recognize the difference between the cultures.  These businessmen indicate that several cultural features keep their respective community behind, including: mistrust of people outside the family, lack of initiative, self-reliance, and ambition; little use for education; and acceptance of poverty as a virtue necessary for entrance into heaven.<br />If you want to further study this topic, I recommend David Heer's &quot;Immigration in America's Future&quot;; Richard Alba's &quot;Remaking the American Mainstream&quot;; and Barry Edmonston's &quot;Immigration and Ethnicity.&quot;instream&quot;; and Barry Edmonston's &quot;Immigration and Ethnicity.&quot;	2004-05-05

This book is superficial and is more about enumerating countless dimensions vaguely associated with training than learning itself.  The author mentions six different dimensions related to learning.  Only one of them is meaningful: Learning Style [Visual, Audio, Kinesthetic].  The five others are trivial.  However, by throwing so many dimensions at you that are not so relevant, she dilutes her message immensely.  These six different dimensions actually result in 432 possible styles of learning.  This is just absurd, and renders her whole learning framework unusable.  She gets through this maze by only touching the surface of each dimension, and never addressing a specific learning type across more than one dimension at a time.  For instance, using her language how would a Goal-oriented, Visual, Global, Space-Oriented, Small Group, Think to Talk learning style person best learn.  How would such a specific learner best take notes, prepare for a test, learn a new discipline.  You will never know because this is one of the 432 learning types you can come up with.  She will just share vague recommendations about how a Visual learner learns, or a Goal-oriented learner learns.  So, you get these disconnected and superficial pieces of information.  And, it is up to you to connect the dots.  Good luck.<br />The author gets wrong the one single relevant learning dimension she mentions.  She subdivides Learning Style along three sensory subgroups, when it should be four.  Kinesthetic and Tactile are two different subgroups.  Also, the test she gives in the book is way too short, and vague to give an accurate assessment of your own Learning Style.<br />Occasionally, her writing style is really boring.  In one chapter, she emphasizes the learning power of practicing.  She then lists about 10 insights on the subject.  But, they were all saying exactly the same thing that practice takes time and is important.<br />Fortunately, there is a much better book on this subject: &quot;How to Learn Anything Quickly&quot; by Ricki Linksman.  This book is everything the other book is not.  It is relevant, and effective.  It tests your learning style along two effective axes: Learning Style (Visual, Audio, Kinesthetic, and Tactile), and Brain Dominance (Left-brain, Right-brain).  Thus, the author's framework includes a very manageable eight different specific learning style.  The author devotes an entire chapter on each of these styles.  By reading the one relevant to you [i.e. Visual Left-Brain], you will learn a lot about how to better absorb information, acquire knowledge and expertise in any field, get ready for a test.  The author gets into practical details such as what style of note-taking will work best for you, or what kind of writing or project outline will help you out.  In other words, this book really teaches you how to learn; unlike &quot;Learn More Now.&quot;<br />If you want to study this subject further, I recommend all the excellent books by Howard Gardner, and Tony Buzan.  Gardner is the developer of the Multiple Intelligence Theory.  Buzan is the inventor of the Mind Mapping technique, a really amazing and fun learning tool.

This is an excellent book that analyzes the reasons behind the French-American political rift.  The writing is very lively, as it is structured as a debate between two very insightful journalists: Jean-Mari Colombani, editor of Le Monde, and Walter Wells, editor of the International Herald Tribune.  Both live in Paris.<br />The two co-authors do an excellent job in contrasting the two cultures.  This is not a third class political shouting match.  Both of them are well versed in both cultures, and agree on as many points as they disagree.  But, throughout, they educate you on the extensive differences between these two dominant cultures of the Western World.<br />It is no surprise that our governments clash.  Both of them do not take well to being number two.  In a sense, from an intellectual standpoint, both governments are as unilateral as the other.  It happens one leads the number one power and attempts to lead the World; the other leads a second tier nation and attempts to lead the number one supranational governmental body.  It is in their respective \\"attempts\\" that the French and American governments experience growing frustration.<br /><br />In several ways, the two countries represent polar opposites of a Western style democracy.<br />France is really a technocracy much more than a democracy.  The members of the power structure in both commerce and politics typically have graduated from the top universities with degrees in engineering, political science, law, or business.  Within such an elitist system there is very little chance for entrepreneurship.  The opportunity for self-made success American style are close to zero in France.  In good part, this is because of France's hefty socialist safety net.  It is nice for the unemployed, but it's heavy tax and regulatory structure makes it virtually impossible to start a business.  The power is totally centralized.  It is Paris or else.  This was the way Napoleon Bonaparte structured France as a centralized Republic run by an elite.  Two centuries later not a whole lot has changed.<br />The U.S. is a truer democracy with its own qualities and flaws.  Our society is much more open.  Individuals have a greater chance to succeed regardless of their educational background.  As a result, the American labor markets are far more flexible, and the economy is far more productive than the French one.  Similarly, the American rate of innovation and implementation of such innovations is much superior to France.  On the other hand, intellectuals are often scorned.  Elitism is sometimes dismissed to an excessive degree.  Repercussions of this are many.  Including a steady deterioration of the intellectual content of our entertainment culture that aims at the lowest common denominator within our society.  This is because there are more bucks to be made with the masses, and the higher Nielsen ratings are there to prove it.<br />After reading this book, you will feel a lot more ambivalent about any preconceived ideas you had regarding the French-American tension.  You may even feel that ideally Americans should be a bit more like French in terms of education, culture, insights, and intellect; and French more like Americans in terms of self-reliance, entrepreneurship, dynamism, optimism, and accountability.

US	52977415	R2HTXJTDNOV7ZX	1594200092	686377339	Alexander Hamilton	Books	5	509	545	N	N	The best Alexander Hamilton biography.	This is an excellent biography on Alexander Hamilton, a formidable and sometimes controversial figure among our Founding Fathers.  He is best known for being one of the main contributors to the Federalist Papers and being the first Secretary of the Treasury of the United States.<br />There is a lot to like and be in awe about Alexander Hamilton.  There is also quite a bit to dislike.  Was he a visionary and a genius?  Or a power hungry and greedy autocratic figure reminiscent of the British the U.S. fought away at the time.  Through the past decades his place in history has gone through several reincarnations of both positive and negative revisionism.<br />Ron Chernow is undoubtedly on the sides of the Hamilton fan.  However, even though his portrayal of Hamilton may not be totally objective.  It is nevertheless fascinating due to its breadth, and depth.  Hamilton comes across as a brilliant individual sometimes centuries ahead of his time.  Chernow develops a convincing case that Hamilton was without peers in his developing the necessary financial and economic infrastructure of what was going to become the modern U.S.<br /><br />If Adam Smith was the Scottish genius who invented modern economics, Hamilton was his American counterpart who actually applied modern economics principles in the governing of a new nation.  His understanding in such matters far surpassed his more famous political opponents such as Madison and Jefferson.<br /><br />Chernow mentions several examples of Hamilton's unique foresight.  One was Hamilton's successful defeat of the discrimination bill.  This was a nonsensical concept that proposed that capital gains on sales of treasury securities should flow back to the original investor.  Hamilton quickly saw that such a concept was operationally unworkable and would prevent the development of a liquid market in tradable government securities.  It would affect the U.S. ability to issue new bonds and finance both government operations and other upcoming wars.  He made his case convincingly and the discrimination bill was defeated 36 to 13.  Another bold move by Hamilton was to enforce the assumptions of all States' debt by the Federal Government.  Thus, the fragmented portfolio of U.S. debt formerly backed by the weak credit of each specific State was now fully backed by the U.S.  This reassured foreign investors, and allowed the Treasury to refinance some of the bonds with much longer terms and at lower interest rates.  This prevented the U.S. to become bankrupt under the mountain of debt it had amassed as a result of its wars to fight for its independence.<br />After reading this book, you will feel that we would be only so lucky as to have a Secretary of the Treasury of Alexander Hamilton's caliber and genius.

US	52977415	R28REYGB8GRALK	074325547X	828250107	Plan of Attack	Books	5	18	21	N	N	Iraqgate!	Woodward's reportage triggered the Watergate scandal three decades ago and forced Nixon to resign.  Will this book force Bush to resign?  Probably not, but it will hurt his reelection campaign.  The book describes in detail the Administration most secretive \\"Plan of Attack\\" against Iraq first started in November 2001, while the U.S. was still at war with Afghanistan.  It also reveals how this plan was financed in unauthorized and unconstitutional ways reminding one of the Iran-Contra scandal.<br />Woodward's portrays Dick Cheney as a maniac hell bent on ousting Saddam Hussein since the beginning of the Bush Administration.  He was obsessed after September 11 in linking Saddam Hussein to Al Quaeda whether any reliable evidence could be uncovered or not.<br />Colin Powell felt all along that we should not invade Iraq.  He felt Cheney had an \\"unhealthy fixation\\" with Saddam Hussein, and that it was blurring his judgment across the board.  The differences between them became so grave that all communications between the two broke down.  Unfortunately, it is the moderate Powell who became isolated from internal debates on foreign affairs.  This is an unprecedented situation for a Secretary of State, especially for one as respected and popular as Powell.<br />Woodward suggests the President is a forceful and informed insider.  In November 2001, while the Afghan war against the Taliban was still in full swing, Bush ordered Rumsfeld to develop a plan to invade Iraq.  The communication between Bush and Rumsfeld was totally confidential.  Powell and Rice were kept out of the loop.  Bush shared with Rumsfeld that the need for confidentiality was crucial otherwise any knowledge on our plan of attacking Iraq would cause a furor in the international diplomatic community and among the American public.<br />General Tommy Franks, in charge of the Afghan war was furious when informed he became responsible for coming up with the plan to invade Iraq.  How can he develop such a plan while still fully engaged in another conflict (Afghanistan).  This multi conflict situation led Rumsfeld and Franks to come up with the \\"Rumsfeld\\" doctrine.  It consists in fighting wars with the minimum level of troops using high technology including GPS high precision portable missiles to compensate for the low numbers of soldiers.  It worked beautifully in the Iraq war.  But, it has been a disaster in the follow up peacekeeping effort.  We just never had enough soldiers to control a population of 25 million.<br />Later in the book, Woodward comes up with a bombshell.  In July 2002, the Administration needed $700 million to finance the \\"Plan of Attack.\\"  It was funded in a clandestine fashion approved by the President, but unknown to Congress by shifting funds approved for the Afghan War.  This resembles the Iran-Contra deal during the Reagan-Bush Sr. Administration.  Given that many of the advisors were the same (Cheney and Rumsfeld among others) we should not be surprised.  Obviously, this shifting of funds by the Administration away from their authorized purpose raises serious constitutional and governance issues.<br />CIA director George Tenet does not fare well in this book.  On December 21, 2002, he and his top deputy John McLaughlin made a presentation to the President and VP (Powell and Rice conspicuously absent) assuring them that Saddam Hussein definitely possessed weapons of mass destruction.  The President was not convinced, and stated that the information presented was not adequate to persuade the American public.  But, Tenet answered \\"don't worry, it's a slam dunk case.\\"  This statement gave Bush undue confidence regarding Hussein having developed WMDs.  Per Woodward, Tenet's statement was a grave mistake that possibly changed the course of history.  A more integer CIA director rendering an objective lack of evidence of WMDs could have dissuaded the President to move forward on this ill fated preemptive war.<br />Here are other excellent books I recommend.  They confirm or supplement Woodward's.  Richard Clarke's \\"Against All Enemies\\" and Wesley Clark \\"Winning Modern Wars\\"  both describe how the Bush Administration's obsession with Iraq proved a waste of resources regarding the real objective of fighting Islamic terrorism.  They also describe how our intelligence effort needs improvement.  Also, Ivo H. Daalder's \\"America Unbound\\" and John Newhouse's \\"Imperial America\\" both confirm the personality profiles depicted by Woodward.  They both admire the intellect and integrity of Powell, but are saddened by his isolation.  They are also concerned about Dick Cheney's excessive influence.  Ron Suskingl's \\"The Price of Loyalty\\" relying on lengthy testimonials by former Secretary of the Treasury Paul O'Neill is also fascinating.er excellent books I recommend.

This book describes in detail the exotic lives of American Foreign Service officers.  The amount of research and related firsthand interviews is unprecedented.  These characters are truly interesting.  Kaplan categorizes them in two groups that can be simply referred as the old breed and the new breed.<br />In Part I and II of the book, Kaplan describes the old breed as a true intellectual and academic elite.  They graduated near the top of their class from Ivy League universities.  They were fluent in several languages including Arabic.  Thus, they were able to confer with the locals, read the local press, listen to the local radio.  They often lived for decades in Arab countries.  From this experience, these individuals developed an unparalleled understanding of the Middle East.  But, their recommendations were at odds with the government hierarchy.  These &quot;Arabists&quot; had a deepened bias to maintain diplomatic relations no matter how dire the situation.  Such a vision was self-serving.  For them, the potential of their embassy closing meant a devastating blow to their own careers.  They had no intention to recycle themselves as Washington DC bureaucrats.<br />In Part III, Kaplan describes the spectacular failings of these old breed Arabists blinded by their self-interest (maintain their foreign assignment jobs) and idealism.  The most egregious case is with April Glaspie, one of the more formidable Arabists, yet one who made the gravest error of judgment.  She met with Saddam Hussein in 1991 a week before Iraq invaded Kuwait.  According to confirmed reports, Hussein shared his intent to attack Kuwait to Glaspie, and she responded that she would recommend that the U.S. stays out of this conflict, and maintain relationship with Iraq under any circumstances.  As they say, the rest is history.  And, history has not been kind to Glaspie.<br />Additionally, because of their perceived leniency towards Arab dictators and totalitarian regimes, these &quot;Arabists&quot; were also perceived as anti-Israel and anti-Semitic.  Some &quot;Arabists&quot; did state that the formation of the state of Israel ruined everything, as related tension throughout the entire Middle East disrupted the continuity in many of their careers.<br />As described in Part IV, the new breed of Arabists is different.  They are more likely to have graduated from a state university than an Ivy League.  But, they are much more pragmatic than their predecessors.  This is for three reasons.  First, their language skills now typically include not only Arabic but also Hebrew.  Second, they don't view a temporary post in Washington D.C. as a demotion.  Thus, they are a lot more mobile back and forth between country assignments and Washington assignments.  Third, they are most entrepreneurial from a street sense perspective.  Many of them have graduated from long and successful stint with the Peace Corps where they honed their survival skills so to speak.  The mix of their language skills and career mobility makes them a lot more pragmatic and objective in their judgment of the Middle East and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in particular.  As a result, their judgment is better trusted in Washington D.C. than their predecessors.<br />If the old breed was much like Indiana Jones, advantureous and brilliant individuals with a romantic view of the Arab World; the new breed is more like &quot;The Recruit&quot; much less affected by ideals, and better able to handle policy ambiguity.<br />Throughout the descriptions of these colorful characters, Kaplan imparts a fascinating history of the Middle East that is now more relevant than ever to understand current events.rabists&quot; were also perceived as anti-Israel and anti-Semitic.

This is an excellent book on the subject.  It covers the subject in detail.  I work in a quantitative group of a large financial institution.  My boss asked me recently to make a presentation on logistic regression, a subject I knew nothing about at the time.<br />Thanks to this book, I was able to develop the knowledge and expertise in this esoteric statistical method to make a descent presentation to my group.  I was also able to develop basic logistic regression models in Excel.<br />Personally, unlike many of my colleagues (Russians with formidable backgrounds in math) I don't have an advanced knowledge in math or statistic.  The book reviewed and taught me what I needed to know to grasp logistic regression.  This included an excellent review of logarithms and partial derivatives.<br />If you are interested to learn this subject, and you need the equivalent of a most user friendly \\"Logistic Regression for Dummies\\" this is the book for you.<br />By the way, logistic regression is not so well known today outside of academic and quantitatively oriented circle.  But, after studying it, I feel like it will take over linear regression big time.  It is such a superior method to analyze situations associated with human behavior and human choices.  Whether you are a psychologist, social scientist, or developer of financial products you will sooner or later have to grasp logistic regression because your counterparts and competitors will.  And, in the statistical evaluation of decision-making, linear regression just can't compete with logistic regression.  This book will help you catch the logistic regression wave.	2004-04-15

This is not a political anti Bush manifesto.  It is a well researched historical roadmap of the U.S. failing counterterrorism effort over the past two decades during which the author had a first hand experience as government official.<br />He covers in some depth the administration under Reagan, Bush Sr., Clinton, and Bush Jr.  Each administration had their weaknesses in this respect.  But, in most cases their weaknesses were due as much to flaws within our government intelligence agencies than flaws at the top level of the Administration.<br />Clarke describes in detail the flaws and lackluster performance of our intelligence agencies, including the CIA, FBI, and the NSC.  Each lack backbone, drive, courage, and focus.  As a result they do a piss poor job of preventing terrorism, protecting U.S. civilians and soldiers both domestically and abroad.  They also produce flawed, inaccurate, or meaningless intelligence of no help to the executive rank of the Administration.  Clarke supports his theories with extensive description and analysis of actual events over the past thirty years.<br />Occasionally, top rank officials compound the mistakes of the intelligence agencies.  This is the case for instance with Paul Wolfowitz, Deputy Defense Secretary, who has been in denial that Saddam Hussein and bin Laden were mortal enemies.  The reason for Wolfowitz denial is easily explained when we find out that he had been the strongest proponent of ousting Saddam Hussein in order to dismantle Al Quaeda years before the actual invasion of Iraq.<br />This is an excellent well-written book that the current Administration has failed to discredit.  It has also a lot of common points with another related excellent book: \\"Winning Modern Wars\\" by Wesley Clark.  Both authors advance that our government strategy of dealing with terrorism as a fight between States is deeply flawed.  Instead, our intelligence agencies should be more proactive and aggressive in cooperating with their counterparts in Europe, Asia, and everywhere where possible to seize and capture terrorists, treat them accordingly once seized, and dismantle the Al Quaeda network piece by piece.  Both Clark(es) recommend a war against terrorism that is radically different than the current neoconservatives strategy of taking over the Islamic World state by state.nterparts in Europe, Asia, and everywhere where possible to seize and capture terrorists, treat them accordingly once seized, and dismantle the Al Quaeda network piece by piece.

US	52977415	RIS27KIZ1M28C	0195170253	778071638	In Defense of Globalization	Books	5	79	95	N	N	This is a readable masterpiece in international economics	This is an excellent book that takes a subject [Globalization] that has become increasingly emotionally loaded and politically intense.  As the U.S. experiences a rising Current Account Deficit, there is a strong perception that Globalization is like a scorpion who has turned its own deadly sting on itself.  Everyday, one sees articles in the press mentioning how the U.S. is loosing its manufacturing jobs to China and its programming jobs to India.<br />Bhagwati, as any classical economists, views Globalization as the manifestation of the competitive advantage of international trade.  In other words, whatever we can obtain from overseas at a lower cost than we can obtain locally will boost the demand for our own products (due to lower costs).  With higher demand comes higher economic growth, higher productivity, and rising living standards.  On the other hand, ill fated protectionist policies, contrary to their humanistic intent, completely annihilate this economic virtuous cycle.<br />However, Bhagwati is not your usual unrestrained free trader.  He feels that governments have to better address the dislocation in labor that is directly affected by international competition.  He states the U.S. should spend more resources on research and on education.  This is so our labor force remains most productive in being engaged in cutting edge industries that have not yet become commoditized.<br />Bhagwati, an Indian, focuses much energy on the benefit of Globalization for all emerging markets.  Contrary to all the anti Globalists demonstrators in Seattle, Cancun, and elsewhere, Bhagwati makes a forceful and well documented case that Globalization is a very positive force that lifts countries out of poverty.  It causes a virtuous economic cycle associated with faster economic growth.  He dismantles the concerns and myths perpetrated by anti-Globalists chapter by chapter.  Thus,  chapters are titled: \\"Culture: Imperiled or Enriched?,\\" \\"Corporations: Predatory or Beneficial?,\\" and \\"Environment in Peril?\\"  In each cases, Bhagwati armed with irrefutable historical data comes on strongly on the side of Globalization and breaks one anti  Globalist myth after another.<br />Bhagwati states that in many cases, Globalization is blamed for whatever goes wrong within a country.  But, that this is a politic of deflection used by corrupt and ineffective political leaders.  Instead of implementing more effective domestic policies and international policies, many government leaders prefer to blame all ills on Globalization, which indirectly means on the U.S.<br />Bhagwati makes an eloquent case that any economic ills in emerging markets is not all the U.S. fault just as U.S. job losses are not all China and India's faults.<br />During this Presidential election year with the loss of U.S. jobs as one of the main Democratic themes, this is a very important book to read.  It would be crucial for Kerry to read it too, otherwise he may fight a loosing campaign pinned on protectionist policies.  By now, even though Globalization and international economics are complex matters, too many voters intuitively understand these subjects to vote in a President on a campaign of protectionism and international economic isolation.

US	52977415	R2HQBKS9AB0XK6	0804745099	163249976	Predicting Presidential Elections and Other Things (Stanford Business Books)	Books	5	20	20	N	N	It should be a bestseller in any Presidential election year.	This is a short book (155 pages, 10 chapters).  And, the dominant theme is how to predict Presidential election (occupies 4 chapters).  Ray Fair writes more like a bestseller writer than an economics professor at an Ivy League that he is (Yale).  His writing style is alive and journalistic.  As a result, his book is a lot more fun to read than your usual dry economics textbook.  You don't need to be a quantitative type to enjoy this book.<br />I came across this book by doing an Internet search on Presidential election forecasting models.  By far the best was Ray Fair's model, as it accurately predicted the outcome in 18 of the past 21 elections.  Really intrigued, I read his technical notes extracted from his working papers published within econometric journals.  But, I could not fully understand some of the key details underlying the foundation of his model.  Fair indicated he had written a book explaining his model for the layperson.  I jumped at the occasion, and bought the book.<br />The book met and exceeded my expectation.  Within the second chapter, the author gives an excellent lesson in linear regression and multivariate regression analysis.  The entire chapter is written in plain and understandable English without recourse to a single Greek letter.  Armed with this renewed and deepened understanding of linear regression, I could easily follow the most relevant details underlying the foundation of his Presidential election forecasting model.<br />This model is really pretty amazing as it forecasted several quarters before the polls did, and before we even knew who the Republican nominee would be that the Gore - Bush election was going to be just about too close to call.  The model uses several macroeconomic factors (inflation, overall GDP per capita growth, number of quarters with very rapid GDP per capita growth) and several political factors (who is the party in power, how long has it been in power, what party is in power) to come up with the incumbent party's voting share of the two party total votes.<br />Right now in March of 2004, this model indicates that Bush will get about 55% of the two party total votes.  This is pretty interesting, given that currently the polls often have Kerry ahead by several percentage points.  Additionally, the model suggests that its estimates of Bush's vote share is unlikely to change radically between now and November.  In other words, it does not foresee a Kerry win under most likely economic scenarios between now and then.  I know this may not be what readers would like to hear, but that is a social science observation, it is not a political opinion.  Mr. Fair's objective is to develop the most accurate model he can.  Granted, the model can always be wrong one more time.  But, given its track record I would not bet big money against it.<br />The book is not just about Presidential elections; it also addresses the following issues:<br />1)Who is more likely to engage in extramarital affairs;<br />2)How to forecast the quality of a new wine;<br />3)How to forecast grades in a college level economics class;<br />4)How to predict by how much people slow down with age<br />5)How to forecast short term interest rates; and<br />6)How to forecast inflation.<br />Issues 5 and 6 are classic macroeconomic concerns.  The author addresses them in a predictable way (using other relevant macroeconomic variables to predict the dependent variable).<br />But within these six issues, two stood out for me.  These include wine quality and how much we slow down with age.  In both cases, the model's output was amazingly interesting.<br />Regarding, wine quality, it suggests you can forecast the quality of a young wine years down the road just by looking at several climate variables around the time the wine was produced.  The back testing of the model was really successful.  In other words, just by observing data and using his multivariate regression model, you can come up with an assessment of a winequality that would probably be more accurate than the subjective opinion of most wine experts.<br />Considering aging, the author looked at age based world records in middle to long distance running disciplines.  From the data, he derived what is the pace of slowing down from one year to the next after age 35.  From looking at his data, you will be amazed of how little the body slows down between 35 and 59 years old.  Sixty appears to be a transition, when the slowing down becomes a bit more rapid.  But, still people who keep healthy and fit can remain pretty competitive well in their early seventies.  This section gives you a totally different perspective about aging; and, frankly a much more optimistic perspective at that.ith an assessment of a wine quality that would probably be more accurate than the subjective opinion of most wine experts.<br />Considering aging, the author looked at age based world records in middle to long distance running disciplines.

This is an excellent source of information on the subject.  I view it as a professional second opinion to the better-known 'The Best 351 Colleges' from the Princeton Review.  Actually, both guides have a near identical structure and methodology.  They both rely on extensive surveys of students who went to these schools.  So, you get excellent qualitative feedback on what the schools are like.  You also get a lot of quantitative information, including range of SAT scores, acceptance rate, student yield, etc...  Both guides have numerous lists including best academics, and a lot of other similar lists ranking schools along a single factor.  Also, they essentially cover the same pool of colleges.<br />While 'The Best 351 Colleges' does a better job at rating all schools among several factors such as: Campus Life, Academics, Selectivity, Financial Aid; 'The Unofficial Guide' provides much valuable qualitative information.<br />For my part, I really feel that you have to acquire both guides.  If you would give these guides an overall personality, The Best 351 Colleges is more of a quantitative left brain type of information source.  While the Unofficial Guide is sometimes more creative.  The two co-authors, Trent Anderson and Seppy Basili, give their own 'biased' opinions within small text box on every single college they review.  Somehow, their short humorous sound bites are very helpful.  They give you the essence of what the school is like.  Sometimes, just by reading their short quotes, you can readily tell whether a school is for you or not.<br />The way to use these guides together is to read the reviews in both guides about the schools you are interested in.  If the two reviews give you the same impression about a school, you can easily assess if a school is right for you.<br />When it gets interesting, is when the two reviews differ.  I ran into such a case, with Lewis &amp; Clark, a liberal arts college in Portland.  Within The Best 351 Colleges, I got that Lewis &amp; Clark had a very liberal college culture that pervaded both the student body and the teaching staff.  But, in The Unofficial Guide, Lewis &amp; Clark was described as fairly apolitical.  In such a case, that is when you have to do more research on the Internet.  If you go to Studentsreview or Epinion, you will see comments from students who went to particular colleges.  In the case of Lewis &amp; Clark, I got that The Unofficial Guide's review was closer to the truth.  Liberal political activists who went to Lewis &amp; Clark were disappointed about the lack of political activism on campus.<br /><br />Additionally, the co-authors of The Unofficial Guide have to be commended on their very healthy approach to college selection.  They promote that the college fit is much more important than the college name.  I could not agree more.  Thus, one will be far more successful if they are very happy at Kenyon College, because of a great match between their own temperament and the college culture, than being miserable at Harvard, because the fit was not so good.ot that Lewis &amp; Clark had a very liberal college culture that pervaded both the student body and the teaching staff.

Unfortunately, it pretends to be a contemporary analysis of The Coca Cola Company's management practices.  And, in this regard it just fails.<br />The book spends a long time on the origin of this all American company.  It also develops well the very successful 16 year tenure of Roberto Goizeta from 1981 until his surprising death in 1997.  It does a good job of covering the miserable and short tenure of Douglas Ivester from 1997 to 1999.  He made so many mistakes within such a short time, that he was forced out before he could do any more damage.<br />Unfortunately, Hays hardly covers the valiant efforts of Daft, CEO from 1999 until February 2004 to turnaround the company.  Thus, her criticism of Coke's management leadership is already two CEOs and nearly four years behind as the book just hits the stores.  For this explicit reason, I would pass it up.<br />Instead, I recommend a similar but far superior book written by another top notch NY Times journalist: The End of Detroit: How the Big Three lost their grip on the American Car Market written by Micheline Maynard.

But, it fleshes out the implication of your choices much better than most guides.  Let's face it, the college experience can't be translated into just numbers, student ratings, and occasional student sound bites alone.  Looking at the numbers alone, one could easily select the best college on paper, and end up being miserable because the qualitative fit of was completely wrong.  This guide will help you big time reducing the chance of you making such a &quot;qualitative fit&quot; error.<br /><br />I have studied over ten college guides.  This one is rather unique.  It is focused strictly on the women's experience from a qualitative standpoint.  It conveys its information through narrative essays written firsthand by the women attending specific colleges.  These essays are typically focused on a single issue relevant to students and even more so to women.<br />These essays are presented in pairs describing in detail various dimensions of the college selection process.  For instance, there are two essays covering the small liberal arts college vs. large state university decision.  This is a pretty crucial decision to make.  To help you out make that decision, one woman writes an excellent essay of what it is like attending Whitman (excellent liberal arts college in the Northwest).  Another woman writes an equally excellent essay about the very large state university, U of Kentucky.  At no point, do these young authors make any comparison between the two.  They just describe thoroughly their first hand experiences, and all analyze in a balanced way the pros and cons of their respective college selection decision.<br />The editor, Cristina Page, chooses well a series of decision axis; including not only small liberal arts college vs. large state university, but also:<br />Urban vs. Rural;<br />Far from vs. Close to home;<br />Coed dorms vs. single gender dorms;<br />Liberal vs. Conservative; and<br />Greeks vs. Independents.<br />In each case, a pair of essays dedicated to each opposite point fully describes what is the implication of selecting such a college on your college experience.<br />Cristina Page makes this wise recommendation that you certainly do not need to read the whole book.  But, you can read selectively among the choices you have in mind.  Thus, if you are interested in attending a large state university, live in a coed dorm, and be on a campus that has a liberal leaning, you can choose the essays that describe each of your choice aspects in details.  Read this way, this guide is really a pretty great college selection guide.<br />A valuable small section of the book focuses on some of the key questions to ask.  These include very interesting questions regarding the politics, vision, experience, and capability of the current President of the school.  It includes similar questions regarding the Faculty.  The editor also mentions key questions about safety issues, crime record, and health facilities.  These questions are often original, and not so often mentioned in other college guides.  Nevertheless, they are very important, and will help you out in  making a better college selection decision.rvative; and<BR>Greeks vs. Independents.<br />In each case, a pair of essays dedicated to each opposite point fully describes what is the implication of selecting such a college on your college experience. <br />Cristina Page makes this wise recommendation that you certainly do not need to read the whole book.

These two professors from the University of Michigan Business School have written a great business strategy book.  In our World, every products and services appear to become commoditized at the speed of light shortly after their innovation.<br />These two authors show how a business can differentiate itself and offer a substantial value added.  By delivering superior goods and services, these will not be subject to commodity pricing anymore, and will reward their respective companies with premium pricing, higher ROE, and higher shareholder value.<br />The value added comes from involving the customer in co-designing the product he wants, and servicing the product with the customer's ongoing online feedback.  The author gives several examples of companies that are using these practices of the future today.  Sumerset Houseboats, a houseboat construction company, actively engages its customers in the boat designing process.  Deere, the farming equipment manufacturer, has developed a GPS system that monitors and diagnoses farming equipment usage and equipment problems by its farming customers.<br />There is no question that such intense customer centric practices represent substantial competitive edges.  The companies that can innovate and deliver such services at a profit will become the winners of tomorrow.<br />Imagine if nowadays you could truly benefit of such troubleshooting services on your home PC.  Offsite, the computer manufacturer would monitor that the latest virus, bugs, spyware have not infected your system.  If it did, it would clean up your system automatically and restore it to health.  Would not you think that such a PC would be worth a 100% mark up over the current commoditized PC that typically falls apart within months after being attacked endlessly by bugs.<br />The type of co-created added value the two authors talk about is the best step forward in protecting the U.S. technological lead going forward.  The companies that do that well will survive and thrive.  The ones who do not will see their products being taken away by lower cost competitors delivering the same commoditized products utilizing Chinese manufacturing and Indian programming.  Given that the two professors are of Indian origins, no one can argue they did not give us a fair warning.<br />This book is well written and very innovative.  If you are an entrepreneur, business strategist, business consultant, MBA student or professor, this is a must read.  If you are none of those, it is still a very interesting and important book showing a good roadmap on how the U.S. can maintain its technological leadership.ill survive and thrive.

There are now tons of books criticizing Bush foreign policy.  The majority of them take a European liberal policy perspective.  They criticize Bush for his unilateral actions, his hegemonic vision, and his preference for hard power (military) over soft power (diplomacy).  Soros does the exact same thing.  He repeats what has been better stated by others years ago.  There is not a single new idea in this entire book, except for his comparison of the U.S. American supremacy to a stock market bubble.  This metaphor is meaningless.<br />The U.S. supremacy is no bubble.  Whether Mr. Soros likes it or not, the U.S. will likely remain the number one power in the World for decades to come.  This is based on the U.S. competitive advantages on so many dimensions, including: demographics (our society is not aging as fast as Europe, Japan, and China), economics (entrepreneurship is more developed here), politics (democracy works after all), technology, and so on and so forth.<br />In many respect, Soros' book reminds me of \\"Fear's Empire\\" by Benjamin Barber. They both overreach in criticizing every minute aspect of our foreign policy.  But, they are both rather weak in conveying practical alternatives.  They are both somewhat blinded by their liberal perspectives. In a sense, they counteract the equally ineffective \\"An End to Evil\\" by David Frum, who is blinded by his own archconservative perspective.  For my part, I recommend books written from a far more effective centrist perspective. These include Wesley Clark's excellent \\"Winning Modern Wars\\" and Robert Cooper's \\"The Breaking of Nations.\\"	2004-02-16

This is the book &quot;du jour&quot; about how to win Presidential election, and how our nation is now almost perfectly split between Republicans and Democrats.  Each party accounts for about 46% of the voters.  So, to win the White House you need to attract independents and swing voters.<br />Our most recent two-term Presidents understood the importance of appealing to such voters.  Reagan appealed to the &quot;Reagan Democrats&quot; in the eighties.  While in the nineties, Clinton the ultimate new Democrat centrist, balanced the Budget, generated economic and job growth, and thus preempted Republican economic platforms.<br />Nowadays, appealing to the 8% independents is very difficult because their value system does not fit within the two party system.  Their values range from the classic socially liberal/fiscally conservative to the iconoclastic socially conservative/fiscally liberal, and anything in between.<br />Greenberg's framework is really helpful in getting a Presidential candidate to earn a majority of the independents and swing voters.  His information is extremely detailed, and emanates from cluster analysis.  This is a statistical method that is increasingly popular in Presidential campaign strategy.  You aggregate the general population in numerous clusters or groups sharing similar behaviors, voting patterns, value systems, education, income, and what have you.  Greenberg illustrates several different examples of such clusters within cities such as Tampa or Seattle, or state as Iowa.  Each cluster is given a different colorful name such as Tampa Blue, Seattle Eastside Tech, and Heartland Iowa.  Each cluster can have subclusters reflecting more specific demographics such as the Super-Educated Women (Democrat loyalist) or Privileged Men (Republicans).<br />The old motto &quot;information is power&quot; is truer than ever.  This upcoming Presidential election is the battle of the demographic statistical databases.  And, according to Greenberg and other sources, the two parties are again about even.  The Democrats have acquired a database of 158 million voters dubbed &quot;DataMart.&quot;  While the Republicans have a database of 165 million people named &quot;Voter Vault.&quot;  These databases have over 300 \\"lifestyle variables\\" allowing the database managers to forecast voting patterns, and effectiveness of political campaigns.<br />Armed with Greenberg's type of information, a Presidential candidate can now customize his message(s) to these various clusters of swing voters.  Thus, the art of political eloquence nowadays is to target your speech addressing specific issues to your local or regional audience without contradicting yourself from one town to the next.  The Presidential candidate who best understands the data, customizes his speeches with effective issues, and implement the best strategy will win more swing voters and win the overall election.<br />Within the Democratic Primaries, Kerry and Edwards understand well this sophisticated game. Dean and Clark who had surging early successes in polls and fundraising did not understand this game so well.  Dean being a single note Bush-bashing mouthpiece, and Clark doing the same thing focused exclusively on foreign policy and Iraq in particular.  Thus, Kerry and Edwards's superior understanding of Greenberg's type of information made them superior candidates despite both lagging in fundraising and polls early on.<br />Just to clarify any confusion, Greenberg and Edwards &quot;Two Americas&quot; frameworks are very different.  For Greenberg it represents polarized politics with nearly half the country being Republican and the other being Democrat.  For Edwards, the &quot;Two Americas&quot; is a class hierarchy with one America consisting of the super-rich who have readily access to the best services from the private sector, and often benefit from questionable government subsidies and tax loopholes.  The other America consists of the rest of us who struggle with the rising costs of health care, higher education, and insurance.<br />In summary, Greenberg's two Americas are divided along a political axis, and the two Americas are roughly equal (46% of the population each).  Edwards' two Americas are divided along an income axis; and, one represents only 1% of the population (the Super Rich).  While the other represents 99% of the population.<br />Greenberg's book is excellent, very well written, and incredibly informative.  It is rather unique and ultimately current.  I am hard pressed to recommend any like-books. Instead, I come up with a few recent articles that complement very nicely what Greenberg is talking about.  One of them is &quot;In Search of the Elusive Swing Voter&quot; by Joshua Green in the January/February issue of The Atlantic Monthly.  The other one is &quot;Eatanswill revisited&quot; a special report in The Economist of January 31st, 2004.

It is a descent work of business history.  It covers well-known themes, including a business culture increasingly obsessed with short-term gains, a corrupt security analysis industry that boosted share prices to unrealistic levels.  It also depicts the evil partnership between CEOs and their accounting firms that cooked the books of their respective companies to deliver phony earnings.<br />Our financial system was fraught with so many conflicts of interest that the crash was an inevitable accident waiting to happen.  The security analysts sold their souls and earned their bonus from the related investment banking fees they helped generate.  The accountants did the same thing by marketing associated consulting services to the same clients they delivered auditing services to.<br />Lowenstein covers in depth all the related villains, including Marcia Meeker, the leading security analyst who bears much responsibility for boosting Internet stocks to unreal levels. Jack Grubman did the same for the telecommunication industry.  If these two characters had been taken out of the security analysis game earlier, maybe the Bubble would have been less inflated.  Indeed, if you take out Internet and telecommunication stocks, the bubble just about evaporated.  The remainder of the stock market sectors was not nearly as inflated, and therefore did not decline nearly as much when the Bubble burst.<br />So, why is this book not this great?  If you have read the financial press during the past decade, you won't get much new insights here.  The causes of the Bubble are well known, and have been analyzed thoroughly by other journalists for years.  Additionally, Lowenstein underplays the fact that the Bubble really affected, as mentioned above, a very narrow sector of the stock market.<br /><br />This book is weaker than Lowenstein's previous one: &quot;When Genius Failed.&quot;  Back then, Lowenstein tackled one of the most complex shock to the capital markets.  He analyzed and described in understandable terms how a hedge fund went belly up using pretty sophisticated convergence strategy.  He also reported how Greenspan saved the day by coercing large banks to bail out Long Tern Capital Management.  This was all fascinating and educating stuff.  You won't find that much high intensity gray matter in &quot;The Great Bubble.&quot;<br />A far better book on the Bubble is Robert Shiller's &quot;Irrational Exuberance.&quot;  Shiller's book is more technical, well researched, and academic (in a positive sense).  And, more importantly, Shiller's book was prescient.  He wrote it in 1999, it was published in early 2000 just before the Bubble actually burst.  It is more impressive to foresee the future as Shiller did vs. narrating the past as Lowenstein is doing.capital markets.

US	52977415	R2Q43IRMBQIAH6	0670032646	621157776	American Dynasty: Aristocracy, Fortune, and the Politics of Deceit in the House of Bush	Books	2	28	49	N	N	Dynasty Conspiracy Theory	This is a very well researched book, as mentioned by many enthusiastic reviewers.  The book is very well written and has been already very successful with the Bush bashing readers.  If you are among them, I'd have to recommend the book as I am sure you will enjoy it tremendously.  However, I'll share with you why I am less enthusiastic about this book than others.  It is certainly not because I am a Bush lover.  I am actually an Independent, and am very seriously considering voting for Kerry in November.<br />Phillips is obsessed by the fact that the Bushes produced the first father-and-son Presidency since the Adams did nearly two hundred years ago.  Let's face it, if Dubya had not been elected in 2000, Phillips would have had to find another subject for his book.  But, somehow he did.  This allowed Phillips to develop his Dynasty Theory.<br />Phillips investigative drive would have you believe that the Bushes were elected into the top political spot in good part due to the influence associated with their powerful connections from their membership in the Skull and Bones secret Yale society.  Also, energy and defense industry special interests were to have a major influence in the Bushes political success.  And, they certainly must have to some degree.  Just tracking the money trail alone, one can observe these special interest groups and others represented a significant percentage of the campaign donations the Bushes raised.  So, Phillips certainly scores many reasonably strong points on his history of influence.<br />However, the dominant factors of the Bushes successes (and failures) in Presidential elections were external factors beyond their control.  In 1988, Bush Sr. rode the coat tail of Ronald Reagan, one of the most popular president in modern times.  And, probably even more importantly, Bush Sr.  benefited from a strong economy associated with one of the longest economic expansion and Bull market in the post WWII era.  Those are the forces that truly placed Bush Sr. in the White House in 1988.  These same type of forces are the ones who took him out in 1992.  Indeed, in 1992 the Reagan coat tail factor was gone, and the economy went bust.  And, Bush was cleanly ousted from the White House.  The success of Bush Jr. in 2000 is also rather easily explainable. The roaring nineties were already coming apart.  So, Gore could say the Clinton - Gore economic record was excellent looking back.  But, going forward the economic record was looking a bit foggy and uncertain already.  That sets a stage when the electorate is ripe for change.  This is especially true after an 8 year reign of the same party at the White House.  Additionally, Gore had to be one of the weakest campaigners, speakers, and overall democratic candidates in modern times.  Add to that a \\"Perfect Storm' set of highly unlikely statistical events associated with a virtual tie between Bush and Gore that was broken only by the Supreme Court; and there you have it.  Bush Jr. got in the White House.<br />Whether Bush Jr. will get reelected this year in 2004 is hard to tell.  But, if we look at some external forces,  the wind is behind him right now.  The economy is strong.  So, if he gets reelected Phillips and company will say \\"I told you so\\";  But, the answer is \\"it's the economy stupid\\" and not much else.  So, where Phillips sees influence of quasi American monarchies at play and a broken democracy; others will see a much more realistic scenario of external forces at play, mainly economics and security, and a democratic system that works just fine thank you very much.  If Bush Jr. looses, well it is the end of the Dynasty Theory anyway.<br />For my part, I would recommend a far better book on a related subject: `The Price of Loyalty' by Ron Suskind with the assistance of Paul O'Neill, former Secretary of the Treasury.  If you have serious reservations about the current Bush presidency, this book will confirm them.  `The Price of Loyalty' is much better grounded, and has more powerful insights than `American Dynasty.'  True insider account wins out handily over the Dynasty Conspiracy Theory.etter grounded, and has more powerful insights than `American Dynasty.'

This is the third college guide written by the Greenes I have read.  So far, they have all been excellent.  This book is an in depth analytical study extracted from a survey of over 3,000 students who attended twenty elite schools (8 Ivies, 9 private universities, and 3 top public universities).  As usual, the Greenes writing is impecable and very lively, including numerous direct fascinating quotes from students.  This makes digesting this occasionally dry material a lot more fun than expected.<br />This book is a reality check.  Apparently, the character of these schools has really changed over the past several decades.  Gone is the collegiate country club atmosphere some of these campuses may have had.  Instead, the atmosphere is now described as intense, competitive, and cutthroat by 90% of the students in the survey.  Also, 84% of the students indicated that the academic workload was their overriding concern.  The grade pressure is intense and made doubly so given the exceptional student body.  How can you possibly excel among straight As valedictorians with many of the classes graded on a curve?<br />The Greenes mention that going to such academically competitive schools may be a questionable choice to maximize your chance to go to top graduate schools.  Regarding two Med school candidates with equivalent academic caliber, one has a 2.9 GPA from Yale the other a  3.6 GPA from State U. Who wins?  The higher GPA candidate will win out.  Additionally, the Greenes remove the illusion that if you go to Harvard undergrad you have a better shot at a Harvard graduate school.  You don't.  The top graduate schools recruiting throws a nationwide net looking for the best talent (the higher GPAs among other parameters).<br />The Greenes' survey removes any illusion that these top colleges represent ideal communities.  They do not.  Their academic pressure-cooking atmosphere results in numerous psychological and social ailments.  The amount of drug usage, alcohol consumption, including frequent binge drinking is rampant.  Binge drinking is practiced on a regular basis by 80% of the fraternity and sorority houses.  For non-Greek members binge drinking practitioners still represent 45% of men and 36% of women.  These behaviors result in occurrence of depression, date rape, sexual abuse, and other safety issues.  In this regard, women are more vulnerable for obvious reasons.  Within the survey, 50% of women indicated they were concerned about their safety on a daily basis.<br />Another result of the academic pressure and grade competition is the surprisingly high level of cheating.  Within the survey, 29% of the students indicated that academic cheating had a direct effect on their class position or grades.<br />The survey feedback regarding academics was mixed.  For instance, Harvard's faculty was criticized for being removed and not good teachers.  Is this really the best college in the nation?  On the other hand Princeton, Yale, Columbia received high praise for their faculty.  Feedback regarding college social life was often more mediocre.  As you can imagine extremely high IQ has no positive correlation with EQ.  In other words, don't necessarily expect a healthy, balanced, and fun social life from these schools.<br />But the myth lives on.  By many other standards, these schools remain the most successful ones in the nation.  They achieve staggeringly high graduation rates ranging from 90% to 97% compared to only 40% for the nationwide average and about 70% for any pretty descent school.  Also, 83% of the students indicated they would make the same school choice again if they relived their recent past.  This is most probably far higher a percentage than for lesser schools.  And, this is despite the high stress, the concern about academic workload, and often the criticism in the quality of the teaching delivered by the faculty.  Is this masochism?<br />The Greenes indicate what it takes to remain sane in such a stressful environment.  This entails being self-motivated, with a strong psyche, a creative spirit, a tolerance for ambiguity and uncertainty, and a sense of humor to let you take on adversity in stride.<br />The Greenes recommend an excellent method in selecting a college.  First know thyself.  Be aware of what academic, and geographical environment you will thrive in.  What is your preferred classroom learning environment?  How intellectually driven are you really?  What are your relevant fears and weaknesses regarding your adaptative skills to the campus life?  Only by asking yourself these tough questions, will you know what kind of school represents a good match.  Next, look at your achievements (GPA/SATs) and within the pool of schools that represent a good match, you look at the best fit by investigating the schools in details.  The Greenes have a three page list of investigative questions to ask administrators of prospective schools including issues on campus safety, campus social atmosphere, quality of campus living, alcohol and drug policy, availability of substance free dorms, crime record.  This college selection is a sane alternative to the brand name obsession we have with the top schools.tressful environment.

And, that is a very good thing.  The American reading public has an insatiable appetite for foreign policy books.  Authors have only been too pleased to meet this booming demand.  Every other month if not every other week a new must-read foreign policy book comes on the market.  The quality of such books is erratic at best.  Most authors' analytical judgments get biased by their political stripes.  As a result, the resulting political analysis suffers.  Unfortunately, this book is no exception.<br />Johnson gathers a lot of very interesting historical information.  But, he makes a mundane and weak argument regarding the now well-known 'Imperial Overstretch.'  In other words, every empire eventually falls apart because of the fiscal burden associated with controlling an ever expanding and eventually unmanageable territory.  Paul Kennedy in 'The Rise and Fall of Great Powers' made such a case so much better and forcefully back in 1989.  Johnson's book by comparison seems shortsighted.  The problem with this theory (Imperial Overstretch) is that its time may not have come yet.  Yes, defense spending is now growing.  But, its fiscal burden at around 5% of GDP is much less than during the Reagan Years in the mid eighties.  Also, Johnson mentions a private defense sector that is bulging.  But, the employment count within this sector is no higher than it was several decades ago.<br />Regarding foreign policy, this book reads often like an X File, or a blog from a conspiracy theory aficionado.  Yes, it is true that with 20/20 hindsight the U.S. government made what seems like diplomatic errors.  What is also true is that foreign policy is an incredibly complex and liquid domain.  Alliances and momentum shifts all the time.  The same political leader of a foreign country may be the only factor keeping a country together at one point, and be rightfully perceived as an infamous dictator a decade later.  That Johnson does not get.  His entire book is like Tuesday morning quarterbacking.<br />Another thing lacking from Johnson's book is any realistic solutions.  He raises interesting issues, and questions the usage of our power.  But, he does not address the contemporary political dangers threatening our planet.  Terrorists do exist.  Islamic insurrection is not an illusion.  North Korea's development of a nuclear arsenal is not fiction.  We should do something about those threats.  And, Johnson does not suggest anything.<br />In many respect, Johnson's book reminds me of 'Fear's Empire' by Benjamin Barber.  They both overreach in criticizing every minute aspect of our foreign policy.  But, they don't come up with truly sensible alternatives.  They are both somewhat blinded by their liberal perspectives.  In a sense, they counteract the equally ineffective 'An End to Evil' by David Frum, who is blinded by his own archconservative perspective.

They are both somewhat blinded by their liberal perspectives.  In a sense, they counteract the equally ineffective 'An End to Evil' by David Frum, who is blinded by his own archconservative perspective.  For my part, I recommend books written from a far more effective centrist perspective.  These include Wesley Clark's excellent 'Winning Modern Wars' and Robert Cooper's 'The Breaking of Nations.'	2004-01-29

The majority of them are written from a centrist to a liberal point of view.  These criticize the current Administration for being too unilateral, too neoconservative, and too aggressive in waging preemptive wars.<br />This book is unique as it takes an arch conservative over the top point of view.  The authors criticize the Administration according to the same parameters as the liberals, but in the symmetrical opposite direction.  They suggest that the Administration pays too much attention to the diverging opinion of its allies and enemies alike, and that it is too shy in waging military intervention.  In other words, the U.S. does not act unilaterally enough.  That's not something you will hear anywhere else but in this book.<br />They recommend regime changes not only with our enemies such as North Korea, and Iran, but also with allies who steadily oppose U.S. opinion such as France.  Regime changes can sometimes be justified, but it certainly can't just because representatives of a nation disagree with our President.  The authors just can't be serious.  Or, if they are, they should not be taken seriously.<br />If you want to read an excellent book on the subject, I recommend instead Wesley Clark's \\"Winning Modern Wars: Iraq, Terrorism, and the American Empire.'  This book is intelligent and balanced, two key qualities `An End to Evil' lacks.	2004-01-25

The popularity of intelligent academic like books dedicated to the subject has soared.  The American public seems finally to have caught up an insatiable thirst of knowledge for this esoteric subject.  This is undeniably a very good thing.  And, this book from Robert Cooper is an excellent tonic to quench this thirst for knowledge.  Cooper is an excellent writer.  His lively style renders his book easy to read.  Also, he is so erudite on his subject matter that the amount of information and knowledge he shares within this relatively short book is truly remarkable.<br />The core of the book is based on two essays Cooper wrote several years ago.  The first one \\"The Condition of the World\\" originally written in 1996 is somewhat the better structured of the two.  It develops a powerful foreign policy model by grouping nations into three categories.<br />The first category consists of \\"pre-modern states.\\"  These are completely dysfunctional.  They are typically broke, can't deliver any social services effectively, and the government's authority is often challenged by gangs, warlords, and other outlaws.  Many African countries come to mind.<br />The second category consists of \\"modern states.\\"  These are you regular sovereign nations working perfectly well on most counts.  This is Australia, Japan, Canada, you name it.<br />The third category consists of \\"post-modern states.\\"  This essentially describes the European Union, whereby a group of countries have agreed to relinquish some of their respective sovereign rights to a supranational political entity (EU) for the greater good of the respective community of countries.  In Cooper's views this category is obviously the higher political life form.  And, the other two \\"states\\" consist simply of sequential stepping stones towards this most evolved state.  This is obviously a questionable assumption.  Where Cooper sees the benefit of multilateralism, cooperation, free flowing trade within the EU.  Someone else could just as well see excessive bureaucracy, an extra layer of government, analysis-paralysis devoid of any effective foreign policy, and a trading block that actually reduces trade opportunity within a truly freer trade framework (WTO).  However, Cooper makes his case extremely well.  He is a formidable debater and does make a convincing case for his political framework and the superiority of the EU post-modern states structure.<br />Cooper somehow struggles a bit with the hegemonic status of the U.S.  He concedes that the U.S. stands \\"outside and above\\" the post-modern structure.  He also accepts that the world does indeed benefit from the U.S. protection umbrella.  Without a strong leader setting a set of rules and examples, the world could easily fall into chaos of competing power blocks vying for the top spot.  Thus, Cooper unlike many authors on the subject, finds himself both espousing European multilateralism and the American unilateralism.<br />His second essay, encapsulated within this book, has a much different overtone.  Its vision is a lot darker.  It reflects on a world becoming more dangerous, more uncertain, less manageable.  He believes humanitarian and military interventions in collapsing states will become maybe more frequent and more urgent.  Counter-terrorism will become potentially a permanent endeavor.  Government efforts to hunt down and grab WMD from the wrong hands will also be a long term effort.  His second essay, in style and vision, resembles a lot the excellent books written on the same subject by Robert Kaplan (The Coming Anarchy comes to mind).<br />In the end, this book may raises more issues, questions, and concerns than it answers.  I think there lies his great merit.  Contrary to many other authors who seem to know best about something as liquid and complex as foreign policy, Cooper's humbler attitude is refreshing.  He does not have the ready solution to all the world's problems.  But, he sure diagnoses these problems very skillfully.  He also asks the right questions and raises the correct concerns.  Finally, he also suggests the rather radical idea that European multilateralism and American unilateralism can cohabitate the Western World.

This is an excellent book that provides the best evidence that Early Admission programs boost your chance of admission.  The authors have conducted world-class research on this esoteric subject.  They support any of their hypotheses with a lot of data, graphs, tables, and references.  In other words, they don't make anything up.  And, they uncover a whole lot of stuff nobody else did.  Despite the somewhat quantitative and dry nature of this book, it is very easy to read given the very lively writing style of the authors.<br />This book fits a very unique niche within the college admission literature.  I can't think of any other book as a substitute.  However, I also recommend `A is for Admission' by Michele Hernandez.  In their own research, the authors mention this is one of the better and most honest books on college admission they came across.  I agree, as I have also studied that book in detail.  Nevertheless, `The Early Admission Game' given its much more narrow focus than your standard college admission guide drills down a lot deeper on acceptance rate probabilities, and other implications of the early admission programs at top schools.<br />Their research is unequivocal; applying Early Action (EA) is the equivalent of a 100-point boost in SAT score.  While applying Early Decision (ED) is the equivalent of a 150 + point boost in SAT score.  Most of the selective schools that use these programs refute this evidence.  They argue that the pool of students who apply early is much stronger, and that is why the acceptance rates are higher.  But, the authors' research strongly rebuts this.  To the contrary, they found there is very little difference between the early applicants and the regular ones.  They actually found that EA applicants were slightly stronger.  But, that ED was slightly weaker.<br />The book provides the best data I have ever seen on acceptance rates at the top schools.  The book gives you the whole distribution of acceptance rate given specific SAT score buckets.  For instance, Stanford's acceptance rate associated with SAT scores of 1400 is 9%.  This is true whether a student applies early or not.  Thus, in this case the SAT score is too low for the early admission benefit to kick in.  On the other hand, if an applicant has an SAT score between 1410 - 1450, the acceptance rate for an early applicant jumps to 40% that is essentially the same as for regular applicants with SAT score of 1510 - 1550.  Meanwhile, regular applicants with scores of 1410 - 1450 would get an acceptance rate of only 19%.  In other words, an applicant with an SAT score of 1410 to 1450 would more than double their chance of being accepted by applying early (a jump from 19% to 40%).<br />In essence, the early admission programs offer students a Faustian deal: apply early at a top school and you will get a much greater chance of being accepted.  On the other hand, you will probably have reduced or eliminated your choice of colleges, and you will limit your financial aid.  Indeed, when you apply early you give up your negotiation power within the financial aid game.  This is especially true for ED.  This does not mean you will not get financial aid.  But, your financial aid package will be limited to a basic \\"meets need\\" level.  This is probably less than if you could freely negotiate your financial aid package between two or three schools that accepted you.<br />Given the nature of this Faustian deal, it is logical that it is the wealthier students who apply early, and the minority students who apply later during regular admission.  Thus, the early admission programs have been deemed unfair and having severe social policy repercussion against minorities.  But, is this really the case?  The authors indicate that African Americans benefit from a staggering 400-point advantage.  In other words, the early admission program is just a mean for others to attempt to even out somewhat this \\"diversity\\" game.  And, as the research indicate the advantage of an African American is still between more than two to four times as great as any advantage obtained by early applicants. The ones who may suffer from the implication of early applications are not the minorities, but the lower middle class and middle class for whom financial aid is a material consideration.  This is the case for two reasons.  They are locked out of the acceptance advantage of ED.  And, also the acceptance rate for regular applicant is lowered the more a specific school uses early application to fill its freshman class.  And, that is tough.<br />Besides political correctness, there is no doubt you should apply early to your top choice \\"reach\\" school if you can afford it.  There are a couple of caveats however.  Make sure that your ED application is your first choice.  If you don't have a clear first choice, limit your early applications to EA only that do not bind you to matriculate at that school.  Also, make sure you can afford receiving a less than optimal financial aid package.  Finally, don't waste your EA or ED options.  Let's say you have a 1250 SAT score, don't waste your ED card on an Ivy League.  You are not in the ballpark.  Even with the advantage of early application, you just won't get in.  So, play your EA/ED card carefully by fully understanding the financial aid implications and the acceptance rate probability implications.rch indicate the advantage of an African American is still between more than two to four times as great as any advantage obtained by early applicants.

Bush, the White House, and the Education of Paul O'Neill	Books	5	127	138	N	N	Excellent insider view on the White House	Ron Suskind, thanks to Paul O'Neil, has written an excellent book giving us much insight on the inner workings of the White House.  Suskind is a former Wall Street Journal writer.  And, it shows.  The substance of the book is dense with information and documentation.  But, the prose is lively and easy to read.<br />According to the former Secretary of the Treasury, Bush and Cheney dominate the White House.  Bush leads based on stubbornly held personal opinions, and Cheney executes the plans reflecting the President's opinions.  Occasionally, Cheney feeds opinion to Bush when the latter has none to begin with.  But, everyone else is just there to make a case for supporting these same opinions.  Thus, most of the Presidential decisions are not well founded in objective intelligence.<br />Within this managerial climate, there is no room for intellectual debates, exchange of information, or even consensus building.  It is pretty much Bush and Cheney's ways or the highway.  Paul O'Neil, an intelligent, assertive, and independent thinker, did not fit within these parameters, and Cheney quickly showed him the next highway exit.<br />When Paul O'Neil was recruited as Secretary of the Treasury, he seemed to fit very well with the Administration.  He fit perfectly the mold of the old guard intelligentia who had reached the top level in business, with also much government experience.  He is definitely a conservative, pro business fellow.  He seemed just another of the old boys.  But, things did not turn out that way.<br />Paul O'Neil, an independent thinker, ended up clashing at every turn with the Administration.  He is a conservative.  But, that does not mean he is a unilateralist in foreign policy.  Thus, he felt highly uncomfortable with the lack of strong international support for our invading Iraq.<br />On the domestic front, O'Neil felt very uncomfortable with the progressive dismantling of our strong fiscal position we had inherited from the Clinton White House.  For him being conservative also means fiscally conservative.  It does not mean unraveling the Federal government.  O'Neil felt strongly that beyond the first tax cut that was necessary, the following rounds of tax cutes were dangerous as they created a rising structural budget deficit.<br />Finally, with his strong background in business and economics, he felt that the steel tariffs were totally unjustified and would trigger a rise in trade conflicts and unfruitful WTO trade negotiations.<br />If you objectively review O'Neil's positions, he is typically right.  And, the Bush-Cheney team is not.  Our level of unilateralism can easily be considered excessive.  The rounds of tax cuts were much too deep and did create a rising structural deficit.  Also, the steel tariffs did poison the WTO round at Cancun and the overall worldwide trading climate.  Recently, under pressure of penalties from the WTO, Bush had to eliminate these same steel trade tariffs.  The later did not achieve anything besides political embarrassment in the international arena.<br />Interestingly enough, the Bush-Cheney team has chosen not to address any of the issues raised by O'Neil.  But, instead they are conducting an investigation on potential government information leaks.  This is probably another effort to shut O'Neil's mouth once and for all.  But, the jack is out of the box.  Take advantage of it.  This is a must read during this Presidential election year.<br />This book also nicely complements other related recent books such as Paul Krugman's 'The Great Unraveling' and David Cay Johnston 'Perfectly Legal.'

This is an excellent book about the abusive influence of special interest groups on the U.S. tax code.  Thanks to their money, power, and influential political access, these special interest groups structure the U.S. tax code to their great advantage.  These tax favors include outright government subsidies and arcane tax loopholes.  These often do not have any social policy merit.  These tax give aways do not benefit society at large.  To the contrary, they hurt us big time.<br />Johnston makes a good case that these give aways have become so huge that they are in good part responsible for our $400 billion chronic structural deficit.  Businesses, corporations, and very high net worth individuals simply do not pay their fair share of taxes.  This is especially true when comparing their respective tax burden with their counterparts in other Western countries.  Johnston suggests that we will experience rising budget deficits if these structural flaws within the U.S. tax code are not corrected.  This book very nicely complements Paul Krugman's book `The Great Unraveling' where Krugman states that the ongoing reduction in taxes on the rich will unravel some of our most popular social programs such as Social Security and Medicare.<br />Johnston as the premier journalist on tax scams and schemes at the New York Times for the past seven years is perfectly equipped to write this book.  Many of the most egregious examples of tax schemes he mentions are taken directly from his NY Times columns.  The most vexing aspects of this issue is that these tax schemes that would be viewed as outright tax fraud in so many other industrialized countries are \\"Perfectly Legal\\" in the U.S.<br />Johnston, given his outstanding background in journalism, writes in an extremely lively way.  This makes the book both very entertaining and easy to read.  Given the occasionally dry subject matter this is quite an achievement.  Johnston does a great service by educating the voting public on how the system works.  This is most relevant during this Presidential campaign year.

This book could be subtitled &quot;What the Ivy League and elite private high schools do not want you to know.&quot;  Indeed, the author breaks so many myths about elite secondary and higher education that it is funny.  The author has a great sense of humor.  His writing style is very lively, and makes this book extremely easy to read.  Yet, he conveys very insightful information that you rarely find within other college guides.<br />The author refers to a study by Stacy Dale, who found no  difference in earnings between those students who had gone to Ivy league schools and those who had been accepted at those schools but had chosen to go elsewhere.  She even found some indications that students who had applied and been rejected by the very selective colleges were doing just as well twenty years later as those who had gotten in.  She named this phenomenon &quot;The Steven Spielberg Effect.&quot;  Indeed, Steven Spielberg was rejected by several of the top university film schools in Southern California.  He graduated from a no name school.  As they say, the rest is history.  Thus, Stacy Dale in her study concludes that it is not the selectivity of the school that one attends, but the character, talent, intelligence, and drive of the student that really matters.  The Ivies do not distinguish themselves by &quot;what&quot; they teach, but by &quot;who&quot; they teach.  Given that the author is a Harvard graduate, he has instant credibility regarding his insightful criticism of the Ivies.<br />Elite private high schools and magnet schools do not have any advantages vs. other public schools in sending their students to the elite colleges.  To the contrary, the author makes a case that they have a handicap.  This is because one of the key factors within the Ivy league admission process is class rank.  A student with a strong GPA in an average school will stand out, and earn a top class rank.  The same student with the same GPA would be lost in a crowd of overachievers at a top private school.  His class rank would be much lower, and will prevent him from being accepted at Ivy League schools.  Along the same lines, top schools are not comfortable admitting a high number of applicant from any one high school.  Thus, it is in your advantage to apply to the schools that your classmates do not apply to.  If they all apply to Yale, apply to Princeton instead.  This is tough, as it entails fighting the human herd instinct.  But, it puts the probability of being accepted very much in your favor.<br />The author warns about marketing tricks colleges use.  One of them is the &quot;Search letter&quot; that schools send to students with high PSAT scores.  All it means is that a school views you as an attractive applicant who will allow the school to boost its selectivity (reduce its acceptance rate) and increase its average SAT score of the admitted applicants.  Don't confuse this marketing gismo with a virtual guaranteed admission.  It is not.  The majority of search letter recipients are routinely turned down by the schools who sent these letters.  Another trick is the Wait list.  According to the author, the Wait list is a polite way for the school to tell you that they don't have room for you even though they acknowledge the outstanding caliber of your overall application.<br />The author offers a whole lot more information and guidance for both parents and students on how to survive and thrive through the stressful college admission process.  He also gives you a lot of information to maximize the chance of customer satisfaction (that students will like their college choice, and perform well).<br />Among the information provided, he includes a list of 100 schools.

The Greenes have written numerous college guides.  I have read a couple of them.  And, based on my firsthand experience they are excellent.  They typically address a specific topic.  Thus, they avoid or go beyond the bland generalities conveyed by other not so good college guides.<br />In this book, the Greenes focus on what they call the Hidden Ivies, or 30 schools that they consider meet the educational standards of the actual Ivies.  These are mainly top-notch small liberal arts colleges often located on the East Coast.  Within this list of 30 schools there are not any surprises.  These are very well established renowned institutions, which are often nearly as selective as the Ivy League themselves.  In other words, the Hidden Ivies are not so hidden.  Indeed, try getting in Amherst, Claremont McKenna, Pomona, or Middlebury.  If you can, one could argue you may as well apply to Yale, Princeton, and Harvard.<br />The Greenes make a good case that the Hidden Ivies offer a superior education that even the actual Ivies can't match.  This superior education is a liberal arts curriculum offered on small residential campuses where the institution is often dedicated solely to undergraduate students.  This is in contrast to the more prestigious Ivies where a significant amount of resources is diverted towards graduate programs and research.  The Greenes further advance their case by sharing the superior record that some of the smaller Hidden Ivies have in the % of their graduates they send on to complete PhDs.<br />This book is filled with very useful information, including: a) main tips for parents with a child going through the admission process at a Hidden Ivy, b) tips for students, c) tips on what it takes to get in, and d) indication for parents that the actual college choice was a success.<br />Also, the 30 school profiles are very extensive.  Each school is described in detail over 6 pages.  It is the result of an extensive survey of the faculty, the administration, and the students.  You get many direct quotes from students on how they like (or not) various aspects of their respective schools.  By reading these school profiles you will get an excellent idea if a specific school is the right fit for you (or your child).  And, for the Greenes, the proper school fit between student and college is far more important than the actual name recognition of the college.  In other words, a happy and successful student at Emory will have a far better start in his academic and professional life than his counterpart who may feel isolated and over pressured at Princeton.

This book covers a huge amount of information on this subject, including: a) what kind of college student will thrive at a large state university, b) what is the role of parents in supporting their children's public college experience, c) how to reap the maximum benefits from a public college education.  The authors analyze the major economic and demographic trends affecting public higher education.  The book provides much qualitative and quantitative information on the best 30 state universities in the U.S.<br />The authors suggest that to succeed in a large public university, students should develop a reflective style of learning.  This means learning by listening, reflecting, and reading.  This is because given the larger class size, public schools typically do not facilitate class discussions or have questions and answer sessions.  Also, students should be assertive so as to go after all the academic opportunities offered in large public schools.  These include terrific honors programs, study abroad programs, and summer internships.  Also, by being assertive, students can better develop valuable contacts with teachers, counselors, and mentors.  Finally, reaping a superior college experience in large institutions will require much self-discipline and drive.  This is because no one watches over you.  No one is going to tell you what you should do unless it is illegal.  No hand holding here unlike what a student could experience at a small private liberal arts college.<br />If a student abides by the advice mentioned within this book on how to succeed at a large state university, he can obtain a world-class education nearly comparable to the one offered by Ivy League schools at a fraction of the price.<br /><br />Also, the reviews on the various schools are excellent and give you enough data to differentiate between them.<br />The authors written style is very user friendly, and it makes some of this dry information very easy to absorb.

Such movements supposedly follow various patterns (either waves or fractals) that can be uncovered using technical analysis.  If this were the case, Prechter would have made a fortune in the stock market.  Instead, he has made one selling books with really poor advice.<br /><br />He positions himself as the Cassandra of the investment set.  The only problem is Cassandra had insights, meanwhile he has none.  Over 320 pages, Prechter pontificates about investment and economic theory, and geopolitics.  Subjects in which he has no well grounded knowledge whatsoever.<br /><br />Regarding fiscal policy, he mentions that the Feds have lowered interest rate to historically low levels to fight inflation.  This is wrong.  They lowered interest rate to fight off the risk of deflation.<br /><br />He states that no one has taken precautions to fight against deflation, simply because the establishment does not believe it could ever happen.  Again, this is all wrong.  Alan Greenspan has been most concerned about deflation for the past couple of years.  This is why he lowered short term rates to historically low levels.<br /><br />Prechter mentions that the money supply is growing way too fast.  He further attempts to explain that inflation is caused by the money supply expanding faster than the production of goods.  Well, obviously the money supply has not grown too fast relative to goods over the past decade and a half, given that we have had exceptionally tame inflation during this period.  Again the current risk right now is not runaway inflation, it is deflation.<br /><br />Regarding his investment recommendation, Prechter is not anymore proficient than in economic theory.  He recommends you get out of all bonds and stocks investments, and reinvest everything in cash and precious metals.  This advice is nonsensical.  By following such an investment mix, you will not keep up your purchasing power over time.  And, you will have a significant exposure to an investment that is purely speculative (gold).  Mr. Prechter is a \\"Gold Bug\\" such an investment strategy has been out of date for decades.  Owning a bit of gold may be OK, but to make it a major portion of your stock portfolio is financially really dangerous.  He even recommends that you cash out your retirement plan and reinvest it after incurring hefty tax penalties in cash and gold.  This is because he considers that there is a high risk the Government will confiscate your retirement assets.  That is just not a real possibility.<br /><br />Regarding geopolitics, Mr. Prechter states that 9/11 was the result of a worldwide economic downturn.  He has never heard of Wahhabism in Saudi Arabia that preaches the most extreme and violent interpretation of the Koran.  Such Saudi Arabian Wahhabists accounted for 15 of the 19 terrorists of 9/11.  The causes of 9/11 had nothing to do with an upcoming economic downturn.  But, 9/11 certainly precipitated the worldwide economic downturn.  Mr. Prechter confuses cause and effect here.  And, thinks he is a contrarian genius because of it.  I don't think so.<br /><br />If you want to read books on investment theory, I suggest the excellent books by Burton Malkiel: [[ASIN:0393330338 A Random Walk Down Wall Street: The Time-Tested Strategy for Successful Investing, Ninth Edition]] and [[ASIN:039332639X The Random Walk Guide To Investing]].

Its material on globalization is very limited and would have been more appropriately covered in a  single article within The Economist or BusinessWeek.<br />The book is mainly a critique of the International Monetary Fund (IMF).  The author indicates that the IMF was created in 1947, shortly after the Bretton Woods Conference of 1944.  It's purpose was to enforce the rules of an elaborate system of currency and capital controls under a Fixed Exchange Rate System.  However in 1971, this Fixed Exchange Rate System was succeeded by the Floating Exchange Rate System.<br />According to Stiglitz, this change from fixed to floating exchange rate rendered the IMF original mission completely obsolete.  Back in 1971, the IMF should have closed its doors, and its staff should have moved on to more fruitful ventures.  But, the IMF did not close down.  Instead, it recycled itself into an international foreign aid agency implementing Western economic reforms, including: 1) privatization of government assets and utilities, 2) deregulation of markets,  3) free trade and opening up of  domestic markets, and 4) liberalization of capital markets.  Stiglitz refers to these measures as the &quot;Washington Consensus.&quot;<br />Stiglitz analysis of the IMF performance is right on the mark.  It is true that the IMF economic interventions have had poor results.  Whenever they structured a country's bailing out, they typically have enforced the reverse policies that Allan Greenspan and Congress would have taken to get our U.S. economy out of a recession.  For example, the IMF standard cure is to implement an increase in interest rates to shore up the currency value.  It is also to promote a balanced fiscal budget and a balanced current account.  The problem is that this standard package of policy is recessionary, and will further exacerbate an economic crisis.  So, here Stiglitz is right.<br /><br />However, Stiglitz crosses the line when he mounts a relentless polemical attack on the &quot;Washington Consensus.&quot;  One could easily deduct that he stands for the opposite, which would be: 1) nationalization of private commercial assets, 2) reregulation of markets, 3) protectionism, and 4) foreign exchange and capital markets controls.  Within a post WWII framework, no country has ever succeeded following such anti Washington Consensus economic policies.<br />After reading this book, one can see why he was fired from the World Bank.  He comes across as arrogant.  He could have written an excellent article regarding the failures of the IMF.  Instead he wrote a weak polemic book attacking capitalism.<br />If you want to read an excellent and more balanced account of globalization, I suggest &quot;The Lexus and the Olive Tree&quot; by Thomas Friedman.  This book is also so much broader in scope than Stiglitz book.he line when he mounts a relentless polemical attack on the &quot;Washington Consensus.&quot;  One could easily deduct that he stands for the opposite, which would be: 1) nationalization of private commercial assets, 2) reregulation of markets, 3) protectionism, and 4) foreign exchange and capital markets controls.

In his view, Ivy leagues are way over rated.  Their reputation is perpetrated by the college rankings of U.S. News.  According to Mr. Pope, such rankings are almost irrelevant as they don't measure in any way the quality of education provided to the students by such schools.  But, they reinforce the reputation of schools which drive up application numbers, which in turn allows these \\"top\\" schools to become increasingly selective, and further boosts their U.S. News ranking.  For Mr. Pope this is a self reinforcing not so virtuous cycle.<br />Mr. Pope instead recommends to look at the multitude of excellent small liberal arts college located in the Midwest, South, and West that are not so well known.  Because they are less well known, their respective acceptance rates are way higher than for their better known counterparts back East and the Ivy league.  Yet, they often provide a just as good if not superior college education.  Their professors are fully dedicated to teaching undergraduates.  This is unlike in the Ivy league whose professors are more dedicated to research, publication, consulting, and PhD candidates.<br />The above concepts are really mind opening and powerful.  Where Mr. Pope's book falls short, is that his data is more than 20 years out of date.  This is difficult to overlook or forgive given that he \\"updated\\" his book in 1995, yet his data covers the period from 1951 to 1980.  So, at the time of the book's second publication, this book's data was already 15 years out of date.  One has to wonder why he did not bother to update the data.  It would have made his book so much better.<br />With outdated data Mr. Pope inevitably makes many embarassing college recommendations.  Many of the schools he is so crazy about, are now really poor educational performers that should have been screened out of any truly updated edition of this book.  As an example, Antioch College in Ohio has a really poor freshman retention rate of 66%.  This is the lowest freshman retention rate I have come across in my researching colleges.  Similarly, in his other related book \\"Colleges that Change Lives\\" after doing some research, I screened out 20 of the 40 mentioned (or 50%) because of either low freshman retention rate, low graduation rate, and low percentage of graduates going on to graduate schools.book.

This list of colleges gives you a great incentive to explore small liberal arts colleges not only back East but all over the country.  That is a good thing.<br />On the other hand, some of his information is out of date.  Out of the 40 recommended colleges, I found myself screening out 20 of them because of either low freshman retention rate, low graduation rate, and low percentage of graduates going on to graduate schools.  In other words, half of these recommended schools are actually poor college educational performers.  This is obviously way too high a failure percentage (50%) to give this book any higher rating than I have.	2003-12-22

This book provides excellent and entertaining background on several of the leading 2004 democratic presidential candidates.  The author believes there is much to be learned from the \\"invisible primary\\" period of 2002 and early 2003, because the candidates were much more accessible and they spoke much more candidly.<br />However, politics moves quickly.  At the time the book was written, the modern Internet based campaign of Howard Dean had not taken off yet.  Also, the book did not capture the late entry of Wesley Clark.  So, by the time you get to read this newly released book, it will be more a piece of recent political history, than any plausible prognostic on the likely democratic nominee.  This should not detract much from the valuable background on the candidates and the changing dynamic of presidential campaigning.  The author very user friendly lively narrative written style reflects his background as one of the U.S. premier political journalist and writers.  If you are a politics aficionado, you will love the book.	2003-12-21

This is an excellent book that dismisses many cultural myths that are increasingly embedded in the minds of the masses.  It is a well known fact that bad news sell better than good ones.  The media and the press have exploited this fact excessively for many decades.<br />According to what one reads in the paper, magazines, and books the American middle class is loosing ground.  The U.S. is falling behind foreign competitors on many counts.  Globalization is bad as it costs US jobs.  There is a rapidly growing poverty stricken underclass.<br />Gregg Easterbrook actually studied the demographic and economic data and concludes that the statements mentioned in the second paragraph are plain wrong.  The truth is that the U.S. economy is growing, and its labor productivity is the envy of the World.  With faster labor productivity we have a faster rising living standard in the U.S. than in Japan and Europe.  The U.S. has benefited tremendously from globalization and free trade, as it has been able to replace any low-income jobs by much higher income ones.  In summary, the U.S. economy is the envy of the World and so is our living standard.<br />Greg Easterbrook further makes his case that our current generation in our current time has it better than any of our American predecessors.  Our middle class is not shrinking, it is growing.  Similarly, the poverty stricken underclass is shrinking.  Our living standard on all counts has risen tremendously over the past century.  Homeownership has risen, so as car ownership, and the ownership of increasingly more practical home appliances. The level of innovation in our society is unprecedented, and makes it for a much more exciting, yet comfortable, and convenient society to live in.<br />Greg Easterbrook's style makes it for a very pleasant and easy reading experience.  If you are interested about building a portfolio of sound arguments for political, and intellectual debates buy this book.  You will be that much more informed and smarter than your friends who have not read it.informed and smarter than your friends who have not read it.	2003-12-20

The three coauthors include two physicists and one tennis pro.  They are all avid tennis players.  They also have incredibly investigative minds.  The book consists of about 40 different articles covering many different technical subjects regarding stroke mechanics, ball bounce, racquets, and strings.  All these articles represent serious investigation and research from a physicist standpoint.  These articles stand on their own independently.  As a result, you do not need to read them in sequential order.  You also don't need to read them all to extract the information you care about.  For my part, I skipped some of the articles on the physics of ball bounce, but was very interested on all the articles regarding strings and racquets properties.  Depending on your own personal interest, you may read or focus on different sets of articles.  Given the rather dry subject, the writing style of the authors make the information easy to digest.<br />Contrary to what players believe, racquets have very similar power.  Strings, regardless of tension and type have also very similar power.  But, different strings can feel very different based on their respective stiffness.  Gut and high quality nylon strings feel soft because they are relatively flexible.  Kevlar does not feel so good, because they are the stiffest strings.<br />According to the authors, the pros don't use any of the high-tech latest models, including oversize, and widebody frames. They use older models customized with lead tape to add swingweight.  Oversize racquets are not maneuverable enough at their playing speed.<br />The authors state throughout the book that racquets that are stiff strung at low tension feel better.  A stiff racquet vibrates less.  Its vibrations have a faster frequency. The ball sits longer on low tension strings than the fast vibration of a stiff racquet.  As a result, both string and frame vibrations are dampened by the longer impact time of the ball.  Thus, the least amount of vibration occurs in stiff racquets strung at low tension.<br />The book has a whole lot more of interesting information about tennis than I share in the above paragraphs.  If you love the game, and are somewhat of a quantitative type, you will love this book.s are dampened by the longer impact time of the ball.

The arguments don't make sense.	There are plenty of excellent books criticizing U.S. policies.  This is not one of them.  The author arguments fall apart under scrutiny.  These include: a) The U.S. is experiencing an inevitable economic decline due to its chronic trade deficit.  It is waging wars worldwide solely to maintain its arbitrary will to import cheap goods; b) Europe is the World number one economic power; c) Japan is the economic model by excellence due to a high domestic private savings rate and large trade surpluses; d) Russia will regain its status as a World Power due to its vast oil reserves, and its trade surpluses; e) The Middle East will democratize by itself due to declining demographic growth, and women's rising literacy rates.<br /><br />Emmanuel Todd defends most of the above arguments based on trade balance alone.  He belongs to a group of French economists called Mercantilists.  They believe you can look at trade balances in isolation.  Judging solely on this one measure, he comes to the quick conclusion that the economies of Europe, Russia and Japan are in great shape, and that the U.S. one is in terrible shape.  But, trade is just one measure.  It is not the whole story.<br /><br />Adam Smith, in `Wealth of Nations' proved the Mercantilists wrong back in 1776.  So, Emmanuel Todd arguments are more than two hundred years out of date.  Adam Smith indicated that labor productivity is far more important to creating wealth of a nation than is trade balances.  Adam Smith was the first promoter of free trade, attempting to overcome the predominant protectionism beliefs of the time.<br /><br />But, Emmanuel Todd is a protectionist.  He states free trade has lowered the living standards of workers worldwide.  You won't find any established economist holding such view.  For a simple reason, it does not hold up to the data.<br /><br />Within the field of comparative international economics, Emmanuel Todd avoided mentioning any measurements of economic growth, GDP per capita, and labor productivity.  Had he looked at any of these measures, his comparative analysis of the U.S. vs. Europe, Japan, and Russia would have unraveled.<br /><br />Contrary to Emmanuel Todd's stand, the U.S. is not experiencing a relative economic decline, and a weakening military.  Over the past two decades the U.S. GDP per capita has grown much faster than Japan and Europe.  The U.S. economic growth is boosted by a high capital investment rate (from both domestic and foreign sources), rising labor productivity associated with flexible labor markets.  Demographic and fiscal factors are also supportive of the U.S. maintaining its faster economic growth relative to Europe and Japan.<br /><br />Europe is not bypassing the U.S. in economic performance.  Instead, it is falling further behind because of inflexible labor markets and slower labor productivity and economic growth.  Europe economic growth rate has steadily declined since the seventies.  Over the same period, the U.S. economic growth rate has been much stronger.<br /><br />Emmanuel Todd's vision of Japan as the perfect economic model is laughable and over twenty years out of date.  Since 1989, Japan's economy has been stagnant with flat or negative economic growth.  Also, Japan is a fiscal basket case.  For the past several years, its budget deficit has been 6% of GDP, compared to only 3.5% for the U.S. in 2003.  Japan government debt as a % of GDP is more than double the U.S. level.  Japan's banking system is bankrupt.  Japan needs to reform its banking system, capital markets, and reign in its government spending.  But, its political system does not encourage any such reform.<br /><br />The Middle East will not democratize itself on its own because of declining fertility rates and rising literacy rates.  The Middle East is stuck with a combination of unfavorable demographic forces, including high fertility rates, women being repressed and lacking access to education.  This combined with flat economic growth, results in a youth demographic bulge that is unemployed and frustrated.  Many of these youths become terrorists.<br /><br />Russia as a rebounding World power is another weak argument.  With a GDP per capita of only $2,403 (OECD  data. 2002), it is a third World country in disguise.  Additionally, Russia is experiencing a demographic crisis (rapid shrinking in population) that may unravel any economic progress it has made in the past few years.  But, to Emmanuel Todd, Russia is doing great solely because it has a trade surplus due to high oil prices and related export earnings.  The minute oil prices dip, Russia has nothing to fall back on.<br /><br />As a demographer, Emmanuel Todd missed the most important trend: aging.  This demographic trend will have far more influence on the relative economic strengths of the U.S., Europe, and Japan, than whether the U.S. has a trade deficit of 4% or 5%.  Currently, France spends 15.8% of its GDP on the Elderly vs. only 9.4% for the U.S.  This represents a 6.4% of GDP handicap relative to the U.S.  This handicap is expected to increase to 9.0% (29.3% vs. 20.3%) by 2040.  Trends with other European countries are similar.  Concerning the fiscal impact of aging population, U.S. demographics are more favorable than European ones.<br /><br />Todd also completely overlooked the emergence of China and India.  Including those would have further eroded his European-centric bias.  There are more omissions and mistakes within the book.  But, by now you get the point.

Since 1973 Detroit has lost market niches and market shares to foreign brands due to inept management.  In the seventies, Detroit lost out the fuel-efficient market. In the eighties, Detroit lost out the sedans market.  In the 1990s, foreigners gained in the minivans, SUV, and luxury car markets.  Managerial mediocrity and lagging technology has sunk Detroit.  Foreigners are more efficient producers of higher quality car, with better styling.<br /><br />While foreign manufacturers' CEOs are engineers focused on manufacturing, research, design, teamwork, and continuous improvements; American CEOs are financiers focused on economies of scales.  The foreign engineers deliver quality, strong consumer ratings, and long term consumer satisfaction.  The American financiers attempt to deliver short-term profit margins, but have instead suffered devastating losses and loss in market shares.<br /><br />Foreigners (Toyota, Honda) are loyal in supporting their main brand name (Camry, Accord) to retain core customers.  Americans are not so concerned as Ford torpedoed their most valuable brand name (Taurus) for higher short term profits in SUVs.  Meanwhile, Camry and Accord remain the dominating sedan brand to this day.<br /><br />Maynard does an excellent job of differentiating the corporate culture and engineering feats of the main foreign manufacturers.  Overall, the foreigner onslaught is lead by Honda and Toyota.  Their respective successes overshadows everyone else.  She mentions that repeat customers account for 65% of sales at Honda, 50% of sales at Toyota, but only 28% at Nissan.  Also Asian manufacturers sell 43% of their cars to customers who formerly owned American cars.  Meanwhile, the Big Three sell only 10% of their cars to customers who owned Asian ones and that is typically a pick up truck or a SUV not replacing the Asian sedan.  That kind of math will cause a continuing crippling loss of market share for Detroit.<br /><br />Detroit's main competitive strategy is price discounting, including: 0% financing, rebates, and wholesaling to rental companies.  Such a strategy is a disaster as it hurts cars resale value and customer loyalty.  As things go, the Americans are positioning themselves to become low quality high volume wholesale provider to the rental companies leaving the more lucrative retail consumer markets to foreigners.  The big problem is that American manufacturers have not demonstrated this is a financially viable solution as they are incurring crippling losses by doing so.<br /><br />Foreigners competitive strategy entails pouring $ millions into R&D and market research. Thus, they have developed a huge technological lead, and have a better understanding of American consumers taste than Detroit. Honda and Toyota have produced hybrids for over ten years.  By 2002, Honda, Toyota and Nissan have already sold their first fuel cell autos to government fleets.  Meanwhile, Detroit has yet to be competitive in hybrids.  Foreign manufacturers technological lead will soon be measured in decades.<br /><br />Maynard does mention that unionized labor has caused the Big Three to become highly inefficient.  With unionized labor the Big Three have a $1,200 per car handicap in legacy costs (health care and pension benefits of older workers and retirees).  Young workers wage and benefits are not so different vs non-union plants.  Also, the UAW has plagued manufacturers profitability since the 1980s.  Japanese manufacturers developed more efficient modular assembly techniques even in the U.S.  The Big Three could not adopt this technology because the UAW forbid it given the resulting large job savings.  As a result a unionized plant needs 50% more workers than a non unionized one.  During downturns, UAW workers still get nearly full pay during layoffs.<br /><br />She also mentioned the U.S. dealers problem.  The Big Three dealer network is way too big with much excess capacity.  And, the dealers prevent the Big Three from streamlining their models lined up.  They sued GM to maintain the Oldsmobile division.<br /><br />The overarching main problem is poor strategy and terrible design.  Honda and Toyota have produced excellent cars in the U.S. for decades using American labor.  This underlines that Detroit's problems are managerial.<br /><br />Update as of 2009:<br />Maynard quoted several predictions that were to occur by 2010.  They all did!  She anticipated foreigners would account for over 50% of auto sales.  They passed that benchmark in 2008 with a 52.8% share.  She indicated at least one of Detroit's big three will not continue in the same form.  Currently, all big three will need major government support to survive.  She also indicated that Toyota would take the number one spot in World sales from GM.  It did that in 2007.  Let alone that Toyota is far more profitable and on sounder financial footing than GM that is near bankruptcy.<br /><br />Frankly, none of those predictions were that challenging.  They reflected what was already painfully obvious back in 2002.

US	52977415	RZ8BBE7JJS9EI	0446674060	833316395	A Is for Admission: The Insider's Guide to Getting into the Ivy League and Other Top Colleges	Books	5	194	210	N	N	Excellent book with more insights than any other I have read	Many reviewers indicated this is the best book on the subject.  I agree.  Why is it better than the other ones?  There are several reasons, as described in the following paragraphs.<br />The author is a true insider, as she was an admission officer at Dartmouth for four years.  She uncovers many insights about Ivy League admission that the other books do not.<br />By reading this book, you will get an in depth knowledge about peculiar formulas used by the Ivies, including the Academic Index, and its subset the Converted Rank Score (CRS).  The CRS indicates that the Ivies do not care so much about GPAs, which at the top level does not differentiate between candidates, but they care instead about class rank.<br />Another factor that is key is the strength of your curriculum (honors and AP classes).  If you took easy classes to get As, forget it, your 4.0 GPA will be discounted accordingly.<br />According to the author, test scores are crucial.  They account for 2/3 of the Academic Index points.  And, academic factors account for 70 to 85% of the overall admission decision.  Also, the SAT IIs  are as important as the SAT Is.  This is a fact most ignore by over preparing for the SAT Is by spending big bucks on prep classes (Princeton Review, Kaplan, etc...) , but not spending much energy on preparing for the SAT IIs.  This is a major strategic error.<br />It goes without saying that the Ivy League is incredibly competitive.  The average SAT score of the Dartmouth freshman class is 1415!  So, to distinguish yourself as a better than average applicant you have to score over 1430 on your SATs and do equally well on your SAT IIs.  Obviously, this is no small feat for common mortals.<br />What makes the admission game even harder is that so many applicants get accepted under preferential treatments.  About 39% of the freshman class at Dartmouth got in under such favored status.  These include athletes on scholarship, legacy students, VIPs, and minorities.  If you are among any of these groups, it will be significantly easier for you to get in; otherwise, refer to the paragraph just above.<br />The acceptance rate between applicants coming from public schools and private ones is virtually the same.  So, save your money for college tuition.  Expensive elite private schools do not have an inside track to the Ivies, regardless of what they say in their ads.<br />If you are on the Wait List, or are a Transfer applicant, unless you are very idealistic and bounce back well from setbacks, you better forget it.  Both situations stack the odds against you big time.<br />A much more favorable position is to be a strong candidate and go the Early Admission or Decision route.  The author shares excellent data indicating that in all cases with all the Ivy League schools the acceptance rate during the ED period is nearly double the one during the regular period.<br />Another excellent characteristic of this book is that the author shares a most balanced perspective on extra curricular factors, including: community involvement, essay, letter of recommendation, and interview.  Essentially, if you are a top-notch applicant, these factors will really not matter much.  If you are a not so good one, it won't matter either.  You will not make the cut.  But, if you are in the grey area, then a brilliant essay, great letter of recommendations, out of this world interview may be tipping points in your favor.  Yet, all of those intangibles may not even help you out if you are Wait listed.<br />In conclusion, this is an excellent book that gives you a most realistic assessment of what the admission process is like at Ivy League schools.  There are really no tricks, no short cuts, you just have to be a world-class student.  As described, you will get much insight about this mysterious admission process.  But, better awareness does not mean you can crack the game.  In this respect, this book is a cut above other ones who convey that an excellent essay or excellentletter of recommendation can make up for relative mediocrity in the more important academic areas.  This is just not true.  And, this book tells you why.lent essay or excellent letter of recommendation can make up for relative mediocrity in the more important academic areas.

Indeed, Nobel prized winning economists such as Stiglitz don't take it nicely to being outsmarted by common mortals (not so common if you look at the whole persona).  The truth of the matter is that \\"In an Uncertain World...\\" is a far better book than Stiglitz rampaging book on the same subject \\"The Roaring Nineties.\\"  I'll let you read my review on this book for further details.<br />If you ran a database query of the smartest people on Wall Street and Washington, at the top cross section stands one remarkable individual, Robert Rubin.  The book reflects the quality of the man's intellect and judgment.<br />Additionally, Rubin had great courage.  Contrary to O' Neil and Snow the two Secretaries of the Treasury during Bush first term, who have been just salesmen for Bush tax cuts; Rubin shaped the fiscal policies during the Clinton administration.  Rubin was not shy to oppose Clinton's views on unrestrained government spending.  Rubin convinced Clinton of the benefits to generate a Budget Surplus to pay down Government debt before it would spiral out of control with the upcoming retirement of the Baby Boomers early in the next century.<br />Rubin also knew that the real boss was not Clinton but the Bond market.  He knew that profligate government spending, continuing rise in Budget Deficits, and a rise in Government bond issuance would be punished by the Bond market with sharp increase in long term interest rates.  This in turn, would curtail capital investment, productivity, economic growth, and employment.  He also knew that the reverse was true too.  An improvement in the U.S. fiscal position would be rewarded by the Bond market with lower long term interest rates, resulting in faster sustainable economic growth and higher employment.<br />In essence, Rubin is a Keynesian with a twist.  He recognizes that Budget deficits can have a healthy expansionary impact during a recession.  However, his concern is related to structural deficits (as opposed to cyclical deficits).  In other words, when a country's fiscal position is chronically in the red, even in good times, you run into a vicious cycle.  Government borrowings (increasing demand for money) will boost the price of money (interest rate) over time.  As a result, interest rates rise, private investments decline, productivity drops, and GDP growth slows down.  Because of the lower growth, Deficits rise further, so does government borrowings, and the beat goes on.<br />When Rubin looks at the U.S. fiscal position over the medium term, it gets really worrisome.  Indeed, Rubin addresses the issue of the Baby Boomers upcoming retirement in the second decade of this century and thereafter.  Here, Rubin correctly looks at the U.S. fiscal position as a pension fund.  In other words, both will have to meet large claims associated with retirees.  Thus, they should build right now enormous reserves (accumulated surpluses) to withstand these huge upcoming costs.<br />Rubin put the country's money exactly where his mouth is.  Indeed, when he joined the Clinton administration, he inherited a huge structural deficit from 12 years of the Reagan era.  Within eight years, he turned the U.S. fiscal position with \\"surpluses as far as the eye can see\\" to get ready for the Baby Boomer retirement.  As we know, the Bush administration after three tax cuts, two of them unnecessary and irresponsible, did an abrupt return to the Reagan era, the sequel.  Sequels are always worst than the original.  This is no exception.  And, that is because now we are virtually out of time before being flooded with the tsunami of Baby Boomers retirement costs.  At the end of the Reagan era, we had over twenty years to shore up our fiscal position, now we have less than ten years.  The swing in the fiscal position between the end of the Clinton/Rubin era and the first term of Bush is a staggering $10 trillion.  When Clinton left the office, the Surpluses over the next ten years were estimated at over $5 trillion.  Now, under Bush watch, the fiscal position has swung to Deficits over the next ten years of $5 trillion.  Rubin thinks this swing has dire consequences, including downward pressure on the value of the dollar which will eventually erode the confidence of foreign investors.  In turn, this will make it increasingly difficult for the U.S. to finance its current account deficit.<br />He notes that the Budget Deficit and the Current Account Deficit are close twins.  The Budget Deficit decreases domestic savings, and increases the gap between domestic savings and investments.  This gap is financed by foreign direct investment which is equal to the Current Account Deficit.<br />The book covers a lot more ground on his several decades of experience in investment banking and risk arbitrage at Goldman Sachs.  It covers also very intriguing aspects about Washington.  If you are interested in politics and economics, you will love this book.s retirement costs.

This is an excellent book on the history of the Democratic party.  One marvel of American democracy is the durability of its founding principles. The same consistency doesn't apply to the nation's two major political parties. The Democratic Party, created in the factional tumult of post-revolutionary days, has changed from a predominantly rural, racist, states' rights party into an organ of urban minorities, liberals, and federal power. The one constant among Democrats was best identified by Will Rogers: &quot;I belong to no organized party. I am a Democrat.&quot;<br />Witcover writes at length of the key figures in Democratic annals such as Thomas Jefferson, Andrew Jackson, William Jennings Bryan, and FDR, with an eye for details that bring history to life. His description of the ailing Roosevelt's duplicitous scheming to replace Vice President Henry A. Wallace with Missouri Senator Harry S Truman in 1944 offers insight into the great Democrat's character. But Witcover also devotes space to important but lesser-known figures: Martin Van Buren, for instance, was a wily New York Senator whose skillful 1828 promotion of Andrew Jackson's war-hero image paved the way for modern electioneering.<br />Although Witcover, a liberal columnist, is sympathetic to the Democrats, he doesn't hesitate to condemn the party's dark moments. A particularly odious Democrat, in Witcover's mind, is 15th President James Buchanan, a virulent racist who, in the years just before the Civil War, blamed national friction on the Northern abolitionists he said were stirring up slaves with hopes of freedom.	2003-11-16

Read why.	A recent article in Atlantic Monthly indicated that the author is probably the highest paid private admissions counselor.  She charges $32,995 for a special counseling package that lasts two years to assure the best chance that students do get in into the Ivy league.  She states that she has a success rate of 75%.  She also indicates that for anyone who does not have that type of money, all her strategies are disclosed within this book.<br />This is an excellent book on the subject.  The author has a rich and diverse background on the topic, and it shows.  She approaches the subject from many different angles.  There are a lot of good books on college admissions.  They typically cover all the basics well, including the quantitative factors (GPAs, tests) and the qualitative ones (extra curricular activities, essays, letters of recommendations, interviews).<br />But, with this book the author went the extra mile on every aspects.  For instance, on GPAs, she gives you so many interesting insights that you realize there are many qualitative dimensions to the GPA itself.  A 4.0 is not always equal to another 4.0.  Sometimes a 3.5 makes for a stronger candidate than a 4.0.  It depends on the difficulty of the classes the student has taken.  It also depends from what high school the student graduated.  The trends in grade is also really important.  And, class rank can also play a material role.<br />She also explains all the different admission channels such as Early Action, Early Decision, and Rolling Admission (I had never read of this last one in any other books).  She goes on explaining clearly when to use these specific entry channels and when not to.  If a student is fully ready, prepared, and committed to a first choice school, and the family has adequate college financing in place, the Early Decision channel may be very advantageous.  But, the reverse is true too.  She also explains why colleges love Early Decision programs.  Such programs allow universities to boost their student yield (Enrolled students/Accepted students) and increase their selectivity with lower acceptance rates (Accepted students/Applying students).  The student yield and acceptance rates are metrics that play a key role in many college rankings, including U.S. News.<br />The book has also an invaluable section on college information on the Web.  There you will learn about a company who sells objective 1 hour tapes on college tours of specific schools.  So, you can get the down and dirty about many schools, and really learn a whole lot about them without having to spend thousands of dollars on a coast to coast family campus visit tour.  These videos are not advertising, they are almost more like a \\"60 minutes\\" reportage on a school.  I will definitely buy four or five such videos to visit some far away campuses in the comfort of our living room.  Other recommended website let you find out in an instant if your family financial profile make you eligible for \\"need based\\" financial aid or not.  In short, if 12% of the parents net worth (including home equity) plus 35% of the applicant's assets exceed the college cost, you are out of luck.  You will not received \\"need based\\" financial aid.  The applicant can still receive \\"merit based\\" financial aid.  But, that is a whole different story, and a lot more competitive one at that.<br />Regarding tests, the book gives you tips on how to improve your score on any test.  Additionally, that was the first book I read which when it was published back in 2001 and 2002, announced that the SAT I was getting overhauled in 2005 with a new written verbal section, including an essay worth an extra 800 points.  So, now a perfect score on the SAT I will be 2400 (1600 formerly).<br />The book is also big on the interview section.  Many other authors treat the interview as the least important link in the college admission process.  This author thinks differently.  To the contrary, she feels that one should get prepared for the college admission process in a very similar way as the job hunting process.  Thus, the interview is key in making a strong personal impression.  In her experience, she indicated that good or bad interviews did make a difference in the college admission process.<br />To conclude, any family with college bound kids will greatly benefit from learning the information within this book.hould get prepared for the college admission process in a very similar way as the job hunting process.

This is a very good book on the AOL Time Warner merger.  This merger is unusual, because it is the acquirer (AOL) that got weakened much more than the acquired (Time Warner).  Also interesting, it is not so obvious why that was the case.  Right after the merger, the AOL executives got the upper hand over the Time Warner ones.  This was logical, and was a confirmation of who bought up whom.  So, given that the AOL executives had the upper hand, and that AOL was doing great before the merger, what triggered the demise of the company post merger?<br />The author makes a well detailed and successful case that the unraveling of AOL was associated with the bitterness of the Time Warner executives as the result of not being treated as equals.  As a result, they conducted a quiet mutiny by consciously underperforming on all the projects and ventures related to AOL.  And, they succeeded marvelously.<br />The author also makes a case that AOL is not over.  And, that it has still a bright future within the internet and technology domain.  Here the author is on much thinner ice.  Her case is more about subjectivity and personal likings than anything else.<br />Nevertheless, this book is overall an excellent and easy read.  The author style is very lively and makes for a fast page turner.  It is also very personal.  She seems to know and meet everyone in the industry and have interesting personal opinions on them all.  This renders the book so much more interesting then just an extended Harvard case study which so many books of this type end up becoming.	2003-11-08

It was written by two very young adults who recently went through this grueling college admission process and succeeded beyond anyone wildest dreams.  Indeed, the two coauthors were accepted to every school they applied including Harvard and all the other Ivy League schools.  They also won over $100,000 in merit based scholarships.  So, these guys are unquestionably the champs of the college admission game.  They are the Michael Jordan of the college admission set.<br />They show you how they did it.  Essentially, it is by leaving much less to chance than any of the other applicants.  They show a level of readiness, preparedness, thoroughness, and maturity that is uncanny.  Their attitude and methodology will make you not only successful in your college admission process, but in business, and life.<br />One of the keys is to realize that success is dependent on both quantitative factors (GPAs, test scores) and qualitative factors (extracurricular achievements, essays, and evaluations).  In most aspect in life this is also true; you need a good mix of IQ and EQ to succeed.  The authors actually make a case that the essay may be the most important part of the application.  They state that in terms of getting into the top schools, a great essay can make up for a mediocre GPA (anything is relative, I think we are talking about a 3.4 GPA).  But, an excellent GPA (4.0) can not make up for a poor essay.  Evaluations are also critical.  Again, the authors leave very little to chance, and show you a neat way to make your recommenders write you first class evaluations (give them a banzai resume, show them an article on writing recommendation, etc...).<br />This is the first book I read on this subject.  And, `Get Into College' has set the bar extremely high for all other books on this subject.	2003-11-06

Stiglitz attacks Wall Street, big business, and free-market economists. They didn't just screw up globalization, he says. They also messed up on electricity deregulation, stock options, pension reform, accounting scandals, the merger of commercial and investment banking, and the budget deficit. He dismisses the '90s boom as \\"hyperactivity\\" that was based mainly on regulatory and accounting manipulations. As you will see, his case is often flawed.<br />Stiglitz argues the liberal Clintonites were steamrolled by Republicans and by Democrats with a Wall Street agenda. His nemesis is Robert Rubin, Treasury Secretary. Stiglitz says that there's no evidence that deficit reduction was the cause of the '90s boom. And he argues that a fetish for surpluses caused the Clinton team to abandon important goals, such as strengthening schools.<br />Here, Stiglitz is way off. Clinton regained the political center thanks to the conservative fiscal policies of Robert Rubin, and became one of the more successful Democrat President since WWII. Clinton and Rubin left the U.S. economy in a superb fiscal position with surpluses as far as the eye can see. This is what was needed to get ready for the large fiscal costs of the upcoming Baby Boomers retirement.<br />On deregulation, Stiglitz argues that liberal Democrats conceded without putting up a fight. He decries Rubin's support for the successful campaign to repeal the Glass-Steagall Act, which separated commercial from investment banking. \\"I worried about the conflicts of interest, about the effect on competition,\\" he writes.<br />Stiglitz misses the point that U.S. banking regulation was becoming obsolete within an international framework. The U.S. banking system was the only one that had such strict separation between investment and commercial banking. Also, none of the Wall Street scandals were due to conflicts of interest between commercial and investment banking. They were due to conflict of interest between different groups within investment banking (business development and security analysis). Thus, on all counts, the Glass Steagall Act was an obsolete regulation.<br />Not that Stiglitz reserves all his criticism for fellow Democrats. He's even harder on the Bush family. \\"Looking at what preceded the Clinton Administration, and especially what followed it, the [Clinton] grades become almost glowing,\\" he writes. The title of his epilogue on President George W. Bush says it all: \\"Further Lessons on How to Mismanage the Economy.\\" On this count, Stiglitz is right on the money.<br />But, he should quit while he is ahead. Instead, Stiglitz also takes on Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan to task for inflating a bubble in the stock market. He says Greenspan should have raised margin requirements on loans to buy stocks. This is a petty criticism that is inconsequential when looking at Greenspan overall record. He has managed monetary policy proficiently, resulting in the U.S. economy experiencing a virtuous mix of low inflation, low unemployment, and strong economic growth. This is a record no other Western country matched. Greenspan job is to manage the economy, not to smooth out the ups and down of the stock market. Given his mission, Greenspan record is impeccable.<br />'The Roaring Nineties' doesn't live up to its subtitle as \\"a new history of the world's most prosperous decade.\\" There is no analysis about the cause of prosperity. He states: \\"Towards the end of the decade, what seemed to be the dawn of a new era began to look more like one of those short bursts of economic activity, or hyperactivity, inevitably followed by a bust, which had marked capitalism for two hundred years.\\" This quote would have made Karl Marx proud. Capitalism entails some risk (boom and bust cycles) by definition. But, it also generates greater wealth creation and individual opportunities than any other alternative. Stiglitz has a problem with that.<br />Stiglitz' cynical assessment of the 1990s doesn't square with the record. Around 1995, the U.S. economy made an abrupt change for the better, propelled by the effective use of information technology. After two decades of weakness, productivity began to surge way above its level in previous decades, and way past most of the U.S. international competitors.<br />Productivity continued to rise despite the bust, the 2001 recession, and the slow recovery that followed. Thus, the productivity boom was real, rather than just a side effect of a 1990s bubble. Stiglitz devotes only one paragraph (on page 321) to the role of technology in lifting productivity and the economy's sustainable growth rate. Because he devotes little attention to the sources of growth, this book winds up being little more than a catalog of Washington screwups. While Stiglitz argues that \\"the Roaring Nineties may not have been the fabulous decade that it appeared at the time,\\" he fails to support his argument.uare with the record.

Making a parallel with electricity, he notes that for decades, industrialists would electrify only parts of their plants, but only to supplement the older steam engines.  It wasn't until the 1920s (40 years after the discovery of electricity), when new immigration laws slowed the arrival of cheap labor, that U.S. industry plugged fully into the new electric technology and reaped the resulting prodcutivity gains.<br />Alcaly suggests that a similar lag is holding up the computer revolution. He argues that the full impact of the New Economy won't be felt until vast sectors upgrade their basic processes, transmitting data over the Internet between suppliers and customers.<br />In his broad survey of an economy in transition, Alcaly ranges from the equity markets to manufacturing and the Federal Reserve. He makes a solid case that a New Economy is upon us, even if its power is hard to measure and predict.	2003-11-01

Because he is isolated within a conservative administration, Powell has not been able to fulfill his potential.  On most issues, he is at the loosing end, while being usually right.<br />Dick Cheney, Vice President, is the most powerful Vice President, the U.S. ever had.  He is very intelligent, and domineering.  He is an harsh conservative.  He operates through confidential communication with the President that no one else is privy too.  As a result, his intent is almost impossible to overcome.<br />Donald Rumsfeld, Secretary of Defense, is the opposite of Powell.  He is loud, impatient, arrogant, and constantly overreaches on issues.  The gap between the State Department and the Defense Department has never been wider.  The Defense Department has preempted the State Department on foreign policies resulting in a radical shift to the right.  Rumsfeld is very intelligent and cunning.  This makes him a formidable nemesis for Powell.<br />The author is most critical of Bush.  He knows little about foreign affairs.  He is not intellectually curious.  He has less knowledge of history than most other presidents.  Regarding the Israel-Palestinian conflict, an official mentioned that \\"he does not have the knowledge or the patience to learn this issue enough to have an end destination in mind.\\"<br /><br />The Iraqi invasion was ill advised.  Iraq has little to do with terrorism.  Hussein and Islamic terrorist networks had diverging objectives.  Iraq did not possess weapons of mass destruction.  Between 1991 and 1998, UN inspectors destroyed Iraqis nukes.  But, the Administration became obsessed with regime change.  Yet, the Administration lacks the necessary planning, and commitment of time and money the regime change entails.  After WWII, the occupation of Japan lasted seven years, and Germany ten years.  These societies were far less fractious than Iraq.  It could take over 10 years to stabilize Iraq.  Lawrence Lindsay, Bush first Economic Advisor, stated the cost of the Iraqi regime change will be $100 to $200 billion.  After this statement, he was ousted.  His estimate may be too low.<br /><br />For the author, Iran represents the best hope of stabilizing the volatile Middle East.  Iran has its own history and natural borders (not fabricated by the West).  It has free election, and rising pro Western reformers.  The Bush administration should support Iran undergo its internal transformation.  Instead, he notes that Bush has made Iran a member of the \\"Axis of Evil.\\"  Bush frequent reference to this \\"Axis of Evil\\" has strengthened Iran hardliners.  Bush aggressive attitude towards Iran contributes to further destabilizing the region.  Rumsfeld is also bent on confronting Iran militarily.  Thus, relationship with Iran has fallen apart.  However, Iran is associated with serious policy issues that even a Democratic President could not ignore.  These include Irans ongoing nuclear program that is being supported directly by Russia.  Also, Iran supports financially several terrorist groups aiming their terror towards Israel.  These include the Palestinian Islamic Jihad, Hamas, and Hizbollah.<br />Pakistan is the most dangerous country; yet, it is an ally.  The author convincingly suggests that the Bush administration often has it wrong in selecting allies and foes.  The Pakistan India border is the most volatile region in the World.  Twice in the 12 months after 9/11, the two countries threatened to go to war.  Thisis a frightening thought considering the nuclear arsenal these countries have on both side of the Kashmir.  Despite General Musharraf stand against the Taliban and al-Qaeda, his army provides terrorist groups with training camps and weapons.  Two provinces are controlled by Taliban and al Qaeda sympathizers.  Pakistan madrassas schools are breeding grounds of Islamic terrorists.  Pakistan and North Korea have exchanged complimentary components of their respective nuclear technology.  Thus, Pakistan is a powder keg.  It should not be treated as an ally.<br />North Korea is a bankrupt country relying on foreign aid for its survival.  Russia has assisted its nuclear program development.  North Korea has sold nuclear technology to Iran and Pakistan. This is the only export it has.  Their nuclear program is advanced, as they have tested a missile with a range of over 1,000 miles that flew over Japan.  The government has attempted to negotiate a nonadversarial \\"Agreed Framework\\" with the U.S. for a decade.  Clinton had done great progress on this issue.  But, Bush interrupted all related negotiations.  And, his \\"Axis of Evil\\" speeches have halted any diplomatic development.  As a result, the North Koreans have developed their nuclear program more urgently.<br />In the authors view, the neo conservatives unilateral policies have destabilized the World Order.  The European Union is more fragmented and Anti-American.  Both the UN and NATO are ailing.  Actual attention to terrorism has suffered due to the obsession with regime change with the Axis of Evil states.  As expressed before, such foreign policies will do little in reducing terrorism.is a frightening thought considering the nuclear arsenal these countries have on both side of the Kashmir.

The two authors were staffers of the Clinton's National Security Council.  Yet, their analysis remains as objective as possible.<br />The book central argument is well accepted: the President unilateralism has produced quick victories in Afghanistan and Iraq but has fractured the world system and has exacerbated anti-Americanism.  As a result, the U.S. is less secure.  The authors make the case that \\"the fundamental premise of the Bush revolution that America's security rested on an America unbound was profoundly mistaken.\\"<br />The attacks of September 11, 2001, allowed Bush to refashion American foreign policy in a bolder fashion.  But, his vision and goals really had not changed.  His key assumption is the belief that states, rather than individuals or groups remain the essential force in international affairs.  Bush came up with his phrase \\"Axis of Evil\\" when referring to Iran, Iraq, and North Korea.  He also set his foreign policy in black or white \\"you are either with us or against us.\\"  This refers to countries supposedly supporting terrorism or not.  Despite the evidence that al Qaeda is supranational terrorist network with few allegiance to specific State, the Bush doctrine is to fight such terrorist network one State at a time.<br />While the connection between al Qaeda and the Afghanistan Taliban made sense following Bush vision that States do sponsor terrorism; The Taliban was the exception that confirms the rule.  Typically, it is not the case, as terrorist networks operate beyond State boundaries.  Yet, the conviction derived from victory over the Taliban sent Bush and the U.S. astray on an unbound foreign policy leading to the Iraqi invasion.<br />Regarding Iraq, all the administration assumptions turned out to be incorrect.  The U.S. administration three main assumptions where:<br />1) Saddam Hussein's possession of weapons of mass destruction posed an imminent threat;<br />2) Turning Iraq into a viable self-governing state would be easy.  The Iraqis would welcome U.S. troops as liberators; and<br />3) Once weapons were found and postwar normality returned even those countries opposed to the war would want to contribute to Iraq reconstruction.<br />All assumptions were wrong.  No weapons of mass destruction have been found.  The Iraqi society has collapsed.  U.S. soldiers are killed almost  daily by Islamic terrorists infiltrating Iraq.  And, the U.S. alone is bearing the fiscal and military burden of Iraq reconstruction.<br />Another false assumption driven by Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld was that the peacekeeping occupation of Iraq would take far fewer soldiers (only 30,000) than the actual war did.  This turned out to be a huge mistake.  It quickly became clear that the peacekeeping occupation required more soldiers than the war (180,000 for peacekeeping, only 125,000 for the war).  The soldiers ranks were quickly shored up; But, at a cost of more than $1 billion per week.  We will need that many troops there for at least another year or two.  This means $50 to $100 billion alone just for the U.S. troops.  This huge cost does not include any Iraq reconstruction cost.<br />Here is the true cost of Bush's unilateralism.  Militarily, close to half the U.S. Army is deployed in Iraq, with no exit date in sight.  American soldiers are on one-year rotations, and many face the prospect of returning to Iraq within a year of going home.  Morale, recruitment and retention are bound to suffer.  Our Army is being stretched too thinly on the wrong issue.  And, our ability to address more pressing national-security challenges is impaired.<br />The authors make sharp observation regarding the Administration vision.  Contrary to popular beliefs, they do not view Bush as a puppet manipulated by a neoconservatives.  Instead, they see Bush as an assertive leader effectively imposing his vision.  That he does not express it like a Ph.D. in political science is irrelevant.  The authors note that the top spots from an executive standpoint are not populated by neoconservatives (Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfovitz, Pentagon adviser Richard Perle), but instead by \\"assertive nationalists\\" such as Vice President Dick Cheney, and Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld.  But, the neoconservatives have successfully promoted their opinions.  Some of the assertive nationalists have become strong advocates of neoconservative policies.  This is particularly true for Dick Cheney.<br />Dick Cheney experienced a transformation after September 11, 2001.  He immersed himself in studying Islam and the Middle East, meeting with the top scholars on the subject: Bernard Lewis and Fouad Ajami.  These scholars argued that toppling Saddam would send a message of strength and enhance America's credibility throughout the Muslim world.  Having spent time with such tutors, the vice president became the chief advocate of the neoconservative position.  Thus, if one can argue with Dick Cheney's position on Iraq; surprisingly, one can't argue he had not consulted the top minds on the subject.  With 20/20 hindsight, it is easy to rebut the Administration Iraqi policies.  However, it is more challenging to navigate the quicksand of foreign policy.  Nevertheless, the book does an excellent job of clarifying one's hindsight on such matters.is irrelevant.

This is an excellent book on creative thinking.  It shows you how it does not take a rocket scientist to be a creative genius.  The authors demonstrate several creative thinking strategies that work very well.  They indicate that most great ideas come from two basic thinking strategies, including problems in search of solutions and solutions in search of problems.  The first strategy (problems in search of solutions) leads to the development of many new incremental products and services.  They are not so new in their concept, but they represent a different twist on existing concepts.  The second strategy (solutions in search of problems) leads to totally brand new technological and innovative breakthroughs.  Both strategies add tremendous value to our society, to commerce, and represents incremental hundred of $billion in national economic wealth.<br />The authors illustrate their creative concepts by many examples taken from the business world, and how corporations have introduced really innovative and successful products worldwide.  Examples include many creative financial services and product concepts.  So, if you work for a bank or a financial service company, you may find a lot of food for thoughts here.  But, examples are also taken from many different industries.  So, regardless of where you work, this book will have practical applications for you.<br />I work in a small think tank of one of the major financial institutions on the West Coast.  Parts of my yearly MBOs entail coming up with new financial product structures for my employer.  I was a bit in a creative thinking rut.  Just by reading this book, following the strategies suggested by the authors, I came up with a couple of very interesting product concepts that I cant wait to present to my management.  This book is really fun, and it will enhance both your creativity and your career.	2003-10-18

Greider gathers some good ideas, but also many very bad ones.  His good ideas include that the business sector is becoming more sensitive to environmental concerns.  He views being environmentally conscious at the corporate level as making excellent business sense.  He mentions the excellent work of Innovest which is the equivalent of a credit rating agency but covering environmental risk instead of credit risk.  Innovest gives environmental risk rating which look and smell just like credit ratings (AAA, AA, BBB, etc...) from Standard and Poors and Moody's.  He also praises the excellent returns and practices of all the socially responsible mutual funds.  Additionally, he shows much interest in the Wall Street Journal development of the Global Sustainability Index which tracks the 10% most environmentally and socially conscious publicly held corporations.  All the above concept are just great.  Mind you, he did not invent any of them, but he deserves some credit for uncovering them.  However, Greider in his morally driven enthusiasm goes way overboard.<br />Some of Greider's not so good concepts relate to governance.  In his mind, he feels that pension funds should essentially run the World.  They should certainly run Wall Street and tell them exactly what to invest in or not.  He indicated with much excitement how pension funds in certain cases have exerted their might and forced security analysts to revise their stand on a company stock because they expressed concerns on their rising labor cost due to its unionized force.  In another case, a pension fund forced an investment bank to retreat its support for the Bush Administration exploration of the privatization of social security.  I gather it is the right of pension funds to throw their weight around.  But, to go as far as thinking this is a really positive development leading to a more moral form of capitalism is a real stretch.  One thing for certain, is that such pressures rendering optimal pension investing impossible will certainly hurt the returns of these very same pension funds doing all the elbowing.  In turn, the pensioners will suffer.<br />Along the same lines, Greider thinks that labor unions should also regain their lost power.  He actually views labor unions and their respective large pension funds on the same power axis, and has nothing but praises for them.  I think some of the unions pension fund managers are extremely sharp.  I am thinking of CALPERS.  But, the majority of them are not so sharp.  I certainly don't think that the labor union and pension fund faction represents a broadbase solution for any of the problems that capitalism may or may not have.<br />Another area where Greider is disoriented is in plain economics.  He constantly stumbles on the trade off between equality and opportunity out of his good heart.  But, as a result he does not understand anything about the dismal science.  He states: &quot;An economic crunch seems unavoidable unless the distribution of income is altered significantly.&quot;  This is plain wrong.  There is no inverse correlation between economic growth and income distribution.  Sweden has a more equal distribution of income, but it's economic growth has actually paled compared to the U.S.  He goes on further stating: &quot;The house of economics is due for a major renovation if not complete tear down, because the economic order has lost one of its mainly emotional suppositions: the motivating fear of scarcity and deprivation.&quot;  That statement is ludicrous.  Individuals are motivated by maximizing their gains, and minimizing their risks.  They are not motivated by merely surviving above a dire scarcity threshold living standard, as he suggests.  I could go on an don.  The book is stuffed with economics misinterpretation.<br />In conclusion, this is a very mediocre book at best.  If you want to better understand the economics themes addressed by Greider, I recommend the books by Robert Reich.  One of his last book, The Future of Success, touches on many of the same economic themes.  Also, regarding the environmental business consciousness, I would dip into the very rich literature on sustainable development.  There are so many excellent books on this subject, some written 20 years ago, that are still a lot more innovative and accurate than Greider's book today.last book, The Future of Success, touches on many of the same economic themes.

He presents a smart rebuttal of the Bush administration policies.  His ideas will resonate with the U.S. electorate.  It will ensure our next President will be more of a Centrist.<br />Clark was against the war in Iraq.  This military venture has failed all intended political purposes.  We have not found a Iraqi nuclear program.  There are no links between Al Qaeda and Saddam Hussein.  The invasion of Iraq has not squelched terrorism, but instead exacerbated as thousands of terrorists throughout the Islamic World infiltrate Iraq and shoot U.S. soldiers as easy target.  Installing a lasting democracy seems unlikely.<br />The U.S. Administration post war planning was terrible.  The Administration made utopic assumptions that the Iraqis would be ecstatic about being liberated by U.S. forces.  The Administration underestimated the Baath party underground resistance, the degree of Shiite factionalism.  It also disbanded the Iraqi Army adding 400,000 armed men to the rank of the unemployed.  Many boosted the underground Baath party resistance.  In attempting to retain full control of the Iraq post war situation, the Administration raised its costs and risks.  This is instead of leveraging the UN and NATO peacekeeping forces.<br />Per Clark, terrorism is supranational with no State allegiance.  The Administration is attempting to fight it with an obsolete Cold War framework of State-vs-State conflicts.  It is attempting to fight terrorism as it fought back Nazism in WWII, and Communism thereafter.  The Administration has listed six other targeted countries for upcoming preemptive wars.  These include: Syria, Lebanon, Libya, Iran, Somalia, and Sudan.  This is a mistake that the U.S. can't afford.  Taking over these countries will do nothing to fight terrorism.<br />The U.S. is concerned about the wrong countries.  The root causes of Islamic terrorism are:<br />a) Saudi Arabia extreme Wahhabist ideology which dominates its schools;<br />b) the impoverished, corrupt society of Pakistan and its madrassas schools which teach an equally extreme version of Islam; and<br />c) the supercharged linkage with the Palestinians.<br />But, the U.S. considers Saudi Arabia and Pakistan their allies.  And, its Israeli bias further inflames the anti-Americanism throughout Islam.<br />For Clark the solution to fight terrorism is to boost intelligence agencies effectiveness worldwide. U.S.  funding should be redirected towards the CIA, FBI, and NSA.  Cooperation with European and other intelligence agencies should be implemented.  An international legal framework should be developed to reach uniform enforcement actions when dealing with terrorists worldwide.<br />Regarding Islam, Clark accepts that achieving transformation of the region is a generation away.  The concept that we can install democratic regimes that would take hold within these countries in  a few years is utopic.  These countries do not have an empowered informed middle class capable of  supporting lasting democracies.<br />Clark recommends that bringing the Islamic Middle East to converge towards the remainder of the World entails:<br />a) focusing on more pragmatic education (eliminate Wahhabism from school curriculum);<br />b) promote broader economic development; and<br />c) encourage wider political participation.<br />These measures are incremental and will take decades.  They can't be enforced militarily.<br />Regarding foreign policy, we have to end our unilateralism immediately.  This foreign policy has inflamed both Islam and the West.  It has threatened the viability of the UN and NATO.  Unilateralism should be replaced by multilateralism.  UN and NATO should be fully supported and lead by the U.S.  The UN Security Council unanimous rule should be changed.  It gives too much power to a single dissenting Security Council country member.  And, it does promote doing nothing in even the most egregious circumstances.  Clark understands that, and states it is up to the U.S. to lead in the amending of such policies so as to promote the effectiveness of multilateralistic supranational institutions.<br />Clark has a far reaching 100 year vision.  He wants the U.S. to maintain the best environment over the next 100 years.  To him the environment has several meanings.  It obviously means the physical environment.  The U.S. has to do more to protect the Air, Water, and natural resources.  He is also concerned about constitutional environment.  The U.S. should maintain an integer legal and judicial system.  It should also maintain a civic culture of transparency and accountability to set a world standard for governance.  He is also concerned about the business environment.  The U.S. should implement policies so as to encourage individuals and businesses to reap the fruit of their labor, innovation, and energy to the optimal level.  Obviously, these different environments have some diverging interests.  And, the key is to maintain an optimal balance between them, so that the U.S. society as a whole remains a leader and enviable model for the World in 2103 (hundred years from now).<br />Clark is concerned about fiscal responsibility.  The U.S. 10 year Budget has shifted from a $5 trillion Budget Surplus in 2001 to a $5 trillion budget Deficit in 2003.  This negative swing of $10 trillion was in part due to a global economic contraction after 2001.  But, it was in good part due to the Bush Administration policies that combined a reckless boost in Defense spending for fighting aboard combined with equally irresponsible series of fiscally damaging tax cuts.<br />Clark economic plan follows pretty much the beneficial aspects of Clintonomics.

And, as we'll see there are many, and there are serious.  Starting with economics ones, since 1990, the Japanese economy has literally stopped growing.  Ever since, it has experienced deflation associated with lackluster consumer demand.  Its unemployment rate has steadily risen from 2% in 1991 to 3.5% in 2001, and is expected to continue rising to unprecedented levels relative to historical levels.  The banking system is in disarray, piling up nonperforming loans (NPLs) faster than the system can charge them off.  The lack of integer accounting and adequate disclosure makes it impossible to have a firm handle on the overall levels of these NPLs.  Government figures of $250 billion in NPLs grossly underestimate this issue.  More realistic figures from the private sectors are around $1 trillion.  The Japanese government has made no progress whatsoever in solving the NPL problem since it first surfaced in 1989.  To stimulate the economy, the government has turned to a huge boost in public spending on large public sector infrastructure projects.  But, these projects have been totally unproductive like highways going to nowhere.  As a result, Japan's public debt level has rapidly risen to unsustainable levels.  Japan's public debt recently exceeded 140% of its GDP.  For comparison, U.S. government debt at its peak stood at 60% of GDP.  Japan's debt has risen to 27% of all government debt worldwide, from only 17% in 1992.<br />By almost any measure, China is a growing economic rival to Japan, and it's winning.  By one estimate of purchasing power parity, China's GDP outstripped Japan's, $5 trillion to $3.4 trillion in 2001.  Given their respective growth rates (China very fast, Japan flat), China is expected to further leave Japan in the dust in terms of economic growth and might.<br />Japan also faces a demographic juggernaut.  With a rapidly rising aging population and a shrinking workforce, you have fewer workers supporting an increasing retiree population.  Pension benefits are financed by income tax, but the share of the tax needed to cover existing benefits would have to rise from 12% to 38% in 20 years, something that Japanese citizens simply do not expect to happen.<br />Japan's political system is dominated by a single party, the Liberal Democratic Party who has been in power since the end of WWII.  The lack of political competition between at least two viable competing parties has rendered Japan's political system lethargic, and unable to implement the type of reforms necessary to resolve its economic problems.  The political system is characterized by little innovation, seemingly endemic corruption, and weak leadership:  Japan has had 11 prime ministers since 1987.  None of them left much of a legacy on the system.<br />The authors offer several solutions to Japan's multi dimensional problems.  These include:<br />1)Rendering their markets more open to both foreign and domestic competition.  Create a business climate through taxation that stimulates entrepreneurship and risk taking;<br />2)Bring more women in the workforce.  And, encourage a greater equality between women and men in business, politics, and society at large;<br />3)Be more open to foreign inmigration which has been so far very close to zero; and<br />4)Open up the domestic economy to an influx of direct foreign investment.<br />On this last point, the recent Renault acquisition of Nissan was a good start.  But, far more major foreign acquisitions need to take place to reform domestic business practices.  Foreign companies have proven to be far better employers of women and the young.  Thus, foreign companies are healthy agents of change within Japanese society.  However, so far they are still playing only a minor role in terms of the overall employment in Japan.<br />As seen above, this policy book is really short on solutions.  The proposals mentioned above make good sense, but they have been reiterated for at least 10 years by policy analysts with little impact on the direction Japan is going.<br />Also, many problems remain unaddressed by this policy groups, including how to resolve the NPL problem, how to restructure not only the banking system, but the entire capital markets in Japan.  Despite the Big Bang reform of 1995, the Japanese capital markets remain inefficient and far behind their counterparts in the U.S. and the U.K.  How to shore up Japan's fiscal position.  This includes reducing its structural budget deficits that currently run at 6% to 7% of GDP.  It also entails paying down government debt that have reached staggering levels.  How to seriously resolve its demographic challenges is another serious issue.  Just saying that Japan has to be more open to foreign inmigration is to be ignorant of the xenophobic Japanese culture.<br />One of the authors of this book, Paul Crane Dorfman, stated a rebuttal at the end of this study.  He indicated that the solutions as proposed (opening up markets, greater role of women, better business climate for entrepreneurship) are not at all probable to be achieved to any material degree.  He adds that the overall optimistic tone of the book that Japan can actually come back to be a preeminent and healthily growing economic power is unjustified.  After reading this book, I fully agree with his judgment.

This includes reducing its structural budget deficits that currently run at 6% to 7% of GDP.  It also entails paying down government debt that have reached staggering levels.  How to seriously resolve its demographic challenges is another serious issue.  Just saying that Japan has to be more open to foreign inmigration is to be ignorant of the xenophobic Japanese culture.<br />One of the authors of this book, Paul Crane Dorfman, stated a rebuttal at the end of this study.  He indicated that the solutions as proposed (opening up markets, greater role of women, better business climate for entrepreneurship) are not at all probable to be achieved to any material degree.  He adds that the overall optimistic tone of the book that Japan can actually come back to be a preeminent and healthily growing economic power is unjustified.  After reading this book, I fully agree with his judgment.  Just like him, I hope we are both wrong.	2003-10-01

But, utopic solutions	This is another rebuttal of Bush foreign policy.  And, Barber is an excellent critic.  According to Barber, unilateralism is out, preemptive wars are self defeating and dangerous, and the focus on preempting nuclear capabilities of rogue nations is futile.  In other words, the whole war on terrorism is a costly and dangerous escapade that will not reduce terrorism, but instead exacerbate it.  Barber's opinion is very popular right now, and overall dominates the media, especially the European one.<br />Barber was strongly opposed to both the invasion of Afghanistan and Iraq.  He states that the only reason we invaded these countries was to fight terrorism.  Again, Barber has the polls on his side, as his views on this topic are really conventional.  However, Thomas Friedman, Robert Lewis, and other luminaries say this is a gross oversimplification.<br />Both countries (Iraq, Afghanistan) were governed by totalitarian inept governments that were quickly destroying the economic base of their respective countries.  Also, lack of adequate social policies promoted rampant demographic growth in both countries.  With a rapidly shrinking economic pie, and rising population, the GDP per capita plunged to desperate levels.  Meanwhile, both countries practiced the politics of deflection.  Instead of addressing any of their domestic problems with intelligent domestic policies, they blamed all their ills on the Great Satan, the U.S.  This message was further brainwashed in the head of youth through a collapsing educational system.  With a growing and frustrated youth population without employment prospects, the ranks of terrorists swelled rapidly throughout the region.  So, there are many very good reasons why we have triggered regime changes in these countries.  This is in addition to the well known human rights and women's rights issues that were tragic in both countries.  Obviously, you will not learn any of the above within Fear's Empire.  This is because it effectively contradicts Barber theories.<br />Barber also makes an interesting case that democracy always fails when it is imposed from the outside.  Again, he has the polls on his side as most people believe that.  But, a study of history suggests it is not true.  Three cases in point include Japan, Germany, and South Korea.  All three countries would not be democracies today if it was not the result of external forces.<br />Barber is not as good a strategist, as he is a critic (of Bush foreign policy).  In other words, his solutions to the foreign policy challenges in a post 9/11 world are much less impressive.  His solutions rely on cosmetic dialectic jargon with vague historical references absent of any substance.  For instance, Pax Americana reflects Bush foreign policy enforced through unilateral military power in a similar way as the Romans did two millennia ago (Pax Romana).  Instead, he suggests Lex Humana which promotes a multilateral approach which entails the U.S. giving up a significant amount of sovereignty and power to supranational institutions.  However, a study of history suggests that the nation who has the power does not relinquish it readily.  Also, he would replace preventive wars with preventive democracy.  Preventive democracy consists in supporting the advent of democracy worldwide through soft power means including education.<br />Barber says that the terrorists are so much better at using education as a weapon than we are.  He mentions the Wahhabi schools in Saudi Arabia and Pakistan that teaches an extremist version of Islam which include an unconditional hatred of the U.S.  What Barber does not explain, is how we could peacefully practice \\"preventive democracy\\" and change all the history textbooks in Mosques schools throughout the Middle East to promote a more factual and balanced historical view of the West, and the U.S. in particular.<br />Most of other Barber recommendations are typically equally utopic.  He forgets that we have tried the \\"preventivedemocracy\\" route, supported by hundreds of $millions in foreign aid, in our dealings with the Middle East since the fall of the Ottoman Empire.  And, we don't have much success to show for it.  The level of civil unrest, political corruption, Islamic insurrection throughout the region is such that democracy never took root.  Barber's recommendation assumes that all of a sudden Middle Eastern governments would recognize on their own the merit of democracy (which typically runs against the ruling government self interest) and so would terrorists.<br />In terms of foreign policy, it is a lot easier to criticize that whatever the White House Administration is doing is wrong, than to come up with a viable alternative.

This book is really entertaining and informative about the tennis world.  Interviews with tennis current tennis stars and the ones of yesteryears are fascinating.  You see the contrasting personalities and tennis styles of Borg, Connors, McEnroe, Gerulaitis, Sampras.<br />The reviews of the best matches in history can give you shivers down your spine.  I am old enough to have seen many of them.  And, the book makes you relive some fabulous tennis moments such as the 16-14 tiebreaker in the 4th set that McEnroe, as the underdog, won against Borg in a Wimbledon final.  Borg regrouped and won his 5th Wimbledon title anyway.  But, David (McEnroe) so to speak had the sling shot to beat Goliath (Borg) and the rest is history.  McEnroe went on in his early career by successfully dismantling Borg's game stroke per stroke, and sent the Swede into early retirement (at 25) and a long mental depression.<br />If you love the game, you'll love this book.<br />I bought a copy of this book, and lent it to one of my tennis pal.

Putting aside much biasness, Krugman makes some interesting points.  Most of what he writes is accurate.  But, he tells you the truth, not the whole truth.<br />On fiscal topics, Krugman is on strong ground.  His main theme is that republican administrations for decades have worked at chipping away at the great government programs created by democrats, including Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid.  His fiscal and tax analysis goes back to Reagan first term in the early eighties, and as can be expected, has a real field day with Bush Jr.  His analysis concludes always the same thing.  The Republican tax cuts always benefited the very rich, had very little impact on the middle class, and did not help out the poor that much.<br />On the economy, Krugman questions the beneficial impact of these tax cuts.  Here Krugman takes an interesting tack.  He is a Keynesian, and believes government spending or tax reductions are indeed expansionary and can benefit a struggling economy.  What he argues with is the Supply Side miracle.  He believes in plain arithmetic.  You reduce tax rates, you get fewer tax dollars, and not the opposite as Supply Siders maintains.  Krugman is right.<br />Krugman attacks on Reagan and Bush Jr. is not only that they cut taxes, but that in his views, they both lied to the American public and misrepresented the impact of their respective tax cuts.  They both used the Supply Side miracle analogy not out of economic naivet&eacute;, but as a manipulative ploy.  Both Presidents used the same creative arithmetic.  We cut taxes, we augment defense spending, and over time the Budget deficit will decline thanks to huge pick up in economic growth.  As we know, this fiscal postulate does not work that well.  During the Reagan years, the economy actually fared very well, but the Budget Deficits continued rising rapidly.  In a sense, the exact same thing is happening currently.  Bush cut taxes three years in a row, the U.S. economy has been the locomotive of the whole World during this worldwide economic contraction, but now we have a large structural deficit, that won't just evaporate.  To the contrary, our fragile fiscal house is going to incur a tidal wave of fiscal costs associated with the retirement of the baby boomers starting in 2010.<br />So what is the whole truth that Krugman is not telling you about.  Well Krugman runs into issues of ideological framework.  The first one is his obsession about the unfairness of Republican tax cuts.  The truth is that in a very progressive income tax system such as in the U.S., the rich pay the majority of taxes and incur by far the highest effective tax rates, the middle class does not pay a whole lot, and the poor actually do not pay any taxes, they actually receive tax credits.  So, just about any tax cut will benefit the rich more than other classes, because that is who pays the taxes.  Is that so unfair?  Krugman really thinks so.<br />The other issue is his criticism that American society would be so much better off if Americans paid a lot more taxes.  He mentions that in the U.S. taxes represent only 26.3% of GDP, which is so much lower than in Canada (38.2%), France (45.8%), and Sweden (52.2%).<br />However, all these countries with such a higher tax burden have performed so much poorly than the U.S. for decades.  You can look at any metrics, including: GDP growth, GDP growth per capita, job creation, technological innovation, unemployment rate, labor productivity, rising living standards, capital formation.  And on all counts, the U.S. has routinely outperformed all of them.  Also, you would think that these higher taxing countries would be better prepared to face the tidal wave of fiscal costs associated with the retirement of the baby boomers.  But, on the contrary, their respective situation is more severe than in the U.S. because of demographic factors (lower fertility rates and inmigration rates than in theU.S.).  So, would American society be so much better off with a European level of taxation.  Economic historical evidence suggests it would clearly not be.<br />As reviewed, there is a whole lot missing from Krugman analysis.  He is calling Reagan and Bush Jr. liars and manipulators.  But, by deeds of omission, he has committed the exact same sins.n the U.S.).  So, would American society be so much better off with a European level of taxation.

US	52977415	R106609B8TCEYM	0892063912	814161942	The Fiscal Challenge of an Aging Industrial World (Csis Significant Issues Series)	Books	5	6	6	N	Y	Excellent study on the subject	Robert England has written several books on the impact of global aging.  This is an excellent study on this huge macroeconomic factor that is not resolved by any of the G-7 countries.<br />Robert England makes a convincing case that all governments from the G-7 group have greatly understated the fiscal pressures that the demographics of aging will impose on their respective government finances over the next 50 years.  He contrasts the official figures on this subject with output from the demographic model developed by the Mountain View Research (MVR).  In each cases, official estimates way understate demographic pressures of a growing aging population and the associated fiscal costs of supporting government programs earmarked for the elderly.<br />While governments predict that by 2050, life expectancy at birth will be 80.5 years in the U.S. and 83.0 years in Japan.  The private sector MVR forecasts that the median outcome will be 83.2 years in the U.S. and 91.9 years in Japan.  Thus, government authorities may have understated life expectancies by 2050 by 2.7 years in the U.S. and by 8.7 years in Japan.  These years represent understated longevity gains of 17.9% in years over 65 for the U.S., and an amazing 50% for Japan.  This is a serious matter because the addition of 50% more years after age 65 is roughly equivalent to another 50% increase in the cost of providing pensions, medical, and nursing care to elderly people than previously thought.<br />In my current job, I develop models catered to the financial service industry that are similar to the demographic MVR model.  Using a regression analysis model, I was able to exactly replicate MVR median U.S. life expectancy by 2010, 2030, and 2050.  My own judgment is that the MVR median figures are slightly overstated.  This is because the underlying MVR assumption is that the increase in U.S. life expectancy experienced over the past 20 years, will continue forward at the same pace unabated over the next 50 years.  I don't think this is realistic for a median outcome.  But, using my same model, and progressively slowing the increase in life expectancy from one decade to the next, I come to the conclusion that the MVR estimates seem much closer to what appears realistic than official figures.  In other words, even slowing down dramatically future increase in life expectancy, I come up with figures that are much higher than the official ones, and that are closer to the MVR ones.  This smacks of governments manipulating their own analysis to understate the fiscal costs of global aging.<br />The  G-7 countries have greatly underestimated the impact of all other demographic assumptions.  Relative to the private sector MVR figures, they underestimated the rise in old age dependency ratios.  Officials have done this by overstating fertility rates, inmigration rates, labor force participation.  As a result, they have overstated the population of the labor force supporting the elderly population (that they have understated as mentioned in the prior paragraph).  Thus, while officials predict that by 2050 the old-age dependency ratio will rise to 0.371 in the U.S., MVR median outcome is 0.393 (this means there will be 39 retirees supported by 100 workers; or there will be only 2.5 workers supporting each retiree).  In Japan, the difference is more dramatic.  Officials forecast the old-age dependency ratio will reach 0.592 while MVR median outcome is 0.734 (only 1.36 active worker supporting each retiree).  These differences have drastic impact on the respective government debt levels these countries will have to issue to support government programs aimed at the elderly.<br />Robert England mentions that there is no one solution that will allow governments finances to withstand this demographic tidal wave.  What is needed is an all out effort on all fronts including: a) a reduction in elderly benefits (especially in Europe where they are way too high to be sustainable); b) a progressive rise in the retirement age which reflects rising life expectancies; and c) government policies to support rising fertility rate and increase inmigration (this is a huge issue in Japan).<br />Robert England details the experience of Germany and Italy at attempting fiscal reforms (reducing pensions, increasing retirement ages) to address these upcoming fiscal issues associated with the rapid aging of their respective population. Apparently, implementing reforms that will adequately manage these future fiscal costs represent a formidable political challenge.

It reviews fundamental analysis, technical analysis, option theory and many other topics. The author explains exceptionally well the Efficient Market Hypothesis and the debate surrounding it. He also introduces basic concepts of behavioral finance.<br />Abstract.<br />As a mathematician having studied the stock market, he believes the stock market is pretty efficient; and that both technical analysis and fundamental analysis do not have much predictive value.<br />Technical analysis according to him should be renamed trend analysis, as it consists in graphing and extrapolating current stock price trends. He covers the major strategies technical analysts use such as buying stocks when their current price breaks through its moving average, and selling them when they fall under this same moving average.<br />He covers fundamental analysis and their associated metrics in good details. Reading this section, you will become familiar with all the usual metrics, including P/E, PEG, P/Book value, P/Sales.<br />Mr. Paulos makes a case that the stock market captures the aggregate of all our psychological foibles, and goes on giving a good introduction in behavioral finance. He illustrates the common psychological flaws associated with investor behavior, including: the confirmation bias, anchoring effect, status quo bias, endowment effect, and Richard Thaler's mental accounts. He also illustrates flaws we incur when doing investment research, such as: data mining back testing, and the survivor bias. But, in aggregate these human errors partly cancel themselves out rendering the stock market pretty efficient.<br />The book's gem is the debate on the Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH). The fewer the investors believe in EMH, the more they will engage in technical and fundamental analysis to extract excess return above the index. These &quot;active&quot; investors will render the market increasingly efficient, and negate their opportunities to earn excess return. The opposite is also true. If investors believe in EMH, they will become &quot;passive&quot; and just buy the stock index through a Vanguard fund or an ETF. As a result, the market will not be so efficient, and the EMH will not hold up in such a situation. So if you believe in EMH, it is false. But, if you don't believe in it, it is valid.<br />Paulos argues that enough active investors do not believe in the EMH to render it valid. This argument is convincing when you think of the thousands of mutual funds, hedge funds, and private managers on Wall Street. Thus, there are plenty of professional active investors to render the market very efficient. But, Paulos does not deny that certain markets at certain times, temporarily ignored by Wall Street, may be less than efficient. Thus, for him the EMH debate is not just a true or false question, it is a matter of degree.<br />Active investors play a crucial role in making the market efficient. Paulos makes an interesting distinction between the technical analyst and fundamental analyst. He states that technical analysts are momentum investors. Thus, they cause market volatility to increase. When stock prices increase, these guys buy even more. When stock prices decrease, they sell. Thus, they accentuate the swings in stock movements. Notice that they break the rule of Buy Low Sell High. The fundamental analysts are really value investors or contrarians. They do just the opposite of the technical analysts, and cause stock price movements to moderate. Thus, the two types of analysts/investors play a different role. But, together their active analysis make the stock market very efficient. The EMH states that all information is disseminated and absorbed immediately within the investment community, and thus is fully reflected within stock prices. But, somebody has to process this information. And, that is what the technical and fundamental analysts do.<br />One of Paulos other big concept concernsthe statistical distribution of stock price movements. According to the EMH, stock price movements are random. And, this is true as confirmed by the autocorrelation on any time series of stock prices that is typically very close to zero. If stock prices move randomly, they should assume a normal distribution. But, Paulos indicates it is not always the case. In other words, extreme events (stock crashes or booms) happen more frequently than in a normal distribution. He adds that at the tails, the price movement of stocks is better captured by the power laws. Check page 178 for a detailed explanation on power laws. This is fascinating, and it may represent an upgrade to the EMH that relies solely on the normal distribution.erns the statistical distribution of stock price movements.

Well apparently it is all true.  Given the author in depth research and documentation, this story appears credible enough to become part of history.  This is an incredibly interesting book for both its shock value and historical documentation.<br />The book main two themes are:<br />a) that a U.S. foreign policy in the eighties aimed at fighting back the Soviets in Afghanistan resulted in the acceleration of the formation of Muslim terrorist networks such as al-Qaida; and<br />b) that in the nineties, the U.S. supported the advent of the Taliban in the hope of stabilizing the Afghan government.  This was to facilitate the building of a Trans-Afghan pipeline to be developed by U.S. oil companies.<br />As part of a Cold War strategy, since 1979 and onward, the U.S. provided support and trained Muslim warriors who built up a resistance to the Soviet-backed Afghanistan government.  The Soviets soon decided to invade Afghanistan to crush this Muslim resistance movement and control the U.S. rising influence in the region.  At this stage, the U.S. renewed their efforts and enlisted, trained, and funded more and more warriors or moujahidin.  The CIA turned to many Muslim charities and religious groups around the World and the U.S. for recruiting.  Pretty soon the funding and arm supplies came not only from the U.S., but also from Saudi Arabia, Pakistan and other countries.  At the same time, Osama bin Laden also found his way in Afghanistan and joined the fight against the Russian.  Osama success in fighting the Soviets, gave him the leadership and momentum to build his budding organization al-Qaida.<br />After the retreat of the Soviets during the early nineties, Osama bin Laden, Pakistan, and the U.S. all favored the advent of the Taliban in Afghanistan.  For the U.S. and Pakistan, the idea was to create an independent, strong, and stable Pushtun state in Afghanistan.  In turn, this reliable Afghan government could provide the stability needed to allow U.S. oil companies to complete their plans for a trans Afghan pipeline that would deliver oil from Central Asia to Pakistani ports on the Indian Ocean.  For Osama bin Laden, the Taliban created an alliance and a haven for his terrorist network al Qaida, since bin Laden had lost his Saudi Arabian citizenship.  This was because he supported Saudi opposition groups against the royal family.  He did that because of the Saudi government letting U.S. military forces in Saudi Arabia in the 1990 Gulf War.<br />Also, after the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan, many Muslim moujahidin joined al Qaida and other terrorist networks.  As a result, Osama and his colleagues started exporting terrorism literally Worldwide and causing havoc in Africa, Pakistan, India, Indonesia, Chechnya and many other places.  Ever since terrorism has escalated in violence, ruthlessness (killing increasingly civilians, tourists), and capability (both from a weapon and strategic standpoint).<br />With 20/20 hindsight, one can only wonder what would have happen if the U.S. had never gotten involved in the affairs of the Afghan Soviet supported government in the late seventies and eighties.  Would al-Qaida ever got off the ground?  Would the clash of civilization between the U.S. and Islam be as intense?  Would the 9/11 events never have occurred? Would the Cold War be over?  And, would the Soviet Union still exist?  This book will definitely make you think.the U.S. and Pakistan, the idea was to create an independent, strong, and stable Pushtun state in Afghanistan.

He conducted detailed economics and historical research, and uncovered that just about everything about tulipmania as described in Charles Mackay book \\"Extraordinary popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds\\" is either inaccurate, or exaggerated.  The Dutch never mortgaged their entire properties for a single bulb.  Also, Holland did not suffer a depression after the tulip market crashed.  According to the author, very little net wealth was actually wiped out.  Instead, the price of rare tulips was driven by rational economic considerations reflecting the short supply and the rising demand for this rare tulip bulb type.  The price of these tulip bulbs at anyone time reflected expected investment returns from investors.  Other economists have also documented that the price of tulip bulbs did go back up to similar level several centuries later associated with favorable economics change in this market.<br />The author goes on to further explain the rational economics fundamentals behind the Mississippi Bubble of 1719-1720 resulting from an attempt to swap French government debt for equity in a private company, financed by printing paper money.  He similarly explains out in similar economics terms the South Sea Bubble of 1720 which was the equivalent of a leveraged buyout of the national debt of Great Britain.  Both investment schemes ultimately collapsed, but their respective economics and strong government support at the onset gave these investment propositions very strong fundamentals.  These investments are not so different than investments today in GSEs like Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae, and Sallie Mae.  Because of accounting irregularities, the stocks in these GSEs have recently taken a beating.  But, there is no ground for talking about a GSE stock bubble.<br />The author has strong credentials to support his iconoclastic thesis that is not that well known by the economics establishment.  He is a global strategist at Global Markets Research at Deutsche Bank and Professor of Economics at Brown University.<br />The Internet bubble has often been compared to the three investment bubbles mentioned above.

The first book is essentially how to get along in Arabic countries.  The second book is on geopolitics.<br />When the author writes about Arabic social customs and misunderstanding between Arabs and Westerners, she is more often than not right on the mark.  The two populations are obviously very different in their overall behavior and approach to many aspects of life.  In a sense it is an extrapolation of the North/South behavioral axis you find in many countries.  If you meet a Northern French or Italian, he typically will be more reserved, more serious, and somewhat introverted than his Southern counterpart who will be more joyful, louder, extrovert.  The North/South behavioral axis is not so pronounced in the U.S., as it is in many European countries.  In any case, take this North/South axis and compound it several times, and you get an idea of the gulf between the typical Western behavior and the Arabic one.  The author does an excellent job at explaining the differences between these two cultures.  And, the information she imparts on this subject is truly useful for anyone traveling, working, or living in Arabic countries.<br />When the author shares her opinion about geopolitics, she is on quick sand.  Her views on this subject are full of fallacies, contradictions, and errors.  The author has no credentials and knowledge to support any of her subjective opinions.  After all, her academic background is as an Arabic teacher.  She has no academic degree in political science, international economics, demographics, or any other relevant discipline.  And, it really shows.

He is the founder of a hedge fund research firm that tracks over 2,500 hedge funds and has developed several hedge fund indexes.  The language and mathematics within the book are crystal clear.  Overall, this book gives you an excellent technical foundation in market neutral investing.<br />As Nicholas describes, the market neutral strategy encompasses eight different substrategies that deal with financial instruments ranging from equities, to convertible bonds, and mortgage backed securities.  Nicholas dedicates a whole chapter for each substrategy.  Within each chapter, he describes how a specific strategy structures its market neutral positions, how it earns its return, and what risks it bears.<br />Nicholas explains clearly that market neutral investing derives its return not from market movements, but from changes in the relationship or spread between its long positions and its short positions within a certain type of securities.<br />Market neutral investing consists in observing relationships between similar securities; and taking a long position in the ones that appear underpriced while taking a short position in similar securities that appear overpriced.  This strategy is called convergence.  The investor bets that the spread between the values of securities he is long and the one he is short will narrow.  This entails that in relative term, the long positions are expected to appreciate and the short position are expected to depreciate.  Thus, the values of the long undervalued positions and the values of the short overvalued positions should converge over time.  That would be ideal.  It does not always work out that way.  Often, the long and short positions respective values do not converge, but diverge.  That is what killed Long Term Capital Management.<br />The one caveat is that this book comes across as a commercial for market neutral investing.  Nicholas convinces you will earn superior risk adjusted returns vs. regular investing strategies.  Also, you will benefit from the market neutral strategies being uncorrelated to traditional stocks and bonds markets.  Thus, market neutral strategies provide you with diversification benefits.<br />Regarding diversification benefits, Nicholas is correct.  Given that these strategies returns are somewhat independent from market movements in the related securities, it makes sense that they would be uncorrelated to these same markets.<br />Nicholas assertion that these strategies provide superior risk adjusted return is less convincing.  I would not be surprised his data is victim of survivor bias.  If you select only the funds that survived during your research period, you ignore all the funds that failed during this same period.  As a result, you overstate the performance of this investment style by selecting only the strong survivors.  Additionally, his time horizon is too short.  On page 7, he graphs the risk vs. returns for different market neutral strategies during the nineties alone.  That is not long enough.  Granted some of these strategies did not exist for much longer.  Thus, we can't tell yet if performance is for real.  Also, he states that all these strategies are above the efficient frontier that represents a straight line between the T-Bill risk/return position and the S&amp;P 500 risk/return position.  But, the efficient frontier is not on a straight line, but rather on a concave line.  If the efficient frontier was graphed correctly, many of the market neutral strategies would be under the efficient frontier.<br />I am skeptical about the superior risk adjusted return of market neutral strategies because of my own experience.  We invested in three such market neutral funds.  They had alluring past performance that confirmed everything Nicholas says about such funds.  The minute we invested in such funds, their performance mysteriously deteriorated.  Somehow,all these funds benefited from convergence before we invested.  But, suffered from divergence right after we invested.  Within two years, we closed out our investment positions in all three funds, and never regretted it.  Thus, I feel that data integrity, and disclosure are real issues in this industry.  And, it undermines the credibility of their superior past performance.<br />My reservation regarding market neutral investing are supported by well publicized failures of some of the biggest funds within this investment style.  These include the failure of Long Term Capital Management and the liquidation of the Tiger Funds.<br />If you want to track how a market neutral fund performs, you can follow one of the oldest AXA Barra market neutral fund (SSMNX).  As you will see, the performance is lackluster.  And, I believe it is representative of the performance of this sector.<br />Besides my reservation regarding market neutral investing, this book gives you an excellent foundation on this subject.ated.

The article suggested that the bible of econ textbook had been so far the one written by Paul Samuelson.  But, The Economist book review made an excellent case that Mankiw textbook should become the prevailing introduction to economics textbook.  Why is that?  Well, Mankiw book covers all the subject and the technicalities Samuelson textbook covers.  Additionally, Mankiw book is hip, current, entertaining, and fun to read.  His economic examples are full of pop stars, movie stars, sports heroes, and other mass media public figure we all know off.  He brings in as supportive educational material many columns from the Wall Street Journal, or New York Times written by famous economists such as Paul Krugman, and Lester Thurow among others.<br />A day after reading The Economist book review I bought the book.  I read and studied it with so much pleasure over the next two months that I felt I was back in some of the best classes I had ever taken in undergrad and grad school.  Today, as part of my work as an internal financial consultant for a major U.S. bank, I often do research projects regarding fairly esoteric economics issues.  And, I often review and study specific chapters of this book to refresh my economics foundation.  I gather by now you can tell I love this book.  Anyone who has an interest in economics should acquire this book first as educational enjoyment, and second as an invaluable reference.	2003-09-03
US	52977415	R2IN6J2O97VKQV	0393058549	20116327	The Random Walk Guide to Investing: Ten Rules for Financial Success	Books	5	305	312	N	N	This is the best investment guide I have read yet.	Burton Malkiel is the author of the incredibly successful investment theory book \\"A Random Walk Down Wall Street\\" first published in 1973.  Thirty years later, his publisher suggested he writes an investment guide capturing the wisdom from \\"A Random Walk\\" in a shorter tome aimed at the layperson.  Malkiel did exactly that.  In this book, he does a beautiful job in avoiding statistics out of reach for the layperson.  Yet the investment advice remains sharp and relevant.<br />Malkiel covers a lot of ground in investments, financial planning, retirement, savings for college, and insurance in just 180 pages.  He structures this knowledge through just ten basic rules.  Throughout, he includes numerous useful tools.  One is the famous rule of 72.  If you divide 72 by the investment return, it will tell you how many years it takes to double your investment.  Thus, Malkiel covers all the basics and also explores the cutting edge of behavioral economics from the luminaries in this field including Robert Shiller (Irrational Exuberance) and Richard Thaler.  This book is just as interesting to the layperson and the investment professional alike.<br /><br />Malkiel advice can be summarized as follows.  Save regularly through 401Ks and other means.  Invest in low cost mutual funds and index funds across four asset classes (money market funds, bonds, stocks, and REITs).  Invest according to your optimal asset allocation which reflects your time horizon (driven by your age), your financial capacity to absorb losses, and your risk tolerance.  Take full advantage of tax advantage investments, including 401Ks, IRAs, Education Savings Accounts.  The book includes many more fascinating aspects of investing.<br />Malkiel outlines eloquently the benefits of index funds.  They incur lower operating costs.  They have lower turnover, which leads to lower transaction costs and greater tax efficiency.  Consequently, index funds beat actively managed funds by 2 percentage points.  Malkiel states this superior performance is a direct result of index funds low cost advantage.  The higher cost handicap of actively managed funds is insurmountable over time.  As a result, the S&P 500 index beats out 84% of large cap mutual funds over 10 years, and 88% over 20 years.<br />This leads to one of Malkiel most surprising point.  Two investors investing $1,000 in an IRA earning respective returns of 6% and 8%; the investor earning 8% will have more than twice as much money in his account after 40 years ($21,725 vs. $10,286).  I thought Malkiel made a typo.  I calculated the figures, and he did not.  This has huge implication in a long term investment environment where single digit returns will become the norm.  Costs matter a lot!<br />On diversification Malkiel includes much original intelligence.  He makes a strong case that international diversification is not all what it is cracked up to be.  This is because international stock markets move increasingly together when the U.S. one experiences a downturn.  Also, he mentions that REITs provide excellent diversification benefits (better than international stocks).  I have personally done much research on this subject, using regression analysis.  And, Malkiel is correct, even though this fact is unknown to Wall Street.<br />Malkiel recommends different asset allocations for different age brackets (Life-Cycle investing).  He tracks how these different asset allocations performed over the past 20 years (January 1983 to December 2002).  It is stunning to note that the most aggressive asset allocation targeted to young people with a 65% stock exposure would have earned a 11.52% return or only one percentage point greater than the most conservative one targeted at senior citizens with only 25% stock exposure which earned a 10.51% return.  On the other hand, the most aggressive asset allocation would have suffered 20 quarterly losses with the worst one being minus 14.5%; meanwhile the most conservative asset allocation would have incurred only 16 quarterly losses with the worst one being only minus 5.0%.  This gives you pause on how much additional risk is it worth taking.<br />Malkiel does also a credible job of explaining the superior long term performance of Warren Buffet and Peter Lynch despite the efficiency of the markets and the overall superiority of index funds.  Of the two, he states that Peter Lynch record is much less impressive.<br />He attributes much of Lynch record to the laws of randomness.  If you have a 1,000 coin flippers and you make them flip a coin 10 times in a row, you will have one coin flipper who will have flipped tails 10 times in a row.  He will be perceived as a genius.  But, he was just lucky.  Observing Peter Lynch record, his hand got progressively colder as his Magellan fund became larger and his tenure lengthened.  This is exactly what Malkiel expected.  Lynch genius was to retire close to the top.  He retired at the young age of 46, when his record viewed over his tenure could still be perceived as legendary.<br />Warren Buffet case is completely different.  In Malkiel view, he is not so much an investment genius, as a businessman.  Buffet has often intervened in running the companies in which he invested when they were faltering.  This was the case for the Washington Post, Salomon Brothers, and many other companies Buffet invested in.  So, to compare Buffet?s record to the S&P 500 is comparing apples and oranges.  Buffet record can't be replicated by any regular investors who have no control over the companies they invest in.would have incurred only 16 quarterly losses with the worst one being only minus 5.0%.

This book builds a solid foundation on corporate applications of real options.  The author is an MD and has worked many years as a medical researcher.  Thus, she has a first hand knowledge in health care and pharmaceutical research.  She builds on this wealth of experience to develop many interesting examples of real options related to pharmaceutical drug development.  However, she is perfectly comfortable developing excellent examples across industries such as oil explorations, new product developments, and other traditional real option corporate applications.<br />The strengths of the book include an excellent foundation in financial option theory, a good explanation of the Black Scholes option model and the binomial option pricing model.  There is also an excellent section on the history of options which date back to the age of the Pharaohs and the Greeks.<br />The author does also a good job at outlining the weakness of the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis method of valuing projects.  DCF does not handle well uncertainty of projects outcome, and flexibility in management decision and investing schedule.  These weaknesses are just where real options excel.  One counterintuitive variable is that uncertainty, that corporate managers traditionally dislike, lowers the value of a project in DCF, but actually increases it in a real options framework.  This is not so strange when you consider that volatility is the main driver of options values within the Black Scholes model.<br />The overall weakness of this book is that many examples are not so well explained from a mathematical standpoint.  You are often left wanting more explanations to truly become comfortable using these techniques.<br />The experienced real option practitioner will find this book very interesting.  The novice who wants to build a practical foundation better turn to &quot;Real Options&quot; written by Martha Amram and Nalin Kulatilaka which does a better job at explaining the underlying basic calculations behind each examples.asic calculations behind each examples.	2003-09-01

The authors maintain you can use a 15 year moving average of various valuation indicators as a buy signal to invest in the S&P 500.  The indicators include: Price level, P/E ratio, Price/Book Value, Price/Cash Flow, Price/Sales.  Whenever the S&P 500 trades under its 15 year moving average on these indicators, it is a good time to buy.<br />They show that between 1977 and 2001 an investor using any of these indicators (P, P/E, P/B, P/CF, P/S)  to invest in the S&P 500 whenever it traded lower than its 15 year moving average would have beaten an investor doing dollar cost averaging with monthly investments over the same period.  One condition is that the market timer would invest $200 every month he had a buy signal, and not invest anything when he did not.  Meanwhile, the dollar-cost-averager would invest $100 on a monthly basis.  Over the entire period, the market timer gets to invest only $20,000 in the S&P 500 ($200 times 100 months).  Meanwhile, the dollar cost averager invests $30,000 in the S&P 500 ($100 times 300 months).  In each case, the market timer comes out ahead and ends up with more money in 2001.<br />The authors attempt to make a case that the market timer superior results (regardless of the indicator used) is due to buying into the market when it is low.  But, the success of the market timer is due to his accelerated equity investment schedule.  By early 1985, the market timer has made his full investment of $20,000 in equities.  By the same date, the dollar cost averager has invested only $10,000.  The dollar cost averager much slower investment schedule will never allow him to catch up to the market timer.  The dollar-cost-averager average holding period of his stock portfolio is only 12.5 years compared to 21.5 years for the market timer.  This is why the market timer wins.<br />The above example is repeated five times (once for each indicator) with the exact same flaw.  The accelerated equity investment schedule follows an identical pattern regardless of the indicator used.  What these guys did is called backtesting.  The authors looked at various moving averages such as 5, 10, and 15 years.  And, devised different investment rules until they came up with a combination of a moving average and a rule that would beat income averaging.  They did it, but ran into a methodological flaw (the frontloading of the investment) they were not even aware off.<br />Additionally, this investment strategy is most unrealistic.  Who could stomach investing twice as much as his regular investment schedule just when the market is experiencing a severe Bear market (that is what it takes for the market to go south of its 15 year moving average).<br />This strategy is not market timing.  Following this strategy you would have been locked out of making any additional equity investments since 1985.  Also, the authors do not have a \\"sell signal\\" spelled out because it would kill their strategy.  The stock market only rarely goes south of its 15 year moving average (regardless of the indicatory used) and quickly goes back up north of it.  Thus, with a sell signal you would never hold your S&P 500 holdings for long.  Yet, the authors stress that their strategy does not show superior returns until 15 to 20 years out.  The lack of a sell signal would have left you fully exposed on your S&P 500 holdings invested prior to 1985 to the crash of 1987, the downturn of 1989, and the severe Bear Market of 1999 to 2002.<br /><br />The authors give great credit to the investing principles developed by Benjamin Graham, the father of value investing.  Some of these principles include only buying companies who sell for less than their working capital and whose earnings yield is twice higher than their bond yield.  The only problem is that you could not find any stock meeting these criteria since 1950s.  These principles have become outdated as markets have become more efficient.<br />The authors strategy is almost as outdated as Benjamin Graham value investing principles.  The difference is that Graham wrote his book 30 years before his investing guidelines became obsolete.  Meanwhile, the authors wrote their book 18 years after their strategy was outdated in 1985.<br />They actually belittle the sound concepts of asset allocation and portfolio rebalancing.  They pretend that asset allocation has no merit because no one knows the future returns from equities and bonds.  However, we can construct a directionally correct asset allocation for different risk levels by inputting the respective equities and bonds returns historical mean, standard deviation, and correlation with each other.  On portfolio rebalancing, they suggest it is worthless since two investors who would have started the prior century with a 50/50 split, the one not rebalancing his portfolio to a 50/50 position yearly would have ended up far richer at the end of the century than the other one who did rebalance his portfolio yearly.  But, the investor who let his allocation drift from 50/50 to 99/1 (equity/bonds) incurred a far greater risk.  The authors ignored all that.

The title suggests the repeat of the theme exposed by Paul Kennedy in the 80s in his book \\"The Rise and Fall of Great Powers.\\"  But, the two books advance almost symmetrically opposed theories.  Paul Kennedy suggested that great powers eventually decline because they can't withstand the fiscal burden of maintaining a nonproductive military effort to govern their empire (the Imperial Overstretch concept).  Macdonald instead advances that a public bond market is a nation?s best tool in raising funds for emergencies such as warfare.  In Kennedy's book debt is bad.  In Macdonald it is good.<br />Macdonald's argument starts with the fiscal stress associated with having to raise huge amount of funds in preparation for warfare.  In such situation, raising taxes is impractical.  Often tax rates would have had to double or treble to raise adequate funds to finance wars throughout history.  A government can?t do that without causing a revolution.  Often what states and government did before the advent of well developed public bond markets was to mine their grounds (or grounds of conquered territories) for mineral riches (gold and silver).  The states would then hoard these gold reserves as funds available for a rainy day (war).  But, as Macdonald points out this treasure hoarding was most inefficient from an economic standpoint.<br />Public debt markets became a much preferred alternative to treasure hoarding for financing wars.  This was true for several reasons.  Treasure hoarding represented a huge amount of wasted capital not reinvested in the economy where it could have generated rapidly rising living standards for society at large.  Bond financing (public debt) was so much more flexible a tool for war financing than an ongoing tasking treasure hoarding mechanism.<br />Comparing two countries, one being a bond borrower, the other a treasure hoarder, one could readily observe that the bond borrower economy would grow much faster, and that it would have an easier time to finance wars when and as needed.  Typically, you run out of gold reserve faster than you run out of a state's borrowing capacity.<br />But, for a public debt market to thrive you need democratic institutions.  In democracies, the motivation of the government and its citizen are aligned.  This facilitates a trust between the creditors (citizens) and the borrower (the government).  As a result, democratic governments can borrow more and at a lower interest costs then other governments.  In other words, the creditors of a democratic government assess a lower credit and counterparty risk to a democratic government, and therefore demand a lower risk premium (lower interest rates).  This is Macdonald's main argument.  Therefore, he concludes that the pressure to create public credit markets to finance wars was an impetus to create public debt markets and in turn to develop democratic institutions.<br />Macdonald's theory is so current.  Today, it is self evident that the countries who have the most transparent disclosure, integer accounting system, accountable governance associated with democracies can borrow at a substantially lower cost than others.at it would have an easier time to finance wars when and as needed.

The beginning of the book provides an excellent summary of Islamic history, how it dominated the World during its Golden Age (600 to 1200); how it became the Ottoman Empire (1300 to 1920), but got ever weaker since the 1600s.  And, how the Ottoman Empire got dissolved as the Middle East was restructured during the French and British mandates at the end of WWI.<br />Lewis mentions three types of Muslims.  The first type hates everything about the West and always will.  This includes terrorists and fundamentalists.  The second type accepts the West because of its superior might.  But, this hides an animosity that will resurface the minute Islam regains enough power.  The third type likes the West, and looks forward to enjoy a higher quality of life.  This pro Western third type has little influence on the other two.<br />Historical reference plays a key role in the Muslim mindset.  Muslims remember the dates and places of every battles the Muslims won since Mohammed in the 600s CE.  They remember these with pride as their duty to convert the world to their own belief system.  They also remember equally well every defeat as insults imparted on their faith by infidels and crusaders. Osama Bin Laden often uses such historical references in his communications to motivate all Muslims to join Al-Qaida and mount a Jihad to fight the leader of the infidels the U.S.<br />This historical mindset is Islamic centric.  Besides a long list of Islamic victories and defeats, Muslims know very little of history or anything else.  Even though Islam was at the apex of scientific knowledge during its Golden Age, it has ever since fallen behind.  When you look at the number of scientific papers generated per capita per year in Arabic Muslim countries vs. the U.S., Japan, and Western Europe; there is no comparison whatsoever (see page 116 of book).  Similarly, Arabic Muslim countries translate only several hundred books per year.  This compares to more than 100,000 translated books per year in your average Western country.  Thus, Muslim countries have little access to modern knowledge.<br />The Arabic Muslim world does not compare well on measures of economic growth, quality of life, education, literacy rates, women rights, quality of governance.  For many Muslims the solution to all their problems is to reject modernization, and to return to what they view is a purer way of life.  Such attitude will cause Muslim societies to fall further behind.<br /><br />Islam embodies different domains including religion, law, government leadership, geography, and military activities.  Religion dominates politics, diplomacy.  Thus, political leaders such as Bush, and Blair are commonly referred as a crusaders or leaders of the infidels.  The media perpetrates lies to malign the West such as that 9/11 was a Jewish conspiracy to trigger attacks on Islam.<br />For the Muslims, the Quran represents a combination of the Bible, constitutional, civil, and commercial law, and a self help code of conduct, all rolled into one.  This fanatical allegiance to a 1400 years old document (Quran) makes it impossible for Muslim societies to modernize.  Also, of concern is that the interpretation of the Quran is increasingly radicalized in both a puritanical direction (rejecting greater freedom of women in the West) and violent intolerance of others.  Osama bin Laden frequently quotes the Quran to support his acts of terrorism against infidels.<br />The concept of a secular society is unacceptable for Muslims.  For them, any society whose rules and governments are not guided by religious principles represent infidels to be conquered and converted.  Muslims split the World in two houses: the House of Islam and the House of War.  The House of War represents the territories that the Muslims plan to conquer through Jihad to spread the word of God throughout the world.  Islamic Jihad is equivalent to the crusades of Christendom.  But, the difference is that the crusades were over 800 years ago.  Meanwhile, Jihad has much momentum today.<br />This view of the World suggests that tension with Islam will not be over when the Israel-Palestinian conflict will be resolved.  Out of the three types of Muslims mentioned above, two do not recognize the state of Israel.  And, for them the solution is to conquer it back, so it belongs again to Islam as it did 1400 years ago.<br />Given that the U.S. represents the major counterforce to the spread of Islam, Muslims have a special hatred towards it.  When the Russians invaded Afghanistan, it caused very little reaction within the Muslim World.  When Muslims ruthlessly kill their own, such as when Syrian President, a-Assad, ordered the complete demolition of Hama in 1982 killing over 20,000 innocent Syrian civilians that is OK.  When Saddam Hussein governs through a regime of cruelty killing hundreds of thousands of civilian Iraqis over that is OK too. But, the U.S. is blamed for everything that is wrong in the Muslim World.<br />Many terrorist acts were not due because relations between the U.S. and Middle Eastern governments were getting worse, but because they were getting better.  This was the case during the Iran crisis in the late seventies when Americans were held hostage for over a year.  The goal of such act was to create a wedge between the Iranian government and the U.S. whose relationship had warmed up considerably before this tragic event.<br />Lewis does not offer easy solution, and ends the book on this powerful note: If the fundamentalists are correct in their calculations and succeed in their war, then a dark future awaits the world, especially the part of it that embraces Islam.e over 800 years ago.  Meanwhile, Jihad has much momentum today.<br />This view of the World suggests that tension with Islam will not be over when the Israel-Palestinian conflict will be resolved.  Out of the three types of Muslims mentioned above, two do not recognize the state of Israel.  And, for them the solution is to conquer it back, so it belongs again to Islam as it did 1400 years ago.  <br />Given that the U.S. represents the major counterforce to the spread of Islam, Muslims have a special hatred towards it.  When the Russians invaded Afghanistan, it caused very little reaction within the Muslim World.  When Muslims ruthlessly kill their own, such as when Syrian President, a-Assad, ordered the complete demolition of Hama in 1982 killing over 20,000 innocent Syrian civilians that is OK.  When Saddam Hussein governs through a regime of cruelty killing hundreds of thousands of civilian Iraqis over that is OK too. But, the U.S. is blamed for everything that is wrong in the Muslim World.  <br />Many terrorist acts were not due because relations between the U.S. and Middle Eastern governments were getting worse, but because they were getting better.  This was the case during the Iran crisis in the late seventies when Americans were held hostage for over a year.  The goal of such act was to create a wedge between the Iranian government and the U.S. whose relationship had warmed up considerably before this tragic event.   <br />Lewis does not offer easy solution, and ends the book on this powerful note: If the fundamentalists are correct in their calculations and succeed in their war, then a dark future awaits the world, especially the part of it that embraces Islam.	2003-08-23

Bill Emmott, Chief Editor of The Economist paints a broad brush on current world economic and geopolitical trends.  He benchmarks the relative strengths of the U.S., EU, China, and Japan.  He also covers Globalization and the challenge of the Islamic countries.  His analysis is right on the mark.  But, watch out for his facts and stats.  They are often wrong.  I disclose some of the most egregious examples within my review below.  How can the Chief Editor of The Economist be so sloppy with stats and facts beats me.  If he had his facts straight, I would have given this book a 5 rating, because otherwise his analysis is excellent.<br />Regarding the U.S., Bill Emmott is an enthusiastic supporter.  He sees the U.S. as the most benevolent hegemonic power in the history of mankind.  The U.S. is the first World power that does not attempt to dominate outright, but to prosper by making all other countries prosper.  This is manifested by the U.S. ongoing support for international trade, and prosperity Worldwide.  He recognizes that the U.S. in its effort to police terrorism will often use unilateral actions.  Unlike other European commentators, he is perfectly all right with that.  He sees U.S. unilateralism as the inevitable result of the number one power assuming its responsibilities in the World arena.  If the World does not have a leading dominant power, it typically leads to chaos, tension, and warfare.<br />However, Bill Emmott grossly overstated the military power of the U.S.  He stated that U.S. defense spending is nearly 10 times greater than the next 14 countries put together.  This is absurd.  The facts are that U.S. defense spending is 12% greater than the next 14 countries put together.  Also, the U.S. defense spending represents nearly 50% of World defense spending.  That is strong enough.  It is unexplainable how the editor of The Economist could miss such basic stats.<br />However, he is right on regarding his analysis of the U.S. success.  The U.S. economic success is due to its much higher risk tolerance in the business arena.  This has created a superior climate for risk taking, innovation, technology, entrepreneurship, capital formation, productivity, and rising living standard.  This risk taking mentality has created a virtuous cycle of economic growth.  Along the same lines, the U.S. has far more flexible labor markets than anywhere else, as U.S. companies are much freer to hire and fire employees in response to the ups and downs of business cycles.<br />China is an emerging economic power.  Its economic power will translate into stronger assertiveness in World Affairs.  The U.S. will have to deal with this emerging political power, and it won?t be easy.  The Taiwan issue will continue to be a thorn in the side of the U.S. China relationship.  Over time, China wants to takeover Taiwan.  And, an abrupt disruption of China?s communist party would make such a takeover increasingly likely.  Obviously, this would be a great source of tension between China and the U.S.<br />Japan current position in World standing is steadily declining.  It has a lot of economic resource and human capital.  But, right now it is being wasted due the government?s refusal to clean up the country financial mess.  Japan will be stuck in ongoing economic stagnation until it tackles its numerous financial problems, it deregulates its economy, and open its markets.  This is a tall order for Japan, and the outlook is for ongoing economic stagnation for a long time.  This may make the political establishment vulnerable to extremists.<br />Bill Emmott grossly overstates the economic performance of the EU.  He suggests that the EU economy has grown much faster than the U.S. over the past two decades.  Only in your dreams Mr. Emmott, the truth is just the contrary.  During the past two decades, the U.S. GDP has grown by 3.2% per year vs. only 2.2% for the EU countries (per OECD data).  Again, how can you explain that the chief Editor of The Economist would flunk this question.  Besides that Emmott mentions a few European trends including their reliance on exhausting periods of \\"muddling through.\\"  He describes muddling through as finding uncomfortable (often ineffective) compromises to accommodate each country's concerns among an ever-widening group of countries and issues.  He views this process as often maddening, and the main reason why the EU will not play a dominant role in World affairs.<br />His analysis of globalization is sound.  He considers globalization as a positive economic force around the World.  He notes that half a century ago there were few rich countries and a majority of poor countries.  Now, the situation has nearly reversed itself because of globalization.  He adds that poor countries have not been hurt by globalization and capitalism, but rather by their own poor government policies and their lack of institutional foundation to allow for progress.<br />He indicates that the Islamic countries are struggling for self respect, as they are obsessed by their historical memories of the Islamic Golden Age from 700 to 1200 AD when Islam was far ahead of the West.  Unfortunately, poor government policies have set these countries backward, and has created a [influenced] by Mosques anti American teaching become terrorists.<br />Terrorism can't be fought adequately through the international institutional frameworks, as terrorists have no consideration for international laws and treaties.  The author sees the U.S. unilateral actions as the only potent way to counter terrorism, and render our planet safer.  This is a rather positive perspective coming from a European.  I gather this reflects the author's  British nationality, as the U.K. has a pro Anglo Saxon stand which is much different from Europe?s mainland.The Economist would flunk this question.

(Significant Issues Series)	Books	5	15	16	N	Y	Good review of the impact of global aging on the financial m	The author reviews numerous economic forecasts measuring the impact of global aging on the financial markets.  Global aging is a looming major macroeconomic event.  The huge baby boom generation will start retiring in 2011.  By 2025, the entire baby boom generation will have retired.  During this period, the baby boomers will be drawing down on their pension and retirement funds.  The baby boomers draw downs will put huge downward pressure on bonds and stocks prices.<br />Pension funds will experience rising negative cash flows as their benefit claims will surpass their contributions.  In the U.S. for defined benefit pension plans, Schieber and Shoven forecast that the gap between benefit claims and contributions will deepen from - 1.5% of payroll in 2040 to - 4% in 2065.<br />Regarding precise equity return outlook there is little consensus.  The study from Schieber and Shoven forecasts that real equity returns will decline from an historical 8% down to 5%.  Another study by Jan Mantel from Merrill Lynch claims that equities will not decrease in price throughout the retirement of the baby boomers.  But, he did not express by how much equity returns would decline if equity prices grow at a slower than historical rate.  Other economists forecast worse scenarios including bear markets lasting decades.<br />There are three factors that will negatively affect equities.  The first one, as mentioned, is the baby boomers selling their stock holdings throughout their retirement years.  The second one is the pension funds changing their investment mix away from equities towards bonds and cash to meet upcoming liabilities associated with retirees.  Mantel forecasts that between 2000 and 2050 pension funds will reduce their equity allocation from 72% to 60% of investments in the U.K, from 63% to 54% in the U.S., from 45% to 30% in the Netherlands, and from 40% to 28% in Japan.  Because these four countries account for 80% of the World's private defined benefit pension assets, this shift in investment mix will represent a huge downward pressure on equity prices.  The third factor is an anticipated increase in worldwide interest rates associated with a rapid increase in government borrowing through the industrialized World to support government retirement systems and elders healthcare benefits.  Governments worldwide are ill prepared for the funding of these liabilities.  Roseveare, an OECD economist, predicts government debt will reach staggering levels by 2030, and represent 339% of GDP in Japan, over 200% throughout the EU, and 115% in the U.S.  These debt levels are a multiple of current levels.<br />Reviewing the investment outlook for the second quarter of this century (2025 to 2050), we derive the following:<br />1) Equity prices and returns will be affected by a decrease in demand;<br />2) International equities should fare worse than U.S. ones because both the EU and Japan have more rapidly aging population and have weaker fiscal position associated with higher government debt level;<br />3) Bond prices and returns will be affected by a staggering increase in supply due to rising government debt.  International bonds will be more vulnerable for the same reason as for equities;<br />4) Real estate will be affected by a declining demand associated with lower demographic growth and lower rate of household formation;<br />5) All medium to long term investments will be affected by a rise in real interest rates associated with a huge increase in government borrowing throughout the industrialized World to support government programs aimed at retirees.<br />There are several moderating factors that may reduce the impact of global aging.  However, these arguments are not convincing.  The first one is that all the above predictions regarding pension plans are associated with defined benefit plans where a pension fund pays a predetermined annuity to retirees.  Apparently, the more modern defined contribution plans (401K) would have a different and more robust cash flow than defined benefit plans.  Retirees would not draw down on their 401K holdings as quickly.  This makes sense, but the dollar amounts in defined contribution plans worldwide is small compared to defined benefit plans.<br />The most intriguing economic argument that would counteract the negative impact of global aging relates to equities demand and supply equilibrium.  If equities prices decline because of global aging, the cost of equity capital will go up for corporations.  As a result, corporations will issue less equity and instead finance growth with bonds.  Thus, the supply of equity will decrease and match the reduced demand for equity.  And equity returns and prices ultimately will not be affected by global aging.<br />Unfortunately the demand and supply equilibrium argument is flawed.  The reduction in equity supply, as depicted, will be minimal compared to the reduction in equity demand associated with pension funds selling equities both to meet retirees benefits and to shift their portfolio mix towards bonds.  Also, for corporations to steadily finance their growth through bond financing will further jack up real interest rates.  This is due to increasing bond supply and increasing the credit risk premium on corporate bonds.  This increase in real interest rates will hurt both bonds and equities.d more robust cash flow than defined benefit plans.  Retirees would not draw down on their 401K holdings as quickly.

This is an excellent book that will educate you on the foundation of Islam.  It describes the colorful life of its prophet, Muhammad.  He was unique in many ways.  He was a warrior and army chief commander.  He did not promote denial of earthly pleasures, as he is known to have had 13 wives and many concubines.  His revelations captured in the Quran recommends that one be limited to four wives.  These facts leave you baffled regarding the Muslims current views on the West as being so depraved and amoral.<br />The book provides an excellent study in comparative religion between the three monotheist religions: Christianity, Judaism, and Islam.  It is striking how similar these three religions are.  It actually is difficult to differentiate them.  Their respective differences rely on a set of technicalities that only a professor in theology would capture and remember.  One exception to this is one difference anyone can readily get.  Islam was polygamist.  Meanwhile, the other two religions were and still are monogamist.  This difference must have had an impact on women's status within Muslim societies.<br />This book is a work of history, it is not a treaty in political science.  Thus, it does not explain the current situation where Islam is exerting itself through violent means (terrorism), intolerance for any other religion, and hatred of the West.  It also does not explain the current violent tension between the Shiites and Sunnis, even though it clearly outlines their differences.  Shiites believe the leader of Islam should be part of Muhammad's blood lineage, while Sunnis believe Islam leaders should be elected.<br />To further your understanding of Islam from both a historical and political science perspective, I recommend the many books written on this subject by Bernard Lewis.	2003-08-02

As an example, he mentions how the European Community (EC) is a trading block that consists in a protectionist fortress that hinders free trade with trading partners outside the EC.<br />The advent of the EC, and the growing trade U.S. deficit has lead government officials to respond by developing a large trading block of its own to compete with the EC.  This entails an expansion of NAFTA to eventually include all Central and South American countries.<br />The author states that such a U.S. trade policy is misguided on several counts, because:<br />First, the U.S. already accounts for over 40% of trade with the Americas.  This share is far higher than either Japan or the EC share with the Americas.  Thus, the U.S. has nothing to gain from spending much energy on expanding NAFTA; it already has achieved the end goal of being by far the dominant trading partner within this region.<br />Second, the trade volume with Central and South America is minuscule compared to U.S. trade with Asia.<br />Third, it is triggering a response in kind from both Japan and China who are now both working on developing and expanding a large and competing Asian trading block.  The U.S. would loose a lot more market share of World Trade by this development (Asian trading block), than it would by expanding NAFTA.  The author states that the impetus of developing an Asian trading block is a direct reaction to the U.S. effort in expanding NAFTA.<br />Instead, the author suggests that the U.S. trade policy should be redirected along the following lines:<br />First, the U.S. should abandon its pursuit of forming protectionist trading blocks.<br />Second, it should promote free trade by giving its full support to the current round of the World Trade Organization (WTO).  This is a far better option to promote free trade then working on bilateral free trade agreements (FTA) that are really protectionist in nature towards all trading partners excluded from the FTAs.<br />Third, it should reduce or eliminate the tariffs it imposed on steel and textile.  These domestic industries do not need to be protected anymore.<br />Fourth, the U.S. should reduce its volume of agricultural subsidies.  By doing so, it will be in a position to pressure the EC, and specifically France, to reduce its own huge agricultural subsidies.<br />The author maintains that the U.S. misguided trade policy emanates from a misperception from the public and Congress regarding the U.S. trade performance.  The perception is that U.S. is performing poorly in international trade as it incurs large trade deficits, and is getting routinely beaten by Japan, China, and the EC who routinely achieve large trade surpluses, especially with the U.S.  This view is based on an outdated Mercantilist perspective that states that exports and trade surpluses are good and imports and trade deficits are bad.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  What really matters is the productivity of the labor force which is the engine behind a country's economic growth and rising living standard.  Focusing on these more meaningful economic metrics (labor productivity, living standards, economic growth), the U.S. has beaten the socks out of its major trading partners, specifically Japan and the EC.<br />The author brings two other interesting points.  The first one is that the U.S. share of World trade has remained remarkably steady at around 12% to 13% over the past century.  This negates the perception that the U.S. performance in international trade is weaker now than it used to.  It clearly is not.  The other point is that the U.S. trade mix is almost evenly distributed between the EC, Asia, and North America (Canada and Mexico).  In other words, the U.S. has the most diversified and optimal mix of trading partners.  As mentioned above, its pursuit of expanding trading blocks with the Americas will cause theU.S. to be increasingly locked out of trades with the other two major regions (Asia and EC).  This would cause a decline in the U.S. diversification of trading partners.  This is clearly not a favorable development as demonstrated by the author.<br />In conclusion, this book is one of the most eloquent defense of true free trade.  It can also be viewed as an equally eloquent attack on the formation of trading blocks including NAFTA, and the EC.cause the U.S. to be increasingly locked out of trades with the other two major regions (Asia and EC).  This would cause a decline in the U.S. diversification of trading partners.  This is clearly not a favorable development as demonstrated by the author.  <br />In conclusion, this book is one of the most eloquent defense of true free trade.

Harry Dent poses as an economist but he is not.  He also poses as a demographer but he is not either.  As a consequence, he develops sweeping broadbased theories without solid scientific foundation.  His main theme is that the large Baby Boom generation is going through its peak spending years during this decade, and as a result it will sustain an economic and stock market boom until 2009.  He concludes that it is almost certain that the stock market will earn 10% and above returns throughout this decade.<br />However, when you look at the record so far, Harry Dent's prediction in 1999 for the first decade of 2000's is way off.  The ink was barely dry on his book when the stock market actually peaked (first quarter of 2000) and then tanked.  The stock market then suffered a three year bear market.  Current outlook for the stock market is for increased volatility, but reduced growth in the single digit range (not the double digit range, Dent predicted).<br />Dent missed a lot of things.  Some of them he could not have predicted such as heightened geopolitical risk, terrorism.  Some other factors, he should have predicted.  These included the overvaluation of stocks as a result of the Internet Bubble, the onset of World deflation associated with the flooding of cheap exports from China, the eventual slow down of the U.S. economy among others.<br />Dent also pauses as a futurist.  In this role, he just repeats what Alvin Toffler stated in Future Shock almost 30 years ago.  Technology will reform the workplace, will boost economic productivity, etc...  Nothing new or informative here.<br />The only somewhat valuable part of this book includes several recommendations for successful investing, including:<br />1) Save at least 10% of your salary;<br />2) Use buy and hold strategies, don't try to time the market;<br />3) Use mutual funds to most efficiently diversify your holdings;<br />4) Use asset allocation.  The greatest returns result from the correct asset allocation.  Asset allocation should match your personal risk tolerance; and<br />5) Invest systematically not emotionally.<br />However, the author did not support these good investment strategies with adequate useful details.

Nye makes a case that the U.S. Power is much overstated.  He views power among three dimensions.  The first dimension is Interstate Military issues.  This is the domain where the U.S. dominates.  Nye calls it \\"hard power\\".  The U.S. military budget represents half the entire World.  Its military capacity is unparalleled and unmatched.  The second dimension is Interstate Economic Issues.  This includes international treaties regarding international trade, antitrust and commerce, and financial regulations.  Here power is distributed on a multipolar basis.  Here, the U.S. can't achieve much in this area without the cooperation of the EU, Japan, and often China, India, and other major players.  The third dimension is Transnational Issues.  This domain includes international financial stability, drug trafficking, spread of diseases, global warming, other environmental issues, and terrorism.  Here power is widely distributed and chaotically organized among state and nonstate actors.<br />As described above, the U.S. supremacy is only applicable to one of three dimensions of the international politic arena.  The U.S. has more hard power (military and economic might) than anyone else.  But, the two other dimensions address issues that are resolved by soft power.  Soft power is the ability to negotiate, resolve issues without conflict, lead consensus, manage issues to your advantage.  Nye finds the U.S. soft power is rapidly declining.  This is because it has often opted right out of most of World treaties regarding the environment, World criminal courts, or other similar treaties.  Meanwhile, he sees Europe has having a far stronger position than the U.S. on the dimensions requiring soft power instead of hard power.<br />The truth of the matter is that when you have the Power you don't want it curtailed by supranational treaties.  When you don't have the power (such as the Europeans) you do want supranational treaties curbing the power that dominates you.  This is a rule that has remained true throughout history.<br />Also, Nye ignores the tremendous amount of soft power the U.S. has generated through private foundations of billionaires such as Ted Turner, Bill Gates, Soros, and many other Americans who fund a rising percentage of humanitarian projects to improve life in the Third World.  This aspect of soft power totally escaped Nye.  And, in this arena, the Americans are again dominant.<br />He further characterizes the U.S. huge discrepancy between its mighty hard power and its weakly soft power by focusing on budget expenditures.  Military and Defense (hard power agencies) spending represents 16% of the Federal Budget.  But, the State Department and U.S. Agency for International Development (more representative of soft power agencies) account for only 1% of Federal Budget.  In other words, the U.S. spends on soft power only 1/16th it spends on its hard power.  However, these numbers are not representative.  Obviously, the military costs a lot more to fund because of the high cost of stealth bombers, carriers, and other huge weapons.  Comparing these two sets of costs as representative of the U.S. investment in hard power vs. soft power is absurd.<br />If we revisit the three-dimensional model.  Nye makes a case that power is increasingly shifting away from the hard power military dimension to the other two that are more soft power oriented.  In other words, your going to resolve a declining percentage of the World conflicts and issues with GPS guided missiles and more with loose cooperation between governments, and nongovernment entities exchanging information.<br />This power shift within the three dimensions suggests that the U.S. should shift away from a unilateral foreign policy stand, and rejoin the multilateral arena with Europe and others.  The U.S. can't expect support of its allies when it needs them, if it chose to ignore them whenever it did not need them.  Nye therefore also calls for the U.S. to commit to support theUN, NATO, and other supranational entities, just as Europe does.<br />But, Nye arguments are flawed.  He has a biased European view.  When observing objectively what has the soft power European way achieved lately vs. the hard power unilateral U.S. approach, you reach very different conclusions.  We are undeniably in a Pax Americana era, as the U.S. is the only entity able to maintain order around the Globe.  The U.S. is sometimes hated, but always respected.  These are the assets and liabilities of being number one.  This has been true throughout history.<br />The U.S. is the major force around the World regardless of framework.  The U.S. has done a tremendous amount over the past decades in opening World Trade.  Its open markets associated with large trade deficits actually supports the entire World trading system.  It goes without saying that the U.S. has saved Europe from Nazism, and Communism.  Today, the U.S. is a far more dynamic and potent force in resolving all the related Middle Eastern issues than Europe is.  Europe is viewed as a passive player because it does not have the military capability to support an effective foreign policy.<br />Additionally, Nye has a cult for the UN.  But, this international body has become dysfunctional and is unable to respond to hot situations around the World as they emerge.<br />I agree with Nye that the U.S. should exert its unilateral hard power in a much less arrogant way.  A better style may go a long way in sustaining the substance of our foreign policies.  But, to state that Europe has actually more overall power than the U.S. because it has supposedly much more soft power than the U.S. on two out of the three power dimensions is nonsense.  Soft power backed by hard power (military or economic power) is meaningful.  Soft power backed by nothing is not power.  For a far better book on the same subject read: \\"Power and Paradise\\" by Robert Kagan.o commit to support the UN, NATO, and other supranational entities, just as Europe does. <br />But, Nye arguments are flawed.  He has a biased European view.  When observing objectively what has the soft power European way achieved lately vs. the hard power unilateral U.S. approach, you reach very different conclusions.

Today, the U.S. is a far more dynamic and potent force in resolving all the related Middle Eastern issues than Europe is.  Europe is viewed as a passive player because it does not have the military capability to support an effective foreign policy.  <br />Additionally, Nye has a cult for the UN.  But, this international body has become dysfunctional and is unable to respond to hot situations around the World as they emerge.<br />I agree with Nye that the U.S. should exert its unilateral hard power in a much less arrogant way.  A better style may go a long way in sustaining the substance of our foreign policies.  But, to state that Europe has actually more overall power than the U.S. because it has supposedly much more soft power than the U.S. on two out of the three power dimensions is nonsense.  Soft power backed by hard power (military or economic power) is meaningful.  Soft power backed by nothing is not power.  For a far better book on the same subject read: \\"Power and Paradise\\" by Robert Kagan.	2003-07-31

This is an excellent book that teaches the basics of RealPolitik whereby wise pragmatism supersedes unrealistic and immature moral principals to ensure much better foreign policies.  In this short book, Kagan covers a huge amount of ground.  He presents the writings and lessons derived from the best Chinese, Greek, Roman, Renaissance, and Enlightenment philosophers focused on military strategic thinking, warfare, and foreign policy.<br />Kagan explains how public virtue which characterizes the necessary pragmatism to be effective in foreign policy is much different from private virtue.  He mentions the example of Franklin Roosevelt who coerced, manipulated, and lied to Congress in an effort to engage the U.S. in fighting the Germans in WWII.  Roosevelt knew this was a war he had to take on, yet he also knew Congress would never approve it outright.  So, Roosevelt did what he had to do to make it happen.  Kagan mentions the famous quote by Miller: \\"Mankind is in debt to his lies\\" describing Roosevelt during this specific period.<br />Kagan own writing is just as quotable as the ones from all the historic luminaries he refers to.  Here is a good example: \\"With their incessant harping on values, today's Republicans and Democrats alike often sound less like Renaissance pragmatists [reference to the brilliant Machiavelli] than like medieval churchmen, dividing the world sanctimoniously between good and evil.\\"  In other words, our own two party system political values have much in common with the obsessive religious fundamentalists of all stripe we so despise.<br />Kagan also supports a revival of Malthusian theories.  Kagan mentions that the English Revolution of 1640, the French Revolution of 1789, the European revolts of 1848, and numerous rebellions in the Chinese and Ottoman empires all occurred against a background of high population growth and food shortages.  Kagan states that many present and future conflicts will be Malthusian in nature.  In this context, he is referring about all the tribal warfare plaguing Africa currently and into the future.  Other areas subject to Malthusian laws include the Middle East (population growth is outpacing fixed limited water resources) and Central Asia.<br />Kagan foresees how the implementation of our Constitutional laws will change to adapt to modern warfare.  In this regard, he mentions that the majority of future conflicts will consist in small wars, rescue operations, preemptive strikes that will go unsanctioned by Congress and the citizenry.  Going to war will be less and less a democratic decision, he states.  He adds that our own laws forbidding the assassination of foreign leaders is both totally obsolete and cruel to citizens worldwide.  \\"Would it have been more humane to assassinate Milosevic and his inner circle rather than bomb Serbia for ten weeks\\".  Kagan's question is also the obvious answer.referring about all the tribal warfare plaguing Africa currently and into the future.

This book is speculative based on a flawed forecasting.  King Hubbert made a famous prediction in 1956 that U.S. oil production would peak between 1965 and 1970.  His forecasting methodology was to estimate the total U.S. oil supply that was and will ever be available for production.  This quantity is known as the Ultimate.  This Ultimate is equal to Cumulative Historical Production + Reserves + Undiscovered Potential.  Mr. Hubbert?s next step was to fit the Ultimate as the surface under a normally distributed Bell Curve with the X-axis representing time (years date: 1956, 1957, 1958) and the Y-axis representing an estimate of annual production in any given year.  The Peak is equal to the midpoint on this curve and represents the year at the half life of U.S. oil supply.  It also represents the \\"peak\\" highest annual production.  Every year after that would experience ever declining production following the declining right side of a normal distribution Bell curve.  Kenneth Deffeyes extends the same methodology to the whole World oil supply, and infers that the peak will be reached between 2004 and 2008, and thereafter, oil production will decline very rapidly.<br /><br />What is wrong with that methodology?  A lot, as will see.  I tested King Hubbert prediction by plotting U.S. crude oil annual production from 1949 to 2001.  I found out that the data is far more dispersed than a normal distribution is.  Thus, King Hubbert use of a normal distribution is incorrect, and will lead to erroneous forecasts.  Giving Mr. Hubbert a break, I figured what he really meant was symmetry from the peak.  Thus, if you know the production in the peak year, you can forecast the production in the out years after that.  Well, using this technique, I figured the production level 10 years after the peak (in 1980) should be the equal to the one 10 years before the peak (1960), and so on and so forth.  This should be true even if the data was perfectly normally distributed or not.  Doing so, I found that King Hubbert forecast underestimated actual U.S. oil production by 22% in 1980, 32% in 1985, and 36% in 1990.  This is as far as I could go, given that I had no data before 1949.<br /><br />In view of the above, King Hubbert was really lucky in projecting the peak year to be between 1965 and 1970 (actual was in 1970), but his methodology totally missed the mark in forecasting U.S. oil production after 1970.<br /><br />Why was King Hubbert's forecast so off?  Besides the statistical technicalities (data not normally distributed) the main reason is that he missed the oil production from Alaska.  In all fairness, he did conduct his forecast before Alaska became a state.  But, I am not aware that he ever revised his forecast; meanwhile he certainly should have.  Alaska started producing oil in 1959, but peaked in 1988.  Thus, the life cycle of the Alaskan oil fields were totally different from the ones of the 48 lower states.  Thus, for any prediction regarding oil production, it has to be done at the oil field level, not at a national level (or even worst World level).  To streamline the data, you could group oil fields by starting date of oil production, and types (different geological conditions must lead to different production curves).  Once you have your portfolio of oil field buckets so defined, you could observe the oil production level behavior of each bucket.  With this data, you could then develop a Monte Carlo simulation with a few random variables that would influence oil production (oil price, conservation effort, etc.).  From this you would develop a much richer output giving you a range of probability for specific oil production levels in any given year.  Anything short of this effort won?t tell you anything statistically meaningful.<br /><br />When Kenneth Deffeyes extends the Hubbert methodology to the whole World he runs into other major roadblocks.  Deffeyes has no idea what is the actual reserve level in the Middle East.  This is not his fault, no one does.  As mentioned in the book, Middle Eastern oil producers artificially boosted their reserve level numbers in the late eighties when OPEC started to allocate selling quotas proportional to countries reserves.  However, the industry consensus is that these reserves were grossly understated before the late eighties.  Thus, no one knows reserve numbers good enough for forecasting purposes.<br /><br />Deffeyes also makes a weak case that we have essentially discovered all the oil there is.  I don?t think so.  There is much oil field development going on in Russia and Kazakhstan.  Additionally, the U.S. has greatly curtailed its oil production potential due to environmental restrictions affecting the Alaska Northern Wildlife Refuge, and the two coasts (California, Florida).  These environmental regulations will be moderated or lifted as oil supply becomes a severe economic constraint.  Similarly, I am not convinced that the Middle Eastern oil fields have been exploited to the limit of current technology.  As we speak, Iraq's production is only progressively moving forward to its full potential.  Thus, Deffeyes prediction will run in many \\"Alaska\\" type errors just as Hubbert did.  His forecast will be just as flawed.  Predicting the peak is one thing.  Predicting how oil production declines over the next three decades is a lot more challenging and valuable to society.  It is this aspect of the forecast that totally eludes Hubbert and Deffeyes methodology.<br /><br />Another of Deffeyes miscalculation is his belief that our society could very rapidly adapt to a post-oil economy.  In other words, hydrogen and other fuel could quickly replace oil as the supporting fuel of our civilization.  This is nuts.<br /><br />Mr. Deffeyes is a Cassandra on the oil outlook.  Oil production will more than likely decline far slower than he predicts.  But, he is a utopic Pollyanna on the oil energy substitution outlook.  In other words, he is wrong on all counts.is fault, no one does.

First published in 1989, this book provides you a strong foundation in understanding the Middle East current issues.  The author explains how the French and the British in the 1920s created a set of countries after the collapse of the Ottoman Empire that represented no more than lines in the sand.  Often these lines contradicted the ethnicity, and religious affiliations of the affected populations.<br />The French created Syria, and Lebanon.  Syria was predominantly Muslim.  And, so was Lebanon.  But, the French installed a Christian minority in power in Lebanon who had a stronger affiliation with the French than the other groups.  The majority of the Lebanese population were Muslims split between Sunnis and Shiites.  Both the Sunnis and the Shiites would have preferred joining the Muslims in neighboring Syria, but had no say in the matter.  The much faster demographic growth of the Muslims caused rising tension and ongoing violence with the Christian minority lead government.<br />Additionally, the Sunnis and the Shiites were often at war with each other.  So, it is not like Islam is one unified monotheist religion at peace with itself.  Instead, it is a very fragmented religion.  It is undergoing the equivalent of the Reformation era that Christianity suffered 400 years ago when Catholics and Protestants were killing each other over minute difference in interpretation of the same religion.<br />As we know, the story of Israel is even more explosive than Lebanon.  In 1921, the British carved out the former Palestine division of the Ottoman Empire into two.  The Eastern half became Jordan, and the Western half became a contested territory between Palestinian Arabs and Zionist Jews.  An ongoing migration of European Jews until and after the end of WWII caused a rising tension between the two groups.  This turned into ongoing violent civilian unrest that the British could not control anymore.  The Brits left, and the UN took over.  In 1947, the UN declared a formal partition of the territory into a Palestinian State (West Bank, Gaza) and a Jewish State.  The Zionist Jews declared Israel statehood in 1948.  A day later all neighboring countries immediately attacked Israel.  But, Israel held its own.  While Egypt took over the Gaza District, and Jordan annexed the West Bank.  In 1967, a second war erupted and Israel expanded its territory and occupied West Bank and Gaza District.  The tension between Arabs and Jews has not abated since.<br />The tension between Israelis and Palestinians has lasted over 80 years.  After reading this book, you realize how difficult a sustainable peace resolution is.  Tribal politics are prevalent throughout the region, and lead to a winner take all mentality.  Negotiations and diplomacy are skills that are not utilized much in this region.  Thomas Friedman gives you a sense that the \\"Land for Peace\\" motto so promoted in the West is actually utopic.  There has been many \\"Land for Peace\\" deals offered to the Palestinians during the past couple of decades, but they were always immediately turned down by Arafat and the PLO, and quickly accompanied by a rise in terrorism and suicide bombing.

Summary and rating comment:<br />This book economics theory is flawed.  It assumes that foreign central banks hang on to 100% of the accumulated U.S. current account deficits.  Instead, the U.S. current account deficit gets reinvested in U.S. assets.  He explains that overseas banking crisis since 1977 were triggered by large U.S. current account deficits.  But, these deficits got materially large only after 1998.  The author maintains that U.S. households and businesses have deteriorating balance sheets.  Meanwhile, a review of Fed data shows the opposite.  Flawed economic assumptions go on and on within this book.<br /><br />Abstract:<br />The author states that the foreign banking crisis in the eighties and nineties were caused by the U.S. running large current account deficits.  These U.S. deficits caused a built up in dollar currency reserves of the exporting countries central banks.  These excess reserves caused lending booms, and asset valuation booms.  These ultimately lead to banking crisis due to borrowers defaulting on their loans which financed overvalued collateral.<br /><br />His explanation of foreign banking crisis ignores the basic international accounting equality that current account deficits equal net foreign investments flowing back into the U.S.  He states that foreign central banks reserves increased by the same amount as the U.S. current account deficits.  They did not, as U.S. current account deficits get reinvested in U.S. assets by the foreign exporting countries.  Thus, foreign central banks do not hold on to their countries current account surpluses.<br /><br />Additionally, the author mentions 24 countries which suffered banking crisis between 1977 and 1997 all due to the infamous U.S. current account deficits.  But, the U.S. current account deficits never exceeded $150 billion until 1998.  This deficit level is peanuts within a global trading system measured in $trillions.  Thus, the U.S. current account deficit can?t possibly explain foreign banking crisis going back to 1977.<br /><br />Many of the countries he mentioned that experienced banking crisis in the nineties (Indonesia, Korea, Malaysia, Philippines, Thailand) were actually running large current account deficits themselves.  Thus, current account surpluses were not a factor in their respective banking crisis.<br /><br />The author also states that the current account deficit caused an asset inflation boom in the U.S. particularly in stocks and real estate.<br /><br />Here, the author runs into a contradiction that he chooses to ignore.  How can the same U.S. current account deficits cause an asset inflation in both the exporting countries and the U.S. (importer).  As mentioned, they certainly are not responsible for the asset inflation within the exporting countries.  They could have caused asset inflation in the U.S. since these current account deficits have gotten reinvested as direct foreign investments in the U.S.  But, the U.S. incurred a stock market boom from 1995 to 1999 when the current account deficit was not that high.  And, it suffered a bear market since early 2000, when the current account deficit got significantly larger.  These outcomes are the opposite of what the author theory suggests.<br /><br />The author also mentions highly inflated real estate prices.  Meanwhile, U.S. commercial real estate valuation have been lackluster for the past decade.  Residential real estate is really a local market that varies greatly from one county to another.  At all times the U.S. will have residential markets that appear overvalued and others who appear cheap (nothing to do with current account deficits here).<br /><br />The author makes a popular case that the U.S. current account deficit level is not sustainable, because the U.S. can't borrow that much.  Well, is that really the case?  We are really talking of prepaid self financing here.  If China experiences a $100 billion current account surplus with the U.S., we actually pay the Chinese that money upfront.  They don't have to raise a dime themselves to reinvest this $100 billion back into the U.S.  These foreign direct investments are broadly diversified between bonds, stocks, and direct investments.  If we look at the U.S. net foreign investment position divided by the U.S. net worth (assets minus liabilities of individuals, businesses, and government), this ratio is only 6.3%.  Several countries have foreign investment position ratio 50% or greater than the U.S.  Australia has a ratio equal to 14%, Canada is 10%.  I developed a model showing that the U.S. could sustain its level of current account deficit level for another 20 years to reach the same net foreign investment position as Australia today.  And, Australia is no basket case.  Its economy is doing a lot better than Europe and Japan.  So, the U.S. current account deficit appears sustainable for at least a couple of decades.<br /><br />The author maintains that the U.S. consumers and businesses are already dangerously over leveraged, and thus, he expects rising defaults.  However, actual Fed data contradicts him.  Household balance sheets remain strong.  At 2002 yearend, household debt represented only 24% of household equity.  Meanwhile, businesses have steadily improved their balance sheet over the past two decades, as their respective Debt/Equity ratio declined from 150% in 1980 to 82% in 2002.  The author supports his theory with media headlines on corporate failures (Enron, WorldCom).  But, these are isolated attention grabbing incident.  Looking at the balance sheet of the whole economy, as we did, you get a different picture.  Unfortunately, dull good news never sells.<br /><br />The author's theory that the U.S. current account deficit is the cause for the World's deflation is ludicrous.  The cause is China's exporting boom Worldwide.  Also, China is buying dollars to keep the Chinese Yuan artificially low relative to the dollar and maintain its export surplus with the U.S.  Thus, deflation is a Chinese phenomenon associated with its being the lowest cost producer and its manipulating the value of its currency.he Chinese that money upfront.

It reviews in depth its economics, politics, and demographics.<br />Abstract:<br />Globalization is the Post Cold War order.  It represents the worldwide spread of free-market capitalism.  The more you let market forces rule and the more you open your economy to free trade and competition, the more efficient and flourishing your economy will be.  It is the world order of the Information Age.  There are now two worlds: the Fast World (industrialized) that is fully adapted to globalization and the Slow World that is not (Africa, Islamic Middle East, Central Asia).<br />The Lexus represents innovation, technology, and global markets.  The Olive Tree represents tradition and community identity.  Globalization represents the impact that the Lexus has on the Olive Tree.  The challenge is to insure that the Lexus and Olive Tree do not disrupt each other.  Innovation should not hurt tradition, and tradition should not hinder innovation.<br /><br />Globalization is built around three balances: 1) between nations; 2) between nations and capital markets; and 3) between nations and \\"super-empowered individuals\\" (SEIs).  Osama bin Laden, and Bill Gates are SEIs.  They can leverage much resources or capital to further (for good or bad) their respective objectives.  Globalization with its access to information has given SEIs more power than ever.<br />The main global player is the \\"Electronic Herd.\\"  It represents all the institutional traders, and hedge funds who allocate capital worldwide at the click of a mouse.  The Electronic Herd searches for optimal return on capital given specific risk levels.  The Electronic Herd is the live nervous system of the world's capital markets (New York, London, Paris, Hong Kong).  The capital markets of stocks, bonds, and currencies is the ruler of the world economy.  Joining the global economy is \\"taking a country public.\\"  And, governments become accountable to the Electronic Herd members who are its shareholders and bondholders.<br />The Rules of Success to join the global system.<br />1) Countries must embrace transparency and international standards in markets and accounting, limit corruption, promote freedom of the press.<br />2) They must get \\"Fast\\" by empowering entrepreneurs, and readily adopting new technologies, and developing new markets for products and services.  Japan has problems here because of a flawed political system.<br />3) Countries must get \\"light\\" emphasizing new information technologically driven industries instead of old smokestack industries.  The new industries use miniaturization and digitization to produce value with much less physical weight than older industries.<br />4) A country must open itself up to trade, competition, markets.  Openness attracts investment and technology from the Electronic Herd.  Again, Japan is struggling here.<br />5) Countries must choose leaders who understand and promote globalization.  Many leaders instead support protectionist policies that are self defeating.<br />6) Countries must position themselves just like consumer product brand.  Government officials have to nurture their brand value.  This is done by maintaining a sound track record in social, fiscal, and monetary policies, and in economic performance.<br />Depending on how well a government follows these rules, its economy will either thrive or not.  The following countries did not follow these rules well enough during the nineties, and all experienced economic crisis: Thailand, Korea, Malaysia, Indonesia, Mexico, Russia, and Brazil.  The Electronic Herd laid bare their flawed governments.  Russia attempted to plug into the international capital markets without the necessary infrastructure to succeed.  Russia had no legitimate oversight, no rule of law to enforce contracts and protects investors.  This lead to the Russian recession and bond default in the late nineties.<br /><br />The politics of globalization do not follow a conventional Republican vs. Democrat division.  Instead, they run along two axis.  The first one represents the acceptance of globalization.  On the far right of this axis, you have the \\"Integrationists\\" who welcome globalization and promote it through market competition, free trade, and technology.  It is the Lexus camp.  At the far left of this axis, you have the \\"Separatists\\" who believe globalization is bad.  They fight it by supporting protectionist policies, and regulating  technological change.  They represent the \\"Olive Tree.\\"<br />The second axis runs vertically represents the acceptance of government support to go along with globalization.  At the southern end, you have the \\"Social Democrats\\" who believe that globalization will be sustainable only if it is democratized in both economic and political sense.  At the northern end, you have the \\"Libertarians\\" who believe that unregulated markets should rule.  They want to shrink government, taxes, and safety nets, and let people reap the fruits of their own labor or pay the price of their ineptitude.  Bill Clinton was an Integrationist/Social Democrat.  While, Newt Gingrich, the former Speaker of the House, was an Integrationist/Libertarian.  That's why Clinton and Gingrich were allies on free trade, but opponents on welfare spending.  George W. Bush is a moderate Integrationist/Libertarian.  He is quicker to promote trade than social spending.<br />Thomas Friedman is a Integrationist/Social Democrat.  He believes you have to implement a safety net to support the people not equipped for the information age to promote social stability.  If you don't, an angry underclass will cause civil unrest.  This is true in the international arena too.  If we don't help Africa, the Islamic Middle East, and Central Asia catch up, their rising resentment will trigger a rise in terrorism.<br /><br />Thomas Friedman is a proponent of globalization.  Capital flows should be as free as possible.  Capital flows reward good governance and punish bad one.  However, he feels that the Electronic Herd should be reigned in by regulating the leverage traders can take on.  His concern is the systemic risk resulting from the near failure of the hedge fund, Long Term Capital Management (LTCM) in the late nineties.  If it had not been recapitalized by investment banks coerced by Allan Greenspan, LTCM failure could have disrupted the global capital markets.ics of globalization do not follow a conventional Republican vs. Democrat division.

While, Newt Gingrich, the former Speaker of the House, was an Integrationist/Libertarian.  That's why Clinton and Gingrich were allies on free trade, but opponents on welfare spending.  George W. Bush is a moderate Integrationist/Libertarian.  He is quicker to promote trade than social spending. <br />Thomas Friedman is a Integrationist/Social Democrat.  He believes you have to implement a safety net to support the people not equipped for the information age to promote social stability.  If you don't, an angry underclass will cause civil unrest.  This is true in the international arena too.  If we don't help Africa, the Islamic Middle East, and Central Asia catch up, their rising resentment will trigger a rise in terrorism.<BR>  <BR>Thomas Friedman is a proponent of globalization.  Capital flows should be as free as possible.  Capital flows reward good governance and punish bad one.  However, he feels that the Electronic Herd should be reigned in by regulating the leverage traders can take on.  His concern is the systemic risk resulting from the near failure of the hedge fund, Long Term Capital Management (LTCM) in the late nineties.  If it had not been recapitalized by investment banks coerced by Allan Greenspan, LTCM failure could have disrupted the global capital markets.	2003-07-19

The economic miracle of the eighties did not grow much after 1989.  He suggests economic reforms that would restore sustainable economic growth.  But, he indicates such reforms are unlikely until Japan reforms its political system first.  This means splitting the powerful LDP into two parties.  This will not happen shortly.  But, the building pressure for political reform as a result of the ongoing faltering economy is immense.  Thus, Mr. Katz is confident it will happen.<br />Abstract: Japan has gone from experiencing the \\"Japanese miracle\\" in the eighties to being in the economic doghouse since 1989.  During the eighties, Japan economy grew at 4% per year with little inflation and unemployment.  During the nineties, Japan experienced no economic growth, suffered deflation due to weak consumer demand; and. its share of World GDP and World exports shrunk.  Japan sustainable growth rate has decreased from 4% in the eighties to only 1% in 2000, on its way to only 0.5% by 2010.  Japan?s GDP grew by only 0.3% per annum since 1997.  Why did this economic decline occurr? There are really two Japanese economies.  One consists of the super efficient exporting industries, including automobiles and consumer electronics.  The other consists of the much larger domestic sector which employs 80% of labor force.  The domestic sector is protected from competition by an anticompetitive regulatory environment that allows price collusion and restricts all imports.  This sector includes food processing, retailing, wholesaling , finance, farming, and other services.  Within these domestic industries, Japan?s productivity is between 50% to 66% lower than in the U.S.<br />During the eighties the productive exporting sector was carrying the inefficient domestic sector.  But, in the nineties, the exporting sector progressively outsourced manufacturing overseas to lower its costs and remain competitive.  As a result, the lagging domestic sector employing a rising percentage of the labor force caused a decline in Japanese productivity.<br />Japan suffers many structural problems.  Its companies are overleveraged, and have over invested in nonproductive investments.  This has caused Japan chronic nonperforming loans (NPLs) problem.  These NPLs represent a staggering 20% of GDP.  The banking system generates these NPLs faster than it can charge them off.  This crisis has been going on since 1989.  Both the government and the banking industry have refused to make the tough decisions to resolve these NPLs.  The allocation of credit is fraught with conflict of interests.  Risk management is lackluster.  The banking industry is the weakest among industrialized nations.<br />Why are current monetary and fiscal stimuli not working? The Japanese central bank has maintained short term interest rates close to 0% for most of the past decade.  The government has run large budget deficits (around 6% of GDP) for several years.  But, despite these measures, economic growth has remained flat.  The reason is industry suffers from excess capacity.  As a result, loan demand is close to zero and so is the resulting economic growth.<br />Is the U.S. likely to experience the same fate? Some believe that the U.S. economy is experiencing a decade later the same economic ills as Japan.  Mr. Katz makes a convincing case that the U.S. and Japan are on different economic paths.  As mentioned, Japan economy is plagued by NPLs representing 20% of GDP.  Japan?s banking sector is weak.  Also, its long term sustainable economic growth rate is only 1%.  Meanwhile, the U.S. has no NPLs problem, as NPLs represent only 2.4% of GDP.  It has a well capitalized banking system.  Also, its long term sustainable growth rate remains robust at 4%.  Contrary to Japan, the U.S. has the most competitive domestic markets.  All sectors are fully exposed to invigorating price competition from both domestic and international competitors.<br />What will it take for Japan to redress their situation? Mr. Katz suggests the following economic reform:<br />1) Resolve the NPLs by making a large capital infusion into the banking system.  This capital infusion would come with the implementation of tough banking regulations including: implementing better accounting disclosure and rigorous classification of bad assets.  These measures would instill a sound  credit culture within the banking industry.<br />2) Cut individual income taxes to boost consumer demand.<br />3) Boost unemployment compensation to allow for the necessary rise in unemployment resulting from the elimination of excess capacity.<br />4) Promote forces of globalization to enhance competition within domestic economy.  Deregulate domestic industries.  Eliminate price collusion.  This would increase the supply side efficiency and also increase real purchasing power of consumers by lowering monopolistic pricing.<br />How likely are the above reforms to occur? Mr. Katz mentions that some of these reforms have been attempted. But, any progressive regulatory step has been associated with two steps backward.  The deregulation of the financial sector in 1999 was too timid.  Since 1999, there has been a rise in ?financial socialism? as government bodies mediate 45% of deposits and 35% of loans.  Thus, competition within the financial sector has actually weakened since 1999.<br />Mr. Katz indicates that political reform has to occur before successful economic reform can take place.  This entails that the LDP will have to split into two parties.  Japan is the only democracy that has been ruled by a single party since 1945.  You need political competition before you can stimulate economic competition.  Mr. Katz believe the LDP will inevitably split up because the LDP can not survive flat economic growth for another decade.c and international competitors. <br />What will it take for Japan to redress their situation?

These public services are used by ethnic minorities whose population has mushroomed in the past thirty years.  These minorities are not represented at the voting polls.  The polls are dominated by the older, wealthier, white voters who strive to reduce their taxes.  The split between the demographic profile of the voters and the users of services is a challenge to California's state finances.<br />Abstract:<br />The main themes:<br />1) Tax revolt;<br />2) Demographic forces behind tax revolt; and<br />3) Anti government Prop movement.<br />Tax Revolt.<br />The California public sector went from being the Nation's envy in the sixties  to becoming among the sorriest in the nineties.  In the sixties, California ranked among the top state in per capita spending on schools, universities, and infrastructure.  Now, California ranks near the bottom on all counts.  This shift was due to the tax revolt started in 1978 by Prop 13.<br />The passage of key propositions caused budget constraints.  Prop 13 in 1978 reduced property taxes by 60%.  It shrank  cities revenues by 27%, counties by 40%, school districts by 46%.  Prop 13 also limited the ability of local governments to raise funds.  Any parcel tax to service new bond issuance to fund local services has to be approved by 2/3 of voters.  Ever since California schools have been underfunded.  The Gann's spending limit, Prop 4, passed in 1979 limited the growth in state and local spending to the % increase in population + inflation.  But, school enrollment and inmate counts were rising faster than the general population.  Prop 13 & 4 resulted in cuts in K-12 spending.  Prop 98 passed in 1988, was to shore up school spending.  It guarantees that K-14 spending be equal to 40% of the General Fund.  But, a decade later school funding as a % of General Fund was lower than it was before Prop 98.  Prop 98 became a cap for school funding.<br />These propositions caused a shift away from direct taxation towards fees.  New fees have been raised on real estate development, business licenses, utility services.  Fees on real estate development represent up to $60,000 per home!  With the passage of Prop 218 in 1996, this access to local revenues was curtailed.  Prop 218 dictates that no local tax, or fee will be imposed without a vote of the affected citizen.<br />Another impact of Prop 13 is the \\"fiscalization of land.\\"  Land zoning became driven towards shopping centers which generate sales tax.  This fiscalization of land resulted in a slow growth of the housing stock.<br />Demographic factors behind Tax Revolt.<br />Demographic shifts have caused a disconnect between voters and the users of public services.  Between the 70s and the 90s, whites decreased from 78% to 52% of the population.  Meanwhile, non-Whites grew from 22% to 48% of the population due to migration from Mexico, Central America, and the Far East.  The non-Whites are the users of public services.  In the K-12, you have a growing multi-ethnic population.  In the community colleges, Latinos dominate.  In the UC system, Asians dominate.  In prisons, Blacks dominate.  Medicaid recipients are mainly Latinos.  These non-Whites users of public services are young, low income, renters.<br />However, 78% of the voters are White.  They are older, high income, homeowners.  Also, parents with children in school decreased from 42% of the electorate in 1977 to only 21% in 1997.  The different profile of voters and public service users is the demographic force fueling the tax revolt.<br />Anti government movement.<br />The Proposition movement has rendered the California government so much harder to run.  Prop 140 in 1990 set term limits at the State level.  Members of the Assembly are limited to three two year terms (six years total).  State senators are limited to two four year terms (eight years total).  Thus, legislators have little experience running a complex State government.  Thus, power has shifted from legislators to bureaucrats and lobbyists not affected by term limits.  Prop 223 passed in 1998 set term limits at the Federal level.  Thus, California congressmen are limited to three to year terms (six years total), and California senators are limited to two six year terms (12 years total).  This puts California at a disadvantage relative to other State regarding allocation of Federal funds.<br />California has increasingly more propositions on its ballots.  And, more of them are deemed unconstitutional, and become stuck in courts.  There is no review process insuring that props are legally sound before they go on ballots.<br />In the early nineties, the Constitution Revision Commission was an effort to render the state constitution functional again.  It made excellent recommendations: extending term limits, eliminating the 2/3 majority to pass local bonds, and increase property tax on businesses.  The legislature dismissed all recommendations.<br />My one rebuttal.<br />The author represents that California's overall tax burden is less than average.  But, I compared the tax structure of the eight States with population greater than 10 millions.  As of 2001, within this group, California had the highest individual income tax rate.  It had the third highest corporate income tax rate and sales tax rate.  It is only in property tax that it ranked below average at 6th among the eight.  If we looked not at tax rates, but instead tax dollars, you'd have to bet that California's property tax would be closer to the top.  This is because California homes are more expensive.

Summary<br />Mr. Zakaria covers two different subjects.  The first is why democracies succeed or fail.  He states that successful democracies are preceded by transition governments (liberal autocracies) during which a strong foundation for future democracy is established.  This foundation includes protection of citizen liberties, including an effective judicial system, and economic reforms leading to capitalism.<br />Mr. Zakaria second theme is how to improve our U.S. democracy.  He feels many aspects of our society have been overly democratized and corrupted.  His solutions is to have more political independent bodies.  Here Zakaria is less convincing, as we have already passed stringent laws to restore the integrity of our capitalist system.<br />This is a very interesting book.  Mr. Zakaria treating of the first subject is exceptional.<br />Abstract<br />Mr. Zakaria develops a sophisticated model which groups governments into four different buckets along two axis (democracy, and liberty).  The four different government types are: a) illiberal autocracy, b) liberal autocracy, c) illiberal democracy, and d) liberal democracy.<br />An illiberal autocracy is a tyranny.  The country is ruled by a tyrant who controls  virtually everything.  Citizens are exploited and do not benefit of any human rights.  Representative elections are out of the question.  Under such a regime, you have no democracy and no liberty.<br />A liberal autocracy is run by a leader or ruling elite.  General Pervez Musharraf of Pakistan is an example.  Most aspects of political life are not democratic.  However, such governments are undergoing a slow but successful transition towards democracy.  The leader or ruling elite supports the necessary foundations for a liberal democracy.  These include civil rights, property rights, a well established judicial system, and economic reforms leading to capitalism.  Here, you don't have much democracy yet, but you have quite a bit of liberty.  Zakaria mentions numerous example of liberal autocracies that are progressing towards liberal democracies.  These include: Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, Malaysia, Chile, and Mexico.<br />An illiberal democracy is just the opposite of a liberal autocracy.  It is synonymous with a failed democracy.  Political leaders are elected democratically.  But, the country lacks the necessary foundation for true democracy.  According to Zakaria 42 of the 48 states in Africa fall in this category.  Other examples include Iran, the Balkans, and Indonesia.  The judicial system is  corrupt.  Individual rights are limited.  The economy is dysfunctional.  You have some  democracy, but not much liberty.  Most inevitably these regimes will revert back to illiberal autocracy.<br />A liberal democracy is a true democracy such as what we have in the West.  Here we have a lot of democracy and liberty.  It is a solid political system marked by free elections, the rule of law, the separation of powers, human rights, including private property, free speech, women's right, and tolerance for religious and ethnic diversity.  The forces that established liberal democracy in the West included: the separation of church and state, the Renaissance, the Enlightenment, the Reformation, capitalism, and the resulting of a wealthy, informed, and independent middle class.<br />Zakaria states that the Middle East currently lacks the necessary foundation to build successful democracies.  There are large segments of the population that are illiterate, illiberal, violent, and extreme.  To hope that liberalism will come by throwing open the democratic process to these elements seems absurd.  The U.S. should not press the Middle East to democratize.  It should instead pressure it to liberalize.  This means reinforcing fair judicial systems, improve on human rights including women's rights, and also support economic reform and open markets through trade agreements.  Liberalizing the economy is the great Trojan horseof political liberalization because regimes are generally willing to do it.  Over time, this creates a powerful middle class that naturally pushes to open up the political system.<br />In Iraq, we have to first establish a constitution with a bill of rights, an independent judiciary, a sound central bank.  Only then, move to a full-fledged democracy.  Young democracies associated with too rapid a transition have a really poor record of handling ethnic and religious conflict.  The former Yugoslavia comes to mind.  Thus, the democratization of Iraq has to be planned to avoid a similar fate.  The electoral system should not create a \\"winner take all\\" system, in which a party that wins 51% of the vote gets all the political power.  Let the losers share in the spoils.  Have both a head of state (a president) who could be a Kurd with a Shiite head of government (a prime minister).  So, different ethnic and religious groups get represented and share the power.<br />Moving on to the domestic domain, Zakaria debates the excessive level of democratization in the U.S.  where democracy has descended into ?a simple-minded populism that values popularity and openness.?  Everything is run by polls and Nielsen ratings sometimes to the detriment of our democracy.  The solution, Zakaria says, is more appointed bodies, like the World Trade Organization and the U.S. Supreme Court, which are effective precisely because they are insulated from political pressures.  Certain institutions like the securities and accounting professions are being corrupted by loosing their independent judgments, and being weakened by economics incentives.  The accounting scandals of the past few years are a testimony to this effect.<br />What he is talking about were \\"conflict of interest\\" which were pervasive throughout our capitalist society.  It is a point well taken, but our society has already dealt with this.  During the past couple of years, new laws have corrected these conflict of interests within corporations, the securities industry, and the accounting industry.rse of political liberalization because regimes are generally willing to do it.

Summary.<br />This is the best book explaining the splitting of the Transatlantic Alliance.  Europe and the U.S. have radically different foreign policy interest and behavior.  Europe is the champion of multilaterism, supranational entities, representing soft power.  The U.S. is the number one power in the World with no rivals.  It has no interest in letting its own hard power being curbed by supranational entities such as the UN and the EU.  Thus, the U.S. is becoming more prone to intervene militarily to fix problems on the international scene.  Meanwhile, Europe is against military intervention at all costs.  Read this book, it gives you an indispensable background to understand current foreign policy developments.<br />Abstract.<br />The author analyses the growing schism within the Transatlantic Alliance.  Formerly, Europe and the U.S. made up the Western block.  Together we fought back Nazism during WWII.  Then, the U.S. with the tacit support of Europe fought back Communism during the Cold War.  We (Europe and U.S.) were deemed to have the same value (democracy, human rights, free trade, capitalism) and the same priorities, including maintaining peace worldwide.<br />Kagan explains how the Western block has split open into two.  Europe and the U.S. have diverging political interests resulting in different behaviors in foreign affairs.  Europe and the U.S. represent the polarized opposite on the multilateral vs. unilateral axis.  Kagan extracted his insight from studying \\"The National Security Strategy of the United States of America,\\" a remarkable document released by the Administration on the Internet in September 2002.<br />From an economic and military standpoint, Europe is a declining power.  Ever since WW II, its economic growth and defense spending has lagged the U.S.  As a result, Europe has little military capability and hard power.  Europe does not have the might or the will to resolve any foreign policy issue through military intervention.  Instead, Europe has become the champion of multilaterism.  First, it practiced multilaterism to achieve an ever increasing level of political and economic integration within its borders since WWII.  Now, it wants to spread multilaterism throughout the World.  Europe is very supportive of all supranational institutions such as the UN and NATO.  This is because it is a mean to extend its own European soft power.  This is a power that expresses itself through Worldwide treaties and agreements, such as the Kyoto Protocol.<br />The U.S. has become the number one power in the World with unmatched economic and military superiority.  This has become obvious since the end of the Cold War.  As a result, the U.S. has a ton of hard power, where Europe has none.  The U.S. foreign policy is much more dynamic and interventionist than Europe.  When the U.S. sees an emerging threat, it wants to fix it, not just talk about it European style.  Since the end of the Cold War, under G. Bush Sr., the U.S. invaded Panama in 1989, lead the Gulf War in 1991, and humanitarian intervention in Somalia in 1992.  Under Clinton, the U.S. conducted military interventions in Haiti, Bosnia, and Kosovo.  Now, under G. Bush Jr, the U.S. has conquered Afghanistan and Iraq, and is running these two countries as protectorates.<br />As we know, the Iraq invasion was opposed by the majority of the UN Security Council.  This seemed shocking at the time.  Kagan thought this was highly expected because of the U.S. relative power position in history.  He indicates that whenever a nation finds itself alone at the top in terms of hard power, it is in no mood to subject its hard power to the soft power generated by supranational institutions.  He mentions numerous examples of the past, namely Europe 200 years ago, when France and England were wielding their respective hard power, and the much weaker U.S. was begging for them to recognize our soft power.  But, in 200 years, we have completely traded places.<br />So, according to Kagan, we can expect to see the U.S. to go at it alone more frequently unilaterally.  The U.S. may routinely send the UN and EU packing on various policy issues.  The U.S. has no interest in cooperation in anything that will curb its supremacy.  Thus, it is opposed to supranational entities that hinder its supremacy.  Europe has just the opposite interest.  It loves supranational bodies, as it views them as the best way to curb U.S. superiority.<br />In the future, can the U.S. go at it alone? And, police the World without the support of Europe?  Will it suffer from imperial overstretch?  Kagan answers that the U.S. is already policing the World on its own now, and has no need for European support.  The U.S. with an increasingly efficient and technologically advanced military can go a long way with a huge military budget approaching $500 billion.  Yet, it represents less than 4% of GDP.  This is a lot lower than the 7% of GDP the US spent on defense during the Reagan years.  Thus, the U.S. is not overstretched by any means.cording to Kagan, we can expect to see the U.S. to go at it alone more frequently unilaterally.

It reviews fundamental analysis, technical analysis, option theory and other topics. The author explains well the Efficient Market Hypothesis, behavioral finance, chaos theory, and power laws.  And, he did all that in 200 pages, meanwhile spending pages sharing his self depreciating humorous narrative on his disastrous investment in WorldCom.    As a mathematician having studied the stock market, he believes the stock market is pretty efficient; and that technical analysis is of no value. He gives slightly more credit to fundamental analysis.  His internal debate on the Efficient Market Hypothesis is a fascinating part of the book.     Technical analysis should be renamed trend analysis, as it consists in extrapolating current stock price trends. He covers the major strategies technical analysts use such as buying stocks when their current price breaks through its moving average, and selling them when they fall under this same moving average.    He covers fundamental analysis in details including all the usual metrics such as P/E, PEG, P/Book value, P/Sales. He also mentions Robert Shiller's work on \\"Market Volatility\\" that questions both the Efficient Market Hypothesis and fundamental analysis. Shiller noticed that stock prices are more volatile than the underlying fundamentals of their respective companies. For Shiller, the stock market is irrational.     Mr. Paulos makes a case that the stock market captures the aggregate of all our psychological foibles, and goes on giving a good intro to behavioral finance. He illustrates the common psychological flaws associated with investor behavior, including: confirmation bias, anchoring effect, status quo bias, endowment effect, and Richard Thaler's mental accounts. He also illustrates flaws we incur when doing investment research, such as: data mining back testing, and the survivor bias. But, in aggregate these human errors partly cancel themselves out rendering the stock market pretty efficient.    The book's gem is the debate on the Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH). The fewer the investors believe in EMH, the more they will engage in technical and fundamental analysis to extract excess return above the index. These \\"active\\" investors will render the market more efficient, and negate their opportunities to earn excess return. The opposite is also true. If investors believe in EMH, they will become \\"passive\\" and just invest in a stock index. As a result, the market will not be so efficient, and the EMH will not hold up in such a situation. So if you believe in EMH, it is false. But, if you don't believe in it, it is valid.    Paulos argues that enough active investors do not believe in the EMH to render it valid. This argument is convincing when you think of the thousands of equity mutual funds, closed end funds, hedge funds, and private managers on Wall Street. Thus, there is plenty of professional investors to render the market efficient. But, Paulos does not deny that certain markets at times may be less than efficient. Thus, the EMH debate is not just a true or false question, it is a matter of degree.    Active investors play a crucial role in making the market efficient. Paulos makes a distinction between the technical analyst and fundamental analyst. He states that technical analysts are momentum investors.  They cause market volatility to increase. When stock prices increase, these guys buy even more. When stock prices decrease, they sell. Thus, they accentuate the swings in stock movements. Notice that they break the rule of \\"Buy Low Sell High.\\" The fundamental analysts are really value investors. They do just the opposite and cause stock price movements to moderate. Thus, the two types of investors play a different role. But, together their active analysis make the stock market very efficient. The EMH states that all information is disseminated and absorbed immediately within the investment community, and thus is fully reflected within stock prices. But, somebody has to process this information. And, that is what the technical and fundamental analysts do. This is how these active investors who are EMH skeptics are its actual underpinning.     One of Paulos other big concept concerns the statistical distribution of stock price movements. According to the EMH, stock price movements are random. And, this is true as confirmed by the autocorrelation on any time series of stock prices that is very close to zero. But, they do not move following a normal distribution.  In other words, extreme events (stock crashes or booms) happen more frequently than in a normal distribution. He adds that at the tails, the price movement of stocks is better captured by the power laws. Check page 178 for a detailed explanation on power laws. This is fascinating, and it may represent an upgrade to the EMH that relies solely on the normal distribution.	2003-06-19

It can lead to paying far too much to purchase an option.  It would be like buying a stock without knowing its P/E, or buying a car without knowing its blue book value.  The way to avoid this mistake is by carefully analyzing which options are best suited to achieve your objective.  Also, measure what is the current implied volatility of these options and compare it vs. the historical volatility of this option.  This will give you an idea of the current valuation of this option, and whether it appears overpriced or underpriced.<br />Buying only out-of-the-money options.<br />By doing so, you ignore the probability that the option will eventually be in-the-money.  It leads to buying options with little likelihood of profiting.  You can get lucky once.  But, such a blind strategy is a sure way to get wiped out in option trading.  Instead, you should know exactly what is the probability of you making money on each option trades.  This entails knowing the \\"Delta\\" of a specific option.  If an option has a Delta of 20.  It has a 20% chance of being in-the-money.<br />Using strategies that are too complex.<br />This leads to unfavorable risk\reward situations.  First, you should determine your objective and make certain the trade you are going to make can achieve those objectives without more risk than you can handle.<br />Casting too wide a net.<br />You will spend too much time wasted looking for opportunities among illiquid options.  By doing so, you will waste a lot of your potential returns on the wider bid and ask spreads of these less than liquid options.  Instead, focus on securities that have actively traded options.<br />This book is a real eye opener on option trading.r />This book is a real eye opener on option trading.	2003-06-19

The likelihood of any being ever implemented is low.  Thus, this book is not the best use of a reader's time.  You are better off reading Shiller two earlier excellent books: Market Volatility, and Irrational Exuberance.<br />Abstract.<br />Shiller develops economic concepts to reduce important risks within our society.  These include:<br />1) Livelihood insurance against poor career choices.<br />2) Home value insurance.<br />3) Income-linked loans for reducing the risk of hardship and bankruptcy.<br />4) Inequality insurance.  Protecting the distribution of income.<br />5) Intergenerational Social Security: Sharing risks between Young and Old.<br />6) International Agreements for Risk Control.<br />Below I will briefly evaluate these concepts.<br />Livelihood insurance.<br />Workers could get coverage against the decline in income that workers in the same field have experienced.  The decline in income for the workers in this specific field would be measured whether the worker has remained in this given field or not.  Take a cohort of 100 professional violinists.  If 50 exit the field, and make their living as bartenders, this cohort of 100 violinists income would really reflect the income of 50 professional violinists and 50 bartenders.  By the end, what would this income index really tell you?  Shiller underestimates the liquidity of our labor markets.  Today, you can find as many astrophysicists in consulting firms, and investment banking.  The same is true for engineers.  Many engineers end up as consultants in fields often not directly related to engineering, instead of working for engineering firms.<br />Home value insurance.<br />Homeowners could buy insurance against the value of their homes.  So, if the value of their homes went down, they would receive payments from the insurer.  This product runs into two hurdles.  First, if priced correctly, this product would be very expensive.  Few homeowners would be willing to pay per year the several percentage points on the value of their homes to insure them against a decline in value of their homes for just a 12 month period.  It is essentially the price of a Put option on the value of your home.  Secondly, the brunt of this risk is not born by homeowners but by creditors.  To conclude, this insurance product would be expensive to cover a risk that is mainly born by another party (creditors).<br />Income linked loans.<br />Borrowers would repay loans as a fixed percentage of their income.  So, if their income goes down, the debt burden goes down, and vice versa.  This product will never reach a critical mass because it is unworkable for banks.  Banks try to match the cash flows from their assets with the ones from their liabilities.  An income linked loan would have such an unpredictable cash flow that it could not be matched by any bank liabilities cash flow.  You figure the deposits and bonds issued from banks are not income linked.  As a bank depositor or a bondholder, you demand a very predictable cash flow stream, not one dependent on the income of the bank?s borrowers.  Thus, I don't see income linked loans becoming part of \\"The New Financial Order.\\"<br />Inequality insurance, protecting the distribution of income.<br />Here the tax structure would be automatically adjusted to maintain a predicated distribution of income.  This would have horrendous implications for financial planning.  You would be uncertain as to your ultimate tax burden at the end of the year when the distribution of income would be recalculated.<br />Intergenerational Social Security: Sharing risks between Young and Old.<br />This product would overhaul the structure of Social Security.  Now, the Social Security system is structured as a pension system.  Currently, social security contributions far exceed the payments.  This is to build up the Social Security trust fund for when the large Baby Boomer generation retires, when payments will far exceed contributions.  With Shiller, the income earned by active workers would be shared on a prorated basis with retirees.  He states that currently retirees represent 11% of the population.  So, the workers contribution would be 11% of their wages to support the retirees.  But, this percentage will double in just a few decades.  So, the 11% contribution will become 22%.  This is unfair to the next generation.  The current system of prefunding the social security trust to get set for higher social security payments in the future is better.  It equalizes the burden of supporting retirees between current workers and their next generation.  Shiller concept does the reverse.<br /><br />International Agreements for Risk Control.<br />Countries would enter agreements that would hedge against their economies under performing in the future.  So, let's say that India's GDP is expected to increase by 4% per year over the next 10 years.  India would enter into a contract with a group of countries (U.S., UK, Germany, etc.).  The group of countries would make a payment to India anytime India's GDP would grow by less than 4%.  But, India would have to make very large payments to the group of countries whenever its GDP rose by more than 4% per year.  It is unclear how India would come up with that extra money.  Would it have to raise taxes on its citizen?  The resulting counterparty risk associated with India making such payments would be unmanageable.n retires, when payments will far exceed contributions.

Fire your broker!	Summary:<br />This is a great book on investment theory.  It covers the Efficient Market Theory, Arbitrage Pricing Theory, Capital Asset Pricing Model, Beta, Portfolio Theory.  It also explains really well how Wall Street operates and values stock.  It explains the two main valuation tools used by the pros: fundamental analysis and technical analysis.  It also suggests that since investment pros can't beat the stock indexes, you are much better off investing in an index fund.<br />Abstract:<br />This is an investment classic expanding on the merits of a couple of investment theories.  One is the Efficient Market Theory whereby all information about a stock is efficiently disseminated among investors.  As a result, stock prices already capture all relevant information.  And, there are no unexploited gains to be had from any additional information regarding a specific stock.  The second one is the Arbitrage Pricing Theory.  This is the one illustrated by the metaphor: Have you picked up a $100 bill on the ground lately?  Most, probably not!?  In other words, there are typically no arbitrage opportunities in the stock market.  Any small discrepancies in prices between various stocks and securities get arbitraged out almost immediately.  To reinforce the metaphor, you may pick a couple of pennies on the ground (very small arbitrage opportunities), but certainly not large dollar bills (larger arbitrage opportunities).<br />These two theories reinforce the fact that stock prices move following a random pattern.  Since all information is captured by investors, and investors immediately arbitrage out any infinitesimally small investment gains between themselves, you have no way of knowing where stock prices will go.  Mathematically, the way to confirm this is to measure the auto correlation of the prices of a stock.  In other words, you measure the correlation of a set of stock prices over time, with the same time series but using a one period lag (could be one day, one week, or anything you want).  In all cases, the calculated correlation coefficient will be close to zero.  This does mean that stock prices do move randomly.  And, that knowing today?s stock prices does not give you any predictive information regarding tomorrow stock prices.  Stock prices may go up or down.  You may as well flip a coin.<br />In view of the above theoretical foundation, the author goes on debunking very successfully the two stock valuation models used by the investment pros:<br />1) Fundamental analysis; and<br />2) Technical analysis.<br />Fundamental analysis is used by security analysts.  They come up with a projected earnings figure for the stock and divide it by the difference between the estimated required rate of return for that stock and the estimated earnings growth rate.  The formula's result will equal the value for this stock.  This value divided by the earnings per share will get you the Price/Earnings ratio on prospective earnings over the next 12 months.  So far it sounds rational.  Where this methodology gets tricky is that small changes in the required rate of return or the estimated earnings growth rate result in huge valuation fluctuations.  And, there is no certain way to get these assumptions right (required rate of return and estimated growth rate).  Another similar method, is to use a discounted cash flow model, and forecast dividends, and capital gains over a specific holding period.  You then discount this cash flow stream.  The resulting present value is the value of the stock.  But, here again what is the proper discount rate to use in valuing that stock?  The Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) may help out arrive at that discount rate.  But, nothing is fool proof.  And, a small difference in discount rate makes a huge difference in present value.  Although, these methods (fundamental analysis) are well respected by investment pros, investors, and the financial press; as described we can see how they are less than perfect.  Aswe will soon see, they are still the best we?ve got within the field of active management.<br />Technical analysis, the second valuation method, consists in observing the trend of stock prices over time on a graph, and capturing different moving averages (50 day and 200 day moving averages are most common).  Depending if the current stock prices is breaking above or below their respective moving average curves give you either a buy or sell signal.  If you see it visually on a graph, this method is seductive.  Unfortunately, it is complete bunk.  Remember stock prices move randomly.  Their auto correlation is zero.  This is a statistical fact.  Thus, it is less than surprising that technical analysis does not hold the same credibility as fundamental analysis within the investment community.  Thus, if the author considered fundamental analysis less than perfect; he rightfully considers technical analysis completely flawed.<br />As you can imagine this book is not popular with investment professionals, including brokers who are trying to sell you specific stocks.  The debates regarding the Efficient Market Theory and Arbitrage Pricing Theory are raging.  And, they always will.  Invariably, you will find a group of investment experts who will refute these theories.  But, if the market is not efficient, it is extremely tough to exploit these inefficiencies on a sustainable basis.  Just ask the Nobel Prize winners in investment theory who were the former directors of Long Term Capital Management which turned into Short Term Capital Destruction.<br />So, what is an investor to do if pros can't beat the average return as represented by indexes.  It is simple, just invest in the index yourself through an index fund.  Over time, you will beat a majority of the pros (a lot more than just the average suggests).  This is because the pros returns are dragged by operating costs, trading costs, and taxes on short term gains.will soon see, they are still the best we?ve got within the field of active management.<br />Technical analysis, the second valuation method, consists in observing the trend of stock prices over time on a graph, and capturing different moving averages (50 day and 200 day moving averages are most common).

I really enjoyed the movie, but I did not believe any of it.  How could a 16 year old pull off all these scams posing successfully as an airline pilot, lawyer, doctor, and FBI agent.  Only in Hollywood!  I had to read the book to uncover the truth.  To my amazement, almost nothing in the movie was dramatized.  Frank Abagnale did it all.  And, this even includes the acrobatic escape from a commercial plane as it lands.<br /><br />The book depicts a far richer story than the movie.  At the start, the family situation is more complex.  The scams are more intricate.  The career path is more extraordinary.  The movie skipped over interesting jobs, including a stint as a college sociology teacher.<br /><br />Also amazing is that this teenager acquired far more knowledge about the meaning of every single digit on a personal check than any banker I know.  And, I know, having been engaged in banking and finance for over two decades.<br /><br />Frank's character development make the whole story more likely.  Frank was not your regular 16 year old dude.  At 16, he could easily pass for a fit 25 year old.  He was 6 feet tall, 170 pounds.  He also acquired quite a real world education by hanging out with his Dad.  His Dad exposed him to political, business, and social circles that teenagers do not know.  Thus, Frank Abagnale, being a keen observer, learned quickly how adults behave among themselves.<br /><br />Frank was also strikingly handsome, and confident.  So, the story includes many romantic interludes.  This aspect of life is described most tastefully.  There is nothing graphic here.  And, it does not detract from the story.  To the contrary, women were a key element in this scammer's education.  They were often insiders to the professions he attempted to fake.<br /><br />There are a lot of close calls, where you feel Abagnale's cover is going to peel off for good.  But, invariably he recovers elegantly from what appears like desperate situations.<br /><br />In the last part of the book things finally go south.  But, it is still fascinating.

It is also about sports, lifestyle, spirituality, attitude, family and community support.  The Okinawans do everything we do not.  They accept aging and death naturally.  As a result, they are scared of neither, and age incredibly gracefully.  Their lifespan is a lot longer than ours.  And, they typically remain fully capable and active until they pass away.  All their life signs remain much healthier and vibrant than ours through old age.  This is regardless of the indicator you choose.  Their respective cholesterol levels, blood pressure, gender hormone levels (testosterone for male, estrogen for female), muscle mass, BMI index are all much better than Americans.  They achieve this with no prescription drugs, few supplements if at all, fewer doctors visits, including far fewer surgical interventions.  When you are healthy and stay that way you don't need that much medical support.<br />As described above, The Okinawa Program is the best way to reduce our rampant U.S. healthcare cost.  But, it also may be the most unrealistic, because it relies on self discipline and spirituality.

The author states that studying this book is like taking a college level class in biochemistry.  And, it is true.  Because the material is presented in such a fun anecdotal style, you don't even realize you are learning rather dry technical stuff.

He explains how these interact with each other and our own metabolism to provide the necessary healthy fuel we need.<br />He goes on describing the worst diet in the World.  Some of us may be horrified, as it describes a very average American diet that some of us have to eat (otherwise it would not be the average American diet).  This includes plenty of very convenient, tasty, processed foods that have their share of saturated fats, partially hydrogenated oils, and few nutritive calories of any kind.  In any case, this is a pretty healthy wake up call for some of us.  The author indicates what this diet leads to if maintained over a life time.  This includes a far greater incidence of cardiovascular diseases and greater risk of numerous cancers.<br />The author also covers what are the various diets that could qualify as the best in the World.  There is no great surprise there.  Such diets are rich in fresh produce (fruits and vegetables), avoid most processed foods, sugar, excessive salt, and saturated fats.  They can run from Asian to Mediterranean style(s) with a wide variety in between.  So, there are plenty of healthy and delicious ways to eat.	2003-06-11

Summary:<br />The author develops an interesting framework on how humans interpret and extrapolate risk.  By reading this book, you will better understand where people are coming from, and how they support their claims regarding environmental risk and other uncertain risks.<br />Abstract:<br />This is a very interesting book on how we perceive and interpret risk.  According to the author, the study of risk includes a critical \\"behavioral\\" component that is absent from most risk management framework.  Below are three main concepts, I learned from this book.<br />1) A behavioral risk management model;<br />2) Three different risk temperaments;<br />3) Extrapolation methodologies in alternative dose-response.<br />A behavioral risk management model.<br />The author develops an interesting behavioral risk management model.  According to this model, we have a certain propensity to take risk that is balanced by our perception of danger.  From these two inputs, you get two outcomes:<br />1) accidents (the risk you took materialized), or<br />2) rewards (the risk you took was worth it, and you enjoyed your undertaking without crashing).<br />Where this model gets creative is that as our perception of risk changes, our propensity to take this risk will change in the opposite direction.  He calls this a \\"balancing behavior.\\"  For instance, he analyzes mortality rates before and after a mandatory car seatbelt law was implemented in England.  He comes up with the counter intuitive conclusion that the seatbelt law did not save any lives overall.  It simply transferred some mortality risk from car drivers to bikers, and pedestrians.  According to his model, car drivers feeling safer (lower perceived danger) now drove faster with their seatbelt on.  Fewer car drivers died, because they survived accidents more frequently.  But, more bikers and pedestrians died hit by cars more frequently than before the seatbelt law was implemented.<br />Three different risk temperaments.<br />The Individualist.  Individualists are enterprising \\"self-made\\" people relatively free from controls by others, who strive to exert control over their environment and the people in it.  Nature is bountiful, robust, stable, and forgiving of any insults humankind might inflict upon it.  This temperament often represents \\"industry\\" on environmental debates.  Industry will often underestimate environmental deterioration due to itself, and fight any related regulation that would curb its activities.  Industry will often overestimate the negative economic impact of proposed regulations.<br />The Egalitarian.  Egalitarians are the opposite of the Individualists.  They are environmentalists.  Nature is fragile, precarious, and unforgiving.  It is in danger of being provoked by human greed or carelessness into catastrophic collapse.  They often dramatize potential environmental impact.  And, they favor government regulation to curb any industrial activities without any consideration for the associated economic impact.<br />The Hierarchist.  These have a balanced approach between the Individualist and the Egalitarian, or between the Industrialist and the Environmentalist.  In other words, they believe that nature is resilient up to a certain threshold of environmental stress (i.e., concentration of CO2 in the ozone); but beyond this threshold, they believe that nature can be permanently impaired just like the environmentalist.  Many in government and within the scientific community belong to this group.<br />Extrapolation methodologies in alternative dose-response.<br />This relates to the method of extrapolating the toxicity of certain chemicals on humans from animal studies.  There are four different methods: a) Supralinear, b) Linear, c) Sublinear, and d) Threshold.<br />Supralinear models assume that the level of risk will remain high as dose levels are reduced.<br />Linear models assume that there is a direct relationship between dose and risk.  Reducing the dose by half will also reduce the risk or the impact by half.<br />Sublinear models assume that reducing the dose by half will reduce the risk or impact by more than half.<br />Threshold models assume that risk falls to zero when the dose levels fall below a certain value, the threshold dose.<br />None of the above model is either right or wrong.  They are just assumptions to simulate how risk changes with chemical dosage in the real world.

Therefore, the emission of the same chemical does not need to be regulated.<br />The Hierarchist often Scientist may gravitate to a more balanced model like the Linear one.

This is a very original book how luck pervades our lives, more specifically our financial one.  And, how we misinterpret luck for knowledge or expertise when our investments go up, and blame extremely rare `Perfect Storm' type circumstances when our investments go down.<br />In reality, most of us don't have much knowledge and expertise (this includes the majority of trading professionals too according to the author).  And, sooner or later we run out of luck.  The author gives this process an interesting mathematical term: Ergodicity.  This means that bad trades eventually catch up with you, even if they seem to generate very profitable outcomes in the short run.<br />In the middle of the book, the author defines the characteristics of bad traders:<br />1. An overestimation of the accuracy of their beliefs in some measure, either economic, or statistical.<br />2. A tendency to get married to positions.<br />3. The tendency to change their story, such as becoming investors \\"for the long haul\\" when they are losing money.<br />4. No precise game plan ahead of time as to what to do in the event of losses.<br />5. Absence of critical thinking expressed in absence of revision of their stance with \\"stop losses.\\"  Traders do not like to sell when their loosing positions represent an \\"even better value.\\"<br />6. Denial.<br />The book is rich in many other insights on investment, trading, and probabilities.  If you are interested in such matters, you will enjoy and learn much from this book.	2003-06-02

Summary:<br />This is an amazing book. Written in 1996, this book is the expansion of a famous article written in Foreign Affairs in 1993. The political model developed in this book explains the events leading to 9/11 far better than most books written after 9/11. Call it prophecy, call it genius. Call it what you will, but read it.<br />Abstract:<br />This book does far more than explain the tension between Islam and the West. It also perfectly explains he ethnic cleansing and implosion of Yugoslavia (Serbia, Croatia, Bosnia), the tension between China and the West on human rights, labor rights, environmental standards, and trade; and why Turkey may never belong to the European Community no matter how much it tries to align itself with the West.<br />The author divides the world in five major cultural blocks: West, Orthodox Russia, Hindu/India, Islam, and Sinic China. Out of these five blocks, you get nine different relationships (West-Islam, Sinic China-Hindu India, etc.). The author studies each relationship in detail, and shows with much historical evidence how many of these relationships are conflictual.<br />After studying data, Samuel Huntington realizes that the West as a whole is experiencing a decline. He measures this decline among several dimentions. English speaking is less predominant now than it was in the fifties as a % of the World population. The same is true of Christianity that is on the decline, while Islam is on a rapid incline. Also, the West represents a far lower share of World GDP then it did in the fifties.<br />The decline of the West does not mean the specific decline of the U.S. But, more the decline of the entire West (when including the entire European Community).<br />Samuel Huntington described two major challenges to the West. These are:<br />1) The Islamic Resurgence; and<br />2) The Asian Affirmation.<br />The Islamic Resurgence entails a rapid population growth throughout the Arab world. This demographic force is a destabilizing element for both Muslim societies and neighbors of these Muslim societies. This demographic force is causing a youth bulge of disaffected, unemployed, frustrated young males who represent a fertile recruiting ground for terrorist groups. Samuel Huntington uses this \\"youth bulge\\" as a benchmark of country risk. If you look at what percent of the population is between 18 and 30 years old, Muslim and unemployed, you can estimate the level of conflicts within and outside a country a specific nation will endure.  This is the type of incisive analytical observation that has made Samuel Huntington  controversial, yet so prescient.<br />The Asian Affirmation refers to the rapid economic development of the Far East and China. As these countries economic might catches up to the West, they are becoming more confident to assert their views in international affairs. They also view their version of capitalism as superior to the West. They also view their own society as much superior to the West on moral grounds. Their values are focused on thrift, family, and discipline. They reject the West focus on individualism, and greed. They sneer at the West weakening family structure. Thus, Samuel Huntington suggests that China, because of its self perceived moral superiority, will be increasingly resistant to concede to the West regarding human rights, labor rights, and environmental standards.<br />Samuel Hunting acknowledges that a model can't explain everything, and is invariably proven wrong on specific details. But, he sets what are the objectives of a good model. His advise rings true regardless of the discipline. In his view, a good model achieves the following:<br />1) Captures reality at the general level;<br />2) Understands causal relationships among phenomena;<br />3) Anticipates future developments;<br />4) Distinguishes between the important and the unimportant; and<br />5) Shows us what paths we should take to achieve our goals.<br />After reading his book, many have concluded that his \\"Clash of Civilizations\\" model has been very successful in capturing the international political developments of the past decade. In this regard, Samuel Huntington's model has been more successful than most.\\"Clash of Civilizations\\" model has been very successful in capturing the international political developments of the past decade. In this regard, Samuel Huntington's model has been more successful than most.	2003-06-01

This is an excellent book on the subject.  It is the most readable and user friendly book on the market on Real Options.

They then illustrate how this model can be applied to non option business investment opportunities.  The authors establish a real option framework to handle your business decision.  It explores many practical cases in detail, so you get a good feeling for this approach.

It shed some light on the limitation of optometry.  But, it replaces with a lot of alternative advice that is inaccurate.<br /><br />First, he comes up with a strange psychological theory that would explain why people's eyesight deteriorated by either becoming myopic or far-sighted.  If you became myopic, it is because you became scared of the outside world through a life changing event that you did not cope well.  Thus, you are refusing to look at the outside world, because you are afraid of it.  If you became presbyopic, you did it because you became angry at the world through another life changing experience you did not digest well.  So, you just had it with the world, and you refuse to look at any of its details close at hand.  This is all bogus.<br /><br />The author also did many experiment that I tried to duplicate myself, but never could.  He takes a bunch of people who are really myopic and orders them to take off their glasses , and then measures their visual prescription twice within the next 24 hours.  I did that, using the testing devise he offers to measure your improvement in vision.  Mine did not budge, yours will not either.<br /><br />In a nutshell, you can't just take off your glasses and see.  This is giving you false hope.<br /><br />So, why am I giving it a 3.  Well, here are some positive valuable information I got out of it:<br />1) Be skeptical of your optometrist measurement of your own prescription.  It is not as accurate as you think;<br />2) I have learned to live with \\"under prescribed\\" glasses.  I now use a prescription that is weaker than one I had 11 years ago.  And, I wear these 90% of the time I am wearing glasses;<br />3) I have learned to actually not wear any glasses when I don't need to.  I probably do that 10% to 20%, when I am home eating a meal with my family.<br /><br />By doing points 2) and 3) as described above, I maintain my vision at its current level, and control the speed at which myopia would accelerate for someone my age.  I watch my colleagues at work rushing to get a new prescription every single year or so.  And, that is nuts.  If we all did that, we would end up with glasses as thick as wine bottle bottoms within 5 years.  If you are doing that, stop it right now.  This book will give you the confidence to stop this vicious cycle.atch my colleagues at work rushing to get a new prescription every single year or so.  And, that is nuts.

Why would we replace a scientific method that is based on exploring rational cause and effect, developing powerful and brilliant equations (law of gravity, and theory of relativity come to mind) that very efficiently capture the essence of our universe with cellular automata.<br />There is no question that cellular automata are very intriguing.  That you can use them to apparently duplicate many natural phenomena in nature that appear completely random.  But, will we be able to predict earthquakes, the movement of stock markets, I don't think so.<br />In other words, can you really think of a realistic valuable practical application for cellular automata.

Reich explains very well all the economic trends that make our society increasingly consumer friendly.  Thanks to competition you can get more products and services at a cheaper price than you ever could.  The dark side of this 24/7 consumer society, is that it is also a ruthless 24/7 workaholic society.  The U.S. is a wonderful place to be rich (ideally financially independent).  But, it is an increasingly competitive place to make a living.  In other words, the U.S. is a consumer's paradise, but often a supplier's hell.<br />Reich develops great metaphors to describe working people in few words.  One of them is the Geeks and the Shrinks.  The Geeks are the ones who know how to gather and manipulate data so as to develop new products and services.  The Shrinks are the ones who research and understand what consumers really want through market research, focus groups, and other tools.  The Geeks and Shrinks are like the Yin and Yang of this new business world.  They both need each other to create new markets of products and services.	2003-05-31

Paul Kennedy has developed a unique approach at explaining history. Paul Kennedy's historical model focuses on a few variables, including:<br />1) What % of GDP a Power dedicates to defense spending in order to maintain its empire;<br />2) What tax burden as % of GDP does that Power need to raise in order to maintain the defense spending level required;<br />3) How much leeway does that Power has in increasing its tax burden on its citizen;<br />4) How willing are the citizen to incur the level of tax burden required to maintain the necessary defense spending level.<br />Using these four variables, Paul Kennedy takes us on a fascinating tour of World history. He can explain a whole lot using his model, including the rise and fall of the Roman Empire, of Napoleon, the British Empire, among many others.<br />The current deteriorating U.S. fiscal position with rising budget deficits, due to a defense spending boom smacks of the imperial overstretch that P. Kennedy analysed in the later stage of several now defunct empires.<br />We are now reliving the Reagan years with Bush Jr. who is using the exact same formula (spend more on defense, cut taxes, let budget deficit baloon, and borrow).  The Reagan years turned out OK with a booming economy and stock market.  But, reading this book will give you a vision on an alternative scenario.

This is an excellent book. The nine strategies make perfect sense. They are innovative, and will work for you. This is how to apply all your intelligences within the workplace and not just your IQ. You will recognize the ones who apply these strategies. They are the ones who may not have MBAs from Harvard, but yet are well liked and respected and go up the corporate ladder seemingly effortlessly.<br />The author strategies are also quite original.  He stresses how strong \\"followership\\" is just as important if not more as \\"leadership.\\"  This is a really important point that is rarely mentioned in management seminars.<br />If you are a Harvard MBA, good for you. Nevertheless, this book will be invaluable to your success as it will give you the strategies and people skills you may need to truly leverage the superior business education you got.	2003-05-30

His book actually walks you letter by letter into understanding the full equation of the theory of relativity.  As we all know, the equation is short, but the ramifications behind each of the letters are rather intense.  Actually, I have read some place that this equation is the most encompassing with Newton's law of gravity.  They are both short and apparently simple equations, yet they do a good job of explaining powerful and pervasise laws that apply throughout our universe, and do a good deal of explaining it.<br />Another characteristic of this book, is the excellent personality development of all the luminaries throughout history whose incremental knowledge lead to Einstein's development of his theories.  After reading this, you realise that Einstein's ideas, although extraordinary, did not emerge in vacuum.  His predecessors had developed the major building blocks.  It took Einstein genius to assemble the blocks together.	2003-05-30

This is a unique and valuable bible of the current state of healing arts.  The author has no political agenda.  He does not favor 'alternative' vs 'Western' or 'traditional' medicine.  He just objectively tells you what works and what does not work so well given specific health condition.<br />He allows you to attack any ailment you have with a multi-medicinal approach.  For any given condition, this book makes insightful recommendation from ayuverdic, homeopathic, herbal, and traditional medicine.<br />It is unfortunate that within the medical establishment (the AMA) this 'Blended' approach has not taken hold.  It is obviously much more successful than going at it from one limited perspective.<br />Thanks to this book though, it is like having your own in house doctor.	2003-05-30

But, few understand themselves to begin with.  Know thyself!  These two words are full of so much mystery.  If you want to crack the code of your own psychological DNA, this book is a great start.<br />It is a great interpretation and practical application of the Myers Briggs test and psychological theory.  The test in the book is as accurate and detailed as any test you can take online.  What is good about taking the manual test, is that it really improves your understanding on why you scored the way you did on each of the different four psychological axis. When you take a test online, it typically spits out a result, but you don't get to review the underlying data that you just inputted.<br />This book can save you thousands of dollars in expensive psychological testing,and psycho analysis.	2003-05-30

It helped me a lot recognizing my psychological profile, my role in life, and how to treat and respect myself so as to function optimally in this rather challenging world of ours.<br />The author comes up with wonderful metaphors.  She places people in two broad buckets.  First, the King Warriors, these are the majority of the people accounting for roughly 80% of the population.  They are self assured, often loud, and thrive naturally in our macho world.  They are also risk takers.  And, allow our society to advance in all sorts of discipline.  So, as you can see, even though they may have some less than desireable qualities, they also make a very positive contribution to society.  The other 20% are the Highly Sensitive Person (HSP).  She calls them the King Advisors.  These people are not so self assured.  They are typically not risk takers.  But, their complex sensitive personalities give them a multi dimension ability to understand the world around them.  Thus, they are a source of judgment, wisdom, knowledge that is indispensable for society at large.  Thanks to them, the energy and risk daring of the King Warriors can be better optimized.  In other workds, society really needs both temperaments (King Warriors and King Advisors) to be fruitful and progress.<br />The author comes up with many other psycho analytical metaphors that you will love.  She also comes with recommendation on how HSPs should deal with doctors, workplace, and other occasional intense situations.  It is full of sound recommendation that will really feel right on the money if you are truly an HSP.	2003-05-30

Paul Krugman is a world class economist.  He foresees and understands economic trends better than most.  His explanation of fiscal policies, international trade, and macroeconomic concepts are entertaining and clear.<br />Unfortunately, nothing he foresees comes true.  In this book, he makes a case that because of recurring budget deficits causing a decline in our national savings rate, our investment rate will drop.  This will cause a decline in productivity, and a resulting decline in the growth of our economy (GDP) and our living standard (GDP per capita).  Thus, this will result in &quot;The Age of Diminished Expectations.&quot;<br />The rest is history as they say.  The nineties did not turn out the way Paul Krugman envisioned them.  The economy increased rapidly, and so did living standards.  He did not foresee the huge net foreign investments that bridged the gap between our low domestic savings rate and our high investment rate.<br />Well, nobody is perfect.  Economic forecasting is challenging at best.  Overall, it is still a very interesting and informative book.  Everything he said in it will eventually be true, it is just a matter of when.  But, it certainly was not true during the nineties which was his timeframe target at the time he wrote the book.	2003-05-30

Each intelligence is very well defined.  Especially fun are all the suggestions on how to develop these aspects of your own intelligence(s).<br />Somehow the concept of 'multiple intelligences' developed by Howard Gardner has not been as successful as the one of 'emotional intelligence' developed by David Coleman.

Top performers in any field appear blessed by a destiny leading them to superior achievement and level of happiness.<br />To the author there is no secret.  All these super talented achievers live in 'flow.'  This is a psychological state where you are so fulfilled that you seem in a timeless, efortless dimention of play.  But, to the rest of the world you actually are really focused, training really hard, and really driven.

I was looking for a book to upgrade my skill level.  I browsed for hours if not days in bookstores in the hope of finding a Chess book I could actually read.  You will note that Chess books are written in a strange cryptic language that make the Greek used in PhD level math look like kindergarden blocks by comparison.  Finally, after a lot of research I came accross Chess for Dummies.<br />This is the Chess book you can actually understand, and quickly learn from.  You improve your skills by learning a key set of strategies that apply at all levels of the game.  Unlike other books, you don't need to memorize the 100 most famous Russian Chess matches before you can play descent Chess.<br />This book took me as far as I cared to go.  I found myself playing descent Chess in rather competitive environments such as the most advanced rooms of online Chess websites, and playing blitzkrieg Chess in public plazas reserved almost exclusively for Chess geeks.<br />I have since quit Chess.  But, I am sure I will pick up the game again.  When I do, I will certainly review the Chess for Dummies.	2003-05-30

Somehow, this book is really not that convincing.  Marc Reisner's arguments seem a lot weaker than in Cadillac Desert.

You will find that there are several types of HSPs with different levels of sensitivity depending on the life domain.

The author takes gutsy stands. He considers the \\"Left brain Right brain\\" concept obsolete. According to his research, the mind's skill set is a lot more fluid than that. Everything the left brain can do, the right brain can do to, and vice versa.<br />His theory focuses on two main thinking modes:<br />1) intellect (d-mode); and<br />2) intuition (undermind).<br />He believes that optimal cognition is reached through a balance between these two modes of thinking. One is not better than the other. Thinking modes can be used in effective sequences.<br />He indicates that many challenging problem solving situations can be tackled through four stages of thinking:<br />1) Preparation in D-Mode,<br />2) Incubation in intuitive mode,<br />3) Illumination in intuitive mode, and<br />4) Verification in the D-mode.<br />The above is a good description of the scientific method from a psychological framework.

You will learn so much information that rarely makes it in the news, yet is far more important than the news.<br />Within this book, Reisner explains how water resources are misused due to poor government water policies.  The Bureau of Water Reclamation sells water to Western farmers for virtually nothing.  In turn, these farmers waste this precious resource by growing rice (the most water intensive crop with the lowest market value) in desertic areas.  As a result, farmers use about 75% of all water consumption in the West.<br />This book written over 15 years ago explains the underlying trends to the current water crisis in California.  But, as depicted in the book, this water crisis is entirely self induced by poor water management.  We should not be growing water intensive crops (rice) in deserts with subsidized water thereby triggering a constraint on both our demographic and economic growth in the West.<br />With better water management, including a reduction in water subsidy, there would be plenty of water for everyone.  This would include enough water to allow for demographic growth, industrial growth, and a thriving water efficient agricultural sector.<br />This book is as relevant today, as when it was first written.	2003-05-30

He described all the different ways in which human beings express unique aspects of emotional intelligence.  He makes a strong case that overall emotional intelligence is more important than IQ regarding reaching overall happiness and success in life.  You just have to look all around you in every day life, and observe that what he is saying holds true.<br />If human beings were solely intellectually intelligent, they would eventually all be replaced by a good computer with a good decision making software package.  Watch out the Matrix would take over.<br />Fortunately, this is not so.  Our lives are far more complex, and can't be run by binomial decisions.  Everything is associated with judgment calls.

I used to think of Michael Gelb as a Tony Buzan lite.  They are both fascinated by enhancing cognitive faculties every which way they can through such tools as mindmapping.  It happens Buzan always was first.<br />My opinion changed with this book.  Michael Gelb established himself as a coleader in the field of enhancing one's whole brain faculties.  In this book, he touches on so many different perspectives and techniques to develop your thinking abilities that I have to think of him as a real innovator.<br />Woops, I forgot the maestro himself, Leonardo Da Vinci, did it all a half millenium ago.<br />This fact does not detract from the book or Michael Gelb at all.  Michael Gelb's fascination with Leonardo's superior faculties in everything is really contagious.  Did you know that Leonardo was a world class entertainer, cook, and musician.  He played a number of musical instruments very proficiently.  He was apparently quite the athlete as a younger man.  Through Michael Gelb's description, Leonardo seemed rather unreal, at least compared to any contemporary human being.  Nevertheless, Leonardo comes accross so vividly.  Thus, from both a cultural and historical standpoint, this portrayal of Leonardo is very interesting.<br />Another interesting aspect of the book, is a well developed drawing course in the second half of the book.  I did these exercises.  They were fun to do, and I discovered I could draw reasonably well.  This was a fun surprise.  You probably will surprise yourself too, unless you know already that you are an excellent artist.	2003-05-28

So, I had much more fun learning about Adam Smith in this book, than reading the few paragraphs I managed to read from &quot;Wealth of Nations.&quot;<br />The one question is, where are the Scots today?  I guess just where the Greeks are.  Meaning a given group of people from a specific country or culture can have a spike of intellectual and innovative success during a short period of time.

This is certainly interesting. But, it is difficult to extract a main theme out of this book.<br />You also feel that this field is associated with a great deal of political correctness regarding a sensitive issue. So, the language is not always very direct. You often wonder what these political scientists are really saying in between the lines.<br />One great benefit from this book is that it got me acquainted with the 'World Value Survey.'  This is an amazing ongoing analysis of different nations culture regarding different axis such as secular vs religious, level of freedom, level of trust in national institution.

I think the best application of mindmapping is for studying, reviewing, and memorizing materials.  If I had known about mindmapping when I went through school(s), I would have done a lot better than I did.  Catching mindmapping a bit later in life, it allowed me to study a lot of new stuff much quicker than I would have otherwise.  There is really something about involving your whole brain in the learning process, instead of just the left one.  And, mindmapping does that naturally for you.	2003-05-28

He borrows this social vs. natural factor analysis from Homer-Dixon.<br />As mentioned above, a dimension to his writing, is Kaplan's quality as an \\"intellectual aggregator.\\" He borrows material from tens of luminaries on various subjects. So, he rarely develops a theory in vacuum. He first aggregates different blocks of a political theory and then connects the dots between the blocks. He does that better than most. This makes for a very insightful and informative book.	2003-05-28

It leans substantially on decision theory and behavioral economics.  Its main concept is \\"regret.\\"  Regret is downside risk.  We can insure against that downside risk by buying a Put option.  Even if we deal in illiquid markets where such options are not available, it is still key to calculate the economic value of regret or of that Put option (if it were to exist).  Similarly, the upside of a transaction is equivalent to buying a Call option.  Mr. Dembo comes up with this equation:  Upside - Lambda(Regret).  Lambda captures your risk tolerance.  If your risk tolerance is high, Lambda will be small.  The inverse is true too.<br />With this straightforward model, the authors can explain a whole lot of economic incentives with a behavioral component.  For instance, you can easily explain why most people would not mind playing roulette with just a dollar bill.  But, the same people would not play with $100 dollar bills.  In effect, most people would rather take on a bad risk (with poor odds) on a small scale, than take on a better risk (better odds) on a larger scale.	2003-05-28

He is incredibly arrogant, neurotic, rude, self centered, and narcissic.  He is also insightful, brilliant, artistic.  He understands the game like few others.  He also plays the game like few others.  It all comes through perfectly well in this biography.  Nothing in this book was surprising.  It was all expectable Mac in your face stuff.  And, it was so much fun.<br />On a more serious tone, Mac has a lot of smart wisdom to impart about the game, and the game's direction.  He makes a lot of recommendation that make a lot of sense, but unfortunately are utopic.  The most noteworthy of them, is that tennis should go back to wood racquets.  I fully agree.  Mac feels that the character of the game, and the associated skill requirement completely changed after that.<br />I don't know if anyone remembers the artistic, versatile styles of Adriano Panata, Ilie Nastase, Tom Okker, Manuel Santana.  They all played with wood racquets.  Their style of finesse and unpredictability is gone from the game.  John McEnroe also emulated that style.  Today, our only hope is Roger Federer who shows the versatility and talent of the past.  Unfortunately, he rarely passes the first round in any Gran Slam tournaments, and gets worn down by some anonymous grunter.	2003-05-28

All your life you probably have been told to work on your weakest link, to develop what you are missing, to become a renaissance person by turning all your weaknesses into strength.  This is nice, but completely utopic for one thing, and really painful for another.  Who wants to really seriously focus on their weaknesses.  If they are weaknesses, there are for a reason.  It is because you really don't like doing those things.  But, within a Protesto-Judeo-Christian upbringing, this was not an acceptable answer.<br />Well, maybe now it is.  Comes now this wonderful book, who allows every one to go out swinging on their strength alone, and become the best you can be.<br />The test alone, with the website follow up, is worth the price of the book.

It is objective.  It details the assumptions, and explain why forecasting population growth is associated with a high level of uncertainty.<br />Another chapter on the future of energy consumption is really bad.  It is a not so disguised subjective infomercial about alternative energy.  Although promoting the use of alternative energy is really laudable, it should not be confused with objective and integer forecasting simulation.  This one chapter should have never made it within this book in its existing form.	2003-05-28

I found this book made a fascinating subject really boring.  I had a tough time finnishing it.<br />In all fairness, I learned quite a few interesting things.  One of them being that the Greek civilization was not so great after all.  This civilization developed great intellect, but no technological innovators.  Their technology relied on harnessing the energy of their slaves period.  They had no incentive to innovate, that would have caused an idle and restless underclass prone to civil unrest.<br />I am sure there must be another much more interesting book about the same subject.	2003-05-28

Michael Gelb did a more cohesive and detailed job of fleshing out the cognitive faculties of the mind by studying Leonardo, than he did by studying this Dream Team.  Occasionally, the exercises appear a bit repetitive, boring, and uninspiring.<br />If I had not read this other book, I would have said that this book is great. Instead, it is very good.<br />Michael Gelb touches on the same subjects, concepts, and exercises as in 'Leonardo.'	2003-05-28

Within it, there is a test that will tell you what type of macro nutrient food mix (carbohydrate vs. protein) you will do best on.  This takes out the guess work out of nutrition.<br />The author explains also how extremely different diets have millions of succesfull followers.  Take Ornish high carbohydrate-low fat diet, and Atkins high protein-low carb diet; both have millions and millions of followers who swear their good health by these radically opposite diets.  How could that be?  It is pretty simple, the followers of a specific diet are individuals who thrive on this type of diet.  In other words, their specific metabolic type corresponds closely to the guru diet they follow.  But, this does not mean that one diet or the other is good for you.  You first have to find out your own metabolic type, then you will know.  This leads you from darkness into light, nothing less (at least as far as nutrition is concerned).	2003-05-28

Also, arbitrage is very weak, as there are no proper securities substitutes, shorting the indexes is too risky.  The \\"Noise Trader Risk\\" is too great.  Meaning equity values may continue to diverge long enough for the arbitrageurs to loose their shirt betting on convergence.  The investor type is a very important characteristic to factor.  This explains the close end fund puzzle.  The discount on closed end fund tracks the fate of small cap stocks.  When small cap stocks do poorly, the discount on closed end funds deepens.  This is because both investments are dominated by the same type of investors: individuals - small investors.  Thus, both investment types are subject to small investors' sentiments.	2003-05-28

That is an excellent book about Irish history in particular, and the dark ages in general.  If it was not for the Irish thirst for knowledge, a lot of key documents, and books would have been lost forever.<br />It also described St. Patrick as a titan of Irish history.  I thought he was just an excuse for all the Irish (and others) to get loaded once a year.  After reading this book, you will be awed by this man's life.  He brought culture, thirst of knowledge, and christian religion to the Irish.  At the time, the Irish were a rather wild bunch not prone to civilized orderly domestic lives.  They also had the strangest set of beliefs in the supernatural.  St. Patrick changed all that, but not the way you would expect it.  It was not through authority, damnation, instilling fear, or other common strategy of religious convertors.  It was through an amazing dedication to education, love of learning, respect for others lifestyle.  In other words, he made no effort in changing the rather wild Irish temperament.  He practiced a style of tolerant and open Christianity that is far more modern than what is practiced today.  If there were more St. Patrick(s) today, the Church would not be undergoing these multifaceted scandals and crisis as it is now.	2003-05-28

The character development of all the main players is in depth and fascinating.  The story thread is coherent, and makes complex topics related to optionality and other bizarre aspects of the hedge fund world very easy to understand.<br />Even though it is easy to read, there is a bunch of stuff for the finance practicioner too.  On the more technical aspects of this story, here is what I learned regarding what can go wrong in financial modeling:<br />1) understating volatility by using too short a data period when establishing volatility assumptions;<br />2) making volatility a constant instead of a dynamic random variable;<br />3) omitting correlation between apparently unrelated markets;<br />4) running into issues when selecting statistical distributions; 5) assuming the market is inefficient in your favor to boost your estimated returns;<br />Also, regarding investment theory, the book gives you another few gems.<br />1) You can exploit market inefficiencies, but typically not for very long within the same investment vehicle;<br />2) Don't go outside your field of expertise.  What works in one area, may not work at all in another.  LTCM was successful doing some arbitrage deals with long term Treasuries.  They later applied the same technics to merger &amp; acquisition situations in common stock, and got killed.<br />3) Leverage is a two edge sword even for Nobel prize laureates.  With leverage, the risk often increases faster than the return.<br />4) When you deal with esoteric stuff, don't assumme the markets are liquid.<br />5) When markets go down, assumme that everything correlates to each other much more than when markets go up.	2003-05-28

I read this book years ago just when it came out (mid 90s).  I did not pay that much attention afterwards.  I thought at the time, it was mildly interesting.  Man was I wrong.  This book was right on the money half a decade ahead of time.  In his book, he depicted perfectly well all the trends that would lead to a rather formidable deflation factor.  At the time he wrote the book, Japan was probably close to entering its deflationary phase.  But, no other country was.

Shiller makes a strong case that markets are not efficient, but respond to crowd psychology.<br />Shiller rebuts the Efficient Market Hypothesis.  He has analyzed many U.S. stock market crashes.  In each case, he did not find information absorbed by institutional and individual investors that justified the market downturns.  In all cases, it appears the investors were &quot;aware&quot; of the reasons for the market downturn as explained by the financial press after the downturn occurred.  For Shiller, this means that the reasons were false, and that investors do not digest information in such an efficient and immediate way as stated in the Efficient Market Hypothesis.<br />Shiller believes investors are irrational, and trade based on certain premises such as herd instinct, momentum, belief that stocks always go up.  These beliefs are reinforced by the media.  The resulting market valuation at the time the book was published (first quarter 2000, the market's peak) was far above its intrinsic value.  As they say, the rest is history.  Shiller's timing was perfect.  We have been in a Bear market ever since.	2003-05-28

The author has looked at more scientific data than anyone else.  That is why is advice is more balanced than various diet gurus who typically recommend very unbalanced diet.<br />The author explains the glycemic index very well.  By stating the fact that white rise is a high glycemic index food, he has irritated a lot of people.  Other nutritionists have questioned his theory, by commenting that Asian populations whose main foodstock is white rice, have far better health indicators than we do.  The author, however, explains this fact perfectly well by mentioning that Asian populations are active, lean, associated with a low BMI.  For such a population, the impact of a high glycemic index food is moderated.  But, when you take an American population that is not so active, often overweight, with a much higher BMI, such foods have a greater impact, and may increase risk of being increasingly overweight, and getting diabetes.<br />Whenever the author appears controversial, he typically explains out the issue very well.  And, at this stage of our nutritional knowledge, he appears to know this domain better than most.	2003-05-28

It is because of the quality of the book that an Oscar winning picture was made out of a rather obscure subject. Yet, as many said it before, the book is far richer and deeper than the movie ever was.<br />There are entire decades of Nash life that the movie glossed over.  One such example is when he went on several European trips, in the midst of his psychological crisis, and wanted to become a citizen of the World by renouncing his US citizenship.  This never made it in the movie.  And, how could it.  The movie was already long as is.<br />Also, Nash social life is far richer and (clinically strange) than the movie ever made it out to be. At one point, he is courting his future wife, his current girlfriend, and a boyfriend all at the same time.  This never made it in the movie either.  Russell Crowe was not big on conveying the gay stuff.  But, let there be no doubt, Nash was bisexual big time.<br />Nash is a far more perplexing, multi dimensional character in the book than he ever was in the movie. Yet, I loved the movie. I gather that tells you I really enjoyed this book.	2003-05-28
