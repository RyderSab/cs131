Emma Holly is known more for her erotica than romances, so when I started this book, I knew I was in for a hot hot read...and to be sure I was not disappointed.<BR>I loved the 'sweet' erotica mixed with the believable romance, and even the issue of Freddie's homosexuality was dealt with nicely and not just skimmed over.<BR>Edward was one of the BEST heroes I have read about in a loooong while. Stuffy and dour from outside and seething with repressed sexuality inside...just my kind of a guy!<BR>I am off to read Beyond Seduction now, and hope Ms Holly writes a couple of historicals soon, instead of the Werewolf books she is experimenting with now!	2003-09-25

I had read Green Darkness a long time ago (almost everybody here read the book a while back!). Anyways, since then I have read hundreds of other novels, but for some reason I have never been able to forget this novel.<BR>I still distinctly remember the main protagonists, and Ms Seton's style of writing had such a marvellous quality of taking you back to the Tudor Era, making you feel that you were a part of that period. I have read many historical romances since then, but rarely do I feel transported back to the time about which I am reading.<BR>Anyways, this is a wonderful book, and if you ever get your hands on it, read it and KEEP it.

It was romantic as well as very erotic. I cannot say the same about Total Surrender. There was something missing in this book.

It is because of heroes like Beau St Jules  that the the term 'male chauvinist pig' has been coined. Inspite of being REPEATEDLY unfaithful to the heroine, he was always getting jealous even if she spoke to another guy!<BR>Susan Johnson can write a good erotic romance as evinced in Brazen and Forbidden, where the heroes (inspite of being male sl*ts) were redeemable and lovable.<BR>Susan Johnson went so over the top with her description of Beau being the biggest rake in England that I have a hard time imagining Beau being faithful to Serena afer their marriage...	2003-07-21

It is erotic and breathtaking in places with a very brooding and dark atmosphere.<BR>Michael has to be the most tortured hero I have ever read about. At the begining most of his actions and thoughts did not make sense, but it all coalesced in the end.<BR>I deducted one star for foll. reasons:<BR>While the love scenes toward the begining were really hot and passionate, I felt that toward the latter part of the novel, thet lacked the fire, and I read on as if I was a dispassionate observer.<BR>Secondly, I never felt that I knew everyting about Michael's past....like why he loved Diane, I guess I wanted to know more about their relationship since Michael always thought about her 'passion for love and laughter', and I wanted to know what he saw in Diane that he didn't in all the other females.<BR>Lastly, I did not feel that everything was resolved between Anne and Michael....I would have liked to know what happened to them in the long run. The ending was way too abrupt!<BR>Inspite of this, the book deserves 4 stars because of the main protagonists and the way Ms Schone writes.	2003-07-15

It was written a long time ago, and is quite like the romances published in the early eighties where the hero was perpetually unfaithful to the heroine and the heroine was docile and obedient.<BR>The sex scenes were quite ok, though quite brief compared to her later novels.

This book is in a much more lighter vein than other SJ works...quite brief and without the historical details I like. It is definitely not as bad as it is made out to be. I found the H&H quite charming and enjoyed their light hearted bantering. One thing that I missed was SJ super steamy love scenes.

First, I felt a lot of issues were not resolved between the two.

This book was too bland for my liking, and while there were a lot of love scenes, they were much tamer than what I thought they would be.<BR>Secondly, the book was very short, 350 pages of large print, so I never felt that I got to know any of the characters...didn't care much for the hero to begin with!	2003-06-02

Cheryl Holt can conjure a very steamy atmosphere with her writing and coupled with the absence of purple prose, this one definitely deserves to be in the 'erotic romance' category.<BR>I would have been happier if she would have focused more on the main couple....It started off very nicely toward the begining, but Ms Holt introduced a lot of secondary characters which detracted from the story line. Still, it was a good read and I look forward to reading Total Surrender.	2003-05-31

I don't know what I was thinking when I ordered this one....I thought it would be another hot romance like Sheik. Unfortunately I found that this nocel was written way back in the eighties.

I love to read erotic romances, and uptil now I thought Susan Johnson was the best at writing them....Was I wrong!<BR>I purchased this book based upon the unusual storyline, and though I had some apprehensions before reading it, I realised I would have made a big mistake if I hadn't.<BR>What made me like this book more than any other work of erotic romance was the fact that Ms Schone took care to ensure that there was a bonding of the souls as well as that of the flesh. In so many of these romances, the autors are in a hurry to put in the next big sex scene that they forget the fact there is supposed to be romance too, along with the erotica.<BR>Ms Schone's love scenes are blunt, straightforward and free of purple prose. That's what makes them all the more erotic.<BR>I am on my way to buy The Lover and Gabriel's Woman, and I am sure that inspite of the negative reviews, I will definitely savour those books too.	2003-05-07

It focussed entirely on the heroine. Karim was there only in the begining of the book and then towards the end of it. While the love scenes were quite ok, most of them were with Zainab and other guys, which I didn't appreciate. In fact I was quite happy when I finished the book and stared reading The Lady's Tutor by Robin Schone....Now that is what I call an erotic romance.<BR>After reading The Love Slave, I have not bought anything by Ms Small as I feel she she dosen't write an erotic romance centred on the H&H (which I like), she writes more about the sexual experiences of the heroine and focusses only on her(which I absolutely do not like)!	2003-05-06

The hero, Gabriel, is refreshingly diffrent from the dukes and earls that abound as heroes in all historical romances. Elizabeth, the heroine, too is diffrent, in the sense that she pursues Gabriel more forcefully...generally it is the hero who wears down the heroine with his persistence, but in this case it was the reverse. It was fun to read a novel where the heroine takes the initative.<BR>The sex scenes were raunchy and erotic, and frankly I enjoyed reading them, only wished they were longer!<BR>What I didn't appreciae was that there were three stories involving three couples in the book. I felt the author wasted too much time on secondary characters, and frankly I was interested in reading only about the H&H.<BR>The worst thing in the book was that for the last hundread pages of the book, there was only one chapter devoted to Elizabeth and Gabriel, and that was really frustrating.<BR>The book would have been more believable and enjoyable if there was more interaction between the lead pair. I still have to read Love Lessons and Total Surrender, and I hope Ms Holt has devoted more time to the primary characters than the secondary ones!	2003-04-22

I have also read the prequel to this book, The Conqueror, and it is one of my all time favourites. The Promise of the Rose did not have the same level of scorching sensuality, nor was it as engrossing as The Conqueror, simply because there were too meany characters in this book and I felt that the author did not concentrate much on the hero and heroine.<BR>The book is still worth reading once, as it is a pretty fast and interesting read.<BR>I also liked the character of Geoffrey DeWarrenne, and hope BJ writes a hot book on him some day......	2003-04-20

I have read a lot of SJ books, but this one just didn't make me all hot and bothered, like some of her other work, in that sense it was pretty boring.

I do believe some authors are suffering from writers' block and hence churning out a lot of gibberish now a days. Kat Martins' Wicked Promise is one of those books probably written when she underwent a writers' block.<BR>The story line is so oft repeated that there is nothing much to say about it, but what takes the cake are the lead characters, especially Elizabeth. <BR>Both the h&amp;h are irritating to the core and garner no sympathy. It was not a very long book, but it still took 5 days for me to finish it.<BR>SKIP THIS ONE!	2002-05-31

This is probably the best book I have read by Brenda Joyce(Although I haven't read The Conqueror and its sequel as yet)<BR>Its got a very tight story line which keeps you interested throughout and marvellous lead characters.<BR>I think this is one of the most erotic books written by the author. Its a shame that her later novels are not as sexually charged as her previous ones. If she would have been writing these kind of hot medieval sagas still, I would have purchased all her books! <BR>But after I read The Rival, I was really disappointed and have stopped buying her novels.<BR>This book has it all. A great plot, interesting cast of characters (although she has taken a lot of liberties with the characters of Queen Elizabeth I and Robert Dudley!)<BR>Still, it is a very intense read with really hot love scenes and one of her best novels!	2002-05-28

This is one of the few good romances I have read in a long time.<BR>Definitely one of Ms Kleypas's more sensual works.<BR>Even though the plot and everything was good, I found that the novel was strangely lacking in depth, due to which I enjoyed the book immensely while I was reading it, but after a couple of weeks I realised that nothing in the book was memorable, other than the steamy scenes.<BR>Still, all said and done, it was better than some of the boring stuff I have read lately.	2002-05-20

I got this book thinking that it would be a satisfying romantic read like Ms Joyce's previous novels, but was greatly disturbed.<BR>There is hardly any romance in it and the book is full of trials and tribulations faced by the hero and heroine.<BR>I love to read intense love stories, so I am not against the dark factor of this novel, only that there isn't much of a love story in this one.<BR>Still it was a pretty fast read, and so the 3 stars.	2002-05-19

After having read almost all of Sandra Brown's full length novels, I have come to the conclusion that this is probably her best book. The hero, Ross Coleman is surely the best male character that she has ever created.<BR>The love story between Ross and Lydia is suely one of the most sensual and romantic one I have read in a long time.<BR>I have read the sequel to this novel, Another Dawn, which centres on Ross and Lydia's daughter Banner and Bubba Langston, one of the characters from Sunset Embrace. That too is a great novel, but nowhere as sensual and emotional as this one.<BR>That's why I was shocked about what happens to Ross at the end of Another Dawn!!...read Sunset Embrace if you are looking for a true hero you are not likely to forget anytime soon!	2002-04-05

This is my second Linda Howard novel, and it is surely better than my first, which was Now you see her.<br />My only complaint was that it was not a pure romance. Though the book was well written and fast paced, and the historical aspect was quite intriguing,I felt that not enough time and effort was devoted to the interaction between the two primary characters.<br />So there falling in love at the end seemed to be pretty implausible. I don't know why she wasted the first hundread pages of the book describing stuff that could easily have been brushed over.<br />Also,the stuff about the secret treasure wasn't fully explained, and the last few pages left me somewhat confused.<br />Other than these flaws, the book was a pretty interesting read.	2002-03-30

This was my first novel by the author, and now I know I am never gonna pick up any of her other books.<BR>The story was so slow and boring that I couldn't get past the first three chapters. After I started to find the hero as well as the heroine irritating, there was no point in reading it further.<BR>One of the few novels I didn't manage to finish!	2002-03-09

I just finished reading this book and this was my first book by the author.<BR>I liked her style of writing, though I found some of her dialouges unintentionally funny. I liked the eroticism in this book, but guess I wanted it to be more detailed. Apart from the first few love scenes, the rest seemed to be terribly rushed and brief.<BR>I liked the way in which Marcus's character was developed, though not much detail was given to Mark, because of which I didn't really appreciate the last part of the book.<BR>All in all, it was a pretty good read.	2002-03-07

This is definitely not one of Brown's best works, but still manages to hold your attention because of the fast pace of the book.<BR>I felt it had a lot of references to her earlier works, and somehow lacking in originality. Also, the ending was too insipid and boring, no great suspence or mystery in this one.	2002-02-18
US	39437817	RV0XO5YIWEK1U	0446601853	932954693	Charade	Books	5	0	0	N	N	probably her best work!	Of all the full length novels that Ms Brown has written, this one is surely her best(although I still haven't read The Switch, Alibi and Envy)<BR>This one has both mystery and romance, in equal proportions unlike her new novels which don't lay too much attention on the love aspect. <BR>I thought the relationship between Alex and Cat was the best that she has written. There was everything, especially a lot of sensuality and deep love. I wish she would write stuff like this more often!	2002-01-29

I think this novel felt more like an account of the hero's sexual escapades, and it was pretty disturbing reading about the various dalliances the hero had with all his mistresses.<BR>the worst part of the book was the hero being seduced by his own aunt at the age of 15, and it was reallly disturbing to read that he almost fell into bed with her daughter!!(his cousin sister)<BR>between so many ladies, the chemistry between brett(the hero) and storm(the heroine) never really excites you, though Storm's character was stronger than what you generally find in romance novels.	2002-01-28
US	39437817	RSTPY0HUOXZHL	0671568825	562966780	Now You See Her	Books	2	3	4	N	N	not that good!	After reading all the reviews of Linda Howard's books, I thought she would be a really great author. However, I was pretty dissappointed once I started reading this book(I have finished about three-fourths of the book)<BR>The sexual tension for which the author seems to be so renowned is certainly lacking in this one.There is hardly any interaction between the lead characters,the story focuses on the secondary characters as much as the lead ones.<BR>I found no reason as to why the hero fell so suddenly for Sweeney.<BR>I feel nothing for the hero & heroine as their is no real development of their characters. Overall, it is a pretty mediocre book.	2002-01-23

I think it is the most insubstantial and fluffiest romance I have ever read. There was no real story line and throughout the book, the lead characters either kept scowling, grinning, shouting or being plain angry.<BR>The language was so stilted that it took me 3 days to finish this one!There was no character development and I found everyone in this book getting on my nerves.	2002-01-17
US	39437817	R2EEOIYC36XJJ7	0553291254	556846790	Forbidden	Books	2	4	8	N	N	Absolute waste of time	I think this book is very wordy and could have been cut short by atleast a hundred pages. I really don't understand how some of the reviewers have praised the hero of this novel so much.<BR>I think he is too perfect, too experienced(in matters of sex,of course.Seems to me he spent a major portion of his thirty nine years  perfecting the art of sex), too rich, too controlled, too everything to be normal according to me. There should be atleast some shortcomings in a hero's character to make him more interesting.This guy has been there, done everything. And the references to his past sexual escapades are really not necessary.<BR>If the author was trying to project Etienne as some sex god, she really overdid it!<BR>There were too many secondary characters from her previous novels and too many scenes which were completely irrelevant and which bogged down the pace of the book.<BR>I should have paid more attention to the title of the novel before purchasing it.	2001-12-14
