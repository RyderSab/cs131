The Hobbit is the book that started the adventure of the Lord of The Rings. It is very descriptive and easy to picture the characters and the places that Tolkien writes about. The Hobbit is a mix of adventure &amp; fantasy. Do you like books with wizards, dragons, elves &amp; lost treasure? If you do then the book The Hobbit is the book for you. This is the story about a quiet hobbit called Bilbo Baggins of the shire. Bilbo goes on many adventures, but when he meets thirteen dwarves &amp; one wizard he goes with them and they embark on a quest that Bilbo will never forget. Read all about the dangers he faces like the dragon Smaug, and how the One Ring came to be found by him in golem's cave. If you read this book you will learn that all heroes come in all sizes.

I liked it because I like to read and write poems. This book is filled with poems. Tu-Pac wrote his poems about love, slavery, hatred, and racism. He wrote his poems for his mom and girlfriends during the times he was going through a struggle. When I read the poems he wrote he inspires me to stop whatever I'm doing and start writing a poem. Every time I start to read his books I always have a pen and paper and I start to write down ideas. I would recommend this book to people who like reading and writing poems about love and hate. I rate this book a 10 out of 10. That's why I liked Tu- Pac's anthology.<br />     By: Sarah P.	2003-06-10

I think Sharon Creech has and outstanding sense of imagination. Her book has inspired me to read and write poetry. I would recommend this book for people that have a great sense of wonder and poetry. This book is wonderful for three reasons. One, because it inspires you to read and write poetry. Two, because it has some very famous writers writing their poetry. And three, because it is an easy book to read. I would rate this book from 1-10, 10 being the best, a ten. This is a ten for 1 reason; it is a good book for people of ages 10+.

I liked this book for a lot of reasons because the adventures, the grabbers, and the action.  The adventures of the book made me want to read more, the grabbers made me want to see what happened next and the action made me say I like this book.  My opinion is if you are the type of person that likes action and adventures this book is the right one for you.   There's a lot of suspense like when the boy broke into the house and found the third child, or when his dad was right there sitting next to him and he was trying to hide a big book about the law and they don't even have a book about it.  The suspense in the book was great it made me want to read it more.

It was better it was great!!! Before I started the book I thought I would put it down after a few chapters but... as I kept getting farther and farther into the book I realized it was great. I could not even put it down, I never wanted the book to end. When you read this book it makes you think, think about how great full your life really is and what it would be like if you lived in the characters passion,  a young girl named Tish whose mother leaves to go find her husband that  her motherleaves Tish and her younger brother alone, Tish is stuck taking care of him by her self, with no money and hardly getting by. This book is so touching and is a slight tearjerker it also has a lot of drama, but that is what made the book almost glued to my hands as I read it, and in my opinion makes the book such a great book. I would recommend this book to anyone who has not read something great liek this book and someone who likes books like this, but even if you don't, I have a feeling you will like this book anyways.

This book really pulled me into the long treacherous history of  ancient Rome. Colleen McCullough does a great job of describing the toilsome adventures of Gaius Julius Caesar and his legions crossing over into enemy lands where very few can be trusted for people like brutus can be the real enemy. This book is as McCollough describes it: \\"Never was there one more adored yet feared than Gaius Julius Caesar, invincible on the battle field, he commands the love and loyalty of those who fight at his side and would gladly give there lives for his glory, but only ill fortune can come to the good men who underestimate him. For Rome is his glorious destiny - one that will impel him reluctantly to the banks of the rubicon...and beyond into triumphant legend\\". Now just listen to those wonderful words from Colleen McCollough  wouldn't that make you want to read this book. I would recommend  this book to teen and adult readers not that it's not great but the vocabulary and context are immense and suggestive. Overall it's a great book.<br />                                           Tom C.	2003-06-10

In order to understand this book you must first read the book Among the Hidden. Among the Imposters is the second book in the series. Among the Imposters captured my attention in the very first chapter. This is the absolute best book that I have ever read. Luke, the main character, has a lot of new and exciting things happen to him. In order to find out what happens to Luke you will have to read the book. My favorite part of the book is near the end of the book. Among the Imposters is a fictional book that will keep your eyes glued to the book at all times. Every time that I had to put this book down I would say can I please just finish the paragraph that I am on? Sometimes the teacher would say yes. Sometimes I would bring my book to my room to read it at night when I had to go to bed and then my mom would always come down and tell me lights out. I would wake up in the morning and start my day off reading this book. Margaret Peterson Haddix uses exquisite words to describe how Luke feels through out this book. For example: Luke longed to race straight to the woods as soon as he woke up the next morning. It was torture to stand patiently beside all the other boys, splashing water on his face. It was torture to sit still and slowly spoon in the lumpy oatmeal, when he longed to gulp it down and get out of there. That is one of the phrases that grabbed my attention now don't you want to read this book?<br /> By,<BR>    Sam C.	2003-06-10

I think that I liked it so much because I could really relate to it, how Tish the main character has the hardest times with her family. Except mine isn't so bad! I would recommend this book to any one who likes diary style writing. This book taught me that people have some really hard times and that we never realize what we have until it's truly gone, because I felt that's what Tish and her brother Matt were feeling when their father left them and then their mother did. They were living by themselves for a while with no one to be there for them and no one to love them! I think that if everybody were forced to read this book all of their reviews would be all positive!<br />          By: Hayden M.	2003-06-10

Luke, the main character, is a third child and is against the population law that has been around for years and years.  He meets another third child named Jen. This brave ten- year-old girl is teaching Luke the majority of what she already knows.  To find out what happens next, you will have to read the book.  Also, this book is probably the only book that I have read twice.  Among The Hidden is filled with action and excitement.  You should read this book because once you do, you will not even think about regretting it. Adding on, no matter how many times you read it, you will always find something new and interesting in all different parts of the book that you missed the first or second time.  You will enjoy reading this fun filled, exciting book over and over again, no matter how many times you may choose to read it.  Another reason that you should read this book is because the minute you start to read this book, it is like you are putting yourself right in the middle of the story.  It feels so real.  The best thing about the book is that you will never know what is going to happen next in the story even if you read it more than once.  I would rate this book a 5 out of 5 stars because it is filled with detail and interesting parts that you can't get away from.  Another thing is that it is filled with suspense.

I think that it is a terrible book for a 13-year-old boy.  I think that it is only good in the way that it is short and the words are in size font 20.  It is a very easy to read book just to get it over with.  It would be a great book for people who are obsessed with art.  I think art and paintings and drawings are so stupid and senseless.  My art teacher says, everything on earth revolves around art.  I dont understand how the entire universe has something that has to do with art.  Here is a brief summary about this book.  In a little town of Bolton, Kansas lives a little girl named Rockey.  She grew up in a foster home where she gets adopted and finds lots of love for her new family and also for art.  She discovers her true talent is making painting and drawing of the town and the people around her.  The town of Bolton, Kansas is deciding to create a monument in the town for the people who have died in past wars.  The man who is constructing the monument is named Mick.  Mick and Rockey meet and together they create a strong bond.  They paint and draw pictures of the town and decide that the town needs a statue of some sort.

There are hidden meanings in some of the phrases and words that even I had to look up in the dictionary.  The plot of this was great.

Lemony Snickets books are full of mystery and suspense.  That's why I like to read them.  His books are really hard to put down.  The endings leave you hanging on a string and you have to get the sequel.  So far he has written nine books and is on his tenth.  I can't wait for it to come out.  Over the year at John Winthrop I have read the ninth book.  The title is \\"The Carnivores Carnival\\".  Out of all of his books in \\"The Series of Unfortunate Events\\" this book has had the most suspense.  Some people have read the first book and stopped because they couldn't get into the book.  But, I didn't stop because the way he ended the books you couldn't stop reading them.  The Carnivores Carnival is about three children who have the worst life you could ever possibly imagine.  Their life is miserable.  There is something bad waiting around every turn.  In every book they find a clue on what they are trying to find out.  They have come close to it but it has never been correct and their lives still stay miserable.  What makes the book funny is that while Lemony Snicket writes the book he brings up things from the past in his life and thinks of everything in the book to be real.  Hopefully the tenth book will come out this summer so I can get to read that book.  Lemony Snickets books are great.<br />by Aleaha	2003-05-29

She changes her identity and makes illegal trips across the border, along with risking her life in order to save others from Nazis.  She is then caught and must find a way to survive.  I think this is one of the best books I have ever read.  Not only do I like autobiographies, I enjoy this story since is shows an example of heroism to many people.  Hanneke shows that she had the courage to risk her life and that she had little fear against the Nazis.  I cant really relate this book because I have never really done anything illegal in order to help someone.  Like Hanneke, I have never been in jail before.

This Book Number The Stars is about a girl and her friend. Her friend is Jewish and her family gets called up to go to a concentration camp. This is about the struggle to stay away from the Nazis. I got glued to the book and I think you will to because you are wondering throughout this book will the girl survive or get sent to a concentration camp.

But one of her books stands out to me out of the rest, by far best book ever The Outsider.  It could also easily be the Realistic Fiction book written.  It's funny because it was the first she had ever written at the age of sixteen.  I think that is purely amazing, the fact that she was only 16 when she wrote it. Probably because she might have been going through a similar situation.<BR>This book is mainly about a boy named Ponyboy that is in a gang with his brothers and a few other kids called the \\"Greasers.\\" There is this other gang full of rich people that are like jocks; they're called the \\"Socs.\\" The Greasers and Socs have constantly been fighting with each other but usually the Socs picked the fight. One night the socs took it too far and Johnny, a greaser, killed Bob, a Soc, and the sotyr goes on from there.<BR>But basically this is a great book, it keeps you in suspense, and there are surprises here and there that spice up the story.  So if you like Realistic Fiction or even if you hate books you should try this one.  You won't be sorry, believe me. It's not like a novel, it's actually quite short fewer than 200 pages, so it should go quick and it's a great book. <br />[...]	2003-05-29

The book is about a boy whose Mother is very abusive.  She makes him sleep on a cot in the basement and gives him little to nothing to eat everyday.  At one point in the story, she stabs him with a knife.  And this book and the other three that the author, Dave Pelzer has written, are based on a true story.  All of the stuff in the book actually happened to him.  If you havent read the book yet, you may think that it is cruel how some one could do this to their own child.  I have read the first book, A Child Called It and the second book, The Lost Boy and I still have yet to read the third, A Man Named Dave.

Whats in a Name is an intriguing tale about high school identities told from the point of view of ten different high school students. I recommend this book to anyone who has ever asked him or herself the question, Who am I? It is an easy story to relate to because in the book there are characters such as the jock, the new kid, and the snob. Not only is this story easy to relate to but it is also an interesting read! This story is about an election in town, in which the citizens are trying to decide whether to change the town name. The election turns friends into enemies and also makes people wonder if by changing the name they would also be changing the identity. It reminds the students of their own identities. I enjoyed the book very much because all through out the story suspense is built as you try to find out, What is ONeills secret. Or Who is Adam really? As you can see, I took pleasure in reading this book, Whats in a Name. I believe it is an entertaining, suspenseful, and intriguing novel.

If you prefer reading about one of your favorite authors than reading about magical lands or about World War II, I would HIGHLY recommend The Lost Boy by Dave Pelzer. He wrote about his horrid childhood when he was abused by his mother in only two books! The first book A Child Called It is about when he was living with his mother, but The Lost Boy is about when he finally gets away from his abusive mother, but has to now move from foster home to foster home in search of a good family to live with. It's a fantastic two book series with \\"suspense\\" that makes you want to keep reading it. I read The Lost Boy in one night because I had to keep reading to see what would happen next. But the only problem is that you should be able to handle kind of disturbing things. In the book A Child Called It, his mother made him do things that you wouldn't be able to believe, but that are just a little part of the book, and it's easy to pass. Also, this not just a regular autobiography, it's an unbelievable childhood tale which actually happened. Usually, I would think they would be about boring tales on how they began to write or how they got into writing. No offence to anyone, but some people like me don't enjoy reading those kind of books. But this autobiography is different. It compels you to keep reading. All in all, I loved this book, and I would recommend it to anyone![...]	2003-05-29

The plot was well developed and I could almost feel the tension of the characters forming. Overall, I was very much satisfied with the book- I hope there is a sequel to make a final ending!

This book made me feel a lot of mixed emotions but the strongest emotion I felt throughout the whole book was fear. First it made me think a lot more about life. It made me think about how important I it is to live your life to the fullest everyday and not take for granted what you have because... tomorrow isn't always promised. That's the part that frightens me it made me think a whole lot more about death. I realized that I should never go to sleep mad at anyone for the sheer fact that he or she or I myself may not be there the next day. These questions came to mind when I finished the book and truly thought about it. How will I die? Could this happen to me? When is my time? When I go is it really the end or will I be able to watch over my family and loved ones from the heavens above just as Susie did throughout the book? In all honesty, this book was amazing every detail kept me hooked.  I couldn't put it down I would read until I couldn't keep my eyes open anymore. I just think that people shouldn't read this book until they're ready to face the true and very harsh realities of death and loss.

This autobiography is a funny, touching, and compelling true story about the first women to graduate from the Citadel, a strict military collage with much discipline and hazing.  This is a great book, mainly for girls and women, that realizes how hard it was when men were considered superior.  It gives the important message that even though the world will always be filled with mean and hurtful people, it is possible to accomplish anything, even the impossible.  That is what Nancy Mace did; she was the first woman ever to graduate from the Citadel, something that seemed impossible for women before her.

He seeks the Ring he forged 2,000 years ago, holding within the small golden band the power to enslave the world. All he must do is find it. This is the precise situation that the people of Middle Earth had to go through in the Fellowship of the Ring the first book of the Lord of the Rings trilogy. This is one of the best books I have ever read. In this epic fantasy, the reader will experience breathtaking danger, overwhelming suspense, and beautifully created worlds. From the dark halls of Moria, to the Enchanted Golden Woods of Lothlorien, the reader watches Frodo Baggins and eight companions, on their journey to destroy the one ring. This can only be accomplished by throwing it into the fires of Mount. Doom, located at the heart of the Dark Lord's territory. The Fellowship of the Ring has exceptional fighting skills, and a strong will, but neither of these are enough to ward off the evil amongst them, and it won't be long until the lust for the Ring is so great, that the members of the Fellowship cannot resist it, and crave it for themselves. What will Frodo do when this happens?

Ever since I heard about his death I realized who he really is.  This book teaches me many facts about Dale Earnhardt's life of being a stock car racer.  Not only does it teach me about Dale Earnhardt, it also teaches me about his competitors and how they lost to the champion.  Like all biography, this book has information about his life as a child, like where he grew up, how his childhood was and.  It also teaches you about his racing career, tells you about all of the championships he won, and how his family was with him racing.  Believe it or not, thanks to this book I have a new person to be a fan of, this book told me about his two sons who also race.  Another thing is that this book helps me under stand the racing that he did, like what the flags were, penalties, etc.  All in all this biography of Dale Earnhardt teaches me about the legendary Dale Earnhardt and then some.<BR>                                      By, Andrew	2003-05-29
US	30878597	R1C0AQEMUXNC5K	0440416639	160627809	The Cay	Books	4	0	0	N	N	The Cay	The Cay written by Theodore Taylor illustrates the destruction of world war two. I think it is a compelling story that should be read by all. This book also teaches many morals witch are good to know in life. For example this story shows teamwork when the two main characters Philip and Timothy must build a hut to survive. As I mentioned the two main characters are Philip and Timothy. Philip is a young boy from Virgina. He is living on a cluster of Dutch Islands of the coast of Venezuela. Timothy is a older man who works on a boat that computes from the Islands to the U.S. They end up meeting in a usual way. I think all ages would enjoy this book. by chris	2003-05-29

I would recommend this book to anyone with a great imagination and a strong stomach.  I think almost everyone can connect to the setting of this great book, because it is in a normal town on the coast of California.  I think I preferred this book over others, because I can get an image of each setting in my head, letting me comprehend the book better.  I also liked this book a lot, because it was easy to get a picture of the characters in my head.  I like the characters, because they are just like you and me, they think and do things like anyone normal would do.  Another reason I like this book is, because it is easy to believe that the events in the book actually happen.	2003-05-29

The characters are well explained and I can relate to them well. There is a great plot in which there are many to be faced but they are all resolved or coped with. It is a realistic fiction book, and I would recommend it to girls of all ages. It isnt very challenging but it has a great moral. The book is written really well, it seems like the plot could happen in real life. I believe Hope Was Here by Joan Bauer is an excellent book that everyone should read.<br />By- Christine	2003-05-29

So, even though the beginning seems boring keep with it and you wont' regret it!<BR>        <BR>By,<BR>Shannon	2003-05-29

I don't even like to read. But I really liked this book. What got me going as I was reading are the good beginnings of each chapter. The book is about a boy named Earl who lives in Yonkers, NY with his abusive mother. The ghetto, he was living in at that time inspired him to become a rapper because of all the MC s around the streets. It tells how Earl grows up gradually becoming a well know rapper today by the name of, DMX. I thought that was interesting, especially since it's a true story. Plus I like his music a lot. So I thought that it would be cool to learn more about him. However, EARL is a book that junior high - middle school kids should read because the book contains explicit content (foul language and some violence). But I know they will enjoy it!<BR>  -Molly	2003-05-29

I find it fascinating that human nature can turn intelligent, thoughtful humans into automatons with no capacity for independent thinking. The book is based upon a real incident in which a teacher used his class as an experiment.  Appalled by the experiences of the Nazis, high school students question the fact that reasonable people can become easily controlled. Their teacher uses them to prove that just such a possibility exists. The book is thought provoking and, I admit, a bit scary. It makes one wonder:  Could I fall for a charismatic, Hitleresque leader?	2003-05-27
