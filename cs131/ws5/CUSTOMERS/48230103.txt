The whole &quot;Luna-K&quot; thing was not my cup of tea. I guess if you buy into the whole cult theme you would find this story enjoyable. Get this one at the library or the used bookstore!!	2004-07-29

While reading this book, it is almost like a smoothe conversation.  Bailey is at it again and you get to ride along with all the mayhem.  It's a fast,uncomplicated read - enjoy!  But why did we have to get rid of Jack??????	2004-05-11

I am not a huge fan of this author but this story really wasn't a great anything - no wonderful chemistry between the characters, the bad guy was bad but we really didn't care, and what is with all the broken sentences - almost every conversation would break off without completing the thought -IT WAS ANNOYING!!	2004-04-25

The story is touching - I felt for all the characters - Chloe for feeling abandoned, Dylan for his grieving, Jane for her lose, Sylvie for her sacrifice, Margaret for health.  Luanne Rice writes another beautiful story about the power of love.  Read it!!!	2004-02-28

Although, I did need the refresher from the &quot;Last Precinct&quot; - it has been years and many books in between that I almost totally forgot what happened in that book.  So I did not mind the synopsis going on in this book.  I did however, mind the short plot - after reviewing the last book there really wasn't much happening in &quot;Blowfly&quot;.  I felt there were characters introduced in this book that didn't need to be or were there for another motive (like Nic Robillard - is she worthy of an independent book of her own?) Basically, PC wrote this to reintroduce Benton back to the Scarpetta books (I missed him).<br />The book is what it is - borrow it from the library!!	2003-11-14

I won't summarize the plot again but I will say that Maggie O'Dell is much more likeable in this book than in the previous three books.  She isn't obsessing - she is much more mellow.  I still like Tully's character and wished he'd be more developed.  I thought I would miss Nick Morelli but truth be told I think Maggie and I have both moved on.  Good read - better than the last one especially!!	2003-08-14

I liked it so much that I thought I'd give the Irene Kelly series a try and I enjoyed the first one.  I imagine her writing gets better (it did in NINE) - this story is a little dated (they use pay phones not cell phones, use the term \\"yuppies\\" - stuff like that).  I am going to read the next in the series - I found the main characters real and likeable.	2003-07-01

I liked both the main characters and thought they acted like normal people (unlike some characters in JM books).
