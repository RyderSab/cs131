It was THAT good.  And so original, it kept me guessing right to the very end, which is kind of hard sometimes, since I read so many mysteries and can usually unravel the plot twists and other writer's devices well before the end of any book.<br /><br />I grabbed a copy of this book after a friend said she was starting a new blook club and that this would be the first reading selection for it.  I groaned inwardly, as I held the 550+ page book in my hands, thinking there was no way I'd have it read in the two weeks' time she had given me, on top of working full-time, taking care of my child, and spending time with my new husband.  But, once I started reading this book, I hated to put it down. I carried it around with me and read whenever I could: waiting in the doctor's office, waiting for my daughter in the carpool line at school, etc.  I know people thought I was crazy, but this is one of those books where, when you put it down, you keep thinking about the characters and what they're doing, what they will be doing next.<br /><br />I was enchanted by the loving relationship between Clare and Henry.  And the time traveling, as it was described, wasn't hokey or strange.  It just worked.  I don't know how the author did it, but she describes it in such a way that, by the end of the book, you just accept it as an everyday sort of thing.<br /><br />Keep the tissues handy when reading this book, however.  I can't remember the last time a book made me cry (maybe \\"The Lovely Bones\\"?) but I usually don't cry reading books.  This one, however, had me crying a few times.  It is a deeply emotional book about the powers of true love.  It is definitely worth the read!  I have been recommending to everyone I know.	2005-10-02

In this book, Jeremy Jacob finds out the hard way, when he leaves with a band of pirates while visiting the beach with his family.  He thinks it is going to be great to be a pirate, until the realities of that lifestyle set in (for example, pirates do not tuck you in at night).<br /><br />This book is SO cute and VERY funny.  The illustrations are wonderful and the story will make you laugh out loud.  My daughter loves yelling things along with the pirates in the story, like \\"No tucking!\\" and \\"A good one to boot!\\"  She can hear this story again and again and doesn't seem to get tired of it, as she does with many other stories.  Luckily, this is one of those stories that we don't mind reading night after night after night.......  It is DEFINITELY worth the price.	2005-09-07

I am generally not a fantasy reader, but am trying to read some of the books that my students and friends recommend.  This book came HIGHLY recommended by my sister and a few of my students at school.<br /><br />Written in alternating points of view, from the magician in training, Nathaniel, to the demon Bartimaeus, this book tells the story of what can happen when one gets a little too ambitious and things go out of control.  While Nathaniel doesn't necessarily mean for things to go badly, they generally do.  He doesn't pay much heed to the warnings of the dijinni Bartimaeus, whom he has summoned.  And let me tell you, Bartimaeus has great voice in this book.  His comments and sidenotes will make you laugh aloud.<br /><br />If you're a fan of fantasy and enjoy the Artemis Fowl books, as well as the Harry Potter series, then this is definitely the book for you.  Once you start reading it, you won't be able to put it down.  Since the chapters alternate between the two points of view, I found it to be very original, as well as entertaining.  But really, this is one of those books that is worth the read!	2005-09-07

Being a fan of the Shadow Children series, I couldn't help but wonder if this book would compare to the others before it.  Especially when I saw that Trey would be the major focus of the plot.  Since the other books have pretty much centered around Luke/Lee, I thought that maybe this book wouldn't be as good as the others.<br /><br />Boy, was I wrong.<br /><br />This book is GREAT and a much-welcomed part of the series.  In this installment, you learn more about the Population Police and even get a look at their new headquarters.  Luke, Nina, and some of the others have been captured, so it is up to Trey to rescue them.  But is he brave enough?<br /><br />If you are a fan of this series, you definitely CANNOT miss this book.  It really helps to move the series along and is one of those books that once you start reading it, you won't be able to put it down.	2005-09-05

And let me tell you, this book was VERY amusing and a fun read!<br /><br />Bob, a poor peasant meets a wizard-in-training and is given a magic sword.  He also gets advice on how to kill dragons.  Interspersed with humorous dialogue and other zany characters (my favorites being the ladies in distress who refuse his help because he isn't an official knight), the plot takes off and Bob becomes famous throughout the lands.<br /><br />If you're looking for something light and entertaining, this is the book for you.  It was definitely worth the read!	2005-08-28

If you want a book that will stick with you, long after you have put it down, you really NEED to read this book. It makes you question what is really important in life.<br /><br />Do the things that you are concerned about really matter? Clothes?  Cars?  That person at work who seems to be on the phone all day long?  For example, if you spend an extra couple of minutes eating with your family and you don't get around to ironing your shirt before you go out today, will it make THAT big of a difference in the grand scheme of things?<br /><br />The author, Mitch, realizes (with his old professor's help) thoughout the course of this story that it is the people in our lives and our relationships with those people that matter most and that material possessions: fancy jewelry, luxury cars, and big investments will never have quite the payout that a supportive network of family and friends has. In doing so, Mitch is also able to thank the one teacher in his life who really made a difference.<br /><br />This book will make you rethink all of those things that are stressing you out in your everyday life.  It made me ask the question, \\"Is that really going to matter in the long run?\\" about the little things that were making me angry or stressed.  This is definitely a book that EVERYONE should read. I am passing it on to my husband to read next and then to my sister. :)	2005-08-10
US	51847073	R2UFIQBFRGNAG3	0679720200	882163178	The Stranger	Books	2	5	8	N	N	A quick read!	This is one of those books that you come across in your life that people talk about and mention to you a few times and eventually you get around to reading it.  Since it's only about 123 pages long, it is definitely a quick read.  The storyline goes at a good pace and there's just enough happening to keep you interested in the plot.<br /><br />Most people I've talked to about this book didn't care for the lack of details.  That didn't bother me so much.  The only reason that I am not giving this book a better review is because of my frustration with the main character.  If Mersault would just CARE about something, anything, the outcome of this story would be so much different.  Sure, this is the point the author is trying to get across, but still.  I found Mersault's stand-offish attitude to be very frustrating.<br /><br />This is definitely one of those books that you want to discuss with a friend when you are finished, so be sure that if you grab this book, grab another copy for a friend as well.	2005-07-31

To tell you the truth, I ran out at midnight on the release night for this book to buy it, even though I was on my honeymoon.  My new husband, however, understands, as he has watched me run to the midnight parties for the last few book releases.  I just don't think he was so happy when I wanted to read while we were honeymooning.<br /><br />This book picks up where #5 left off and it is just as good as the others.  I don't want to give away the ending (I know some reviewers have mentioned it) but you will be surprised!  This book, while full of the description and dialogue that Rowling fans have come to love, also takes us further into Harry's past and gives us a glimpse of what is yet to come in Harry's future.<br /><br />If you have read the other books in the Harry Potter series, you definitely HAVE to read this book!!!!  Remember, there is only one more book to be released in this series and the books get better every time.  This one will be hard to top.	2005-07-31

Yann Martel (the author) admitted that he took the general premise (kid in boat with exotic cat) for this book from another one, published in 1981, Schliar's \\"Max and the Cats.\\"  So, the ideas for this novel aren't as original as some people may believe.<br /><br />Sure, it's a great survival story.  I was amazed by the kid's creativity when it came to training the tiger and eating (being able to catch fish, for example).  And the courage he displays while alone in the middle of the ocean is tremendous.<br /><br />I read this book mainly because I had heard a lot of talk about it and my department had chosen it as a summer read for our students.  After the first 150 pages or so, I put the book down and let it sit around for a month before I touched it again.  The beginning of this book, while giving the background on the characters, also spouted a LOT of religion.  I ended up skipping about 20 pages of religious banter before I continued  with the story.<br /><br />The first few pages of the shipwreck scenes are GREAT in this book.  Especially when Pi is calling to Richard Parker.  That, arguably, is the BEST scene in the whole book (and one that I will definitely look at in the classroom).  After that, however, you have another hundred or so pages of \\"I am sitting in a boat with a tiger that could kill me at any minute,\\" and that gets really old, really fast.<br /><br />Some reviewers have said that they really liked the ending to this book and I have to say, I was disappointed when I was finished.  Why did I waste my time? I kept asking myself.  I know the real reasons: I am a teacher and knew I'd have to teach this book.  Also, I was hoping this book would get better.  If some pieces of this book were not as drawn-out, this would be a GREAT book.  However, I thought parts of it were just too wordy and boring to give it two thumbs up.	2005-07-30

If you want to start reading a good book series, you may want to grab this book.  This is the first of several books.  In this one, you get all of the background information.<br /><br />Luke is a third child in a futuristic society, where families are only allowed to have two children.  His parents hide him away and he knows a quiet family life, one in which he is made to hide a lot and keep quiet, so that the population police will not know that he exists.  It is a lonely life for Luke, who wishes he could go outside and play, like his brothers do, and also go to school, to leave the house and go anywhere.<br /><br />When the land behind their farm is developed into a neighborhood, Luke is shocked to meet another child like him, Jen.  She tells him all about other \\"shadow children\\" who live hidden away from the rest of society.  When Jen tells him about a big rally that she's organizing to support the hidden children, will Luke risk his life by going to it?  Does he trust his new friend with his life?  Read this book and you'll find out.  It will definitely keep you on the edge of your seat (and you'll want to have the 2nd book in the series, \\"Among the Impostors\\" ready and waiting to read when you're done with this one).	2005-07-24

I picked this book up, thinking that maybe it was something I could recommend to my teenagers at school and keep in my classrom library as a lending copy.  I will be taking it to the used bookstore instead.  Here, I was hoping for another gossipy book, like the Georgia Nicholson series (Angus, Thongs, and Full-Frontal Snogging) or maybe even the \\"Mates, Dates, and...\\" series.  Instead, this book is more mature and graphic than those other two choices and, knowing the parents in my school, they would have this book removed anyway, due to the graphic language.<br /><br />While I believe that teens should have books that they can relate to, I still just don't see where this book would fit in.  Most of the kids I know do not carry Prada bags and wear Burberry jackets.  Most don't go to the social elite soirees and such, so they just wouldn't \\"get\\" this book.  It is way too far removed from their own experiences, with the exception of the language used by the teens in the story.<br /><br />One GREAT thing about this book, however, was the \\"Gossip Girl\\" webpage that caught the readers up on what was happening with each character.  It was interesting how, throughout the story, some of the minor characters would mention things that had been on the website.<br /><br />I just couldn't get into this book at all.  There wasn't one major character that the book focused on and the characters were so shallow, it was hard to like any of them.  They were also pretty undeveloped and flat, mostly stuck-up rich kids who were budding alcoholics.  I have seen better writing on after-school specials.  I will probably skip the rest of this series and if you choose to read this book, you probably will do the same.	2005-07-24

I've been reading this series on and off for the past year and the books always keep me guessing.  In this book, Luke, now posing as Lee, is still at the Hendricks School, when his \\"brother\\" shows up.  Of course, this is not one of his real brothers, but Smits, the brother of the REAL \\"Lee,\\" who died (Luke had taken his identity).<br /><br />This book could be really confusing if you haven't read the rest of the series first, so you may want to pick up the first book in the series \\"Among the Hidden\\" before reading this one.  The books in this series are always fast-paced and easy to read.  Plus, they keep you guessing.  :)  Definitely a good choice, for readers of this series!	2005-07-24

I read a lot of young adult novels and lately, have been reading quite a few that are written from a teenage girl's perspective.  I picked this book up at the library, where it had just been placed on the \\"What's new?\\" table.<br /><br />This book, a first for the author, is written in blog form by the narrator, Raisin.  Poor Raisin has had to move across the country after her parents' divorce and is trying to fit in at her new school, while keeping her friends back home up-to-date on her progress. Both good and bad things happen along the way and her friends leave comments to her on her blog space, which I thought, really added to the story.<br /><br />This was a cute teen story and it read very quickly.  I finished it in an afternoon (I didn't really want to put it down once I started reading it).  If you're looking for a fun story that you can read fairly quickly, you may want to give Raisin a try.  :)	2005-07-07
US	51847073	R1AKJ1TDSUD20W	0064407314	610990578	Monster	Books	5	1	1	N	N	Thought-provoking novel	As a high school teacher, I chose this as one of the books for my freshmen to read, because it is high-interest and is a quick read.  And, let's face it, the author (Walter Dean Myers) is great!  I also really liked the format of this book.<br /><br />Written as a screenplay, so that it would easily be transferred into movie-format, the narrator (Steve Harmon) tells his story.  What happens when you're a teenage black man, accused of murder?  This book tells it all, from Steve's point of view...how the people automatically assume that you're a monster; you're guilty.<br /><br />Steve knows that he is a good person deep-down and seems to be really frustrated with the idea of being in prison and going on trial, on top of feeling bad for worrying his parents to death.  What you have here is a heart-wrenching novel that shows just how scary the judicial system (and prisons) are, especially for innocent, young people.  This novel is sit-on-the-edge-of-your-seat good and one that you won't be able to put down very easily.  Definitely a book worth reading.	2005-07-07

For fans of the series, this latest installment is a welcome addition.  The Sex God (Robbie) is still off in Kiwi-a-gogo land (as in the previous book, \\"Away Laughing on a Fast Camel\\") Masimo, the new lead singer for the Stiff Dylans (and Georgia's new love interest) heads back to America to visit his family.  When Georgia's Dad gets an opportunity to go to Memphis, TN for a Robin Reliant Convention, the family joins him in a fun trip to Hamburger-a-gogo land (America).<br /><br />This book was very funny, as all in this series are.  I think what was especially funny were the scenes in America, since they visit downtown Memphis and also Graceland, where Georgia is overwhelmed by the friendly southerners and all of the fat (and old) Elvis wannabes.  :)<br /><br />Definitely a MUST READ book if you are a fan of the series.  I can't wait to see what happens in the next book......will Georgia and Masimo end up a couple?  Will the Sex God return?  We can only wait and see......	2005-07-04

What is a sex kitten to do?  Georgia's adventures are in tune with all of the previous ones......fun get-togethers with the ace gang, trying out new make-up and boy entrancers.  And this book includes the addition of Gordy, one of Angus' offspring as well as a NEW Sex God, Masimo, the new singer for the Stiff Dylans.

I received this book for free in the mail, as I do book reviews for a couple of different publishers.  I hadn't heard of the book before and hadn't noticed it in the bookstore, but who argues with free, right?<br /><br />This book was a quick read.  It did have some problems though.  First of all, the character names I found to be far-fetched.  I mean, really, how many girls have you known or met named Thisbe?<br /><br />It reminded me a lot of high school, since I was a high school student in the late 80's and early 90's.  Not that I was in the same league with these girls, but I won't say I was a saint either.  Parents shouldn't kid themselves that their teenagers are not involved in sex and other things like alcohol and drugs.  Many are and most will at some time experiment with one or the other, no matter how \\"good\\" they are.  The majority of them speak like the girls in this book also.  I have taught high school for enough years to know this is true.<br /><br />\\"The times, they are a-changin\\", Bob Dylan once sang.  And yes, they have changed since Colleen Curran was in high school, but not as much as some parents would hope.<br /><br />On the flip-side, I still won't put this one in my high school classroom as a book to lend to students.  The title alone would have me in the principal's office in a heartbeat and I really don't think a parent would find it a \\"suitable\\" title to be brought home.  I think my copy is headed straight for the \\"used\\" bin.	2005-07-03

First of all, this is a GREAT book that is hard to put down once you start reading it.  You'll wonder, do angels really exist?  Lani (pronounced Lonnie) seems feminine and masculine at the same time.  With his girlish features, he becomes the outcast at the high school....and it doesn't help that he's new to town either.  Luckily, he finds a friend in Claire, who is in remission from leukemia and whose friends are too creeped out about her courageous battle with cancer to talk about it with her.<br /><br />Lani, as Claire finds out, is a good listener and also gives good advice.  But when the other people in town accuse Lani of being gay and propositioning one of the town drunks, things go a little haywire.  Should Claire stick with the friends she's known for years or this he-she, Lani, who has only been around a few days?  Is she seeing things conveniently or is what she sees the truth?<br /><br />This book, once I opened it, was a hard one to put down and it kept me going right up until the ending.  If you're looking for a book that will hold your attention and keep you on the edge of your seat, this book is definitely for you.	2005-06-28

I thought Gathering Blue was okay, but then this one comes along.  Kind of strange to get used to the way they talk \\"This is Village\\" and how people don't go \\"into Forest\\".  This book, like the two beforehand, is another futuristic tale, set in a near-utopian society.  It was nice to see the return of Kira (Gathering Blue) and Jonas (The Giver, here, known as Leader).  The book read very quickly and was interesting.  It was just missing something.  Some spark of something to make it a GREAT book.  Don't get me wrong, it was good.....just not great.  The storyline was good and the characters are exceptional (as in all of her books) but I think there could have been something more there.  In all, a good read, ESPECIALLY for those fans of The Giver and Gathering Blue.	2005-06-24

First, I will say that I have had this title on my \\"must read\\" list for well over a year, but only picked it up this summer after my school decided that the kids should read it for a summer reading book.  Since I'll have to teach it when school returns, I figured I'd better read the book.  :)<br /><br />This book is a must-read for teens and I am going to suggest it to my adult friends as well.  A GREAT story about how life is in the high school, how people get ostracized for doing or saying a single thing (or not, in this case), also a good look at how clique-ish high schoolers can be.  I couldn't put the book down once I started it, so I read it all in one sitting.<br /><br />I don't want to give the whole plot, like a few other reviews, but in this book, you have a girl who is raped at a summer party and then keeps silent about it.  She's the social outcast of the entire school after that and has to deal by herself.  And don't think her parents are helping her out any.  They're a whole new set of problems for her to deal with.  I really think if you start this book, you won't be able to put it down.  It is THAT good.	2005-06-24

Wow, I am amazed every time a new Sammy Keyes book comes out.  Each one is better than the one before it.  In this book, not only is it bad enough to be the \\"lucky\\" number 13, but Sammy has to tolerate a visit from Lady Lana (her mom) on top of evil Heather's jealous rages.<br /><br />In this book, Sammy finds a dead cat on her birthday and, because she IS Sammy, she can't just let it go.  She HAS to find out where that dead cat came from.  Why was it in the dumpster?  Who had killed it?  The answers to those questions almost cost Sammy her life.  This book, like the others in the series, was hard to put down once I started it.  I tend to read Sammy Keyes books in a day, starting in the morning and ending in the evening when I am finished.  :)  This book was no exception and is DEFINTELY worth the price.<br /><br />ALL mystery fans will love Sammy.  It's funny though, as a fan of mystery books, I am always surprised at how the Sammy Keyes books end.....when I read mysteries from other authors (Mary Higgins Clark, Sue Grafton, etc.) I can usually figure out the exact ending after about a hundred pages and am never surprised.  Not so with Sammy Keyes.  This book has been the highlight of my summer reading so far.  It definitely should not be missed!	2005-06-22

Okay, everyone at work RAVED about this book and how great it was (even a couple of guys) so I decided I HAD to read this during my summer vacation.<br /><br />Let me tell you one thing about this book: it does NOT live up to the hype.  Book clubs and others are really talking about this book and many people told me they just couldn't put it down.  I did not have that problem.<br /><br />Sure, the idea is an interesting one: white girl runs away with a black woman in the south, right around the time of the Civil Rights Act.  It was very predictable and dry.  Yes, I learned some interesting things about bees, but this is one book that, after reading it, I felt like I'd wasted my time.  I kept waiting for something BIG to happen.  The book is 302 pages long, so around page 282, I decided that it probably wouldn't happen and it didn't.<br /><br />Very predictable, like I said.  Give me a James Patterson novel or something from Mary Higgins Clark.  At least their stuff keeps me guessing until the very end.	2005-06-12

People always say not to judge a book by its cover, but when I saw the cover on this book, I had to have it (you'll see what I mean...the holographic swirl patterns are pretty cool).  I'm glad I grabbed it.<br />If you're read any of the other reviews for this book, you already know some basic facts.  Molly is an orphan  (we read a lot of orphan books, don't we?) who is not the smartest, prettiest, or most popular.  In fact, most of the kids at the orphanage make fun of her, except for her good friend, Rocky.<br />When Molly finds an old book on hypnotism at the library and hears an ugly man screaming at the librarian about it, she knows this book must be special, so she takes it.  Back at the orphanage, Molly reads the book and works on her hypnotism skills, eventually using them to leave the orphanage and have a grand adventure, which lands her in America.<br />Full of twists and turns, readers young and old alike will enjoy Molly's adventures, as she uses her hypnotism on all sorts of unsuspecting people.  I enjoyed the book, although I did find a couple of parts to be rather predictable.  Please don't compare this book to Harry Potter.  Sure, it has the whole orphan-thing going for it, but the same can be said about the Lemony Snickett books.  This book stands by itself and is actually a pretty good (and quick) read.	2003-07-16

This one was exciting and had me going until the very end.  I wasn't sure who to blame and you know, Sammy caught on before I did.  Now, given the fact that she's 12 and I'm not....plus the fact that I've read a lot of mysteries and should be able to read between the lines, that is saying a lot.  Sammy will keep fans and readers on the edges of their seats, wondering what she will do next and breathlessly hoping that she won't get caught.  Her journey, with friend Marissa, to Hollywood in this story is great....I love the detail given about the people who hang around in the bus depots.  Also, the appearance of her mother (Lady Lana) was GREAT...as fans know, she doesn't appear in the other books, so this was a great way to find out about her.  This book is definitely a great choice for mystery fans!	2003-07-09

So, having the two together is a dream come true.  If you haven't heard of Sammy Keyes, you really need to pick up one of the books in the series and read it (preferably this title!).  You'll be hooked.  Sammy, a spunky 7th grader, doesn't take no for an answer and often lets her curiousness get her into trouble.  Think of Nancy Drew with an attitude and high tops.<br />This book, the newest in the series, was full of suspense, humor, and action.  This one had me guessing until almost the very end.  Also, mine came with a free cd, which had a short reading from another Sammy Keyes book, read by the author.  Heck, that was worth the money.  Also included were a couple of Sammy Keyes songs.  If you love mysteries, grab a copy of this book.  You'll be hooked on the series!	2003-07-09

Okay, I love the Sammy Keyes series, but I recently finished this book and let me tell you, I knew exactly who the guilty party/parties were from the beginning.  Usually, there are a lot of twists and turns in this series.  Unfortunately, that was not the case in this book.  While I love Sammy, in this one the facts were slapping her in the face and she didn't realize it until the end, which is pretty hard to believe if you've read any of the other books; usually Sammy is pretty much \\"on the ball\\".  An enjoyable read for me, mainly because I am a mystery fan, but not a great guessing game as to who-did-it.  I'd dare to say that ANY of the other Sammy Keyes books would probably be a better choice for a reader who is new to the series.	2003-07-09
US	51847073	R29GMU6B6QZBQM	0553570870	792257938	Telling Christina Goodbye	Books	4	2	2	N	N	A good book about teen death	I just read this book, after ordering it for my classroom (I like to preview what's in my classroom library before making it available).  This book hits the nail on the head: How do teens go on with their lives when one of their friends dies?<br />This story hit close to home for me, since I lost a good friend while in high school...and we were in a car accident together, just like the characters in this book.  I lived, he didn't.  Like Trisha, I had to accept the fact that accidents happen and sometimes not everyone lives.  We all make mistakes, it's just how you work through them that makes you a better, stronger person and helps you to grow.<br />I can't think of a better book that deals with all of the emotions and quesitons that teens face when a peer dies.  This author definitely knows her stuff and I would gladly recommend this book (and most of her others) to the teens in my classroom.  It is high on detail (the senory details in the accident scene were excellent) and content.	2003-06-22

But I did need the tissues quite a few times (almost every chapter, if not more often than that).  I got this book at the library because I'd had so many people tell me, \\"You've GOT to read this book.  YOU would LOVE it!\\"  So, I grabbed it on Friday.  I finished on Saturday.  I found it VERY hard to put down.<br />In a nutshell, what this book has going for it is VOICE.  The main character (as you know if you've read enough reviews about this one) is a dead girl in heaven.  Her story, while fast-paced and thrilling is also one that tugs at your heart.  You really want the bad guy to get caught and for her family to find her body, so they'll have closure in their lives.  Will her family move on without her?  Will they remember her?  You sit down with Susie and feel all of her wonderings and desires.  The scenes with her family, who were having such a difficult time dealing with her disappearance and death, were the most heartbreaking scenes that I've read in a long time.<br />Will you like the book?  Probably.  I LOVED it.  This is definitely the BEST book I have read in a while.  If Oprah still had her book club running with new books (she's into classics now) this would have been an excellent choice for her and there's no doubt in my mind that she would have picked this book.  When you read this book, grab one for a friend too.  You'll want to talk to someone who has read it and it will drive you crazy if you have no one to talk to.  Trust me!  :)	2003-06-22

It was definitely WORTH the read.  The mysteries are quick and easy....no 300+ pager here.  The only bad thing was that I really didn't care for the ending on the last story.  it just kind of ended very suddenly, when things were getting good.  Overall though, this book was a quick read and was enjoyable.  I loved the characters, although I couldn't relate to that terrible yearning to go home and make my husband a gourmet meal!	2002-07-09

This was a great book, which took me all of two days to read, as I could not put it down. I am a Mary Higgins Clark fan and have read everything by her. This is her first book told from the first person point of view and it really works!<br />Ellie, an investigative reporter and the younger sister of a murdered girl, sets off to prove the murderer's guilt when he is released from prison twenty-two years later. He has almost the whole town believing that he is an innocent man who has served time for someone else's crime. Of course, someone believes that Ellie must be stopped and her life is put in jeopardy.<br />This is a book full of suspense that had me on the edge of my seat. I hope Ms. Clark brings back Ellie in another book (like she did with Alvirah). She's a great character!	2002-06-23

Andrews fan for almost 20 years.  HER books were much better then, much better than the books the ghostwriter puts out now.  Why?  Because he uses a formula to write these books.<br />Now this book had a great story.  A ritzy lifestyle, interesting people, fancy mansions.  I liked Willow and wanted to know more after reading it and this book picked up the trail really well.  However, it was VERY predicatble, even for fans who have only read a couple of the V.C. Andrews books.  Yep, things are going to look rosy for Willow for a bit, but as a fan, I KNEW something bad would happen right before the ending and it did.  Typical.  But, all in all, this one has a great storyline and interesting characters and was a really quick read.  Great for any V.C. Andrews fan.<br />And, as for those awful letters at the end of these books.  Give me a break...	2002-06-11

I received an advance reader's copy of this book and have been thinking of it ever since.  The fictional land of Nollop brings forth some interesting characters.  The fact that this novel is told through letters, which are increasingly more and more difficult to write because of the crazy laws that keep going into effect, really makes this book different from many others that I have read lately.  My only reason for giving this book 4 stars instead of 5 is because I found it to be a little predictable.  Otherwise, this is a great story that would be an excellent selection for a reading group or even a classroom (I plan to use it in my own classroom) as it should bring some lively discussions.	2002-06-08

This book ranks right up there with them, although it does have a pretty slow beginning.  In this book, you find a country family who are invited to go to visit the big city (Chicago) for the World's Exposition.  (In the last two books, the city kids went to the small town.)  Peck seems to have all of his facts straight about the 1893 World's Exposition in Chicago and these facts make the story more believable and a delight to read.  From Buffalo Bill Cody to the starlet Lillian Russell and beyond to the legendary Mayor Harrison, Grandpa and the kids have some wonderful adventures in the Windy City.  Definitely a must-read for Peck fans, as well as history buffs, Chicagoans and former ones, like myself.	2002-01-22

I absolutely could not put it down.  The tale follows the lives of four best friends and one pair of pants.  Each girl's adventures while wearing the pants.  When I first read the cover, I wasn't sure if I would like it.  Then, I started to read it and couldn't stop.  This book will have you hooked.  You will wonder what will happen next.  Definitely a GREAT first novel from Brashares that is in need of some recognition.  I am hoping for a sequel.  You will love reading about the love, friendship, and security that come in these traveling pants.	2002-01-21

This book was good, don't get me wrong, but as a teacher, I can't think of a single child that I would give this book to to read.  I think parents would be banging my door down at school.  Not only was the main character sexually abused, he talks about it throughout the book (but not in detail...it's implied by what he says).  A pretty good mystery that I figured out early-on, may not be solved early by some readers.  Personally, I found this book to be disturbing and that is why I would probably show great reluctance to recommend it to kids in my classroom.	2001-08-11

My daughter received this as a Christmas gift and it has quickly become her favorite book, even at 9 months old.  The illustrations are beautiful and the text is rhythmic and lulling.  Every night, we snuggle together, just like the animals do in the book, and read this at least three times before bed, since she likes it so much.  I cannot think of another book that I have that will allow my 9 month old to sit still for ONE reading, much less three in a row.  This was a perfect gift and will be cherished for many years to come.  Definitely a must-have for children!	2001-01-21

I really liked the week-to-week pictures of what the baby should look like and the descriptions of what was happening to my body and what to expect at the doctor's office.  However, I must agree with some past reviews.  This book scared me half to death, which made me seem a little crazy every time I went to the doctor with a ton of questions in my hand.  It seems like the author wants to outweigh all of the good with what bad things can happen too, but to me, there were a lot of bad things that could happen every week of my pregnancy, without me knowing about them at all.<br />Also, I had to look things up in the back and then hunt them down in the book to read about them, since each &quot;problem&quot; is assigned a specific week.<br />The concept is a good one: look at how the baby is developing each week, by looking at a drawing and also how you should be feeling.  I still recommend this book to pregnant friends and tell them how much it helped me.  However, I think it would have been better if there had just been one chapter about things that could go wrong, instead of having a few things every week to worry about!	2001-01-01

This was my favorite out of all of the pregnancy books that I read while pregnant, and trust me, I read a ton of them.  This book was not only funny (unlike the other books) it was the ONLY one to tell me things that no one else had the courage to.  Like, what things would be like after the birth: the stitches, the mess, the whole &quot;not being able to sit down right&quot; sort of thing, that people just seem to keep to themselves.<br />I appreciated the sincerity of the facts, as presented in this book.  The author has gone through this a few times and really knows her stuff.  Not only was it a joy to read, it helped me to understand and cope with the new things that were happening to my body.  This is a book that is not to be missed by pregnant women.	2001-01-01

The best part about it is that she doesn't seem to care what other people think and she doesn't seem to even notice that everyone at Mica High stares at her.<br />This story, told by Leo, a junior at Mica, shows how one person can change an entire school by just opening up and being herself.  It is a wonderful story of friendship, acceptance, and of being different.<br />Leo falls under Stargirl's spell and is soon head-over-heels for her.  The only problem is that he is too embarrassed to admit it in front of the rest of the school, who seems to think Stargirl is not worthy of their friendship.  Stargirl is shunned by the entire student body, except for Leo and another girl.  Leo wants her to change and become &quot;normal&quot;, but should Stargirl give up who she is, just so she can fit-in at Mica?<br />This book was hard to put down and left me thinking about it for hours after I had finished it.  Definitely worthy of some awards and recognition (hopefully a Newbery medal), this book should be on everyone's reading list; young and old alike.  It is that good!	2000-11-27

Being found with her knife next to a dead man didn't do much to prove her innocence, but she swears up and down that she didn't kill Parnell.  Of course, she HATED Parnell, but that's not the point as she sees it.  She is very adamant about the fact that she wouldn't kill him.<br />This book goes through the entire story of Dovey's predicament and retraces the background leading up to the murder.  Was Dovey really jealous that Parnell proposed to her sister, Caroline?  Did Dovey want Parnell all for herself?  Or was Dovey just in the wrong place at a very bad time?<br />All of these questions are answered in this book, which is told by Dovey herself.  A little predictable, but a great read, nonetheless.	2000-11-10

Unfortunately, this was not the case.  Written for a younger audience, even youngsters with a good vocabulary would probably find this book dull and condescending, with its vocabulary lessons every page or two (if you haven't read the book, trust me, every other page there is a word that is given, along with is definition...this gets really old after the second chapter).<br />While I thought that the unfortunate events that kept happening throughout the book were funny, the book couldn't hold my interest.  I kept waiting for something more to happen.  Also, the whole notion of one's legal guardian trying to marry them really turned me off.  I thought that was quite repulsive.<br />For Dahl fans who liked the book Matilda, maybe this one will be sufficient.  However, I cannot give this book more than two stars.	2000-11-08

It is just as funny as the original, which won a Newbery Honor.<br />Poor Mary Alice!  She is sent to Grandma's house for a year, while her parents get back on their feet after the depression. In this book, Mary Alice is fifteen and can't think of anything worse than spending time in a tiny place, so unlike her hometown of Chicago.<br />This book finds all new adventures for Mary Alice and her eccentric grandmother, from the glue that will hold &quot;till kingdom come&quot; to the cherry tarts for the DAR (Daughters of the American Revolution)tea, the fun just keeps coming.  This book will make you laugh out loud and is a quick, enjoyable read.<br />Definitely a MUST READ for fans of &quot;A Long Way from Chicago&quot;.	2000-11-03

In this book, Forrest is not only a football player and a private in the Army, but he has many other adventures which include being held captive by cannibals and becoming a professional &quot;rassler&quot;.  The book is narrated by Forrest himself and while you're reading it, you can just imagine him saying all of it to you.<br />If you want to read a laugh-out-loud funny book, this one is for you!

This was my favorite book of 1997 and I can't help but feel like it was cheated out of awards.  Here, you have a great story about Tamar, a young king, who loses a dice game to a strange visitor.  Because he has lost the game, he has one year to travel to the other man's kingdom, where he fears he will lose his own life.  It is on this journey that all of his adventures take place.  This book has adventure, magic, and believable characters, while also providing a fast-paced story which will keep you reading just to find out what will happen next.

The fun starts when her evil stepsisters figure out that she MUST obey whatever they command her to do.  Poor Ella!  This book contains elves, ogres, evil stepsisters, and more.  It really is a great book and I found that I read it quickly...not wanting to put it down for even a few minutes (I read it in one afternoon).

If the story had been told from one character's point of view or if the story would have focused mainly on one character, it would have been easier, I believe, to really understand this book.  Instead, the narrator jumps back and forth, following four characters, brothers and sisters, over the course of a few weeks.  It was hard to remember which character I was reading about, much less care about the characters, who were not well-rounded.  While I am a McKay fan, I had great difficulty when deciding whether or not to continue this book.	2000-10-14

I received three copies of this book while I was pregnant, from other  women who already had children.  I was happy to see that the book answered  all of the questions I had and fully explained everything that I needed to  know, like what was going to happen to my body, what would happen at each  month's doctor visit, etc.  This book has a question-answer approach that  really helps, since they were some of the same questions that were floating  through my head (like, &quot;Will I have to have an amniocentesis?&quot;).  I went into labor before I could read the final chapters though and I  really wish I had been able to read those, about coming home and the first  few days, how I was going to feel and all of that.

Immediately, you are drawn to the characters and their problems.  I found this to be a hard book to put down.  Every time I did, I wondered  what was happening with the characters.  By the time the book ends, you  will want to read more about them.  An enjoyable read that only took me one  day!  I couldn't put it down!	1999-11-29
US	51847073	R1RFC6MPO39JM5	0805063145	428004728	The Mind's Eye	Books	1	1	2	N	N	Mind's Eye is a slow read	I am a Fleischman fan, but this book was a very slow read for me.  Not  only did it leave large gaps of time that were never filled in, but often,  it did not make much sense.  I found little character development and  almost no cues as to the setting of the book (other than the basic nursing  home scenario).  Had there been a little more background given for the  characters involved, it would have been easier to sympathize with them.	1999-11-29

This series of books, however, gets better and better.  During his third year at Hogwarts,  Harry must deal with the fact that an escaped prisoner is out to get him.  Will Harry be safe within the walls of Hogwarts? This book was an  entertaining read and kept me on the edge of my seat, even as an adult  reading it (you'll hear the same thing from the kids).  Believe me when I  say that we are all awaiting Harry's fourth year at Hogwarts School of  Witchcraft and Wizardry.	1999-10-27
US	51847073	R2EUR6QEWG5UK1	0439064864	667539744	Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets	Books	5	0	1	N	N	Harry Potter is entertaining for adults too!	While Harry Potter may have taken over the children's book market for the time being, let me tell you that it has also taken many adults by storm  also.  This book is definitely a must-read for people of all ages.  Harry  and the other characters come to life as you read the book, making this  truly an enjoyable tale for young and old alike.	1999-10-27
US	51847073	R87ZQ0WLRO47Z	0590353403	667539744	Harry Potter And The Sorcerer's Stone	Books	5	1	1	N	N	Harry Potter is a must-read for ANY AGE!!!!!	Okay, so I'm not in the age group that these books are targeted to, but as a teacher, I thought I'd better pick up the book that so many students were talking about.  This book was truly one of the most interesting and funny  books that I've ever read.  As Harry goes through his daily life, the  reader becomes involved to the point where one does not want to put the  book down.  It is thrilling and will keep you reading until the very end.	1999-10-16
US	51847073	R2U70RRW2AERXP	0385322496	587811494	The True Colors of Caitlynne Jackson	Books	5	4	4	N	N	&quot;Caitlyn Jackson&quot; will touch you	When I read this book in 1997, I didn't know that I'd still be thinking about it 2 years later.  The story is a powerful one.  Will their mother return?  And, if not, will Caitlyn be able to handle it?  This book is a  real page turner that will keep you reading all night (and thinking about  it for a long time).  Definitely a must read!!!	1999-03-10
US	51847073	R1H82O993SWG0J	0590424122	650034163	Somewhere in the Darkness (Point)	Books	1	1	2	N	N	&quot;Somewhere in the Darkness&quot; doesn't make a lot of sense	When I picked up this book, I figured it would be as entertaining and insightful as Myers' other works (like Scorpions).  However, I found this book to have a weak plot and other flaws.  The conflict was never really  resolved in the book.  How it ever became a Newbery honor book is beyond  me.  One plus was that this book uses realistic dialogue.  However, this  one thing could not save the book as a whole.  Let's just say that  &quot;Somewhere in the Darkness&quot; will leave you there; in the darkness  and confused.	1999-03-06
US	51847073	RK8E3R1YPJ895	0064405788	456502646	Wringer (Trophy Newbery)	Books	2	1	7	N	N	&quot;Wringer&quot; was a slow-read	I found the book &quot;Wringer&quot; to be a slow read.  It was hard to keep turning the pages, and this book was a Newbery Honor book.  The whole world of the main character is exaggerated, it seems, and he only worries  about what his so-called friends will think of him.  I have read several  Newbery winners and honor winners and I really can't figure out why this  was one of them.  It moved along very slowly and was hard to stick with.	1999-02-14
US	51847073	R2CVH9NICCO9NT	0789424908	670329572	The Islander	Books	4	1	2	N	N	&quot;The Islander&quot; is a good read-aloud	I am a teacher and I read this book out loud to my students, after first reading it myself, last November.  All of my students loved it and patiently waited every day for the next chapter or two.  We don't live near  an ocean, but it was not hard to imagine the sights and sounds, since they  were so vividly described in the book.  This is not the best book of 1998,  but it definitely deserves some recognition.  It was a good read and was  interesting.	1999-02-14
US	51847073	R37Z5JB7XRBUT7	0590897993	388998978	Bat 6	Books	2	1	3	N	N	Bat 6 was a confusing read	I was hoping for a great read when I picked up &quot;Bat 6&quot; in December.  I found it hard to follow, because of the jumpy narration (the book is narrated by 21 different girls). However, this book taught a very  important lesson about racism and how it affects everyone.	1999-02-09
US	51847073	R142BT0HP7H3UL	0803722907	88917561	A Long Way from Chicago: A Novel in Stories (Puffin Modern Classics)	Books	5	2	2	N	N	A Long Way from Chicago is a must-read!	&quot;A Long Way from Chicago&quot; was the funniest book I read in all of 1998, long before it was named the Newbery Honor book for 1999.  Basically, it is a story about the seven summers that two kids spend with their  eccentric grandmother.  It's full of laughs: from seeing a dead body to  catching illegal catfish, this book is a must-read for any person....any  age.	1999-02-09
US	51847073	R7IDYBIQ8XPO8	0805055827	817747652	Whirligig	Books	4	0	0	N	N	Whirligig is a good book for YA readers	I found &quot;Whirligig&quot; to be a good book, even though it was hard to follow at times (because of the narration, which jumps, chapter to chapter).  It details the perils of drinking and driving, in a way that is  easier for YA readers to deal with.  While I did not find this to be  Newbery material, it would make a good addition to anyone's reading list.	1999-02-09
US	51847073	R3I7PK6MR4PXT9	0374332657	159975375	Holes (Newberry Medal Book)	Books	5	0	0	N	Y	A must-read for any age!!!	&quot;Holes&quot; was definitely the best book that I read in all of 1998.  Not only is it touching, it is funny and anyone can relate to it.  I would recommend this book to anyone....of any age.  It's a great story (and has a  story within the story).  An EXCELLENT choice for the Newbery award.	1999-02-03
