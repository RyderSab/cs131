Blackbird House is a wonderful tour through history as experienced by families who all live in a Cape Cod house from the American Revolution forward. <br /> <br />As there is in the world, there is a bit of magic in this book. There is also love, grief, and family struggle. It's interesting how something planted generations ago remains to please or bother succeeding occupants, a metaphor for neighborly rumor or belief that transcend time and people's lives. <br /> <br />I highly recommend this book. It's short, but full of finely crafted sentences, and finely wrought ideas.	2005-03-01

That's why I read many of the reviews written here before attempting my own review.<br /><br />Ultimately, I didn't like the book. I could never understand, while reading it, how the author could remain so uninvolved in what was happening around her. Oh, she fought \\"wearing the veil\\" (but eventually wore it), she sat up nights outside her children's bedroom (preparing lectures!) while bombs fell during the Iran-Iraq War, she argued for intellectual integrity.<br /><br />But her students, mostly female, were far more brave in fighting against corruption and nihilism, some dying in the attempt, others imprisoned and raped. Nafisi's response to one such death is to dedicate a lecture to her.<br /><br />It was a very difficult read. Reading it was very slow as my mind would wander. I often didn't understand when she would make a time transition to some point in the past.<br /><br />I think the reason I didn't like the book was that it's really a story about a university professor who is good at escaping, into liturature, into a hallway, into a women's book club, and finally into American safety, when the bombs are literally dropping around her, when her students are losing their rights and their heads.<br /><br />At some point nothing matters except to fight back, a principle her students grasp more fiercely than Nafisi.	2005-02-13
US	52765693	RR64QGVYKOSY7	014029628X	180693945	Girl in Hyacinth Blue	Books	4	5	6	N	Y	Good Vacation Book	I wish I had read this before I read The Girl with the Pearl Earring. That book overrode any references this book makes with regard to Vermeer's genius.    But that is not to say the books are similar. It's just that, particularly in the final chapters, Vermeer's genius is too shallowly presented.    The Vermeer in this book is a fictional work, and the treatment, following its provenance back through time, is a worthy idea. How much do we wonder at the hands throughout time that have held a masterpiece? Consider how rapt we were at the history of The Red Violin.    Each chapter explores the times and personal hardships of its historical owners, but each owner, I think, is dealt with in a summary way. Each life could have been dealt with more thoroughly. But I found that one could easily leave off reading this at the end of a chapter and that's why I called it a good vacation book.    I also found that Vreeland used the painting as a sort of talisman, bringing good fortune to the good, and bad luck to others, with a couple of exceptions.    All in all an interesting idea, well worked.	2004-03-22

In the editorial review written above, the author calls Gabriel Allon \\"enigmatic.\\" I'll say! You can find nothing about this character's description, age, fears, passions (except for art restoration), what motivates him, whether he's strong, good, smart. Who IS this guy? Am I supposed to care about him and his cause?<br />Silva seems to wrap other stories that were done better (The Day of the Jackal) around his \\"secret! finally exposed!\\": that Pope Pius XII was silent during much of the Holocaust, and that Nazi war criminals escaped after the war with the aid of the Roman Catholic Church. Ooooooo. That is SUCH a revelation.<br />The other main problem I have with the book is the lack of action until most of the many, many characters are introduced. There are so many characters that I often had to page back in the book to see who someone was when they were later re-introduced into the narrative (Tiepolo, for instance). I don't think much action occurs until after you've read about 200 pages. And after that the action is spotty, not very exciting. There's no real tension built up at any point.<br />The DaVinci Code and Angels and Demons are much better books on similar subjects (not WWII or the Holocaust but evil within the Vatican). If you've read them and are looking for more on the same or similar subjects, I'd advise, keep looking.	2004-02-10
US	52765693	R11HTH0KWCDKW0	0312319517	604432126	Avenger	Books	2	5	10	N	Y	Forsyth has done better	Many people will buy this book, as I did, based on Forsyth's past successful writings. And perhaps he deserves to be rewarded for The Dogs of War, The Odessa File, and The Day of the Jackal. But buy the book on that basis, a reward for past efforts, not because this is a good read. Because it isn't.<br />Because the protagonist is American, and a lot of the narrative takes place among Americans or on our soil, Forsyth has a vehicle for presenting his political views, something I don't like in any novel, where one is able to present fiction as an underpinning for a belief system.<br />As for the story, Forsyth's ego as an insider privy to state secrets is laughingly portrayed. Republicans are heroes. Democrats are villians, or at least fools. And who hasn't heard of the tunnel rats of Vietnam, that Forsyth says are unknown to most of us. Heck, there's even a tourist attraction in Vietnam that takes people down into the tunnels.<br />But the most annoying parts of Avenger are those action scenes that work out JUST PERFECT for the protagonist. An area is searched except for the one place our hero is hiding. The villain takes a plane at just the right time. A friend is ordered into several positions to help out just where he is needed. A search is made among all embassies except the one where the fortunate hero gets his visa. A federal holiday occurs just when needed.<br />You'll find the rest of these many lucky coincidences if you are kind enough (to Forsyth), rich enough, and not busy enough, to buy and read Avenger.	2003-12-25

Lanie Schalbe has written an excellent review of Girl with The Pearl Earring. Read that review for a well-considered overview of the book. I would like to add a few points to her review: first, I found the main character, Griet, well developed and likeable. I didn't have any problem \\"getting into her skin\\" and seeing things as she did. However, I was amused at the way in which she kept her pursuer Pieter at arms length so long. I think that was a little unbelieveable. In real life, she most likely would have jumped at the chance to become his wife, even with his stained fingernails. It was a matter of eating well and caring for her stricken family.<br />Peripheral characters were not as well-drawn, particularly Griet's brother and sister. When they left, I couldn't sense the pain she must have felt.<br />When I was in The Netherlands, I was enchanted by the architecture and the canals. The architecture of the place captivated me. I wanted more of this backdrop for the scenes of this book, from the perspective of the author's art appreciation background. And street markets are lively and noxious at once. Scenes that occurred in the street market of Delft were fairly sterile in the narrative.<br />But those are minor considerations when stacked against the positive attributes of this book. Although I was familiar with some of the works by Vermeer, I knew little about the man, his time, nor of what it took to create even the colors of his painting (or of all paintings of this era). Just that was well worth spending time with this book. Previously, because of the typical subjects of Vermeer paintings, I did not rank him very high on my list of favorites. The author deftly brings a new appreciation of his art.<br />The life of a maid of the times was thorough and very interesting. The vivid descriptions of family life, and a maid's lot within the family, were the very foundation of the book.<br />The most sublime parts of the book, however, were Griet's coming to understand the genius of the man, and to even subtly assist him in coming to see what she knew he would eventually realize about his own works in progress. I say sublime because the author combines an intelligent young girl with her daily duties of placing and re-placing his settings after cleaning them, along with her history of long talks with her artist father. For me, this is the very essence of the book and explains her attraction to him, as intelligence is attracted to genius. And it, combined with the conventions of 1600's Netherlands, explains and makes acceptable so much of the author's beliefs about her subjects.<br />This is a very good read. Although some have called it a fast read, I believe it called for some relevant thinking about what exactly was happening to Griet, as the author wisely did not spoon-feed the reader her conclusions, but let us discover them on our own.and the genius of the man, and to even subtly assist him in coming to see what she knew he would eventually realize about his own works in progress.

Episodes of dying children are smarmy or corny, or both at once. Children outsmart and overwhelm seasoned soldiers who have far superior firepower at every turn.<br />Even the most egregious mistakes supposedly made by the Germans would not have enabled outnumbered and overmatched children to destroy a panzer division and hundreds of enemy troops, along with a German tanker.<br />I hope no one buys this book. I hope no one pays to see the movie. I hope people read Mila 18 by Leon Uris instead.	2003-11-17

And of the three, this is the worst.<br />I read with relish THE ARCHER'S TALE. Likewise, VAGABOND, though at times a little gruesome, had all the ingredients of an interesting historical novel: great battles, interesting characters, betrayal, redemption, evil churchmen, a quest, etc.<br />However, the first thing I noticed about HERETIC was that the visualizations were gone. With scant detail, I couldn't visualize the castle in and around which much of the action takes place, the face of the &quot;most beautiful woman&quot; they ever saw, nor any of the other people and places of the book. Cornwell gives one of the least visual descriptions of Yersinia Pestis ever.<br />And even though there was Thomas' usual love interest present (a different woman each time), no endearments passed between them.<br />What I most missed were the battle scenes. Oh, there were some but neither a satisfying number nor of the scope and pagentry that characterized those in the earlier two books.<br />Finally, you will have to read the first 2 novels in this series to understand who is who and why they are doing what they're doing in this one. In fact, I think a better course may be to read those two, and to wait until this one can be found in a used book store.	2003-11-03

I note this because sometimes, including this time, I order a book without looking at how many pages it is. This one was a surprise for me when I opened the box from Amazon.<br />The print is very small. I had to go out and buy magnifying glasses. It was either that or use arm extensions. I am very old though. The footnotes are even smaller, and the numbers of the footnotes are impossibly small. You don't have to read all of the footnotes. Some of them are just ibid's and idem's. But there is more interesting detail in some of them.<br />By quoting similar statistics about the same issue in the same paragraph, she seems to contradict herself until you figure it out and can move on, slowing down your pace. Note the \\"old\\" reference above...it may simply be me.<br />Other than that I found the book very interesting. As I talked about it with others, many asked to \\"borrow\\" it after I completed it. I find this a little bothersome sometimes, don't you? You get the book back about half the time.<br />The chapters on Russia and America were the most interesting. The ones on Kitwik and India were the least. By far, the Russian chapter was the scariest. Had I read this book before going there last year I might not have gone. DON'T DRINK THE WATER, including ice cubes (giardia). I never drink water when I'm in another country. I find it safest to stick with beer, and bottled water to brush my teeth. Anyway, this was her best chapter by far (it's very long) giving a more human element than any other chapter and far more interesting detail about everyday life for some. It was the chapter that made me want to send money to someone, especially that woman and her ill son. Sometimes I just have to put myself between children and odds bigger than they. It's the father instinct in me.<br />The book was written before 9/11 and I kept wondering, when reading the American chapter, what difference that would have made in her narrative. Oh, and I'll never doubt soldiers who complain of things like Gulf War Syndome again.<br />Remember when local health departments tested you for TB and other things before you could get a food handler's permit to be a waiter or a meat cutter or whatever, and they'd also trace one's sexual partners when one got treated for a sexually transmitted disease (note \\"old\\" reference once again)? They don't do that anymore. Our health department doesn't even care. I called them yesterday and asked them if I had an STD (not much chance of that anymore) should I tell all my sexual partners or would they. The answers? \\"Naw\\" and \\"NO.\\" That's interesting, isn't it? One, it suggests that the author is correct in that the government is betraying us in matters of public health. Two, it suggests that I have way too much time on my hands.	2003-10-29

Sonchai, too, is a character study of a man having solid values and beliefs that are melded by experiences. Here's where the touching humor of the book is revealed.<br />I had no problem with what some consider an attack on Western ideals. On the contrary, it's our boldness, combined with a lack of understanding of other, and older belief systems that causes so much mis-communication.<br />At one point Sonchai says this is not so much a Who-done-it as a Why'd-they-do-it. And Bangkok 8 is exactly that. It's not your traditional murder mystery. And this vehicle allows the author to examine cultural differences among the various characters, Asian and American. It's very thought-provoking about lots of issues, from the sex trade to police procedures, to economic exploitation, politics, and international diplomacy.<br />That John Burdett can handle all of these issues adroitly in a single 300-page book is a tribute to his skill and tight-editing.<br />I read the book thinking that it was more a man's book. I guess I still think so, only now I'm a little less sure.	2003-09-16

It's consequently filled with shopping trips, sending out Christmas gifts to family, parties, etc., adding nothing to the plot development. The first-person narrator talks a lot about her lover but we don't even meet him until page 210 or so, and then their banter and gift exchange takes up a few more chapters. The book could easily have been half as long. <br />Most authors can give us rich character development without dragging us along on a character's inconsequential day-to-day activities. In fact, after learning so much about &quot;Blondie,&quot; the main character, and &quot;Mike,&quot; the cop, even to the point of including their penchant for watching Jeopardy! every day, I couldn't care less about these very self-absorbed people.<br />And as for plot development, so little progress is made on the case for so long that I wasn't much interested in the plot either.	2003-09-03

Whether you felt it was your duty to oppose the war and resist the draft, or you felt it was your duty to fight to uphold your beliefs at that time, or you were just caught up in something that as a young person you didn't fully understand, all of our beliefs and sympathies changed during and immediately after this war. But though there were animosities among us at the time, over time we've come to appreciate each other, and to forgive ourselves.<BR>     This is the message of Demille's very special book. Yes, it's a gripping story. And yes, it's difficult to make someone of a younger generation understand not only that deep place in ourselves that we know exists but that we don't want to visit. But through the vehicle of this story, DeMille performs this remarkable feat with Susan and, I think, for younger (than 45) readers.<BR>     I don't believe there's a better book with a more realistic view of that time and of this world, of present-day Vietnam and of our own government, and of the continuing mission that we all share: to care for each other and to watch our government closely.	2003-04-22

Dave is haunted by his mother's death at the hands of two cops in the late sixties and by what he is finding out about her. At the same time, he is discovering some disturbing facts about his wife Bootsie and his daughter Alafair (who until now has just been cute and vulnerable). Their past and present experiences with men who figure into Dave's investigations into both his mother's death and a hit man's killing spree present a chilling atmosphere to the narrative and an opportunity for Burke to explore more meaningful aspects of this family's inter-relationships than in his past novels.<br />Burke is able to invoke a thirties, Dashiell Hammett kind of feel or atmosphere to his books even though they are set in the present. He is so good at this that I kept having to remind myself to update my visualizations: that wasn't a '36 Lincoln a body was found in; the cruisers had light bars and not domed cherries; and the people were wearing modern clothes, not pillbox hats with rhinestone trim or straw boaters.<br />While I did wonder about how the Labiche sisters would ultimately be woven into the storyline, I came to realize that their story was a sort of justification for the book's overall theme, one that runs through most of Burke's books in this series, that justice isn't dispensed by the legal system. That corruption of the term justice has become a system that kills the powerless and mentally retarded to win elections, bankrupts those who come under its review, even if they are exonerated, plea bargains to the extent that a person stealing flowers in a park in one part of the country is doing more time than a murderer in another, and fails in its two basic missions: to keep order and to protect the public. Instead, justice is meted out, in a poor, but still in its most perfect, form, by parents and friends...and sisters.<br />The book is only about 341 pages but it reads much longer, as you savor the imagery that Burke paints for you, and the characterizations and simple thoughts that he invokes.	2000-10-19

Previously I said that my daughter and I share a love of  literature and trade books we like and discuss them. Ms. McCall suggested  her book, not for me, but for my daughter.<br />I don't know why people think  a man can't love a book that is filled with life's experiences, that is  sensitive and moving. At the same time this book is crisply written. It's  very easy to find yourself lost in the lives of the characters. I think  it's okay for a man, even in this politically correct society, to identify  with a young woman's hopes and needs. Perhaps a little more of that  wouldn't hurt anybody.<br />Any parent who has stood up around-the-clock with  a sick child can't help but pray along with Lucy, the main character, for  her young charge's recovery. Many of the scenes in the book reminded me of  various people in my own family: the wisdom and kindness that can be shown  by an eleven-year-old girl; the awesome courage of a very sick little boy;  the laying-aside of the aspirations of a late-teenage girl when  responsibility beckons...aspirations that are rekindled again and again  until they are finally realized; and love that transcends death.<br />I  hesitate to even whisper the name William Faulkner (shhhh), but, darn it,  her characters are evocative of those found in Faulkner's works. He didn't  mine all the gold in those shafts.<br />I highly recommend this book. Ms.  McCall is an author who will find her name mentioned among this country's  greatest. College professors will require that their students read her  books. I can't wait for her next effort.	2000-08-31

It used to be (before Amazon) that I would have to find his books in Canada or England,  if I happened to be there. Now, of course, he's quite popular in this  country. I love his Flashman series, and they have accompanied me on many a  vacation.<br />Mr. American contains his usual historical accuracy, though  it's not intended to be as funny as the Flashman series. Harry Flashman  shows up though, but in this book he is used to decry the folly of war, in  most of its forms, certainly that of WWI.<br />The title character is an  American who becomes an observer of the decadence of post Victorian  England, as well as one welcomed into it, as long as he is useful to those  snobs whose society he is invited to enter. Whether he is to be amusing to  King Edward, or to use his money to restore his wife's family fortunes, he  is brought into the swim, only to find that it is a shallow pool  indeed.<br />But along the way he comes into contact with delightful and  trustworthy characters, none of whom are of the upper class, and it is  these characters who make the snobs, by comparison, seem so feckless. Pip  is as wonderful as Samson is loyal and unperturbable. It is these  characters, and Prior and Thornhill, whom we are able to compare and  contrast with Percy, the Claytons and those who surround the King. Pip,  like most people who are positive and seemingly without a care, is in fact  very ethical, supportive of her family, and without guile. The others, in  their own ways, represent bedrock values and character, quite a contrast to  the carefree, unethical, and undignified society people.<br />I highly  recommend this book, for its sheer pleasure of reading it.	2000-08-18
US	52765693	RC8EV1ZS3R3A2	0399145990	217600181	The River King	Books	5	0	0	N	Y	Highly Recommended	...many men might pick up this book and think that it's a women's book, but do yourself a favor and read it, along with Practical Magic. She writes with a prose style that makes many other authors seem clunky by comparison, moving smoothly from one character to another. It's a style that allows her to examine issues from different standpoints, or to move tangentially, taking the narrative into a sub-issue. Rather than characterize her writing as a landscape, I'd say it compared well to a symphony.<br />Ms. Hoffman's subjects are quite moving. While death and love are her subjects, the possibility of love bridging the gulf between life and death is gently, subtly probed. In my own case, it's not minnows. It's red balloons.<br />A fine work; you'll find yourself looking up from the book from time-to-time and savoring the images she has invoked, and of loved ones living and dead.	2000-08-04

Evanovitch sets up scenes with a minimum of prose. Then she incorporates characters that are drawn amazingly well. These are people I've come to  know and like. And the main character, Stephanie Plum, bounty hunter, is  just as wacky as everyone else.<br />Her writing is crisp, never bogged down.  It's just a joy to unwrap another of Janet Evanovitch's Stephanie Plum  novels, and sit down to read it before someone in my family grabs it and  hides it.<br />I just decided, while I wait for her seventh novel in this  series, to go back and read the first five again.	2000-06-29

Lincoln is his old charming and brilliant self, even in an area he knows little about, rural North Carolina. His instructions to his field agent, Amelia Sachs, while she tracks their  quarry through swamp country, are impeccable yet believable and logical  (elementary, my dear Watson). The bug thing really works and hardly ever  made my skin crawl (a little itchiness is all).<br />And then, pitting him  against Amelia is a bold stroke. Who is the better forensics analyst? Who  has the better take on the crime? It allowed Deaver to explore more fully  their feelings for each other.<br />Read this book. They don't get any better.	2000-06-20

Action-packed, interesting characters, and a premise (a town full of semi-retired contract assassins, some of whom are cute little killers), that makes one want to set up a similar  neighborhood.<br />Alas, they're stalked by a half-mad head of a  quasi-official (U. S.)government agency who embarks on a lame plan to get  them killing each other. It's what they do, right? But unfortunately for  the nemesis, they TALK to each other, and their thirst for vengeance is  unquenchable as well as mandatory. <br />Throw in a couple of unlikely love  affairs (to the unlikely assassin-retirement-town thing) and you have an  unlikely, but fun, semi-long story.<br />The writing is somewhat stiff in that  Maxim makes abundant use of the one-sentence explanatory paragraph at the  end of longer explanations. Apparantly he doesn't trust us to understand  what he meant in the longer paragraph.<br />All-in-all though, I'd recommend  it with this proviso: that you do not also order THE BANNERMAN EFFECT,  which is the sequel to this book. In that one, the first FOURTEEN (sheesh)  chapters are devoted to a recap of this, The Bannerman Solution. And if you  think you'd just buy the EFFECT to get the recap plus another good story,  don't do that either. That story (Effect) never develops. He's just using  it to set you up for his next sequel, which might, in fact, be another good  one.	2000-06-20

This is no lie: The author spent the first 14 chapters recapping the entire storyline of THE BANNERMAN SOLUTION. I had to skim the first 135 pages to see that I didn't miss  anything critical to THIS story. Other authors can handle sequels. Why  can't Maxim?<br />The premise, that the government has developed a software  program that can predict what will happen if certain surgical strikes occur  among drug distributors and terriorists, and therefore, Bannerman's group  of contract assasins could instill panic and confusion amoung various  terrorist groups, is quite an interesting idea, but is it ever developed?  No.<br />Finally, everybody in this book speaks with Ivy League/New England  diction: all of Bannerman's group (hey, they could have picked it up in  Westport...) but also the tough New York cop, all of the Europeans,  including the Russians, and even the Jamaican drug dealer.  Ridiculous.<br />Buy The Bannerman Solution, and be sure to skip this one.	2000-06-20
US	52765693	R10UQH4ZNCA54Y	0385495846	437097764	Demolition Angel	Books	4	6	8	N	Y	Carol Starkey has a very bad attitude	Is it possible to like a book and not like the main character? I guess so, because I liked the story very much, but found yet another unlikeable main character in Carol Starkey.<br />So, she got blown up and died and was  revived, but lost her bomb technician partner/lover. I think someone should  explain to the author that (1) people who suffer tragedy are able to put  their mournful thoughts and angers in a box and be more than a pitiful,  one-dimensional person. Yes, the box is flimsy. Yes, anyone can open it.  But typically one can get through a day keeping his thoughts to himself and  appearing normal, not constantly jumping down everybody's throat; and (2)  when a man loves a woman, he is incapable of seeing her scars. It's not  necessary for the author to make her possible lover someone who is going  blind.<br />But the story, otherwise, is quite good. I loved how, through  police investigation, the puzzle slowly took shape. I felt as if I were  part of that intellectual endeavor, determining in which direction the  investigation should go, and fitting new pieces into the puzzle.  Nice.<br />But for those looking for action, especially the kind that Elvis  Cole and Joe Pike deliver, you'll have to look at Crais' earlier books or  wait for his latest one.	2000-06-12

A friend, a bibliophile, once told me, after I almost ashamedly told him that I read mostly mysteries, not &quot;real literature,&quot; that the best novels being written today are in the mystery field.<br />Parker proves  this is true. To be able to write this well, he has to have deep scars,  ones that he's picked open and examined again and again, ones that never  heal, only partly because he doesn't allow them to. At times he opens me up  and lets me see into my own heart, firmly turning my head toward my own  scars, barely healed.<br />Even though I didn't really like his main  character, Merci, and didn't often agree with her decisions, the prose,  often apart from the story, was so finely crafted, was so communicative,  that it carries the book into the realm of fine literature.<br />But I'm not  putting down the story. It's reminiscent of the old detective masters who  were able to weave old mistakes and cover-ups into present pain and  tragedy. Thus, Red Light works on two levels: the prose touches you and the  story resurrects the memory of the era of the best crime fiction  ever...Dashiell Hammett, Ross McDonald, and others. It doesn't employ the  cheap titillation of most 'serial killer' novels, nor the self-pitying  recovering-alcoholic detective series. Rather, it's a thoughful,  finely-wrought example of very good writing and storytelling.	2000-06-04

Where's the reality in that? Uh oh, I thought, this  was written by not just a cop, but a cop still employed as a cop. Sure  enough, Jeff Pate works for the NC Criiminal Investigation Division.<br />If  you want a good read in this same genre, try Jeffery Deaver instead.	2000-05-31
US	52765693	RFZKKTNOFN1FQ	0374120803	575060326	Charming Billy	Books	5	1	2	N	N	I carry this book in my car	When I looked up to see how this, one of my favorite books, was rated by customers of Amazon, I couldn't believe it only ranked three stars. Reading some of them was amusing though; it seemed people didn't realize that they  had been touched. One reviewer talked about how &quot;ordinary&quot; the  characters were, and he's correct. Though my family has Irish blood, we're  American through and through, but I nonetheless 'saw' my own extended  family in the book, much as Billy saw his family in the faces of the Irish.  But the reading about them cast ordinary events in my life in a new light.  Reminiscing became not a mere recitation of events, but a savoring of the  humor and the passion in an historical, motivational, and loving  context.<br />Alice McDermott in Charming Billy did this for me, and living  without understanding the context of my life that I've achieved and  continue to achieve since my reading of this perceptive book, would have  been far less rich.	2000-05-27
US	52765693	R2BNXN9F8XL7V9	0553569228	299316935	Fire and Fog: A Fremont Jones Mystery (Fremont Jones Mysteries (Paperback))	Books	4	3	3	N	Y	Though a mystery, more of an historical character study	This is the second Fremont Jones story I've read and I've found both books to be finely drawn character studies. Jones rebels against turn-of-the-century expectations for women, how they should dress, conduct  themselves, subjugate their aspirations and rights to their husbands (Gawd!  Are we twenty-first century husbands lucky or what?). As a result she never  intends to marry, embarks on her own business, lives independently, all as  a young twenty-something. In Fire and Fog, having to deal with the  aftermath of the San Francisco earthquake, along with sinister sub-plots  that surround her, she is remarkably resilient and tough, qualities I  admire in anyone, women and men. Nonetheless, she is not so tough as to be  unreasonably fearless, longing from time-to-time for the help from women  and men she has encountered, especially Meiling Li and Michael Archer, and  to some extent, Nurse Bartlett. This makes her all the more human and  sympathetic a character.      If I had a teeny problem with the narrative,  it was that, if she was going to make friends with a car, a Maxwell yet, I  wanted to know more about the car! I am a man after all and we like cars,  often imbuing them with human qualities ourselves, as she did. Also, I  thought the denouement was inexplicably one paragraph long, not that tight  editing is a bad thing. It just seemed that after such detail about the  characters, the earthquake, the ensuing fire, (and less the car) it was  surprising to find out the identity and motives of the villain or  villainess in a few lines near the end of the book. A somewhat unsatisfying  discovery. I guess it was like buying all the equipment for a mountain  climb, carefully assembling it, studiously putting it on and checking all  of the ties, and ropes, and straps, then climbing in a helicopter for a  ride to the top.<br />No, I didn't guess who the evil doer was, but perhaps  that's because I let myself be led by the identity of villain or villianess  in her first book. I can see how someone else though might be able to  ascertain the identity earlier than I did.<br />Consistently well-written,  though periodically poorly edited (Spell-Check isn't good enough!)I read it  quickly.<br />But you have to understand me: I get cranky if I don't have a  book going.	2000-05-21

Her confidence, ability and compassion have had the effect on me that I would  follow her directions implicitly, and never interfere with her  decisions.<br />Written by a man, many women authors could take some cues  about how to present a believable and competent woman character.	2000-03-07

Picton's comments that we are seeing  the future of the legal profession and courtroom shenanigans in Darrow are  astute. His remark that if that is so, he will be trying his last case won  my admiration.	1999-10-25

It's an insulting, annoying book with a poorly-conceived plot, cliched characters doing unbelievably moronic things, and a main character who  hates men. On the other hand, if you want to read a book about a  one-dimensional woman constantly arguing with men, asserting her rights  alternately not to be pulled into danger and not to be protected from  danger, who finalizes simply, \\"Jesus, men are idiots,\\" then for  you it's a page turner.    Iris Johansen is the queen on the one-word  paragraph.    Really.    Her list of characters includes a computer tycoon who has no  idea how to actually use a computer or any other form of technology; an  Atlanta police detective who seems to have the freedom to do whatever while  reporting to nobody, and who sees no advantage in protecting a chain of  evidence; and a White House-employed serial killer who couldn't be more  proud of himself.    In a cruel slap at parents who have lost children and  who would secretly love to have a comforting dream, a sense of their  presence, or even to slip into the ever-present madness that stalks them,  for just a glimpse of them, Johansen's main character carries on extended,  information-filled dialogues with her dead daughter.	1999-07-03
