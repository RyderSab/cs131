I hated every single flipping page of this overblown and overhyped crap that as soon as I finished it--and I stuck with it, so agonizingly long, right to the end--I tossed it in the woodburning stove and giggled blissfully as the pages curled in consuming fire.<br /><br />This book is not comedy, straight or black or slapstick or satirical.  It is not a work of genius or intellect.  It's a rambling screed by a rejected and untalented hack, pushing himself and his own directionless existence onto the fictional page.  It's a glorification of everything that's wrong with the America we're stuck with, sloth and waste and taking deep pride in the lack of ambition and calling it independence.  This garbage holds up lack of personal pride, absence of self-resepct and absence of personal self-worth as worthy attributes, something that is honorable to strive for.  It glorifies the marginal existence, and the conscious decision to live one.<br /><br />Make a statement for literature.  Buy a copy and throw it in the fire, down the sewer, into a chipper, in the recycle bin, please.	2005-10-04
US	52822254	RJJXBO6STYLTN	1879434016	722331163	From a Chinese City/in the Heart of Peacetime Vietnam	Books	3	5	8	N	N	An Interesting Adventure Memoir Stained by Orientalism	This book is an acceptable and quick read for the beginning student of Vietnam or Southeast Asia.  It is dated and flawed in some respects, but nevertheless captures some valuable observations of Vietnam and its embedded Chinese Cholon society in the period after World War II and before the massive American interventions in the 1960s.<br /><br />First, note the dates of the warm reviews-the late 1950s.  This book came out in 1957, from de Poncins' stay in Cholon in 1955.  Of course, this is the year after the crushing French defeat at Dien Bien Phu, the first clear indication that what was then a more or less regionalized northern insurgency was going to be much more than a remote colonial disgrace.  De Poncins was aware of this, and presciently predicts here that there will be more to come in Vietnam.<br /><br />de Poncins was a pedigreed aristocrat and comes across as such.  He was an adventurer and observer, with that restless wanderlust of the idle/privileged, a self-styled professional, although trained neither in sociology or anthropology.  You could call him a travel writer as well, but more correctly he was an instructive memoir-writer, undertaking difficult and unique travels and situations for consumption by the less-traveled.  He almost comes across as a dandy.  The back cover photo tells it all, de Poncins with his pipe, sitting jauntily backwards in a four-legged chair, in his herringbone tweed pants, tailored jacket and tie, with the pants tucked perfectly into his high wool socks.  He is our cultural, intellectual and moral better, and his travels and observations providing the reader with insights and experiences to enrich our sad, pedestrian lives.<br /><br />In this adventure he was looking for the \\"essence of Chinese motivation and behavior,\\" and it appears that he thinks he's found it, at least what he perceives as the \\"ancient Chinese culture\\" that existed outside of China after what clearly is his opinion that China was ruined and forever altered (as well as off-limits) by the 1949 Communist victory.  In Cholon he observes his surroundings and its population with delight and wonder; it's clear he is observing something totally foreign and new.<br /><br />Cholon was a Chinese city, very much like Malaysia's Penang.  More accurately, Cholon was an expatriate Chinese city, an offshore slice of Chinese culture and society outside of China itself.  Cholon apparently had retained most of its Chinese character, societal structures, customs, and attitudes, and it was this de Poncins came to study.  de Poncins' foreword-from 1955-describes Cholon as retaining the old culture and \\"old ways.\\"  I visited Vietnam and Cholon in 1997, and virtually none of this remains.  Yes, the script on the signs are Chinese, as is the language spoken among the residents, but this all takes place amid the Coke signs, the Energizer batteries and Fuji film for sale to the tourists, and the Western-logo'd trash choking the sewers so badly that every time it rains the sewage backs up ankle-deep.<br /><br />The book is filled with daily observations, from his shabby hotel room to the filth on the street, prostitutes, intellectuals, businessmen and hawkers, theater, medicine, and customs and practices.  He describes a funeral, the contents of a Chinese house, what it's like to get a haircut, and provides a very basic description of what he sees to be Chinese philosophy and cosmology, describing the eight basic elements, and how the Yin and Yang, when depicted graphically, \\"penetrate each other in undulatory and `spermatic' fashion.\\"<br /><br />Orientalism at best and racism at worst run rampant through the book.  Even \\"old China hand\\" Edward Robinson's glowing intro to this 1991 edition speaks of how \\"the energetic and frugal Chinese tend to monopolize the local world of trade.\\"  de Poncins' sketches, of which there are dozens in the book, are the easiest way to detect this.  In every one, the Chinese profile is unflattering and denigrating, with heavy brows, jutting lower jaws, the stereotypical buck teeth.  None of his portraits convey the intelligence or dignity of the subjects, or the respect of the artist.  At one point de Poncins muses, \\"What human species are they? . . . They seemed to be the word of a moon-struck Rodin . . .\\"  He specifically notes the \\"slits of eyes,\\" \\"terrifying bone structure,\\" describing a taxi driver as reminding him of a \\"Chinese torturer of legend . . .,\\" and another \\"like a circus monkey riding around a ring.\\"  This is disappointing and surprisingly rampant in a book from as late as the 1950s.  It betrays de Poncins' Western-oriented arrogance, his sheltered and aristocratic upbringing.  This fault stains what would otherwise be an enjoyable and easy read of a foreign traveler's memoir in a strange land.<br /><br />In conclusion, this is an interesting and easy read.  It's a simple memoir of a true foreigner, both to Vietnam and to China, an outsider attempting to observe and report in his own way on what he saw, for the benefit of those who could not do the same.  Although packaged as travel writing, it is no longer that.  It is now an historical sociological/anthropological observation, and an amateur one at that.  For the student of Vietnam and SE Asian history, this is a quick and entertaining albeit flawed read, providing context and observations on life in general in and around Saigon in the middle 1950s, near the end of the Diem era, as the insurgencies and conflict of the South began to give way to the larger North-South struggle which would rage for another 20 years.nd denigrating, with heavy brows, jutting lower jaws, the stereotypical buck teeth.

US	52822254	R1UEIVCG36ZH4O	9067181994	66568457	Memories of the East: Abstracts of Dutch Interviews About the Netherlands East Indies, Indonesia, New Guinea 1930-1962 in the Oral History Project Collection	Books	2	7	7	N	N	Ultimately, Hundreds of Pages of Frustration	This is a wise and positive purchase for the serious and active scholar and student.  It's also a devilishly enticing yet ultimately frustrating collection of unrealized stories for the casual reader, even one familiar with Dutch colonialism and Southeast Asia in the 1930s, 40s, 50s, and 60s.<br /><br /> The stated purpose of the book is so that readers \\"can have some idea of the scale and character of the collection.\\"  \\"The collection\\" is the tapes and assorted databasing and archives of the (Dutch) Foundation for the Oral History of Indonesia project.  The project itself was designed to address \\"what was life like in the final decades of Dutch colonialism and during the first years of Indonesian independence.\\"  The seven-page introduction is direct and to the point, and thoroughly describes the project's purpose, its methodology, and some of the clearly implied \\"why's\\" and \\"wherefore's.\\"  It's clear and concise, and tells what the entire project is about, giving a good feel for the massive scope, long term, and dedicated participation of the scholars and interviewees involved.  The introduction is just right.<br /><br /> The abstracts are the core of this book, 578 pages of single-paragraph synopses from 1189 interviews of 724 people who had been in Holland's \\"East.\\"  The first abstract is from a housewife who married a Dutch colonial soldier; the last is from a school teacher who taught a prominent occupying Japanese official how to speak Malay.  In between are stories of privileged colonial life, captivity, torture, deprivation, occupation, uncertainty in time of civil/revolutionary war, and above all transition and uncertainty.  The stories come from bakers, soldiers, businessmen, husbands and wives, spies, engineers, public servants, students, and hundreds more.  The scope is wide-ranging and highly varied, each abstract standing as a separate and distinct story, a non-fiction memoir.<br /><br /> Overall, the book is incredibly frustrating.  Each individual story is a window into a unique and fascinating life which, due to the necessary brevity of the abstracts, is closed as quickly as it opens, in an average of maybe twenty lines.  There are fascinating stories of death and heartbreak, family reunion, love, deceit, and conflict, but there is never any amplifying narrative.  The abstract is all there is.  The only way to complete the story is to learn Dutch, travel to the Netherlands, and sit through the original tapes, since not even transcripts were made of these conversations.  As I read through the hundreds of pages of hundreds of abstracts, with a new source and entirely new existence at least once per page, I couldn't help but wish for a genuine story, a beginning, middle, and end.  In almost every abstract the basic elements were there, but there was never any resolution, never any amplification.<br /><br /> The only real value this book and its collection of abstracts has is to the professional researcher.  This being said, the way the book and its information is arranged does not necessarily assist one bent on research.  There is a clear methodology to the interviews, and each source named, with a source number, interview details, and occupation and locational data in Southeast Asia.  But nowhere in the book is all of the hard data contained in the 1189 abstracts collated and organized into a tabular or other form to make it easier to search.  There is an index of geographical names, and there is a general index, as well as a listing of the proper names of each of the interviewees.  Where is the index of proper/personal names to complement the listing of the names of those interviewed--the interviewees are not the only individuals mentioned by name, not by a long shot.  There is no general thematic index, the most logical and common basic starting point for any kind of research.  The index of geographical names is sadly incomplete, with dozens and dozens of places mentioned in the text not included.  The same istrue of the general index, a pitifully paltry effort of only twelve pages for over 570 pages of information.  Dozens of places, concepts, persons, organizations, businesses, government offices and elements have failed to be listed.  The weak general and geographical indices, and the list of interviewees are not cross-referenced at all.  For an effort of this magnitude, and with word processing technology available 2002, there is no excuse for anything short of a comprehensive, detailed, and thoroughly cross-referenced grouping of indices.  This is especially egregious fault in a book that is so clearly geared to the serious researcher.  Short of doing extensive library/online research or even going to Holland to research the collection personally, this book should be the simple, accessible, and above all comprehensive entry point for further use of the overall collection.  No, this is not the stated purpose of the book (as quoted above), but making the data readily available to those who wish to take advantage is clearly a responsibility of those who undertook the project in the first place.<br /><br /> In conclusion, this book is best purchased and actively utilized by the dedicated researcher, the scholar and/or student who is actively engaged in the subjects touched upon by this oral history project (late Dutch colonialism, Japanese World War II occupation in Southeast Asia, Indonesian nationalism and revolution, and the early days of Indonesian independence).  This book sadly is not a good choice for a casual reader, even one who is interested in and well-read in the Dutch colonial experience, Southeast Asia, Indonesia, etc.  The casual reader will be increasingly annoyed and frustrated by the parade of hundreds of fascinating personal stories of adventure, tragedy, and triumph, brutally truncated into maddeningly short abstracts.he same is true of the general index, a pitifully paltry effort of only twelve pages for over 570 pages of information.

I got mine in 1996 , and am glad I did.  As time goes on, this book will become more and more scarce, so buy it now before the price doubles again in another six years.<br />Yes, it's expensive, but worth it.  This is an invaluable reference, a must-have addition to the library of any scholar of Southeast Asia.  The book is a gem, a wonderful combination of cartography, fine book binding, printing and production, and unique scholarly content.  For a person like myself who enjoys maps, fine books, and Southeast Asia, this book is a treasure.  This is a book that will be a family heirloom 100 years from now, and worth more than it's current  purchase price.<br />The book is large-format, measuring 12 ½ inches high by 9 ¾ inches wide.  But, it is not a massive or heavy book.  It's actually rather thin, coming in at only about 150 pages.<br />The introduction is interesting in that it goes on for 51 pages.  Pluvier simply uses the introduction to individually introduce each map.  He states that his book \\"by no means (should) be considered a survey of South-East (sic) Asian history.\\"  The introduction is very nicely cross-referenced, in terms of time periods and countries/regions.<br />Following the introduction is a brief alphabetical list of all of the rulers and governors listed in the introduction text.  Then follows a \\"selection of literature on South-East Asian History.\\"  Pluvier refers specifically to D. G. E. Hall's 1961 Historians of South-East Asia for pre-European information.  The simple bibliography is very well done, providing information on historiographies, and is further sub-divided by modern country names, making it easy to find specific listings.<br />There are then two separate indices, one of personal names, and the other of geographical names.  Both indices are highly detailed and reference both the introduction as well as the maps.<br />Strangely enough, the list of rulers and select bibliography are not listed in the table of contents, so readers do not know they are there unless they happen upon them inside the book.  This is a minor editorial oversight.<br />The final portion of the book is its heart, a collection of 98 maps, diagrams, and charts in 64 pages.  All are full-color, beautifully rendered and easy to follow.  Note that the legend for each map is unique to that map alone; there is no overarching legend for all of the maps.  Therefore, the reader must be careful to be familiar with the legend of the individual map in question.<br />In conclusion, this is a must-have reference for the Southeast Asian scholar, as well as a wonderfully well produced book to add to the collection of any lover of fine books.  But its price is close to prohibitive, and I recommend its purchase only for those scholars who definitely will have reason to use it and appreciate it on a regular basis.bibliography are not listed in the table of contents, so readers do not know they are there unless they happen upon them inside the book.

US	52822254	R1IGFUDOSRBZ2P	9837203315	178460477	The politics and governments of South East Asia	Books	4	1	1	N	N	A Useful Basic Reference From the SE Asian Point of View	This is an interesting book, and I consider it particularly useful as it is a more or less comprehensive discussion of the modern politics of Southeast Asia, from the point of view of a Southeast Asian, specifically a Malaysian.  I also note a major drawback that this book is now close to six years old.  This being said, the majority of the subjects in this book are not necessarily influenced in a major way by the economic and political changes that have taken place in the past 5+ years; one exception is the 1998 and ongoing shift from Suharto's New Order regime to representative democracy in Indonesia.  I recommend this book.<br />The book is not scattershot, but does range widely, and not necessarily cohesively from chapter to chapter:  \\"Indonesia:  the New Order and Its Pancasila Democracy;\\" \\"Political Dimensions of Islam in SE Asia;\\" \\"Factors of Political Stability in Malaysia;\\" Comparative Study of the Party System in Thailand and Malaysia;\\" \\"Comparative Study of the Political Systems of Vietnam and Indonesia;\\" \\"Comparative Studies of the Judicial Systems of Malaysia and the Philippines;\\" \\"Comparative Studies of the Political Forces in Singapore and Cambodia;\\" \\"Comparative Studies of the Political Systems of Thailand and Indonesia;\\" \\"Comparative Study of the Level of Democratization in Myanmar and Malaysia;\\" \\"The Indonesia Political Party System:  Continuity and Change;\\" \\"Comparative Study of the Legislative Systems of Malaysia and Singapore,\\" and; \\"The Islamic Polity Under Dr. Mahathir's Administration.\\"<br />I note cynically the final chapter as a boilerplate nod to Dr. M's sterling, unwavering, noble, (insert your favorite complimentary adjective here) leadership to guarantee smooth publication in Malaysia.  This is not to say that the chapter is inaccurate, but given the preceding twelve chapters, which do not center their discussions on the tenure of individual political leaders, it is more than a little out of place.<br />For teachers, the chapters stand alone as useful individual pieces, ideal for extraction as single lessons, or as part of a larger sample.  The book as a whole is a good teaching publication as it offers easily accessible subject matter which ranges widely, reads easily, and contains easily discernible interpretation from the point of view of the Southeast Asian/Malaysian.  Thaib makes this clear from the outset, opening his introduction with the origin of SE Asia as a region resulting from the Western-/Anglo-created World War II Southeast Asia Command.  There are no glaring, daring, raging anti-Western statements in the book, but it does contain numerous comments and entries which make clear the difference between Thaib and his fellow Asians and the well-known works of Western SE Asia scholars Steinberg et al, DGE Hall, Tarling (ed.), etc.<br />A missed opportunity, or a springboard for a separate work is Chapter Three, \\"The Impact of Religious Beliefs and Ideologies on Political and Governmental Systems in SE Asia.\\"  Thaib discusses Pancasila in Indonesia, Islam in Malaysia, and \\"Confucianism\\" in Singapore, but does not address the role of Buddhism in Thailand, Myanmar, or Cambodia, nor does he tackle the fascinating mix of Communism and Buddhist approaches to hierarchical organization in Vietnam.  This chapter is short yet interesting, but could develop much further.<br />Thaib provides chapter endnotes for reference, and the citations are adequate and conscientious, ranging from 13 citations for a nine-page chapter to 169 citations for a chapter of 79 pages.  Thaib uses standard Western citation format.  He uses the notes primarily to cite his sources for facts and data, but also uses the notes to provide additional context or comment on specific issues, also providing references to the issue at hand.<br />Thaib's 8 ½-page bibliography is adequate, and represents a good sampling of the classic and newer works on SE Asian post WWII history and politics.  Thaib's SE Asian bent is plain to see, and the bibliography is a good jumping-off point for further study of the interpretations and views of SE Asian authors.<br />Particularly disappointing, especially for a professional/academic book of this scope, is the total absence of an index.  This forces the reader to use only the (relatively detailed, almost a simple outline) table of contents for quick reference.  Finding specific place names, proper names, and other subjects quickly is out of the question.  Future editions must contain an index, and its absence is a glaring editorial error.<br />Despite some of the negative comments above, I do recommend this book as a basic reference, a good basic teaching tool either as a whole or in part, and a good introduction to the alternative interpretations and views of modern SE Asian politics from its native citizens.and the bibliography is a good jumping-off point for further study of the interpretations and views of SE Asian authors.<br />Particularly disappointing, especially for a professional/academic book of this scope, is the total absence of an index.

This is the period after the Indianization of most of mainland and maritime Southeast Asia and the onset regular oceangoing capability yet before the arrival of Islam, closely followed by Western colonization.  The foreword describes the book as \\"a history of maritime Southeast Asia for world historians.\\"  The book is best used an introductory volume for 100/200-level university Southeast Asian history courses, as it is short (a total of only 121 pages), and is not heavily weighed down by extended academic context or discussion.  It moves quickly and competently through its subjects.<br />The book starts well with an introduction defining maritime Southeast Asia (and other terms and ideas) and describing the physical and geographic context in which the book is set.  Shaffer also describes the early influence of coastal China, the Malay sailors, and the overall ethnic/cultural seascape in which Southeast Asian maritime commerce and travel began.  Shaffer then follows with chapters on coastal China/Funnan up to 500 (CE), Srivijaya from 683 to 1025, central Java from 700 to 1025, East Java from 927 to 1222, and Singsari (1222-1292) and Majapahit (1292-1528).  She then finishes with a transitional conclusion on \\"the establishment of Muslim Mataram,\\" a brief discussion of the rise of Islam in maritime Southeast Asia and its wide-ranging effects, better studied and in greater detail in Anthony Reid's \\"The Land Below the Winds\\" and others.<br />The text is simple and easy to follow, and flows well despite Shaffer's use of parenthetical citation.  These frequent citations and other parenthetical references to figures and illustrations are very useful for the scholar, and do not impede enjoyment of the book for a casual reader.<br />There are nine maps and fifteen pages of photographs and drawings.  They are very good to put Shaffer's narrative into context, to get the flavor of Indian, Buddhist, Hindu, and other influences in Southeast Asia.  These illustrations reinforce the book as a good introduction to the early years of Southeast Asian history.  Some of the maps are quite rudimentary, and could have been much more clear, detailed, and annotated, but for the purposes of this book they are certainly adequate.<br />The bibliography is quite good, a great place for students to find additional references, a great starting point for research based on the book's subjects/issues.  At 7 ½ pages, it is a larger bibliography than one would expect from the length of the text itself.  It is good to see George Coedes, D.G.E. Hall, Anthony Reid, Laurie Sears, Nicholas Tarling (ed.), Paul Wheatley, and others cited.  Shaffer's book is a short-but not shallow-introduction, and this bibliography establishes her points of reference.  Knowing a number of these authors/scholars, there is some bias in their respective works, but nothing far out of the mainstream, and these references' arguments do not come through strongly in Shaffer's text.<br />The index is sufficient to reference the book, but could be better.  There are a number of geographical place names and proper names in the text and in the maps that are not listed in the index.  The text and titles of the illustrations/figures are referenced in index, which is a conscientious effort.<br />All in all, this is a handy reference for the Southeast Asian scholar, and it is a simple, straightforward, and non-intimidating book for the beginning student of Southeast Asia, or those curious about what the author says is a \\"neglected\\" region of world history.

US	52822254	RO9XY198SDXL3	0141001828	624836488	In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex	Books	4	1	2	N	N	Two Great Books in One	Heart of the Sea is two books in one, Philbrick's straightforward, fast-paced and highly readable narrative of the whaleship Essex, its death from a whale attack, and the resultant harrowing maritime survival tragedy, and the Notes section, where Philbrick cites and expands upon the facts, issues, and concepts touched upon in the main narrative.  This second part is a trove of avenues to explore, alone worth the book's purchase price.<br />The main question of the Essex is, \\"Did they get what hey deserved?\\"  Did the crew pay the long-overdue price for relentlessly the whale, for the wanton, careless destruction of whole species, for depleting a finite resource with no foresight or thought of conservation?  Did nature rear up and finally fight back?  The facts and other evidence Philbrick offers clearly lean that way.  The irony of the Essex's crew reduced to hollow-eyed animals sucking the marrow from their shipmates' bones after their numerous examples of careless, wanton killing cannot be escaped.<br />Philbrick writes effortlessly, comfortable with virtually all aspects of early 19th century  seamanship, whaling, even the demographics and cultural context of the early 19th century American maritime Northeast.  He describes Nantucket in detail, and the role its conservative Quakerism played in the whaling industry and in the Essex tragedy itself.  The basic story flows quickly, at times almost too quickly, as the central narrative takes only about 170 pages of the book's 302.  The other pages set the historical, economic, cultural, and sociological stages, and provide excellent epilogue.  I found the fast-moving story frustrating, as I was keen to enjoy in detail the voyage, wreck, and 92-day ordeal at sea.  For example, the Essex's struggle for \\"more than a month\\" to round Cape Horn is described in less than two pages, most of this geographic and historical context.<br />Upon reflection, Philbrick's story is constrained by scant available sources for the tale of exactly what happened during the voyage and after.  To his credit, he is loathe to blithely create fiction where he has no indication of what truly happened during the voyage and after the wreck.  He does make speculations, but they are informed speculations, and he is careful to discuss them with the reader as they are presented.  He does not embellish, nor does he fictionalize; he tells the best story he can with the historical information he has at hand.  This is noble, honest, and makes for a more compelling book than one in which fiction and truth would be harder to distinguish.<br />The narrative concludes with the survivors' lives after their ordeal, their successes and failures.  This almost puts a happy ending on the story.  Curious is the fact that many of the survivors were so open about their experiences, and in great detail.  Certainly this was an effort at explanation, and through that redemption, but what else lies behind this need?  It seems Philbrick's inquisitiveness and research fails a bit here, not exploring the psychology of why men would so freely admit to the greatest of taboos.<br />The Notes section of the book is highly detailed, and shows the depth of research and knowledge Philbrick brings to this work.  This is just a sample of things he discusses, things to explore:  early 19th century sailing, seamanship, and whaling; sperm whale behavior and anatomy; classic historical instances of disaster and survival cannibalism; \\"gastronomic incest\\" and \\"stomach masturbation;\\" Nantucket wives' use of opium and, uh, male anatomical surrogate devices; Samoan obesity, its relationship to ancient South Pacific exploration, and the advantage of being fat in a starvation situation; World War II starvation studies; \\"modern feral communities;\\" Japanese cannibalism cookbooks, and; the numerous links to \\"Moby Dick.\\"  Philbrick evaluates his sources, giving credence to some while dismissing others, providing justification for his conclusions.<br />One is struck while reading the Notes that this second narrative is actually a jumping-off point for any number of adventures.  This is a part of the book distinct from the straightforward story of the Essex, and a fascinating place to look for more things to explore, most of them non-fiction. The Notes serve to expand on some of the issues and stories Philbrick touches upon in the main narrative, but wisely has chosen not to burden the story with.  The citations of available books and publications are considerable, which could lead the reader in any direction, either fiction or nonfiction, scientific, biographical, historical, sociological, anywhere.<br />The book contains a number of highly useful maps and drawings.  There is a detailed diagram of the ship to explain terms.  The maps are particularly useful to gain perspective on the immense distances these sailors traveled.  There also are 16 glossy black and white plates, with drawings, photographs, documents,  and maps illuminating the story.<br />There is a useful ten-page select bibliography.  This is a bit redundant, given the Notes portion of the book, but it does provide a number of references and related materials which are not cited directly in the narrative or Notes.<br />At only seven pages, the index is disappointing, not nearly as detailed as it should be.  It fails to reference the book adequately, omitting a number of names, places, titles, and ideas.  For example, Philbrick makes mention of the 1996 film \\"White Squall\\" and the Piers Paul Read book \\"Alive,\\" yet neither is referenced by title in the index.<br />I note one niggling detail: Philbrick cites Read's \\"Alive\\" (and lists it in his select bibliography) and notes that it is about a Uruguayan \\"soccer\\" team.  It was actually a rugby team, not a soccer team.  This may be a minor mistake of fact by the author and/or editing team, or it may be that Philbrick has not delved nearly as deeply into his sources as his extensive notes and bibliography otherwise indicate.<br />All in all, this is a highly enjoyable book, first for its smooth and riveting narrative, and second for the unexpected trove of additional paths to explore.  Despite my one speculative, marginally negative comment above, I highly recommend this book.ruck while reading the Notes that this second narrative is actually a jumping-off point for any number of adventures.

The first is the straightforward Oahu North Shore story of Kimo and his desire to surf like his big brothers. To do so, he must learn patience and discipline, he learns that something attained comes through a process, sometimes long. There also is an opportunity to learn from his mother, and to gain the knowledge that parental advice isn't so far removed from kids. There are also a number of fun and educational extras inside.<br />Kimo asks, and his brothers make the collective decision to teach him to surf, and they do it together, as a family effort. But Kimo first must learn to swim. After all, surfing is an ocean sport, with the best waves usually quite a ways from shore, so swimming is a vital survival skill. So, first Kimo is taught discipline in learning to swim well, and with endurance.<br />Next Kimo must study the surf, the break of the waves, the movement of the water, so he gains an understanding of the waves he wants to surf, and so he learns the essential respect of the sea.<br />Then his brothers surprise him--he'd been concentrating so hard on his training, he'd lost track of his frustration--with his own surfboard. It's a family longboard hand-me-down, the same board they learned on. This is a great physical reinforcement of the family effort to get Kimo surfing, ohana all the way.<br />Finally, his mother offers advice from her younger surfing days. She teaches him the self-confidence he will need to catch and ride his first wave on his own, in front of the older, more experienced boys. It is, after all, his mother's advice which finally gets him up and gets him his first ride.<br />The illustrations are wonderful, with perfect color, content, and level of detail to communicate life in non-Waikiki Hawaii. There are a number of small inserts in the illustrations which are referenced with text at the back of the book that serve as teaching points for the flora and fauna of Hawaii. This is accompanied by a glossary of different things seen in the book, from Hawaiian plants and flowers to a recipe for banana bread, as well as a simple Hawaiian pronunciation guide. The front and back inside covers also feature a simple map of the Hawaiian islands to situate the story. These are very thoughtful educational touches.<br />I strongly recommend this book for all small children, whether from Chicago, Siberia, or Polynesia. Its solid, well-presented themes and lessons of family and personal development transcend surfing and the warm waters of the Pacific.e flora and fauna of Hawaii.

US	52822254	R1AZJE579VA9SS	0231123698	844685323	Conflict Unending	Books	5	13	17	N	Y	A Superb India-Pakistan Primer	Ganguly provides a valuable service with this book, an accessible, easy to read historical account and observation of India-Pakistan relations, in the context of their frequent wars and crises since 1947.  Credit goes to Ganguly for making a no-nonsense call on the source of most of the intransigence and crisis, Pakistan.  The reasons are numerous and different depending on the crisis at hand, and the discussions extensive (yet easy to follow), but Ganguly lays most of the blame for the ongoing problems between India and Pakistan at Pakistan's feet, more specifically at the feet of its arrogant, immature, and impetuous armed forces.  India certainly is not without blame both for creating and exacerbating tension with Pakistan, and Ganguly highlights this when required.<br />This is an excellent primer on India-Pakistan relations, tensions, and warfare since their mutual 1947 independence.  Ganguly discusses (by chapter) the 1947 war of independence/Partition (The First Kashmir War), the 1965 Second Kashmir War, the 1971Bangladesh War, and the Kargil Crisis/War of 1999.  He includes two very useful chapters on the seemingly unending relationship of crisis between India and Pakistan and the recently public nuclear dimension of the relationship.  This 2001 edition concludes shortly after 9/11/01 and its unfolding consequences, with some short personal observations and minor assessment from Ganguly, but does not benefit from a detailed analytical exploration of how the 9/11 attacks and their international political aftermath will affect the India-Pakistan situation.<br />The presentation of this extremely complex relationship is straightforward and simple, at least as simple as it can be presented and still retain the key aspects of the history.  Ganguly's narrative proceeds quickly, is easy to read and follow, and only briefly (in the introduction mainly) does he stray into dogmatic academic language.  His simplification and logical, flowing delivery of this complex subject is a major accomplishment in itself.  This is not to say that this is a dumbed-down history of India-Pakistan relations, not in the least.  His abundant citations illustrate his depth of knowledge on this subject, and serve as ample sources of information and reference for those who wish to pursue individual issues further.<br />Throughout the book Ganguly makes a logical and very clear argument that almost all of the bases for Pakistan's continued intransigence on Jammu and Kashmir, hence virtually all of the reasons for Indian and Pakistani animosity have ceased to exist.  Pakistan's assumed mandate of foundation, as a homeland for South Asian Islam, has lost its legitimacy through the various crises in Jammu and Kashmir and their outcomes, and due to the \\"loss\\" of Bangladesh in 1971.  Sadly, the outlook for tension between the two is not good, as Pakistan has come to rely increasingly on Muslim nationalism and its attendant creeping fundamentalism in order to bolster its essentially hollow claims to Jammu and Kashmir.<br />The extremely useful citations are in the form of chapter end notes, and reflect Ganguly's total familiarity with all major, minor, and related India-Pakistan issues.  This does require some distractive page-turning to get to the specific citation or additional point of fact as you read, but the end notes serve to maintain the smooth, flowing narrative.  Especially useful in this book are the appendices, a collection of nine essential documents from the history of India-Pakistan relations, including the 1947 letter of accession of Jammu and Kashmir, the 1972 Simla Agreement, and the 1999 Lahore Declaration.  These documents are crucial to understanding the more esoteric aspects of this enduring conflict, are cited frequently throughout the book, and the inclusion of them as appendices is very thoughtful.  The 14-page index is thorough and references almost all persons, places, events, issues, and concepts mentioned in the narrative.  Theindex does not include reference to any of the citations, requiring a thorough (and tedious) reading of them to derive maximum research benefit.<br />This is an excellent introductory study for any serious student of South Asian relations and foreign policy.  As such, I recommend this book for high school AP and college-level introductory South Asian/World Politics courses.  Its easy narrative and fast pace allow for quick absorption and general understanding without a weight of detail and context.  Not to say context and details are unimportant, Ganguly offers his copious citations for anyone interested in pursuing individual issues and opinions in depth.  For any casual reader on international affairs, this is a valuable introduction to the history behind and general current state of play in what is arguably the world's most dangerous flashpoint.index does not include reference to any of the citations, requiring a thorough (and tedious) reading of them to derive maximum research benefit.<br />This is an excellent introductory study for any serious student of South Asian relations and foreign policy.

US	52822254	R1JO6HO663BDGS	0061053147	5793806	Future Noir: The Making of Blade Runner	Books	4	70	74	N	Y	Minute Production Details, No Proof of the Film's Influence	This is a fantastic book and reference tool, and a must-have for any hard-core [[ASIN:B000UD0ESA Blade Runner]] (BR) fanatic.  It's packed with names, places, dates, fascinating factoids throughout, a trivia cornucopia.  But, you've gotta be a serious BR fan to stick with author Paul Sammon all the way through this densely detailed, thorough, and clearly personally meaningful work.  The book does have one major flaw:  Sammon's failure to prove his subtitle promise that Blade Runner is the most influential sci-fi film of all time.<br /><br />The book reads easily and well, Sammon's style informal.  He writes as one BR fan to another, a great approach.  The production details are thorough, insightful, and wonderful to read, 441 pages in 18 chapters, with nine appendices containing interviews, production details, the cast list, etc.  Sammon is a total BR devotee, I compliment and commend him on his achievement and the recognition of those who worked so hard to make BR.<br /><br />There is vast information throughout from all members of the cast and crew, all of them supportive of Sammon's effort to tell their story.  There is surprisingly liberal information from the movie's principals, Ridley Scott, Harrison Ford, Sean Young, Michael Deeley, Syd Mead, Hampton Fancher and David Peoples.  One disappointment is the absence of direct input and comment from the soundtrack maestro, [[ASIN:B000Z0OX9O Vangelis]].  Sammon nevertheless gives him thorough justice.<br /><br />Wonderful esoteric tidbits abound through the book, such as the revelation that the original lead was not Harrison Ford, but Dustin Hoffman.  Edward James Olmos provides great background on his preparation for his role as Gaff and his detailed construction of his Cityspeak dialog (most of it sadly unused).  We learn of fantastic special effects scenes never realized, and that in the background in one of the aerial city shots is a painted Millennium Falcon model.  We learn that the process of creating this movie was a years-long, highly personal effort, first by Hampton Fancher to secure rights and create a screenplay, then later by Ridley Scott and other members of the team who continued to craft the film even after they were fired by the production company.  It is a story of dedication to craft and art from a group of artists looking to raise diverse artistic, social, moral, and ethical issues with this genre-transcending film.  I often was reminded of [[ASIN:B000XECFXS Hearts of Darkness]], the story of Francis Ford Coppola's unending dedication to and struggles making [[ASIN:B000FSME1A Apocalypse Now]].<br /><br />Highlighted superbly in the book is the true key to BR's success, Ridley Scott's intense attention to detail, his relentless questioning of the larger context and physical placement of the story.  For example, Scott insisted on instructions painted on the futuristic parking meters in the street scenes.  Absolutely illegible in the finished film, this sort of detail nonetheless set a compelling, even subconscious tone for the set and those who worked within it.<br /><br />Particularly entertaining is Chapter 8, the scene by scene account of the shoot, with comment from the actors, producers, specialists, crew, and Scott.  Also very useful for the true BR fanatic are the appendices listing all of the various BR versions, their formats, availability, and catalog information.  Sammon does the same for the various soundtracks and musical compositions heard throughout the film, even the music and lyrics from the advertisements sported on the ad-blimps.  Especially enjoyable is Appendix C's detailed list of \\"blunders,\\" a compendium of the film's both obvious and subtle continuity errors, dubbing flaws, and inserted footage.<br /><br />There are dozens of illustrations throughout the book, and Sammon gives due credit to BR's still photographer for the hundreds of stills that BR fans know and collect.  The main problem is that the ONLY color photos in the entire book are on the front and back covers.  The B/W photos in the book are small, grainy, poorly reproduced, and do not reflect Sammon's praise.  These sorry photos do not allow the reader, who hasn't seen many of these never-before-published stills and production drawings, to revel in the details.<br /><br />Sammon is overly obsessed with cataloging ALL of the different versions of the film, and detailing the most minute differences.  We have chapter after repetitive chapter discussing the differences between the Workprint, the pre-release revisions, the theatrical release, the various video, broadcast, and satellite releases, as well as the competing director's cuts.  The fascinating core tale of the political, economic, and artistic fights over all of these versions of the film is lost as Sammon loses track and focuses too closely on the details of the different versions, obsessing to the point of irrelevance on miniscule details.  For the BR fanatic this is invaluable, but for most readers this makes the narrative tedious and repetitive, given this technical information is available in Appendix B.<br /><br />Sammon's promised discussion of BR's influence on sci-fi film is absent.  His subtitle, \\"The Fascinating Story Behind the...Most Influential SF Film Ever Made\\" promises a discussion of BR's influence on filmdom.  His discussion is poorly introduced, disorganized, and sorrowfully weak on supporting facts and testimonials, leading ultimately to the conclusion that BR simply is NOT the most influential sci-fi film of all time.  In fact, the paltry six-page discussion of BR's influence is one of the most shallow, most poorly researched and organized parts of the entire book.  Nowhere in the book does he cite any filmmaker, actor, editor, producer, or special effects artist describing BR as an influence. Sammon's strength and enthusiasm clearly lie in the film's production details.<br /><br />This book is an invaluable acquisition for any die-hard BR fan, and a great memoir for any student of filmmaking.  It's not for the casual BR or film fan; it's a cult book, just as Blade Runner is a cult film.  Disappointingly, Sammon fails to deliver a crucial element of his work, a thorough and convincing discussion of BR's influence on cinema and its place in greater filmdom.otos in the book are small, grainy, poorly reproduced, and do not reflect Sammon's praise.

The only real connection is the title itself.  It strikes me that someone creative and well-read in the Blade Runner film development came upon a phrase which just wouldn't let go, and that's how we got the term for the film.  But wait, this was the term in [[ASIN:0345404475 Philip K. Dick's original book]]--so who knows which came first...  Burroughs' description here and that in the film are similar in their urban and societal context, but that's about where they end.<br /><br />Reading this book, it strikes me that the producers of [[ASIN:B0000CNY27 Escape from New York]] read this novel, and took an awful lot of creative vision away from it.  This is especially true of the descriptions of a decrepit and decaying New York City, walled, populated by the dead, dying, and murdering, and where entire cultures flourish hundreds of feet above in the dead skyscrapers.<br /><br />Written in late 70s,  published first in 1979.  Set in 1999, or maybe 2014, or maybe 1984, or maybe any number of time citations Burroughs coughs up.<br /><br />Basically it's a futuristic nightmare, a technological hell in which the state has taken over all aspects of life, bureaucracy dictates every waking moment, and the medical institution is the vilest, most corrupt, most bloodthirsty, and most reckless of them all.  Underground and legit drugs, as well as designer plagues all vie in the marketplace.  Genetics are manipulated and diseases are voluntarily contracted for the material and physiological benefits the accrue.<br /><br />Inside this hell the blade runner is central.  \\"Essential to underground medicine are the blade runners, who transfer the actual drugs, instruments and equipment from the suppliers to the clients and doctors and underground clinics.\\"  The second half of the book, all two-dozen-odd pages of it follows Billy and his mates, blade runners all, as they fight their way through life on the street.<br /><br />If you're a Burroughs fan, you've seen it all before in [[ASIN:0312278462 Cities of the Red Night]] and [[ASIN:0312278659 The Place of Dead Roads]].

This message is crystal clear.  To Tierney's credit, his extensive, meticulous research and annotation, at times even distractive in its excruciating detail show just how serious he is about the pointed and refreshingly direct accusations he makes throughout his book.<br />Tierney's argument is extensive and lengthy, clearly fueled by alternating rage and conviction.  His knowledge of the area, its history, and the academic body surrounding the Yanomami is obvious.  But, to my reading his narrative is poorly organized, even rambling.  His detailed attacks against Chagnon, Neel, and others continue throughout the book, more or less chronologically, with detailed analyses and the debunking/disproving of Chagnon's studies and products continuing right to the very last paragraph on the very last page.  It seems to me, however, that the discussion of the US Atomic Energy Commission's Project Sunshine, the radioactive injection programs, the mysterious bone collection program, the encroachment of miners and other agents of plunder into Yanomami areas, and the tales of official corruption all would serve to be the bookends, the hard bands around a core of clinical and precise dissection of Chagnon, both personally and professionally.  But such was not the case.<br />There are a great many issues going on here, and Tierney's need to address them all dilutes his overall work....  Tierney attacks constantly, without letting up, only rarely giving ground.  To his credit, he does point out valid observations  At the same time, he goes after the corrupt politicians and their cohorts, as well as the US Atomic Energy Commission, journalists, and any number of other individuals and organizations which he asserts have had impacts-all of them negative--upon the Yanomami.  Many of these side stories are highly intriguing, worthy of additional research and publication, specifically the AEC's Project Sunshine and the bone collection program.<br />Reading the book gave me some insight of my own.  I'd argue that a better subtitle to the book would be \\"How Vanity and Commerce Devastated the Amazon.\\"  From the information provided here, what is clearly driving the academic exaggerations and falsifications, and the increasing, destructive contact with the Yanomami is the quest for personal glory and/or greed.  The scientists saw and still see Yanomamiland as a massive laboratory in which to make a global reputation, the locals (politicians and entrepreneurs) see it as a resource-rich region for exploitation, and the journalists regard the area as a made-for-publication, story-rich environment, full of newspaper-selling, viewer-inducing drama.  Unfortunately, all of this is true.  What comes through clearly is that the Yanomami are absolutely powerless, ultimately doomed, unable to even conceive of let alone competently oppose the forces conspiring constantly to exploit them.<br />In conclusion, the book serves three positive, educational purposes.  First, it provides a detailed and accurate, albeit distorted slightly by Tierney's passion, history of the discovery and exploitation of the Yanomami.  Second, it provides a cautionary tale on the nature of exploration and discovery, a real-world anthropological application of the Heisenberg Principle.  And third, despite its rambling, unfocused message, it offers a textbook method for a point-by-point, meticulous refutation and indictment of apparently false ...scientific research.  Tierney does not stoop to name-calling or insults; he retains the high ground yet ruthlessly, incessantly picks apart and destroys decades of Chagnon's and others' work, a lifetime of apparently wasted and falsified effort, all in the name of vanity.all of them negative--upon the Yanomami.

By the time the book's final words come, it's clear that it's the former.<br /><br />The story is interesting and moves quickly, just like its characters, but in the end there IS optimism and hope, and more than a hint of redemption. It is as sappy and syrupy as Chuck Palahniuk gets, but at the same time, this IS a happy ending.<br /><br />A thumbnail review somewhere else brought me to this novel. I was highly intrigued by the story of a med school dropout and general waste-case, a possible reincarnation of Jesus Christ who works at a colonial reenactment village and fakes choking in restaurants in order to make ends meet and pay for the upkeep on his institutionalized mother. Who could resist such a setup?<br /><br />And the story delivers. Victor Mancini is a fascinating character, as are his friends and their circumstances. Their stories go from there, off in unexpected and strange directions as Victor struggles with his past and resultant self-loathing, all the while knowing exactly where it comes from but not quite how to leave it behind. In the end, everyone matures a bit, Victor gets a mighty tough life lesson due to his own self-deception, and as we pull back and out on on the story, things are more or less looking up.<br /><br />In conclusion, I recommend the book. In the end, the weak but nevertheless positive happy ending wins out. I think it's clear from the book that if Victor and his crew truly were left on their own, the ending would have been seriously different. Overall, it's an entertaining story, a quick diversion, but to my mind not quite fully and honestly realized.	2001-08-29

Guy Grand acts immediately and directly on this premise, and the results are, on the surface hilarious.  But it is Southern's quiet, subtle, and expertly woven satirical narrative and incisive comment on 1950s America amid the vignettes of money-fueled chaos that are the true gems, and the heart of this wonderful novel.  The best example of this is the book's final lines, where Southern closes gently yet pointedly with a description of \\"the strange searching haste which can be seen in the faces, and especially the eyes, of (American) people in the (American) cities, every evening, just about the time now it starts really getting dark\\" (parenthesis added).<br /><br />A comment of this book is not complete without a nod to the [[ASIN:B00007GZQI 1969 movie]] of the same name.  Believing that most readers of this book will come to it by way of the film, I think there may be some disappointment.  This is no massive epic (the novel is only 148 pages) that had to be pared down for screenplay treatment, so there's just not that much more to enjoy.  Most of the sketches from the movie are directly out of the book, the only real change being the story's placement in late 1960s mod Britain, not 1950s Eisenhower-Middle America.  This change of venue works very, very well for the film, with its English cast and contributors, including lead Peter Sellers, hippie Beatle Ringo Starr, Monty Python studs John Cleese and Graham Chapman, and ubiquitous party-boy Who drummer, Keith Moon as an addled nun.  The only thing missing from the film is the novel's quiet satire.	2001-02-28

Multiple readings will only raise more questions, and/or cause you to rethink the conclusions you've previously thought solid.  Merely for the fact that this is a book that makes one think and ponder and consider, it is a great book.<br />The basic story is that of a WWII bomber crewman shot down over Tokyo immediately prior to the great firebomb raids of Spring 1945.  He is utterly alone on a hostile foreign island, likely listed as missing, presumed dead, with the book's opening pages promising a superior adventure as our protagonist struggles to stay alive and eventually repatriate.  But, as the story matures and we gradually learn more about Muldrow, we see that repatriation has been only a fleeting inspiration.  Mudrow has been freed, and he pushes north toward a place that is much more imagined than real.<br />As he struggles north Muldrow changes from serviceman to fugitive, from survivor to predator, from endangered hero to questionable protagonist to a perplexing and difficult-to-like principal character.  To my reading, Muldrow is an unpredictable, dangerous psychotic, with only the regimen and discipline of societal interaction and military service having kept him in check during brief periods of his life.  When in his element, out in the wilderness relying only upon himself, he is a nation unto himself, free to make any choice which suits his needs and his whims.  We see it in the flashbacks to Alaska, and we see it in his maniacal odyssey to Hokkaido and the White Sea, and to a mental and physical place which of course does not exist.<br />In the end where does Muldrow go?  This is as debatable as the nature of his character, the origins of his actions and thoughts, and his motivations.  Dickey takes us from a strong, pulsing adventure narrative in the opening pages to a lyrical, poetic, almost mythical climax as Muldrow finally dies/transforms/transcends.  It is a fascinating transformation for the character, for the narrative, and for the experience of the reader.  I wholeheartedly recommend this riveting, expertly written book.s a fascinating transformation for the character, for the narrative, and for the experience of the reader.

This book is valuable to the FZ fan as it takes a slightly revisionist approach.  The opinions are not always positive, and there are some unpleasant things said.  Yeah, the hard-core Zappa fan-atic might find this unpalatable, but there's nothing here serious enough to put the book down.<br /><br />This updated edition dates from 1996, and there is precious little this book tells about us about FZ in the years since the last edition.  What the reader will notice is that the book previously was published in 1972 and 1980.  It is clear that this updated edition has simply had the 28-page \\"I'm Not Satisfied\\" chapter added since the 1980 edition.  The chapter's opening sentence, \\"Frank Zappa's last thirteen years . . .\\" is a dead giveaway that it's an add-on.  As such, it just doesn't have any depth; the cynic in me sees a hastily-produced chapter put together to capitalize on interest in FZ after his 1993 death.  (The lightweight, 25-page \\"Cosmic Debris\\" chapter covering the 1972-80 period is also a lame add-on to the original 1972 edition.)  The years 1980-93 were FZ's most productive, most vocal, and most creative, and to sum up this period with a short chapter to justify an updated edition is just plain disrespectful.  There are also updates to the bibliograpy, discography, and clearly a newly-added \\"Zappa on the Internet\\" section.<br /><br />The book is best when discussing the early FZ/Mothers years.  Keeping in mind that this book was first published in 1972, it's not surprising to see that the first 150-odd pages of this 211-page book are devoted to this period. There are lots of great quotes, photos, and graphics such as old handbills and maps.  Lots of good information on the satellites in the FZ universe, such as the band members, groupies, the GTOs, etc.<br /><br />The layout makes this book an easy and flowing read.  It goes quickly, and is very much enjoyable.  Despite some of the observations made above, I do recommend this book.made above, I do recommend this book.	2001-02-26

It's an inside account for the fact- and tidbit-hungry FZ fan-atic, for those FZ-crazed psychos who have to know more than you do about one of rock's ultimate musical geniuses.  This book is written for the Zappa fan by FZ himself, and as such it is an essential addition to an FZ fan's collection.  If you've listened to your FZ albums to the point where you know the songs' lyrics, have heard/read some of the rumors and legends, and wish to expand &quot;your mythology&quot; and &quot;conceptual continuity,&quot; you're ready.<br />FZ's music leads the way, as it should, and you'll either love it or hate it pretty quickly.  Reading up on FZ before you start listening to his recordings isn't going to help you, and more likely would serve to confuse.  This being said, this book is best for the FZ listener who has made the critical personal decision to become an FZ fan, and who wants to educate himself/herself a little bit more about the man who makes the noises come out of the speaker.<br />And this book is the best place to start.  As an (assisted) autobiography, this is the real deal, the observations, memories, and facts directly from the source.  FZ says himself in the introduction, &quot;...I do not think of my life as amazing in any sense--however, the opportunity to say stuff in print about tangential subjects is appealing.&quot;  The countless FZ web pages and fanzines contain all of the information contained in this book and then some, but this is the best place to start your FZ education.  FZ's dedication of the book to &quot;Gail, the kids, Stephen Hawking and Ko-Ko&quot; (the 'talking' gorilla) provide the very first indication that the reader is in for a better glimpse of FZ than you can get from listening to the sonic eccentricity of &quot;Billy The Mountain&quot; or &quot;Weasels Ripped My Flesh.&quot;<br />The format is essentially chronological, but wide open, free flowing, with quick jumps to new subjects as diverse as &quot;Jazz:  The Music of Unemployment&quot; and &quot;How To Raise Unbelievable Children.&quot;  There are lists, poetry, instructions, lyrics, interview snippets, letters, transcripts of congressional testimony, tables, photos, and wonderful illustrations.  The illustrations are fine, detailed and punctuating the text well, done by the mysterious hieroglyph-signature artist whose name escapes me.  What is surprising is that FZ couldn't get longtime FZ album cover artist Cal Schenkel to contribute his talents to the book.<br />The book is a great investment, a fine addition to an eclectic library, and a wonderful repeat read.ick jumps to new subjects as diverse as &quot;Jazz:  The Music of Unemployment&quot; and &quot;How To Raise Unbelievable Children.&quot;  There are lists, poetry, instructions, lyrics, interview snippets, letters, transcripts of congressional testimony, tables, photos, and wonderful illustrations.

More than anything it's a novelty, a fun thing to keep on your shelf, lend to a buddy, and from which to draw the perfect quote or phrase for your next dinner party with the Royal Family.  This being said, one has to recognize the impressive research and work done by editor Scheidlower; it is comprehensive.<br />Prospective readers need to keep in mind that this is a dictionary, and as such is structured exactly like any other dictionary, with all of the standard formatting and notation.  This makes reading this book slow and jerky, ultimately affecting overall enjoyment.  Interesting and useful within the individual entries are chronological notations, providing historical information on the origins and evolution of your favorite f-----g phrases.<br />The foreword by Roy Blount, Jr. provides the book a touch of literati legitimacy, but is ultimately rambling and unfocused.  Sure, it's interesting, but he's not saying anything we don't already know.<br />The book concludes with a far too brief &quot;Guide To The F-Word In Some Other Languages.&quot;  Inspired concept, extremely poor execution.  No, we don't need hundreds of pages exploring f--k in other languages, but if you're going to provide this little goodie, go the extra mile and complete the work.  Yeah, German, French, Spanish, Latin, even Esperanto, Hebrew, and Basque are listed, but where are Sicilian, Corsican, Boer, Swahili, etc.?  I've just gotta know!	2001-02-23

If you are to buy only one dictionary of quotations, make it this one.  An essential resource for the individual, home, and office.  Wonderfully varied sources, from the Bible and Koran, from modern times and antiquity, from English and foreign sources.  It is very easy to use, intuitive, with succinct and clear instructions.  The organization of the dictionary is also simple and straightforward, with alphabetical organization by source/author and major themes.  The dictionary portion of the book is also broken up well with boxed special sections, addressing such subjects as advertising slogans, last words, misquotations, sayings and slogans, toasts, etc.<br />The dictionary has  a comprehensive (283 pages) keyword index.  If you can't find your subject/theme/author/source/concept/first line here, it's not in the book.<br />There is also a very disappointing &quot;Selective Thematic Index.&quot;  The idea is excellent, but the execution is poor.  There are not nearly enough themes (44) offered for this dictionary spanning 841 pages.  Furthermore, entries in the selective thematic index and keyword index have not been reconciled.  For example, &quot;Administration&quot; in the thematic index yields 17 entries, while the keyword index lists only two.<br />Taken as a book for reading and consumption, it is fascinating, even if a bit dense.  There are gems on just about every page, insights into history, people, the sources' thoughts and movitavtions. Spurs to the reader's contemplation abound.  Admittedly, slogging through 41 pages of quotations from the Bible, 21 pages of proverbs, or 51 pages of Shakespeare can be daunting.  But then you will stumble upon the incredible &quot;We should therefore claim, in the name of tolerance, the right not to tolerate the intolerant&quot; from Austrian-born philosopher Karl Popper (587).<br />I heartily recommend this superb reference and enjoyable read.	2001-02-22

The book is a fantastic read, as well as a useful resource; reading it as you would any other book is the only way really to determine which quotes are your favorites and which you someday intend to use.<br />The table of contents has a very comprehensive list of subject areas, sometimes very esoteric, ranging from &quot;Ephemeral,&quot; &quot;Self-Made,&quot; &quot;Loyalty&quot; and &quot;Intelligence&quot; to &quot;Slogans,&quot; &quot;Taxation,&quot; and &quot;Wall Street.&quot;  The subjects are not internally cross-referenced, but there is comprehensive index of cross-topics at the end, as well as an excellent bibliography and index of names.<br />What struck me most about this book is just how many of these quotations could be easily interpreted or construed as offensive and/or insulting.  There is very little context provided to most of these quotes (although the citations are quite scrupulous), so it is difficult to determine the actual situations in which many of these quotations were born.  The responsibility lies with the user to determine the audience and all possibilities affecting how the quote might be received.<br />All in all, this is a fine addition to your private library--your company's library too--and a very useful resource for those looking for an intelligent way to convince, motivate, influence, or any other action conducted daily by a leader/manager.	2001-02-21

The organization is excellent, with an adequate list of themes serving as the table of contents.  Further aiding discovery of the perfect quote is an index of authors/sources, and a very well developed keyword index.  Both of these supplemental indices are a bit confusing, but not overly so.  They list the applicable theme and the numbered entry under that theme; there are no page numbers given.  It's a bit confusing on the first few uses, after that it is simple.<br />The book is a fun, quick read as well, dense (with its relatively small print) with goodies from John Updike, Cheryl Tiegs, Henry Kissinger, Frank Zappa, George Foreman, P. J. O'Rourke, etc.  I heartily recommend it.	2001-02-21

The surprisingly direct, pointed, unvarnished, and invariably insulting things said by the famous about the famous are absolutely fantastic.  Credit to author Green's and publisher Cassell's courage for faithfully reproducing these quotations, despite racist, anti-Semitic, sexist, misogynistic, xenophobic, homophobic, and borderline vulgar content.  But then again, these ARE insulting quotations, so what do you expect?  Keep in mind that this is NOT a dictionary of curses and abuse, so these insulting quotations are notable for their intelligence, wit, and insight.<br />The quotations are limited almost exclusively to English (British) and American quotations.  I don't remember any quotations specifically cited as having been translated.  I think the book would gain depth from relevant foreign quotations.<br />The quotations are almost all modern, that is dating mostly from the 19th century.  There are some older entries, such as from (English) King John, William Laud, Kings Richard II and II, etc.  There are a few entries from antiquity (Plato, Aristophenes, St. John Chrysostom, etc.), but not as many as I would have expected.  Although gone for a couple of thousand years, I am sure the ancient Romans and Greeks had plenty of unpleasant things to say about one another and other subjects which would still be relevant and amusing today.<br />Regarding this book as a reference, it could be slightly better organized.  There is no table of contents, but the index is extensive, listing quotation sources/authors as well as applicable subject areas.  It is well cross-referenced, with the primary entries being highlighted in the index in bold.  Some additional work, to include listings for source descriptions and the content of quotes would perfect the index.  Example:  Oscar Wilde is credited in a quote as an &quot;Irish author, playwright, and wit&quot; but there is no listing for this particular quote under &quot;Irish,&quot; &quot;playwright,&quot; or &quot;wit.&quot;rish,&quot; &quot;playwright,&quot; or &quot;wit.&quot;	2001-02-21

Lawrence, cited in the preface provides the perfect setting and tone for this fascinating and comprehensive reference.  The subject is universal, ubiquitous, whether we admit it or not.  Sex drives commerce, influences history, and plays a larger part in all of our day-to-day lives that most of us would be willing to admit.  This book explores it all.<br /><br />The quotes are set off and/or put into context by brief commentaries, which go very far to the understanding of many of the quotes.  The quotes are from all available sources, from the Bible, Plutarch, and Ovid to Al Goldstein, Andy Warhol, and Noel Coward.  The quotes themselves are absolutely riveting, some highly clinicial, others highly cynical.  There are the humorous, the base, the insightful, and the out-and-out ridiculours; you determine which are which.<br /><br />The book is organized very simply, with a subject matter table of contents beginning with \\"Abortion\\" and \\"Adultery\\" and concluding with \\"Virginity\\" and \\"Wedding Nghts.\\" There is also an index of quotation sources, so you can easily find a juicy tidbit from Mother Teresa, John Donne, Madonna, or e. e. cummings.<br /><br />This is a very enjoyable read, one which will open your mind and broaden your horizons through exposure to the points of view and humor of many, many others.  As such it is a superb addition to your collection, and an extremely unique resource for your next requirement to come up with an exciting, evocative, and in this case provocative quotation.	2001-02-20

The introduction and &quot;Brief History of Raised Glasses&quot; provides a brief, gentle, and highly useful education so that you can oh so suavely back up immediately any question or challenge to the quote you've chosen from this cornucopia of highly organized toasts for just about any occasion imaginable.<br />The illustrations are superfluous, but the footnotes are very, very useful.  At first glance a bit pedantic, they allow the user of the toast to speak (and understand) the traditional language, such as &quot;stook,&quot; &quot;murphies,&quot; and &quot;banns.&quot;  The different subject areas, plainly intuitive, and listed alphabetically in the table of contents include such further instructive chapters as &quot;Hints for Effective Toasting,&quot; &quot;Odd Customs,&quot; a &quot;Selected Toast and Tipple Glossary,&quot; and &quot;Skoaling.&quot;  The different subject areas are also modestly cross-referenced to each other, such as the entry &quot;see also 'friendship;' 'general;' 'guests'&quot; concluding the &quot;Hosts and Hostesses&quot; section.

These are fantastic references.<br />This volume is now eclipsed by the new edition.  Haven't yet seen the new edition, but I anticpate many updated and new entries since the 1990-92 work done on this still-useful resource.<br />This is not to say this book is perfect.  For a country as abbrevation- and acronym-dependent as Indonesia is, this abbreviation/acronym list is woefully inadequate.  This being said, a comprehensive abbreviation/acronym listing is not practicable as acronym dictionaries available in Indonesia are themselves hundreds of pages long.  What is needed is a much more in depth compilation, edited for use primarily by foreign students and scholars.<br />The map section is also disappointing.  For a reference costing as much as this does, the maps should be full-color glossies, better annotated, and more detailed.  The best solution would be fold-out maps to best show the detail that is needed to complement such a fine reference.<br />The dictionary portion is excellent, very well cross-referenced, with thorough entries for each item.  The numerous appendices are also superb, with leadership and governmental ministers listings for the colonial period as well as the post-revolution period.<br />The true gem of this dictionary is the 118-page bibliography, listing other references and bibliographies, works sorted by discipline and subject, as well as important periodicals and journals.<br />This has been and will continue to be an indispensable part of my Southeast Asia/Indonesia collection.  Although overtaken by the new edition, this is an unparalleled reference, an essential tool for the Indonesia student and scholar.	2001-02-20

These are superb resources.  Yes, they are expensive, but for a student/scholar they are indispensable.<br />The main drawback of this historical dictionary is its 1993 publication.  So much has happened in Malaysia and Southeast Asia since then:  the &quot;Asian Tiger&quot; concept; the 1997 economic crisis; the Anwar crisis and subsequent Reformasi movement; the  growth of Muslim fundamentalism and political Islam, and; Mahathir's and UMNO's flagging leadership.  A new edition of this reference is imminent, and I trust it will address all of these issues.<br />There are a few disappointing aspects of this dictionary.  First, the list of abbreviations/acronyms can be much more comprehensive.  The chronology is a bit thin; there are many events in the post-colonial era, especially during the Emergency and the Indonesian Konfrontasi period that, alhtough somewhat minor, really would serve to flesh out the chronology.  The maps are a big disappointment.  No, this is not an historical atlas, but if the maps are to be included, they should be full-page (fold-out would be even better), full-color, better annotated, and much more detailed.  Yes, such an improvement would raise the cost of the book somewhat, but if one is spending close to $50 on such a reference, a few more dollars would not be a budget-breaker.<br />The dictionary itself is fine, well cross-referenced.  The bibliography is superior, an indispensable resource for further research.  The bibliography is sub-divided into subject areas, which further aids in refining research.  I am looking forward especially to the new edition's updated bibliography.  The appendices and tables are also useful, albeit somewhat shallow and now dated.	2001-02-20

This is a Malaysian government and academic favorite, as was very quickly made clear to me, but not for its academic depth or the purely sholarly tackling of contentioius historical issues.  Quite the contrary, this book is a favorite due to its smooth, polished, there-are-never-nor-have-there-ever-been-problems approach to modern Malaysian history.<br />This is a popular book as it is a recently published history, which implies it is full of new research.  Not so.  A quick study of the source references shows precious little primary resources, and a great deal of secondary sources; the book is a collection of previous histories.  This is not to say it is worthless.  The book is indeed an adequate, up-to-date introduction to the basic issues and facts of Malaysian history, and as such is acceptable.  But what you will not find is anything even remotely controversial or unflattering about Malaysia and Malaysians, especially the country under Mahathir.  The thrust of this book is that all is well in Malaysia, all has been well, and the future is rosy indeed for all.  Tragic and unfortunate events are not addressed.  For example, the description of the politically-driven ethnic riots of the 60s is very poorly done, with the blame for the mob murders of  hundreds of ethnic Chinese apparently being placed upon the Chinese for starting the trouble in the first place (an issue itself in doubt).<br />The glossing-over of controversy is fairly recognizable throughout the book, which soon enough becomes a pro-Malay bias.  This eventually taints the book as a serious and balanced work of historical research, but keeps it on Malaysian bookshelves.  If it were totally unbiased, direct, aggressive, and unflinching in examining and reporting Malaysian history, it would also be banned there.	2001-02-16

It is my #1 favorite of all time, and likely always will be.<br /><br />Synopsis: Twenty-eight-year-old World War II B-25 bombardier Yossarian is faced with the prospect of death at every turn, and no one notices or cares.  Eventually he finds a way to do something about it.<br /><br />The book is wild, sprawling, seemingly out of control.  The non-linear format can be a turnoff to many, but if you stick with it, and just let the story unfold, it all makes sense.  The story comes together, page by page.  The payoff comes only in the final pages, but it all comes together.  Really.  It's also deeply, deeply funny, with an enduring humor that operates on a number of levels.  Although written more than fifty years ago, the language and dialog remain colloquial.<br /><br />One thing I wrote eleven years ago I still stand by: the book is about a man and men, set in a purely masculine environment.  The point of view is overwhelmingly male, and sexist, with every single woman in the book described in primarily sexual terms.  Yossarian admits to it on page 291, \\"...Everything reminds me of sex.\\"  Women exist in the story as foils for male action and as bases for Heller's editorializing. This being said, I would hope women reading the book gain some insight on general male approaches to and perceptions of women.<br /><br />So what is the book about?  There's a lot going on here.  Heller took more than ten years to craft it, its 443 pages edited down from the original manuscript's 1,000+.  It's about the nature and burden of conformity in the most conformist institution (the military) during the most conformist of times (war), and how that conformity--and unquestioning obedience--will kill you.  It's about the cruelty and inherent dishonesty in bureaucratic and hierarchical institutions, the inevitable corruption within capitalism, abuse of power, greed, deception, justice and injustice, heroism and cowardice, God and religion, and the manipulation of logic and language to legitimize a wrong, pronounce sentence or make a sale.  The book is about the loss of innocence and the concomitant loss of youth to age, awareness, and ultimately to mortality. It is about the value and vitality of individuality, about friendship, humor and sex, and how essential these are to sense of self, well-being, and how we relate to others.<br /><br />While the story and themes are powerful enough, Heller's writing itself is a pure joy, with such gems as:<br /><br />-- Yossarian under physical exam, his body \\"...drugged and derogated, dusted and dredged, fingered and photographed...\\"<br />-- \\"Hungry Joe was a throbbing, ragged mass of motile irritability.\\"<br />-- \\"...he was dead, a bleeding cinder on the barbarous pile whom nobody had heard in those last precious moments...\\"<br />-- \\"The clinging, overpowering conviction of death spread steadily with the continuing rainfall, soaking mordantly into each man's ailing countenance like the corrosive blot of some crawling disease.\\"<br />-- General Peckem's \\"martyred smile of sweet reasonableness...\\"<br />-- \\"...her hands lying in her lap like fallen moths.\\"<br />-- \\"...the crazy, craggy, patchwork canyon of crashing antiaircraft fire...\\"<br />-- \\"...the open-air theater, where the milky, dust-filled beam bursting horizontally from the projector slashed a conelike swath in the blackness and draped in a fluorescent membrane of light the audience tilted on the seats there in hypnotic sags...\\"<br />-- Major Aarfy's \\"...fustian, moon-faced ineptitude...\\"<br />-- \\"..the primal, powerful, rhapsodic instinctual rhythm of erotic ardor and abandonment...\\"<br />-- \\"...a howling, strident, onrushing cacophony of overwhelming sound...\\"<br /><br />And there's Chapter 39, \\"The Eternal City,\\" one of my favorite passages in the world.  It is a stark, shattering 14 pages in heavy, dense paragraphs offering grisly detail in which Yossarian treads the inferno, descending into and through man's unending inhumanity to man, realizing it has existed and always will exist, only that up until now he had been unable to see it.  The violence, cruelty and injustice cascade through the narrative.  Heller's pacing, structure and word choice in this chapter are the high point of this book.<br /><br />As heavy as this book gets as the story unfolds, there is a great deal of humor, and this books still makes me laugh out loud.  Its humor comes in all forms, clever puns, plays on words, turns of phrase, illogical actions, and at times the darkest and cruelest black comedy I have ever encountered.  It is a deep, thought-provoking book which still makes me laugh out loud after more than 35 readings in the past 31 years.<br /><br />Bottom line: this is a brilliant work of fiction, an absolute treasure, and I recommend it with all of my heart.tinctual rhythm of erotic ardor and abandonment...\\"  -- \\"...a howling, strident, onrushing cacophony of overwhelming sound...\\"  And there's Chapter 39, \\"The Eternal City,\\" one of my favorite passages in the world.
