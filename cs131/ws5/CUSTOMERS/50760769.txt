Andrei Codrescu is a poet, novelist, essayist, screenwriter; columnist on National Public Radio; and editor of Exquisite Corpse, an on line literary journal.  WAKEFIELD is the most recent of his five published novels.  As of October 2005, WAKEFIELD had not entered the USA Today top 150-bestseller list.<br /><br />The protagonist Wakefield is a middle-aged, ex travel writer now a successful lecturer who jaunts around the States giving ad hoc speeches for lucrative fees.  He lives in the Old Quarter, which is definitely the New Orleans French Quarter, although the author studiously avoids using real names for places, brands, companies or organizations.<br /><br />Wakefield has little contact with his ex, Marianna, even less with his daughter Margot, and has only two friends: Ivan Zamyatin, a Russian &eacute;migr&eacute; cab driver and Zelda, his best ex-girlfriend and travel agent.  Wakefield is comfortable with his minimal relationships.  He is uninvolved.  \\"I have no interest in people....I just want to be left alone,\\" Wakefield says on page one.  Indeed, as a youth, he specialized in finding forgotten spaces where he could hide and spy on the world.<br /><br />The prologue opens the story in the late twentieth century when Satin visits Wakefield's apartment and tells him it's time to go.  Wakefield resists.  Fortunately, this particular Devil is old, one of the originals, and his lower back hurts.  So, Wakefield invites him in and over a couple of drinks, Wakefield cuts a deal.  Ole Satinik agrees to give Wakefield one year more to find his true self, but he must travel and bring something that he thinks the Devil would like from each place he visits; he's not interested Wakefield's soul.  \\"Give me a break,\\" the Devil says.  \\"I'm drowning in souls.  It's a buyer's market.\\"<br /><br />Wakefield goes to the city Typical where he speaks on Money and Poetry (with a detour in Art) and makes love, to Wintry City where his lecture to immigrants at war is a long poem, to the West where he wanders the back roads and talks with the grizzled geezer at the Dead Mule roadhouse, amongst others, and makes love to the olive oil lady, and then to the city of rain where he declines Mr. Redbone's quirkiness.  And then he goes Home.  It seems Wakefield does have an interest in people, but he does want to be left alone, his true self.<br /><br />As the dustcover attests, WAKEFIELD is hilarious, comic, a journey in laughter, a tour de force comedy, a trip.  I snickered, smirked and laughed out loud.  But WAKEFIELD is more than a joke.  It is a sardonic essay on contemporary America.ve, to Wintry City where his lecture to immigrants at war is a long poem, to the West where he wanders the back roads and talks with the grizzled geezer at the Dead Mule roadhouse, amongst others, and makes love to the olive oil lady, and then to the city of rain where he declines Mr. Redbone's quirkiness.

THE FIVE PEOPLE YOU MEET IN HEAVEN has been on the USA Today's top 150-bestseller list since October 2, 2003.  It peaked at number one.  As of August 18, 2005, it ranked number 100.<br /><br />THE FIVE PEOPLE YOU MEET IN HEAVEN is a third person-limited narrative about Eddie, an amusement park maintenance man who, at age 83, is literally and figuratively crushed in body and spirit.<br /><br />Mitch Albom did not write about Paradise, but about a Heaven where five people teach you something.  Albom put Eddie in Heaven to wrestle with blame.  It is a Heaven palatable for atheists and agnostics as well as believers.<br /><br />In truth, Albom's story is not about the afterlife.  The lessons Eddie gets in Heaven are about this life, and it's a shame Eddie didn't get to read his story before he died.  Eddie learns that trivial acts can have tremendous consequences, that there is no absolution for hard decisions not matter the choice, that one's legacy is intrinsically woven with threads from the legacies of our predecessors, that fabric rent asunder might not be amendable, that love is indeed the most splendid thing, and finally, unavoidably, life has its oops and zoinks.<br /><br />Read this one before you die.	2005-08-23

For example, \\"as if\\" was first recorded in 1905, \\"score!\\" was popular among teenagers in the 1990's, and \\"hey, Abbott!\\" has not been used much since the 1950s.  That information might save a writer of historical or near historical fiction from making an embarrassing blunder.  Also quite valuable is the nine-page index at the end of the book, which provides a concise list of dialogue possibilities from aaayy to zzzzzp.<br /><br />For general use, I agree with Dennis Laycock's review that this is a good book for the WC.  For writers of dialogue, it's a handy reference tool.	2005-08-23

Although there is no publication date given in my copy of the book, Amazon.com lists it as August 2002.  The book's copyright date is 2001, and the author indicates he was writing part of it in June 2000.  Therefore, his comments on the state of the fiction publishing industry are as of the turn of the century.<br /><br />Mr. Maass wrote several novels himself.  The four found on Amazon.com he published from December 1982 through March 1983.  All are out of print.<br /><br />Donald Maass has the credentials, though.  In 1980, he founded the Donald Maass literary agency, a unique agency that only represents fiction.  That's twenty-five years of reading manuscripts.  In 2001, his agency sold over a hundred novels to publishers.<br /><br />Throughout WRITING THE BREAKOUT NOVEL, Mr. Maass includes excerpts from dozens of great stories to exemplify his guidelines for getting out of the midlist malaise.  These references do not bloat the text; they are useful.<br /><br />I have completed two literary novels that I decided are not good enough.  With a good start on the third, I thought it wise to buy WRITING THE BREAKOUT NOVEL.  It was.<br /><br />In chapter two, Mr. Maass writes that the breakout premise must have four elements: plausibility, inherent conflict, originality and gut emotional appeal.  He explains, with examples, precisely what constitutes these elements, but you will find concise, workable summaries like this list for his guidelines.  In applying this to my own work, I believe that I have the first three covered, but I could use some more of that gut emotional appeal.  Mr. Maass uses THE NOTEBOOK by Nicholas Sparks as an example.  I thought of THE FIVE PEOPLE YOU MEET IN HEAVEN by Mitch Albom.  Both have been number one best sellers.<br /><br />Mr. Maass writes, \\"Life-and-death stakes are empty unless they are tied to underlying human worth,\\" and he gives examples that make you realize that a plot with some relevance to society as a whole will attract a broader spectrum of readers.  I saw that I could add another layer to my story.  It may or may not breakout, but it is going to be better for reading this book.<br /><br />If you write novels, read WRITING THE BREAK OUT NOVEL.

This review is for the first Back Bay paperback edition (a Little, Brown and Company imprint) published in January 2001.  Originally published in July 1951, THE CATCHER IN THE RYE first entered the USA Today best-selling book list on June 30, 1994.  On August 11, 2005, after 389 weeks, it was still on the list in position 71.  It peaked at 19.<br /><br />THE CATCHER IN THE RYE is the first person narrative of Holden Caulfield, a 16-year-old boy going on 13.  It is December 1949, a few weeks before Christmas, and the Pencey prep school has just expelled Holden.  He is accustomed to that; two other prep schools have thrown him out.  He's not a bad boy, though.<br /><br />Holden tells us the story of what he did during his last day at Pencey and the few days afterwards.  He gives us glimpses into his past.  He tells us a little about his oldest brother D. B., about his younger brother Allie who died when Holden was thirteen, and his kid sister Phoebe.  But we don't learn much about his parents, which is perhaps what we need to know.<br /><br />THE CATCHER IN THE RYE is a masterpiece of first person narrative.  The author is never present; there is not one \\"telling\\" word.  Mr. Salinger lets the functionally illiterate Holden show us memorable places and vivid characters that we will long remember.<br /><br />The best part of this story is what happens after you finish reading it.  You are going to be very happy that Holden is not your kid, that he is not in your family, that you are not his teacher, not your responsibility in any way.  And then you are going to worry.	2005-08-17

Julie Smith has published at least 19 mystery novels in four series.  NEW ORLEANS MOURNING was the first novel in the Skip Langdon series.  The Mystery Writers of America gave it the Edgar Award for best novel in 1991.  There are now at least nine titles in the Skip Langdon series.<br /><br />Skip Langdon is a young, tall, white lady from a prominent New Orleans family.  Her father, Don Langdon, is a doctor, who no longer talks to Skip.  Her mother, Elizabeth, talks too much so Skip tends to avoid her.  Whenever Skip calls her yuppie brother Conrad, he knows she wants something because why else would she call him.  But you don't need close family ties if you have Jimmy Dee Scoggin, Skip's fifty year old, five-foot square hopelessly gay criminal lawyer landlord who hands her a joint whenever he waltzes through her door.<br /><br />Skip is a policeman with only two years on the New Orleans force.  It's Mardi Gras and the king of Rex, Chauncey St. Amant is on parade.  He looks up to wave at someone dressed in a Dolly Parton costume with balloons in her bodice and a two-gun holster.  Dolly shoots Chauncey St. Amant.  Skip knew the St. Amant family since her rubber pants days; she grew up with this uptown crowd, so she is temporarily assigned to the homicide division to help in solving Chauncey's murder.<br /><br />Julie Smith uses an above average number of names in her stories.  There are at least 117 named characters (including one dog) in NEW ORLEANS MOURNING versus fifty or less in most novels.  You might get dizzy with the rush of characters in the first ten pages, but by page 17 things will start to settle down.<br /><br />Julie Smith seamlessly weaves the sound, sight, smell and feel of New Orleans into this story.  It's more than a mystery story; it's a tour of The Big Easy.	2005-07-20

This review is for the first Washington Square Press trade paperback printing, May 1988.  Bret Lott has published story collections, a memoir, non-fiction and at least seven novels.  His novels are about insights into the journeys of ordinary people with difficulties that are about as traumatic as are own experiences.  THE MAN WHO OWNED VERMONT is Bret Lott's first published novel.<br /><br />This is a novel about marriages.  Cal, Carla and Rose's marriages have failed due to infidelities large or small.  But those rifts are peripheral.  The story is about Rick Wheeler, the first person narrator and protagonist.  Rick's marriage is in trouble because he flushed the toilet.  I understand why he flushed that toilet, someone had too, eventually.  But Rick should have talked about it first.  As in many marriages, Rick's problem is his inability to talk about his feelings.  Cal, Carla and Rose could not help Rick, except to remind him how much he still loved his wife.  It took Lonny, who was never married, to show Rick what he had to do while hunting frightened deer.  You see, Lonny is an old plumber, a fellow who knows a great deal about toilets.<br /><br />Bret Lott loads this novel with mundane, descriptive details.  When Rick makes a sandwich, the author tells about every item Rick takes from the refrigerator, and its color.  If a metaphor, it escaped me.  In the men's room, Rick unzips, Cal comes in and unzips, and then Rick zips and rinses his hands.  There is dialogue, which I can't recall, but the zips I remember, wondering if Cal forgot.  A more selective treatment of detail, sensuous rather than mundane, would make this a better read.  Still, it's a good story.	2005-06-09

The story begins when Mike Hansen hires Chanse on behalf of Mike's wealthy, in-the-closet partner who is being blackmailed.  But before Chanse can get the particulars, Mike is murdered.  Although Chanse \\"doesn't do murders,\\" he eventually untangles a conspiracy and solves the case.<br /><br />The plot is murder mystery light.  There are no convoluted twists, embedded clues or clever deductions.  Indeed, this story is mostly a look inside the New Orleans' gay community where muscles bulge, stomachs ripple and all shirts are one size too small.  Of the twenty-nine named males in this book, twenty-five are gay.  The seven named females, however, appear to be straight.<br /><br />Greg Herren tends to write in short, choppy sentences, which although not annoying, I did wish for some rhythm and variety.  And there are some startling inconsistencies.  Chanse leaves the airport at 7:00 AM and drives straight to the gym, then goes home and tosses his gym bag on the bed, happy that he had turned on the air conditioner that morning.  Later he bemoans the unpacked suitcases on his bed.  Paul, Chanse's partner, leaves a phone message that he will call from Dallas that night, but later we learn his last flight that night ends in Chicago.  Interesting that one-half of all three inconsistencies occurs on page 14.<br /><br />Although I am hopelessly heterosexual, I found the story interesting.  New Orleans is one of my favorite cities, I visit there frequently, and it is perhaps useful to have an apparently authoritative insight into Big Easy Gay.	2005-05-25

This small book with wide margins might take you as long as four hours to read, provided someone interrupts you frequently.<br /><br />On April 25, 1946, Lieutenant John Milton Sweeney, in a letter to his sweetheart, wrote, \\"You'd know what I meant, but how about the people who'll read this forty years from now in `Famous Letters of Famous Naval Heroes' compiled by Lt. J. M. Sweeny, USN (Retired)?\\"  John, a.k.a. Jack, married his sweetheart on July 26 of that year, and she bore him four sons, but he did not retire.  On November 9, 1956, while his wife was pregnant with their forth child, Emma Sweeney, his plane plunged into the Atlantic killing all aboard.<br /><br />Lt. Sweeney met his sweetheart on December 29, 1945.  They dated for the next eleven days and then Jack shipped out to the Pacific.  During the next six months, he courted and won his girl through forty-five poignant and sometimes humorous letters.  Shortly after Emma's mother died in 1985, just about forty years later, Emma Sweeney found those letters.  Through them, she learned about the father she never knew.

I decided to read it only because Amazon.com customers rated it five stars.  Although I was raised as a Roman Catholic, and at age thirteen spent a year in the seminary, I soon became disenchanted with, and largely disinterested in, organized religion.  Notwithstanding this bias, I'm glad that I read GLAMOROUS POWERS.<br /><br />The plot opens in Grand Chester England at a quarter to six on Friday morning, May 17, 1940 in the cell of Jon Darrow, who for the past seventeen years has been a monk in the (fictional) Anglican Fordite Order of Saint Benedict and Saint Bernard.  Jon is having a vision.  He interprets this vision as God's instruction to leave the order and embark on a new, unspecified calling.  Before Jon can leave, however, he must convince the Abbot General, Francis Ingram that his vision was a communication from the Holy Spirit and not an aberration of a disturbed psyche.  There follows a fascinating mental dual between Jon and Francis.<br /><br />This deep and literary exploration of psyches pervades the story.  Before each chapter and section, the author liberally quotes from the works of W. R. Inge, particularly MYSTICISM IN RELIGION.  Jon has mystical (glamorous) powers, healing powers, which Francis thinks are often nothing more than \\"parlour tricks.\\"  I thought of \\"Anglo-shamanism.\\"<br /><br />Although the story evolves within the institutions of religion, it does not tamper with faith or belief, so the reader need not worry about being upset by heresy or theological debate.  The author confines polemic disputes between Anglo-Catholics and Roman Catholics, Low Church and High Church, to ritual, and treats these as external conflict rather than internal struggle.  This story is not about religion, but about the psyche, with pervasive emphasis on the guilt and anger emanating from parental failures.<br /><br />Jon Darrow has problems, \\"dis-ease\\" he would say.  The larger than life character is Francis Ingram who unravels Jon's troubled psyche without revealing his own disturbances.  At one point Jon shuns Francis and mires himself into a muck of troubles, and at page 296 I made a note that the story was getting a bit tedious.  It revived, I thought, around page 339 with the return of my hero Francis.  Indeed, the acerbic and witty letters written by Francis to Jon are splendid examples of writing at its very best.<br /> <br />Jon Darrow has problems, \\"dis-ease\\" he would say.

TOO MUCH TEMPTATION is the 23rd single novel published by Lori Foster and was the first of her novels to make the USA Today top 150 list.  Since first published in 1996, Lori Foster has published about 34 romance novels and has participated in at least 18 romance anthologies with one, two or three other authors.  Eight of her novels and eight of the anthologies have made the USA Today top 150 list.<br /><br />TOO MUCH TEMPTATION is the first novel in the romance genre that I have read in decades, and I was pleasantly surprised to discover the genre, at least in Lori Foster's hands, has become very NAUGHTY.  TOO MUCH TEMPTATION is a fast, delightful, mindless read, perfect to get you prepped for a rendezvous with your lover.<br /><br />There are two copulating protagonists in TOO MUCH TEMPTATION.  Grace is a 25-year old virgin, a strong-minded and honest woman with a fuller figure, who promises to do everything her lover wants to do in bed, but not elsewhere.  Noah, her hunk, knows where a woman tastes best and prefers a generous cut of meat laced with suet wearing just a tee shirt and panties to a twist of gristle dressed in Prada.<br /><br />The plot, although titillating, is not otherwise stressful.  The protagonists are exemplary, responsible people who act as we ought to while having passionate, savory yet safe sex.  The bad guys are not deplorable and in the end, they too learn to be good.  It is a rosy, optimistic story for when, despite the dust under the bed, you're in the mood for love.  TOO MUCH TEMPTATION is a romance that passes the wet test.	2005-03-12

Mr. Raucher first wrote SUMMER OF 42 as the screenplay for a very successful 1971 movie of the same title.  He published the novel later in 1971.  It is one of his nine screenplays and six novels.  The author allegedly based this story on his experiences, and some of the characters have the real names of his acquaintances.<br /><br />Set on the fictional Packett Island, which is within a ferry ride distance from the New England coast, SUMMER OF 42 is a poignant coming of age story about a 15-year old boy in love with an older woman of 22.  It is funny and easy to read, although most readers may not recognize some of the household names popular in 1942.  For example, on page 6 the author compares his three young characters to Beau, John and Digby, which lost me.  Doing research, I discovered these refer to three brothers in the 1939 movie BEAU GESTE who joined the French Foreign Legion to escape a scandal in England.  Then, on page 10, he mentions Patty, Maxine and La Verne, which I had forgotten were the first names on the Andrew sisters who entertained the troops in the forties.<br /><br />I lived in New England during the summer of 1942, although I was six not fifteen.  Still, Mr. Raucher reminded me of my puberty, and the characters, stores and shopkeepers on Packett Island could have come from my hometown.  Yes, we too donated our spent toothpaste tubes for the war effort.  SUMMER OF 42 is perfect nostalgia.	2005-03-02

DECEPTION POINT is Dan Brown's third novel.  Although originally published in 2001, DECEPTION POINT did not enter the USA Today bestseller list until May 22, 2003, piggybacking on the popularity of THE DAVINCI CODE.<br /><br />DECEPTION POINT is a fast-paced, suspenseful techno-thriller loaded with did-you-really-want-to-know facts about the artic, meteorites, deep ocean phenomena and cutting-edge military hardware.  Research is Dan Brown's forte; his author's note states: \\"All technologies described in this novel exist.\\"<br /><br />As in the two other Brown novels that I have read, THE DAVINCI CODE and ANGELS & DEMONS, the author tries to pack the drama into an incredible, whirlwind, sleepless 24-hours, although in this one he needed a little more time to get from Washington D.C. to the top of the world and return, with a detour into the Atlantic ocean.<br /><br />If you enjoy thrillers, DECEPTION POINT is a good one if you face a long flight or otherwise risk hours of boredom and want a mindless read.  But for me, even after considering the genre, it was too far out with incredulities, conspiracies and coincidences.	2005-03-02

Ms. Wood has published 18 novels with another due out shortly.  VIRGINS OF PARADISE was Ms. Wood's third BIG novel.  Read all about this author at [...]<br /><br />VIRGINS OF PARADISE is a long novel that recounts the sociological changes in Egypt from 1945 to around 1992 by tracking the Rasheed clan, a wealthy and initially aristocratic family whose locus is a mansion on Virgins of Paradise street in Cairo.  Ms. Wood divides her story into seven parts, each one a significant slice of time in recent Egyptian history, and relates how the extensive Rasheed family fared through the social and political upheaval.<br /><br />The baseline is set in 1945 when, at the end of WWII, the British occupation disintegrates and the royal aristocrats reign, but there are portents of change.  Part two, begins on Black Saturday, January 23, 1952, when a mob destroys mostly British interests in Cairo and continues through July of that year and the exile of King Farouk, which precipitates upsets and tragedy for the Rasheeds.  In part three, in 1962, we see how the Rasheeds have coped with the sociological changes under Abdel Nassar.  For part four, the plot continues with the intricacies, secrets and crises of the Rasheed clan in 1966/1967 up to the eve of the six-day war.  Nassar dies in 1970.  Part five picks up the epic in 1973 after President Sadat has made some changes.  Here, the story shifts in part to Southern California where Jasmine (Yasmina), born in part one and disowned in part four, is studying medicine.  In part six, the story tracks both the Rasheeds in Egypt and the outcast Jasmine in 1980 and into 1981, when President Mubarak assumes control after the assassination of Sadat.  The plot gets sticky as the swirl of lives begin to converge and clash in part seven, in 1988.  The epilogue, sometime in the early nineties, picks up where the epilogue left the reader wondering.<br /><br />The western connection in VIRGINS OF PARADISE begins with Alice, a blond Brit who becomes the second wife of Ibrahim, the dominant Rasheed male.  Alice and Ibrahim beget Yasmina, who we meet in the prologue as a protagonist.  Written in the omniscient, everybody's point of view, there are many protagonists in VIRGINS OF PARADISE.  My favorite is Amira, the widowed matriarch raised in the old days when, once married, a woman never left her home.  But Ms. Wood takes us behind the veils and lets the reader grasp the values and the frustrations of the Egyptian woman in a changing society.<br /><br />This is character driven women's fiction at its best.  The eclectic cast of female characters, a virtual harem, allows for multiple scenarios, permutations on the plight of woman in a repressive society where she is circumcised at puberty, betrothed without her consent, excoriated if she does not produce a male, and can be discarded by her husband saying \\"I divorce\\" three times.  The several generations of Rasheed women allow the author to play out a spectrum of solutions to the female predicament.

My favorite is Amira, the widowed matriarch raised in the old days when, once married, a woman never left her home.  But Ms. Wood takes us behind the veils and lets the reader grasp the values and the frustrations of the Egyptian woman in a changing society. <br /> <br />This is character driven women's fiction at its best.  The eclectic cast of female characters, a virtual harem, allows for multiple scenarios, permutations on the plight of woman in a repressive society where she is circumcised at puberty, betrothed without her consent, excoriated if she does not produce a male, and can be discarded by her husband saying \\"I divorce\\" three times.  The several generations of Rasheed women allow the author to play out a spectrum of solutions to the female predicament.  VIRGINS OF PARADISE is an epic portrayal of women coping in a patriarchal society. <br />	2005-02-28

Charles Chaffee, is based on the experiences of the coauthor Malcolm Champlin during the Japanese invasion of the Philippines in December 1941 and the fight for Bataan and Corregidor in 1942.  Many characters are ranking military persons and politicians identified by their real names.  Most of the remaining characters and events appear to be the recollections of those who survived the horrors.  The places and dates of military battles are factual, and I presume the battle statistics are from military records.  This is the story of the brutal defeat and death of thousands of American soldiers, and many more thousands of Philippine soldiers, and the plunder and rape of Luzon by the Japanese.  Most of this novel is history; do not expect intricate plot twists or surprises.<br /><br />The writing in LUZON tends towards a journalistic documentary with the voice of someone who was there, someone who saw the green crap in the trenches and maggot infested bodies, and the atrocities.  To carry the reader through this horror, there is a love story, a thread of hope.	2005-01-31

He has published five novels.  Some editorial reviews cite THE BLOOD COUNTESS, copyrighted in 1995, as his first novel, although he published REPENTANCE OF LORRAINE in 1993.  Mr. Codrescu also wrote the words for Ersz&eacute;bet, an opera work in progress about THE BLOOD COUNTESS and the characters in his novel; the website Bathory.org/index.html has extensive information on the opera and the B&aacute;thory story.<br /><br />Ersz&eacute;bet B&aacute;thory, The Blood Countess, lived from 1560 to 1613 or 1614.  A reasonable account of her life is available at [...] which notes that, depending on the source, she murdered from 20 to 2000 young women.  In his novel, Mr. Codrescu mixes historical facts, medieval urban legends and his own inventions such as the CHRONICLES OF ANDREI DE KERESHTUR and a contemporary character, Drake Bathory-Kereshtur.  The novel alternates between alleged events during the life of the countess and Drake's first person narrative before a judge in New York City.<br /><br />The first thirty pages of the novel suggest a literary fantasy genre, followed by the hopeful narrative of Drake, and then medieval intrigue with placid gore and limp erotica.  There are hints of interesting stuff: the judge seems to have the hots for Drake, Susanna Forgach lives openly with her lover, Benezzo Gozzoli searches for his father, but alas, the author does not conclude any of his potential subplots.  There are over 130 proper names in this story, and the author tries to parallel two in medieval past and narrative present, but his effort escaped me.  At page 313, I commented \\"pointless drool.\\"  When I got to the remarkably dull ending, I decided that THE BLOOD COUNTESS was a temptation throughout, but ultimately a bore.y a bore. <br />	2005-01-26

DEATH TURNS A TRICK, first published in 1982, was Julie Smith's d&eacute;but novel, a mystery in the Rebecca Schwartz series.  The author wrote four more novels in the Schwartz series, cumulating with OTHER PEOPLE'S SKELETONS in 1993, which was her first novel to make the USA Today bestseller list.  Ms. Smith has written 19 mystery novels in four different series.  To learn more, visit the author's website, juliesmithauthor.com.<br /><br />Rebecca Schwartz is a never married twenty-eight year old feminist, Jewish lawyer in San Francisco who enjoys playing the piano.  The story begins, on that fateful night, when Rebecca is playing the piano at a bordello as a favor for Elena, Rebecca's client and one of four prostitutes who co-share the proceeds of the business.  Around midnight, the cops raid the joint.  Rebecca escapes through a secret passage in the bordello's basement dungeon, but she has to take along a naked senator who was tied to the bed there.  Rebecca and the senator get in a minor traffic accident.  The senator runs but the cops get Rebecca, who left her purse at the whorehouse and is driving Elena's car.  By the time Rebecca gets back to her apartment that night, there's a corpse on her Flokati carpet.<br /><br />The writing is tight.  Ms. Smith saves the sensory detail for the suspenseful moments when she wants to keep you teetering on the edge of your seat.  The plot is free of hairpin twists and ridiculous feats, and the coincidences are lifelike.  DEATH TURNS A TRICK is an unpretentious, fast-paced, fun read.	2005-01-18

This review is for the Henry Holt and Company paperback edition, 303 pages, reissued in January 1994 after Mr. Butler received the Pulitzer Prize for his collection of stories, A GOOD SCENT FROM A STRANGE MOUNTAIN.<br /><br />In late August 1974, on Wandering Souls Day, a Vietnam War vet named Kenneth returns to Saigon, bargains with a prostitute and claims his then six-year old son, Thanh, an urchin.  Kenneth renames his son Anthony James Hatcher and takes him to Point Pleasant, New Jersey where Tony has his own room with a soft bed, TV and computer.<br /><br />The wondrous rescue from the rancid and dusty alleys of Saigon doesn't go well; Tony cannot assimilate the affluent American culture or bond with his father.  He struggles for an identity.  He wants to be Vietnamese, but his eyelids expose his half-breed origin and he feels caught between two cultures, unable to blend into either.  And although Tony hears the echoes of his mother's moans with a rotation of GI's, and recalls her mannerisms that he now recognizes as drug addiction, fond memories of mom haunt him.  So at the age of sixteen, Tony runs away to become a street urchin again, this time in New York City.<br /><br />In the first 67 pages, Butler weaves Tony's recollections of Vietnam and the early years with Kenneth into the psychological turmoil of the boy's mid-teens.  The remainder of the story centers on Tony's struggle to survive in the environs of sleazy forty-second street and the Port Authority Terminal.  Butler's vivid descriptions of that pathetic environment in the summer of 1984 started to depress me and I began to despair waiting for the climax, which I suspect is precisely what the author wants us to feel before he finesses the five-star ending.<br /><br />Within the first three pages of this literary, first-person narrative, I recognized the author's writing voice from THEY WHISPER.  But unlike that novel, Butler arranged THE DEUCE into chapters and used conventional paragraphing.  THE DEUCE is an engaging, readable story.THEY WHISPER.

Norton & Company hardcover first edition published in July 2003, 401 pages.  This edition does not have a reader's guide.  DUE PREPARATIONS FOR THE PLAGUE is Janette Turner Hospital's tenth novel.  She also has published five collections of stories.<br /><br />This is a literary spy thriller about the hijacking of Air France flight 64 bound for New York from Paris in September 1987.  The narrative present, however, begins in September 2000 and focuses on two persons whose parent or parents died during the tragedy.  The story has suspense, intrigue, CIA agents, spies, code names, Arab terrorists, and technological revelation consistent with the thriller genre.  But unlike most thriller novels, it does not have a larger than life superhero/heroine, it does not require leaps of faith, and the plot does not terminate in the ridiculous or sublime.  This well written novel is both character and plot driven.<br /><br />For the first time in about fifty reviews that I've submitted, I just read the other customer reviews before finishing mine.  Interesting.  It appears that those who have tired of the thriller genre, which is gravitating towards formulaic ridiculousness before blissful ending, rate this puppy four or five stars, whereas fans of the genre, nauseated by literary aspects, upchuck two or three.  And there is one reader who finds the melding of genre and literary a blasphemous sacrilege, as ignominious as interracial marriage.<br /><br />I've two observations for the undecided.<br /><br />Many with an MFA in writing soak their stories in sensory detail, use pages to describe their settings with perfumed words, interrupt dialogue with a symphony of gestures.  Janette Turner Hospital is not one of those.  Her writing snaps, crackles and pops; it is explicit and purposeful.  She tells a story.<br /><br />On the other hand, Ms. Hospital loaded this one with classical references.  The quotations preceding sections are not a bother; read them or skip them.  It's the stuff within the story, the analogies and metaphors drawn from the multitude of literature that I've not read that embarrassed me.  So I looked them up.  Daedalus and Icarus, Scipio and Polybius are from Greek mythology, as is Odysseus and the sorceress Circe.  \\"Bloweth where it listeth\\" is from the bible (Jon iii 8).  Yorick's skull is from Hamlet.  Iseult, who fell in love with Tristan, is medieval legend, but Baal Shem Tov, the legendary rabbi, lived from 1698 to 1760.

THE FIFTH SUN won the third annual M&aacute;mol Prize, which Curbstone Press awards for a first work of fiction in English by a Latina/o writer.  The winner of the award receives a $1000 advance against royalties and Curbstone publishes the book.  The book reviewed, purchased from Amazon in the fall of 2004, has \\"Advanced Review Copy\\" printed on the cover.<br /><br />THE FIFTH SUN is the story of Mercedes, a poor Mexican girl.  Early in 1930, the Villalobos, a wealthy Mexican family, bring Mercedes to New Orleans, ostensively as a companion for their daughters.  On 10 December 1930 (page 40), Mercedes composes a letter to her friends in Mexico, which includes the phrase \\"In the year since I have been in Nuevo Orleans...\\"  Soon afterwards, Mercedes quits the Villalobos to work at the Mayfair Guest House, where one of the boarders seduces, impregnates and abandons her.  The baby, Nicol&aacute;s, is born on 29 October 1930, \\"nine months to the hour after he had been conceived...\\"  (page 59).  The chapter titles in THE FIFTH SUN include the year of the narrative present, but several are obvious errors.  Within the narrative, there are more distracting inconsistencies in the timeline.<br /><br />Mercedes struggles to survive the Depression, marries, and has two more sons.  In 1936, her husband sends her back to Mexico with the children.  In chapter sixteen, at page 171, when the author begins to describe Mercedes' miserable life in Mexico, I gave up.<br /><br />THE FIFTH SUN uses the omniscient point of view.  Within the first eighteen pages, the POV hops from Josefina to Mercedes to Trinidad back to Josefina then Mercedes to Blanco Villalobos to Garcia back to Mercedes.  The brief cockfight scene in chapter two gives the POV of both birds.  The characters in THE FIFTH SUN fight one another for voice and none, not even Mercedes, wins the melee; I did not sympathize with or despise anyone.<br /><br />There are 85 named characters in the first half of this novel, and the reader struggles to figure out which ones are important.  In a vignette, Manuela buys fish from Ettie Leonard and her twin boys Casper and Jasper, and the reader knows that Ettie's husband is Maynard, although Manuela never learns any of these names.  Connie Fasbinder has a minor role, but Calvin and Thelma, her father and mother, are just names.  Gottlieb, Joiner and Todd are boarders at the Lichtestein boarding house, each with a distinctive smell, which enables Chrispin, the near blind dog, to distinguish them.  Chrispin is also a POV character.  Inundated by names and points of view, I drowned.<br /><br />The author litters THE FIFTH SUN with Spanish words and expressions without italics.  Although I am reasonably fluent in Spanish, I found that the constant use of foreign words deprives the writing of rhythm and style.  The last sentence I read contained the words \\"curandera,\\" \\"mal de ojo,\\" \\"susto\\" and \\"empacho.\\"  I pity the non-Spanish speaking readers.<br /><br />I had hopes for this award-winning story in a genre that interests me, but it disappointed.<br />There are 85 named characters in the first half of this novel, and the reader struggles to figure out which ones are important.

ANGELS & DEMONS is Dan Brown's second novel, wherein Brown introduces his protagonist Robert Langdon, the famous symbology expert.  It is the so-called prequel to THE DAVINCI CODE.  Although originally published in 2000, ANGELS & DEMONS did not enter the USA Today bestseller list until March 27, 2003, the same date that THE DAVINCI CODE entered the list.  As of December 16, 2004, both have been on the list for 91 weeks, peaking at number 2 and number 1, respectively.  Brown's other two novels, DIGITAL FORTRESS (1998) and DECEPTION POINT (2001), piggybacking on the ubiquitous THE DAVINCI CODE, became USA Today bestsellers in September 2003 and May 2003, respectively.<br /><br />ANGELS & DEMONS is a fast-paced, hard-to-put-down thriller.  I forsook my wife, chores, food and personal hygiene until the last fifty pages where the plot becomes terminally ridiculous.  Brown uses every trick to keep you reading.  He even splits a suspenseful scene to introduce another suspenseful scene, which he suspends at the suspension point.  If you like thrillers, you'll love this story.<br /><br />Dan Brown's trademark is research.  ANGELS & DEMONS begins with an Author's Note telling the reader that the art works and architectural details described in Rome are precise.  This is amazing because the story involves four locations linked in a symbolic pattern, and each location has the common and unique architectural features to support an intricate plot.<br /><br />Like most novels in the thriller genre, ANGELS & DEMONS is heavy on the incredible.  And like many, this story overruns into an excess of tiresome plot twists.  Nevertheless, even if you like your fiction a bit more credible, you ought to read this book for its incredible research.	2004-12-20

Ecco Press is an imprint of HarperCollins.<br /><br />OYSTER by John Biguenet is the story of two rival families, the Bruneau's and the Petitjean's, who have the largest oyster leases in Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana.  Fifty-two year old Darryl Bruneau holds loans on Felix Petitjean's home and boat.  Felix is on the verge of default.  To avoid losing everything, Felix agrees to give Darryl his eighteen-year old daughter, Therese.<br /><br />Oops, Therese has other ideas.  She tells Darryl, \\"I don't get bought for the price on no damn boat.\\"  In one of the most engaging first chapters I've ever read, Therese irrevocably upsets her daddy's plans.  Go to the bookstore and read the first seven pages of OYSTER by John Biguenet; I'll wager that you buy the book.<br /><br />With masterful dialogue and just enough sensory detail, John Biguenet captures the sounds and feel of the oysterman's plight in the fall of 1957.  There are some rough passages, like Mrs. Petitjean's confession to Therese, and occasionally Biguenet goes head hopping with omniscient POV, but he never forgets that it's all about story.  This is a good story told well.	2004-12-17

In the narrative present, Claire and Tom, having more or less accepted their barren fate, contemplate the purchase of an old house in need of repair.  With the permission of the realtor, Claire and Tom attempt to appraise the property alone, but encounter Grady, the grandson of the owner and his retarded friend, Martin.<br /><br />That's the plot basis for 173 pages, which provides opportunity for digressions on the humane treatment of rabbits for scientific enlightenment (although accidents happen), and the divining technique of a retarded savant for finding rotted clapboards.  The writing is beautiful, although bogged with sensory detail overload, my pet peeve, and there are rich analogies, although I'm too thickheaded to grasp them.  For example, on page 92 the protagonist Claire, on tip toes, bends a branch and plucks a leaf, which she rolls into a tight tube and carries for ten pages until, \\"The leaf, an even duller green than I'd thought it would be, lay crumpled in my hand.\\"  Get it?  I didn't.<br /><br />So why four stars?  Around page 174, I began to suspect I hadn't been paying attention.  It's a memorable tale, and a good one, but it requires fortitude.	2004-12-14

The 87 residents of Outer Maroo don't want \\"foreigners,\\" a term that applies to anyone not already in Outer Maroo, because they have something to hide: the ghastly happenings thirteen months ago at Oyster Reef, a religious commune.<br /><br />There are no oysters on Oyster Reef.  Oyster is the name the cult leader gave to his self.  There are opals there, though.  Oyster Reef is not a reef.  It is way out in the outback beyond the end of the rail line, off the map.  To get there, you'll need a four-wheel drive, extra petrol tanks, spare vehicle parts and a driver who knows the bush country.  Foreigners can't buy round trip tickets, however.<br /><br />The story begins when two foreigners, one from Melbourne and another from Boston, arrive in Outer Maroo, at high noon on Monday, looking for their young loved ones who were mesmerized by Oyster.  From there, the author cleverly interweaves story and back-story, gradually untangles her characters and ultimately unravels Outer Maroo itself, all in a week's time.<br /><br />OYSTER is the best work of literary fiction I can recall reading, and is more engaging than most of the genre and commercial fiction I've read.  The prose crackles, the characters are vivid, the pace is precise and there are tasteful flavors of suspense, mystery, sci-fi and spice.<br /><br />Janet Turner Hospital was born and raised on the steamy coast of Queensland.

In about two weeks, on May 4, 1984, Frank will be 39 years old.  Frank has been divorced for about two years, his X has custody of their two surviving children; the third died four years earlier from Reye's syndrome.  Frank enjoys being a sportswriter, and he is happy with his new girlfriend, Vicki, who he has known for two months.<br /><br />Enough happens to Frank to engage the reader in his story, things that might happen to any ordinary guy.  This book is not about plot, though.  It's about Frank's philosophy, which puzzled me for a while, it seemed murky, a little fuzzy perhaps, until I realized my own approach to life has been pretty much like Frank's, although I'm too old now to remember thinking about it if I ever did.  Then, in the end, Frank has a brief conversation with Catherine Flaherty that makes everything crystal clear, sharp as a tack.<br /><br />Ford investigates the nature of mystery, anticipation, literalism and factualism.  For example, Frank thinks \\"...mystery, first winded, then ruined by fact.  I would rather stay on the side of good omens, be part of the inexplicable, an unexpected bellwether for whatever is ahead.  Discretion, oddly enough, is the best response for a man of stalled responses.\\"<br /><br />As in many literary works, there is a bit too much sensory detail at times for my taste, and sometimes the long stretches of interior monologue within dialogue lost me; I had to go back and find out what the conversation was about.  But with Ford's superb writing, I didn't mind.<br /><br />Throughout dialogue however, nearly all the characters consistently inject the name of the person spoken to.  For example:<br /><br />\\"I came down through Pemberton and Rambler, Wade.\\"<br /><br />\\"Isn't it something, Frank?\\"<br /><br />This seems stilted, quirky and eventually as irritating as someone who must clear their throat every ten words or so.  If that's how they talk in Jersey, I'll stay afar, thank you, Richard.\\"<br /><br />Also in dialogue, there are frequent clever rejoinders, lovely literary twists; \\"jokey-quippy-irony\\" stuff (Ford p283).  Unfortunately, several characters are so accomplished, and therefore the voice that grabs is not theirs, but the author's.<br /><br />Overall, THE SPORTSWRITER is engaging and beautifully written.

During high school, Harley has an everyday girlfriend, Lynette, who he probably loves.  When Harley goes to college, though, he doesn't write or call Lynette, an everyday mistake for virgin boys.  After three months without hearing from Harley, Lynette starts screwing Doug who she marries and they have three children.  In the present time of the novel, Harley is out of college and back in his hometown, Lynette's oldest child is four, and Doug is apparently abusing Lynette.  On page 110, Doug dies in a freak accident.  (This was revealed on the dust jacket.)  You will have to wait until the very end of the story to find out if Lynette had something to do with Doug's demise.  In between, there is considerable everyday reading to do.<br /><br />The protagonist, Harley, narrates his current story in first person present tense, and tells his long running back story in first person past tense.  The author constantly interweaves the present story and back-story, a few paragraphs in the now, a few paragraphs from the before, present, past, present, past within the same chapter, to the point that chapter breaks become redundant.  This might be a clever structure for a MFA writer, but for this reader it was maddening, infuriating, like being tasked to watch two tennis matches at the same time, one in the fore the other at my aft, twisting not only my neck but my back and behind, and in the end not seeing or understanding the rhythm of either game.<br /><br />It appears you cannot get a MFA in writing unless your prose is loaded with sensory detail, the sounds, sights, smells and feel of the scene, every scene, and during dialogue too, including telephone conversations.  Kathryn Larrabee certainly got an A superlative in sensory detail.  Her prose is overstuffed with everyday detail, the tracking of everyday movements of miscellaneous everyday bystanders, the everyday mundane gestures, and everyday bland antidotes unrelated to the meager plot.  (My favorite is the girl in the back seat of a car in the parking lot flicking ashes out of the window.  That's it!)<br /><br />The writing is consistently insipid.  Larrabee's voice is neither shrill nor raspy, just monotonous.  She does provide a few mysteries though.  On page 12, Harley's mother is noted to have a sharp mind, not like some others at the retirement center, but on page 24, Harley sees she is lost and afraid and doesn't recognize him or his wife.

On page 146, at the end of a scene during which Harley wonders what his mother wants, she says, \\"I need something\\" and the scene ends.  Sorry, you will never find out what it was she needed.  There might be other examples that I missed while wading through sensory details.<br /><br />Stephen King in his text, ON WRITING, warns against naming minor characters; a named character suggests that the person is important.

US	50760769	R1ACXCKO3D9R3H	0140243933	342677195	They Whisper	Books	5	7	10	N	Y	About Sexuality	This review is for the Penguin Books paperback edition published in 1995.<br /><br />This is an incredible story.  In 1994, it was on USA Today's bestseller list for three weeks, peaking at 105.  Perhaps the puritanical hangover that plagues the righteous majority impeded its ascendancy, or maybe too many browsers, thumbing a fast flip two or three times noticed very little white, too many pages square with solid blocks of type, some all italics, some sentences so long nary a period for a page or two, and no chapters either, no place to stop and go pee, decided they'd rather not and tucked the book back on the shelf.  Indeed, it took me about forty pages to get comfortable with the writing style.<br /><br />THEY WHISPER is the first person narrative of Ira Holloway, an erogenous and sensitive man who loves women, who finds rapturous beauty in the crinkle of an instep as easily as in \\"her henna nipples\\" (pg. 300) or the \\"soft sargasso struck with this same sunlight there between her legs\\" (pg 308).  Ira is so sensitive and responsive that he hears the ethereal whispers of a woman's thoughts.  Mr. Butler does not push this phenomenon on the reader, he just lets it happen, and we accept it as a necessary device for Ira to adopt an omnipresent point of view in order to tell his story.  The whispering, along with the long runs of indirect and interior dialogue, interior monologue and stream of consciousness without chapters, at times feels like automatic writing but it eventually captivates.  Around page 149 the story was dragging, but recovered enough until page 192 when I wanted to quit, and then on page 193 I sensed the shadow of tragedy and kept on going.  I'm glad I did.<br /><br />Ira and his whispering women touch first on a nebulous relationship between sexuality and death, sexuality and fear, and then delve into sexuality and jealousy and particularly sexuality and religion.  For his incredible sentience, Ira seems a larger than life character.  He loves women and respects them; he perceives them precisely and is therefore able to respond in word or deed without risk of presumption or failure.  If we were all like Ira and his whispering women, we truly would be making love instead of war.<br /><br />A few caveats.  The timeline is tough.  Mr. Butler swirls his tale around in a 25-year period from 1955 when Ira is ten to 1980 when he is 35.  You have to keep in mind that the \\"present\\" is supposedly 1980.  Then, on page 223, Ira says, \\"Now in my thirty-sixth year.\\"  There are 37 proper names in THEY WHISPER, and some of these are caught in the swirl of events, popping in and out of Ira's head.  Some names you might forget, and the pages on which they first appear, are Karen Granger (1), Sam or Samantha (60) Amanda (96) Tran Thi Hoa (111), and Rebecca Mueller (117).omen and respects them; he perceives them precisely and is therefore able to respond in word or deed without risk of presumption or failure.

US	50760769	RT5WIN7BPYXAO	0684801523	193175702	The Great Gatsby	Books	5	0	0	N	Y	On the Green Light and other trivia	This review relates to the first Scribner trade paperback edition, 2003, of the corrected text authorized by the estate of the author.  It includes a preface and notes by Matthew J. Bruccoli, a publisher's afterward, a drawn map of the story site and a brief Fitzgerald biography.<br /><br />The green light in THE GREAT GATSBY is probably the most frequently cited example of \\"objective correlative\\" in fiction.  T. S. Eliot coined the phrase objective correlative for the author's device of describing an object so that it reveals an emotional state, but without explicitly linking the object and the emotion in the narrative.<br /><br />Fitzgerald mentioned the green light three times in the novel.  On page 26, when Nick is observing Gatsby gazing across the bay between East Egg and West Egg, Nick involuntarily glances seaward and distinguishes \\"nothing except a single green light, minute and far away, that might have been the end of a dock.\\"  On page 98, Gatsby says to Daisy, \\"You always have a green light that burns at the end of your dock.\\"  Finally, on page 189, at the end of the story, Nick the narrator tells us \\"Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgastic* future that year by year recedes before us.\\"  By then, the reader understands that the green light correlates to Gatsby's distracted longing for Daisy.<br /><br />*In his afterword, Mr. Bruccoli claims that Fitzgerald purposely used \\"orgastic\\" instead of \\"orgiastic.\\"  The Encarta dictionary accepts orgastic, but not the Microsoft Word spell checker or my WordWeb Thesaurus.<br /><br />For those interested in a timeline, do a Google search on: \\"last day of summer,\\" 1922, Gatsby.  The results should be two hits, both good timelines.  The one on geocities has at least one error, however; it has Cody dieing in 1910 instead of five years later.<br /><br />I found 113 proper names of persons, some only given names, some only surnames in the story.  Of these, 74 are names of Gatsby's guests listed on pages 65 - 67.  Fitzgerald mentions only two of those guests later in the story.  He does not give \\"Owl Eyes\\" a proper name, but he figures as a significant character.65 - 67.  Fitzgerald mentions only two of those guests later in the story.

Julie Smith has written nineteen novels in four mystery series.  The protagonists are Rebecca Schwartz, Paul McDonald, Skip Langdon and Talba Wallis.  MEAN WOMAN BLUES is the ninth and latest novel in the Skip Langdon series, and my gut feel is it will be the last.  It is the first Skip Langdon novel that I have read, and I found it self-contained, although the flurry of names in chapter one unsettled me.  Many of the characters, I realized, began their careers early in the Skip Langdon series.  It would have been smarter, I thought, to have started with the first Skip Langdon novel, NEW ORLEANS MOURNING, and follow Skip's career from the beginning.  Besides, NEW ORLEANS MOURNING won the Edgar Allan Poe award for best novel in 1991.  By the way, you can become acquainted with the author and her stories at [...]<br /><br />I have a problem remembering names, so I decided to reread chapter one of NEW ORLEANS MOURNING and list the characters, their roles and alias, and I continued to tabulate names throughout the novel.  In total, I found 77 proper names for people, three for pets, plus two phony names to mask the identity of the owner of a bank account and a cell phone.  Additionally, there were 28 nicknames, alias or maiden names used for some of the 77 characters.  I'm not sure, but I think that's a record for any book I've read recently.<br /><br />In LOUISIANA BIGSHOT, Skip pursues Errol Jacomine, a.k.a. Daddy, a.k.a. Eliza Dolittle, a.k.a. Earl, a.k.a. David Wright, a.k.a. Mr. Right, a.k.a. Earl Jackson.  Errol is trying to kill Skip, so it's a matter of who gets whom first.  It's an enjoyable story with a credulous plot, resonant dialogue and vivid descriptions of New Orleans and nearby places.  I like Julie Smith's writing.  She doesn't mess around with that drawn out, exhaustive, flowery stuff, but gives just enough for us to get the feel and smell of things, and lawd, dat girl got an ear for hows we talk down en N'Orleans.>	2004-09-24

Talba is young, black, a computer genius-hacker who, by day, wearing white blouse and navy blue skirt, works as a private eye in New Orleans.  At night, wearing colorful silks and a turban, and using the nom de plume \\"Baroness de Pontalba,\\" she reads poetry at dives in the French Quarter.  Talba lives with her nagging mom, \\"Miz Clara,\\" who cleaned white folk's homes to put her two kids through college.  Corry, Talba's brother, is a doctor, the least of Miz Clara's favored careers for her children (the others being Speaker of the House and President) so Talba being a PI is a bit of a disappointment.  Darryl, Talba's boyfriend, is a high school teacher, musician, and sometime bartender supporting his out-of-wedlock daughter.  With these down-to-earth characters, Smith weaves entertaining tales with resonant dialogue and vivid descriptions of New Orleans and nearby places.<br /><br />In this episode, Talba does some snooping for her friend Babalu and soon discovers that her fianc&eacute; is indeed cheating.  But a day or so later, Babalu commits suicide, or so the New Orleans cops have decided.  Talba gets a new client, the cheating boyfriend who believes Babalu was murdered, and Talba thinks so too.  The story evolves as Talba digs into the background of the mysterious Babalu and finds a web of sex, race and dirty politicians.  LOUISIANA BIGSHOT is a colorful, fast paced and enjoyable read with a sensible, credulous plot.	2004-09-24

I regret that I did.  The Kirkus review reveals the plot and spoils the read.<br /><br />RAINEY'S LAMENT is a well-written, literary tale about living with grief.  It's about a young girl abandoned by her mother, a young boy molested by his uncle, and about no one being prepared to deal with death.  It is about second-generation immigrants tenuously linked to the old country, about growing up and growing old, and about feeling all of those things.  It is not a happy story, but it's not entirely depressing either.  It's about ordinary life, which is sometimes disappointing, but nevertheless bearable, for most.<br /><br />Occasionally, I clean out my bookcases to make room for more, but some books don't get to go, because I'll read them again someday.  RAINEY'S LAMENT is one; it's a keeper.	2004-09-13

In this escapade, Loretta, Nick's sort of foster mother, asks Nick to locate her estranged brother Clyde James, a blues singer.  Loretta lost track of Clyde when he degenerated and dropped out of sight after someone killed Clyde's wife and another musician.  The murders are unsolved.<br /><br />In addition to Loretta and her husband Jojo, Elvis worshiper and antagonist Jesse Garon, a.k.a. Jon Burrows, continue from Ace Atkins first novel.  There are several new three-dimensional characters.  Perfect Leigh is a beautiful, young, ex-beauty queen cum scam artist a la mistress auditioning for killer.  Perfect is stalking Abby MacDonald, a tomboy who doesn't shave.  Perfect works for Levi Ransom, the owner of the Magnolia Grand casino and member of the Biloxi mafia.  In his search for Clyde, Travers goes to the Magnolia and, in the nick of time, saves Abby who is getting waxed by Perfect.  Thereafter, the story gets complicated.<br /><br />DARK END OF THE STREET has a complex array of interrelated subplots.  It requires some leaps of faith and the ending, from around chapter sixty on, seems disjointed, as if the author were pressed by a deadline.  Nevertheless, it's a good read.	2004-09-07

One of his associates, Michael Baker, a tenured professor in music history, went to the Mississippi Delta to research Robert Johnson, a blues musician who many believe was murdered in 1938.  Michael went missing and Dr. Sexton is worried because the Mississippi police aren't, so he sends Nick Travers, who teaches the history of blues at Tulane, to find him.  Thus begins Nick's adventurous career as a white mole immersed in black music that, so far, has spawned four Ace Atkins novels.<br /><br />CROSSROAD BLUES maintains a fast-paced mystery plot while giving rich insights into the jukes of the Mississippi Delta, the blues and the colorful characters who created this music.  Atkins writing is a bit rough in CROSSROAD BLUES, which is littered with whacky similes that I found irritating at first, although eventually wry, and some of his sentence fragments are mysteries in themselves.  Nevertheless, I recommend the Nick Travers series for its unique approach to the mystery thriller genre.	2004-09-07

They reveal how their novels developed or \\"gathered,\\" the relative importance of characters versus plot, whether or not they knew the ending before they wrote it, and the extent to which they used an outline or simply started writing without knowing what their characters were going to do.<br /><br />There is good stuff here for anyone curious about the literary fiction writing process, but don't expect to discover a magic formula.  There were only two consistencies amongst the 23 authors.  First, that characters drive fiction and the invention of characters precedes the development of plot.  Second, although nearly every one of the authors interviewed had an MFA (or PhD) in writing, none thought that the MFA itself helped them become writers.  These authors became successful writers by writing.  The value of the MFA, for them, was the contiguous time dedicated to writing and the association with other writers.<br /><br />After nearly five years, I recently finished my first novel.  I cannot tell you that my struggle would have been easier had I read NOVEL IDEAS first, but I certainly enjoyed reading it afterwards.  Read this book if you are interested in the truth about the process of writing literary fiction, which is evidently quite different from writing genre fiction.	2004-08-30

Branda's streetwise mother, the hard-drinking proprietor of a neighborhood bar in Milwaukee, worries over her only living child whose father skipped out long before the story begins.  No friends visit Branda during her several weeks in the hospital; she has only her mom and mediocre therapy to help her wrestle with memory lapses, blackouts and a scrambled psyche.  Branda is crippled; whereas the busted knee only hinders her physical advancement, her bruised mind obstructs her spiritual furtherance.  Before she leaves the hospital however, Molly, a compassionate nurse, sneaks Branda into the elevator and they visit Katherine, a comatose girl whose parents are presumed dead.  Katherine has been there seven years.<br /><br />Branda, lingering in darkness, cannot relate to her former friends.  Her loving mom fails in her attempts at remedy and sends Branda to tour London with a small group of people with special needs.  Upon arriving in London, Branda flees from that depressing group of invalids and finds refuge with Lady Sabrina, a lonely, fifty-something drag queen foraging for relevance in the sunset of his life.<br /><br />Ms. Ridley does a good job counter pointing the pains of Branda and Lady Sabrina during their separate journeys in pursuit of mended psyches.  Branda's knee brace, Katherine, and the hopeless invalids are adroit symbolic choices.  And the resolution is clever, far better than the one I had expected.<br /><br />\\"Throwing Roses\\" delves into the psyche traumas of two strong willed individuals who would otherwise have to scrounge for a commonality.  As such, it's an engaging tale.	2004-07-25

The analysis of Sinclair's turmoil purportedly reflects the European or German moral malaise at the time.<br />As a prepubescent boy, Sinclair recognizes the realm of good and light, symbolized by his God fearing parents and innocent younger sisters, as separate from the realm of evil and dark, symbolized by Franz Kromer, an older, opportunist who extorts Sinclair into fibbing and petty thievery.  Another older boy, Demian, rescues Sinclair from Kromer's clutches, and then sows a new perception of the light and dark realms with an inverted interpretation of the parable of Cain and Abel.  Demian perceives the mark on Cain's forehead not as a curse, but as a badge of courage, character and power.<br />Tainted by his experience with Kromer, Sinclair cannot entirely reject Demian's heroic characterization of Cain, and Demian nurtures this upset of clarity, muddling Sinclair's once clear distinction between the realms of good and evil.  Demian then plants the alternative perception that the individual must delve into the self to discover his peculiar fate and destiny, a unique purpose apart from the mundane consensus, the mores of the hoard.  Hesse then projects Sinclair's turmoil into a characterization of, or perhaps a reflection of, the mass psyche of prewar Europe.<br />I first read \\"Demian\\" forty years ago, shortly after years of total immersion in university studies.  Then younger and perhaps arrogant with intelligence, I felt armed and charged for the uncertain challenges ahead.<br />For some reason I saved \\"Demian,\\" packed it away along with my complete set of Ayn Rand's novels, trig tables and \\"100 Master Games of Modern Chess.\\"  \\"Demian\\" moved with me around the States, to Asia, and then to Latin America, getting old, wrinkled and as shelf-worn as I.

Now older and perhaps humbled by ignorance, I finally did, but I didn't discover precisely why I kept \\"Demian.\\"  The half-dozen marginal marks I made forty years ago do not score insightful premonitions of my life as I remember it.

Organized into seven sections beginning with &quot;Fate and Faith&quot; and concluding with &quot;Hope,&quot; the collection is in roughly chronological order.  To enjoy the thread of this work, the reader should note those section titles and keep them in mind while reading.<br />I am not a fan of Amy Tan's fiction.  &quot;The Bonesetter's Daughter&quot; could not sustain my interest and I have an uncertain memory of giving up on &quot;The Joy Luck Club&quot; as well.  Although both books peaked at number four on the USA Today's bestseller list, I've yet to develop a taste for their themes.<br />I began reading &quot;The Opposite of Fate&quot; with a tinge of obligation because it was a gift from a good friend, and continued reading with dedicated interest to the end.  Being an aspiring novelist, I was in part curious about the trials and tribulations of an accomplished writer of fiction, and this book has a wealth of singular anecdotes and insights.  But there is much more, principally Amy Tan's tenacious sprightliness in spite of tragedies, deaths and diseases, bad luck and ill fate, always clinging to the opposite of fate.  There are lessons in the Chinese-American philosophical, the multiple perspectives of truth, the management of memories and the indestructibility of mother-daughter love.<br />In the chapter &quot;Angst and the Second Book,&quot; Amy Tan discusses her determination to overcome the axiom that the second book is doomed no matter what the author does, but she does not mention how well her second novel did.  In fact, of her four novels, her second, &quot;The Kitchen God's Wife,&quot; faired the poorest, peaking at the 94th position in USA Today's bestseller list, and stayed on the chart for only five weeks.  Interestingly though, her first book, &quot;The Joy Luck Club,&quot; and the second novel entered USA Today's list on the same date, October 28, 1993.<br />Regardless of your interests, the final chapter of this book describing the advent and of a prolonged illness and its eventual diagnosis is essential reading.

One Hundred Years of Solitude is the rise and fall of Macondo and six generations of Buend&iacute;as.  It is a study in the futility of mad adventures to defeat the guile of church, state and the Banana Company.<br />M&aacute;rquez tells this tale as if it were oral tradition, a legend passed along through generations, spoken to children in rapture by once sturdy great-grandmothers rocking on the porch on cool summer nights.  Grandmothers, when telling a story to youngsters, are apt to blend illusion and reality, and M&aacute;rquez preserved that quality of the narration.  For example, the insomnia plague that infected the residents, not with drowsiness but with gradual loss of memory, requiring that every object be tagged with its name and purpose until Melquiades, the ancient sage, returns with a curative potion.<br />Young Rebeca, an unrecognized relative of the Buend&iacute;as, probably brought the insomnia plague.  Rebeca, who has an ancestral urge to eat dirt and whitewash, arrived at the Buend&iacute;a home with her parent's bones in a sack.  The sack roams through the house, with an annoying clac clac rattle, because no one has died yet in Macondo and the community lacks a cemetery.  That will change soon enough, though.<br />Macondo, founded in tranquillity and innocence, welcomes bands of gypsies bearing science (like ice and alchemy), magic and illusions.  The town admits Arabs too, who trade manufactured gadgets for macaws.  The state invades in the form of Don Apolinar Moscote, a self-proclaimed magistrate in a town that did not need one.

This book illustrates the more than 1,800 prints in the Center's collection.  There are 200 pages of six (occasionally 12) 5cm X 7cm photographs per 10.5 X 11-5/8 inch page.  The Center's accession number identifies each plate.<br />The photographs are arranged chronologically and, when applicable, include the name and date of the magazine that published the photo-essay.  The Archive, and this book, includes many photographs that Smith printed but were not included in the published essay, and includes unpublished assignments, pictures of family and friends and more.<br />The quality of photoengraving is remarkably excellent.<br />As far as I can determine, this is the only book containing the comprehensive work of W. Eugene Smith, truly the master of the photographic essay.	2003-06-05

It's a beautiful book.<br />Philip Porcella, a fashion photographer, undertook a project to photograph four models for this volume: Frederique van der Wal, a statuesque blond from the Netherlands; Randi Ingerman a dark-haired, green eyed Italian with a stupendous butt; Maki Shibuya, an oriental beauty; and Kersti Bowser, representing the sensual black.<br />These are not fashion photographs, or portraits of beautiful women.  Each image is a unique creation of location, lighting, props, pose and woman.  Some appear done in a studio, but the majority were photographed outdoors in the desert, or a Japanese garden, or the balcony of city building.  Indeed, the setting, mood and feeling of every photograph are different from all the others.  Most are in color, but when the mood called for B&W, it was use.<br />Porcella wrote in his very brief introduction: \\"This is one man's insight into four unique dimensions of that which has beguiled man since the beginning of time - the passion, the boldness, the strength, the beauty - a brief but enlightening journey into the secret that is woman.\\"<br />You've a fine insight Mr. Porcella.	2003-06-05

The photographs are not arranged in strict chronological order, however, but in an &quot;episodic&quot; form as a series of portfolios.

Minor judicial officials (corregidores) were supposed to defend Indian rights.  In practice, the encomenderos and corregidores, and later the mestizos seized the lands.  They indentured the Indians as tenant farmers, sold them into slave labor, or drove them out of the fertile river valleys into the mountains.  By 1964, 200 years of Spanish rule had cut the Quechua population in half and the large landholders (gamonales or hacendados) that constituted only one percent of Peruvian farmers held 62% of the land.<br />Peasant land invasions in the sierra began in 1952; the first peasant union (sindicato) was formed in 1957.  The formation of sindicatos, peasant strikes, and land invasions in the sierra continued through the 1960s and marginally improved the peasant condition.  (Ibid.)<br />In 1958, the charismatic Hugo Blanco, a Quechua Trotskyite educated in Argentina, began organizing peasant strikes in Cuzco.  About four years later Blanco and a small band of Indians formed a militia and engaged in guerrilla warfare in La Convenci&oacute;n and Lares provinces near Cuzco.  On Christmas day 1962, thirty peasants and five policemen died in a clash.  The government formally charged Hugo Blanco for the deaths.  In May 1963 troops consisting of Guardia Civil and Peruvian Investigative Police (PIP) encountered Hugo Blanco and his militia group.  Fortunately for Blanco, a PIP officer discovered him first as the Guardia Civil officer had orders to assassinate him.  The government held Blanco for three years before judging and sentencing him to twenty-years in prison.  The Velasco government exiled Blanco in 1971.  He published Land or Death the following year.  In late 1992, Hugo Blanco was in Mexico recovering from a brain hematoma.  (Hugo Blanco, Land or Death and various other sources.)<br />I read this book while researching the politics of Peru in the 1960s for a novel I am writing.  Unless you have a similar interest in these peasant uprisings from the point of view of a Trotskyite fomenting revolution, or Blancos candid appraisal as to why revolution failed, or insight into the mind of a Communist revolutionary, do not waste your time with this book.

The result is a fascinating study of the evolution of the Judean notion of a monotheistic God, the linchpin for the Jewish, Christian and Muslin religions.  Some reviews here either entirely shun Miles work or nit-pick at one of his arguments with certain shrillness, as if Miles had stepped on sacred toes.  Unless you can accept, at least temporarily, that man created God and not the other way around, you are liable to suffer a similar upset.<br />Miles is a scholar.  He has devoted his life to the study of religion, literature and language, and his writing is rich with insightful analogies.  This is not an easy read, however.

Paddy is a working class sheep shearer, but his wife Fee seems mysteriously aristocratic.  The story opens in 1915, in rural New Zealand on Meggie's fourth birthday.  Writing about the next two years in the life of the Cleary's, the author introduces us to the personalities, family relationships and struggles of Paddy, Fee and their first four children.<br />The story resumes in 1921 when Meggie is ten years old.  The Cleary's move to Drogheda in New South Wales, Australia.  Drogheda, in the Outback some 610 miles West of Sydney, is a vast sheep farm owned by Mary Carson, Paddy's long lost sister.  Mary Carson is immensely wealthy, shrewd, treacherous and weary of living.  Since Mary has no other living relatives, she invited Paddy to run Drogheda during her final years.  In return, he would inherit the bulk of her vast estate...well that's what she told Paddy.<br />Mary Carson has an interesting relationship with a twenty-eight year old, ambitious, handsome Catholic Priest, father Ralph de Bricassart.  Having enticed father Ralph with generous contributions to the church, Mary claws into his psyche to play mind-games, and conceives a twist that will set the story soaring.  The central intrigue, however, is going to be the relationship between Meggie and Father Ralph during the next 48 years.<br />This is a brilliantly crafted tale that draws the reader into life in the Australian outback where it took six weeks for the mail wagon to complete its rounds.  It also pokes a hard-nose into the workings of the Catholic Church and the trauma of celibacy.  The descriptions of Drogheda as it changes during the seasons and over the wet-drought cycle are a bit tedious at times, but otherwise the pace moves along with vivid and believable characters.	2003-03-16

When she was around thirteen, her family, affluent but not wealthy, moved into a big house on Peachtree Street, one of the principal settings for Gone with the Wind, which she began writing in 1926.  The Macmillan Company published Gone with the Wind in May 1936; it won the Pulitzer Prize in 1937.  The movie, which won ten Academy Awards, premiered in Atlantic City on December 15, 1939.<br />I read the Special Commemorative 60th-Anniversary Edition (paperback) purchased from Amazon.com in February 2003, which commemorates the film, not the book.  The back cover of that edition quotes the Washington Post claiming its The greatest love story of our time, the story of Scarlett OHara and Rhett Butler.  I suspect the person who wrote that saw the movie, but did not read the book.  If its the love story that interests you, I suggest you buy the video.  If you want to understand the origins of the Souths point of view though, at least the upper middle class Georgian point of view, then read this book.<br />I was raised in Connecticut and have been often perplexed by the notions of some of my Southern white peers, puzzled for example by the intractable bigotry of intelligent people who are unwilling to understand that they ought to know better.  Conversely, Ive admired the generous, unselfish, seemingly pointless hospitality given me by a Southern adversary, a rival, so incongruent that it smacked of hypocrisy.  Having read Gone with the Wind, Im less perplexed and puzzled now.  These people were bred on deep roots.<br />Margaret Mitchell fashioned her novel from stories about slavery, the Civil War, reconstruction and abolition told by those who had survived those dramatic events.  The people who lived through those terrible times, or their children, told those stories.  From these tales, Margaret Mitchell painted a broad panorama of a culture in forced transformation: The brutal and reprehensible conduct of the Yankees, the greed of the carpetbaggers, the noble origins of the KKK, and the corruption of the Norths reconstruction.  It is Southern noblesse telling the story of their decline.  Margaret Mitchell is their apologist.<br />The paperback version I read has 1024 pages of small type with narrow margins.  Mitchells writing is sometimes exciting, but often its tedious.  Descriptions tend to be excessive, and dialogue is often more like monologue.

This story is set London in early 1914 as Germany was mobilizing and war was inevitable to those that history would prove astute.  France was in peril even if England assisted, and the British Empire itself would be at risk if the Germans prevailed.  So, The First Lord of the Admiralty, Mr. Winston Churchill of the Liberal government, armed with a note from King George, convinces The (conservative) Earl of Walden to negotiate a secret treaty with his wife's nephew, Alex Orlov, also nephew to the Czar, for Russia to enter into the fray.  The anarchists learn of this plot however, and Feliks, The Man from St. Petersburg, has five pounds sterling and a determination to assassinate Alex Orlov on English soil.<br />This story is rich with the history that bored us in school, that stuff about Victorian pomp and starving Russian peasants floundering for a new political order, the prelude to communism.  Follett gives us a sense of the debauchery bred from wealth and privilege, and the desperation born of inhumanities in an era gone by.  He introduces us to men threatened by women's suffrage, others terrorized of government, and through them, we better understand why society changed, or perhaps mutated.  That stuff is woven seamlessly into a story of intrigue without long speeches or tedious lectures.  We get our lesson without having to take notes.<br />My only quarrel is Follett's propensity to interrupt with back-story, once with back-story within back-story if I'm not mistaken.  It's a minor irritation though, one scratch and it's gone, because we are more worried about how his characters are going to sort out the mess they're in.  And in the end, you're going to believe The Man from St. Petersburg might have been.	2003-02-13

As the story opens, Ben, on his initiative, meets with Madriani for the first time since Paul left the firm.  First, they discuss the disposition of Paul's terminated affair with Talia, and agree never to mention it again.  Then, Ben reveals that his being selected to fill a vacancy on the U.S. Supreme Court will be announced soon, and invites Paul to take over administration of an important trust fund since Ben will not have time for this responsibility in his new position.  Paul accepts and they agree to meet again for dinner the following night to discuss the details.<br />Shortly before the appointed hour for their next meeting, however, Ben supposedly blows away the top of his head with a shotgun.  No one really believes that Ben Potter killed himself though, and sure enough, we learn that not a shotgun, but a small caliper pistol like the one Talia owns was the true murder weapon.  Guess what! Talia is charged with murder and Paul Madriani, assisted by \\"tell it like it is\\" Harry are her lawyers.<br />The drama unfolds with manageable twists, turns and surprises.  The cops and the DA seemed convinced that Talia did it, but the reader is soon convinced that she's innocent, so the story has a \\"whodunit\\" element along with the courtroom drama.  Martini sets his story in \\"Capital City\\" in an unnamed State, which I suspect allows him to mix and match actual legal rules and proceedings from different jurisdictions to suit his plot and courtroom activity.  This is not obtrusive, at least for a non-lawyer.<br />It's a satisfying read; something to do while your waiting for the next Grisham novel.	2002-12-18

They live in a small town in Ontario in a 100-year-old farmhouse with an apple orchard, raspberry patch, and separate rooms for each of the three girls. Theirs is an affluent, unremarkable, middle class life, until the oldest daughter, nineteen-year-old Norah, goes missing and is found, uncommunicative, panhandling on a street corner in Toronto with a sign that reads \\"goodness.\\" Norah has abruptly and inexplicably withdrawn from the world refusing to talk to her parents, sisters or boyfriend.<br />Written in the first person narrative, Reta escorts the reader through a mother's daily routines under the dark cloud of a disconnected daughter. Each of her women friends and acquaintances express support and their unique insight for hopeful resolution. There is little Reta can do though. Once a week she drives to Toronto with food and clothes for a daughter that refuses to acknowledge her presence, so Reta spies on her from nearby stores. At home, she carefully sweeps the cellar stairs, as if getting the dirt out of the corners will somehow enlighten the shadow that has befallen her offspring. The timeless anguish of motherhood is palpable.<br />Shortly before Norah disappears, she laments to her mother over the immensity of the world, about her struggle to get past the little things. She says \\"I'm trying to find where I fit in.\\"<br />Given Reta's feminist perception of the world, she believes that her daughter's malignancy is founded in the exclusion and powerlessness of women, that despite \\"having come so far,\\" they've been snookered into the side pocket. Through Reta and her mentor Danielle Westerman, an aged literary feminist, Shield splatters her story with the female grievance, about the male power play and the non-recognition of women etc. It's not a hard sell though. Reta drafts letters criticizing male writers for excluding females from their lists of achievers, yet she never mails them. And in her ending, Shield wags her finger at the shrillness of Reta's complaint.<br />If you are a reader accustomed to being hooked in the first paragraph and reeled in by the end of chapter one, a reader who believes that a novel is first and foremost story and that style is irrelevant, you might be disappointed with Unless.

Mr. Querashi was to soon wed the beautiful Sahlah, daughter of Akram Malik.  In the Pakistani tradition, the parents of the bride and groom had arranged the marriage.  As part of the deal, Mr. Querashi had become Production Manager in Mr. Malik's mustard factory where he displaced the last non-Pakistani, full-time employee.<br />Just a few weeks ago Mr. Malik became the first Pakistani on the Town Council when his formidable adversary, the aging Agatha Shaw, was forced to resign due to a stroke.  Despite her condition and Malik's appointment, Mrs. Shaw, with the help of her grandson Theo, is determined to obtain the Council's approval for her project.  She is resolute in the renovation and development of the pleasure pier to attract tourists, resuscitate the town's economy and thus assure her legacy as savior of the community.<br />Querashi's death is threatening to ignite smoldering racial tensions, however.  The Asian's in general and Malik's son in particular suspect the murder was racially motivated and expect the police will ignore white suspects and blame a Pakistani.  Enter Sgt. Barbara Havers, who is conveniently vacationing in the town, to mediate with the Pakistani as police liaison.  As the case proceeds, Barbara discovers that nearly all the players have something to hide, including her self.

I rated the first in the series, \\"Running with the Demon,\\" five stars, which I rarely do.  The magic of that first novel dissipated in this sequel, however.<br />The first third of the book is heavy with back-story, and I do mean heavy as in dragging, lugging, burdensome, tedious, and arduous.  The author reiterates the theme, plot and principal scenes from his first book in narrative so boring it sucks the life from his old characters.<br />Even the new characters are lifeless.  Stef is so stunningly beautiful that the author cannot find the words to convince us that she is.  This time the demon is a \\"changling,\\" meaning it can assume the identity of any of the other characters, which robs it of a personality of its own.<br />At first, the identity of the demon is obvious to the reader, but not to the protagonist, John Ross.  With this tactic, the reader is supposed to cringe in fear for Ross, urging him to wake-up to his precarious situation.  Later, the author treats the demon's identity as if it were a mystery for the reader to ponder.  Unfortunately, I neither cringed nor pondered.<br />Even the dialogue is lifeless, unless you are impassioned by long speeches on the plight of the homeless and why Native Americans ought not to be called Indians.  Overall, this is good example of a book that gives sequels a bad name.	2002-10-23

Your son, Michael, says he's going to the movies, but when he comes home late he tells you that he and his new friends decided to play video games instead, and lost track of time.  It's a lie.  The boys \\"sort of\\" broke into a dive shop and went scuba diving at night in a gloomy lagoon.  So what?  Although it was only Michael's second dive, he's home safe, right?<br />Unfortunately, there was something insidious in those \\"borrowed\\" dive tanks that will involve you and your son in a ruthless scheme of such incredible complexity that it takes three scientists and a computer hacker to unravel the mystery and save Michael.  The problem is the author builds the complexity gradually until he has enough pages for a book, and then slams out the ending.  It's like getting cold runny eggs when you expected an omelet.<br />This plot is billed as suspense - mystery - horror, but Saul has to use science fiction and fantasy themes, or what I call \\"incredibilities,\\" to try to hold it together.  Saul attempts to create dread by giving an apparently normal, upstanding character extraordinary power to do incredibly awful stuff to the nearly defenseless until he's defeated in the last chapter.  That doesn't work for me as well as creating incredible characters with human frailties who have to struggle with the good guys throughout the story, so much so that you might doubt who's going to will win.

Mr. Wood devotes 11 pages (out of 185) to the novel query, including his model sample and one successful query.  You might get as much by surfing the web.  Still, I don't regret buying this book.<br />The majority of \\"Attention Grabbing...\\" discusses query letters and correspondence relating to non- fiction.

Well, here's your chance to get The Inside Scoop.<br />Allison guides us through the poverty and failures, stubbornness and pride, anger and hate, ugliness and incest, showing us how these people courageously avoid despair by spitting frequently out the side of the mouth, always away from the wind.  It is a powerful story because it is based on the childhood of a girl raised in extreme poverty, in Greenville County, who was born of a fifteen-year-old unwed mother, and who was frequently beaten and raped by her stepfather.<br />Before reading Bastard Out of Carolina, Allison's first novel, I attacked her second book, Cavedweller, but I had to surrender halfway through.  Although the theme in Cavedweller is similar to that in Bastard, Allison over cooked her premise, smothered it in style, and ruined my appetite before serving desert.  So, I was delightfully surprised with Bastard's straightforward prose, comprehensible dialogue, and its evolving, eventually suspenseful plot.  As the remaining pages diminished, I read faster, dying to know how Allison was going to wrap up Her story.  Wow, this one will stay with me for a long time.	2002-08-25

The story begins in 1939 when Peekay is five, and he is the smallest lad at a boarding school where his bed-wetting affliction is getting him in trouble.  He suffers constant abuse from a band of Nazi worshipping older boys, and even the teachers.  Peekay copes using his camouflage, his chameleon like skill to disguise his true nature.<br />After a year or so at the boarding school, Peekay is reunited with his mother, who had been hospitalized for conniptions, and his grandfather.  He has no father, the author never reveals why not, and none, least of all Peekay, seem to miss him.  His mother and grandfather are dear, but uninfluential.  Peekay treats his mother with tender respect, fearing that she will have another nervous breakdown, but he shuns her distorted Jesus-freak perception of the world.  Grandpa, who mostly tends roses and diddles with his pipe, isnt much help either.<br />Peekay is a prodigy, and he has the good fortune to choose good mentors, including a pugilistic railway conductor and an inveterate recidivist at the local penitentiary.  The most important of his tutors, however, is Doc, a washed out concert pianist who teaches music and collects aloe and cacti.  As Peekay and Doc explore the African veld, Doc tutors Peekay on many subjects, especially the value of thinking for himself.<br />Through Peekay, Doc and a host of other well crafted characters, Courtenay scrutinizes the logic of born again Christians, the ordained superiority of white men, the relevance of Jewishness, the glory of the English Empire, the origin of Afrikanerdom, the philosophy of apartheid, the disposition of cacti versus roses, and the significance of all deaths, even that of a kaffir chicken.  He entangles these concerns with strands of poignant romaticization.  You might want to keep the Kleenex box handy, particularly when Doc recuperates his musical genius long enough to compose the Concerto of the Great Southland.<br />This is a review of the paperback edition.y, particularly when Doc recuperates his musical genius long enough to compose the Concerto of the Great Southland.<br />This is a review of the paperback edition.	2002-08-21

Lottie, a.k.a. Charlie, the ten-year old daughter of Eve Bowen, the Undersecretary of State for Britain's Home Office.  Lottie, we soon discover, is the result of a brief but torrid romance with one Dennis Luxford while Eve attended a political conference eleven years previous.  Now, Dennis is the editor in chief of The Source, a \\"tawdry and noisome\\" tabloid that has achieved spectacular gains in circulation by exposing the scandalous behavior of Eve's peers in the Tory government.  The kidnapper is demanding that Luxford acknowledge his firstborn child on the front page of The Source.  The problem is no one except Eve and Luxford are supposed to know that he is Lottie's daddy, and be it known, Eve's political career will be ruined.  Certain that Luxford has staged Lottie's disappearance so he can print her humiliating disgrace, Eve hardly acknowledges that \\"she's gone missing.\\"  But the reader knows Dennis is innocent.<br />Elisabeth George develops this confused situation into an intricate and superbly plotted mystery with well-developed characters and rich dialogue.  George writes in the King's (or is it the Queen's?) English, though.  You might wonder what's going on when the sprat is told to shut his gob or he'll be gated for talking bosh.  But then, it's a mystery isn't it.<br />Whether or not you're a fan of British mystery genre novels, this is a highly recommended read.	2002-08-07
US	50760769	RSSKI60AQ2WU6	0385312776	581952770	River Song	Books	4	4	5	N	Y	Indian Gonzo Journalism	This is a story about contemporary American Indian life around the Washington State and Oregon border.  The author begins his acknowledgments by telling us \\"...this novel places fictional characters in actual places and against some historical events.\\"  The acknowledgments continue to reveal his considerable research into the history and anthropology of the Indians who live along the Columbia River, even as to the variation in pronunciation and spelling of certain Native American words from band to band.  Indeed, the book reads as if many of the incidents, conflicts and jokes in the story are embellished recollections of actual events.  Although billed as fiction, River Song is more a chronicle on the folklore and contemporary lifestyle of some Northwest Indians.  I'll call it Indian Gonzo Journalism.<br />In River Song, you are going to read about the trials and tribulations of a people living in trailers or BIA housing, and who refer to The Treaty on occasion.  They are stuck together by an ethnic bond, but in culture that allows them to con and cheat one another.  These people know how to pronounce Tiskaatpama and Tsau-tsau; they might eat at Cimiyetti's restaurant or picnic in Happy Canyon or at Preacher's Point.  Although the principal characters have common names like Danny, Jack, and Willis, you will also meet Iggy Two Medicine, Lucy Pretty Mink, and \\"one of the best-looking young women around Mission,\\" who never wears a bra, called Trudy Two Sleeps, perhaps because her winnemucca has been here and there.<br />These people survive near the bottom rung of the ladder by rodeoing, picking fruit and fishing.  They save the Segram's Seven for \\"Code Blue Emergencies.\\"  As migrant workers, Danny and Jack work along side illegal immigrants, Mexicans, who are the brunt of all their jokes.<br />River Song is not just about the economic struggle of a band of contemporary Native Americans.  Mr. Lesley tells us something of their history, and their beliefs, about Steah-hah masks, Night Ghosts, Weyekin animal spirits, and the value of dentalia shells.  Danny, the protagonist, has a vision of the Chinese Massacre of 1887 on the Snake River, an actual event.  At first, Danny doesn't know the relevance of this vision, doesn't recognize the river, and is even uncertain as to whether the victims are Indians or Chinese with suntans.  To sort it out, he consults Wauna the medicine woman and we learn how these people tame their ancestral spirits.<br />Being a Yankee raised amongst buttercups and maple trees, I also learned more than I ever wanted to know about the vegetation in Northern Oregon.  Up there they have bunch grass, hackberry, klamath weeds, service berries, snake-biscuit, blue bachelor buttons, bitter brush, camas bulbs, lupine, cheat grass, balsam root, rock lilies, and bluebells, to name a few.  Leslie Craig did teach me something valuable, though.  Now I can to tell the difference between Indians and Chinese with suntans.

This is a suspenseful, \\"who-done-it\\" murder story told from the POV of a lawyer, Paul Madriani, who is defending the apparently innocent Laurel Vega.  It has the standard elements.  Laurel complicates her defense by refusing or forgetting to tell her lawyer critical information.  Jimmy Lama, an influential but sleazy cop, is determined to railroad Laurel and sabotage Madriani's case.  On the other hand, Madriani has Harry his quirky partner and some good friends in important places, including his bed.<br />The story keeps you turning pages as Madriani's case bounds and rebounds from bad to worse, then from better to awful, as a result of clever legal maneuvering and unfortunate surprises.  The courtroom drama is plentiful, interesting and evidently realistic; Steve Martini has a law degree and practiced as a trial lawyer.<br />Martini's writing style irritated me at times.  On a few occasions, I had to stop to figure out to whom a pronoun referred to.  During the legal proceedings, he often interrupts the dialogue to interpret what is said, as if only a lawyer could grasp the significance.  A couple of times he abruptly jumped the scene, making me wonder if the typesetter might have left out a paragraph or two.  He reminds you of earlier events that he develops later in the story, however.  This helps busy people reading the book over several weeks.<br />The plot has some neat twists and surprises, yet the events and characters are believable, up to the point where the story should have ended.  In the final two chapters, Martini appends an ending after the ending that I guess was supposed to be the final ironic twist.  It didn't work for me.  After enjoying a fast and suspenseful ride through an interesting and credible plot, I felt as if someone dinged the fender on my brand new car.  Before reading Undue Influence, I suggest you tear out pages 439-457 (paperback version), seal them in an envelope, stick them in the freezer, and thaw them out next Christmas.	2002-07-17

There is a bad ass, ugly maentwrog.  It's ten feet tall and weighs well over five hundred pounds, has a wicked tongue and bad breath.  Wraith by definition is a spook and an enigma in character.  Pick the sylvan who is around 195 years old, is clearly a good guy however, because he says \\"criminy\\" every now and then.  These creatures manage magic.  The magic is uncertain.  It dissipates.  It might be spent on a lesser evil, or be exhausted while still required, and must be rejuvenated after each use, hopefully before the next need.  If you think all this sounds silly, you're mistaken.  This is a good story told well.<br />Terry Brooks did not write this story by himself.  Sure, he had an idea about what was supposed to happen when he started writing, but then his characters took over the tale and did pretty much what they wanted.  In a chronicle of good and evil, we know who is supposed to win, but you're going to wonder.  I'm certain even Mr. Brooks didn't know how this one would turn out, because when you let the characters tell the story all hell breaks loose.  You ought not to presume the ending; there's a sequel!<br />Nest Freemark, the protagonist, is a fourteen-year-old girl complete with freckles who runs like a bat out of hell.  When Nest was very young her mother fell off a cliff, or perhaps she jumped, and her father disappeared before she was born.  Nest lives with her grandpa, Old Bob, and Evelyn, her grandma.  Grandma smokes and drinks a lot, and she mostly just sits at the kitchen table.  \\"She (Nest) imagined her grandmother sitting alone at the kitchen table in the soft, tree filtered light of moon and stars, smoking her cigarettes, drinking her bourbon, and reflecting on the secrets she hid.\\"<br />Grandma Evelyn is special because she is the only one besides Nest who can see the \\"feeders,\\" those shadowy, yellow-eyed things that are more a concept than creatures.  Nest likes her grandma.  You will too, not because she bakes cookies, which she does, but because she's a tough cookie.<br />Old Bob is tough too.  He knows that Evelyn has secrets, and during their long life together, she has mentioned the feeders and maybe the other creatures too.  Of course, Bob doesn't believe in that nonsense, he's not ready yet, and maybe he never will be.  As the story unfolds however, you're going to want to kick Old Bob in the butt to wake him up as to what's happening out there in Sinnissippi Park because Nest is in danger.<br />The spooky stuff works because Brooks' characters are real, even the demon.  As the Knight of the Word told Nest, \\"The demon is not perfect....  He makes mistakes just like humans.  He was human once....\\"<br />Running with the Demon is an enjoyable, suspenseful read.Nest likes her grandma.

I read The Blackstone Chronicles as part of a project to read twenty novels, two by each of ten selected authors.  Chronicles is the fourth of the twenty, and the first ever by John Saul.<br />By my side, as I write this, is a flyer that tells me John Saul has written 30 straight N.Y. Times bestsellers, including...his six part serial novel The Blackstone Chronicles....\\"  So how, I wonder, could I be so audacious, brazen and insolent to rate this tale a \\"three...\\"  I've gotten old, however, opinionated, and it's a three.<br />The writer of good horror fiction takes the incredible and weaves it into a cloak of credibility.  The author's job is to make the reader believe, or at least vicariously wonder for awhile, if the absurd is possible.  To accomplish this, the novelist must create characters that we identify with, and then suck us in to take possession of them in an improbable scene.  We ought to cringe, sweat and fear the next sentence, yet have to read on despite our better judgment.<br />I'm sorry Mr. Saul; I read Chronicles in the middle of the night by a lone 75-watt bulb and not once was I afraid of going to the toilet.<br />I liked the town, though.  At the beginning of the combined version of the six part series, in the \\"Dear Reader\\" section, Mr. Saul admits \\"I have been living in the fictional town of Blackstone in my head.\\"  Me too.  I was raised in a small New England town.  Although the place where I grew up is not quite like Blackstone, it's close enough.  And from the perspective of a young boy, we had some neighbors that were as quirky and scary as the lost souls in the imaginary Blackstone are supposed to be.<br />Still, in the end, especially in the end, the tale didn't work for me.  Perhaps the series structure is at fault.  Each of the six parts deals with a \\"gift\\" that causes mayhem.  So designed, the author had to deal with six improbabilities and make them credible enough to make us scared.  As I recall, even Steven King will tackle only one implausibility per novel.<br />In the afterword, Mr. Saul mentions that he might again write about the citizens of Blackstone.  If he does, I hope it's about just one book-length incredibility, and that his maniacs stay true to character..

US	50760769	R3T1SNVTV8UX2Z	0671041789	867268465	The Green Mile	Books	5	1	1	N	Y	Comparing the Paperback and Video Versions	I've a project to read two books by each of the ten novelists who will be lecturing at the Maui Writers Conference this summer.  When I finished The Blackstone Chronicles by John Saul, a serial horror novel which the author says he was encouraged to write by King's success with The Green Mile, I took a break to engage in another pending project; to compare the book and video versions of The Green Mile.<br />My stepdaughter is an avid reader and a Stephen King fan.  After enjoying the video version of The Green Mile, I asked her if the book was significantly different.  She said it was very similar, but varied in some respects.  It occurred to me that comparing the two might be helpful in understanding the difference between book and script writing.<br />It was.  Both the movie and the book are five-star.  Despite their similarities, they have a different feel, and doing both is a worthy endeavor.  I recommend you read the book first, but that's not crucial.<br />My review technique was to read about a scene, study its video version and then read some more; I used the rewind button frequently.  This method percolates up some interesting trivialities.  In the movie, Coffey says, \\"as lonely as a sparrow in the rain,\\" but in the book he says \\"as lonely as a robin in the rain.\\"  King is an expert writer in every respect, and I'm certain his research is faithfully done.  I suspect \\"robin\\" was a boo-boo though.  Stephen King hangs out in New England, where robins are plentiful.  Coffey is a southern boy, and not too bright.  He never saw a robin.<br />Another triviality that smacks of a research problem is the year.  The events in the book happen in 1932, whereas the movie is set in 1935.  Some Hollywood sharpie may have noted that a crucial prop was not available in 1932.  I couldn't spot the problem, perhaps because I wasn't born until 1936.<br />Maybe the clip from the Fred Astaire movie shifted the date.  Although watching movies in the \\"Resource Room\\" at the Georgia Pines home for \\"wayward droolers\\" is featured in the book, the tear-jerking dancing scene is not.  Congratulations Hollywood, you gave me a real Kleenex moment.  I doubt if even a master like Steven King could write that cry, however, or even want to.  Hollywood has the advantages of sight and sound to stir our emotions.  Movies, after all, are drama; a combination of facial expressions, artful camerawork and musical scoring designed to grab us in the groin.  Writing, on the other hand, can suck us into the minds of the characters, and make us think.<br />That is why I say the feel of the two versions, two unlike mediums, is different.  This is a story about death.  While reading the book, I shuddered on occasion with a sense of mortality, my mortality.  King made me droop his book onto my lap as I stared at the willow tree out back, he having reminded me that my time is running out.<br />The video, on the other hand, often had me wiping my eyes, as much from laughter as the pathos, the response to good actors playing out a predicament and making it feel real.  Still, even with the facilities of the pause and rewind buttons, the movie is about this scene, then the next one, and moving right along.  How often have you walked out of the theater after the show before you could begin to think about it?<br />The acting is excellent.  Expressions, pauses, posture and stutters suggest what is going on in the character's head, but they cannot compete with the power of the written word.  When Paul and his wife visit Melinda, who is dying from a brain tumor, King writes for Paul:  \\"...my eye happened on the blue hearth rug by the fireplace.  It occurred to me that it should have the shade of tired old limes, because now this room was just another version of the Green Mile.\\"  Hollywood can't do that.<br />Writers work with protagonists, whereas scriptwriters work with stars.  Although the movie dialogue is usually verbatim the book, the best lines from Brutus and Dean, like \\"What happens on the Mile, stays on the Mile,\\" are given to Tom Hanks.  In the book, when Brutus and Paul (Hanks) confront Percy in the room with Old Sparky, Percy drives the end of the scene and forces the handshake.  In the movie, Tom Hanks never loses control of the altercation. Hollywood's tendency to sharply distinguish between its villains and heroes sometimes overly exaggerates reality, although it was not offensive in this case.<br />There are some subtle differences for the role of women.  In the book, King points out that only two women attended Delacroix's execution; there are several in the movie.  In the book, Paul's wife pointedly excuses herself when the men plan their risky mission, whereas in the movie she is an influential participant.  Hollywood, I suppose, is more politically sensitive than King.<br />There are only two major differences between the two works.  In the book, Paul sleuths the solution to uncertainties about the death of the Detterick twins.  The movie accomplishes this with dramatic visualization by making one of King's incrediblenesses more incredible.  I prefer King's version; too much hard to believe stuff upsets my stomach.<br />The other significant difference is that the movie version eliminates the sub-story with Brad Dolan, the Georgia Pines orderly.  To me, this is an important plot echo, a twist on the theme of mortality.  Its omission underscores the difference between the two forms, the visual versus the thoughtful.  Similarly, after reading the book, you might remember what John Coffey said about Old Sparky; \\"They're still in there.  I hear them screaming.\\"  King put it in Italics; the movie left it out.<br />As an amateur (i.e. unpublished) novelist, I sought to understand the difference between book and script writing.  I found my answer just as the credits began scrolling up the tube.  \\"Screenplay written by Frank Darabont, based on a novel by Steven King.\\"at happens on the Mile, stays on the Mile,\\" are given to Tom Hanks.

In this tale, the author kills Delias two irresponsible, wretched husbands so she can empower herself for prime time on the Lifetime channel.  As far as I read, the only surviving males are preachers.<br />Allisons prose reeks like a woman who overdoses on her favorite perfume; it smothers and distracts rather than enhances.  She interrupts a dialogue between granddaddy and Delia with: Granddaddy Byrd spat again.  Cissy looked at the spot in the dust where the spit had landed.  There was a barely a mark (sic).  The dirt looked like gray powder, but it was unyielding.  I got a good measure of granddaddy when he spat again, but by the time Cissy finished observing the dirt, I forgot what he said to Delia.<br />This is typical of every dialogue in Cavedweller.  Smidgens of speech are interspersed with tedious interpretations of significance, explanatory back-story, or embellished circumstance of no apparent significance.  Like a mother suffocating her childs efforts to tell a story with her own translation, Allison wont let her characters speak for themselves, and they never acquire a life of their own.<br />In my perception of the real world, a ten year old disappointed with the chicken chili might warp her face in putrid disgust, shove the bowl away and declare it to be yucky, or if the child is resourceful, intensely gross.  Cissy, Delias little daughter, however, suffers in silence and thinks The chicken was stringy and tough, the tomato tasted bitter, and the chili powder made her tongue feel spongy.  In the next paragraph, Cissys mind muses in flamboyant hyphenation when she thinks of her half-sisters as a sharp-beaked, black-winged crow cawing loudly and a wire-haired boar with razor-tipped hooves.<br />Clint, Delia dastardly first husband, talks the glitzy as well.  In his deathbed, Clint rambles in poetic monologue (on fire with the memory, just hot all over with shame) while Cissy meditates in prosaic similes, like as true as the links on a surveyors chain and like a ghostly wraith in a novel.<br />We do learn that everyone in Cayro, Georgia, without exception, says ant.

The stage is a struggling caf&eacute; where regular patrons and a happenstance staff nurture one another with their idiosyncrasies.  The story opens with a diversity of troubles progressively divulged, some of which are more or less resolved with love and forgiveness, while others evolve.  You will recognize most of the characters and their plights, if you have lived long enough, and if you haven't, sooner or later you will encounter them.  Perhaps they are a bit quirkier than the ones you know, or will meet, because they have been embellished, made vibrant by a good storyteller.<br />A year later the characters have settled some troubles, or so they think, and confront new worries.  They are upbeat and hopeful; life goes on.  It's a good read and, like my daddy wrote, you'll look back and relish the experience.	2002-05-17

Their current situation is enticingly unpredictable and believable, except for the concatenation of bad choices made by everyone.  But we learn that is to be expected, given the tragic or pitiful backgrounds of each character, which the author intertwines, one at a time, with the current story.<br />It is an ambitious endeavor, handling six POV's, since each of their backstories has enough psychosis or twisted irony to warrant a separate novel.  The author solves her problem by condensing the six histories to pivotal events, and clearly stating the lessons unlearned.  She wraps up her plot in a similar manner, making certain that her readers will not have compassion for any of her sorry characters.<br />I did find the suspenseful wait for the next typo invigorating, however.	2002-05-08
