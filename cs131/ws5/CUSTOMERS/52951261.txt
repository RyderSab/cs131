I'd read some of her short stories here and there, but none of her novels had jumped out at me from the bookshelf until now. <br /> <br />I'm struggling to put into words exactly what it is that makes the book such a great read. A good part of it is the pacing, I think, as well as just the right balance (for me, at least) between between description and action, and between language and story. This may just be me, but with most fiction out there, I usually feel that either the language overwhelms the story or the story overpowers the language. This is one of the rare books where they are equally strong, complementing each other rather than fighting for my attention. Most of all, though, it's simply a damn good story. <br /> <br />I guess a brief summary would be that Mira grew up in a house that was very mysterious in many ways (and not in the cliched ways which are no longer mysterious at all), in New Mexico. When she's nine, her mother disappears and she is sent to live with foster parents who are required to move to a new state and change their names as a requirement of the mysterious trustees of her mother's estate. All sorts of things happen, eventually building up to a middle-aged Mira returning to the house she grew up in, which she'd now inherited. She starts trying to understand all of the mysteries that surround her childhood, her mother, the house, her foster parents, and her connection with art and color.   <br /> <br />The book pulls together an amazing mix of art, local history and culture, psychology, hidden family secrets, and the paranormal -- and more importantly, all in a way that builds the story, rather than just dumping information here and there because the author had it.	2005-09-15

Ro feels like she's being forced into the move, and dreads moving out into the sticks where she won't know anyone at all, and won't have the same work or social opportunities. Not surprisingly, there are some marital tensions underlying the struggle over the move.   <br /> <br />All of this sounded like a great set-up for a chick-lit book that would be a little more thoughtful than usual.  And in small bits and places, it definitely happens.  The ending, for example, was ideal in that regard, and would especially be appreciated by anyone with an autistic/Asperger's child in their life. <br /> <br />That said, the reading experience was more frustrating than enjoyable throughout most of the book. The plot seems to ramble -- not quite aimlessly, but almost as if the author had three or four different books in mind, and kept switching back and forth while writing.	2005-09-15

The foundation of the book may be the lives of Benedictine monks, but what they've learned over the centuries can be useful to all of us.  <br /> <br />The book does a great job of illustrating the principles with real life examples, and doesn't paper over the challenges involved.	2005-06-02

This book talks about the different ways in which Catholic women today can explore whether they're being called to religious life, married life, or the single life -- there are stories of women trying to discern their call, stories of women who've made significant changes midlife to answer their call, and even stories of women who decided that the religious life wasn't for them after all.  The book also demystifies the different types of contemplative nuns and active sisters, and goes into all the practical details involved of joining a religious community - from the financial matters to higher education to clothing.<br /><br />The depiction of the spiritual and prayer life of the nuns and sisters in this book would be valuable to any Catholic woman - regardless of age or vocation, you will find inspiration here.	2005-06-02

On top of that, here are some specifics about this book that I loved: <br /> <br />* There's a picture for every dish -- I don't know about other people, but I'm much more likely to try a new dish if I know what it should look like. <br /> <br />* For every dish, they have a sidebar discussing possible alternatives and substitutions. <br /> <br />* The dishes cover a wide variety of regions and cultures, including several that you just don't see in cookbooks that often. <br /> <br />* The book has a good general introduction with tips on cooking seafood in general, making it all much less overwhelming to those of us unfamiliar with it all. <br /> <br />* In addition to all the recipes for grilling, broiling, roasting, etc, that show up in every seafood cookbook, this one has some amazing recipes for seafood stews. <br /> <br />The only negatives I would have about the book are that 1) it isn't spiral bound, which I really wish all cookbooks would be, and 2) the chapter on sauteed and fried fish was less exciting than the others.	2005-05-08

I love British chick lit in general, especially Marian Keyes.  I love books about nannies.  And I love books where you see women progress from dashing but scumbag boyfriends to true soul mates, even if they are trite at times.   <br /> <br />My expectations weren't really that high -- I wasn't looking for high literature, I was looking for something light-hearted and fun to read in the bathtub. And while the book started out on that track, it ended up going in so many directions at once that the fun was lost.   <br /> <br />Yes, the book is about a woman who is jilted by her dashing but scumbag boyfriend, and turns to being a nanny as a transition.  But it's also about the woman she works for, who's struggling with alcoholism and writers block and a troubled marriage. And her husband, who is an aging rock star who likes to molest the nannies and leaves his wife for an air-headed starlet who pretends to write, but doesn't really.  And also about some people she met at the wedding she attends in the beginning of the book with the scumbag, including the interesting PR girl who sleeps with the groom on his wedding night, and a handsome if odd young man who is acting like one of the caterers but is really heir to the castle the wedding is held in. And did I mention that the original woman in question is also trying to write a novel, and that's why she wanted to work for the crazy woman with writers block?   <br /> <br />Sadly, I haven't mentioned half of the characters and plotlines crammed into this book, but suffice it to say that none of them were well-developed.	2005-01-17

Books	3	3	5	N	N	Interesting enough, but others have done it better	The basic plot here is that a somewhat shady research group has been illicitly using government grants and black-market trading to finance the development of a project that will provide them with electronic immortality - their brains will be scanned into an online computer system where they can live forever.  The black market dealings attract the attention of an FBI agent, and since he is about to blow their cover, the mad scientists kidnap him and use him as their first \\"test subject\\".  Of course, the process of scanning the brains also destroys the brain tissue, so his physical body is killed in the process.  The bulk of the book focuses on the agent's struggle to adapt to his new existence and keep the mad scientists from destroying him, and on his wife's struggle to find out what happened to him -- with some help from the mad scientist's daughter.  A little simplified, of course, but this is the jist of it.   <br /> <br />I probably would have enjoyed this book more had I not previously read another that did a far better job with the same topic - John Saul's 'Shadows'.  In that book, the mad scientists in question are using the brains of genius but troubled children - creating a much more intriguing perspective on the events.  'Shadows' also does a better job with character development and providing a three-dimensional backstory.	2005-01-17

I picked it up from a display of chick lit, and from the blurbs it appeared to be in that same vein, if aimed at a somewhat older audience.   <br /> <br />Instead, I found it to be a book that seemed to focus more on the writing style than on the plot -- and by the third chapter in, I found the former increasingly tedious and the latter glaringly obvious.   <br /> <br />The concept of the book had sounded appealing: middle-aged woman catches her husband cheating, and finds that the experience shocks her system enough to break through the dryness of her existence.  In reality, the book struggles to move past crass caricatures for character development, and never moves past the cliche of \\"woman realizes that she needs to fulfill her own needs and not only those of her family\\".  There's nothing wrong with that as a concept, but it's not enough to carry a book entirely.   <br /> <br />As mentioned above, I had expected the book to read like chick lit - but in contrast to simple, story-focused language usually seen in that genre, this book is full of faux-poetic stylings like \\"I am so drunk with the blue and morning light and from the sound of the waves and from the feel of the already warm sand against my pale skin that I am not at all startled to see Elizabeth sprawled in the sand with her breasts pointed toward the sky, and what looks like a pina colada in her right hand.\\" <br /> <br />I had originally thought of sending this book to my mother - after all, there seems to be fewer books each year about strong older women. In retrospect, I'm quite glad I read the book myself first - I think she probably would have been offended by the bisexual overtones throughout the book, which were not hinted at in the blurbs.	2005-01-17

Definitely a great resource for someone trying to learn the prayers - either children, RCIA candidates, or adults trying to reground themselves in Catholicism. I can also see just playing it in the background sometime - it's soothing and peaceful. <br /> <br />There were two speakers - one male and one female - and my one complaint would be that I sometimes felt that the male speaker sounded too... dramatic, like he was trying too hard to sound extra reverent.  His voice kept reminding me of funeral home directors from bad movies, truthfully.    <br /> <br />Still, I felt the overall content of the CD well worth 4 stars.	2004-12-03

I actually really appreciated his efforts at characterization and description, although I did feel this came through much better in the ancient weave of the story than in the modern.  <br /> <br />A friend summed up what he thought as the main reason why many of Baxter's fans weren't as fond of this book as his others -- unlike the other Baxter books, my friend labeled this one as \\"girl science fiction\\". I can't say whether or not that is true -- but I am without a Y chromosome myself, and was drawn to this book even though I've never felt an urge to read any of his other books (even after thumbing through them).	2004-11-29

This isn't the easiest book to find, but is definitely a worthwhile find, especially for those who remember being amazed at the Soviet domination in Olympic athletics.  Myself, I tracked down the book mostly to see the chapters on gymnastics, but did enjoy reading the entire book.   <br /> <br />Be forewarned, though, that the book definitely does have the air of propaganda about it.  It was written by an American author after her interviews there, and published by an American company, but some of what is presented still seems like too much whitewashed sunshine to be taken at face value.  I almost had the impression reading it that the Soviets had very carefully censored what she saw and who she talked to, and that she had been gullibly taken in.    <br /> <br />Despite that, there were some lovely tidbits - for example, a story about how overweight girls weren't turned away from rhythmic gymnastics, but instead segregated into their own classes.	2004-11-17

It felt like someone had all these funny stories about what had happened to them, and decided to turn them into a book, embellishing here and there.  To me, the plot seemed like an afterthought, a way to string the anecdotes together, rather than the foundation.  There definitely were some really funny parts, so it wasn't a worthless read, but I do regret paying full price for the book.	2004-11-13

One of the things I like best about all the Sweet Potato Queen books is how much they celebrate women of all ages and shapes.  Too much chick lit can sometimes leave a girl wondering if the really fun things in life only happen to thin girls in the city, but that's definitely not the case here.      Not only a fun book to read, but definitely a great gift -- for anyone upset about their man, or for a man who really wants to understand women but just isn't getting it.	2004-11-13

I keep a copy of this book in my office to loan out to students who are reviewing for biostatistics exams, and colleagues who feel the need to brush up on their biostats.  <br /> <br />The book definitely does assume some basic knowledge about statistics -- I wouldn't recommend it for someone trying to learn about biostats for the first time.  It's really best for someone who already has some kind of formal training in biostatistics, but doesn't want to have to dredge through the heavy textbooks for every question -- I can definitely find the answers to my most common questions in this book much more quickly than I can in my formal textbooks.   <br /> <br />For those looking for a less technical introduction to biostatistics that doesn't presume a lot of preexisting knowledge, I'd suggest Modulsky's 'Intuitive Biostatistics'.	2004-11-02

First, no attempt seems to have been made to standardize the size of the recipes -- and you can't tell from reading the recipe whether it was developed for a 2 qt crock-pot or an 8-qt one.  Other crock-pot cookbooks I've found have all recipes calculated for one size (often the common 4-5 qt crock-pot), and those using other sizes know to multiply or divide as need be.  Another aspect that seemed missing in this cookbook was an introductory section with general crock-pot cooking tips -- since so many crock-pot cookers are students, young adults, or those just unfamiliar with cookery, this can be incredibly important.   <br /> <br />Two books I'd recommend instead of this one are \\"Betty Crocker's Easy Slow Cooker Dinners\\" and \\"Crock-It\\" -- the former will appeal more to those wanting to cook dishes from a diverse range of cultures, the latter will appeal to those looking to use the crock-pot for homestyle casseroles and the like.	2004-10-26

I loved 'The Husband Test' and the two books that followed, and picked this book after those.   <br /> <br />As I said, it took me a few chapters to get into it, but once I did, I really enjoyed it.  While I don't know that I'd necessarily read it again and again, I definitely put it back on my bookshelf to keep rather than out with the pile for the used book store -- something which not many mass market books achieve in my household.   <br /> <br />Like most of Krahn's books, the strength lies in the incredible tension between the different characters, the depth of the emotion, and Krahn's ability to portray independent women while still retaining an incredible amount of historical accuracy.	2004-10-19

While some of the problems  are considerably beyond the grasp of all but the most gifted students,  others lie more reasonably on the more challenging side of what  &quot;average&quot; students are capable of.  Solving these problems really  encourages students to mentally stretch more than the average story  problems in a textbook, and the level of achievement students feel after  solving one is truly gratifying.  I've found these problems to be  especially good for small group work or &quot;team&quot; competitions.	2000-07-15

Once I started  using the book, however, I discovered that those bare bones were  exceptionally good ones.  While this book may not appear attractive, it  does exactly what it promises -- provides Russian-English and  English-Russian of an incredibly wide array of medical terms and questions  and statements commonly made by both generalists and specialists during a  patient exam.  Another plus is that book is arranged by topic, rather than  alphabetically -- for example, there's one section that includes all the  questions one might ask a pregnant woman.  <br />Definitely worth the  investment!	2000-07-15

The later pages in a section mix the problems so that the students must decide which technique to use. 2) The quantity of exercises alone is really helpful -- for students for whom repetition is the key, the number of easy to &quot;intermediate&quot; exercises provides enough practice to help the material &quot;stick&quot; with the students.	2000-07-15
US	52951261	RHE3MBTMDOF3A	0786704934	290075179	Time Machines	Books	4	5	7	N	N	A satisfying read	As the editorial review mentions, these stories are not necessarily the ones you'd see up for the Hugo Awards -- this isn't really a &quot;best of&quot; kind of anthology.  However, this is exactly the reason why I  enjoyed this book so much.  I've already read the &quot;best of&quot;  stories, and I was looking for something new.  This book did a wonderful  job of combining some of my favorite short stories in the genre with other  excellent stories I'd never even heard of before.  I originally purchased  the book solely to get my hands on a copy of the story &quot;Star,  Bright&quot; by Mark Clifton (one of my favorites since childhood), but  thoroughly enjoyed the rest of the book as well.  <br />As an aside, I've also  found these stories to be well read and enjoyed by the junior and senior  high students I teach.  Short stories are a great way to introduce them to  the genre of science fiction!	2000-07-15

Aristoi is a complete book, but there's still so much left to figure out -- I would really like to see what happens next.    <BR> One of the things I really like about the book was the realistic-ness of the science.  While Aristoi definitely isn't &quot;hard&quot; science fiction, <BR> <BR> <BR> a lot of it is based on actual science and psychology.	1998-04-26
