This is just another in a long, long line of \\"young adult\\" novels in which the message boils down to: When you find the \\"right\\" guy, have sex with him. It doesn't really matter that, in this case, the \\"guy\\" is from another planet.   And from a science-fiction standpoint it leaves very much to be desired. It's strongly implied that Branko, a human-like alien, comes from a planet in our solar system. That's an idea that's outdated by at least a half century, if not much more than that.	2005-07-04

Strange that this book has affected me in three different ways at different times of my life. First, when I was a child entranced by the wonderful words and illustrations while having the story read to me and millions of other children by the television legend \\"Captain Kangaroo\\" in the 1960s. Second, when I was a father introducing my own children to a classic story. And now, happening to stumble on the book and read it many years later, and realizing what an eerily accurate metaphor it is for today's world of downsizing, outsourcing, offshoring, and impending leaps forward in biotechnology, robotics, and other technoligies that will transform society. Will there be a happy ending resulting from these changes, as there was for Mike and Mary Ann?	2005-04-23

Many of the earlier reviews on this site call for a reissue of the sequel, \\"After Worlds Collide\\". Please note: BOTH STORIES, \\"When Worlds Collide\\" and \\"After Worlds Collide\\", are contained in this paperback version. The title is misleading because it only includes \\"When...\\" -- but both stories are there.  Other reviewers have correctlly noted that there are some scientific inaccuracies, and some 1930s political and social views that seem out of place today. Who cares?! This is a wonderful story. In part 1, the authors concoct an excellent apocalyptic scenario. And in part 2, their conception of the alien planet is brilliant.   This is a very well-told yarn.	2005-01-23

Diatribes against Crichton's debunking of global warming <br />2. Critiques of the unlikely characters and plot twists <br />You can dismiss #1 -- that's just a bunch of people whose religion is being threatened. And make no mistake, environmentalism is a religion to many people. #2 is legitimate criticism. Some of the stuff that happens in the book is far-fetched to the point of silliness. Overall, though, I think Crichton's two aims were to write a reasonably entertaining story, and to cast suitable doubt on the idea that the earth is turning into a deadly, hot greenhouse and we have to do something NOW! <br />I believe he succeeded in both aims.	2005-01-08

The \\"Hardy Boys\\" books that you can buy at stores and on this site today are not the original stories. All the books were rewritten a few decades ago with two goals in mind: to dumb them down, and to make them more politically correct. The first goal was thought necessary because modern kids couldn't read as well; the second, because some of the books contained stereotypes unacceptable to modern sensibilities. The problem is that in making these changes, the stories were left far less interesting, and far less well written, than the originals. <br />I recently found a copy of the original \\"Secret of the Old Mill\\". It is far, far superior to the version people are reviewing here. And that story, at least, contained no offensive stereotypes. <br />You can find the original versions at used book stores (I found \\"Secret of the Old Mill\\" in good shape for seven bucks), and there is an online company that sells re-issues of the originals (I won't name it on Amazon's site, but you can search for it).  <br />Find the originals and read them -- it's worth the effort!	2004-12-14

I think the comparison is misguided. Certainly there are obvious similarities; but Gulley's stories have a crucial difference. Mitford, while idealized, is supposed to be a plausibly realistic place, with realistic people. Gulley, on the other hand, cannot keep himself from lapsing constantly into hyperbole for comic effect (sort of like Garrison Keillor's Lake Wobegon stories). This becomes apparent in just the first few pages of this book: Would a local beauty queen, asked to dress in a bathrobe to portray Mary in a Christmas pageant, really wear a revealing negligee? And would the church allow the pageant to proceed if she did? Would a church board member seriously propose that the church obtain W-2s of prospective members to evaluate their potential financial contributions? In both cases, of course not. <BR>Don't get me wrong -- I agree with other reviewers that the book is funny. It's just a different kind of book from Karon's; hers are gentle humor within a realistic framework, while Gulley's emphasize humor (sometimes to the point of wackiness) over realism.	2004-05-22

I agree with many of the positive and negative reviews of other readers -- so I'll average 5 stars and 1 star and give it 3.<BR>On the positive side, this is a very readable book because Bryson has a nice, straightforward, seemingly effortless style of writing. I'm not a hiker and have never seen the trail, but found the book to be quite enjoyable.<BR>On the negative side, the jeremiads about the disappearing trees and animals and the acid rain became more than a little tiresome. It's easy to wail and moan about this -- but what should be done about it, Bill? The implication was that &quot;someone&quot; should do &quot;something&quot; to stop it. What would that be? Lock down all woods/forests/lakes/mountains etc. and not allow people in ever again? Shut down all industry? Ban cars and highways? Quarantine the continent? (the chestnut trees were wiped out by an Asian parasite). A quote from the economist Thomas Sowell comes to mind: &quot;There are no solutions, only trade-offs&quot;. We can eliminate some of the problems Bryson notes -- but at what cost? Massive unemployment, a devastated economy? <BR>Summary: Enjoy the humor and descriptions of the trail.

The cover on this book is very misleading, showing children happily playing in the snow. In fact, the book is a description of an unbelievably long, devastatingly cold South Dakota winter in which the Ingalls family struggled for survival. This is a good book for a hot summer day -- just reading it will chill you down.<BR>My question is this: After the long winter finally ended, why didn't Pa Ingalls immediately load the family into a wagon and head for south Texas to grow grapefruit? Just kidding, of course, but as a life-long Texan I have a hard time understanding people who live in South Dakota today, with heated houses and cars. It boggles the mind that people lived there in Laura Ingalls' day, when they had to tie up bundles of straw to put in the stove and generate a paltry amount of heat to keep from freezing to death.	2004-03-14

My main complaint about this book (or series) is that the futuristic setting adds little; in fact, Nora Roberts' sci-fi elements seem to come more from The Jetsons than from current projections of the coming century. (For example -- flying cars and extensive space travel/colonization are both staples of old-style sci-fi, but are very unlikely to occure in the next half century). Eve Dallas could have been written in the present day and it would have worked as well.<BR>But speaking of Eve, I'm afraid she's about as stereotypical as they come. She's sharp as a tack; she's tough as nails; she's so dedicated to her job that she pays no attention to her personal appearance -- yet she's so gorgeous and sexy that every man she meets wants her. She's her own person -- except when she meets Roarke, then she seems more than willing to subjugate herself to him (but that's okay, because she's doing so voluntarily, you see -- she's still her own person and still in control of the situation. Because she's tough and capable... hmm, I'm starting to repeat myself). Even her name is hokey: \\"Eve\\" = pure woman, sexy; \\"Dallas\\" = tough, streetwise, perfect cop name.<BR>Then there's the writing style; I found it distracting that it's written in third person with insight into Eve's mind -- yet it slips from time to time into Roarke's mind.<BR>All this makes it sound as if I hate the book and the series. I don't, I think they're reasonably entertaining. You just can't take it very seriously.	2004-03-03

The characters and tone of this story were strongly reminiscent of those from three other authors: William Sleator, Madeline L'Engle, and Franklin W. Dixon.<BR>First, Sleator's \\"House of Stairs\\" explored a very similar concept (though without the religious element), and in general did it with better writing.<BR>Second, the atmosphere was in many ways similar to that in L'Engle's \\"A Wrinkle in Time\\".<BR>Which brings us to Dixon, of \\"Hardy Boys\\" fame. Elijah and Elisha are essentially a Christian, 21st-century version of Frank and Joe Hardy. They are smart (Elijah has actually memorized trig tables); they're courageous, often to the point of recklessnes; they are skilled at self-defense techniques; they know how to use gadgets and equipment (for Frank and Joe it was motorcyles and ham radios; for the Springfield twins it's computers and cell phones); they communicate with each other by secret family code. Definitely a Hardy Boys type feel to much of the story.<BR>The reason my title says \\"Bake 10 minutes at 250\\" is that I believe the overall concoction is under-cooked -- not as solid and finished as it needs to be in order to be considered a really good story. I agree with a previous reviewer who says the story is heavy-handed; does the whole family have to have Biblical first names? (And by the way, I assume the girl's name is pronounced \\"E-LEE-sha\\", since it would be pretty odd to pronounce it like the Old Testament male prophet's name). And the introduction of the number 666 at the end was over the top. As the other reviewer noted, if you're going to get across a Christian message in a kid's adventure story, you need to use some subtlety -- as C. S. Lewis did. Peretti is just too obvious.<BR>One more thing: There is a definite ideological bias in the public schools today. The education industry is actively inculcating in our kids such things as radical environmentalism, multiculturalism, and moral relativism. I'm vigilant about that ideology and make sure my two kids understand the threat of political correctness. But I think it's going a bit far to suggest that there might be a secret government project to abduct, brainwash, and perhaps even murder kids as part of an overt goal of eradicating religion and morality from the United States. I think Peretti could make his points with a little less conspiratorial (if not hysterical) approach.	2004-01-25

I suspect the ratings would break down largely along male/female lines.<br />I liked the premise: A man periodically, and uncontrollably, travels through time and space to places and events in his past and future -- frequently meeting the woman/girl who is/will be his wife.<br />Unfortunately, the premise is better than the execution. Until I was halfway through the book, I almost quit several times -- finally becoming hooked enough to ensure I would finish it. In long stretches of the story, not much happens.<br />The characters are problematic as well. I imagine that Henry is the author's dream man: slim, strong, sexy, a little wild. Likewise, Clare seems to be the author's idealized image of herself (read the description of Clare, then take a look at the author's hair in the dust cover photo). Other characters added little to the story; Gomez, for example, was probably just another of the author's sex fantasies put to paper.<br />Overall, the book was worth reading -- but by a narrow margin.<br />Note: another time travel story that is not science fiction, having some romance and some good historical information, is \\"Time and Again\\" by Jack Finney.	2004-01-13
US	39944106	R11D7XE681ISL7	0786867167	68096580	Tour '72	Books	2	1	1	N	N	Poorly written.	There are many problems with this book. <BR>1. Factual errors. Some have been pointed out by previous reviewers. Here are a couple more:<BR>- the difference between par and bogey was described as a \\"margin of two shots\\". <BR>- A player at the Masters was described as birdieing 14, 15, and then makings a putt for \\"his third birdie in a row on seventeen\\". Apparently he skipped 16.<BR>That's only a couple of mistakes, but add them to others I noticed plus others noticed by the previous reviewer, and this is a sloppy book.<BR>2. Redundancy. Twice we're told that Lee Elder expected an invitation to the Masters after winning the Nigerian Open. Twice we're given an account of Arnie blowing a 7-shot lead to Billy Casper at the '66 Open. I kept feeling that I'd lost my place in the book and accidentally started over on earlier pages. But it was just the author repeating himself for no apparent reason. <BR>3. Failed attempts to put the story into some sort of larger social context. The reader is treated (or subjected) to an endless stream of data -- much of it trivial -- about the societal events, politics, popular culture, economics, and non-golf sporting events of the era. The problem is that very little of it had anything to do with Nicklaus' pursuit of the Grand Slam, Palmer's waning career, Trevino's exploits, etc. The problem seems to be that the author couldn't get a book-length story out of the golf alone, so he padded (and padded, and padded) with extraneous stuff that is irrelevant to the story he's trying to tell.<BR>4. White liberal guilt. This is of course a virtual epidemic among sportswriters and other media types today. They pat themselves on the back, showing how unbiased they are by pointing out how biased other people are. So we find that Bobby Jones was racist, the Masters is racist, Gary Player was racist, Jack Nicklaus -- well, not sure about him but he was a privileged country club kid and that's pretty much the same as being racist. Again, little of this is relevant to the '72 season of Nicklaus, Trevino, et al, but by writing about it at length the author is able to show what a good, non-racist guy he is (and also pad the book some more to meet his word quota).<BR>5. Unoriginality. Something occurred to me in reading this: I believe the author might have been able to write it without ever leaving his office. Most of the information in it can be \\"Googled\\". Most of the rest is author's musings or conclusions. It's hard to find evidence of much real research or subject interviewing. In other words, it may be somewhat more sophisticated than a student paper that just regurgitates facts found in encyclopedias and magazine articles -- but not by much.<BR>Overall -- the book doesn't do justice to the players or the events of that great golf season.	2003-12-26

I like the whole Black Widowers idea, but the stories in this book -- and in the series as a whole -- are a mixed bag at best. Some of the mysteries, and Henry's solutions, are clever. Others are way too obscure. Example: To solve one mystery, Henry had to know not only an Edgar Allen Poe poem (not \\"The Raven\\"), but also the names of the stars in the constellation Perseus -- along with the meaning and derivation of the names. If Asimov had to stoop to such esoteric depths to come up with Black Widowers stories, that should have been a clear indication to him that he should discontinue the series.	2003-12-22

The actual game is covered in a couple dozen pages near the end. The rest of the book is, as the previous reviewer noted, filler. Examples: Several pages are devoted to Bubbles Cash, a forgotten, top-heavy Dallas stripper. What did she have to do with the Ice Bowl? Nothing. Midway through the book, the reader learns about Texas Stadium, and about overly privileged children from the affluent Dallas suburb of Highland Park. What do these have to do with the Ice Bowl? Nothing. The author drops names of Texas towns that (unless you're from the Dallas area) you've never heard of: Waxahachie, Wills Point, etc. What do they have to do with the Ice Bowl? Nothing. The book is absolutely crammed with extraneous material such as this. Also, the author's style is grating. Try this introduction to the account of the second half of the game: \\"The players were not certain whether the winners would be claiming the NFL championship or the Stanley Cup [reader can insert mental rim-shot here -- Bada-bing!]. Between periods, they [who -- the players?] should have brought out the Zamboni machine ...Instead of blowing that $80,000 on his underground dirt-warmer, Vince Lombardi probably should have intalled guardrails [Bada-bing!]. Any activity beyond the middle of the gridiron resembled the practice runs by the Jamaican bobsled team at the Calgary Olympics\\" [Bada-bing! Hey! I got a million of 'em! You folks from out of town?]. This sort of \\"I'm a humorous sportswriter\\" shtick is very tiresome. Especially if -- as in this book -- it's not even funny.<BR>If you can find the book at a library, pick it up and read the couple of short chapters on the game. You might pick up a little new information. Otherwise, find a copy of the Dick Schaap/Jerry Kramer classic \\"Instant Replay\\". Now THAT book is a 5-star.	2003-12-14

This is a short book, which is good because there's really not a lot of meat to it. It consists of the author's recollections of his uncertainty about his early career and his qualifications to be a physics researcher, interspersed with conversations with Richard Feynman and observations about Murray Gell-Mann. The book would have been better had it focused more on Feynman and Gell-Mann and less on the author's dope-smoking, garbage-collector friend Ray.<BR>It appears the author left the physics field, due to some combination of losing interest in it and being unable to find a research project that would justify his hiring by Caltech. He later wrote a screenplay that was never made into a movie (I believe thousands of people have done that); co-wrote a mediocre episode of Star Trek: The Next Generation; wrote a book I haven't yet read on the history of geometry; and wrote this modest book. All of this probably means he's accomplished more of note than I have, but probably considerably less than he had hoped as a young physics Ph.D.	2003-11-30

As other reviewers have pointed out, the basic theme has been done before, and done better (the non-fiction book &quot;Friday Night Lights&quot; is excellent). Though the story was quite readable, the mythic status of Coach Rake was marred by Grisham's hyperbolic stats. Yes, there are real-life high school programs that have had long win streaks and multiple state championships. But a team that registers a shut-out in every game of a season is a bit much. Likewise, an eight-year stretch in which the team &quot;easily&quot; wins every game and every playoff game, EXCEPT the championship which they lose EACH of those eight years? And the big game where the players, without coaches, rally from a huge half-time deficit despite being unable to use any pass plays, just because they're REALLY, REALLY fired up? Please. (Twice it is noted the refs &quot;could have flagged us for unnecessary roughness every play&quot;. Why didn't they?). The whole tale smacked of unreality. At least Grisham avoided the sappiness that would have ensued if Neely's childhood sweetheart had succumbed to his pathetic attempt to regain her love.	2003-11-28

There's nothing wrong with that per se; combining sci-fi with social-political views goes back at least to H.G. Wells, to a lesser extent to Jules Verne, and for all I know even before that. There's a catch, though: the sci-fi story must be good enough to stand on its own, without the political trappings. Such was the case with &quot;War of the Worlds&quot;, &quot;The Time Machine&quot;, etc. Such is not the case with &quot;Illegal Alien&quot;. The reader is subjected to a steady stream of the author's liberal political and social views, along with a wearying succession of pop culture references. In short, if you're a left-wing kind of person -- to the extent that you'll put up with a mediocre sci-fi yarn just to get your dose of liberal politics -- then this may be the book for you. All others, steer clear. And maybe re-acquaint yourself with a real writer like Wells.	2003-10-29

But there are dozens of stories in the world of golf more interesting, more engaging, more saddening or moving or inspiring than anything you've ever read about Tiger and his money and his girlfriend and his clothing. Feinstein captures some of those stories in this very readable book.	2003-10-10

One that I could have crafted if only I'd thought of it before he did. The formula is so simple: write a weepy, excessively sentimental love story. That's it. That's all it takes. Who buys books? Mostly women. What do they buy? Weepy, sentimental... well, you get it.<BR>This book isn't even well written (as one reviewer has pointed out here, the first-person protagonist starts out telling his story in teenage-speak -- even though he's now a middle-aged man). But all Sparks had to do was create a character who was so smitten with the ethereal girl that he NEVER got over her -- never even considered getting married or even having a relationship of any kind with any other woman as long as he lived. Voila -- his target audience is hooked. Sparks gets richer. I get more jealous.	2003-09-06

I hate to use hyperbole, because it will make me sound like a teenager (which I have not been for quite a long time); but I'll say it anyway: This is one of the greatest books ever written.<P>As others have pointed out (most of them criticizing), the author speaks VERY bluntly to teens. A big part of his message could be summarized thusly: \\"You, young person, think you know everything. You know nothing.\\" The truth of this statement should be obvious to everyone who has left the teen years behind (both chronologically and maturity-wise). I can only conclude that those reviewers who were offended by this message were either teenagers, or adults who have never grown up. To all others, Brain's thesis is so self-evidently true that no debate is needed.<BR>I also disagree with reviewers who believe Brain's value systems intrude. First, he did NOT say \\"sex is not an option\\" -- he said precisely the opposite, that it IS an option (then he explains why it is a bad choice from several perspectives, not just a religious one. In fact, the reader can infer that Brain is a Christian but it is not certain that's true; this book is not even remotely focused on a religious perspective).<P>In summary, this book is a treasure chest of helpful advice to teens. I only wish it had been available to me as a teenager.	2003-07-24

The biggest problem facing readers of popular fiction is that they can read faster than Clancy, Crichton, et al, can write. So they must turn to the second-team writers to fill in the gaps. <BR>After reading this book, I'd say Preston and Child are adequate second-teamers. The story is a good techno-thriller and the characterization isn't bad. I plan to give other Preston/Child novels a try.<BR>[For what it's worth, here's one thought that has occurred to me many times, and again on reading this book; is it possible to write a novel where the protagonist is male, and his co-worker or partner or person he runs into in the course of the story is female -- but she's NOT a babe? In other words, if I were to write a decent story, but I made the protagonist's partner a not-so-attractive woman with whom he doesn't develop a relationship -- would the story get published? Just wondering. The female partner in Mount Dragon is indeed a babe, so we don't find out the answer to my question here].	2003-06-22

The most striking feature of the show, however, is not the kids' talents but their parents' obsessions. They are trying to achieve vicariously, through their kid's success, the fame and fortune they were never able to achieve on their own. I think you probably get my analogy to Earl Woods.<BR>By the way: I have a point to make about Tiger that has nothing to do with this book, really, but that I want to get off my chest. It has to do with his wardrobe. He is in serious need of a fashion makeover. Here is his customary garb:<BR>1. &quot;Poofy&quot; (i.e., baggy-legged) pants. The effect is a little bit odd.<BR>2. A standard golf shirt -- but with the top, collar button fastened. This is a distinctly child-like feature; normally the only people with top button fastened are little boys dressed by their moms.<BR>3. A cap that is more rounded than that of other players; if you removed the bill and attached blades to the top, it would be a perfect propellor beanie.<BR>What I'm getting at is that his working clothes are childish. When combined with his natural baby face, the effect is comical. I predict that 20 years from now, film of Tiger in his 20s will look as silly as film of golfers in the 1970's with their tight, plaid pants, wide white belts, and super-sized lapels on their shirts. <BR>So Tiger -- please come up with a new look on the course to go with your fabulous game.	2003-06-18

That kind of thinking is a mistake. There is much that can happen in the next 17 months that could seriously weaken GWB: terrorist attacks on U.S. soil, continued weak economy, etc. If he becomes vulnerable, Hillary will jump in and take her chance. Even if she believes she has only a moderate chance of winning, she'll still run -- in order to set herself up for an even stronger challenge in '08 after GWB's inevitably weaker second term.

It was in my library's adult SF section, but its characters speak in the breezy style of his juvenile stories such as &quot;Tunnel in the Sky&quot; and &quot;Starship Troopers&quot;. Anyway, it doesn't matter.<br />This was a good, fun story. But I was surprised that at least one reviewer below says it stands the test of time; I hope the reviewer doesn't mean that Heinlein accurately portrayed the future. Writing in 1946, his forecast for 1970 wasn't very accurate -- much less that for 2001: &quot;grabbies&quot; replacing movies, antigravity devices, and time travel, among other things. But not only is there no internet -- people actually place phone calls by speaking to an operator!<br />I'm not criticizing Heinlein for missing the mark in predicting a future 55 years ahead; who could do that with any degree of accuracy? I'm just saying that in reading this novel, one is reading about an imaginary second half of the 20th century that is very different from reality. But if you can step into that imaginary history, this is a good, enjoyable read.	2003-02-09

There's no denying that Keillor possesses two gifts: a rare sense of humor, and that marvellous voice that was destined for radio.<br />Unfortunately, with success came change; the same change that overcame Bill Cosby, turning his once-charming sitcom into a  politically correct weekly lecture.<br />Likewise, Keillor apparently decided that with his fame and fortune came the obligation to make the world a better place by spreading the good news of liberalism. Hence his tiresome attacks against Reagan, Bush, et al. The sad thing is that before he was overcome by this sense of his own importance, he WAS making the world a better place - with gentle humor, good music, and good talk.

The first time I read the book, I agreed with them. But having read it again, I've changed my mind. More on that in a moment.<br /><br />When I read a Crichton story, I tend to enjoy the science, and theoretical ideas, more than the action parts. Jurassic Park, Timeline, Prey, and Sphere -- in all these stories, Crichton delves into some idea such as multi-dimensional space, cloning, nanotechnology, alien intelligence -- and his explorations of those ideas are, to me, very interesting. Not so interesting is when each of those books ends up as an action story, with people in great peril, with some of them dying. Timeline, for example: I find myself re-reading the parts where the theory of the multiverse, the descriptions of the machines, and the ideas of Stern to rescue his friends, are the focus. I skip over the sword fights and daring escapes.<br /><br />Same thing for Sphere. When Ted and Harry are debating about the Drake equation, time travel, nature of aliens (if any), etc., I am thoroughly involved with the story. When people start screaming and dying, I get pretty bored with it. Fortunately there is enough of the former that I enjoyed the story overall.<br /><br />Back to the controversial ending. Three of the main characters make a pact. Clearly, one of them keeps the agreement, and one does not. What I noticed on the second reading is that the third character, who I had assumed also kept the terms of the agreement, might not have. It's left unclear. This adds something to the story I missed the first time. And here's the main reason I don't mind the ending: If the events in this book were to happen, it seems to me the ending would be quite plausible. So I do not see it as a cop-out by Crichton.	2003-01-26

The problem with D'Este is that the spin seems inconsistent. Does he think that Ike was a brilliant leader or an indecisive incompetent? Apparently some of each. Would Montgomery, if given free rein, have ended the war sooner? According to D'Este, maybe -- and maybe not. Should Ike have more solidly favored Patton with logistical support at Monty's expense? Maybe, maybe not. Was Bradley overrated? Maybe -- etc.<br />Perhaps there's nothing wrong with this ambivalence; it would be absurd to rate Eisenhower's performance as Supreme Commander as either white or black; of course he will come out some shade of grey, with failures and setbacks to go along with sound decisions and triumphs. Whatever your opinion of Ike, Monty, Patton, and the rest, this book is fascinating reading for any student of the war.<br />(P.S. - I'm tempted to give another star, bringing it up to a General-of-the-army-5 star rating, just because D'Este had the guts to dismiss the Kay Summersby story for what it probably was: a man finding comfort in non-sexual companionship with a pleasant young woman -- a welcome distraction from the immense pressures and inherent loneliness of his job).	2003-01-10

The book was written about software development projects, but is absolutely loaded with insight not just on that subject, but on management styles and workplace conditions and rules. One can read this book and become genuinely excited about the potential explosion of productivity, hand-in-hand with employee job satisfaction, that could occur if managers would simply follow the advice given by the authors on how to be effective workplace leaders.<br />Alas, it probably won't ever happen. Several years ago, the large (Fortune 20) company I worked for brought in Timothy Lister to present the book and the ideas in it to management prior to the start of a major software project. Lister did an excellent job presenting his and DeMarco's philosophy. The managers nodded sagely and showed every sign of comprehending and accepting the concepts contained in the book. Then Lister left, the project started, and the managers immediately reverted to the old style: setting unrealistic deadlines, pressuring employees to deliver more and more in less and less time, and in general following every tired old management strategy that almost always leads to a failed project -- as indeed, it did in this case.<br />So read this book, learn from it, and enjoy it (it's an easy, entertaining read) -- even if your managers are too stupid to profit from it.	2002-11-03

It's one of those rare non-fiction books that is so skillfully written that one doesn't even need to have any interest in the subject matter to enjoy the book.<br />The grain of salt I referred to is this: undoubtedly there is racism in West Texas. How prevalent it is, I don't know. But it is pretty much a given that the author would focus on it as much as possible for dramatic effect -- even if it weren't all that pervasive.

What exactly did she see in him? What did Gary Morton think about this guy hanging around his wife all the time? Who knows?<br />The book's main flaw is that the author injects himself far too much into the story; and he does not come across as a particularly witty or charming man, although Lucy inexplicably finds him funny and fun to be around. But at that time in her life, she had become something of a frail, sad, even somewhat vulgar woman -- not much like her famous characters. <br />Anyway, if it had been more about Lucy and less about the author and his self-importance at being part of her inner circle, it would have rated more stars.	2002-07-13

But as far as I could tell, he was just a thief. The fact that he was smart, tenacious, etc., didn't change that.<br />2. Why did total strangers love him -- giving him special treatment at the hospital, constant favors, etc.? Grisham didn't give us any reason to understand why he elicited these responses from everyone he met.<br />3. Unlike some other readers, I loved the ending -- again, he was just a thief, and he may have charmed everyone else but didn't charm me, and the ending suited me fine.	2002-06-15
US	39944106	R30M1ODFQ3KOVA	0385424728	233513923	The Chamber	Books	2	2	2	N	N	This is an example of why Grisham is more popular than good.	Grisham was never really a good writer -- he just came up with a few good stories and told them adequately. In this book, he even failed at that modest aim.<br />The whole purpose of the book seems to be to give Grisham a forum for arguing against the death penalty -- though I'm not even sure about that. If that was his goal, he tried to accomplish it by making us sympathize with an old, sick man on death row. Sorry, but he was once a young, healthy murderer. Executing him sooner would have solved the old, sick man issue.	2002-06-15
US	39944106	RYZXP4OC9J8BA	0515125504	33146438	The Facts of Death (James Bond)	Books	1	4	6	N	N	Bad writing; bad story; just plain bad.	Recently I observed a fifth-grader trying out instruments for the following year's school band. The band director, trying to get a sense of the kid's musical aptitude, sang a series of varied notes to the kid and asked him to sing them back. The poor kid sang back exactly the same, flat tone each time. Apparently he was truly tone deaf, unable to distinguish a C from an F sharp from a B flat.<br />The people who are giving this book 5 stars are the literary equivalent of that kid. That anyone could put such a poorly written, unoriginal, and boring effort as this Benson story on the same level as any of the original Fleming books... well, I wouldn't have thought it possible. But then I didn't know anyone was as tone deaf as that kid. <br />I don't have perfect pitch, but I can tell the difference between two notes an octave and half apart; and likewise, I can tell the difference between a 5-star story like \\"Casino Royale\\" and a .005-star story like \\"The Facts of Death\\".	2002-06-14

Many years ago, while in my early teens, I stood in the Smithsonian (this was before the Natl. Air and Space Museum was built) and gazed in awe at the first airplane, suspended in its place of honor. THE FIRST AIRPLANE! How remarkable that such a fabulous historical artifact has been preserved. <br />Despite the somewhat odd focusing on Wilbur's and Orville's father, this book gives a good account of the lives of two brothers who epitomized what we Americans have always liked to believe about ourselves: that we are imaginative, clever, industrious, persistent, tenacious, equal to any challenge. Certainly that description can't fit all of us; but certainly it did fit these two national heroes.	2002-05-03

Hickam himself hints in a note at the beginning that he took creative liberties in writing the book. However, I think those liberties went beyond the level he implies. Example: On a particular day when he was 17, a certain girl at school wore a particular outfit. That evening, Homer ate a particular meal; worked a particular homework problem; had a particular conversation with his Mom; the next day, a different girl wore a different particular outfit; and it goes on and on, with Hickam recalling the most minute details of virtually every day of his high school years. I don't think anyone has such a detailed, day-by-day, minute-by-minute memory of things that happened 30 or 40 years ago. Also, do you really believe that Quentin came up with the ideas for both Velcro and pantyhose? Why, if only his friends hadn't changed the subject, he might have invented half the stuff we use today! And did Homer really plant the seed for JFK's land-a-man-on-the-moon-before-the-end-of-the-decade speech?Don't get me wrong -- it's a great book, and I'm sure it's MOSTLY a true story; you just have to realize it's a novelized true story, perhaps rearranged so as to maximize dramatic (and sometimes comedic) effect. Just take the details with a grain of salt, and enjoy the read.	2002-04-21

Gardner's attempts at Bond stories are uninspired at best, boring at worst. Benson's are downright pathetic -- unbelievably bad. But Amis' effort was, if not perfect, worthy of the standard Fleming set.	2002-02-02
