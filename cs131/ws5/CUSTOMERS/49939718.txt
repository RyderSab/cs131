Even if some of this stuff is true, it was a waste of time writing it.  It is just unbelievable.    I bought the book because I was fascinated by Rickman's three-dimensional portrayal of Snape in the Harry Potter movies.  The books are great.  And the character if wonderful to read.  On film I really feel a strong compassion for Snape.  I was hoping to get some insights into how an ugly, mean character can become so attractive.    There wasn't anything remotely interesting or believable in this book.	2005-09-27

My only complaint is that the book should be updated (though it doesn't seem dated at all) because it has a copyright of 1984.  I have to wonder what, if anything, has changed since then.  I love books written by academics that are written in plain English. <br /> <br />There are great tidbits about class scattered, or perhaps just tossed out, though out the book: like the fastest way to move up in class.  You'll have to read the book because I won't give it away.	2005-07-15

I guess real Preppies are slow to change.    Every few years I read through this book amazed at what I still can learn from it and, also, how some things never change.    Parts of the book are a little dated.  Many of the famous Preppies in the bio section have died.  Some schools have slipped while others need to be included in the Prep pantheon of education.    I would love to see an updated version of this brought out.    Those readers looking for more about upper class behavior should check out     Class : A Guide Through the American Status System by Paul Fussell (which is also a little dated.)    Simply Sophisticated: What Every Worldly Person Needs to Know by Suzanne Munshower (watch out for some glaring mistakes in this book as one other reviewer on Amazon points out.)

All of the characters -- except maybe Jerome -- were three dimensional (though even the real-life Jeromes are two dimensional).<br />I can't wait to read more books by these authors.  I'm surprised this is a first book by these authors.  While this was mentioned on the tv show the View as beach reading and chick lit, I would have enjoyed reading this over the winter holidays.

It's a great read for teenage girls and anyone who loves the TV show Alias that the novels are based on.  For an avid adult reader, this book can be finished in one sitting.  <br />Unlike the last installments where half the book is Sydney's adjustment to college life and the next part is the mission she goes on, this book is one seamless story -- which is because it revolves around a sorority from her college and the trip to Hawaii they go on.  I never pledged a sorority, never went to Hawaii, and never went skin diving; I enjoyed reading about Sydney doing all these things.	2003-06-10

The author has been able to write the wonderful characters as we see them on TV and DVD.  The action takes place during year 2 of the series; if storylines hadn't progressed on the show, this would have made a wonderful movie adaptation.  The dialog in the book is so faithfully written, that I could actually hear the characters' voices as I read.<br />The end was very exciting as all the disfunctional teamwork came together.	2003-06-10

It's easy to think that she's always been confident, skilled, and sexy; the author didn't take the easy way and showed us a Sydney that evolves into the susperspy we know now.  <br />The book is fun to read and probably meant for high school girls; anyone, however, can benefit from the inspirational transition from gawky, rejected 18-year-old to confident young woman	2003-02-27

I don't expect a lot from sci-fi tie-ins, and I usually skip them.  The Destruction of Illusions is really well written and renders the characters' dialog crisply.<br />There are many wonderful scenes such as the commendation over a fallen mercenary; Tyr's humiliation by a Nietzschean field marshal; the \\"dog house\\" scene with Captain Valentine, Rev Bem, and Harper -- to name a few.	2003-02-11

I love reading about the Qwill and the town of Pickax.  The quality of the writing of the 25th entry in the series is much improved over the recent entries.  This mystery revolves around an elderly woman returning to her hometown after spending 60 years in Hollywood, birdnapped parrots and the opening of the local opera house -- and, of course, the obligatory murder.  As you can expect, if you've been following the series, the murder plays second fiddle to the Siamese, Quill and the regular townfolk.<br />I never thought I'd see the direction that Polly's character decides to follow and I can't wait to read more about it in the next novel.	2003-02-11

The author spent so much time on CJ's crackpot personality, Shelby and Granny Ledbetter stories that she forgot she was writing a mystery. <br />CJ's stupidity as well as Abby's mother's (Mozella) just takes over the novel. It is impossible for Abby to get through her investigation without one or both of them running off at the mouth embarrassing her. I know that in the South they love their eccentrics, but in the North, those two are certifiable. <br />You have to wonder how Abby manages to stay in business when she can't recognize an obvious fake, and she actually yells at someone and chases him away when he's trying to tell her something. She also relies on her new assistant far more than she should so that she can conduct her nosey investigations. She's made both mistakes in previous novels.	2002-08-14

I remember reading all sorts of classics when I was in high school about dysfunctional heroes who end up failing.  This book was a pleasure to read.  The only thing not dysfunctional is the soul of the teenage heroine: she lives in chaos and lawlessness; she has a handicap that she constantly needs to compensate for.  Despite all that she becomes the leader and savior of a band of people.<br />I couldn't put the book down.  When I finished reading it, I felt inspired.  Next to this book, The Catcher in the Rye, Lord of the Flies and Brave New World pale by comparison.  I wish I had read The Parable of the Sower when I was a teenager -- even at 40, I got a lot out of it.	2002-08-08

The book is also about Clare Boothe Luce and Baldrige herself.  <br />My favorite parts were when Baldrige revealed her failures and how she overcame what she and her generation considered her drawbacks and failures. Baldrige is an inspiration.  I wish I had read this 30 years ago.  I would never have wasted so much time regretting not looking like the straight-haired, model-thin girls of my generation.  She inspires me now.  <br />Excerpts from this book should be required reading for high-school girls.  Every time I've been told no, I took it as final, door closed, you failed ...   After reading this book, it is obvious that there is a better way to view and handle life's setbacks and rejections.<br />And this book is a very good read about Jackie Kennedy and Clare Boothe Luce.	2002-07-29

Almost of all of the book is about American and English society during the Victorian period. The authors went out of their way to make the vast amount of material easy to read and very entertaining.<br />The differences in the upper class of both countries are contrasted in life styles, art, architecture, travel, marriage and courting customs.<br />This book is wonderfully presented with sidebar articles, minibiographies, drawings and photographs.

All of the regular characters are back except The Jerk who is serving time--if you haven't read the previous books, their relationships are all explained. Arch is about to celebrate his 15th birthday and is starting to show some unpleasant teenage materialism and angst - or is this the first glimpse we get into behavior inherited from his father, The Jerk.<br />The novel series was started before the JonBenét Ramsey murder and the Columbine High School massacre; yet even with the limited violence and gentle writing style, we get a peek into how the very rich and pampered (and the wannabees that surround them) handle their children (or are handled by them) and why these well-off communities are set upon by such unfortunate occurrences. I love reading about the rich and how they screw up. <br />I dreamt of chocolate and coffee the other night because of this book instead of murder and violence.	2002-07-01

Taking notes while reading the book also helps to identify the hundreds of ways we clue the rest of the world into our lower class origins despite our bachelors and masters degrees.	2002-06-14

With jobs so scarce lately, I thought I'd spend my time reviewing basic skills while I waited for the phone to ring. One of the skills employers and agencies test for admin jobs is spelling. When jobs are plentiful, who cares. I get 100% on word processing tests; I know how to use spell check. Since I have to compete for a limited number of jobs, I got serious about each test. <br />This book starts with a mammoth list of commonly misspelled words. It's great as a reference. Skip to the chapters with the rules. I did a read through followed by a close reading of the first three rules chapters. I got 100% on a computerized spelling test for business and legal terms today -- which didn't include the obvious words like mortgage, committee, bookkeeping, and government.

So long it can get confusing -- especially reading Gideon's journal entries -- but it is a really satisfying read.  I love the twists and turns the plot can take.  When I think I have it solved, another victim or fact comes to light to make me reconsider -- this is typical Elizabeth George and I love it.  Also on the plus side, we learn more about Constable Nkata.	2001-07-05

I just discovered this author last year so her last 9 or so novels are very fresh in my mind.  This one is the best (the others were wonderful too).  The beginning is so fast paced that I couldn't put the book down.  <br />I discovered this author on a web site for mystery books called stopyourekillingme.com which organizes authors, titles and sleuths by job, historical time period, location, and other characteristics and then when you find a book you'd like to read, it links you directly to its Amazon.com page.  Since I love Jerrilyn Farmer's Madeline Bean (she's a caterer, too) mysteries, that job category led me to Diane Mott Davidson.  Who'd have thought food service professions could be so exciting.	2001-04-06

I enjoyed reading them straight through, and they will be wonderful as reference guides for future books and when I reread the series.<br />The Fantastic Beasts book is a facsimile of Harry's own text book including the sly graffiti  while the Quidditch book is a copy of the actual Hogwarts library book including a curse that librarians everywhere wish they could put on their books.  <br />Speaking of libraries, most public libraries have incredibly long waiting lists for the Harry Potter series.  Getting extra copies of these two books as well as the books in the series would be greatly appreciated by public libraries, children's hospitals, and after-school reading programs.	2001-03-14

Also informative is the list of the different facets of class.  <br />Some of the author's opinions are a bit silly: her idea of an outfit for a specific occasion is too detailed with color combinations that may not suit everyone or may be too trendy; and then there is her opinion that one needs 10 of the 14 layers of class to actually have class--three of them require having or marrying money.  <br />Also, I'm not comfortable with the author's opinion that it is acceptable to have the rich person in the relationship to pay off your bills of the poorer one.  People with class have bad names to call poor people who expect remuneration from a relationship.	2001-01-13

This tape was really well written.  I always found the Constitution really boring in high school and college.  I wish I had had this tape then.  The female speaker was very easy to understand--I was able to understand this tape in the subway, on the street, and with background noise at work.	2001-01-11

The tapes, especially the one on wine, are packed with a lot of information.  There is no long drawn out time wasting introduction.  I look forward to listening to this tape over and over.	2001-01-10

I never read romances, but I enjoyed  Sharp Edges so much that I have read 10 more Krentz novels since.  Krentz's  writing style is crisp and easy to read.  The stories are about mature,  educated women and not starry-eyed, lithe heroines with heaving bosoms.  I  enjoy the mystery subplot that goes along with each romance.	2000-09-09

This story would have made great fiction; it definitely would make a  terrific movie. Even though the scandal is over 100 years old, the writing  is so lively and the story so intriguing, that there is a fresh feeling to  the book.  <br />I also enjoyed the glimpse into the foibles of the  aristocracy of the time.  The rich and arrogant always seem so out of reach  and inscrutable that it was entertaining to see that they can be scoundrels  and dupes.	2000-08-29

In the  beginning Verity lets Jonas force his way into her closed restaurant and  gives him a job even though she is fearful and suspicious of him.  <br />Jonas  later shows up at a nearby spa where the owners let Verity use the hot tub  after hours.  Jonas joins her in the women-only facility, climbs in with  her in his underwear, and starts fondling her.  I've never run into another  of Krentz's female characters that stupid.  It does get better toward the  end.  <br />The sequel, Gift of Fire, is much better. The only reason I read  it is that I bought the two books at the same time.	2000-08-26

I enjoyed this entree into the world of food preparartion by a chef.  I couldn't put it down.  It was funny and repulsive at the same time.  I am thrilled that those of us at the moderate- to low-income levels  can have a good laugh at those patrons who think this type of service (yet  have received it without knowing) is beneath them.  <br />I can afford this  book, yet I can't afford the price of a meal by the chef.  I think the chef  is pleased that I bought his book rather than the meal!	2000-08-01

I can understand why kids want to read these books over and over--the characters, plot and scenery are  vividly written.  If you can afford it, consider buying a second Goblet of  Fire as a gift for your neighborhood library which, I'm sure, will have a  tremendously long waiting list of children wanting to read this book and  the earlier volumes.	2000-07-12
