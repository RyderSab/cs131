For a children's book, it can capture even the adult imagination.  <br />The book starts off with the careful manipulation of eighteen people into moving into an apartment complex.  Of the eighteen there is a doctor, a restauranteur, a judge, a runner, and a birdwatcher.  But there is a also a bookie, a bomber, and, quite possibly, a killer.  <br />On a dare, Turtle Wexler agrees to spend the night in the Westing Manor.  However, that night is shortlived as the body of the deceased (and possibly murdered) Mr. Westing is found in the house sending Turtle running in fear.  But surprise of all surprises, the eighteen residents of the apartment complex have all been named as potential heirs to the Westing fortune -- but first they have to play The Westing Game.  <br />Paired off the group goes on their merry way searching for clues.  However, when the secretary's transcribed copy of the will goes missing and a mad bomber starts to terrorize the players the game takes a wild twist.  At the same time, though, you come to realize that there is a bizarre method to the madness behind the game.  People are being paired off for a reason.  From people learning to bond with others, learning about differences, learning to love, and learning to be loved, each pair brings its own special allure to the game.  <br />Now, I am not going to spoil the ending, however, I do urge you to read carefully if you want to figure out the big \\"whodunit.\\"  Just when you think the answer is there, there's a REALLY BIG monkey wrench thrown just to send you for a loop.<br />Although it's a mystery and there is talk of death, dying, bombs exploding, and you might have to explain what a bookie is to your child, this book really and truly captures the imagination of anyone who reads it and is truly a wonderful book.	2002-03-04

This book is ALL about making fake driver's license. <br />Granted this book goes into nice detail on how to design and make them but it fails to let you in on some details.  New York and Florida have PLASTIC driver's license.  With a Florida license it looks like a credit card with a black data strip in the back.  The police officers, when they pull you over, will swipe your card through their machines and pull up all of your information.  The idea was to save on time when pulling someone over to write up a ticket.  With New York licenses, the cards of made of a flexible plastic with the picture digitized on them.  Getting your hands on either of these materials would be highly difficult.  All it would take is one astute person from that state or someone who regularly sees multiple state IDs to catch on that its not a real ID.	2002-03-04

Information on how to fake references (as mentioned in other books) in order to obtain jobs as well as being able to sustain the new identity (in terms of back history, etc).

This book gives you a lot of information and some pitfalls to avoid.  Perhaps the best piece of advice it gave was regarding the Social Security number was that the first three digits relates to the state in which you \\"entered\\" the Social Security system and the second two digits relates to a certain year (or years).  It helps you avoid the pitfalls of being \\"caught\\" should someone have access to the necessary info.<br />However, what this book does not take into account is the advances in technology in terms of linking birth and death certificates in order to cut down on such things.  The book offers suggestions which would take quite a bit of legwork and involve more people than necessary should you think about attempting such a feat.	2002-03-04

As someone who has fell in love with one of his friends and had to live with the sting or rejection, this book was somewhat hard to read at first.  You root for them all through the novel to realize that they truly are a couple and have been for quite some time even if they don't realize it.  The two make a horrid pact to find the perfect mate and keep them for an extended period of time when they've had the perfect mate all along.  With two former loves from the past coming back into their lives, you have to wonder if they will get together at all.  Lisa Jewell's smashing novel covers all the basis of friendship into love and beyond with Thirty Nothing.  It's fabulous	2002-01-28

Then, on a layover in Charlotte, I picked it up again and said, okay...go for it.  I did.  And granted, although it was the same thing over and over I found warmth in these characters.  It seemed hard to believe that our heroine was a mere 25 years old as she acted more like 35.  It seemed hard to believe that she would be promoted to such a high position in her company after such a short tenure.  It seemed hard to believe that all of this was happening.  BUT(!) it was still engrossing.  You pull for this relationship because you want her to be happy.  Because Eben Strauss might actually be good for her.  Because you want to believe that love does conquer all.  Pink Slip was an adorable read full of family complications and love entanglements which despite (in my opinion) some pretty unorthodox plot twists shines through with a true story of love, friendship, the office, and how any two of those things shouldn't be combined.	2002-01-28

Remember the old adage about how two people from the same family can be so different?  Well how about five people?  <br />Miss Gussie, the matriarch, has two daughters -- Dorothy and Clancy Jane.  Dorothy is convinced that Clancy Jane is the apple of her mother's eye and nothing she does can or will be good enough to win her mother's approval.  So what does she do?  She sets out and makes everyone's life miserable and wonders why no one likes her or gives her the time of day.  Her husband leaves her, her kids desert her, and it drives her to the brink of insanity.  Just listening to her rant over the smallest of details is both sad and amusing.  Clancy Jane, on the other hand, is smart as a whip but winds up getting pregnant and having to marry young.  Her journey takes you from Tennessee to Louisiana back to Tennessee to California to Arizona and back to Tennessee all the while searching for herself while love is searching for her.  <br />Enter Bitsy and Violet, the daughters of Dorothy and Clancy Jane.  As with their mothers they are different as well.  Bitsy was supposed to be the popular girl in school, however, Violet entered and usurped her position much to the dismay of her mother Dorothy.  However, like Clancy Jane, she gets pregnant young as well and has to marry the baby's father while battling the raised noses of her new in-laws.<br />Violet, like her mother, is smart as a whip.  She advances a level in school to be in the same year as her cousin.  Perhaps the strongest (and albeit the youngest) of the six women, Violet must come to terms with her bizarre family history while finding her own place in the world.  <br />Queenie, the family retainer, is always there to bring the story back into focus.  As a non-member of the family, her third party perspective puts the missing ties in their place and completes the story.  <br />Crazy Ladies is another gem from Michael Lee West.	2002-01-25

From one sister who was almost killed to one sister who is almost afraid to step out the front door to another in a precarious marriage, West weaves the tapestry of this story like no other author can.	2002-01-25

Coming from a VERY Southern family, West knows not only how to capture the voices of the South but how to put pen to paper to make them come to life.  Each distinct voice (and trust me, they are VERY distinct) is followed by a chapter written in the third person to give the reader a fully omnipotent view of life in Limoges, Louisiana.  From Dee Dee Robichaux (the town tramp) to Vangie Nepper (the wife of the husband that Dee Dee is sleeping around with) to the battered Sophie, this is an absolutely wonderful detour through the world of the South.	2001-12-27

This places a huge emotional strain on her as she recently suffered a miscarriage.  <br />Enter Detectives Lynley and Havers on the scene.  (This book also explores their personal lives outside of the crime scene as you get a very clear dichotomy of their social standing -- Lynley with his fine house and surroundings; Havers with her aging and ailing family members.  This was heavily debated in our class and it was interesting to see how George pulls it off so well.)  They explore the inner sanctum of the all-boys school and learn more than they expected (although something tells me Lynley already knew what to expect and just didn't want to mention it) along with some more than suprising twists that left many a jaw on the floor.  <br />Elizabeth George has always had a deft handling of her characters and their emotions and this book is no different.  With this book, she really hit her stride.	2001-12-16

A sweeping mystery that shows off the true power of Chicago money, power, and politics.  From V.I.'s apartment to a modernized prison to the fashionable upscale neighborhoods, each new location is brought to vivid detail.  In this book, you really wonder who the true victim is?  Nicole Aguilando?  Robbie?  V.I.?  All of the above?<br />It starts off simple enough.  V.I. is invited to a party featuring the latest action film queen.  At the party, she is approached by a childhood friend of the superstar who has more than a few questions on his mind.  It sounds simple to start off....right?  But, when Victoria Iphigenia Warshawski heads home, she finds Nicole Aguilando lying in the street, badly beaten and clinging to life, her entire world is turned upside down.  To top it off, she is wearing a shirt with the action queen's image on the front.  Nicole was in prison for stealing a valuable necklace from her employer.  Who was her employer?  W.I.'s direct competition -- the president of Carnifice Security.  Nicole succumbs to her injuries but that doesn't answer how she got out of prison in the first place.  Enter a slimy Chicago cop who wants nothing more than to pin something (ANYTHING) on V.I. to put her away.  <br />With more twists and turns than you can imagine, V.I. befriends the son of her opponent and even goes to jail for protecting him.  It's there she learns about the new jail system and what power and money (and a little political greasing) can accomplish.<br />A highly recommendable action packed read.	2001-11-03

There are many factual errors based upon what was shown on TV and many typos (most notably when referencing the final tribal council where Richard Hatch was awarded the million dollar prize, Burnett wrote that Susan Hawk was preparing a speech where she compared Richard to a snake and Susan to a rat.  Kelly was the one she referred to as a rat in her speech.).  Although the book is highly informative and gives a new insight into the show, you can tell that Burnett did have an affinity for some of the cast members and a not-so-cheery attitude about others.  In describing Stacey Stillman's exit from the game, he portrays her, pretty much, as an obnoxious brat.  <br />It's not the greatest thing since sliced bread but it will give you a new dimension in which to enjoy the game.	2001-09-19

I know it's fiction and I know that we're supposed to suspend our belief system a bit but I couldn't go THAT far with this book. Sigh...I hope there is another to make me happy...	2001-08-29

My goodness...this man must have been following me around documenting my life (yes, I had the troll doll in my cube). From how to pick a roommate to the style of roommate and what to expect from a little old lady landlord (who I happen to have, and she talks to shrubbery, but doesn't charge me the $19.99 for rent as advertised in your book). It's the perfect book to give someone who is graduating college -- or even before!	2001-08-29

Well you can't really...In a nutshell, Craig Clybourn leaves his nice job as a cruise director to move to L.A. to be with his friend, sitcom star Dandy Rio who gets him in some of the oddest situations imaginable. From stealing fish from Tina Louise's koi pond to sleeping Alicia Silverstone a copy of his screenplay with the words, &quot;Your boyfriend does it with watermelons&quot; imprinted on the front to falling in and out and love (or maybe lust) over and over. Let's just say you may have a new affection for the McDonalds Playland after this...and a new understanding for how some pageant winners are picked....	2001-08-29

When I moved to NYC, I was given all six Tales of the City books as a present. I would read them and immediately recognize myself as sort of the little lost lamb. For five books, I loved her. Now I hate her. How could you make me hate her?!?!? But I am so glad you did...made me take another look at her and what she is supposed to be made of. However, I think the most enduring person is Anna Madrigal. Finally finding love in Greece (she predicted it in an earlier book) and Mona coming back after being gone for so long. Sigh....it's not the best of the bunch but the door is left opento pick up for a seventh installment...just to see if Mary Ann gets her comeuppance.	2001-08-29

Lynley, who is known for his female conquests as much as he is for his great detecting skills, is paired up with Havers.  Havers is pretty much assigned to him since the heads at Scotland Yard pretty much know that he won't sleep with her given her position in life and her physical state (she's not the greatest looking thing in the world).  <br />Havers doesn't take well to Lynley's leadership.  In fact, she resents it. The entire thing is complicated by the fact that the leading suspect isn't speaking.  Not just to them but to anyone.  Havers needs to prove herself to Lynley and Lynley needs to learn how to work with his new compatriot.  <br />This is truly a great debut novel that should not be missed.	2001-07-03

How can he proceed it this case when the result may mean breaking Lady Helen's heart?	2001-07-03

The father of one of the deceased also turns out to be one of Lynley's former colleagues.  With Havers taking things into her own hands and Lynley trying to keep his anger to himself, the two learn that they have faced the same demons in the recent weeks and now they can both understand each others motives.  This is a must read book.	2001-07-03

As you will learn through reading the book, there are several instances of mere chance where a person was given the opportunity to disappear and took advantage of it.

Having found nothing else that even came close to piquing my interest, I paid for the book and ran to catch my flight.  For the next two hours, I was grinning, laughing, and having a grand time with two of the most imaginative characters in the most glamourous of situations to the point that *I* was jealous of them.  Yeah, yeah, they're fictional characters but the panache they pull off when ordering Bombay Sapphire Gin Martinis....buy this book, make a pitcher of Bombay Sapphire Gin Martinis (or Long Island Iced Teas) and lose yourself in this book.  I *dare* you to read between the lines on some of these characters!  I know I did and it made it all that much more enjoyable!	2001-06-21

Your personal life will constantly be examined, reexamined, and every facet of your life will be painfully detailed. This is not an easy task as shown by Debb Eaton during the finale. For her, the scrutiny she faced was not worth the three days she spent in the Outback. In her book, \\"Walk of Fame,\\" Sharon Krum takes a deft jab at the world of manufactured celebrities and the media that feeds into them. It's a handbook for all budding superstars who want reality TV to be their next step to stardom. <br />Tom Webster is an unassuming writer for a financial magazine whose love of history has left him wondering if he shot a president if anyone would know who he was. His wife left him a year ago for his best friend and his weekly 800-word column hasn't won him fame or fortune but all of that is about to change. For $100,000, Webster must make himself into an overnight celebrity and then write an article detailing his meteoric rise to stardom - exposing himself as a fraud while simultaneously exposing the dark underbelly of the media machine. Aligning himself with Hollywood bombshell Alexandra West (who feels she is in need a makeover in order to be taken seriously by the Hollywood machine), the duo become the topic of conversation in gossip columns all over the country. In turn, his mother worries, his friend (yes, the one who stole his wife) fumes, his wife seethes, and the public hungers. The offers of book and television deals come fast and furious as well as the comely smiles and winks from women that wouldn't have given him a second look prior to Alexandra West. <br />Sharon Krum deftly writes through the voice of a man. So well, in fact, you forget that it's a woman writing the novel. There are several laugh out loud moments when the utterly unexpected happens and severalmoments when you actually feel for Tom. Has he gotten himself in over his head? \\"Walk of Fame\\" is a wonderful expose on the power of the media to take an ordinary man and make him into a star. Not only does the fame affect the person, but their friends and family as well. The pressure that all quarters feel is overwhelming as the media clamors for more information about the lowly financial columnist who is now the talk of the nation. The cynicism with the search for fame and the problems it brings shows the barebones reality of being a celebrity. This book truly answers the question, \\"At what cost fame?\\" <br />So, before you send in that application to be a contestant on the next reality show, check out \\"Walk of Fame,\\" currently available in bookstores and on Amazon.com. Know what you are in for before it actually happens.	2001-05-15
