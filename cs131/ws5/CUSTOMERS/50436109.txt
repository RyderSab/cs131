He has plotted, and planned, replotted, and replanned each and every nook, cranny, and nail that would go into building his ranch.  He has worked hard, for many years, to get the money together to make this dream come true, on the land that he had placed a claim to many years before.  Finally he has it all together, and can now join his friend, Wiley Carr, at the ranch.  Wiley has worked with Jason pulling together the plans, over the years, to make this dream come true.<br /><br />As Jason travels over the mountains to get to his  ranch, a gang of thugs, who inform him that they work for The Green River Cattle Company, overtake him. Jason is told that his ranch is no longer his, one of the workers is dead, and that Wiley was shot and ran off with another worker.  They are either dead, or soon will be. Green River offers him two hundred dollars for the buildings that have been built on the property.  Jason declines the offer, and is then beat up and left in the snow.  They also run off his horses, and destroy all of his provisions.  When Jason finally manages to come to, he gathers what is left of his provisions, and finds his horse, which for some reason had been saddled.  His guns and bedroll also put in place on the horse.<br /><br />Winter is starting to show it's savage brutality.  But Jason decides that he is not going to give up his ranch without a fight.  Before he can start fighting for his ranch, however, he must find Wiley, or at least his body, and the other worker who took off.  Snow is falling and the cold is getting bitter.  If Jason doesn't find Wiley, and the other worker soon, he won't be able to.<br /><br />While gathering provisions, to replace the ones that were destroyed, Jason meets the brother of the worker that had been killed by Green River. He also befriends an old Buffalo hunter, Kinnon, who once knew his uncle.  Jason and Swede track across the mountains, in the heavy snow, to hopefully regain Jason's ranch.  Kinnon will follow later to help the men.<br /><br />Along the way they come across a father and his daughter, Avram and Sarah Kleinfeld, who are stranded in the snow.  They were on their way to San Francisco, to escape the atrocities of Eastern European persecution of the Jews, when the wheel on their pushcart broke.  Jason can't leave them behind to die, and so, reluctantly, they take them along with them.<br /><br />What happens from here is both frustrating, terrifying, and an adventure into the human spirit.  A trip that will both engage your imagination, and leave you breathless.<br /><br />Ms. Parker has woven a story of intrigue, adventure, and heroism that will take you on a breathtaking trip through the High Mountains of Montana.  Her descriptions of the mountains, and their beauty are awesome.  She uses words to describe the treachery and danger in this beauty in such a way that you feel that you are actually right there.<br /><br />WINTER KILL is a study in humanity, and the love of a people for their culture, as well as the adventure of man against the elements.  WINTER KILL is a masterpiece of emotions, desires, and true love of a country that only someone who actually felt these could convey.<br /><br />I absolutely loved WINTER KILL, and recommend that everyone read it. You will be in awe of the beauty that Ms. Parker so aptly describes, as well as the hidden danger that lies beneath this beauty.  You will cheer Jason on as he fights for his dream.

US	50436109	R7MUDUOP2PYTH	159279968X	397215328	Second Generation	Books	5	2	2	N	N	SECOND GENERATION	I have read each and every one of Beth Anderson's books, and I could not tell you until last weekend which one I liked the most.  That was when I opened the pages of SECOND GENERATION and was transported into the most amazing world.  Ms. Anderson has a way of drawing you into the story, and keeping you there.  When you get to those last pages you actually wish that you had read slower so that the experience would last longer.  It is sort of like Christmas.  The getting there is fantastic, and then when Christmas day arrives you don't want it to end.  That is the way Ms. Anderson's books are.  All of them.<br />However, SECOND GENERATION is far more than that.  It is Christmas, New Years, and the Fourth of July, all wrapped up in one.  SECOND GENERATION is absolutely spell-binding.  Ms. Anderson's characters not only live and breathe; they leap off the pages into your lap.  The story is not only gripping, but it also gets into your heart and soul and you feel it simmering until it builds into a full-blown firestorm.<br />SECOND GENERATION is not only as good as any book a New York publishing house puts out, it is better than a lot of them.  There are very few books that I can say this about, but I have no qualms about saying this about SECOND GENERATION. Ms. Anderson has blown herself away with this book, and believe me that is very, very hard to do, as she was already on top with her previous work.<br />SECOND GENERATION opens in Columbia, South America in 1937.  Emelio Castivenette has talked Michael Shaunnessey into helping him search for an emerald mine.  His father found the emeralds in the Andes years earlier and had to abandon them.  He told Emelio all about the mine and where to look, and Emelio is determined to find it.  But in order to do this, he needs financing and help.  Michael can provide both.<br />Michael just can't keep up with his wife's spending.  Daisy can spend money faster than Michael can possibly make it.  And so when Emelio tells him about the emeralds, Michael decides that he will invest in the hunt for the emerald lode.  When they find it, they will split the take 50/50.  However after three months of searching the money runs out, as does Michael's faith that there ever were any emeralds.  Then on the last day of their search they find them.<br />As time goes by, and she gets older, Michael takes his young daughter, Leigh, with him to Columbia, while he works the mine.  Unlike her mother, Daisy, Leigh loves being in the jungle.  She is also infatuated with Emelio's son, Girardo.  Without a mother to watch over him, Girardo has run wild his whole life.  His father is never around to watch what his son is doing.  He is either busy working the mine, or is drinking and Girardo is pretty much on his own, running with the dredges of society.  Soon as fate would have it, Leigh's infatuation with Girardo is taken advantage of, and she becomes pregnant at the age of thirteen.<br />Daisy and Michael decide that it would be best if Leigh went away, had the baby, and give it up for adoption.  Young ladies didn't get pregnant in 1948, especially young ladies who were members of high society.  And high society is exactly where Daisy feels she belongs.  Leigh's pregnancy would not only ruin Leigh's life, but more importantly Daisy's standing amongst the elite of San Francisco.  As far as Daisy is concerned, that would end her life.  With that decided, Leigh goes to a home in Switzerland and has her baby, with no one knowing about it; not Leigh's best friend Bootsie, not even Gerardo.  The Chinese couple, Yan and Loo, who live in the Shaunnessey house as servants, adopt the baby as soon as it is born.  This is good because Yan and Loo want a baby so badly, and can never have one of their own, and Michael doesn't want his grandchild to disappear from his life.  Leigh doesn't know how she feels, except she knows that she can't raise a baby at her age, and she has big plans for her future.  A child will not fit into these plans at all.<br />After the baby's birth, Michael decides that he wants revenge for his daughters honor.  He feels that Leigh's pregnancy wasn't completely Girardo's fault.  He believes that Emelio had more to do with it than Girardo since he is his father and is responsible for the young man. Michael is also supposed to be Girardo's best friend.  And because of this friendship Michael feels like he has been deceived and therefore he will get revenge.<br />SECOND GENERATION is absolutely amazing.  It is full of love, deceit, revenge, hatred, romance, high-level politics, drug lords, high society, and much more.  SECOND GENERATION takes you into the drug cartels, the elite of San Francisco, and even the White House.  Family secrets abound. There are sex-crazed Senators, a jewel theft, and even murder.  And there is love.  A love that cannot be destroyed............or can it?<br />Ms. Anderson has written such a winner with SECOND GENERATION, that there is absolutely no one that won't be drawn into the story, and kept captive until they come to the most beautiful, and completely surprising ending a person could ever dream of.  One that you will not believe until you read it.  Ms. Anderson has written truly from the heart on this one, as she has with her other books.  However this time there are no holds barred.  She bares it all.  Her characters breathe each and every breath that Ms. Anderson put into them.  They are alive and leap into your heart and soul as no others can.  And that is much to the delight and wonderment of the reader.<br />SECOND GENERATION is one of the best books that I have ever read.  And Ms. Anderson is definitely one of the best authors to be read.  I cannot recommend too much that you get a copy of SECOND GENERATION as soon as possible.  Because when you do, you are in for the treat of your life.

US	50436109	R1DSKXQBN8QU00	0595265413	433353731	Alex 'n Bender	Books	5	1	2	N	N	ALEX 'N BENDER	ALEX 'N BENDER is another fantastic book from the very gifted author, C.H. Foertmeyer.  Mr. Foertmeyer just keeps coming up with one right after another, and I hope that he doesn't stop for a very long time.<br />Alex Carey is dead.  Of that his best friend, Bender Baxter is sure.  He saw it with his own eyes.  Alex had jumped off the cliffs into the water, and did not surface.  Bender jumped in and finally found Alex anchored to the river bottom, and although using every bit of strength that he could master, he could not free him.  Alex was dead, and Bender knew it.<br />After finally summoning help to the area, Bender knew that they would find Alex, but it would be his body.  It had been over twenty-four hours, and besides he had seen Alex dead under the water.  He was completely heartbroken, but they had to retrieve the body, and Bender knew where it was.  Or did he?<br />Meanwhile, soon after Bender dove into the icy water to help Alex for the last time, and had left to summon help, Alex woke in a dark cave.  There was nothing around him except for a small fire, and even that didn't light up the darkness around him.  He remembered drowning, and Bender trying to save him, and couldn't figure out what in the world was going on.  Alex tried to light a torch and explore his surroundings, however the torch wouldn't stay lit long enough to see much of anything.  Finally giving up he went back to the fire, and promptly fell asleep.  When he woke again he found that someone had killed, dressed, and put a rabbit on a spit for him to eat.  After eating, he fell asleep again to wake to a shimmering light coming from the river of water running through the cave.  After much consideration he figured that was the only way out, and dove into the water, and swam in the direction of the light, to surface again in the river.  The river current being so strong, it pushed him onto a sand bar, where he lay unconscious until Bender and the rescue crew finally found him, alive.<br />Bender is totally dumbfounded.  Although completely, and utterly ecstatic that Alex is alive, he can't believe it.  After all he saw with his own eyes that Alex was dead.  There was absolutely no mistake about that.  After Alex is treated and able to tell Bender what happened, the boys decide that they are going to investigate this phenomenon.  Bender's mother had told him the story about an old hermit, Jubel Owens, that lived on the other side of the river, in the wilderness, and Doc confirms this story.  Although Doc thinks that this old man has to be dead.  After all, he would be 85 by now, and hadn't been seen in town, getting supplies, for a long time.  Alex and Bender decide that they are going to hike over to the other side of the river and find old Jubel so Alex can thank him for saving his life.  Jubel has to be the only explanation as to how Alex got free, and was saved.<br />After getting enough supplies to last them a couple of days, Alex and Bender head off to find old Jubel.  Meanwhile unbeknownst to them, two boys, Dirk and Carter, who have been tormenting Alex and Bender off and on for quite a while, decide to follow them.<br />The woods on the other side of the river are quite different than the ones on the side where the boys live.  Although only a few miles from home, on that side of the river the woods are virgin, very thick, and with overgrown foliage.  But that doesn't stop Alex and Bender.  They are determined to find old Jubel.  And it soon looks like they may have done just that.  After spending their first night in the woods Bender wakes to find a man sitting by the fire petting Snitch, Benders dog.<br />ALEX 'N BENDER is absolutely wonderful.  As with other books that Mr. Foertmeyer has written you cannot put it down.  It is written so simply, and yet with so much heart and soul that the reader finds himself in the story, actually seeing the beautiful scenery around him.  The characters are so realistic that you actually feel their breath onyour skin.<br />The only problem that one may find while reading ALEX 'N BENDER is that Mr. Foertmeyer has tried to demonstrate to the reader the actual language of the Atiri.  He has written their thoughts in English, but spelled the words backwards, in order to demonstrate their true language.  Although this is different, it certainly isn't that difficult to follow, once you get the hang of it.  And in my opinion has added a lot to the feelings of the story.<br />Mr. Foertmeyer gained my appreciation, and admiration of his writing abilities with the first book that I read, CARVER: HIGH MOUNTAIN TRAGEDY, and ALEX 'N BENDER only solidified it.  He is a master of the art, and continues to completely thrill me with his work.  ALEX 'N CARVER is another masterpiece and will completely engage any reader in the first chapter, carrying them through to the last page.<br />Although he is a talent unto himself, and I don't normally like to compare one authors talent with another, I cannot help but be reminded of Samuel Langhorne Clemens when I read Mr. Foertmeyer's work.  He writes in much the same fashion, and I honestly believe some day Mr. Foertmeyer's work will be thought of as the modern day Samuel Clemens.<br />I completely recommend that you get a copy of ALEX 'BENDER immediately, and prepare yourself for a ride into a wonderful world, one that you will not want to leave.  One that will leave you waiting, and hoping, for another world that Mr. Foertmeyer takes you into again, soon.breath on your skin.  <br />The only problem that one may find while reading ALEX 'N BENDER is that Mr. Foertmeyer has tried to demonstrate to the reader the actual language of the Atiri.

US	50436109	R3SR7BFF0UKA1C	1932211039	665365612	Pieces of Sand	Books	5	0	0	N	N	PIECES OF SAND	This book-reviewing thing is getting more, and more difficult.  Not because the reading is hard to do....that is a pleasure...but how does one put into words just how great, and wonderful a book is?  Words just seem so insignificant after reading something as riveting as PIECES OF SAND.  But somehow I will try, as I want everyone to know about this book.<br />When Mr. Savoie asked me if I would like to read a book he had written about a \\"seriously deranged serial killer\\", I laughed and told him that I had always felt any serial killer would be considered deranged.  Little did I know!<br />I do have one warning; it would be to your advantage to stay away from South Seventh Street, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.  Especially if you are a young business man who happens to carry a brief case.  It seems that such young men are disappearing.  Disappearing, literally right in front of people's eyes.  And there are no clues as to where they are going, or what is happening to them.  But whatever is happening to them cannot be good.<br />In South Florida, Sheriff's Detective Charley Banyon has set up a special investigative unit that is making catching criminals a lot easier.  He has four first year rookies to train in this new approach to policing, and they aren't so sure that they like the idea.<br />A short time earlier Charley had met a wonderful woman.  He had been in a boat on Lake Okeechobee, when a violent storm suddenly came up.  June Ibson's kids found him on the shore of the lake.  He was more dead than alive.  After Charley recovered from his wounds, he wanted to thank the children for saving his life.  It was then that he met their mother, June.  Maybe it wasn't love at first sight, but it was close enough for Charley and June.<br />Soon after Charley and June met, June received a phone call from her father in Philadelphia saying that her mother was dying, and that her sister's husband had come up missing.  Jack Donlan was closing an insurance deal on The Seventh when he disappeared.  The police won't help, as there is no evidence of foul play.  June doesn't want to leave Charley behind in Florida, especially since they are just beginning to know one another, but she has to go to Philadelphia to be with her mother, and try and help her sister, and father.<br />In Camden, New Jersey, another young man is just starting to make a life for himself in the diamond business.  Johnny Nelson is working his way up in the company, and likes the work he is doing.  Although at times thoughts of getting rich quick go through his mind, he never follows through on any of them.<br />Mr. Savoie has brought together characters from different parts of the country, from different backgrounds, and with different interests into a mind-blowing story that you cannot stop reading.  PIECES OF SAND is a skillfully written and compelling story.  His characters are living, breathing, people whom you just have to know more about.<br />When I read Mr. Savoie's first book The Pracktl Affair, I honestly thought that he could never top himself, as it was such a great book.  But he has outdone himself with PIECES OF SAND.<br />PIECES OF SAND is a psychological thriller that draws the reader into the dark and evil mind of a serial killer.  A serial killer who perhaps is justified in feeling the way that he does, or perhaps is so sick that he can't control what he does, or perhaps just plain evil.  You make up your own mind on that one, but believe me which ever way you go, you aren't going to forget him for a very long time.  The story is spell binding and totally captivating.<br />PIECES OF SAND is destined to make it to the top.  This story is so well written, and so well thought out that it cannot do anything other than that.  Mel Savoie has a very, very bright future for himself in the world of best sellers.  I certainly hope that he presents us with a lot more of his work.  He definitely is first class, and I absolutely want to read more, and more, of hiswork.  You will too.  Especially after reading PIECES OF SAND.more, of his work.  You will too.   Especially after reading PIECES OF SAND.	2003-02-07

The writing is absolutely wonderful.  Mr. Rawls' humor and wit shows through in the first chapter, and continues to pull you in as you turn the pages.  The more you read the better it gets.<br />Arthur Conan Edwards, otherwise known as Ace, is a P.I. in Dallas, Texas.  Ace used to be a  cop, but thought that he could make more money as a private detective.  And so after a divorce from his college sweetheart, he retired from the Dallas police force and used his small retirement to open up a one-man detective agency.  His main source of income consists of chasing around errant spouses and getting the goods on them for divorce cases.  Not much money, however it does pay the bills......... somewhat.<br />A case Ace handled three years prior involved a multimillionaire, (sort of) friend of his, Jake Adams, from his hometown of Cisco.  Jake needed the goods on his wife, Sheila, to hopefully cut down on the amount of money he would have to pay her in their divorce.  However even with Ace's help Sheila managed to get the one and only thing Jake loved the most, even more than all the money he had.  She got the house.  The house that Jake himself had designed and built.<br />Three years later, the phone rings in the middle of the night.  It is Jake.  It seems someone burned his, or rather Sheila's, house down and he wants Ace to find out who did it.  Ace isn't that interested in getting involved with the whole thing at all.  However, when Jake offers to pay him enough money to pay off all of his outstanding bills, and set him up for a while, how can Ace turn the guy down.  So it is off to Cisco he goes.<br />Ace hasn't been in town long when he discovers that there were two people killed in the fire.  One of them has to be Sheila.  But who is the other one?  And which one was the killer after?<br />Although having had been raised in Cisco, Ace isn't finding it very easy to be accepted back, or having much luck getting answers from the people who knew Sheila.  However one guy finally decides he can trust Ace, and agrees to help him in anyway he can.  Bubba is totally grief stricken at the thought that Sheila has been killed.  He was totally, and completely in love with her. In fact Bubba was the reason for Sheila divorcing Jake in the first place.  Bubba decides that he will hire Ace to find Sheila's killer.<br />Ace tries to explain to Bubba that he is already working for Jake, and cannot work for both of them.  Bubba is completely devastated, and besides he doesn't seem to have all his oars in the water anyway, and doesn't seem to either understand, or want it that way.  After  arguing the point for some time, Ace finally gives in and tells Bubba he will work for both him and Jake.<br />However, it looks like someone is not about to let Ace find out who burned down Jake's house, or who killed Sheila, and the other victim, or why.  Things turn from bad to nasty.  And then it gets even worse.  Murder, threats of murder, and threats of physical harm seem to fly.  But it is still difficult to figure out just who is the target of all of these threats.  Whoever is that target, Ace always seems to be in at the center of it.<br />In the middle of this entire mess Ace falls in love.  Head over heels, madly in love.<br />All of this is being closely observed by a couple of curious, cantankerous felines who are Ace's confidants.  Sometimes Ace finds he needs to talk things over, and Striker and Sweeper make a good audience.  I'm not sure that either of them really cares, but they do seem to help Ace work out things, nonetheless.<br />JAKE'S BURN is fantastic.  The writing is smooth, full of tongue in cheek humor, as well as lightening fast suspense.  All told from Jake's point of view.<br />JAKE'S BURN is full of action, adventure, love, and murder, all intertwined with the wittiest humor you can imagine.  Mr. Rawls will have you sitting on the edge of your chair one minute, and the next rolling on the floor laughing your head off.  At the very least you will chuckle as Ace tries to sneak into his own home without being assaulted.<br />I totally recommend JAKE'S BURN to everyone.  It is a story you can't miss, by an author you won't want to miss.  Now or in the future.  Mr. Rawls is around to stay for a very long time, and I don't plan to miss one word that he writes.  And neither should you.you sitting on the edge of your chair one minute, and the next rolling on the floor laughing your head off.

First it was The Gunn of Killearnan, and then she did it again with Unlawful.  Now she has not only done it again, but she certainly has clinched her number one spot with SARATOGA SUMMER.  I don't know how she continues to do it, but I certainly hope that she never stops.<br />I guess I'm just fickle.  I fell in love with Gerek in the Gunn of Killernan, and then when I read Ms. Nelsons Unlawful, again I fell in love, only this time with Bruic.  As if this isn't bad enough, now I am totally in love with Conner.  Ms. Nelson's characters are that strong.  They don't give you a chance; you fall head over heels in love with them whether you want to or not.<br />This is not only true of the heroes of Ms. Nelson's books, but also of her heroines.  They are strong women.  Women who don't rely on their beauty.  Women of strong character with personalities of their own.  Women who compliment the men in their lives.<br />SARATOGA SUMMER is a lot more though.  It is so rich in it's description of a true historical time in America's history that you feel as if you are actually living it.  A time in history that perhaps we should not be so proud of, and yet a time that we all should not forget.<br />Ms. Nelson takes you on a sightseeing adventure through the streets of New York City that can only be described as very frightening, and heartbreaking.  She puts you into the mind and thoughts of two newly arrived immigrants from the green countryside of Ireland.  Thoughts that are in awe of what they see, hear, and smell.  She brings you into their minds as they try to find their way through the throngs of people and try to understand why many of the people who came from their own country, act and behave as they do.<br />SARATOGA SUMMER begins in Ireland, in the summer of 1843.  Life is beautiful. The Brennan family is happy working the horses on the O'Malley estate.  Then something horrible happens.  Annie Brennan is knocked off a fence by one of the stallions that becomes spooked.  Both she and her unborn baby are killed, leaving two terrified, and heartbroken little girls, and a devastated husband.  The owner of the estate, Finn O'Malley wants Bowes Brennan and his two girls to remain at the estate with his four sons, and himself, but Bowes thinks it is better for he and the girls to leave, and perhaps after a while go to America.  Finn tells Bowes that if at any time they want to come back, or if there is anything that he can do for them, all they have to do is let him know.<br />Twenty years later Finn receives a note from America.  He calls his four sons to him to discuss the note, which later results in the oldest son, Connor taking a woman he has never met in marriage, by proxy.  Soon afterwards he and his younger brother, Eagan head for America to meet his young bride, Sinead, and her young son, Robbie.<br />What awaits the O'Malley brothers is anything but what they were expecting, and certainly enough to make Connor think twice about staying in America.  But Sinead is determined to stay in New York City.  She doesn't care if Connor goes back to Ireland or not.  She is only concerned about Robbie.  As they run for their very lives.............<br />If you never read a historical romance again in your life, you have to read SARATOGA SUMMER.  It will absolutely astound you.  I cannot put into words the power Ms. Nelson puts into her characters and scenes.  Power that will absolutely take your breath away.<br />I learned things about that summer of 1863 that I never knew existed.  Things that were both exciting as well as terrifying.  Things that I never would have known if I hadn't read SARATOGA SUMMER.  And all of those things that I learned were all wrapped up in the most exciting and wonderful story a person could ever ask for.<br />Ms. Nelson is a three-time winner with her wonderful books.  And SARATOGA SUMMERwins the Triple Crown.<br />My only question is when will there be more.......and how can she possibly top SARATOGA SUMMER!R wins the Triple Crown.  <br />My only question is when will there be more.......and how can she possibly top SARATOGA SUMMER!	2003-01-24
US	50436109	R1R337OYLLAAXE	0595258425	653555257	Postmortem	Books	4	4	4	N	N	POSTMORTEM	Will Henderson has lived a solitary life, working for the San Francisco Post Office for over twenty-five<br />  years. He rides around San Francisco on his rusty old-ten speed, listening to his Walkman, and lives<br />  alone with his little dog, Bingo, in a tiny one-room studio apartment south of Market. Will is very, very<br />  shy and rarely even talks to anyone, except Bingo. On his mail route he very rarely even<br />  acknowledges any of his customers, except the obligatory \\"Hi\\" when called upon. However<br />  there is one old lady who Will has become quite close to in a mother/son type of way. Emily<br />  Everington is everything that Will wished his mother had been, that is if he had known his mother. But<br />  even before his parents were killed in an automobile accident, they were emotionally detached from<br />  him. His mother, being a very strict Catholic did do one thing though, she instilled plenty of guilt and<br />  strict moral codes, into her son. So strict in fact that Will has no friends, or fun in his life. His only<br />  \\"fun\\" is his job, a job he absolutely loves. His only friends being Bingo, and Mrs.<br />  Everington. Mrs. Everington is a very wealthy lady, and enjoys being with Will. They go to baseball<br />  games together, and just sit and talk sometimes. Mrs. Everington would sometimes have Will do<br />  different little chores for her that she wasn't able to do anymore. And Will enjoyed doing them for her.<br />  There is one postal worker in the office that Will does have his eye on, Roxie LaRue. A fifty-some<br />  bleached blonde Dolly Parton look-alike. Roxie has a garbage mouth that would make a longshoreman<br />  blush, but there is something about her that just makes Will melt every time he comes in contact with<br />  her, if only to look. Roxie and Will both led similar lives, in that they both grew up without family<br />  support and emotional contact. Roxie having survived living from one foster home to the next, while<br />  growing up. Roxie had been transferred to the same postal station where Will works because she had<br />  a problem. She was constantly jumping from bed to bed, with any man that she came in contact with,<br />  including her working cohorts. But Will is smitten, although he knows it will go nowhere. On a very hot<br />  day in July, Will is delivering his mail as usual, when he comes to Mrs. Everington's home. As Will is<br />  about to deliver her mail, Mrs. Everington gives him an envelope to post. One that seems very<br />  important to her. She seems afraid, and tells Will that someone is out to kill her. Will passed this off<br />  as one of the old lady's delusions, however the thought doesn't completely leave his mind. That next<br />  day Will wakes to the news that Mrs. Everington is dead. The news reports say that she jumped off<br />  the Golden Gate bridge, however Will knows that this is not possible. Soon after the reports of Mrs.<br />  Everington's death, Will receives a phone call from an attorney, Stephan Martinelli. Mr. Martinelli tells<br />  Will that he has become the sole beneficiary in Mrs. Everington's will. She has left him fifteen million<br />  dollars! Will doesn't quite know how to handle this, or why she would leave him her entire estate.<br />  When Will returns to home after seeing the attorney, he finds Roxie on his doorstep. She tells him<br />  that she had just come by to see how he was, and then one thing leads to another and they find<br />  themselves in bed together. When Will announces his new \\"friendship\\" at work the guys<br />  tease him, telling him that what Will has found, most of the males in San Francisco have already<br />  found with Roxie. But that doesn't stop Will from going out with Roxie again, and after a night of<br />  drinking, which Will has never done, and going to bars, again which Will has never done, Will finds<br />  himself getting married to Roxie the next day. Before he knows it Will is mixed up in murder,<br />  seduction, betrayal and a life that he never would have even dreamed of becoming a part of, much less<br />  a player in before. POSTMORTEM is an exciting story of good versus evil, and what can happen to an<br />  innocent, shy, and very naive person who never ventured from the sheltered existence he has built up<br />  around him. A story of a man who gets pulled into a life he has no control over, nor wants any part of.<br />  Where even the \\"good guys\\" are out to get him. Ms. Bailey has written a very good story,<br />  however the conversations did get rather confusing at times, especially in the beginning. But the story<br />  is strong, and it does keep your attention throughout the book. The characters are multifaceted and<br />  the scenery is very real, if you know anything about San Francisco at all, all will ring very true. There<br />  are some very poignant scenes, and the ending is very, very surprising. I do think you would like<br />  POSTMORTEM and do recommend it to you as a good read.his doorstep.

There is a killer on the loose and you had better hope that you have nothing in your past that may lead him your way.  No matter what appearance you may present, he knows what is beneath that FACADE.<br />To wander down the streets of Pine Knot, Kentucky you would think it was another quaint little southern town.  The people seem to live their lives much the same as any other small town.  But beneath the FAÇADE, lives another world.  A world of, secrets, lies, deception, and horror.<br />Deputy Detective KC Tanner is perfectly happy living his life as a confirmed bachelor.  He is content living alone in his house with his Doberman, Zappa, and doing his job as a detective with the Sheriffs Department of McCreary County.<br />All of this, however, is being threatened by the sheriff's daughter, Sharalee MacArthur, who is determined to live out her childhood fantasy of her love for him.  KC is doing everything he can possibly do to thwart Shar's advances, but it is getting more and more difficult as she is no longer the little girl he remembers.  She came home from college a beautiful young woman.  A young woman who will not leave him alone, although the age difference is too great in KC's mind.  Not to mention that KC's best, and only friend, is Shar's father, Sheriff Mike MacArthur, known to all as Mac.<br />People are being murdered in the most horrendous ways.  Ways that could possibly only mean revenge.  But revenge for what?  There has to be a common denominator that links these people together, and KC is determined to find out what that common denominator is.<br />At the same time KC has to convince Shar that he is not the man for her.  He even takes to talking to the local minister of the church, Pastor Thomas Jackson about Shar, his physical attraction to her, and his past life, including the secret that he has kept.  But it seems that no matter what KC does, Shar will just not give up.  Finally he manages to drive her into the arms of another man, Sidney Kurtz.  Very much to KC's surprise, seeing them together bothers him a lot.<br />However, KC doesn't have time to reflect on his unhappiness with Shar and Sidney being together, he has to solve the murders that are happening, and he has to do it soon before another one happens.<br />What is behind these murders?  The common link seems to be Mac's dead wife, Alison Mac Arthur, Shar's mother.  But who and what is the reason for this?  Alison has been dead for almost twenty years.  What is the secret that seems to be eluding KC?  And who is behind all of this?  He has to find out soon.<br />Ms. Rasey certainly has come up with a winner in FAÇADE.  I could not put this book down.  It had me completely absorbed until the last shocking pages.  I had to find out what was going to happen in both the personal lives of the characters, as well as who was going to be killed next, and why.  FAÇADE is completely addictive from the first page.<br />Ms. Rasey has created multi-faceted characters, and at the same time she has created a<br />super fast moving plot.  She has captured the world of lies, deceit, intrigue, and revenge.  FAÇADE is definitely a must read for its chilling account of the murders, the investigation, and the secrets that caused them.  At the same time bringing into this horrific, and terrifying world love, friendship, and trust.  It is amazing how she has managed to have two opposite plots run concurrently and mixed together to bring about a story that completely hypnotizes the reader.<br />FAÇADE is not only a spine-tingling murder mystery that will leave feeling cold to the bones, it is also a love story that will leave you completely breathless.  FACADE is a wonderful example of Ms. Rasey's talent to blend spine tingling terror and suspense, with warm and sexy romance and love.<br />FACADEwill keep you guessing.  Even if you are clever enough to figure out who did it, which I don't think you will, you still won't believe the dynamite ending.  It will leave you completely  emotionally drained.<br />FAÇADE most definitely proves the old adage: What goes around comes around.  And in this case when it comes around, it is deadly.<br />I definitely recommend that you get a copy of FAÇADE, take it home and lock the doors, turn up the lights, and settle in for a full night of terrific suspense, murder, and love.  All mixed up in a great story that will leave you completely satisfied that you have visited the world of FAÇADE.  You cannot miss with this wonderful book.br />FACADE will keep you guessing.

The story is fast-paced and has a plot that twists and turns just like the snow covered mountain roads of the Catskill Mountains where it takes place.  I don't think it would be classified as a cozy, but it sure has that feel to it.  A story that you find yourself lost in the minute you start reading, and can't take your eyes from until you read those last words.<br />ENCORE TO MURDER opens just like it says.  Right smack dab in the middle of the murder of a beautiful ex-model.  Not just a run of the mill ex-model, but an ex-super model.<br />Veronica Loring lay in front of the fireplace just as beautiful in death as she was in life.  The killer now has to figure out how to get out of there and leave no clues.  Methodically the killer scans the whole house and makes sure everything is in place.  Finally deciding on a way to make Veronica's death appear as an accident, the murderer goes about placing Veronica's body, perfectly, in her own car, and making it appear to be a road accident.  It would have worked, except....................<br />Ed McAvoy is a former Detroit homicide captain who has been put on medical retirement because of a drug dealers lucky shot that hit him in the leg.  Although he still sports a slight limp, and some pain during cold, wet weather, he feels he is much too young to be sitting around in a rocking chair, and is now the Police Chief of Peekamoose Heights, in New York.  Peekamoose is a small community in the Catskills Mountains, where everyone knows everyone.  Just the quiet little place a guy can still do what he does best and not have to fight major crime everyday.<br />Ed soon finds that no matter what size the community is he still will have to call upon his skills in order to figure out just what has happened to Veronica Loring.  There are a<br />multitude of suspects, and in order to find out just which one did this, he has decided upon an idea that might just flush out the killer.  However he needs help from the mayor, the doctor in charge, as well as Veronica's very best friend Jennifer.  Together they just might solve the case.<br />ENCORE TO MURDER is a story full of mystery, suspense, and with a cast of characters that keep the story moving fast.  Through the characters you get to know the victim and learn about her flaws as well as her many wonderful characteristics.  Even in death, Mr. Stackhouse, brings her alive.<br />I also particularly liked the way Mr. Stackhouse brought the killers thoughts into the story.  Without giving away a clue as to \\"who done it\\" he put the killer right into the scenes and let you read his/her thoughts concerning what was going on at that moment.  It not only allowed you to see where the killer was going at that time, but also gave you chills just knowing that he/she was right there in the same scene as his/her victims.<br />ENCORE TO MURDER is a cozy mystery that I thoroughly enjoyed.  I am really looking forward to more from Mr. Stackhouse.  His Ed McAvoy series is a hit and will go on as long as Mr. Stackhouse allows it to, which I hope is for a very long time.  I recommend that you go out and purchase ENCORE TO MURDER, get comfortable in a cozy chair, and just sit back and enjoy.  It certainly is a wonderful way to spend a cold and blustery winter night.has decided upon an idea that might just flush out the killer.

It goes on to say, that Disney is actually in cryonic suspension, awaiting a cure for the cancer that took his life.  When that cure is found he will be treated, cured, and brought back to life.<br />It's actually not such an outlandish idea considering that there are quite a few other bodies now awaiting the same outcome.  Whether you believe that this can happen, or not, just think about the repercussions of what could happen if someday this all could be not just a dream but reality.  Stranger things have already happened.<br />\\"A dream is a wish your heart makes, when you're fast asleep\\"*<br />December 1966, Arthur Nolan is a young oncology resident who would much rather be an artist than a physician.  But instead of following his dream, he is following the dream of his physician father.<br />Then one night everything changes.  Arthur is transferred to the PM shift, just as an older gentleman is admitted to Arthur's service.  The older man is Walt Disney.  The PM shift being slow, as most of them are, allows Arthur and Walt to became friends as they talk the nights away.  Soon Walt offers to make Arthur's dreams of becoming an artist, come true, if he will help him make his own dream come true.  He offers Arthur enough money to enable him to just walk away from medicine and pursue his dream of becoming an artist.  All Arthur has to do is make sure that Walt is not buried, cremated or anything else after his death.  Instead he is to make sure that his body will go into cryonic suspension until there is a cure for his lung cancer, and then he will be brought back to life.<br />Arthur agrees to the idea and becomes a member of The Circle.  The Circle is a small group of very trusted men who will make sure that Walt Disney's frozen body is not disturbed, and when it is time, and there is a cure, his cancer will be cured and he will be brought back to life.  A doctor, a lawyer, a banker, etc; all are men who have the expertise to pull this off.<br />When the time comes, each member of the of The Circle, using his own expertise, and acting under the prior direction and orders of Walt Disney spirit him off to be cryonically frozen and to wait until there is a medication that will cure his cancer.  The world, and Walt's family, in the meantime think that he has been cremated and inurned at Forest Lawn Cemetery.  The Circle go off to live their lives, protecting the secret, waiting for the time to come when a new drug will be discovered to cure their boss, and allow him to rise from the dead.<br />Years pass, the men of The Circle are aging, and there is a takeover plan of the Disney Corporation in the works.  Arnold Garth and others want to split the Disney Company up.  The breakup could create a lot of millionaires, but of course would destroy everything that Walt Disney had created.  The Circle can no longer wait for the right time to come, they have to wake Walt now to stop the breakup of the company.  He is the only one who can save it.<br />There is a new drug being tested and so they decide that they will get this drug, use it, and hopefully it will be the cure.  They will then be able to wake Walt before it is too late.  However something goes deadly wrong when Arthur tries to steal the drug, only to end up having a stroke that kills him in the process.<br />Due to their advancing ages, each member of The Circle has appointed a replacement in case the need arises.  Arthur has appointed his nephew, Harry Poole to take his place in The Circle.  Harry has no idea what in the world is going on.  All he sees are a bunch of old men who have this crazy idea.  But after listening to them, it doesn't sound so crazy after all, and so he decides to go along with the program.<br />But things are not to go quite the way that was intended.  The secret gets out, and people are trying to stop the plans to bring Waltback.  Keeping Walt alive isn't as easy as was first thought.<br />WAKING WALT is a masterfully written work of fiction based on an urban legend that has been around for years.  Mr. Pontius has taken the legend and built a story that is completely fascinating.  The imagination used to create WAKING WALT is absolutely brilliant, and the writing is flawless.<br />Mr. Pontius has managed to take something that most of us have heard and written off as ridiculous and built it into a fascinating mystery/thriller that is not only intriguing, but also quite plausible.<br />You come away from WAKING WALT with the feeling that maybe this could really have happened.<br />WAKING WALT may be a work of fiction, but is the idea?  I wonder, and I very highly recommend that you read it and make up your own mind.  You will not be sorry, WAKING WALT is wonderful, and makes you think.  Larry Pontius has penned a winner, and well worth the read.  One that you will not want to miss.<br />In my opinion Mr. Pontius has a brilliant future ahead of him.  One that I definitely will follow.<br />*From Walt Disney's Cinderellaans to bring Walt back.  Keeping Walt alive isn't as easy as was first thought.<br />WAKING WALT is a masterfully written work of fiction based on an urban legend that has been around for years.  Mr. Pontius has taken the legend and built a story that is completely fascinating.  The imagination used to create WAKING WALT is absolutely brilliant, and the writing is flawless.<br />Mr. Pontius has managed to take something that most of us have heard and written off as ridiculous and built it into a fascinating mystery/thriller that is not only intriguing, but also quite plausible.<br />You come away from WAKING WALT with the feeling that maybe this could really have happened.  <br />WAKING WALT may be a work of fiction, but is the idea?  I wonder, and I very highly recommend that you read it and make up your own mind.  You will not be sorry, WAKING WALT is wonderful, and makes you think.  Larry Pontius has penned a winner, and well worth the read.  One that you will not want to miss.<br />In my opinion Mr. Pontius has a brilliant future ahead of him.  One that I definitely will follow.<br />*From Walt Disney's Cinderella	2002-12-21
US	50436109	R1QCE5TE37A8OE	1892343266	224720426	The Dark Side	Books	5	7	8	N	N	THE DARK SIDE	Carrie Sanders was supposed to spend the night with one of her girlfriends on Halloween night.  But the fifteen year old never made it to her friend's house, which was only about a mile down the road from where she lived in Lake Point, Wisconsin.  No one saw her after she went out of the door of her home that night, except a Greyhound bus employee, who said he sold her a one-way ticket to Los Angeles.<br />After a long search by the police, the neighbors, and her parents revealed no trace of her, her father, Raymond Sanders, hired a local private detective to try and trace Carrie down.  But all Philip Jenkins found was a bullet to the back of his head, thus ending his search.  This wasn't going to stop Raymond as he knew his daughter was out there somewhere, and he was going to find her, and so three weeks after Carrie became missing, he hired Jack Murphy, private detective, to continue the search for her.<br />Jack had never handled a missing person's case before.  After going through a particularly heart wrenching divorce he had left his home in Lake Point, and relocated to Los Angeles.  There he opened Mid-City Confidential Investigations, and mainly took on dead-beat dads, insurance claims, and cheating spouse cases.  But due to a referral from a friend of Jacks, Mr. Sanders wanted Jack to investigate and find his little girl.<br />Before he could start his search for Carrie, he had to repay a debt that he owed.  Arturo, while robbing a liquor store, had saved Jack's life when he got caught innocently in the middle of it.  In doing so, Arturo had been captured and sent to prison.  Jack wanted to pay back the debt by helping Arturo reenter society.  And so after picking Arturo up at the prison, when he was released, Jack took him back to his apartment and gave him a job with the agency.<br />What follows is a ride onto itself.  THE DARK SIDE takes you on the trail of the rich, the not so rich, the famous, and the not so famous, and into the dark and seamy side of child porn.  The story is full of the dark and dangerous side of Los Angeles, but even when you are in gang territory and feeling very uncomfortable as to what could happen, you are also laughing at some of the comments and antics of Jack and his sidekick Arturo.<br />I loved THE DARK SIDE.  It was full of tears, terror, laughs, comedy, and above all it kept me glued to the pages.  Mr. Sherman is a natural.  THE DARK SIDE reads like a Raymond Chandler mystery, but with it's own special flavor.  THE DARK SIDE is the first in Mr. Sherman's Jack Murphy books, and what a first it is.  I just cannot wait for the next one to come out.  Mr. Sherman has introduced some of the most intriguing and complex, characters to come along in a long time.  And I want to get to know each and everyone of them better.  There is of course Jack Murphy himself.  A man who has had a bad experience with women, and is fighting his own demons to over come the result.  Then there is Arturo, a hard core ex con, gangbanger who has a heart of gold, and with whom you cannot help but love.  But don't let him know that, and don't cross him.  Then there is Nadia.  In love with Jack, but can she overcome the old wounds that he has, in order to capture his heart?<br />There are many, many more exciting and wonderful characters in THE DARK SIDE who will have you laughing, screaming, and crying through out the book.  You will absolutely be disgusted by some, feel badly for others, and hate even more of them, but you won't be sorry you met them.  Mr. Sherman has brought to life the city of Los Angeles in a very, true to life way, and uncovered some of the parts of it that most people would never know about because they wouldn't dare venture into it.<br />I recommend that if you like the private eye versus the bad guy type of novel, you have to get a copy of THE DARK SIDE immediately.  This book is going to sell fast, so hurry before they are all gone, otherwise you will miss one of the best books you willread in a very long time.  Mr. Sherman is on his way to the top of the charts, and believe me you will want to follow right along with him.<br />ALL ABOUT MURDER REVIEWSks you will read in a very long time.

They aren't your garden-variety high society women, but they aren't exactly the dregs of society either.  It's up to Homicide Detective LeAnne McVeigh to find out who is brutally torturing and killing these women before another one is found dead.  She needs to find a common link that these women share, and find it fast.<br />LeAnne's first suspect, Marcus Gallego, also known as Snake, has an alibi that completely exonerates him in the killing of the first victim, who just also happened to be his wife, Jillian.<br />The death of Jillian absolutely devastates Snake.  It also introduces Snake into LeAnne's comfortable and quiet world.  LeAnne is engaged to the Henry County prosecutor, Chad Baker.  She feels that she has finally found the one thing that has always been lacking in her life, a quiet, sedate, comfortable, and safe existence.  And this is the life she would finally have as Chad's wife.  However she is completely torn asunder when she realizes she has a tremendous attraction for Snake.  Snake cannot possibly offer her the stability and security that Chad has offered her.  Nevertheless she cannot seem to control her overwhelming attraction to this ill-mannered, unpredictable, and uninhibited biker.  LeAnne's life has been completely turned upside down.  She can't keep her mind on her work or anything but Snake.  She has to get herself under control.  Otherwise she is going to lose everything; Chad, her job, catching the murderer, even her sanity.<br />The first thing that LeAnne has to do is to find out who is killing the women of Henry County, and she has to do it fast.  The time between killings is growing closer.  More women are being killed, and it doesn't look like anyone is any closer to finding out who the killer is, although there are plenty of suspects, including Snake who has not been completely deemed innocent, according to LeAnne's fianc&eacute;, Chad.<br />KISS OF DECEIT has just about everything that a reader could want in a book.  It has suspense, thrills, mystery, intrigue, murder, and sensual/sexual moments.  The characters are multi faceted.  They bring excitement, intrigue, and life to an already fascinating story.  They feel real with all the warts and faults that true humans possess, and the reader feels them all.<br />There are several suspects, and Ms Rasey gives just enough hints along the way that you know it could be any of them, and still you cannot figure out which one.  Just when you think you have the answers, another suspect comes onto the scene to make you rethink your position.<br />KISS OF DECEIT reads smoothly, and is very fast paced.  You will not want to put this book down to even eat.  Ms. Rasey keeps the story moving, and just when you think it has slowed down enough to take a break you are caught up once again.  Before you know it time has passed, and you are on the last pages of the book and totally surprised and overtaken with it's ending.<br />I completely recommend  KISS OF DECEIT to everyone.  Anyone who loves a fast paced, absorbing thriller with a lot of mystery and intrigue is going to absolutely love  KISS OF DECEIT.  And those of you who like some sensual sexual tension mixed in are going to be doubly blessed.<br />KISS OF DECEIT is not just another tale of suspicion, murder, and intrigue.  It is so much more.  And Ms. Rasey is definitely the newest queen of suspense and thrills.<br />I advise everyone to get their copy of  KISS OF DECEIT, as these books are not going to remain on the shelves long.

Not only another fantastic novel, but one with old friends, and even some new ones.  Reading BLOOD ON THE TONGUE felt like coming home again.<br />It is in the middle of the coldest part of the year in the Peak District.  The time of the year for cold, frozen feet and red, burning ears.  When snow flurries blow hard, and the snow banks along the roads grow so high that they hide all kinds of secrets.  Perhaps even a dead body, or two.<br />Ben Cooper and Diane Fry find themselves together again, at the Edendale Police Department in the midst of a crime wave.  Young men are beating each other, people are being found frozen in the snow, and there is a terrible shortage of help.  To make life just that much more unbearable at the moment, Diane has a new nemesis, DC Gavin Murfin.  A completely, in Diane's mind anyway, uncivilized brute who drives her nuts with both his disgusting eating habits, as well as just him simply breathing.  Everything about Gavin disgusts Diane.<br />To top everything off E Division is getting a new Detective Chief Inspector.  Stewart Tailby is retiring to a desk job at headquarters, and DCI Oliver Kessen is taking over.<br />In the middle of this chaos a young woman arrives from Canada in search of information concerning her grandfather, Daniel McTeague.  The problem with this is that Pilot Officer McTeague has been missing since his RAF plane went down 57 years earlier in the peat moors around Irontongue Hill.  It was reported at the time that Officer McTeague had survived the accident, and had left the wreckage, walking away from his military career and past life, never to be seen, or heard from again.  His granddaughter, Alison Morrissey does not believe this, and is insistent that the police open the old case again and investigate.<br />Because of political pressure, the Chief Superintendent agrees to speak to Morrissy concerning her grandfather, but doesn't really have his heart in the whole thing.  After all the disappearance was 57 years ago, and all of the evidence surrounding it seems pretty sound.<br />But Ben cannot, and will not let it alone.  He has to find out what happened almost 60 years ago.<br />BLOOD ON THE TONGUE, like the previous books by Mr. Booth, is full of atmosphere and personal relationships.  He does this in such a way that you actually feel that you are in the story.  The way Mr. Booth describes the Peak District landscape, and the people of<br />Edendale draw you into the story.<br />You feel the cold wind against your face, burning your ears, and making it difficult to breath.  As you look up at Irontongue Hill you will see it is, \\"tongue shaped with ridges and furrows.  Reptilian, not human, with a curl at the tip.  Colder and harder than iron.  Darker rock laying on broken teeth of volcano rock debris.\\"  And 'you will' see it.  All of this you will see and feel, along with people who you cannot forget, their lives entwined and yet separate.  Mr. Booth brings both the land and the people together into a story that is completely unforgettable.  One that will haunt you and make you want for more.  And when you finally get that next story, Mr. Booth does it again, leaving you satisfied, and yet already yearning for more.<br />BLOOD ON THE TONGUE weaves the past and the present into one.  Brings the story full circle.  Every character and scene is woven so tightly that you cannot separate them, and yet they remain individual.  The characters are everyday characters with lives, feelings, and personalities of their own that you actually can feel and touch.  The scenes are so real that they will haunt your dreams at night.  The mood, while dark, is absolutely balanced with enough humor and light that it doesn't depress you, but instead keeps you turning those pages to learn more.<br />BLOOD ON THE TONGUE is an absolute winner, and Mr. Booth has proven himself again as a literary giant.  All I can say is that BLOOD ON THE TONGUE will leave you craving for more from this outstanding author.<br />As with Mr. Booth's previous books, Black Dog, and Dancing with the Virgins, BLOOD ON THE TONGUE is a book that you will want to read slowly, because you want to savor each and every word.  It is a book you will not want to rush through.  I took my time, knowing that when I turned that last page I would want the next episode and didn't want to have to wait for a long time.  Now that I have turned that last page, I am looking forward to the next book out of Mr. Booth, knowing that he again will outdo himself, just as he has with BLOOD ON THE TONGUE.  Until then my dreams will be full of the sights, the sounds, and the smells of the Peak District and the people who inhabit it.at BLOOD ON THE TONGUE will leave you craving for more from this outstanding author.  <br />As with Mr. Booth's previous books, Black Dog, and Dancing with the Virgins, BLOOD ON THE TONGUE is a book that you will want to read slowly, because you want to savor each and every word.

By chapter two there was no turning back, I had to keep reading until I finished the entire book.  Mr. Archer takes you out of that comfortable chair, in which you are sitting, and plunks you right smack dab in the middle of San Francisco, and into the life of Doug McCool.  Once there, there is no way out, except to stay on that ride until it is over.  But that is ok, because you won't want to get off this roller coaster.  In fact I liked the first ride so much, I am ready for another.<br />The life of a process server may be dull.  That is if your name isn't Doug McCool.  His life is everything but dull.<br />It is 1973, and Doug lives mostly in his modified VW Microbus, and works as a process server in San Francisco for AAA Legal Process Service.  Most of the time the work is dull, and routine.  But that suits Doug pretty well.  He hasn't quite decided what he wants to do with his life, after Viet Nam, and this job leaves him plenty of time to party and enjoy the life that San Francisco holds for a single, good looking, young man.  But every once in a while one of the clients make life a little difficult by ducking service, and Doug has to chase them down.  Such was the case when he was asked to serve James Gunter for the Iranian government.  All of a sudden Doug's life was anything but dull and routine.<br />What started out as a routine service of court papers, soon turns into murder, chases, gunfights, fast cars, drugs, international intrigue, elegant boats, loose women, and big money.  Add to all of this a big time, high profile attorney and you have all the ingredients for a book you will not be able to put down.  A fast paced, often humorous, hard boiled mystery, so very well written you breeze through the pages before you even realize it.<br />TOO MANY SPIES SPOIL THE CASE is written with such passion.

Everyone from Doug's gay ex-army buddy Rick, and Jerome an old man who befriends, and wants to help Doug, to Barbara, his gal Friday and bed partner. Even Farrar, one of the Iranian secret agents becomes real, and even human.

I don't think that the dictionary has enough of these words to describe Ms. LaPierre's Hawkman series.  Each and every one of them, from THE ENEMY STALKS up to and including DIRTY DIAMONDS just gets better and better.  How is that possible?  Especially when they started out even more terrific than you can imagine.  But they do, and DIRTY DIAMONDS just proves that.<br />Every time I open a new Hawkman book, I fall in love with Tom Casey all over again.  Tom is known as Hawkman in the beautiful countryside of Oregon where he lives with his wife Jennifer and his falcon, Pretty Girl.  Having retired from \\"the agency\\" he now keeps busy as a private investigator with offices over a doughnut shop in Medford.<br />This time Hawkman gets himself involved with a very mixed up, dubious young woman, Jamey Schyler, who has shown up in Medford asking Hawkman to protect her.  When Hawkman starts asking questions of her, she freaks out and changes her mind.  Soon however it becomes quite evident that something is going on, as her home is broken into, and her kitten almost killed.  Still though, she will not come clean with Hawkman, and therefore he becomes very intrigued as to just what in the world is going on with her.<br />It soon becomes evident that whatever Jamey is involved in, it isn't legal.  It is also very dangerous as her ex-boyfriend, Carl Hopkins, who is out to find her, and whatever it is she is hiding.  Hawkman is sure that he is not getting the truth out of Jamey, but at the same time feels that if he doesn't keep an eye on her, she is going to end up hurt, or worse yet dead, if Carl does manage to find her.<br />DIRTY DIAMONDS overflows with action, danger, deceit and a plot that moves so fast that you cannot put it down until you come to that last page.  Time fly's as you are reading DIRTY DIAMONDS.  You are so engrossed in the story, that you don't even realize it until you read the last sentence and look up and realize the rest of the world has flown by while you were in the world of Hawkman, as he tried to solve yet another puzzle.<br />Like all of her previous books, Ms. LaPierre has penned another masterpiece.  I cannot put into words how absolutely fantastic DIRTY DIAMONDS is.  The story is believable, and the characters are very real, with qualities you cannot help but like.  You even have to like Jamey, even if she is not quite on the up and up.  And then of course there is Hawkman.  He is such a wonderful character that you feel like he is a friend.  He and Jennifer make a wonderful couple, and you just fall in love with them.  They both have personalities that just jump from the pages and grab you.  Very real personalities.<br />I sincerely hope that you get a copy of DIRTY DIAMONDS and find a comfortable place to sit back and relax, because you are not going to believe how caught up in the world of Hawkman you are going to become.  As with the previous Hawkman books, Ms. LaPierre has outdone herself again.  And I just cannot wait to see what she does with this cast of characters next time.

Mr. Miller is a very, very talented author.  And he continues to prove it with this second book.  Don't miss the chance to see Mr. Miller's star rise on the horizon in the literary world, because it is on its way and moving fast.  I know I definitely will be there.  I hope you will be too.	2002-09-21

Out there on the streets, standing on the corners, in the all night coffee shops.  You can find them in just about any city, large, or small.  It's a culture that most of us avoid.  But not Michael Buzzelli.  He sought them out.<br />Michael works Monday through Friday at the Rochester City Chronicle typing out obituaries and doing leg work for the journalists.  He wants to become a crime reporter, and figures the only way to do so would be to write a story that no one else could possibly get.<br />There is a killer out there on the streets.  Someone who has killed a prostitute.  He not only killed her, but he killed her in a most horrendous way, leaving her mutilated body behind.  The police have no clue as to who this person is.  Only that he is brutal and sadistic, and that he has to be found.<br />Michael needs money to make ends meet.  He also figures that if he can get a job at Jacks, he might be able to pick up some clues as to who killed the prostitute.  A story like that would get him out of obituaries, and onto the crime desk where he wanted to be.  And so Michael applies for a job, and gets the midnight till dawn shift.<br />His first night on the job, Michael meets some very interesting individuals.  There is Fatso, a retired postal worker, who is alone, and lonely.  Fatso comes into Jacks every night, and knows everything about everyone.  He takes an instant liking to Michael and clues him in on the people that frequent Jacks, much to the chagrin of Marcus.  Marcus comes into Jacks and just sits, says nothing, reads his paper, and watches.  He doesn't like others to know who, or what he is.  There is rumor he was linked to the mob, but no one really knows the truth.<br />Then there is Speed.  Now there is a character for you.  He is a petty thief, or as Fatso says, in the merchandise business.  Speed seems to live his life in constant high gear, thus his name.  He never slows down, and is always on the lookout for that next deal.<br />Then there are the girls.  Every night they work the street in front of Jacks.  Venus, a young black girl who loved to make Michael uncomfortable at their first and only meeting, Sandy a young woman who seems to have more common sense than beauty, and then there is Felicia.  Felicia is a burgundy-red haired girl, with the largest gray-blue eyes that Michael has ever seen.  It wasn't love at first sight, but it sure is heading that way.<br />Soon after Michael starts working at Jacks, Venus comes up missing.  She is later found dead.  Mutilated like the first hooker, and Michael was the last to see her alive.  After finally convincing the two detectives on the case that he had nothing to do with it, Michael thinks that perhaps a story about the people that hang around Jacks would be more interesting than a story on the prostitute killer.  If he happens to find the killer, and gets a story about that along with the other story, more power to him.<br />JOHNNY BLADE is a fantastic serial killer novel. But it is much more than that.  Although Mr. Tomasso keeps you on the edge of your seat from the first page on with the story of Johnny The Blade and his sadistic, insane motives, and actions, the background story concerning the people of Jack's Place is just as interesting.  The characters grab  you and won't let go.  They become real, living, breathing people with emotions, dislikes and likes of their own.  Even the police detectives become familiar friends.  In fact I would like to see more of Detectives Cocuzzi and Cage.<br />Mr. Tomasso has managed to incorporate two winning stories in one book without any gap between.  A story of a horrific, insane, killer, and a story of some misunderstood, caring, feeling people who live lives in a culture that most of society looks down upon.  I am not sure which story I liked better in JOHNNY BLADE.  While reading about the insane, alcoholic, sadistic killer I was completelyglued to the pages.  But when the story slid into the lives of the patrons of Jacks, or into the lives of the detectives, I became completely immersed in that part of the story.<br />I found myself looking forward to Michael's nights when he was on duty at Jacks.  I wanted to find out what happened to Speed, where did Marcus go, are the girls all right.  Each one had their own story, and quality that had wormed their way into my heart. I had to find out what was going on with them.  JOHNNY BLADE keeps your attention, and your emotions completely hostage until that last page.<br />JOHNNY BLADE is a winner, and I hope that this will be just the beginning of a long relationship with some of the characters that Mr. Tomasso has brought to life.  I certainly recommend that you read JOHNNY BLADE.  It is absolutely fantastic, and I know that this group of characters will find a home in you heart and mind, as they have mine.completely glued to the pages.

A good job, a nice home, a beautiful wife, a wonderful daughter, a lot of friends, and a Ford Contour that he loved to drive on the narrow winding California highways at top speed.<br />Josh Michaels also had everything that he didn't want.  He had an ex-lover who was blackmailing him, and a deep dark secret in his past that he didn't want his wife, or anyone to ever find out about.  A secret that could land him in prison.  And now it looked like he also may have someone out there that wanted him dead.<br />On his way home from work one afternoon, everything that Josh had that he wanted, and everything that he didn't want, seemed to collide.  A driver in a SUV forced Josh off the road, into the Sacramento River.  In his fight for survival, Josh saw the person who had forced him off the road, standing on the bridge, watching him drown.  He saw the person give a 'thumbs down' sign to him, before he drove away, leaving Josh to save himself.  Josh managed to get himself out of the sinking car, and although he couldn't swim, he managed to get himself to the banks of the river, and saved his life.<br />Josh survived this attempt on his life, but it seems that the police can't or won't even investigate the accident, as they have no clues as to who would do such a thing to Josh.<br />With that in mind Josh returns home to recuperate, and hopefully forget what had happened to him.  No sooner had he gotten home when the phone rings.  On the other end of the phone is another nightmare for Josh.  The sound of Bell's voice sends Josh into a state of complete fear and anxiety.  Josh thought that he had paid her off and gotten rid of her, but here she was again, demanding more money.  He would be paying for having that affair with her forever.  Without any recourse he agreed to meet with Bell for one more payoff, but that would be it.  And with that in mind he agrees to meet her at the zoo.<br />Sitting on a bench in front of one of the tiger enclosures Bell and Josh argue about her blackmailing him, and her wanting to rekindle the romance they once had.  Josh wants no part of it, and he wants her to take the money and leave him alone.  Meanwhile although they don't know it, an indistinguishable looking man is watching them.  He is taking in the whole scene and putting it in the back of his mind to use as information on the habits of Josh.  Every bit of information he can gather will make it much easier to do the job he was hired to do.  Kill Josh Michaels.<br />Accidents keep happening to Josh, one after another.  Bell gets bolder and bolder about telling about the affair and the illegal act that Josh admitted to her during their affair.  People are dying, including friends.  And Josh is being pulled deeper and deeper into the muck.  Soon Josh figures out that these aren't accidents at all, he figures out that it is indeed himself that is the target of someone.  But who?  And why?  And what is he going to do about it?<br />ACCIDENTS WAITING TO HAPPEN is a complex story of what a man is capable of doing when he cannot figure out any other way of saving his child, and what that one incident can lead to in the future.  It is the story of what others are capable of when it comes to saving their jobs, and reputations in the business world.<br />ACCIDENTS WAITING TO HAPPEN is full of twists, turns and even dead ends, but all make perfect sense as you are reading the story.  The story, although very complex, is written in such a way that one can follow without the fear of losing their place in the events as they happen.  The characters bring out many different emotions, fear, anxiety, love, hatred, and sympathy.  You will laugh at some of Bob's ways, cry when Mark is the victim of something that was meant for Josh, become completely overtaken with fear when Margaret answers the phone, want to slap Bell because of her attitude, and even laugh at Wiener when he appears at the front door with ribbonson his ears.  But one person you will not laugh at is James Mitchell.  You will not laugh at him at all!<br />Mr. Wood has written a great book, which flows fast.  You don't realize it until you have come to the surprise ending, that you have been sitting and reading the entire book.  Time stops, and all you are aware of are the words that flow across the pages.<br />I recommend that everyone read ACCIDENTS WAITING TO HAPPEN.

US	50436109	RHAAIFO39D7SG	0595210848	246121541	In His Shadow	Books	5	4	6	N	N	IN HIS SHADOW	IN HIS SHADOW is a very compelling story written by Dave Zeltserman. It is a different, and unusual PI novel.  I have never read one quite like it, and was so completely absorbed in the plot that I completely lost track of time while reading it.<br />Although IN HIS SHADOW is definitely not for the squeamish, or faint of heart, the writing flows, and the characters are so well developed and intriguing, you cannot look away.  The scenes, the plotting, the dialogue, although sometimes very disturbing, are absolutely fascinating and real.<br />IN HIS SHADOW overflows with lies, violence, betrayal, murder, all with a psychological twist.  It is a descent into the darkest levels of human nature, which is just so fascinating that you cannot take your eyes from the pages.<br />In my opinion, IN HIS SHADOW is hardboiled fiction at it's best.<br />Johnny Lane has it all.  He runs a detective agency that is so successful that he can't handle all the business himself.  And so to compensate for this he contracts out some of the cases that just aren't that big, thus keeping the major ones for himself.  He also keeps 60% of the fees that are collected on those he contracts out.  This split isn't exactly that well appreciated by at least one of the PI's that he contracts out to, but Johnny has a way of justifying it to himself that makes perfect sense.  At least to him it does, as does everything that Johnny does.<br />Johnny is also a columnist for the Denver Examiner, where he turns his cases into intriguing articles.  This has made Johnny Lane into quite the celebrity around town.  And Johnny does love his celebrity status.  Not only does he love it, but he also believes it himself.<br />Life is good for Johnny.  Until the day when a young woman walks into his office wanting him to find her birth parents.  When Johnny's approached by Mary Williams he finds himself taking the case on, although she can't even come close to paying his normal fees, because he wants a break from the mundane, and depressing cases that have been crossing his desk lately.  Besides, Mary is a very, very beautiful young woman.  And this case shouldn't be that difficult.<br />Little does Johnny know.  This case could be the end of not only his career as a private detective, but it could also be the end of Johnny.  It isn't long before Johnny's life is completely turned upside down, and if discovered, the truth could destroy his life.  Then it only gets worse.<br />There are so many dramatic twists and turns in the life of Johnny Lane that it would be difficult to keep up with them if it wasn't for the superb writing skills of Mr. Zeltserman.  You follow along without even a hint of confusion, even though this is a very dark, complex story.<br />Mr. Zeltserman shows the dark side of Johnny Lane in such a way that even the most disgusting parts are not only explained, but also in the end understood.  As Johnny's dark side emerges, the distance between reality and fiction grow even further apart in his mind. The past and the present seem to become one entity of it's own, undistinguishable from each other, and all condensed together into one mass.<br />IN HIS SHADOW is full of excitement, intrigue, mystery, and even dark humor.  It is superbly written and absolutely hypnotizes you.  You find yourself on a roller coaster ride that you want to get off of, but you can't.  No matter how terrorized you are you just have to find out what that next hill is going to be like, even if it does kill you.  Thus you are in free fall, free fall into the insanity that also finds Johnny Lane.<br />I recommend this book for anyone who wants to be completely taken over by the terror, mystery, thrills, and superb writing of an excellent author.  Mr. Zeltserman gives you all of that, and much more in this wonderful novel.  IN HIS SHADOW is a winner, in my opinion, and I very much think that will be your opinion also.k from the mundane, and depressing cases that have been crossing his desk lately.

You know the ones, where the author rehashes the things that went on during the war, and all.  Well I read the first couple of pages and before I knew it I was sitting there crying my eyes out.  Then the next thing I knew, I was madder than you could ever believe because some very evil, and evil is the only word that comes close to describing them, characters entered the picture.  The story was no longer set in Vietnam, it was in a small American town near the Canadian border, and the characters that had entered the story were as bad, maybe even worse, than any Viet Cong.  I sat there gritting my teeth, hoping that these guys would get one tenth of what they were handing out, they were so despicable.<br />The author, Robert Furlani, told me that DEAD RECKONING started out slow, and then would pick up speed.  He sure wasn't kidding, however the speed didn't pick up, it was going full bore from page one.  It only got faster.  DEAD RECKONING has everything, suspense, drama, horror, thrills, and believe me a lot of excitement.<br />Jimmy Taggert and Bobby Ryan grew up together.  They literally spent all of their time together from the time they met in the third grade until they went to Vietnam together.  They were on their second tour of duty, and all both wanted to do was go home.  Jimmy was ready to settle down and marry his girlfriend, Anne.  Bobby figured since Jimmy was going to get married, he may as well also marry his girlfriend, Deb, too.  And so they made a pledge.  They would save up their money and put it together, and then split it evenly, to buy their girlfriends rings, and ask them to marry them the minute they got home.  Unfortunately the only one to make it home was Jimmy.<br />After Jimmy got home he married Anne, and over the years became Sheriff of Darien.  Anne worked at the First National Bank as the bank manager. Over the next thirty years they raised their four children, had multiple grandchildren, and had a happy and successful life together.  Now it was time to retire, travel the country and see all the kids, and grandchildren, that had moved to distant parts.<br />Michael Baker has other ideas though.  A psychotic, psychopathic terrorist, he and his gang of sociopaths have an agenda of their own.  Michael isn't your typical criminal.  He is a very well groomed, good-looking, above average intelligent psychopath.  He and his gang of criminals are traveling the country robbing banks, and other facilities to gather money to fund his terrorist operation.  In his quest to gather this money they decide to rob the First National Bank of Darien.  Anne is killed, and Jimmy is devastated.  It becomes Jimmy's life's work to hunt Baker, and his men down and bring justice to Anne.  This job is personal, and gets more personal as Baker moves around, and Jimmy isn't going to let go until it is done, one way or the other.<br />DEAD RECKONING, as well as being a mesmerizing thriller, is also a story of friendship, and love.  It is a story of retribution, and loyalty.  DEAD RECKONING is also a fast paced, very fast paced, thriller that will grab you in the first few pages.  It starts out fast and goes into super drive.  The story is riveting, and cannot be put down until the last page is turned.<br />Mr. Furlani has written a story of terror, intrigue, and suspense, that will both anger you, as well intrigue you.  He has pitted two very strong, and intelligent characters that make you wonder who is going to win in the end.  There is no \\"white hat/black hat known winner\\" here, you just don't know until you get to the end, and the end is both full of action, and surprise twists.<br />Those of you who like James Patterson are in for the ride of your life with DEAD RECKONING.  And those of you who haven't read any James Patterson, can rest assured that Mr. Furlani is taking up where Patterson has left off.  Mr. Furlani is the new king of the terror/suspense genre.  He may be the new guy on the block, but believe me he is here to stay.  And I for one will be right there to purchase his next book.  He has won a fan in me.<br />I sincerely recommend that everyone purchase DEAD RECKONING, you will definitely be more than pleased with what you get.  I only hope that Mr. Furlani has many more stories like DEAD RECKONING to follow, and in some of the books continues to follow up with Jimmy.  He is definitely someone I want to get better acquainted with.  He has become a friend, and someone I want to learn more about.p where Patterson has left off.

He says that he is suffering from amnesia, and has absolutely no memory of how he arrived in Georgia, or why he is even there.

The descriptions of the scenery are so vivid, and real that you can hear the Ell as it thunders overhead, smell the exhaust from the cars, hear the sirens as the police cars scream around the corner to yet another emergency, and smell the urine and body odors that emit from the jail cells.  You actually feel the fear that the characters feel, as they find themselves in terrifying situations.<br />Mr. McGowan sets up a sensational plot full of action.  His characters are so real that the reader has a difficult time remembering that FALSE STATURE is a book of fiction.  He tells a story, one that you can't put down.<br />FALSE STATURE is an absolutely wonderful, dramatic, fast paced book that has been written by a talent who knows how to grab your attention, and doesn't let it go.  I cannot recommend this book too highly.  You have just got to read FALSE STATURE, by Dennis J McGowan.<br />I will repeat what I said at the beginning, \\"move over Joseph Wambaugh, there is a new guy on the block, and he is taking over\\".

She has a daughter in college, and is the publisher of the town's very successful newspaper.  She recently handed over her newspaper duties, for the time being, to see if she still wants to continue doing it.  In the meantime she is delivering the papers herself to get closer to her customers, help her with her depression, and to lose the weight she has gained from not smoking.  Faye Cunningham is what a lot of us are, a lady trying to find herself.  But she is also much more than that.  She is also a very loyal, and trustworthy friend.  And so on a rainy, dreary day, when she went to the door of Joe Wise, one of her closest friends, to deliver his newspaper, and a strange woman, very rudely answered the door, saying that Joe isn't there, Fay becomes very curious.<br /><br />Leaving Joe's house she goes to the \\"gossip corner\\", a nearby restaurant in town, and finds the former police chief, Mitch Malone, there having lunch.  Not someone she is particularly happy to see at the moment.  I have got to say that I was hooked on A DANGEROUS WOMAN when I read the very first paragraph.  And Ms. Lee did not let me go.  She has created a character, in Fay Cunningham, that most of us can relate to.  A funny, not so perfect, but warm woman, who is trying to find herself after a devastating divorce.  A woman who is so loyal to her friends that she puts own problems on the back burner, to make sure that they are alright, and not in harm's way.  Bumbling along, but not giving up when things don't quite go the way that she wants them to.<br />A DANGEROUS WOMAN is a wonderful cozy, mystery that you will just want to curl up with, and forget the rest of the world, as Ms Lee pulls you into Fay's world.  And you will not be sorry, because you will laugh, you will cry, you will bite your nails.  Ms. Lee writes in such a fashion that it is easy to get to know Fay, and all of the other characters that she brings into the story.  The plot keeps your interest, and makes you want to keep going.  The characters are alive, and breathing.  And you can't help but relate to the wonderful heroin, Faye.<br />If I could order up a friend, with all the qualities I desired, I would want a friend just like Fay Cunningham.  And, I know, after reading A DANGEROUS WOMAN you will too.<br />I just can't say enough about this wonderful book.  I just hope that this isn't the last Faye Cunningham mystery.  A DANGEROUS WOMAN is much too good to not have a sequel.  And believe me when, and if, it appears, I will be the first one in line to get it.

US	50436109	RYGPVOTXMNWAC	0595216862	758906324	Carver: High Mountain Tragedy	Books	5	6	6	N	N	Carver: High Mountain Tragedy	I have to make a confession.  This review is about the hardest review I have ever written.  Not because CARVER: HIGH MOUNTAIN TRAGEDY was a difficult, or bad book.  Because it is everything but that.  CARVER: HIGH MOUNTAIN TRAGEDY is filled with just about every human emotion that can be brought forth, from a human being.  I will try to cover them all, although right now I honestly don't think I can.<br />When I started reading this book, I thought it was going to be another rehash of all the school shooting stories.  It is everything but that.  It is a story that will haunt you long after you put the book down for the last time.  It is a story that is as equally as tragic as Columbine, and the others,  But what happened in Carver, Montana, in 1969, was even more tragic in many ways.<br />CARVER: MOUNTAIN HIGH TRAGEDY takes the reader into the lives, feelings, and the minds of three troubled teenage boys, Bryce Spencer, Kevin Reynolds, and Wiley Coates.  For years the three boys had suffered the abuses and torments of their fellow classmates at Carver High.  The three boys became and stayed the closest of friends fighting this overwhelming torture together, until one day one of the chief tormentors, Mary Clemmons and her friend, Alicia Koppe, took their torment to a new high.  They killed Bryce.  Although it was suppose to start off as a prank, it ended in a horrible death.<br />Wiley took this opportunity to finally even the score with these two tormentors, and talked Kevin into helping him cover up what had really happened to Bryce, in order to take justice into their own hands.<br />What follows is not only gut wrenching, but also goes to show how constant torment and ridicule can result in the changing of the lives of everyone involved, and even those not involved.  It can change the lives of families, and friends.  It can change the lives of an entire community.  This is not a victimless \\"crime\\" in anyway.  The victims are very widespread.  But, like in so many instances, what happened in Carver was not only tragic, it could have been avoided.<br />Mr. Foertmeyer has created characters that actually bring out the emotions in the reader.  In my case I actually put faces to Kevin and Wiley.  I remembered kids that I went through school with that were the brunt of torments from the other kids.  Tormentors much like Mary and Alicia.  And there was always a leader to this, much in the same way as Mary leads Alicia around, and also in this case, as Wiley leads Kevin into getting revenge.<br />Mr. Foertmeyer has a wonderful way of describing the mountains, snow, valleys, and even the nighttime sky.  He actually brings you into this story in such a way that you feel a part of the story, not only with the characters but also with the scenes in which these characters are living their lives.<br />I cannot say enough about CARVER; HIGH MOUNTAIN TRAGEDY.  It is a story that took place in the late 60's but is every bit as modern as today.  It is a story that will take you back to your childhood and make you think.  It will make you wonder if perhaps what you did during those years was perhaps something to be ashamed of, or maybe proud of.  Depending on which side of the fence you were on.<br />CARVER: HIGH MOUNTAIN TRAGEDY should be required reading for every teacher in the country, and it wouldn't hurt if a few parents read it too.  Perhaps, just maybe the story wouldn't be repeated.<br />And to top it off, it is a wonderful, adventure story with twists and turns that keep you reading and won't let you stop.  A definite page-turner.  It kept me enthralled to the very last page.<br />I only hope for more from this great author, Charles Foertmeyer.  He definitely knows how to please a reader, and at the same time make a statement we all need to listen to.  In my opinion, Mr. Foertmeyer could very well be our modern day Samuel Clemons.

US	50436109	R11ODY5C8LBR4Q	0595089755	267287293	Radio Rage	Books	3	1	1	N	N	RADIO RAGE	Benny Taylor is a 40-year unemployed, aging, liberal, ex hippy, working temp jobs in San Francisco.  He had broken up with the only girl he loved, Janet Stewart, over fifteen years ago.  And now lived alone in an apartment, with his cat.  Most of Benny's time is taken up with riding his bicycle through the streets of San Francisco, and listening to talk radio.  Benny has become quite interested in the rantings of a certain right wing, extremist, radio personality Chris Kodiak, and his radical ideas.<br />Meanwhile on the streets of San Francisco a follower of Kodiak has taken it upon himself to rid the city of all \\"deviants\\", according to notes left on the bodies.  Anyone who doesn't fit into the conservative, right wing ideals of Kodiak is a target of this deranged, obsessed fan.  And Benny's ex girlfriend becomes one of these people because she is an outspoken feminist.<br />Benny reads about Janet's encounter with this radical, and her subsequent brush with death, and comes to her aid.  Soon to find that he too, is now a target of the man's obsession to rid the world of what he terms deviants.  His life in danger, Benny intends to meet, head on, this fanatic and stop him from killing, only to find there are larger forces in the movement.  All inspired, and fed hatred, by the words of Kodiak being spewn over the airwaves.<br />RADIO RAGE is a very disturbing account of what can happen when intolerance gets out of control.<br />Most of us, including myself, have heard these people on the radio, television, or read them in newspapers.  Most of us laugh, get angry, or just turn the station.  But there are some out there that take the words that they say, as a signal to do harm to those who they feel don't fit in the mold that they should.  They feel it is their \\"right\\", or \\"calling\\" to rid the world of the \\"deviant's\\" who do not conform to their way of thinking.<br />Ron Danklefs, first time author of RADIO RAGE, has done an excellent job in showing what can happen, what is happening, when a strong personality gets in the position to be able to preach his hatred to people, some of which have emotional problems to begin with.  He does this using the very colorful scenery of the San Francisco life, and an intriguing story line.  I very much enjoyed reading RADIO RAGE.  And the next time I come across one of these radio personalities spouting hate, I won't laugh, or just turn the channel.  I will wonder who else might just be listening to it, and making plans to follow their lead.n, what is happening, when a strong personality gets in the position to be able to preach his hatred to people, some of which have emotional problems to begin with.

Whether it be a stand alone, such as THE DEADLY THORN, or part of her Hawkman series, Ms La Pierre never ceases to amaze me with her talent.<br />Jimmy and Sally Oliver had been married just three months, and Sally couldn't figure out what had gone wrong.  Before they were married, Jimmy had courted her with roses, and had been so gentle.  But after they had said their &quot;I do's&quot; things started to go so wrong.  He became totally controlling, and hit her for things that she didn't understand.  And it was getting worse.  But she still loved him, and thought that things would get better.<br />That was until she received a phone call from a woman who professed to be Jimmy's third wife.  Third wife!  Sally didn't even know that there had been one previous wife, much less three of them.  It seems, according to the woman who called, that two of the previous wives had both died in &quot;accidents&quot;.  Accidents in which Jimmy collected rather large insurance proceeds.  The &quot;wife&quot; on the phone said that she had found an insurance policy taken out on her, while married to Jimmy, and had run away, changing her name, in order to protect her life.  She suggested that Sally do the same before it was too late.<br />Sally searched the house, and found an insurance policy, taken out on her.  She didn't waste any time running.  She ran to her brother, and he in turn let her close friend, and colleague, Julia Evans, know where Sally was.  Sally decided to go to Seattle and inform the insurance company about what was going on, and perhaps find out about the previous wives.  Fortunately, Julia insists on going along.<br />What happens from this point on is so scary.  The reason being is that this can, and does happen across America every day.  It will keep you on the edge of your seat.<br />Ms. La Pierre has done a wonderful job in bringing you into the world of domestic violence.  A world that most of us cannot comprehend, as we have not lived it.  She has shown why a woman would not leave the situation, and stay to be hurt, physically, and/or mentally, and even perhaps killed.<br />Ms. La Pierre also shows that there is help for women caught up in this cycle of violence.  But mostly she shows how important it is to have support, and help, from both family and friends.  With this support, the cycle can be broken.<br />I cannot recommend this book too highly.  It is one that has an awesome story, one that will keep you up all night reading it.  You will not be able to put this book down even for a minute.  The characters are so real.  From greasy, egotistical, sick Jimmy, to Eva Lindsay, who has found the strength to help Sally, and perhaps find out what really happened to the first two wives.<br />Ms. La Pierre does an excellent job exploring what happens to abuse victims, both emotionally and physically.  She has woven this very important subject into a gripping story that is both very spellbinding, and at the same time very educational.  One that you just have to read.<br />My only problem with THE DEADLY THORN is the fact that Ms. Sullivan hasn't come up with a new book yet.  So I will just have to wait until she does, because believe me I will not miss any book she writes.  She is one awesome, talented, author.not lived it.

THE ENEMY STALKS is the first in the series of the Hawkman books.  In this story, Ms. La Pierre introduces you to the most intriguing characters that you could ever dream of meeting.<br />Jim Anderson retired from The Agency after his wife, and unborn child were killed in a car bombing.  He went into seclusion, at Copco Lake, in the Pacific Northwest, under an assumed name, Tom Casey.  Soon after moving there, he captured an injured hawk, nursed it back to health, and the people of the area started calling him The Hawk Man, a name that seemed to stick.<br />Jennifer Morgan, a young widow, is also living at Copco Lake.  She is living a very quiet life in the community, writing wild life stories, and trying to adopt a ten-year-old boy, who desperately needs a home.  That is until she meets Hawkman.  Her life then turns into anything but quiet.<br />Someone does not want Jennifer to have anything to do with Hawkman.  And that same someone is determined to make sure that Hawkman doesn't live much longer.  In trying to eliminate Hawkman, he uses Jennifer as a means to get to his target.<br />I have to say that I am a big fan of Ms. LaPierre.  Her books are absolutely wonderful, and THE ENEMY STALKS just goes to prove my point.  Ms. LaPierre has written an incredible, fast moving, story.  A story, that keeps you on the edge of your seat.  At the same time she has woven this story around the most beautiful scenery. You feel you can not only see the gorgeous sites, but also smell the fresh air, the trees, and actually hear the Canadian geese, as they make their way across the clear blue skies of the Northwest.<br />Her characters are not only exciting, but also very real, and show many facets to their personalities.  Hawkman may be a dangerous man, but he seems everything but that when he is caring for an injured owl, or pulling porcupine quills from a dog that got a little to close for comfort.  Ms. LaPierre's characters are all real and interesting.  They all soon become old friends who you can't wait to see again, and again.<br />I absolutely loved THE ENEMY STALKS, and I can't wait to open the sequel, DOUBLE TROUBLE.  My only complaint about Ms. LaPierre's books is the fact that she can't write them fast enough for me.  I always read that last page, close that book and want more.

Everything was going great until that hot July night in Houston, Texas, when he got into a rental car to leave a fund raising.  Everything changed at that moment.  Not only for Pat Sawyer, but also for a lot of people.<br />One of the people whose life dramatically changed was Dr. Duncan MacDonell.  He just happened to be in that parking lot when Pat Sawyer exited from the car with horrible lacerations, and bite marks, on his face and body.<br />Dr. MacDonell is the city veterinarian, and the only one in the area, at the time, remotely qualified to help Pat Sawyer, before he bleeds to death.  He is also the only one qualified to see just what in the world is in the car that could have caused such horrible injuries.  After stabilizing Mr. Sawyer, Dr. MacDonell manages to get a look into the car and sees a rather large, very irritated, tabby cat.<br />After finally extracting the cat from the car, Dr. MacDonell transports it to his offices to examine, although he already suspects that the cat has rabies, due to its behavior.<br />Things really go crazy after that.  There are problems with the testing; other people are dying around the state, and Dr. MacDonell becomes a target as he begins to unravel a scheme that goes all the way up the hierarchy of the political ladder.<br />Robert Armstrong has written a very powerful novel in INDEX OF SUSPICION.  One that only a person with a strong knowledge in the veterinary sciences could possibly write with such accuracy.  With this wonderful knowledge he has spun a terrifying mystery that keeps you wondering, and guessing, until the end.  The characters are vivid, and the scenes, although at times very disturbing, are very real.<br />You come away from INDEX OF A SUSPICION with the feeling that this could really happen.  And very thankful that there are people, such as Dr. Duncan MacDonell, out there to protect us.<br />INDEX OF SUSPICION may be a work of fiction, but is the idea?

Seventeen-year-old Richard Clifford already had two strikes against him, his father had died recently, leaving him, and his mother, alone.  And he was deaf.  But the worst was yet to come.<br />After a motorcycle ride in the hills, one afternoon, Richard opened the front door, of his home, to find his beautiful mother, and his pet dog, Ruffy, laying in pools of blood on the floor.  Both had, had their throats slit.<br />Richard didn't know what to do.  There was no phone in the house.  The Zanker's ranch was at least ten miles down the hill from the Clifford's little farm, and the only other person living anywhere near, was an old hermit named Jerome who lived up the hill from them.  Both were not home.  What could he do other than to try and preserve all the evidence he could, and protect the bodies from predators until help could be found.<br />And so begins the story of a remarkable seventeen year old, and the people who came forward to help him.<br />After what to Richard seemed like months, but in actuality was only four days, Herb and Elsie Zanker returned home from a visit with one of their daughters.  Herb thought he should take up some supplies to the Cliffords as they were probably running low on things since he and Elsie had been gone longer than they expected.  Upon arriving at the Cliffords farm, Herb found out what had happened.<br />Herb called the police.  While the police were examining the scene for evidence, and recovering the bodies of the dog, and Richard's mother, Tom Casey, Private Investigator, otherwise known as Hawkman by his family and friends, was training the new falcon that his wife, Jennifer, had given him for his birthday in the woods nearby.

You will understand his love for a woman who thought she would never find love.  A friendship with a man who, at first glance, you would think could never have a man as a friend.  And the hatred of another man who actually deserves more hatred than even Duel Winston can heap upon him.<br />Duel Winston is a man on a mission.  He has a woman he wants to marry, and spend the rest of his life with, but cannot do it until he cashes in on two more bounties.  Up until now, nothing mattered to Duel, except the next hard case, but things have changed.  He cannot get the face of the woman, he left behind a year ago, out of his mind, much less his heart.<br />In the past searching for hard cases, and collecting the bounty for them, had been a drive, something he had to do.  It was as much a part of him as eating and sleeping.  But this time it is just a job.  A way to an end.  A way to be with Sam.  After catching and turning over John Barlow, and another wanted man, St. Elmo, Duel will have enough money to set himself and Sam up on a ranch somewhere.  And there will be no more hard cases to chase down.<br />John Barlow is driven to kill Duel himself.  But then again, Barlow loves to kill.  Anyone, and everyone that has gotten in his way has died.  And Duel has gotten in his way, more than once.<br />Mr. Howard has written a wonderful story full of emotions.  You will love St. Elmo and absolutely root for him.  He may be bad, but you can't help but love him.  You will absolutely hate Barlow, and as the story continues that hatred will grow.<br />You will understand Sam, and even understand why she does what she does to live.  Her love for Duel is all consuming.  However so is her fear of him leaving her again.<br />All bets are off with this one.  Lance Howard has hit a homerun.

Nothing else matters to him except to get a record deal.  He, and his jazz band, are good, and they know it.  A record deal is in sight, and that is all that matters to Joe, and to the rest of the band.  They are completely focused on that one end, the record deal.<br />But then Joe meets Zoey Bauer.  The sexist woman he has ever seen in his life.  Now he has problems.  Problems that he never asked for, and doesn't want.  But he does want Zoey.  He can't stay away from her.<br />It seems the day before Joe met Zoey, she had woken up, that morning, to find her boyfriend, Jay Da Volo, laying stabbed to death next to her in bed.  She swears that she has no idea what happened.  But the police, and everyone else, believe differently.  Everyone, that is except Joe.  He believes her.<br />Now it seems that the police even think that Joe may have actually been the one that killed Jay.  Or at least helped Zoey kill him.  And they will not give up until they prove it.<br />It looks like the only thing that Joe can do, now, is find out who really killed Jay.  Because he knows, or thinks he knows, that Zoey couldn't have.  And he definitely knows he had absolutely nothing to do with it.<br />But it looks like the police, his mother, and even his band members want him to leave it alone.  Just let the police handle it.  Better yet, dump Zoey.  Joe just can't do that, if he doesn't find the real killer both he, and Zoey, will go down for the killing.  A murder that he knows they are both innocent of.<br />Ms. Anderson has done it again.  She has come up with another winner.  She takes you on a sexy roller coaster ride that you don't want to get off.<br />Night Sounds will amuse you, make you laugh, make you cry, surprise you, shock you, and make you angry.

There is no information in this summons revealing what kind of help is needed, or even who sent it.  But since he has finished the job, that he had been previously summoned to do, very successfully, he feels that this might just be a way to help him forget the ghosts that haunt him.<br />No sooner has he gotten into town than he is challenged, by what seems to be just another poker player.  No matter what Luke says, the guy is insistent on taking the argument to the ultimate end, death for one of them.  For some reason, Luke cannot let it go either.  Instead of letting the other man's words and actions go by, Luke gets into a fight with him that ultimately ends with Luke having to shoot him, to death.<br />This bothers Luke.  He cannot figure out why he didn't stop the whole thing.  He knows that he could have, but the ghosts just won't let him.  Jamie's death, his lost love, has forced him to avenge her.  He knows he is responsible for her dying, and even though he knows that this will not bring her back, he has no choice.  He has &quot;that itch to kill, to punish&quot;.  He remembers her dying screams.<br />But Luke feels like he is losing his edge.  He is getting older, he is drinking far too much, and the nightmares are taking a toll on him.  Soon, perhaps the next challenger will be the one to end it all for him.  End the killings, end the constant nightmares, end the drinking to forget, end it all.<br />Luke decides that although no one has come forward to give him any clue as to why he was summoned to Bellstar, he will stick around, and perhaps find out.  The longer he stays the more he thinks that perhaps the man in the saloon wasn't just someone who wanted to make a name for himself by killing The Manhunter.<br />While waiting for someone to come forward, and tell him what he has been summoned for, he breaks up an attempt on the life of a beautiful woman, Cynthia Addleson.<br />Cynthia has something about her that almost makes Luke forget his pain.  But can he allow her to get close?  Would it ultimately mean her death if he did?  Surely with more attempts on his life happening, and more to happen, her life would be in danger.<br />Mr. Howard has written a fascinating book.

How are they going to make it through this together?<br />Detective Marty Slade is assigned the case, and he takes it personally.  True had not only been murdered, but unspeakable things had happened to her.  He has to get this monster off the streets now. Unfortunately, through a totally chilling source, he later finds out this monster inhabits the chat rooms on the web, and it isn't going to be easy to find him.<br />Not only are there three different suspects, there is also absolutely no cooperation coming forth from the local police.  Add to these problems, Claire has determined that the police aren't working fast enough, and so she decides that she can find this killer faster herself.  She is going to find him, no matter what.  And she isn't going to listen to Marty, or to anyone else.<br />Ms. Anderson has written a story that will scare you to death.  This could very well be a true crime story, as it is happening each, and everyday in the world today.

Are they really who they portray themselves to be, or are they cruising the Internet looking for their next victim?  And are you going to be that victim?<br />If you do become that person's victim, how are the authorities ever going to find out who harmed you?<br />This is a very real, and very chilling story of what can, and does go on in the world of the chat rooms.  I can't recommend enough that everyone read this wonderfully, written book.  But don't read it with the lights down low, because you will be scared to death.  And in this case that isn't all bad.<br />Ms. Anderson has captured an ugly side of the Internet so realistically, but at the same time has woven a wonderful story around it, so well that it will be difficult (no impossible) to forget.

An innocent, well liked, quiet, and well mannered 15 year old girl, according to some.  To others, who seemed to know her better, quite wild.<br />As the helicopters fly overhead, and the police look desperately for this young girl, an old man sits on a rock, at the edge of the dark woods of England's brooding Peak District, watching and listening to the activity overhead.  Suddenly his black Labrador, Jess, comes running up with something in her mouth.<br />From this minute on you will not be able to put this book down.  The object that Jess retrieves takes you into the lives of everyone in the village.  Secrets are divulged that have been hidden for years.  Just when you figure you have this whole story figured out, you are led down another path.  And then another.<br />Stephen Booth has written a story that will grab you, and not let you go.  The only thing bad about this book is that you don't want it to end.  You want to know more about the people, their lives and what will happen to them.

Tears, frustration, sympathy, hatred..these and a lot  more.<br />I recommend this book very highly, and hope that you read and enjoy  it as much as I did.  If you don't it will be a great loss.<br />This is  truly an unforgettable crime, and even a more unforgettable book.	2000-01-23
