The book itself is lavishly made and the introduction be Geoffry Hartmann makes for interesting reading.  There is one minor disappointment.  Derrida, though obviously possessing an incredible command of the English language was very careful to use French in many of his responses to questions and he makes this act very clear.  There are, of course, a wealth of issues relating to the very act of translation and the translations in the movie istelf are an overt component of the the making/appropriation of the story that Derrida himself is \\"allowed\\" to comment upon in the DVD.  It would have been wonderful to have Derrida's and the questioners French appear in parallel with the filmaker's translations -- dare I say it? a la Spurs/Eperons.  I would be interested in purchasing a French version of the book for this very reason.  I do really like this book.	2005-09-13

One of the wonderful aspects about Gods is not simply that it contains Salters wonderful writing, but also that the editors have managed to collect the best pasages from a number of his books.  After reading Cassada, Burning the Days and the Hunters, I returned to this volume and found that nearly every one of my favorite passages on flying (achieving competence or learning \\"equitation\\" as he puts it at one point) from these books appears in Gods.  And a bonus are the excerpts from Salter's jounals as a fighter jock driving F-86s in combat in Korea:  these sometimes read like poetry leaving an image that has the feel of a Turner watercolor -- a couple of colorful strokes that still give a strong sense of the energy and paradoxically tranquility of moments flying.  Originally in Burning:  \\"I will never see it again or, just this way all that is below.  Some joys exist in retrospect, but not this, the serenity, the cities shining in detailed splendor.\\"	2005-06-30

The accounts of these variuos lives ring true -- for example, if you have ever been a graduate student in mathematics or physics (and are not absolutely brilliant), you likely will recognize the initial optimism, then creeping doubts, etc. that Derman describes so perceptively.  It is the life of the extremely talented, the very, very smart, but not quite having the Nobel Laureate physicist advisor, not quite Area 10 home of the Nobel Laureate economist at Bell Labs (Derman'smyth-dispelling descripton of life at Bell Labs is eye-opening), and not quite the Meriwether/LTCM group at Salomon.  There are wonderful descriptions of what research is like, both in academia and at investment banks, the difference between bank cultures, and a thought provoking explication of the difference between financial economics and physics and the roles of modelling in each.  And there is a good flavor of how one works a problem, both in physics and finance.  This book would have been useful (though perhaps not helpful in maintaining enthusiasm) and sobering to have read before graduate school.  Together with \\"Inventing Money,\\" my favorites on options and banking.	2005-06-30

I bought this book on a recommendation of someone who used it not only in a class in law school, but at trials and I have recommended it to other trial attorneys.  The included summary list of objections alone is extremely useful.  The summary of the Federal Rules gives the foundation for getting a view of the whole picure and allows for quick refreshers, while the gloss on the objections not only reinforces ones understanding of the rules, as well as helping in getting comfortable with getting ready to make the objections at trial.  The information is in a  use4ful readily available, and easy to learn format.  Well worth every penny -- nothing comes close.  I will take this book to trials.	2005-06-20

And most have heard that you need a theme.  A lawyer's credibility is important at trial. More than a few, perhaps, have themselves uttered these lines to themselves and to others.  But what does it actually mean, and how are we to do it?  Even those who have been to trials, actually stood in the well of the courtroom and even won, often don't seem to know.  \\"Runaway jury\\" they will mutter when they lose.  Or what about the famous criminal defense attorney who begins his closing with the stirring:  \\"Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, the state has not satisfied its burden in this case.\\"  Not that he didn't commit this brutal bloody murder, but that the state has not satisfied some legalistic opaque formula of weighing.  Trials often seem to a test of who can do the least bad job -- if both sides drone out their scripts of openings, not daring to look over the podium at the jurors then who can tell who's doing the better job.  Why can't litigators tell their stories convincingly?  First, they may not believe their own stories enough.  Second, institutional pressures, the \\"platooning\\" of responsibilities prevalent in large firms and just simple fear, fear of doing other than the plodding jobs they have seen in court, fear of reaching out and trying to understand the feeling of the decision makers, and their fears may stand in the way.  Also, there is ignorance.  There are countless ways to do things at trial poorly and a mere handful of people who do them really well.  Spence's book addresses the fear, the ignorance and how to be crdible and why.  The example sequences of client inteviews, voire dire, direct examinations and crosses are breathtaking particularly if you have sat at trial listening to the direct by your side in a case you helped prepare thinking \\"what the heck is our guy talking about, I don't understand\\" (and how will the jurors?)  Every trial lawyer should read this, but I hope they don't because it will just make my job harder.	2005-06-20

Much has been made of Slater's self-acknowledged unwillingness to reveal all the details.  But much more is revealed in this book about Salter than the reader could ever hope for from a mass of minute details.  In some crystalline passages, as clear as the view from his F-86, we see him thinking and his mediations on his own thinking and the prose turns to poetry:  \\"Here among them, of what is one thinking?  I cannot remember but probably of nothing, of flying itself, the imperishability of it, the brilliance.\\"  But he shows us the grayness as well as the dark and light of it.  The struggling, the embarrassing ambition and jealousies, as well as the respect and the admirable. It is perhaps not a surprise that \\"Burning the Days\\" is so compelling -- it describes a very full and interesting life.	2005-06-20

For example, the section on the Microsoft action details some of Boies principles in conducting depositions, how one might treat witnesses who will not appear at trial differently from those who will, Boies thoughts on weekend breaks in depositions, etc.  The trial description detail some ideas on the order of witnesses and provides some insight into what Boies thinks of saving useful documents for recross -- I've read elsewhere that Boies likes betting on the horses, etc. and it's clear from his descriptions, he is very confident about when to take calculated chances during the course of a litigation.

Who would have guessed that the future Field's Medal Winner received a C in Calculus II and Physics and that he had a B- average Jr. year at the University of Michigan?  And perhaps particularly heartening to those who have been through the graduate school experience, that he was less favored than Munkries and received an ultimatum from the chairman to improve (and that in graduate school, according to Raul Bott, Smale sat in the back and it wasn't clear he was always paying attention). But, of course, Smale more than redeems himself resulting in a storied career and a reputation that surpasses the boundaries of his specialties.  This is a marvelous book.	2004-12-06

There are a few episodes that I hope were written as being pitched to non-trial attorney types -- Edwards' perplexity in the face of the long winded expert's responses and the \\"revelation/solution\\" of using depo transcript excerpts could not have played out the  way it did -- even bad trial attorneys know to use the transcrpits as impeachment, impeachment being a central reason for taking the depo testimony in the first place. Certainly a trial attorney of Edwards' stellar caliber would use the transcripts in impeachment without hesitation (and probably to devastating effect).  It may, moreover, be safer to save the question for which you have no  corresponding impeachment testimony for the second to lasr question so that you can assure finishing with a florish guaranteed by having impeachment testimony saved for the last question (But then again, I don't have hundreds of millions in jury verdicts and settlements, so don't listen to me).

A real thing of subtle and effective beauty, that closing contains so many incredible and useful techniques, it's just plain stunning.  The subtle allignment of Spence to the jurors in groups in which Spence and the jurors can work together are wonderful and powerful -- Spence places himself and the jurors by turns in a self built retirement community, and in the class of local state citizens all the while emphasizing that the cause of the need for retirement and the genesis of Spence's new  found home state membership is the defense's prolongation of trial -- wonderful.  The rhyming \\"if the lion gets away, Kerr McGee must pay\\" is hard-to-forget and masterfully so.  The analysis that proceeds each transcript is useful and informative.

Get it now -- don't wait!     As might be expected from the title, Steele's book includes an in depth exploration of the Cauchy Schwarz.  It, however, includes so much more -- for example, many, many useful inequalities are set forth in its pages.  But even its richness in range and number of inequalities (and equalities) is secondary to Prof. Steele's  method of explication.  For the real fruit of this book is the techniques and confidence built by the exercises and exposure to the examples.  The exercises feed and bolster confidence in approching or deriving familiar and more importantly, never-before-seen inequalities, a confidence which grows with each page and exercise.  Techniques that might normally only accrete after years of experience in the course of undergraduate and graduate mathematics courses are set forth one after another.  On top of that, this is one of that handful of mathematics books that you can read almost like a novel. It's so readable and rewarding/interesting and engaging  that when people have asked me what I have been reading lately, I can answer with a good deal of pride and satisfaction: \\"a book on the Cauchy Schwarz inequality\\" -- which I never said about Royden, etc.  These techniques are vital for many types of research -- applied mathematics, CS, economics, statistics, (and competitions) to name a few -- in all of these areas finding bounds can play a central role in research.  Well worth every penny.     A 2008 Addendum -- I have had this book well over three years now, and I continue to reread sections and refer to it regularly. I just wish that there were more books like this.  A particular bonus to the experience has been Professor Steele's website relating to the book.  [...]        If you wish to see sample chapters, examine some source materials, or continue the adventure, take a look at the site and you will get feel for some of Professor Steele's unique and wonderful aims in writing this book.	2004-08-20

It provides a nice foundation, making you work at reading proofs and solving problems while getting familiar with the basic concepts -- limsups and infs, basics of continuity, compactness, etc.  You would perhaps be better served if this using this book is not your first experience with really doing mathematics, e.g. formal proofs, etc. -- though not Spivak's Calculus on Manifolds or one of J.P. Serre's Arithmetic books, this book is more concise than many.  Important theorems such as the Stone Weierstrass are proven in a very clean brief way (this may not lead to the most useful of proof styles -- you may find yourself expending precious time on cleaning up proofs -- &quot;does leaving this step in make me look stupid?&quot; -- and perhaps cutting so much that proofs may look &quot;infelicitous.&quot;).  I also do not remember this book being strong on Lebesgue theory and don't remember discussion of Littlewood's principles, Radon Nikodym, etc.  These, the real substance of Real Analysis, are best seen in Royden or Rudin's Real and Complex book.Moreover, some professors prefer the sigma algebra approach to measures -- the wonderful S.

Chang and Kiesler were, however, big names in the field, and at the time I took the class, this book was one of the few that felt like a textbook.  I also remember it as being relatively easy to read.  This may have been why, at the time, it was  chronically missing from the shelves of our math library -- not checked out, but simply missing.  On a recent visit to the same library, the librarian actually remembered the class and that it had used this book -- when he went to locate it on the shelf, it was missing -- he told me that to this day, it is one of the books that routinely disappears from the shelves (as my contribution to the advancement of Foundations, I recently bought a copy to donate to that library -- or perhaps to some impoverished proto-model theorist).

This may be surprising given the physical slimness of the text (I noticed elegance of the exposition and attention to motivation on a recent reread of some of the book after nearly twenty years -- I had not remembered this exposition, perhaps because the reading in graduate school was not quite as &quot;liesurely&quot; (unless &quot;fear driven&quot; and &quot;pressured&quot; are synonyms for &quot;liesurely&quot;).

Here, however, the material is in great part relatively recent - probably the closest to contemporary stuff you can see as an undergraduate -- in Real Analysis, by contrast, you may well just be coming out of the 19th century by graduate school.  This polish, I have discovered in later years, facilitates use of this book for self-study and it is a wonderful text for providing rapid refreshment of important concepts.  I have over the years referred back to it on a number of occassions and have always been pleasantly reminded what a wonderful book it is.<BR>This is a very nice book and the best introduction to the material I have seen (although, given the number of intro books I have seen on the topic, this may not be a strong statement).	2004-06-17

Ethel Waxham and many of her correspondents are of such intelligence, perceptiveness, spirit, and wit that they are, as John McPhee says of Ethel Waxham in  the Forward, irresistable.  The jounal entries and the letters make it clear that the story of Ethel Waxham's journey from Wellesley to the ranch on Muskrat creek just south of Moneta was deeper and more complex than the story of the PBS series.  The endnotes are particularly good -- a story in and of themselves. I do wish there were more pictures of the ranch itself and its surroundings (even from today), &quot;where the gray hills lie, Eternally still, under the sky,&quot; and the people, and I wish that I could know more about Ethel Waxham and the authors of the letters. I also wish that the unpublished sources were available -- as they are by &quot;EPW&quot; and J. D. Love, both of whom are of indisputable eloquence, they would make wonderful reading.

I was concerned that the novel form with its length might dull the crispness and clarity of Ms. Lahiri's prose but the details and descriptions though more detailed are clean as ever and the format permits her to give the story the full flavor of lives where the stories do not end sharply and cleanly.  (The twists of the lives here are in such contrast to the resolutions of short stories, that it made me wonder what happens to the family members in Ms. Lahiri's wonderful The Third and Final Continent after the short story ends -- as a \\"fan\\" of some of the Russian novelists described, my only disquiet from reading Interpreter Of The Maladies was that I found myself thoroughly though somewhat guiltily enjoying what were in some ways relatively \\"upbeat\\" stories like The Third and Final Continent.  The Namsake gives me a hint of what could happen.)  The transition from one character's point of view to another's is seemless -- almost dsquetingly smooth.  And the details (for example Commons, Silliman, Farnam and entryways at Yale) have the effect of some of Kazuo Ishiguro's novels of leaving the reader wondering how it's possible for the author to know and write as if having lived the details.  <BR>I've reread many sections -- one advantage over life is that to see the crisp details of events again, in the Namesake the reader can just turn back, although it almost feels like cheating to do so.  <BR>I have in fact read some sections \\"too many times to count\\" each time captivated by the absurd, tragic, yet oddly inspiring (and ongoing) story of the family. Our hearts go out to the characters who are like our parents, grandparents or siblings and each time reading the acount, for example of Ashoke's apartment or of the last christmas party in the house on Pemberton Road never fail to bring tears to the eyes.  <BR>The odd inevitability of strings of chance events, and all the the unretold moments give The Namesake it's own authentic life.  And Lahiri gives full voice to the feelings of never quite being in the right place/home, that sensation of the Other shared, if not acknowledged by, immigrants and their children and the ambivalence. On the back cover Michiko Kakutani is quoted as saying: \\"Ms. Lahiri chronicles her characters'lives with both objectivity and compassion ...\\" Here even the objects are treated with such sympathy that we wonder what happens to them -- What happened to the crayon rubbings, \\"ignored but protected, gathering dust for years to come\\"?  <BR>This is a wonderful book.	2003-09-18

The inadequacy of Warden's air plan for the Gulf War is elided -- Warden's plan would have had the Iraqis capitulating in an unrealistically short time without ground action. The work of people like David Deptula in making a workable plan is ignored.  Citation of the general dislike for Warden in the Air Force does little to disguise Halberstam's bent.  This is a relfection perhaps of his relying heavily on interviews -- the bibliography shows a troubling lack of the vital works tounderstand airpower strategy, including, for example, Warden's own \\"the Air Campaign\\".  The results of the idiosyncratic rather than systematic choice of written sources can be seen in the focus on the F-117 in the Gulf and the appearance of \\"Bandits Over Bagdad\\" an interesting collection of personal stories by F-117 pilots in the Gulf, but hardly a strategy evaluation.  For Kosovo an insightful assesment is Nato's Air War for Kosovo : A Strategic and Operational Assessment by Benjamin S. Lambeth -- not mentiioned in the bibliography.	2002-04-01

If you have read the story in Richard Marchinko's excellent Red Cell et al., this book provides a fascinating opportunit to hear the same stories from another perspective.  In the same spirit as Marchinko's books, \\"One Perfect Op\\" is not a boastful shoot 'em up, rather  thoughtful reflections showing that even motivated highly-traned SEALs can have doubts, fears and bad luck, but that teamwork and training really work.  It is heartening to know that there have been and hopefully will continue to be people of Command Master Chief Stalker's quality defending our nation.	2002-03-31

This account is well-balanced giving the story from the pro air power and anti airpower views.  It also answers the nagging questions you may have had after reading the incredibly uninformative and shallow accounts in the press.  The book posits the reasons.  An example -- the book provides the reasons for the need for a credible ground threat for airpower to be effective.  Books such as Bombing to Win only state the need.  Detailed, nuanced and spot-on accurate.	2002-01-13
US	51632963	R2GYAXGADQ4ZLV	1560370459	586699967	Boise: The City and the People	Books	5	5	6	N	N	Boise	It has been 20 years since I last lived in Boise.  This book and its numerous color pictures, however, confirmed for me that despite intense growth, the essential character of the place remains the same.  The  strength of this book is the writers' obvious sensitivity to the character  of the place and its people -- a sensitivity that allowed me to make this  conclusion.  For example, although the title says Boise, the authors,  through pictures and descriptions of the rugged and beautiful Idaho  outdoors, display an understanding that Idaho wilderness is inseparable  from Boiseans' notions of themselves.  Very much worth purchasing.	2000-06-19

It provides a further level of understanding not necessarily accessible to those taught the topics of the book in a standard format.  For example, one can learn techniques such as induction and  perform them a formal near mechanical fashion WITHOUT understanding the WHY  of the behavior of relationships being proven.  This book gives you that  further level of WHY.	1999-11-14
