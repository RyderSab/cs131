The characterisation as usual was weak - I never really felt the urgency of Marc's quest for his daughter, or his feelings for Rachel - but I kind of expected that.  What lost the books a star was the truly horrible ending which was completely contrived and depended on a previously cool and rational character behaving in a completely irratic way.   I'm sorry now that I stayed up late to finish it ...	2005-09-08

This book should carry a warning for potential readers - that in order to get anything out of it all you really need to have read all the previous Alex Cross novels and also purchase the sequel - for the ending is clearly not the 'real' ending - more a 'to be continued'.  As I was at a bit of a disadvantage here since this is my first (and frankly probably last) Alex Cross book so all the stuff from previous books like the relationship with Christine was a bit lost on me.  Frankly I was a bit annoyed at the way she was shunted out of the book to make way for a new love interest before I'd even worked out why she was so special to Alex!  <br /> <br />I'm going to give JP the benefit of the doubt since he is a best selling author and assume that his earlier books have been of a higher standard than this thrown-together, formulaic effort.  He seems also to be suffering from Patricia Cornwall syndrome - ie carrying over plots from previous books, leaving trailing relationships, unresolved storylines (minor things of course such as dangerous serial killers still on the loose!).  When I buy a book, as many others have said, I expect it to be complete in itself - sure people who have read the whole series will probably get more out of it - but I still expect it to stand on its own for the casual reader.  <br /> <br />The book started out well but ended as a mess, with a RIDICULOUS last minute twist, no explanation of the Mastermind's motive (probably to be disclosed 6 books later :)). The writing was quite sharp though I could have done with less digressions concerning Cross's perfect family (who were so storybook unbelievably perfect they stretched credibility to breaking point). A subplot involving his daughter having a brain tumour (which she recovered from faster than most people recover from having a tooth removed) seemed particularly pointless. <br /> <br />However I WOULD have given the book at least 2 points, were it not for the ending which was a pure insult to anyone who had paid money for this (thankfully I picked it up free from the bookswap bin at work).  It's an absolute disgrace that a writer can get off with building up to an exciting denoument and then leaving the reader dangling in midair with a last sentence which overturns entirely everything that has gone before.	2005-08-26

For someone who loves boarding school stories for girls I'm amazed it took me so long to discover Antonia Forest. I've never come across anyone who writes quite like her - she manages to avoid falling into the usual cliches of boarding school life (though I must admit I DO love those cliches) and you never feel quite certain that everything will work out smoothly for Nicola, the heroine.  <br /> <br />Since there is no review here I'll briefly describe the book for those wondering where it comes in the series: <br /> <br />Twins Nicola and Lawrie return to school.  Lawrie is obssessed with acting Caliban in the school play 'The Tempest' but has been given the part of Ariel instead.  Nicola is focusing on cricket until some unwelcome news comes which makes her fear for her future at the school.  Ginty is not given a part in the play but concentrates on her swimming/diving.  Ann leaves the Guides as she is now too old to go on. Rowan is working on the farm.  Karen (Kay) is married to an older man and a stepmum to 3 children.  She is living in a farmhouse near the Marlows ... <br /> <br /> I was lucky enough to pick up this copy incredibly cheaply but I'm a bit upset to find that most of her books are out of print and incredibly expensive to buy.  Still after completing my Chalet School collection I need a new challenge!	2005-08-02

This is very much a formula thriller where there are multiple suspects and the killer spends an inordinate amount of time constructing cryptic clues for the police to follow.  There are a few twists - the heroine - an American ex-FBI agent - is a lesbian, the role played by the killer in the investigation(no spoilers but I think this is a first in terms of motive, didn't totally buy it though).  I did guess the identity of the killer pretty early on - again no spoilers - but in my experience if there is an unidentified dead body in a thriller focusing on who might have the motive to conceal a victim's identity often  leads to the killer. <br /> <br />Formula thriller aside I  rather like the atmospheric descriptions of Dublin and would have liked the novel to focus a bit more on Grace and Saxon's relationship.  I would probably read another book by this writer out of curiosity if nothing else.	2005-06-03

I really wasn't expecting much from this anthology but I was pleasantly surprised. It starts out poorly with a few hit and miss stories but it improves as it goes on and some of the stories are King at his best.      My Synopsis  ===============  Autopsy Room 4:  No as terrifying as I expected it to be.  The humorous tone reassures the reader that everything will come out all right in the end.    All that you love ... It has some atmospheric appeal but it plods on too long and the ending is a damp squib ... also what's with SK's bathroom obsession? Are we seriously supposed to care about the fate of a guy whose hobby is deconstructing bathroom graffiti?    The Man in Black: Has all the faked up 'horror' and irrelevance of 'From a Buick 8'.  Yet again SK  introduces a piece of cheap bathroom humour which destroys any credibility this piece might have had ...     The Death of Jack Hamilton:  Pure and utter filler.  It plodded on forever -I nearly gave up at this point.     In the Deathroom:  Starts out well, but King never achieves the Kafkaesque mood he aspires to - too many heavy hints that the hero will make a heroic escape destroys the tension for the reader.    Little Sisters of Eluria.  Sorry didn't read this one, the words 'gunslinger' were enough, I don't rate King's attempts at fantasy.      Everything's Eventual.  This was the first story to show real promise.  It goes nowhere in the end but this was the point where I started to hope.    Theory of Pets.  This reminded me a lot of vintage King stories such as 'The Body' which, while not particularly frightening, show off his story-telling skills at their best.    The Road Virus Heads North.  This frightened the wits out of me - the first time I've been moved to check the doors and windows by a SK story in a LONG time ...      The Gotham Cafe.  Doesn't quite work, but nonetheless left a lasting impression on me.    Things you can only say ...  The second best story in this collection IMO.  I had to keep reading it over again to savour its meaning.    1408.  The best story in the collection - in fact one of the best he has ever written.  Borrows a lot from 'The Haunting of Hill House' but none the worse for that.    Riding the Bullet.  Unlike most other people this was a new one for me - and it worked in a very basic way.  Probably by this point I would have been spooked by my own shadow. I had forgotten my old rule - never read SK after darkness falls. Not really necessary with most of his latest stuff which is more likely to prove a cure for insomnia, than induce it!    The Luckey Quarter.  Just read this one on my way to work.  Not frightening but is a moving  depiction of the effect of poverty on a woman's hopes and dreams.      So only seven stories out of 14 I can praise wholeheartedly - but I felt it was worth the 4 star rating for those alone.	2005-05-24

I rather enjoyed 'Night Sins' so when I found this book on sale for 1 at a local discount store I thought 'how bad can it be?'  The answer is very very bad.  It combines the worst Mills & Boons cliches - beautiful stubbornly independent heroine, ruggedly handsome hero, who, needless to say, fight constantly before falling into each other's arms, with a plot borrowed from the cartoon 'Scooby Doo' - ghosts - hidden gold - mysterious characters wanting to buy property - sound familar from Saturday morning TV?  She should definitely stick to writing thrillers.  On a more happy note the brief preview of 'Ashes to ashes' at the back of this book looked good.  Bet I don't get it for a pound though!	2005-05-10

If you're getting sick of the latest bloated and self-important novels of the likes of King and Koontz this book is the perfect antidote.  No it hasn't the most original plot of all time - in fact it is one of the good old staples of horror fiction - family moves to idyllic rural location finds villagers engaged in ancient pagan rituals - but none the worst for that. Any seasoned horror fan will know exactly where this journey is taking them - and Simon Clark doesn't disappoint.  Sure there are plot holes - the fate of Paul's girlfriend being an obvious one - and the book feels as if it was dashed off in a hurry to meet a deadline-  but IMO the exciting pace and the subdued horror of the ending more than make up for it.  This guy can really write and I don't understand why he isn't a major bestseller on both sides of the Atlantic ...	2005-03-02

I haven't read a Kay Scarpetta novel since 'The Body Farm' as I was getting sick of all the gore/body parts.  When I found this book in the book swap bin at work I thought it would at least pass the time - something a bit gross maybe but a fast paced exciting read.  How wrong I was - I admit it did pass the time but I had to force myself to plod my way through it.  The story focuses far too much on Kay's personal life, on different forensic procedures on government organisations and their sophisticated equipment - all at the expense of the story.  Despite all the gross-out descriptions of dead bodies/horrible diseases the whole thing left me curiously unmoved. Perhaps because all the characters apart from Kay have become one-dimensional cutouts. The ending is a total damp squib - she just seems to have picked a minor character out at random to be the killer - and lots of plot points - such as the Lucy storyline are left totally unresolved - probably to sucker the reader into buying the next book in the series!  However for me the major problem for me was that Kay had become a character I disliked intensely - she was so rude and arrogant to everyone - so neurotic and set in her ways that quite honestly I didn't care if she got smallpox - in fact I was hoping that Cornwall would just kill her off, as I think she's really sick of writing about this character now - and it shows ...	2005-01-11

I must confess I haven't read any Chalker for ages - I went through a phase of devouring the Well of Souls books, when I developed a taste for complex fantasy which you have to read with one finger in the glossary/map to keep checking not only where you are but WHAT you are in the fantasy world. This book isn't a bit like the WOS books, though having said that it is a kind of prequel, so maybe it isn't representative of the rest of the series.  It describes how the world of Flux and Anchor was first set up and the science behind it is truly fascinating. It is similar to the WOS world in that human beings can be drastically altered by interactions with the computers which control their environment. I must admit I did become annoyed at the number of times an intelligent, career oriented female became turned into a simple busty bimbo, but what the hack, in Chalker books it kind of goes with the territory.  He probably imagines this stuff is only read by teenage boys anyway!	2005-01-07

I suspected that Cecilia might be the daughter of Bertie Ahern - and when I had finished the book I was almost sure.  I know that at present every attractive young Irish woman seems to have had a novel published, but surely if she was an unknown this badly written, immature rubbish would have been sent back with a 'thanks & don't give up the day job' reject slip?  The subject is a serious one - but I feel this young woman has no idea of the reality of the situation.  The heroine - whose name I've already forgotten is supposedly 30, has been married for 10 years and has just lost her husband after caring for him over a period of sickness.  She comes across more like a twenty year old who's just split up with her boyfriend.  Such a dire event would change a woman forever in ways I don't think the young author can even begin to comprehend, and she would surely feel anger and betrayal as well as straightforward grief.  Certainly it wouldn't be something which could be cured by a few letters from beyond the grave and a spot of karoake!  I kept forgetting that she and her friends were in their late twenties/early thirties - they seemed much more like teenagers. The writing style is also dire and it surprises me that this was ever accepted for publication.  All in all a disgrace that this was published and it is a decidedly sub-standard piece of work and certainly not worth what I paid for it.	2005-01-05

The beginning is great - truly disturbing especially the clocks and the freaky mirrors - the end is great (though not a great surprise to anyone who bothered to find the biblical quotation quoted by Neil's brother) the middle sags a bit.    Probably the worst things are the all-knowing 'divine dogs' - I seriously felt like putting the book down when they turned up - but it could have been worse - at least none of them can talk! Molly and Neil are also the stereotypical Koontz couple - so saintly I expected them to be caught up to heaven at any moment. They don't feel real to me either just like puppets for the author to express his own prejudices.  He uses weak devices to carry the plot along - Molly just 'has a feeling' that a whole family who live near them (containing two kids and a dog!) are all dead - later on she plunges into the most unlikely places to rescue kids whose existence she can only speculate about. The whole thing 'dogs as divine guides' is an especially lazy device and kills suspense - how likely is it that these bands of saintly dogs/saintly children and saintly hero/heroine will be harmed in any way?    I also found it puzzling that  NO-ONE put a religious 'last times' interpretation on the events - even Neil who is an ex-priest? Why don't they look up the biblical quotation mentioned by Paul?  I kind of felt the whole alien invasion theory was forced on us like a card, so Dean can make this astounding revelation in the last chapter.     Still for all that the book is readable enough and in a strange way Dean's lurid prose works well with the subject matter.  However time and time what started out as beautiful poetical prose goes way way over the top and I found myself skipping forward to where the action starts again.  We are told that Molly - who is a writer - savagely edits her own work- what a pity in this case that she didn't write the book.  Dean still has a lot of talent he just needs to be a bit less self-indulgent and excise some of his favourite whimsy about self-aware dogs and personal prejudices about modern life... Books should be fun for the reader not the writer - after all we're the ones who pay hard cash for them!	2005-01-05

Karin Slaughter relies on bombarding her readers with one shock after another - but if you actually sit down and think about what's happening the whole thing starts to unravel.  For one thing it relies on Sara Linton being either incredibly stupid - in failing to identify that her patients are being abused - or being incredibly clever at catching a paedophile ring. Why would police fail to suspect the mother of a seriously abused girl of any kind of involvement?  Also the identity of the dead baby's mother just doesn't make sense when you think about - how could she have kept it hidden for six months?   <br /> <br />Not a book I am likely to add to my collection but an exciting thriller which works well enough - as long as you don't pause to think about too much!	2004-09-28

I seemed to remember that Maeve Binchy said she was giving up writing novels after 'Scarlet Feather' - so far two novels have appeared under her name but to be fair, both appear to have been written by a computer.  I can imagine a lot of her fans will gush over NOR&S as it does keep MB's trademark feelgood factor but what it dispenses with is strong well-written characters you can identify with and an intricate and compelling plot. Please don't be hooked into buying this in hardback as I did just because of the Binchy name - this is her worst effort yet (if indeed she DID write it).  The plot is completely unoriginal and predictable (in fact there's barely enough material for a short story) and the characters two-dimensional and impossible to identify with.  For example it was easy to see why Ria in \\"Tara Road\\" fell for loveable rogue Danny, yet impossible to see why Fiona is attracted to her violent boyfried Sean who is simply a charmless oaf. The way the four main characters get together and the attachment they feel for each other I found simply unbelievable - the 'tragedy' which brings them together doesn't affect any of them directly and has only a minor role in the book. Sorry to sound hard-hearted but in reality they would probably have forgotten about it pretty quickly and gotten on with their lives. The only possibly interesting character has her life story told only in flashback (which actually would have made a better story line) while the book focuses on the boring lives and predictable romances of four dreary people who for the most part are totally responsible for their own problems.  To make matters worse some of the Non-Irish characters have Irish speech patterns (did no-one edit the book?), at one point a Greek character describes someone as a 'pup'.  I found this book deeply frustrating as it DID have the trademark Binchy warmth and I kept waiting for the plot to kick in only to be disappointed. All in all her weakest yet.

I must admit I found it hard to get excited about this book - in fact I even forgotten that I'd bought until I found it abandoned in a carrier bag.  This was something that would have NEVER have happened a few years ago - I used to devour DK's books in one sitting - but his last few efforts were have fizzled out after a chapter or two and led me to have seriously lowered expectations of this author... <br /> <br />It didn't start out well.  I found the narrator irritating and totally unconvincing as a twenty-something - he sounded like a mouthpiece for Dean's own prejudices.  As for his love interest Stormy I couldn't decide whether I found her irritating or totally charming.  Worst of all I felt I could see exactly where he was heading and predict everything that would occur ... Then something happened.  There was an unexpected twist, the book took off, the irritating over-use of adjectives stopped (or at least dropped to a level where it didn't interfere with the plot) and I became totally engrossed in the story.  By the end I decided that I liked both Odd and Stormy, I was blown away by the ending (unusual to say the least with a DK book).  OK the actual premise for the story is not his best, but what he does with it is a great improvement to books such as 'From the Corner of his Eye' for example.  Could an editor have been let loose on this writer at long last, or has DK finally realised that readers want him to tell an exciting story, not overload them with descriptive prose/his own prejudices or irritating subplots about aliens?

I was a bit underwhelmed with 'The Lovely Bones' - started out great, lost me entirely by the end - but I expected great things of 'Lucky'.  Yet again it starts out well, the opening chapter is horrifying, moving and completely unputdownable - but as we move away from the actual rape and its immediate aftermath all Alice Sebold's faults as a writer surface again.  She seems unable to select material which will be of interest to the reader and fills pages and pages with irrelevant detail of her family life and unnecessary background detail. The book comes alive again when she spots her rapist in the street but in between I found myself losing interest.  We all know the argument about real-life not being as tidy as fiction - but in this case it WAS tidy - the rapist was identified by Alice, caught and punished (a much more satisfactory ending than that of 'The Lovely Bones', ironically). I wish the book had been more scrupulously edited to focus on the essential elements of her story rather than filled up with padding. I felt cheated at the end of the book - at the beginning I felt that I would be with Alice throughout her every step of her journey to find justice and recover from the trauma she suffered but somehow this connection was lost and by the middle of the book I had no idea what she - or indeed anyone else involved was thinking or feeling.  What a shame as this could have been a truly great book and an inspiration to rape survivors everywhere ...	2004-06-24

I expected it to have some more emotional depth - if someone had told me that the movie (which I haven't seen yet) had been written first and this was derived from the script I wouldn't be surprised. The whole thing is predictable right from the start and the characters are pure cardboard.  There wasn't a single development I didn't see coming pages away.  The only remotely interesting characters are the horse and the little girl who is hurt and towards the end of the novel they are sadly neglected in favour of an affair between two people who ought to have known better. Needless to say moral issues are ignored in favour of overwhelming sentimentality and characters undergo the sort of personality changes usually not seen outside the world of soaps - eg a ruthless and ambitious businesswoman suddenly seems content to become a stay at home mother.	2004-06-07

The best I can say that it is very uneven - I LOVED the parts about the restaurant and the relationship between Rose and Anna, but I'm afraid that Anna's romance with Mason left me cold.  It feels like something simply tacked on to give the book a romantic interest and I can't help feeling that the author didn't have her heart in writing these scenes. I skimmed over those bits in the end (especially when Mason was going on about wild birds of something) and I wish she had just concentrated on the restaurant and the relationships between the people who worked there - that was fascinating and I was constantly being amazed by the honesty and astuteness of her writing.  I don't know if the publishers made her put in a love interest so the book would sell but I feel it would have actually been a great book if it had only focused on Anna's relationship with her aunt and her employees at the restaurant.	2004-03-25

Well it seems like my last review was not published for whatever reason so I'll try again.<br />I found this book a BIG disappointment after Shutter Island and Mystic River.  It seems like DL set out to write a Thomas Harris style thriller without realising that one of the strengths of say SOTL is the contrast between the cool dedicated professionalism of the crime fighters contrasted to the erratic violence of the psychopath.  When you make your 'good guys' just as violent and uncontrolled as the bad guys you are kind of missing the point. DL should have also bourne in mind that it's a mistake to make your hero and heroine wise-cracking detectives if<BR>a) you can't write any wise-cracking dialogue for them;<BR>b) they are so slow that the reader is usually several pages ahead of them - so why are they detectives at all?<br />Characters like Bubba and the various gangsters introduced belong in a comic rather than a serious novel and by overloading us with evil killers the few truly menacing moments lose the impact they should have had. Also surely I'm not the only one sick to death of the man/woman detective team with the 'will they won't they' relationship (Mulder and Scully were bad enough). <br />However the book DOES show talent and certainly remains engrossing right to the end (though if I had known what the ending was like I probably wouldn't have bothered). I really hope he has left this sort of immature parody in the past and goes on to write more books like Shutter Island.	2004-03-18

Ok well I'm getting old - I must confess I found it impossible to sympathise or indeed comprehend in any way the behaviour of the heroine in this novel. Either young women have changed out of all comprehension or the novel was written by an alien whose sole knowledge of  the human race was based on watching badly written sitcoms.  I was never convinced that Tash felt anything other than sexual attraction or a need to gain status out of her relationships and as for the advice given by her friends - well I longed to bang their heads together! There are supposed to be sucessful thirtysomethings?  Plenty of thirteen year olds have a far deeper insight into what makes successful relationships.  The debates about sacrificing passion for lasting happiness in relationship to Tash's feelings for Adam made my head hurt - I shudder to think that impressionable young girls are being given the impression there there IS no middle ground between trying to force yourself to fall in love with a platonic friend and falling into bed with every man you meet!  I was never even remotely convinced that Tash really loved Adam and their whole relationship just seemed incestuous and a bit icky ... The motto of the whole book seemed to be - anything to get a man and not be on your own and frankly I found it a bit sad to see the same old stereotypes about marriage recycled from the sixties.

Well I did manage to struggle my way thru to the end - but then I was stuck in hospital with nothing else to read and at least Eddings' turgid prose took my mind off all the injections, crap food etc. My first impression was that this hodge-podge of characters, gods etc. was what you would get if you mixed together large snippets of Tolkein, Moorcroft, Peake, Chalker with perhaps a smidgen of Buffy the Vampire Slayer in a blender. Ok to be fair it IS the third book of the series - perhaps if I'd read the first two I might understand the convulated rules  governing the various gods/demons/heroes but even so I couldn't help feeling the story had plotholes a mile wide. For example, given the powers that Aphrael has why can't she help the human characters a lot more?  Why do they have to plod around fighting all the time?  Way way too many characters, too many silly names, confusing side plots, lack of coherent rules (vital in fantasy!) to say nothing of the fact that many of the 'heroes' are cruel and vicious and unfair.

First of I must say that I've never seen the film - I was drawn to read this book - and indeed anything Dennis Lehane had written - by having read his wonderful novel 'Shutter Island'. This book didn't grip me in quite the same way but it was still an enthralling read.  The biggest problem I had is the whole thing is so depressing - there is the sense of a tragic fate hanging over the characters' heads, the sense that they are already doomed by the class and the neighbourhood they are born into.  The identity of the killer was pretty easy to guess - all the evidence is there once you get on the right track but that isn't the real climax of the book, so in a way it doesn't matter.  I would certainly recommend it but with the warning that is very much a downer - don't read it if you are feeling seriously depressed!	2004-02-19

I loved AP's writing style and wanted to be drawn into the stories. However the problem was that once was I was in the stories I wasn't sure I wanted to be there - I found the subject matter a little too depressing - I had imagined stoical countryfolk living bleak but dignified lives against a magnificent, uncompromising landscape.  Instead I was a little taken aback by the undignified and squalid behaviour of the charactors and how they all seem doomed to end up unhappy.  Surely their are SOME happy marriages/parent-child relationships in this part of the world?  I liked 'Brokeback Mountain' but the rest of the stories seemed a bit samey.  I've never been to America but based on AP's view of it, I think I would give Wyoming a wide berth!<br />In some ways Ms Prolux reminds me of Thomas Hardy - the same tales of lives predestined to unhappiness against the uncaring splendour of nature - but unlike Hardy she appears to lack a sense of humour/or any compassion for her characters.  Her characters have no nobility, hence it becomes difficult for the reader to empathise with their plight.	2004-02-13

The writing was good and there are some very moving moments but overall I didn't feel I could award it more than 3 points.  For a start the historical period felt wrong - the book didn't feel like it was set in Victorian times and Sally was just unbelievable - she just felt like a modern heroine transported there in a time machine(perhaps he should stick with fantasy). There is a sense of political correctness running through the book which seems more in tune with the 21st century than the 19th ...  The books just seemed too childish for an adult and way way too brutal for a teenage reader.   OK the same could be said of the DM triology (it took me weeks to get started on the second volume after the end of the first) but there at least I felt it was worth it.  Here I was just really gutted and upset by the events of the novel and I felt the ending didn't make up for it ...  There is one marvellous moment when Pullman seems about to pull (pardon the pun) out one of his incredible surprise twists - but no - he plays it safe after all and the book has a conventional ending. I guess I'll read reviews before buying any of his other stuff.	2004-01-07

This is the type of novel where you read the opening chapters over about 30 times but struggle to finish the rest of it.  Alice Sebold excels at the sections which are her own experience thinly disguised as fiction but on the evidence here she's no novel writer.  Unfortunately Alice paints herself into a corner by killing off her best character right at the beginning of the book (ok she's still around to narrate the story, but she has no interaction with the other characters which limits her effectiveness).  Instead of carrying on with the story of Susie's murder and the consequences she fills the remaining chapters with boring stock characters and situations gleaned from popular fiction and films such as 'Ghost' and 'The Sixth Sense' (the alcoholic grandmother in particular seems to have wandered in from another novel).  I felt very cheated by the conclusion - especially as the author teases us by suggesting that Susie's body will be found and then moves on to a completely different - and ridiculous payoff.  The only thing that kept me reading was the hope that the killer would be caught (in real life even the dumbest cop could hardly fail to suspect him); that Susie's body would be found and buried;  that her family would be granted some kind of peace and that Susie herself would be empowered to move on to some new stage and break away from the past.  I'm not going to go into the bad writing, unbelievable behaviour of characters (sample: a recently bereaved father tacitly encourages his only remaining daughter to break into the house of the [person] who murdered her sister!) or numerous continuity errors here but where was the editor?  Someone should have told AS that her manuscript needed to be completely redrafted before it got to the publication stage, but then I guess they know this kind of stuff will sell shedloads of copies so why bother?	2004-01-06

I enjoyed 'Bookends' and 'Babyville' but from the start I had a major problem with this book - the heroine, Libby, is such a shallow gold-digger I found it impossible to sympathise with her.  Why should we root for her to marry the nice penniless Nick when clearly this is a woman who is cut out to be a trophy wife in a loveless marriage, a shallow mindless bimbo who  defines success in life totally as a matter of money and designer labels.

If Donna Tartt had not been the author of best-selling book 'The Secret History' I doubt if this rambling book would ever have been published. I expected an intriguing story of a young girl doing some detective work to solve her brother's murder, instead Tartt just uses this initial premise as the opening gambit for another character-driven novel about the American South.  All the stock characters are there - the matriarchial grandmother, the ditzy aunts, the neurotic mother, the devoted black servant, the crazy redneck family, the fanatical preachers.  Suffice to say no cliche is left unturned and after a promising start the book rambles on for pages and pages with nothing happening. It gets better towards the end (though some of the kids' escapades were about as convincing as Scooby Doo) but the ending - well the ending made me lose the will to live.   I guess the message is don't expect your curiosity to be solved - this is no simple detective story  - it is a piece of GREAT AMERICAN FICTION.  What it honestly feels like is that the Tartt had a bad case of writer's block and had to force every word of this long uninvolving, rambling epic on to the page.  A waste of my time ...	2003-10-13

The heroine, Cari,  is so scatty that she makes Bridget Jones look like a model of sanity and I found the tale of her trials and tribulations rather amusing.  However once the author begins to tidy up the loose ends and everything begins to come up roses I lost interest rapidly - the ending is far too far-fetched and worst of all sounds like something devised in a writing class.  Also that I realised that I didn't really like Cari very much - and I didn't think she deserved her good fortune.  Basically she is bone-idle and just sits around worrying about calories and hoping good fortune will fall into her lap.  It also rather irritated me to read about a heroine who seems to rely totally on men to run her life - and what sane woman would invest in a scheme proposed by dodgy businessman Nigel?  Still the book IS very funny in parts - and the accounts of one character's nervous breakdown is very moving.  I hope this lady goes on to develop her own style and breaks away from the conventions of the chick-lit novel ... she needs to let her character's suffer the consequences of their actions and not be rescued at the last minute by some deux ex machina device ...	2003-07-31

This is a potentially a better novel than Divine Secrets - more honest and hardhitting but I'm afraid it was spoiled for me by the way it was written - split down between several narrators. It is too bitty and distracting and some of the narrators - especially Big Shep are so boring that I skipped past their part.  When I'm reading a novel about a dysfunctional family I want to read about THEM and what makes them tick, not a load of rubbish about catfish or something like that.  Essentially the story is about the relationship with Sidda and Vivi and I think that Wells should have concentrated on that instead of giving a voice to so many other characters.  Also having read the prequel I understand even less the fuss about the YaYas in Divine Secrets - about their unique style/friendship etc.  In this book they come across as a bunch of rather vulgar women who spend their entire time getting drunk.  Vivi is particular is a horrible mother and a horrible person who deserves to be punished for her actions rather than getting off scot-free.	2003-07-30

The 'secrets' revealed were a disappointment - sure Vivi had some hardships in her life but I certainly didn't feel this was an 'explanation' for the cruel abuse of her children.  She comes across as a self-centered, irresponsible drunk - for example does she ever think about how hard life must be for the black ladies whom she dumps her kids on at every possible opportunity - that they might rather be with their own families? The whole book tends to glamorise issues such as alcoholism and child abuse.  Sidda is entitled to her anger and I found the Ya Yas attempt to sweep the whole thing under the carpet despicable.  Vivi might have benefited from less adoring friends, who might have told her some home truths about her behaviour.	2003-07-21

Essentially SK follows a lather rinse repeat formula - the same spooky events occur over and over again padded out by a lot of boring waffle.  For example about 4 pages are taken up by a description of two characters spilling coffee on a woman's skirt and buying her flowers to make up!  And this has NOTHING to do with the plot. Most of the story is told in flashback by a number of narrators to a young boy, whose impatience with their refusal to get to the point could be seen to reflect the reader's growing impatience ... SK takes the opportunity to rebuke these readers via the narrator chiding the boy for being obsessed with supernatural events - nothing is ever that tidy in real life, blah, blah ...  At this point I began to suspect that the book's ending would be a major disappointment with nothing explained or resolved - and I was right! Actually I don't mind novels that digress from the main storyline (&quot;3 Men in a Boat&quot;, is one of my favourite books) but in &quot;From a B8&quot; these digressions simply aren't interesting and do nothing to add depth to the leading characters in the book who are all one-dimensional. Also I don't need SK to tell me that real life is not full of tidy resolutions but I expect better things from fiction!  Kind of hard to believe that this is from the same author who wrote 'The Body' ...	2003-06-09

I'm grateful I bought it from the library and didn't waste any money on it.<br />The plot is quite unbelievable and boring - I found it impossible to believe that the heroine would be so obsessed with the death of a woman who is essentially the local baglady 20 years or so after it happens. I also found her liberal white condension towards Annie, the lady who dies, quite offensive. The major reason though was that after the first few pages I knew that a lot of cats would probably be killed quite horribly and I never read books where there is gratituous cruelty to animals. I simply put the book down and don't read any further - and in this case the story was so uninvolving it was easy to do.	2002-12-05
US	51897209	R6ZJKZDTBC9EV	0525946829	616631756	Quentins	Books	3	8	9	N	N	Writing on autopilot	Overall I was very disappointed with Quentins - it felt a bit like warmed up leftovers - the characters weren't as fully rounded as those in her earlier books and their motivations were hard to fathom. Surely an intelligent well-broughtup girl like Ella wouldn't fall for the 'my wife and I live separate lives' line? Whereas I really empathised with Ria in 'Tara Road', Ella just irritated me by being totally stupid - especially the business with the laptop. The worst thing about this book however is the format - Ms Binchy doesn't seem to be able to decide whether she is writing a novel or a collection of short stories. The book isn't all bad - it has many of the usual Binchy touches - but my overall feeling is that if she is this tired of writing, maybe she should take a long break until she comes up with some original ideas ...	2002-12-02

For the first few pages I entertained the hope that SK might be back to something of his old form. However I soon noticed that no sooner had the story started to get interesting than King would switch away to another storyline, completely killing the suspense. The plot lacks originality and owes a great debt in particular to the Alien films. It is rambling and incoherent and I suspect that without the King name it would have never seen the light of day. He has managed the feat of writing a book which is way way too long yet failing to fill in many important details of the past which are hinted at all the way through the novel. The so-called plot twist at the end was just confusing and left me wondering why I bothered to finish the book.	2002-11-12

Ten years after Summer of Night, Dan Simmons returns with a sequel which is (IMO anyway) a distinct improvement on the original. When I first read Summer of Night I felt it was a rip-off of 'IT' and a disappointment from the author of Hyperion.  However I feel that I should warn Summer of Night fans that AWH is NOT really a sequel at all - there is hardly any connection with the events of the first book though a few characters do reappear. What really impressed is that unlike some authors I could mention (step forward Mr Stephen King and Mr Dean Koontz) Simmon's writing style has matured with the years and he has avoided the trap of over-writing which so many have fallen into - instead this is a slim volume of around 200 pages in which not a single word is wasted.	2002-10-11

I didn't HATE it, but I didn't like it as much as I did the Talisman.  Both the authors have suffered from excess wordiness of late and they could have used the services of a good editor here.  Yes the novel does offer the occasional gem but you have to hack your way through a forest of needless words to get there. Worst of all, I didn't feel they were taking the fantasy elements seriously and the ending is an insult to the reader. Fantasy only works if the author is totally committed to the alternative world he creates and if it has clearly defined rules.

There also were a few plot elements I found quite unbelievable - for example why on earth would a rich gay Tory MP marry a working class single mother like Zillah? Surely with all his money he could find a far more suitable person to take part in a marriage of convenience. Also I liked the character Minty at first but by the end of the novel she reminded me too much of Dora from 'The Killing Doll'.  I would recommend the novel to anyone who likes a good read, but would warn fans of suspense and mystery not to expect too much - this has none of the plot twists and turns of her earlier Barbara Vine books.	2002-06-28

I really enjoyed the way the story developed what must be a wish fulfillment fantasy for many people - to simply walk away from your life and start again afresh - into a believable outcome - you find a new life very similar to the old one, and people react to you in a similar way.

Clayton's work in the past, so I had little or no expectations for this book.  It began well, but many romantic novels do only to descend into standard cliches.  For example many authors feel the need to portray their heroine in a totally sympathetic light and her main rival as entirely unworthy and this never happens here. Daisy the heroine is beautiful, intelligent and quite irritatingly competent but in many ways her friend Min is more likeable. Both of them have irritating yet highly endearing flaws. When Min's inadequacies are highlighted - her untidiness and lack of domestic and mothering skills - at first I expected a payoff - but as I read on I realised that the author was describing reality - good people have major faults and that's just the way life is. It was refreshing to read a book where I found myself surprised by plot developments, and compelled to read this book through at a sitting.  Nor was I disappointed by the ending, which was genuinely moving, while avoiding melodramatic excess.<br />I look forward to reading more of this author's works in the future.	2001-06-04

To put it quite simply 'The Residence' is unreadable trash.  The characters are pure cardboard, the plots are laughably bad and the writing style - well words fail me.  Amateurish, bathetic, over-inflated cliche - &quot;He was gripped by a sense of overwhelming terror&quot; ...- that kind of thing.  We are continually reminded that the atmosphere is 'terrifying' characters are 'gripped with fear' - or possibly 'palpable menace' - real authors gradually draw us into the characters' emotions they don't rely solely on adjectives! The overall impression is that of a 13 year old who's just discovered H.P. Lovecraft trying to imitate his style of writing.  The author is obviously attempting to shock, but sadly he is no Clive Barker - some of the book is revolting, but none of it is remotely original (sample, eyes gouged out, rats gnawing intestines), and since all the characters - victims and villains alike are something less than one-dimensional the impact on the reader is zero. How I wish that this book had included a 'read an excerpt' option then I certainly wouldn't have wasted any money on it. One paragraph - or perhaps sentence - would have been enough ...<br />PS.

In fact I found that as a more mature reader I appreciated the depth and poeticism of GRRM's writing even more than I did as a teenager.  <br />So - the best book I ever read?

Needless to say this was followed by disappointment when I realised how much of his work was out of print and difficult to obtain, so I was delighted to read on Amazon.com that &quot;The Land of Laughs&quot; was to be reprinted.  <br />This story, like most of Carroll's work, starts out set firmly in the real world, but as it progresses the boundaries of experience are shifted, until it becomes mind-blowingly surreal. Somehow - and this is the true strength of Carroll's writing - I found myself accepting even the most outrageous ideas as if they were somehow natural and inevitable. <br />I must say that I didn't like the ending - not that it wasn't the right ending, or even the inevitable one, but I just didn't want it to end up like that for the characters involved ... or for the book to end at all, for that matter ...	2001-02-08

A friend lent me this book but told me not to bother returning it - to give it to a charity shop if I didn't want to keep it.  She thought it was quite amusing but nothing special - and when I had read the book I agreed with her.  There is nothing new or original here and the book is not even very funny.  I found Bridget very childish and self-obsessed for a woman in her thirties - in fact much of the book reminded me of a diary I used to keep when I was fourteen!   I thought H.Fielding was trying to copy the Adrian Mole diaries without really succeeding - probably because Sue Townsend is a much funnier writer. <br />This book reminds me of the Harry Potter series in that it seems to have been hyped up into becoming an international best-seller, without really offering anything new to the reader.  It's a averagely good book to read on the beach - not a scintillating insight into the life of a single woman ...	2001-01-26

The only reservation I had was that I had already read much of the book in other anthologies - and in no case had I been overly impressed - but surely there would be something new to make the book worth buying?  Boy was I disappointed!  Most of the stories (e.g. Popsy, My Little Pony) are so weak that I doubt they would have been published at all without the Stephen King name.  My guess is that they were rejects he had been hanging on to for years, until he could use them as filler when he was short of original ideas. There is NOTHING here that comes near the standard set by 'Skeleton Crew' or 'Night Shift' or even 'Four Past Midnight'.  Nightmares indeed ...	2001-01-25

While I was reading this book I had mentally awarded it a five, even from the first few pages.  Susan Hill evokes a wonderful, eerie vision of Victorian London, and the novel kept my attention all the way through.  It is essentially an old fashioned ghost story, about a man who returns from the colonies to London in the latter half of the last century and begins a quest to discover the truth about his own mysterious past.  It is an extremely well written story and I was filled with anticipation about what would be revealed at the end - how all the mysterious clues would tie together - but I am afraid that the ending when it came was a big disappointment.  I felt that Ms Hill has no more idea than the reader about how the book should end, and the startling plot twist I was hoping for never came, so despite my enjoyment of the bulk of the novel I can't give it more than 4 marks.  I would still recommend this book to other readers because of the excellent standard of writing and the wonderful Victorian atmosphere it evokes - and I also admit there is a possibility that I missed some hidden significance in the ending which will be crystal clear to other readers!	2001-01-16

I don't think I've ever read a D.Koontz book which had a more intriguing premise or started out with more promise.  The first few chapters were riveting, especially as I found it impossible to predict what would happen next, and I was genuinely surprised at a few of the plot developments.  However about half way through the book loses its way and becomes a meandering mess.  The villain (I won't name him) starts off as a truly menacing and unpredictable character - but as the book progresses he becomes more of a comic character.  He is also killed off far too soon - I lost interest in the book after this point.  The 'children with miraculous powers' are familiar from 'Sole Survivor' and needless to say play a 'deus ex machina' role when required to do so.<br />Dean also makes the mistake of introducing too many minor characters who are of no interest in themselves and distract from the action. The reason 'Intensity', for example works so well is that all the action revolves around the two major characters and this intensifies the reader's involvement.  The book is also far too long and could have been cut down to half the size without sacrificing any important plot elements.  What DK needs is a good editor  though I suppose at this stage of his career there isn't much chance of that!   What a waste to see a talented author producing self indulgent stuff like this.	2001-01-04

I found this book more gripping than her earlier two and unlike them it held my attention to the end. <br />The simplicity of the plot - the nightmare scenario of an ordinary decent woman (who happens to be 8 1/2 months pregnant) kidnapped by a maniac, and her husband's desperate attempts to trace her - works well and remains convincing.  It is particularly frightening because it could happen to anyone - what woman hasn't felt nervous of a stranger who seemed to be paying too much attention to her?  The way it all begins to escalate out of control seems all too believable and hence terrifying.<br />The only flaw I found in the novel was the depiction of the FBI agent and the police in the scenes with Rich - I would have expected them to be a bit more professional in their behaviour. However the scenes with Didi and Lyle are always convincing, and Lyle manages to remain a terrifying figure with unscrutable motives who nevertheless comes across as a real human being and never becomes a cariacature ...<br />I'm not sure if fans of &quot;Red Leaves&quot; and &quot;Tully&quot; would enjoy this book because it is such a departure in style and is also (in my opinion) much more violent and frightening but I'm sure that anyone who loves fast-paced thrillers would enjoy it.  I'm looking forward to PS's next book after this one ...	2000-11-19

The introduction to this book makes it clear that the author is to some extent drawing on her own experience of being abused as a child and, probably for that reason, the sections of the book dealing with the abuse of the central character are powerful and moving.  Why didn't she stick to that?  Sure the central theme 'successful authoress abused by famous evangelist' (no spoilers the blurb on the back cover is fairly explicit about this) was enough?  Why does she feel she has to drag in so many other characters and (sometimes unbelievable) storylines? The story starts out powerfully and then get bogged down in all these thriller-by-numbers conventions.  By the end I had lost interest altogether and skimmed ahead to the end to see what happened - a sure sign that an author has lost the plot.  <br />The blurb at the front of the novel 'if you love Mary Higgins Clarke you love Meg O'Brien' did worry me - but in fact MHC, though her novels are too formulaic for my taste can at least write a concise gripping thriller. Meg O'Brien, on the evidence of 'Crashing Down', can't - though she can write - as some sections of the book show.  A semi-autobiographical account of her own experiences and feelings would have been a much better than have them embodied in a standard and uninteresting storyline ...	2000-11-17

When I picked up Harvest Home in a second-hand bookshop I had pretty low expectations - I'd read other works by the same author and been decidedly underwhelmed. Once I'd read it I decided that perhaps all writers have one really good book in them - they just need to find the right subject matter.  The fact that I guessed the dark secret of Harvest Home by about the middle of the book did nothing to spoil my enjoyment - and I have to say that the ending of the book is amazing - dark but amazing ... Sadly this book now seems to be out of print - but my advice would be if you  see a second hand copy for sale snap it up!  My guess is that it's a book most people will hang on to because they want to read it again and again.<br />My verdict: One of my all time favourites - not great literature just a really entertaining read	2000-11-02

I quite enjoyed PS's novel &quot;Red Leaves&quot; so I was pleased to find a copy of &quot;Tully&quot; in a second hand bookshop. This starts out as an intriguing story of a girl &quot;from the wrong side of the tracks&quot;  who rebels against her abusive mother by entering dance contests and sleeping around.  When her life is marred by a further tragedy I could feel nothing but sympathy with her and wish her the best for the future.<br />But the eponymous heroine DOES turn her life around surprisingly quickly.  She marries a great guy who loves her (probably more than she deserves as she has been two-timing him) has a child goes back to college and has a rewarding career.  As far as I was concerned from this point on the book lost all interest as it seems to turn into the story of a woman who has everything doing her best to destroy it by her inability to come to terms with the past.  For pages nothing much happens in the way of plot and the book just seems to drag on to a predictable conclusion.   One gripe - it annoys me the assumption that female readers will  naturally identify with this sort of character no matter how badly she behaves - as if they agree that a right to &quot;self-fulfilment&quot; justifies trampling over other people's feelings.  To be honest I felt more sympathy for the male characters, particularly Tully's long-suffering husband!	2000-10-30

I think she is a very talented writer but to be honest  I found this book a bit of a disappointment.  The first half of the book is  great but after that I found it began to drag a bit. I think Ms Simons  makes a major mistake in killing off her most intriguing character so early  on.  After the death I found myself  rapidly losing interest into what  turns into a stock murder mystery and all the secrets so adeptly hinted at  in the first part of the novel seem to be thrown away in the second half.  Also I didn't find the police procedures convincing or believable despite  the fact that Ms Simons has clearly done some research. <br />However don't  let this put you off reading the book - it's still head and shoulders above  most of the dross published these days and I would have awarded a five on  the strength of the first part.

I quickly became engrossed in this book and felt a lot of empathy for Annie's plight when her husband decides to leave her.  However as the book  progressed it became apparent that it would never amount to more than a  sickly sweet romance and that most of the characters - apart from the  heroine and a few others - would be cardboard cutouts.  At the point when  she pops into Lurlene's salon for a makeover I got that sinking feeling  that I didn't want to meet another stereotypical American character and  felt that I could accurately predict Lurlene's behaviour and dialogue in  advance - and how right I was! <br />The book is full of this kind of sloppy  writing, which in the long run completely destroys its credibility. How  convenient for Nick that Annie turns up when she does and takes over the  parenting role that he has neglected, considering that (at this point of  the story) he is neither a lover or a relative just an old friend.  There  is also no mention of whether Annie is paid for caring for Izzie (though I  would guess that she doesn't need the money anyway).  Personally if I had  spent years caring for a man and a child only to be cast aside I don't  think I would be so keen to rush into the same situation again.  <br />I'm not  saying this novel doesn't have its good points - certainly the relationship  between Annie and Izzie is very touchingly portrayed but it is certainly  not what the blurb on the jacket promised.  It is certainly not about a  woman 'finding herself' or finding any form of enlightment it is simply  about a woman who exchanges a unsatisfactory relationship with a man who  doesn't love her for a better relationship with a man who does - (a stock  plot for romanctic novels) but apart from that does not change her  essential role in life (a dogsbody) in any way at all.	2000-08-08

I thought that writing on a simpler  theme might bring out the best of his writing but somehow it never quite  comes off.  As several others have also commented, Trisha is far too  precocious for a nine year old girl.  For example, at one point, early in  the novel she remarks that her mother and brother's quarrelling is like a  'sick kind of love making'. Come on - what nine year old would make a  comparison like that!<br />I just found it hard to identify with Trisha and  her perils and somehow I don't think King could either.  I can see why  people who haven't read any other King stuff might think it was a great  book, it really isn't bad in itself but compared with earlier stuff like  Cujo or the Long Walk it is a bit of a disappointment - but not a massive  disppointment, as I don't think (apart from The Green Mile) that Steve King  has written a really good book since the late eighties.	2000-03-30

The score is not meant to be derogatory - I would reserve  a score of 4 or 5 only for books which I found to be exceptionally good.  This was a fairly enjoyable read, but overall I found it quite predictable.   The plot, in the hands of someone like Thomas Harris, could be  nailbitingly suspenseful, but somehow MWW never really convinces me that  the children are in danger and Samuel Mordecai is never quite the  terrifying figure that the author intends him to be.  Fair enough, very few  writers can really enter the mind of a psycopath (a couple of exceptions  which spring readily to mind are the already-mentioned Harris and Stephen  King). The best part of this book for me was the Emily Dickenson poem from  which the title is derived, which I never seen before. It has an eerie  haunting quality which sadly the book completely lacked.  <br />But for all  that it was a fairly entertaining read, and I would certainly be happy to  pick up this author's works in the library or second hand.

The male characters in particular are shallow and exist  only to provide a love interest for Vix/Caitlin. <br />One of the strengths of  JB's writing for children is the simplicity of her style but sadly  translated to an adult novel this simply doesn't work.	1999-10-14

As soon as copies appeared in the shops, I would buy one and settle down to an evening of enjoyable gluttony.  Often I would devour a book at a  sitting.<br />Somewhere in the last ten years it's all gone wrong, and I must  confess that I didn't even manage to finish Rose Madder and Desperation -  just flicked to the end to see what had happened.<br />So when I picked up  Hearts in Atlantis at an airport bookshop it was with no great expectations  - in fact I didn't start to read it until nearly 4  days later.  So I  suppose in this state of mind at least I was fairly immune to  disappointment, and indeed I was not disappointed.  The book is ... not  bad.  The first story &quot;Low men in yellow coats&quot; is probably the  poorest - it starts out well and builds up likeable and believable  characters then SK has to drag in elements from the dreadful fantasy the  Gunslinger.  &quot;Hearts in Atlantis&quot; is, in my opinion, the best in  the collection and the rest are also ... not bad.  Nothing in this book  comes anywhere near, for example, &quot;Different Seasons&quot; but it far  encompasses the appalling &quot;Nightmares and Dreamscapes&quot;.

The blurb &quot;Love Story for the Nineties&quot; should have warned me off, but having read the book I realise that this was a compliment to it - in fact it doesn't even reach this level.  This portrayal of two young people in love never rises above a Hollywood-type fantasy where two beautiful perfect people share a series of corny romantic moments - including (so help me God) making love on a beach - you can fill the rest in yourself from any stock romantic comedy. There isn't a single character in this book who isn't a cliche and I found it impossible to feel any sorrow when tragedy strikes these cardboard people.

The characters are essentially the same - with a few rather pointless changes, Cynthia from ROSE MADDER (easily SK's worst ever novel) is there - as if I needed reminding of RM! Again the central idea - an autistic child who has amazing powers to bring his toys to life and generally terrorise the neighbourhood is spoiled by making him an ESSENTIALLY GOOD child who is possessed by the evil entity TAK (the &quot;evil child with amazing powers&quot; isn't even a particularly original idea, it was done infinitely better in J. Bixby's short SF story IT'S A GOOD LIFE).  Perhaps the worst thing about this novel and the reason why it doesn't work is the cardboard nature of the characters. They seem divided into GOOD or EVIL without the familiar human foibles and failings which make characters such as Gard in the TOMMYKNOCKERS or Jack in THE SHINING so believable.  Perhaps the worst example of this sort of writing is the scene where the BAD character (Cammie or something like that) wants to blow Seth's brains out and the rest of the GOOD characters agree this would be wrong because he is essentially a GOOD person.  Come on, I can just about accept his aunt feeling like that about him, but I can't believe that a load of people in this situation would feel like this about a child they had never met - who is putting their own lives in danger.  Think of King's novelette THE FOG where a group of assorted characters are trapped in a supermarket by forces beyond their control - and begin to crack under the pressure and behave in increasingly bizarre ways. THE REGULATORS, however, is not without redeeming qualities and if SK had made a different use of the material I might have enjoyed this novel.  I like the Motokops toys coming to life and feel that this novel could have worked better as a satire on TV shows such as POWER RANGERS and theeffect they have on children's minds.  The western film stuff seems entirely unnecessary and to my mind would have been better left out	1997-08-11

Quantity is not quality and some ideas would be better condensed into a short story or novelette, rather than stretched into a full length novel. DESPERATION, which starts out well with its theme of a good guy turned bad sherrif picking up unwary travellors, quickly loses the plot and degenerates into a farce where characters we neither know or care about are killed off by a monster which is neither believable or frighening.  The last 100 pages or so are, in my opinion, quite unreadable, unlike the companion &quot;Bachman&quot; novel THE REGULATORS which starts out as a mediocre novel and remains mediocre (and just about readable) right up to the end.  One of the worst aspects of both these books is instead of a long build up to the central horror of the book (cf PET SEMATORY &amp; THE SHINING) King gets stuck into the violence right away - but without the buildup we never come to care about the characters who are killed, so the potential impact is lost.  This is particularly sad as there are no shortage of lesser horror writers who introduce a constant stream of one-dimensional characters whose only role is to be killed off on the next page, in some particularly gruesome way.   I really regret that I parted with hard cash to pay for both DESPERATION and THE REGULATORS.  Next time Stephen King publishes a novel, no matter how favourable the reviews, I'll wait to borrow a friend's copy or a library one.  By the way I note that that there is no fore or after- word from the author in either of these books - I wonder if this signifies a sense of shame at foisting this second-rate work on his faithful readers?	1997-08-11

This is simply one of the best, most disturbing horror novels I have read for some time. I have a habit of judging novels by their opening pages and this book opens with a tour de force which draws the reader him/herself into the nightmare of drowning. I think it is fair to say that the rest of the book is even more disturbing and the ending still haunts me ... a must-read for horror fan	1997-05-15

Tightly plotted, gripping and suspenseful with characters who continue to live on in the mind of the reader.  There were times when I was literally too scared to turn the page. Though King has written other great books I believe this is his masterpiece and I really really hope that some day he writes another book of this calibre!	1997-05-15
