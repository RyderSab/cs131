And, after reading the beauty that was The Sparrow, perhaps my hopes were too high.  With that said, I found that this book just did not measure up with what was happening in The Sparrow.<br /><br />First, Russell's timeline was stretch a bit too much this time.  The Sparrow worked on the plot at both ends and the end of the book was kinf of the actual middle of the story, where we find out the truth of was happened.  In Children of God, there is also the jumping around, but it is more disjointed and in some senses follows three timelines - a literary technique that helps her do some things, but is too confusing, at least for a dummy like me.<br /><br />Second, there was too much complexity in the plot - ambiguities in the intents of the characters and even too many characters than were warranted.  It diffused the themes of the book and made for tough slogging at times; \\"slogging\\" is what I should be doing with my text books on Hegel's philosophy, not Russell's clearly capable writing!<br /><br />Finally, I guess I just don't think she should have resolved things, the questions that were asked in The Sparrow.  I know (you have to know the end), they are not totally resolved, but the implicit suggestion is that Emilio can find meaning in his suffering.  To be honest, I have the same problem with the book of Job too, but I like the tension and unanswerable questions raised in The Sparrow.<br /><br />I wish I could rate this better, but this is my humble opinion.	2005-10-11

Lewis' Perelandra series have a read a book that can be properly catergorized as \\"theological sci-fi\\".  The premise sounds odd: a group of Jesuit priests (and others) journey on a mission to Alpha Centauri to meet with the beings who emitted an intelligent radio signal.  The priest who started the mission is the only one to survive (not a spoiler, as this comes out right at the beginning) and his faith is completely shattered.<br /><br />This book asks the age-old tough questions of God and is both brutally honest (and honestly brutal!) and yet respectful of the Christian faith.  Russell knows her Scriptures and does not make light of deep theological issues.  Nor does she evade the deeply troubling realities of suffering, even - or especially - by those whose faith is strong.<br /><br />It is only at the end that we find out what \\"The Sparrow\\" means (if you know your Bible, you can figure it out a bit) and it is treated briefly, but with heavy poignancy.<br /><br />The structure of the book is brilliant.  It kind of approaches the story from both ends; there are flashabcks, but the present and the past eventually meet.  After putting the book down, I had much tot hink about and I am eager to read the sequel.<br /><br />This is one of the best books I have read this year.<br /><br />Read and Enjoy!	2005-09-06

His call for reclaiming the narrative character of the Bible found in his first book, Eclipse of Biblical Narrative, serves as a backdrop of this book, but is by no means necessary to be able to read Identity.  Much of Frei's writings are somewhat ponderous and difficult to read, but Identity - originally written for church leaders - is much more readable than is typical for Frei.  Moreover, what Frei is saying in this book is enormously fresh and revolutionary, and has spawned several theological papers and theses (including my own Master's thesis).<br />The essential point Frei is trying to make is that we need to come to the gospel stories without the baggage that so often is attached to the modern liberal understanding of reading texts.  Instead, what we find in the gospel stories is the &quot;unique, unsusbstituatable identity&quot; of Jesus Christ as being the one about whom the stories are about.  It is about him and no other.  It is not a moral tale, nor is it an instance of human religious conciousness, nor is it a purely historical document in the way that modern eyes and ears perceive history.<br />The gospels, for Frei, are &quot;history-like&quot;, but are not meant to give chronological and &quot;factual&quot; information.  Rather, Jesus is the irreplaceable person around whom Christian dogmas are centred, not the other way around.  This point must be well-heeded even today by both liberals and conservatives who try to use the gospels either as religious metaphors or apologetics.<br />There is no doubt that, though MORE readable, it takes times to really let Frei's point sink in and the reader will need to digest this book slowly to realize the amazing work that it is.<br />Read and Enjoy!	2005-06-03

Rutledge preach a few times and attend an all-day workshop and I was forever affected by her engaging style and thoughtful analysis.  She is a highly theological thinker who is a very well-read person.<br />The Bible and the New York Times is just that: an exploration of popular culture and the Christian faith that is neither sugary nor ignorant of the realities of suffering and pain.  Rev. Rutledge is able to bring sound biblical exegesis and a vibrant style to her writing that is only surpassed by actually hearing her in person.  Following the main days of the church year, this book helps the reader to pause and think of how the various days of the church calendar are relevant to modern people with faith.  She brings out the rhythm of the people of God as they try to live out their faith in a secularized world, but she does so without resorting to easy or pat answers.<br />Read and Enjoy!	2005-06-03

As Barth's personal assistant, Busch has insights that few can match and a style of writing - even when trasnslated - that is accessible and engaging.<br /><br />The Great Passion teases out for the reader the main facets of the enormous influence of Barth's writing, a theologian who has been referred to as the greatest theological thinker since Thomas Aquinas.  Some may find the prospect of reading Barth's enormous corpus daunting, but Busch is able to, in only a few hundred pages, paint a picture that is fascinating and informative at the same time.<br /><br />I recommend this book to anyone who is interested in learning Karl barth in detail - both the uninformed and experts alike.<br /><br />Read and enjoy!	2005-05-12

I am not a pastor, nor do I feel \\"the call,\\" (yet) but this book is one of the only ones that make me want to preach!  Why?  Not becuase I think I can put out a whiz-bang, knock-their-socks-off sermon, nor because Barth's book gave me some good ideas to preach on, but because Barth portrays sermons to be a truly theological task - not something most preachers I hear these days believe, nor would agree with.<br /><br />\\"Theology is sermon preparation...\\"  This is one of the quotes in this book that essentially showed me that preaching CAN be redeemed, if only more people would read it.  Preaching is expounding the Word of God to the Church...pure and simple.  It is not meant to evoke a psychological response (though it may) and it is not about the preacher's own experience.  The preacher is one with humility before God whose lips merely mumble in response to reading the Bible.<br /><br />Listen preachers: read this and Charles Campbell's book \\"Preaching Jesus\\" and your sermons will be world changing; better put, the world of the bible will change the world of your listeners through your sermons.<br /><br />Read and Enjoy!	2004-08-26

So, I was questioning reading this book about St. Patrick - significant saint -who Lawhead thinks he can write about in only ONE tome!<br /><br />Well, Lawhead can do it.  He ably and remarkably covers the major part of this man's life, engrossing the reader and telling a fascinating and mystical tale.  Is it historically accurate?  I highly doubt it - but this is why it is under the FICTION section!  Is it theologically orthodox?  Not really....but Lawhead never makes claims to be a theologian.<br /><br />This is a fun story that is involving and interesting.	2004-08-05

Anyone who takes Christianity seriously and who has a certain amount of introspection (which the Left Behind series does NOT appeal to) will love this series.<br /><br />A warning to my fellow protestants: this book is unabashedly Catholic.  If you are uncomfortable with minor Mary veneration and a greater focus on relics, you may sometimes be annoyed.

With &quot;Identity&quot;, the reader will be able to see Frei using the argument in &quot;Eclipse&quot; with reference to the person of Christ.  Interesting enough, this book was actually written prior to &quot;Eclipse&quot;.<br /><br />The argument of this book is essentially this: to know the identity of Christ, the particular person who is Jesus of Nazareth, is to know his &quot;real&quot; presence.  This astonishing claim is central to the text.  It is up to the reader to determine his success.<br /><br />Some may find Frei to be difficult to read; it took me taking a course and essestually being forced to read him that I was able to finish it, but it was well worth it.	2003-01-12

Let's start of by saying that at times I find the arguments of Intelligent Design proponents worthy of at least thinking about.  Michael Behe does make one think, and Sawyer takes his ideas and uses them in what I think is his most ambitious work to date.<br /><br />Traditional theists and traditional evolutionists will not like many of the ideas in this book.  Remember it IS fiction, but of course, Sawyer seems to see that both sides have some merit to their arguments.  In THIS book, theists seem to win out, but I think that this is consistent with Sawyers other books which indicate that there is SOMETHING out there, somehow.  I found this to be an honest perspective of a scientific mind who understands both sides of the debate.<br /><br />At times, he makes characatures of evangelicals...we are not believers of Duane Gish's horrible Creation Science, and I think I have a healthy scepticism of intelligent design theorists.  Yet, I still am an evangelical and Sawyer allows that there can at times be some scientific arguments out there, though I nor many people think they are by any means conclusive.<br /><br />Right until the end I was enthralled with this book, but it is the end that seemed to be hastily written and unfulfiling.  On the other hand, perhaps it is just too hard to write about meeting God.<br /><br />Read and Enjoy!	2002-09-29

I love the ideas he comes up with - some of them are remarkably plausible and his knowledge of scientific principles is clearly expansive.<br /><br />Frameshift has several strands of plot that are neatly weaved together that make for a very entertaining and captivating read.  The mix of genetics, Nazi war criminals and big-business conspiracy theories kept me up late into the night wondering what was going to happen.  What is particularly fascinating is Sawyers idea that there may be something to the \\"junk\\" DNA that all humans have and what they could mean.<br /><br />My only complaints are that Sawyers characterization of women does not seem quite accurate and that there are times where the plot takes some unbelievable twists.

I like how Xavier takes on their form through radical surgery and tries to infiltrate their culture.  The rest of the novel highlights Xavier's continued quest to be like other aliens, becoming increasingly uninterested in ever being a human again.<br /><br />What I found frustrating was how the mystery of the Fireflies was never resolved.  The book description made me think that the reader is to find out the reasons behind their strange mysticla practices, and instead we are left hanging.  The book shifts too quickly into a story that just doesn't fulfill my expectations.  A lot more could have been done with this story.	2002-08-20

There is rarely a dull moment in this book; moreover, the idea of viewingt he future for a brief amount of time and the issue of future immutability is one that certainly has interesting philosophical implications.<br /><br />With that said, it is hard to take this book a seriously as perhaps Sawyer would wish.  There is little explanation for the phenomenon of the \\"flahsforward\\" event.  Futhermore, world reaction tot he event reveals Sawyers excessively bright view of human behaviour.  There would be much more than the brief anger and confusion that resulted from many people dying - there would be wars, more death and horror, not logical acceptance!<br /><br />In essence, this is a mystery novel; a man tries to find out who his future murderer will be, and on that level the book succeeds.  It would seems that Sawyer is trying to do too much with this book and is not able to come through.	2002-08-17

The bookds have sold millions and continue to be made at a staggering pace (I think at the time of this writing there are 10 books in the series). Although an older book, this is a wonderful beginning to a correction that is essential for the poor biblical exegesis that is wrought by authors such as Leyahe and Jenkins.<br /><br />One statement in the book stands out for me: \\"Scriptures deal with some problems we do not have, and do not deal with problems we do have.\\" As a result, many Christians commit the oft-repeated \\"this is that\\" error when they read the news headlines. This has been done for centuries, displaying a dangerous view of prophecy. Green offers a realistic view of Scripture, that prophecy is not always as clear as we think it is, while showing that there are yet meanings that we can grasp at the same time.<br /><br />Green examines what prophecy really is and highlights the necessity to put prophetic literature into its context instead of the \\"proof-texts\\" that are wrenched from their localized meanings. He shows the importance is symbolism, and its resultant problems as well.<br /><br />This almost 20-year old book is as important as ever. I challenge people who think they understand prophecy (especially pre-millenialists\\" to give this a fair reading and make their own judgments.	2002-08-13

For those who love theology as I do, this is a masterpiece of theological analysis that goes intot great detail into one of Luther's great treatises.<br /><br />On initial perusal of the Heidleberg disputation, one may not be familiar with the issues that Luther wished to address at the time.  Known perhaps more popularly for his 99 theses, this disputation is more clear example of Luther's thoughts on what being a &quot;theologian of the cross&quot; really means.  Forde challenges anyone to, with Luther, be very careful in acting more like a &quot;theologian of glory&quot;, as Luther put it, than a theologian of the cross.  The latter instance is more difficult, for it means believing in a God that underatnd suffering, a God that is scandalous in his desire to be known as a god who is known for showing power in extreme weakness, in a human that hangs from a cross.<br /><br />On the other hand, Forde is careful not to let Luther's disputation put forth a view that theology is about a &quot;suffering&quot; God per se, but that we do not know God through lofty ideas such as &quot;omnipotence&quot; and &quot;glory&quot;.  Forde, using Luther, brings balance to the concept of grace, sin and suffering.<br /><br />This book is a must for those interested in issues durrounding the Reformation and Luther's theology of grace.	2002-08-11

He did an excellent job at immediately immersing the reader into the plot right from the beginning and I had a hard time putting this book down.  Literally a page turner, I went through this book much faster than I usually do.<br /><br />Sawyer touches on a wide assortment of issues: AI, quantum computers, the meaning of being human, and many more - all tied together with suspense and intrigue.<br /><br />At times, the book gets a bit too &quot;new-agey&quot; perhaps, and I found the drama to reach points of corniness.  Moreover, it was several times suggested that Cheetah was to clearly an Ai and not human, yet &quot;he&quot; acted with such feeling and apparent emotion that Sawyer seemed wildly inconsistent on this point.<br /><br />On the whole, I really enjoyed this novel.  I may be biased since it is located not only in the city in which I live, but at the University of Toronto, where I study.  So it is fun to read a book where I can identify all the locations (though he forgot about the Catholic seminary also being associated with the University).  A fun read!	2002-08-11

I have learned that there are more books about the Xeelee and now I want to find out more about these mysterious creatures who have such advanced technology.

Nonetheless, as I try to be objective, this book does an excellent job indicating the many &quot;gods&quot; that are worshipped today in our culture.  While idolatry may not now include bowing down to hand wrought images, we still look to ourselves, New Age ideas, Narcisissm or other ideas that pervade out culture.  Moore especiallly is good at indicating the &quot;realtivist dilemma&quot; that is such a strong aspect of culture today.<br /><br />I think that one of the best chapters that has struck me througout the years since I have read this book isa the one on pragmatism.  People are likely generally unaware that we all too often think in short-term, &quot;practical&quot; terms without considering that such approaches may yet be wrong.<br /><br />This book is a challenge to Christians and non-Christians alike.

As a physics teacher, I will find it interesting to have a discussion about this scenario and I hope to bring up this book in class.<br /><br />Baxter needs to work on some of his descriptive abilities, on the other hand.  Granted, it may be my problem, but I was unable to picture some of the things he was trying to describe in the book and I think it lacked in being able to effectively describe what something looked like.<br /><br />All in all, this book has some great imaginative features, and Baxter is someone I am happy to read again.	2002-08-01

In addition, it is always good to see what Glitsky is up to next and what is happening with him.  He is a good character, almost a kind of anti-hero that is rare in this genre of literature.<br /><br />With that said, in this case, I was happy to see more of Glitsky, not to mention Hardy, the enigmatic Freeman and the rest of the gang, but found the plot to be a bit too convoluted and contrived to really be believable.  In the end, we aren't really shocked by who the killer is, and has happened in Lescroart's other mysteries.  Sure, we wonder about the details, but I don't want to read over 400 pages just for that.<br /><br />I would say to read most of Lescroart's other books to get a taste of what he can do rather than read this one.  He can do much better.	2002-07-31

It was a mystery as to why the aliens came, why they did what they did and how humans were meant to be a part of their plans.<br /><br />And so, the end of the book came and...well, there were no answers to any of these questions.  At the risk of ruining the book for those who haven't read it, the answer is that...the aliens simply left Earth without any reason as to why.  We asre never given any answers to these questions and it made me feel as if most of the book was filler.  Perhaps I needed to read it more as how accurate the book was in telling how earth would react to this situation, but I really felt that Silverberg put a great deal of \\"fake creativity\\" into this novel.  What i mean by this is that he came up with intriguing things that he alens did and the reader is left being fascinated with why the alens would do these odd things....so the answer is simply that we do not know.  To me, an author who does this indicates that he has the creativity to come up with interesting ideas, but lacking the creativity to at least fill inthe holes to give some kind of satisfaction to the reader.<br /><br />I was not looking for some big war at the end, or a smah 'em up book, but at least some kind of resolution.

I love Sci Fi, and there WERE parts of this book that seemed interesting, but - well, call me a prude - I just could not get beyond the distasteful sex acts in this book	2002-07-10

He does this without losing what he sees as the essential &quot;Scripture Principle&quot; that must remain if one is still to be called a Christian.<br /><br />What Pinnock does is opens up the fields of form and historical criticism as being useful fields for the evangelical without compromising their faith.  He shows that Scripture is entirely reliable for the use for which it was intended, but our modern view of documents and &quot;scientific&quot; objectivism have caused many evangelicals to enter intot he realm of fundamentalism rather than thoughtful, honest inquiry.<br /><br />There is no doubt that some would be uncomfortable reading this book, as it would perhaps make someone feel that the result is a &quot;low&quot; view of Scripture.  Rather, Pinnock wishes to &quot;walk the line&quot; between decetic inerrantists and liberal theologians who wish to do away with orthodox Christian beliefs.<br /><br />The concepts really is not that hard.  If we believe that God has spokent through the Bible, then what is wrong about bringing honest questions to it as we read it?<br /><br />Read and Enjoy!	2002-04-17

It has been a while since I have sat down with a book that is simply just mediocre.  The writing is filled with as many one word paragraphs as words it seems, and the plot stubles along to a predictable ending.<br /><br />I am not sure what makes these books popular.

In this second installment, I would contend the same complaint, although I think that the series is starting to grow on me (which I suppose it had better after 1200 pages!)  This volume continues right where Volume 1 left off, and does not waste time trying to reacquaint you with the previous stories; if you don't know it, too bad!  I kind of like that, although it would be difficult for readers who take time between books.<br /><br />Sometimes the story still gets repetitive as the characters are shunted endlessly from one simulation to another.  Given that Otherland is an alomst infinite series of simulations, Williams is in danger of trying to get the reader to see them all...on the other hand, he often does keep the stroy moving well, though his use of cliff hangers at the end of each chapter can start to wear thin at times.<br /><br />With that said, I cannot help now but get the next volume of this rather remarkable series.	2002-01-25

John Calvin has affected theologians for centuries - from whole denominations to great 20th century thinkers (e.g., Karl Barth).  For the english reader, this 2 volume set is essential to grasp this quite readable theologian; and Calvin's passion for theology is not lost in this edition.  The books are very well footnoted, despite the somewhat dated referenced to theologians in the 40s and 50s.<br /><br />As someone who grew up in the Calvinist tradition, I felt it important to actually read the Institutes for myself and was surprised to discover things that many Reformed church do not emphasize - not to imply that its a good thing.  For example, did you know that Calvin said that evil is also God's will?  That, although carried out by Satan, evil is still directed by God? While many may accept the sovereignty of God, such extrapolations may be unsettling.  And I think being unsettled is a good thing when doing theology.  It makes you think about what you think.<br /><br />Again, you may love him or hate him, but you must read him!	2002-01-18

From orthodox readings by Justin Martyr to questionable documents as The Gospel of Thomas, the reader will find a great source of information.<br /><br />The book is best done in a class setting, and even tells you how to write a historiographical essay.

The Dragonbone Chair was an okay piece of fantasy for its genre, and, for what its worth, he makes here a good venture into science fiction.  Given the pervasiveness of the Internet, who knows where it will lead in the next decade, and this book could perhaps be thought of as prophetic in some ways.<br /><br />Nonetheless, in 800 pages, Williams really does not tell an 800-page story.  With meandering plots that ramble on to the point of almost babbling at times, he could have tightened the story and made a much better book.  Indeed, it is a good story, but it just never seems to end...even at the end, where I now see there are three other books that carry the story on.  Will it end?  Should it have even started?<br /><br />This is not to say I did not enjoy reading it, I was just left with a vague feeling of dissatisfaction.  The reader is made to feel he or she is reading the script for a TV series that never ends (a la X-Files) rather than a book.  And I doubt this will be on the little screen anytime soon.	2002-01-06

The tangled web that surrounds the life of a wretched and sometimes-wicked old lady is startling and the reader is anxious to know who the killer is - if even there is one.<br /><br />It is good to read a non-American novel, with good British prose amidst the culture of small-town nosiness.  With a mixture of homour and horror, Walters writes a good tale that gives credence to her fame as a world-class mystery writer.	2001-12-19

It has been a while since I have been able to sit down and just enjoy some good 'ol legal fiction - nothing heavy, nothing outrageous, just a good story.  It was a pleasure to spend long hours reading this book and trying to figure out at first who really was guilty, who really did commit these murders.<br /><br />The book builds up rather nicely to a somewhat predictable though still suspenseful (can this both be true?) climax that puts the book at a level that often surpasses that of John Grisham types.  There is a depth to the characters that makes you root for them and want to keep on reading.  I am impressed with Lescroart's ability to present a believable court case - especially since he is not a lawyer.<br /><br />The actual facts are not entirely believable however.  Dooher is so nice, so caring and yet the dark side that eventually comes out is a bit too jolting to seem believable.  Perhaps that is the point, to make you think ANYONE could be a murderer.  Still, I felt slightly cheated.<br /><br />This is a good book to curl up with, however, and to want to finish right to the end.	2001-12-14

It is so often in many fields that one thinks that they can change the medium without affecting the message, but time and time again, this is proven false.<br /><br />Istead of trying to figure out what the church should &quot;do&quot; to make people come, churches must think about hwat the church should BE to witness to its Lord.  God's ways simply may not be &quot;efficient&quot;; the churhc is NOT a business.  It is a herald, a foretaste of God's Kingdom, and if that means being out of synch with a self-centred society, then so be it!<br /><br />Kenneson and Street make a bold, though sometimes rambling, work that will unfortunately not be read by the right people.

With that said, I have read enough of his books to appreciate that he can put out a good yarn that can keep the reader going.  Its good &quot;fluff&quot; reading, especially for someone on a lazy vacation.<br /><br />Nonetheless, he disappoints with The Brethren.  Agter several hundred pages, not much really happens.  Sure, its a bit of a funny story of how three judges bilk closeted and rich men out of millions...and siddenly they nab &quot;the big one&quot;, who also happens to be the up-and-coming president of the United States, who also happens to be a CIA puppet.  Its funny, but in a way that a long running joke starts to lose its lustre after a while.<br /><br />The ending is shocking - becuase it really fizzles to such an extent that it seems that Grisham was on some kind of deadline and could not think of anything better.  It is hardly clever (though I think he thinks it is) and simply disappoints.<br /><br />If you like Grisham, you won't like this.	2001-11-14

Yet again I have ventured intot the theologically flawed series of literary fluff called the &quot;Left Behind&quot; series. Once again, LaHaye hasthe one-dimensional characters moan on about how they wished they could have been saved earlier. His attempt to continue to strike fear into the reader who has not accepted Christ is becoming tiring.<br /><br />Its not that *I* don't accept Christ- I jsut don't accept the horribly flawed reading of Revelation that they give in this series.  Another repeated statement that is made is how amazing it can be that people did not take Revelation &quot;literally&quot;!  Well, if you read these books and can stomach it (the series Imean, not the Bible) you find that LaHaye is only *selectively* lieteral.  The horse of the apocalypse rides indeed, but there actually is no &quot;literal&quot; horse riding about - so in that case, LaHaye is willing to concede that is not literal.  Couple that witht the fact that the whole Rapture theology is barely over 100 years old, and it is not hard to question their hermeneutic.<br /><br />Yes, people say this is just &quot;fiction&quot; - but the authours don't, and so do many I have talked to who have read these books.  Which is really why I read them.  Before I can critique something, I need to give it a chance.  So I did.  And they are awful.	2001-11-14

He first describes much of the problems with current ecclesiological &quot;blueprints&quot;: People of God, Body of CHrist, etc., saying that they are all fine as blueprints, but all suffer from a dualist essence.  By using Balthazar's theodramatic horizon, he addresses the realities of a concrete chuch in a hypermodern and postmodern age.<br /><br />His section of plurality is a breath of fesh air, after having read the writings of peopel like Hick who really just want to force a totalizing system uponall religions, really rendering them incapable of making any truth claims without being branded as &quot;parocial&quot; or &quot;fundamentalist&quot;.  He exposes the ultimately liberal underpinnings of this view, which is really roots in another kind of tradition.<br /><br />The theodramatic horizon in name is new to me, but uts idea has been seen in authors such as Brian Walsh, who espouse seeing Christianity as havings its own &quot;metanarrative&quot; that must engage with faithfulness with other traditions.  This is not only honest ecclesiaology, but it addresses the reality of a sinful church that must be corrected, often from the outside.<br /><br />This is a must for anyone concerned about where the church is headed.<br /><br />Read and enjoy!	2001-11-14

Nonetheless, Keneally has clearly researched this issue with passion and a desire to tell the real story as a result of his interviews with the people involved.  He brings out the agonizing ambiguity of the man, Oscar Schindler, a man who can play his dangerous game of saving &quot;his&quot; Jews from the horrors that hang over their heads.<br /><br />The book is told by using several vignette's of the legend of Schindler.  As a researcher, Keneally is honest in admitting in part where some of the stories may be overblown or even not true, but that they carry with them the essence of this remarkable man, a man who was so devoted to the Schindlerjuden at the expense of his relationship with is wife.<br /><br />Writing in such a way is interesting in bringing all the disparate parts together.  Unfortunately, it also seems disjointed and hard to follow at times.  Even so, reading it is not easy.  Finding out the truth of the Holocaust is paramount to understanding the evil that men can do, but also the lengths to which some can go to fight that evil.<br /><br />Read and Enjoy!	2001-09-24

I read Left Behind and was appalled at the lack of Scriptural basis for the authors' view of eschatology. It is hard to find anything in this book that I don't find repugnant from a theological perspective. It talks of &quot;biblical tribulation saints&quot; when there is no such name in the Bible. The idea of a &quot;silent, semi-second coming&quot; of Jesus has no basis in the Bible. Moreover, Revelation is taken so literally that it is almost laughable.<br /><br />Of course, there are statements in the book that those who did not want to take Revelation literally were part of those Left Behind. So Jenkins and LaHaye seem to add a new theology to the creeds that makes someone a &quot;valid&quot; Christian. It is this view that is most offensive, as Christianity should survive or fall on the person of Christ, not the way that He returns! Of course, this places me, in their view, in the realm of those left behind.<br /><br />The way that the world so easily accept the views of Carpathia, the evil anti-Christ is completely unbelievable. And the idea of the &quot;Tribulation Force&quot; sounds like some idea out of a science fiction novel. It was mentioned earlier about how anti-Catholic this book is. And I agree. The corpulent, booze-drinking cardinal who becomes Pope in this book seems to be a charicature of how LaHaye and Jenkins see Catholics.<br /><br />And yet, I found myself strangely interested in reading this book to the end. Perhaps it is akin to people's macabre desire to slow down and stare at a car wreck, but if I put aside the anathema of the theology that they use (and how many times do I have to read about the characters bemoaning &quot;if only I believed earlier!&quot;) I had a good time reading this book jsut for the fun of it. And, to be honest, at least the plot did show the importance of trusting Christ, of having faith in God's love.<br />I wrestle with giving this book two stars instead of one, but I did find it marginally better than the first.

The richness of Bernieres' writing is deep and emotional without being maudlin. He captures the life of a small island, a paradise of simple life that has been raped by Fascism, Nazism and external violence that leaves its inhabitants both terrified and united.<br />There is little &quot;good&quot; v. &quot;evil&quot; people here, but rather the oppressive influences and the horrific necessities of war placed on people. It is a lesson in history and human nature that shocks and warms the heart. This is a hopelessly romantic novel, yet does not fall prey to the saccharine platitudes of a typical romance novel. As the people of Cephallonia suffer the indignities that are imposed on them, we find the meaning of love, friendship and family.<br />This book is heartwrenching and yet also heartwarming as Palagia lives a bewildering life of love and loss. The characters come to life and seem almost mythical in their beauty and horror.<br />While most of the book takes place over several months, the latter part joltingly jumps by decades and loses some of its appeal in trying to bring together a final scene, that, though touching, seems strained and somewhat contrived.

For example, I think he was unfair to label Barth as &quot;pessimistic&quot;; in fact, many say that Barth was a universalist since there is no possibility for ANY religions (Christianity included) to bring salvation to anyone.<br />It is clear that Dupuis has a desire to be deeply orthodox, yet be sensitive to the depth and beauty in other religions.  Indeed, he does accept that God is *somehow* working in other faiths too, but Jesus is somehow there. The problem is that on the on hand, Dupuis expresses an orthodox belief of Jesus' uniqueness, yet, in virtually the same breath, changes the definition of uniqueness as he continually tries to avoid the mistakes of exclusivism.  In doing so, it is not clear what the solution is.  He fully appreciates the pitfalls of relativistic pluralism (a la Hick) but does not want to see jesus' uniqueness in terms of historical finality.  In support of his statements, however, he also wrestles wonderfully with many biblical passages that make this topic equally less clear than many people think. &lt;This is a wonderful exploration of this issue, unparalleled in anything I have read.  And while I do not fully agree with his methods, I deeply respect his perspective.  For example, he likes to use the motif of the Trinity to see God working throughout history, through the Word, the Spirit and as God Himself.  What he ends up doing is coming dangerously close to modalism.  Even more, he uses a doctrine, formulated originally for one purpose (i.e., to address the Arian heresy) and applies it to history, perhaps a place where the Trinity answers the wrong questions.  That is, it maybe should not be used for this purpose.<br />Dupuis also wonderfully explores the writings of Hick, Knitter, D'Costa and Rahner, among many others, as well as Vatican II, to truly teach the depth of this issue.  For that I applaud him.ybe should not be used for this purpose. <br />Dupuis also wonderfully explores the writings of Hick, Knitter, D'Costa and Rahner, among many others, as well as Vatican II, to truly teach the depth of this issue.

Such is the assessment of Thomas Hibbs in &quot;Shows About Nothing&quot;.  In his inimitably prescient perspective, Hibbs sees this reflection of Nietschian thought especially predominant in the kind of entertainment that we watch.<br /><br />In a particularly rigourous way, we are shown how seemingly disparate films or TV shows exhibit ways that we have approached issues of Good and Evil, ultimately indicating our collective agreement that there is little meaning in either term; instead we are subjected to coincidences and the capricious desires of a dark God who often makes lilfe one great comedy of the absurd.  Hibbs shows the link between a movie like Pulp Fiction and Seinfeld, two sides of the same nihilistic coin.<br />The reader is left wondering where we will go next, once evil is merely and banal as goodness, and God is relegated to a being conspiring to make us unhappy and evil is always just around the corner.<br />At times Hibbs writes in a way that does not make his point clear.  It is not always obvious if he approves of the film or movie he is discussing; on the other hand, perhaps his very ambiguity is indicative of the very problem we face.<br />What is remarkable is that Hibbs cannot contain his clearly Christian perspective.  It is refreshing to see a Christian write a thoroughly engaging and scholarly analysis of where our culture is at.  With the death of God comes comic meaninglessness and quests for meanings that ultimately have no end.  He convinces us that we may indeed be Nietsche's last men.	2001-08-13

On the other hand, it is far from a classic, especially considering what Irving *can* do.<br />I found that the first half of the book was, as usual with Irving's writing style, engaging and kept my interest.  At times, I even found that I laughed aloud, especially at the antics of Dr. Zanjac and his poop-eating dog.  The more I read, however, the more frustrated I became that I felt that Irving took a good idea and *stretched* it into a mediocre plot.  Now, I must be fair and say that I cannot expect Irving to put out something as grand as Owen Meany.  Nonetheless, even his writing voice somehow seemed an order of magnitude more detached and lacking in passion than I found in other novels prior to Widow for a Year (an even worse book).<br />Patrick Wallingford, his sexual anarchy, and his mystical experiences with his hand seemed to be Irving's attempts to capture his earlier work, without the sense of conviction for which he is famous.  At times, it felt that he wrote the humorous antics in the book for their own sake, either without attaching to them greater meaning, or making them too contrived to fit the plot.<br />While The Fourth Hand is an utterly readable book, it is unfortunately also unmemorable.

Its not that I don't sympathize greatly with his points; indeed, the attack on the concept of family, the moral decay of society, etc. are discouraging at best and even frightening.<br /> Nonetheless, Blamires style, instead of coming off as a &quot;wise uncle&quot; as J.I. Packer says, he sounds like a grumpy old man.  Amidst some adequate attacks on the post-christain mind, Blamires fondly recalls the Victorian era, mourns the lack of using the King James Bible and the awful &quot;pop-music&quot; that pervades worship in the church today.  To him, these are &quot;given by God to English speaking people&quot;.  Indeed, I am often frustrated by the desire to &quot;modernize&quot; music merely for the sake of attracting youth.  But his simplification of what is happening here is far from accurate.  This is by no means the sole reason why, for example, some music is made to sound more modern.  Did he ever consider that the hymns he loves so dearly (again, as do I) were derived from &quot;popular&quot; tunes of the day?  Moreover, some were based on the tunes of bar-songs, but given religious music!  Moreover, those who started the writing of the King James Bible at the time were doing something very new and avant garde, precisely for the point of appealing to people who could not read the originals or Latin.  As a Reformer, does he no know that his beliefs come from a host of &quot;rebellious&quot; thinkers who turned the theological world upside-down?  Again, this is not to say that change for its own purpose is worthwhile; at the same time, change in itself is not always based on some &quot;post-Christian plot&quot; that Blamires so often makes it seem in this writing.<br />Aside from his anecdotal meandering and lack of point (I did not understand his point in the &quot;Compassion&quot; chapter, for example) the final issue I have with this book is that it is profoundly centred on morality without hardly mentioning the name of Christ!  Moreover, few biblical passages are referred to; instead, it comes off sounding like a yearning for &quot;the old times&quot; or, as Blamires refers to it so often, &quot;the times of our grandparents.&quot;  Let us not forget that, for many of us, the times of our grandparents were the times of the First and/or Second World Wars.

As usual, this does not appear to be a popular book, but how can it be in the age of the Left Behind series when the state of Israel is viewed as a part of God's grand plan to bring about the coming of the final end of time itself?<br />March sets up a good understanding of the theology of land, that all land is God's land, and that any land, whether Israel or otherwise, is entrusted to us for our loving stewardship.  In this way he reflects a solid Reformed view of earth-caring.<br />What March does not do is give a better understanding of the mistakes made my premillenialists and their fervor to see this as a fulfillment of prophecy.  While he denies that Israel IS a fulfillment of prophecy, and rightly so, this is not done with  solid rigorous argument that shows how to properly read the Bible.  Instead, he gives vague concepts of reading prophecy in a more &quot;spiritual&quot; way without tackling the mistake premillenialists make.  For such a work, I refer the reader to &quot;Hal Lindsey and Biblical Prophecy&quot; by C. Vanderwaal.  For THIS is the source of problems; any Christians support Israel qua Israel in its current political form as a fulfillment of the covenant with Abraham.  He does not explain where this is mistaken.<br />This book also quickly outdates himself, given the current climate.  His misplaced hope in the Oslo accords have failed now in the Year 2001 with Palestinians seeming to be ready for another major conflict.<br />I admire his start in this topic, but it needs more in depth treatment.  Again, I refer to another book, namely &quot;Anxious for Amegeddon&quot; by Don Wagner as being the best-informed book I have read on this topic.	2001-07-18

He clearly knows a great deal - more than I ever hope to! - yet it may be this very fact that made this book disappointing.  He knows a great deal, but it doesn't go as deep as it could.<br />It may be that McGrath has tackled a topic that is hopelessly broad.  After all, what is &quot;science&quot; and &quot;religion&quot;?  This book illustrates this problem in that he almost exclusively focuses on Christianity.  This is sufficient and worthy of a book, but the title is misleading: whenever he does address other religions, albeit obliquely, McGrath has little to say that is helpful.  Meanwhile, McGrath takes numerous interesting but meandering paths in this work that left me wondering exactly what his point was.<br />If I were to recommend this book, it is useful as a point of contact to move to other authors who have written more deeply on particular aspects of the interface between Christianity and science.  Perhaps that was his intent, and indeed he admits this is an introductory work.  Unfortunately it comes off seeming sloppy and unsatisfying, especially considering that McGrath is capable of so much more.<br />In addition, there were woefully numerous spelling errors, and even a page where the font changed!  I won't pin this on McGrath, but on the editors.  I will say, however, that his writing was at times awkward and imprecise.  I would have suggested he give it another read before publication.<br />In the end, this gets three stars for still being able to teach me something, but certainly not enough for me to consider McGrath to have made a significant contribution to the very significant issues of science and Christian faith.	2001-07-05

The hard part about rating this book is that Kurtzweil is on the one hand somewhat convincing while also being overly hopeful about the human condition.<br />Kurtzweil makes the prediction that by 2019, computers will exceed human memory capacity and mental cognition.  From there, he predicts that computers will essentially become better than human to the extent that we will have to become part of a world of cybernetic ubiquity.<br />Part of this, like many futurist claims, is going through the arguments of extrapolation based on past and current data.  Even Kurtzweil, however, admits that Moore's Law must end at one point and be taken over by some other form of technology.  We are reaching physical constraints of being able to fit only so many transistors on a chip.  You know that joke where the scientist is doing an equation on the board and then puts &quot;then a miracle happens&quot; to get to the next step?  Kutzweil does a bit of that here by outlining several possible-but-not-yet-viable technologies that are out there (quantum computers, DNA computers, etc.) and too often invokes the Law of Accelerating Returns as proof it must happen.  The fact remains that in order for his dates to be met, certain things have yet to be invented.<br />Nonetheless, he may not be wrong, and history DOES show a geometric increase in the abilities of machines.  His next jump is to state that eventually we will be able to download ourselves into a computer, into a virtual world.  We achieve whatever reality we want, we achieve immortality because we have escaped the shackles of the prison of our human bodies.  For those who know theological history, this is startlingly reminiscent of Gnosticism, without the religious overtones (though one could argue there is a good dose of scientific religion here).  All we are are disembodied pieces of software, just like &quot;spirit&quot;, which must be free of the physical.<br />Finally, Kurtzweil is clearly what some call a &quot;forward stampeder&quot;.  Yes, there are things that technology has done wrong, so we just need MORE of it to fix it!  In his sobering analysis of the Unabomber's Manifesto, Kurtsweil reaches a point of honesty by admitting that we are not guaranteed a rosy future.  His response however is &quot;we have the opportunity to shape technology, and to channel its direction&quot; (p. 186) Indeed, for only the next 18 years we do.  Then, if he is right, we will not have any control.<br />If Kurtzweil is right, the world could just as easily be like movies we see like Terminator, where we fight a losing war with the machines.  Or the dark future of The Matrix.  For me, I hope he is wrong, but am afraid he is not far off.ard stampeder&quot;.

This is what Christ came for - not to cause division over land, but to be the final fulfillment of all prophecy.<br /><br />And it is prophecy that is the very problem, says Don Wagner, and hence the reason for the title of this book.  Some say that God has blessed the Israelis in their ability to dominate over Arabs with such power (e.g., the six day war).  But such a view is not completely accurate if we also see how many Christians who are &quot;anxious for Armageddon&quot;, who want to &quot;force&quot; their view of biblical prophecy to occur, have been great supporters of the Israeli regime.  And a regime it is.  Palestinians to this day live in refugee camps and exist in a virtual apartheid.<br />The very prescient point of this book is not anti-Israeli, but an attack against pro-Rapture, dispensationalist Christians who use their skewed and incorrect view of prophecy to support the existence of Israel at all costs.  This is not to say that Israel must not exist, but should it at the expense of the lives of Palestinian families?<br />Wagner presents these arguments with passion and love.  It may be controversial, but it is hard to ignore.<br />Read and Enjoy!	2001-06-18

What he tries to make up for in creativity, however, he lacks in writing style, development and diction.  I have only read this book, the first of the five novels in the series, but it has done little to urge me to continue.<br />That does not mean I don't like Card's ideas; they are quite refreshing as he attempts to write a truly spiritual science fiction book.  Yet the concept of the Oversoul soon wore on me...and once I reached the end of The Memory of Earth, I was surprised, because in almost 300 pages, very little seemed to have happened.  For some books, this means that the author has taken his or her time to develop the plot; not in this case.<br />A part of me feels I am being hard on Card; if I could give an extra half-star star, I would, but the fact is that I have to measure up Card against his own writing.  And this book (I cannot speak yet of the series) just does not quite make the grade.	2001-06-05

The dearly loved chronicles of Narnia has always held a wonderful place in my heart, from the time it was read to me by my first grade teacher.  Each time I pass a wardrobe, I often wonder what mysteries are on the other side.  Will a faun lead me to a new and great adventure? And when I see I lion I think of the magnificence of Aslan with his piercing eyes and mighty roar.<br />For those who have not read this book, you must be ready for something that is more than just a beautiful story about children, the magical land of Narnia, a wicked witch, and an &quot;untamed Lion&quot; named Aslan, whose very name brings joy to the heart of all who hear it.  It is also an allegory of Christ and His Love for all, the Great Lion of Judah who is kind, loving, but, indeed, never a tame God!<br />I have spoken to people who have read this book as a child and did not know that this level was present in the books; that's ok, because you can read it again as an adult and see how Lewis, in his inimitable way, can beautifully weave a story of suffering and grace, loss and celebration.<br />For children, it is a book that will give them a love of reading, of imagination and joy.  For adults, it can teach us simple faith in our always-complex world.<br />Read and enjoy!	2001-06-05

Perhaps it is best to start with the positive.  As many people have said, the novel DOES keep a person reading.  It is written in a way that captures the reader's interest and is somewhat fast paced and easy to follow.<br />With that said, I cannot say enough in this space in my desire to dissuade people from reading this novel.  I particularly speak to Christians.  The theology and view of the bible is rife with error to the point that it is not worth addressing if this entire series were not so popular.  The Rapture theology was thankfully beginning to wane before this came out, and now it has a (hopefully) short resurgence of adherents.  If my belief was that the Rapture was bad theology before, this book only strengthened such belief in its use of Scripture out of context, its twisting of political events to fit &quot;prophecy&quot; and its unbelievable premises.  It is not only incorrect, it is dangerous as such a view has definite political overtones.<br />Again, I would not stoop so low to criticize this if it wasn't so popular AND if people did not make the claim I so often hear that it is &quot;just fiction&quot;.  If you find the transcript of Larry King interviewing the authors and even read the praises of readers on later editions of the book, you will find that this book was precisely written as a representation of what the authors see as essentially being what WILL happen.  So do not be fooled into believe their version of eschatology...and in so doing, do not be fooled into reading the book.	2001-05-28

Given that, therefore, although the Dark Elf trilogy is chronologically beofre the other books, I had this feeling I had to understand the importance of who Drizzt was in order to completely get into the books.  I suppose it is like the Star Wars prequel as well; the story means a little less if you did not know that Anakin would eventually be Darth Vader.  Here, too, I found the story interesting but losing something because I have no concept of what this drow would become (had become?) in future (past?) novels.<br />While many of the scenes in this novel are filled with excitement, action and suspense, when you read the entire trilogy at once, the repetitive pattern (shall I say formula?) that Salvatore follows becomes tedious and monotonous.  I eventually found thinking sarcastically &quot;Oh no, how ever will Drizzt get out of THIS hairy predicament?!&quot;  Drizzt's luck and improbable actions scenes make the novel seem somewhat hyperbolic at times.<br />This is not to say that Salvatore has not written quite a lively and entertaining series.  There are a lot worse fantasy books out there and I appreciated the well-planned development of the life of the drow.  With all sorts of remarkable creatures and humourous interludes, the novel does the job of being interesting while unfortunately also not being very impressive.	2001-05-14

With his characteristic wit, humour, digression and depth, Robert Ferrar Capon has delivered another book centred about grace.  In his always inimitable way, Capon is able to present an old theme in a new way, using various writing styles and techniques to get his point across.<br />Having read &quot;From noon to Three&quot; and this book, clearly Capon wants to emphasize - no, pound into your head - the idea that God has done it all, that grace is free, that God simply does not see our sin anymore.  He must have quoted the verse &quot;there is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus&quot; and it is the entire world who is in Christ, and we are in Him.  This is part of the mystery.<br />As a pastoral tool Capon's perspective is refreshing and greatly needed in our works-loving, bookkeeping Church.  Capon writes like a prophet, warning us that we fall too easily into the danger of thinking we have to &quot;do&quot; something.  I also enjoyed his discussion of ways that we can view the resurrection.  This was an education and well thought-out section of the book.<br />Of course, I have a &quot;but&quot;....I was continually uncomfortable with Capon's approach which, while he claims is theological, often plays fast and loose with the Bible.  He was unconvincing in his analysis of the sheep and the goats parable.  Moreover, I did not appreciate his several jabs at Bonheoffer, nor his implication that the &quot;medieval&quot; theology of Luther and Calvin, qua medieval theology, was unacceptable.  Capon claims that, instead, he is more &quot;biblical&quot; - a term too often bandied about these days.<br />He speaks near the end of ways that our lives need to be, not acceptable to, but &quot;congruent&quot; to the mystery of Christ.  And this would seem to me to mean that congruent should be biblical, but no....instead it is okay to practice astrology as if it gave us even the &quot;weather&quot; of things.  Meanwhile the bible specifically indicates that it is not a godly practice.  How is it then congruent that his wife is a practicing professional astrologer?  No, I do not &quot;condemn&quot; her for it, only to question how he can make this claim.<br />Given that Luther has expounded so well on the grace of God, I think Capon takes it too far somehow and goes somewhere that is not warranted.  Now, if he read this, he would think that I was falling back into &quot;medieval&quot; or &quot;works&quot; theology.  No, I just am not convinced that what he argues is fully biblical.  It's not that I want grace to cost anything, just that I think he is not convincing.t it is not a godly practice.  How is it then congruent that his wife is a practicing professional astrologer?

It already has.  As a health care professional in the technology area, I have seen great strides (and blunders) in the area of computers and health care.<br />It is hard, however, to understand Burke and Weill's intent of writing this book.  It is thin and addresses the mere surface of each issue.  I suppose it is for people who are entirely computer illiterate - I mean, it describes what a keyboard is, what a mouse does, and a brief definition of the Internet.  If people don't already know about these then why explain health informatics and MRI scanners?  More information could have been put in the book if more knowledge had been assumed; if the health professional does not have this knowledge, then they need to take some more basic courses.  This book, in trying to start with the ultra-simple, then moving to the incredibly complex issue of digital imaging in just over 200 pages, it renders itself almost useless.<br />On a positive note, the chapter on computers in surgery was helpful and somewhat well done, given the meager space it was given.  The best aspect of the book was the darkened &quot;In the News&quot; sections.<br />I would suggest books on Health Informatics and Medical Imaging (after getting a hold on computer basics) rather than purchase this book.	2001-04-20

In my frustration and annoyance at the disturbing popularity of the Left Behind rags, I was interested in the many strong opinions I read on the Christ Clone Trilogy.  I had seen so many positive comments on BeauSeigneur's series that I wen tout and bought the first of the trilogy.<br />I must say, this is indeed the best end-times book I have read; however, seeing as how I have read so very little of them, this is not saying much.  The story was interesting, but not consistently.  I was gripped by the Shroud of Turin stuff and the neat theories behind the Ark of the Covenant...I love that stuff, so the beginning really had me.  But the book did not keep my interest; moreover there were some major issues that I had with the books.<br />First, the Clone himself.  I'm not a history revisionist by any stretch, but it seems to me that if Christ were cloned, then this person would look like a first century Jew - a darker skinned person.  Well, the Clone in this book was ablr to pass himself off as a white person (the nephew of a scientist) and was clearly thought to be of European stock!  While BeauSeigneur seemed to want to be as accurate as possible by all the &quot;footnotes&quot; he has (most of which were just Bible quotes), he was clearly lacking in this regard.<br />Second, I'll set aside the whole bad theology of the rapture; I'll rant about that elsewhere. Let's assume that it's good theology (which it isn't!). Now I was intrigued by BeauSeigneur's way of handling it - VERY different from other renderings of this event.  BUT - don't you think the world would have made a correlation between all the people who left in the &quot;Disaster&quot; with the fact that they were all Christian?  That was a major hole to me.  There was not even an attempt to pretend at a reason why all these people are gone - they just refer to it as the Disaster.<br />Third, I did not like the treatment of Jewish theology.  BeauSeigneur may be right that Jews are not allowed to predict the coming of the Messiah in Daniel, and perhaps they almost never read Isaiah 53, but I really doubt it.  In fact, I have read numerous sites on the Web where Jews have given their own perspective on this prophecy.  As a Christian, I may disagree with their translation, but I do not claim that they are as ignorant as BeauSeigneur implies.<br />These are the major problems that kept staring me in the face.  That's not to say it was not an interesting book.  I would like to read the rest of the series, but I don't really feel like paying for the other two books!  I will grant that BeauSeigneur delved into more speculative and fantastic ideas; I don't think that he sees this entirely as the way it WILL happen as the LEFT behind authors do.ct the coming of the Messiah in Daniel, and perhaps they almost never read Isaiah 53, but I really doubt it.

As author of the Star of Redemption he has given Jewish people much to think about.<br />Part of his story was that he originally was going to convert to Christianity as a result of a discussion he had with his friend Eugen Rosenstock.  However, after attending a Jewish holy day ceremony, he dove into his then minimal Jewish faith with great enthusiasm.  After that, he and Rosenstock exchanged letters that give a fascinating account of Rosensweig's ideas.  He has done some deep thinking with regard to how the Church and Jews can coexist, and how they can view each other.  He has appropriated &quot;the stubbornness of the Jews&quot; as a Jewish theology of pride in the eternal Jew who refuses to be bent by culture.  As a Christian, there is much for me to learn about how my own faith has often been co-opted by culture.<br />Sometimes this dialogue is hard to follow, but if you stay with it to the end, you are rewarded with some great nuggets of inspiration and thought.  And it is fascinating to see how Rosensweig has developed his thoughts.  A wonderful book for anyone who is serious about Jewish and Christina dialogue.<br />Unfortunately, as happens with many books I like, it is not in publication anymore.  Go to your local library.

Now an old old man at 30, I decided I wanted to once again delve into this &quot;children's&quot; novel that always gave me a strong memory of great beauty.<br />I was not disappointed; while ostensibly a children's novel, this book has concepts that will inspire wonder in even old cynics like myself.  For children and teens, this book can challenge them to imagine, to think of strange other worlds and the possibilities of other dimensions.  L'Engle is also sure to bring in a spiritual element to A Wrinkle in Time that is not preachy or inappropriate; it is in fact crucial to the plot.<br />Oh, I cannot resist wanting to compare it against the vapid, one-dimensional character of Harry Potter, or put it alongside the wonder and beauty of The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe.  To do so, is perhaps not only opinionated, but also unfair; A Wrinkle in Time stands on its own and is unique unto itself.

I bought this book for my airplane/vacation read as I went down south this spring break and it kept me reading.<br /> The thought of time travel never ceases to be a hot topic in the sci-fi world.  Authors are famous for cooking up new ways that this can be achieved and as a fan, I like that.  Chrichton has done a good job of doing this; the concepts he brought up on quantum science and the possibility of other worlds were convincing and actually made me do some research about it on the Internet.<br />With that said, Crichton still made one of those kind of action-packed books where the action implausibly continues non-stop.  People are experiencing such cliches as hanging by their hands from water wheels, finding near death from waterfalls, and having to get back to the &quot;present&quot; just in time or they will be stuck in the past.  The action scenes would probably make for an entertaining but not so original movie.  I am hoping that they won't try to do it.  After all, it was done already when it was called &quot;Back to the Future&quot;.<br />This book served its purpose in keeping me reading something light as I sat in the sun.

On the other hand, this does not say much for it as a book.<br />There is an interesting view of the future with the paranoid &quot;Gray Party&quot; seeking to control everything, the uncovering of a conspiracy and the cool gadgets that McCarthy comes up with.  At the same time, I felt like the world he created made the mistake that many SF writers do...there is too much &quot;Ooooh!Ahhh!&quot; expected by the way it is written.  It seems that it was to make us think it is all so neat.  Now, if only I hadn't seen that in dozens of other books out there, not to say bad science fiction movies.<br />While I found the plot interesting, especially when our hero must hide from the authorities who wield their weapons of technology (hmmm...didn't I see that in Blade Runner?) it was too contrived and to unbelievable.<br />In terms of his writing style, McCarthy does seem to know some technical terms, but he throws them around and mixes it with &quot;golly gee whiz&quot; dialogue that makes for abrupt reading.  His characters (especially Bowser) have some strange element about them that almost seems sinister - but I don't think he means them to have that.<br />It gets a three star because it did do the job *I* intended, but I doubt the job McCarthy intended.	2001-03-21

Even before Alias Grace, she has intrigued me by her eclectic writing abilities and captivating narration.<br />Now, this is not Alias Grace, her best work, and hence the 4 stars.  Nonetheless, I could not put this book down - and I have a lot of reading I have to get through!  Part history, part tragedy, part science fiction, this story has an &quot;epic&quot; nature to it as the story of Iris' tragic life unfolds.<br />This is a heavy book, leaving me with a sad feeling at the end; while there is some great witty humour in this book, you can see the ending coming like a rushing train, yet the impact is just as devastating emotionally.  During much of the book, one will wonder (unless you guess) why excerpts of this other book are in there, or, like me, you think they are in there for the wrong reason.  When the end does come, Atwood ties everything together quite snugly.<br />Which is perhaps my only criticism.  Aside from being a bit longish, I felt that, given some of the surprises at the end, the book was somewhat contrived.  Iris, the autobiographer of the story, deliberately leaves a major aspect of her life out, which of course is what tricks the reader at the end.  I am not sure if this is entirely credible, if Iris, as someone who wants to &quot;tell the real story&quot; as it were, would really do it this way.  You end up thinking it was Atwood's &quot;trick&quot; to make the story have a twist; and in so doing, it feels less like Iris' biography and more like the real author (Atwood) pulling the strings.<br />With that said, this does not detract from the reality that this is an excellent book, one of Atwood's best.<br />Read and enjoy!	2001-03-09

I agree that many today are blinded by the Protestant reality of Anglicanism, and that it owes a great deal to that movement.<br />Unfortunately, while Zahl does state he does not want to be &quot;anti-Catholic&quot;, he ends up being just that.  His greatest error is his broad-brush theological characterization of the difference between Protestant and Catholic, namely, that the latter is &quot;incarnational&quot; and the other is &quot;atonement&quot; based.  While there is some general truth to that, one may ask if both have merit, for he clearly has problems with the incarnational perspective.  By &quot;incarnational&quot;, Zahl refers specifically to the Orthodox (not even Catholic!) view of theosis.  If he wants to do that, then he needs to see how strongly catholic even Luther was and even reflected strong theosis sympathies, as shown by the Helsinki school of Lutheran study.  In the end, Zahl is simply being polemical at this point.<br />I agree, as an evangelical protestant Anglican, that Anglicanism is not a &quot;third way&quot;, but rather a Protestant faith with an Episcopal, historic model.  Nonetheless, there is ALSO a &quot;Catholic&quot; face to Angilcanism, whether he (or I!) like it or not.  Moreover, he uses &quot;Protestant&quot; and &quot;evangelical&quot; very loosely and I was often unclear what his definitions were.<br />In the end, the book captured my interest, but was thankfully short.  I got this feeling it was written by someone who was annoyed by Anglo-catholic elements in his denomination and wanted to write against them.  I also found the dearth of discussion around third world Anglicanism (a VERY protestant and evangelical movement!) to imply that England, and to a lesser extent, the US, was where one discussed &quot;Anglicanism&quot;.  This is a mistake.	2001-02-14

Admitting that by the very nature of our society, we cannot help but enter into dialogue with others.  People of other faiths now live right next to us, work with us, and worship within blocks of one another.  Geography no longer separates us.<br />And so, Lochhead argues that dialogue has now become an &quot;imperative&quot;.  I agree.  In order to be human, to relate with one another we must learn to talk with people of others faiths and cultures - even people without faith.  By setting up his dialogical rubric, Lochhead attempts to do so in a &quot;Barthain&quot; mode, in reference to Karl Barth.<br />I agree with Lochhead's assertion that there are communities which have either a hostile, isolationist, competitive or have a theory of partnership with other faiths.  What he does rather glibly is box people into these and, albeit respectfully, discredits them, urging for dialogue.  In the end, Lochhead pushes for &quot;dialogue for the sake of dialogue.&quot;<br />In a sense, Lochhead argues for Dialogue that is essentially without purpose other than itself.  Our &quot;intent&quot; should not be to witness, to convert, to even learn, but only to understand.  Moreover, Lochhead is able to make his case in redefining dialogue to be essentially equivalent to &quot;love&quot;, for in dialogue we follow Christ command to love our neighbor.  I would say this broadens the definition too much and makes dialogue too fuzzy.<br />When he addresses &quot;witnessing&quot;, he shows a dislike for having any attempt to &quot;proclaim&quot; Christ.  Once again, to try to be true to the biblical call to church mission, he then redefines what we are called to do as &quot;storytelling&quot;.  He does this briefly and it is not really clear how this is different than &quot;witnessing&quot;.<br />I am unclear how he is Barthian except in one area, namely, &quot;faithful agnosticism,&quot; meaning that we should be faithful to Christ, but not to make judgments about the validity of the faith of others.  I think there is some truth to that; but I do not think he remains entirely Barthian throughout the book.  In fact, I see much more of Tilich's influence in the need to let each tradition reflect on each other in dialogue so that both can be changed and to learn.<br />His final view on comparing dialogue to the two natures of Christ is a stretch for me and a way to somehow stick to his theory while allowing for a high Christology.  It does not follow that he also remains biblical and true to the narrative (i.e., story).<br />I recommend this book (if you can find it!), but to be aware of the flaws.meaning that we should be faithful to Christ, but not to make judgments about the validity of the faith of others.

Calling the Pope the antichrist, and the Roman Curia a den of evildoers are not comments that are going to curry a great deal of favour from Rome.<br />Perhaps it was Luthers passion that served as a detriment to his ability to dialogue productively with the theologians of his day.  Equally possible is the intransigence of those with whom he argued.  I think it was somewhere in between.<br />Therefore, it has taken some years for Catholics to take a look at Luther, to bypass his anti-Catholic sentiments (sentiments which remain in many Protestant quarters) and to delve into his theology.  Using Luther's own words, Wicks makes a good attempt to examine what Luther has to say about salvation, works and God's gift of righteousness through Christ.  Taking an historical approach, we see Luther moving from his famous and more mystical &quot;theology of the cross&quot; to his reformational decisions, to more mature writings on grace.<br />While this is a good start from an &quot;outsider&quot;, I would have liked to see a more critical review of Luther's work.  Aside from some initial comments in the introduction, I think it would be helpful to have Wicks dialogue more with the text as a Jesuit, rather than simply present what Luther has to say.  It may be that his intention was to write for fellow Catholics (which is very likely), but I found this book less helpful for someone like myself who is studying Luther and already reading similar Protestant writings.<br />From an ecumenical perspective, this is a remarkable work.  I am eager to see more of this occur between Catholics and Protestants.	2001-01-22

Small as its structure appears to be, it feeds and fosters great minds, minds which can develop deep and applicable Christian philosophy.  This compendium tackles philosophy in the post-modern world, unashamedly proclaiming faith as the centre of philosophy.<br />Coming from a generally a Reformed, and particularly, a Dooyweerdian perspective, these essays delve into areas that traditional philosophy often hesitates to tread.  In doing so, however, by grasping at the advantages of proclaiming truth within a community that postmoderity allows, Olthius has brought together great minds for a great read.<br /> This is not an easy work, especially for those who are not at least somewhat familiar with philosophy.  And those who do not subscribe to Christianity may find this attempt brazenly subjective.  I think that this is the point.  For once, THESE philosophers admit to subjectivity as such.  There is no such thing as objectivity.<br /> Read, think and Enjoy!	2001-01-03

Simmons is a top-notch author who was able to weave six equally exciting and captivating stories into this epic novel.  I only finished Hyperion last night and want to get the next one to discover the mystery of the Shrike and the Time Tombs.<br />Simmons uses a mixture of horror, tragedy, poetry and action to tell a story of pilgrims on a journey to the Shrike.  He uses their stories to deal with faith, fatherhood, love, mystery and intrigue as the pilgrims go with hidden stories that eventually are told.  They also go as the human race begins its apparent decline into interstellar war and a total end to humanity itself.  Simmons ability to tell each tale with a different writing style highlights his ability to be both captivating and eclectic.<br />I eagerly await the continuation of this novel to see where he is leading.  This story is complex and leaves a lot of questions unanswered.  I like that.  It makes me want more!<br /><br />Read and Enjoy!	2001-01-02

Dr. Pantinga has achieved several successes by publishing this excellent compendium of works by some of the most important theologians in the past 2000 years.<br />First, for myself, this book is a great introduction to some of the most important source literature of great men (and unfortunately they are all men) who have had an important impact on Christian thought throughout the ages.  Some perhaps would argue how GOOD such impacts have been, but it is good to understand where they come from.  As a person who has just started to read theology, I have wanted to read more deeply into the historical writings and to appreciate theological works such as these.<br />Second, Plantinga has also published a book which is an excellent starter to a discussion on plurality and how the Christian faith is to relate to other beliefs.  I am reading this before I am taking a course called &quot;Christ Among the Religions&quot;, and I think that, although this is an excellent book, it will perhaps be even better when some of the concepts are explained and unpacked.  You cannot read this book lightly and, I know for myself, I can't read it without a bit of help and discussion with others.  I know this book will be a great source for much vigorous talk!<br />How refreshing to see a book such as this be published.  It is of great scholarly value - but not only for ivory tower theologians, for plurality is a concept that all serious Christians must deal with.<br /><br /> Read and Enjoy!	2000-12-20

I have heard of him and his unusual approach to theological ethics and I thought I'd read this book as my professor recommended it to me.<br />I was startled to find that he had a whole new way of looking at things that I never really quite thought of as lucidly as he and Willimon have.  Not only does he highly criticize the church for continually buying in to a Constantinian view of the church, he even critiques such great Theologians as Neibuhr!  When someone does that, they either are supremely misinformed or have something very thoughtful to say, and, indeed this book does the latter.<br />Resident Aliens will make you see the church in a whole new light.  Members of congregations and pastors alike must read this book as I think it would impact you ministry for God more than any other &quot;seeker friendly&quot; or &quot;purpose-driven&quot; book could possibly do.  It particularly is a book that both uplifts and criticized the role of a pastor in a church.<br />While often bleak, Hauerwas and Willimon are brutally honest in the church impotence in BEING the church and instead has often simply become little different than a club where people come to get their &quot;needs&quot; met.  The colony image, while not perfect, is challenging as it highlights our need to care for one another, to be, as Rodney Clapp says, &quot;A Peculiar People&quot;, and to have our ethics driven by a biblical community, not a national idea of &quot;rights&quot; and &quot;liberties&quot;.<br />If I could suggest a book to read for Christians this year, this would be it!  Unfortunately, this book has been out for years and I do not see that it has had the impact that it should have.  When the full weight of the reality of the post-Christian society we live in in the West hits us, books like this will be our saving grace.  Either that, or we compromise until we become indistinguishable from the people around us.	2000-12-13

I am a science fiction fan, but alas, I find that I read sci-fi because, given the quality of a lot of the books out there, it is often an exercise in &quot;escapism&quot; from reading more &quot;serious&quot; books.  I regret to say that Ender's Game was not quite so bad as that, yet not a book that challenged me to think very hard.<br />Not so for Speaker of the Dead.  Card uses Ender's Game as a backdrop to a captivating novel that explores issues of guilt, love, relationships, and suggests possible modes of interaction between humans and a theoretical alien species.  In writing a &quot;futurist&quot; book, Card ingeniously touches on colonialism, religious power and cultural, if not physical, genocide - themes that are historic in the human story.<br />This creative novel turns Ender's Game upside down and surprisingly makes Ender the cultural bad guy after his heroic victory at the end of Ender's Game.  Yet it is entirely believable that Ender would be viewed as a monster rather than a hero, once given sufficient time for people to think about it and look at it from a different perspective.  And Ender Wiggins must endure hatred as he attempts to redeem himself through the enigmatic piggies.  Amidst this complex plot, Card is also able to weave a mystery surrounding the piggies that makes the reader want to read right to the very end.<br />And so, this is where science fiction should be.  It is science fiction at its best and so rare in this genre.  I like it when I need to use my brain and I resolve to read more of Card's novels.<br /> Read and Enjoy!	2000-12-08

I have been plugging away at the book and his exercises are clear, very helpful and a great tool to build ont he knowledge of previous work.  He also has exams and tests that continue to challenge the student.<br />This answer key is essential tot he book.  I would not seriously attackt he problems without it becuase I do not want to think I have done something correctly and continue on that track without knowing if I am not understanding a concept.  So, you have to have the answers to the exercises.<br />Unfortuantely, for this very reason, Mansoor, instead of making this a separate book, should have included it in the back of his book.  Of course, for those students who may be using the book for class may not have such an idea supported by their professor.  So I think perhaps it would be better if there was a self-learning book where the book and the answer key were included.  This is a major deficiency because this key is so essential.	2000-11-22

Bradley is able to conjure up wonderful characters and to build upon them and make them come alive.  The land of Avalon and its mystical beauty and the sadness of its disappearing weave a tale that is captivating and enjoyable.<br />I love the stories of Arthur I have read and telling it from the perspective of women does nothing to diminish its beauty and power and mythical quality.  Clearly Bradley has done a LOT of research and was able to work into the story some of the real myths that have been told of the Arthurian legend.<br />As a Christian myself, I must say that there is one negative to the story.  As much as I like it for what it was, this is a clearly anti-Christian book.  I don't say this lightly or often, but Bradley consistently makes all Christians in the book fanatical, uncaring, manipulative, intolerant or all traits combined.  I can think of no positive Christian character in the book - meaning someone who WANTS to claim a Christian faith.  Arthur claims Christianity, but when he does, he is not painted as a very likeable guy.  I think Mists has a major flaw in this respect.  Bradley takes a pseudo-religion (meaning, part real and part her creation) religion of the Goddess and challenges Christianity - a real faith - with it.  I find this uncomfortable and unfair.<br />With that said, I was still riveted to the story.  Bradely is a very gifted author who is one of the best fantasy narrators around.  Even with my discomfort, I recommend this book to anyone.	2000-11-20

Meanwhile, Hal Lindsey decades after the Late Great Planet Earth is still flourishing as a fear-mongering millionaire.  The Christian faith needs more authors who can incisively analyze people's work such as that of Lindsey.<br />What is great about Vanderwaal is that he does much more than give an intelligent critique of Hal Lindsey; he also helps the reader develop a proper understanding of biblical prophecy.  He uses clear, understandable language that is refreshing in the evangelical world which seems to want ear candy.  This is good theological work for a good reason.<br />Lindsey is one of the many authors who make grave errors in their approach to biblical prophecy.  Perhaps it is not fair for Vanderwaal to focus especially on him; on the other hand, Lindsey affected a whole generation with his unfounded and inaccurate predictions.  Vanderwaal is quick and effective to point these out.<br />If you wish to read Hal Lindsey, then read this first to give yourself a balanced perspective.  Vanderwaal is opinionated and holds fast to his critique.  But much of what he says rings true.	2000-11-15

His opening sentenace says it all: &quot;The scandal of the evangelical mind is that there is no evangelical mind&quot;.  True, harsh words, but Noll was able to put into words so much of what bothers me about evangelical Christianity.  From creationism to dispensationalism I have been frustrated by the lack of deep thinking within Christian circles and often I find myself branded as a cynic for asking too many questions. <br />The Scandal of the Evangelical Mind does not quite drift into the territory of criticizing BEING an evangelical, only that somewhere along the way, we have let ourselves be co-opted by thinking patterns that stifle good thought processes.  Noll deftly traces some of the history and development of the evangelical mind thorough the past few hundred years. <br />I would say that this book changed my life.  It helped me to realize much of what bothers me about evangelicalism.  It ALMOST made me want to give it up.  And some may say that this is the danger of the book.  However, I think that Noll does not want us to go that far; he honestly described the problems and begins to offer a solution to the way that we have forgotten how to love God with our minds. <br />I commend this to all who want to think honestly about their faith and not be afraid to be shaken.	2000-11-14

His genius imbues all his writing - this most of all.  With a wonderful narrative told from three characters perspectives, he weaves a story of the banality of academia (it reminded me of Umberto Eco's Foucault's Pendulum in this manner) along with characters that are both lovable and disgusting somehow.<br />Except for Maria.  She is the beauty of the story, the woman who must endure the silly old academic men, but who herself needs to learn about who she is and to find her identity in the midst of insanity.  Davies does not fully create a completely believeable female character in my opinion, but he comes close.<br />His humour is unmatched. Davies writes with a biting wit that cuts with razor sharpness. He uses an ironic narrative that will always not only make one laugh, but laugh thoughtfully. He makes us think of life and love.  You can't help but be made to think.<br />This is one of Davies best, from one of the best writers Canada has ever produced.<br />Read and Enjoy!	2000-11-10

I too struggle with this feeling as I read the great theologians who are out there. Not that I know more; its just that sometimes I think I do!<br />His warning and advice, then, comes as a stern but loving warning to be careful and wary. For os it not more important that we be people who help the people of God, rather than divide because of our elitist attitude? Thielicke perhaps not only is writing this to the &quot;young&quot; theologians who read it, but to himself, a man who is steeped in so much knowledge.<br />An essential and edifying book for all.

I am pleased to see that he and Robert Banks have got together to share this knowledge with believers in the massive compendium of interesting articles.<br />More than just a series of issues the authors want to speak on, they have brought many well known Christians together to write on everything from politics to masturbation, technology to rest, and celebration to even chocolate!  Some of the topics are done somewhat tongue in cheek, but they help a Christian understand that the Christian life is to be lived in everything around them, that it applies to all aspects of life.<br />This is a great reference book for those who are leading Bible studies, asked to comment on something or who have their own questions about certain issues.  It is helpful to get a person's though processes going.<br />Of course, the problem with this is that, though huge, it cannot hope to be exhaustive.  Moreover, in doing as much as it has, it rarely explores an issue in depth.  Its intent, though, I think was met: it helps the Christian to see that Christ is truly Lord of ALL.	2000-11-10

The reader becomes relived when we can appreciate that in fact there are many good things to which we may bid farewell in modernity.  The concept of the autonomous, objective self is replaced by cultural and worldview lenses.  Here is where Walsh and Middleton are strongest and where this is in many ways a continuation of The Transforming Vision - they employ the concept of the &quot;Wordview&quot; to show that Christianity is also one among many worldviews.<br />How this worldview is enacted in culture is the second part of the book.  Ultimately, it is not just a &quot;view&quot; but a perspective that is told through stories - narratives.  The Christian story is a narrative through which we continue to live out.<br />This is where the more dubious idea of the &quot;biblical metanarrative&quot; is described in the book. Postmodernity is precisely a rejection of ANY metanarrative, particularly the modern metanarrative of the objective, autonomous human who can manipulate nature and know truth objectively.  And it is a metanarrative that has often co-opted Christian faith over the past few hundred years.  While Walsh and Middleton acknowledge that this is true, they nonetheless make a case that the best way to express the Christian faith is to live out the biblical metanarrative of the faith in our culture.  I find their argument that a maetanarrative can be proclamed as normative to not be entirely convincing.  They argue that by its nature of being an inclusive, non-human centred narrative that it can appeal to the postmodern mind.  I do not see how this is going to be convincing as a normative claim.<br />With that said, it is one of the better books to wrestle with the philosophies of our age.  And I applaud them for it.said, it is one of the better books to wrestle with the philosophies of our age.  And I applaud them for it.	2000-11-02

In Biblical times, it was golden calves and great phaoroahs.  Today it is money, power, technology.  His quotation from the Psalms that we become like the idols we worship is so applicable and so true.<br />Bob Goudzwaard is an excellent, lucid and erudite author who speaks to the heart of this matter.  His captivating manner makes this book an easy, though disturbing read.  It made me realize how easy it is to be co-opted by our culture that makes power and money the absolute.  What is more frighteneing is that it is the subtlety by which this is done.	2000-11-02

By saying he uses the same themes, I do not mean to say this in a derogatory sense; I read Irving because I love how he toys with faith, love, and sexuality in a way that is always unique.<br />This time, Irving adds a wonderful plot of mystery and intrigue that keeps one wondering throughout the novel.  In the meantime, he tells a story of the low, the poor, the opressed and the unloved.  It does not paint a great picture of India, but it certainly does give an interesting one.<br />As the mystery unfolds, Dr. Daruwalla cintinues to try to come to grips with who he is and his own identity.  What is home?  How do we know who we are?  These are essential questions that in some way are not ever fully answered.  We can identify with his desire to help people who need help, knowing that there are millions upon millions of others who also need the same help.<br />This is one of Irving's best novels to date and is deserving of the accolades it has received.	2000-11-01

I bought it several years ago and it was a wonderful learning experience to read it.  It does not simply show how Islam is &quot;wrong&quot;, but it is written froma  Christian perspective, so it does effectively compare and contrast these two major faiths.<br />Beginning with some simple facts about Islam's beliefs and practices, it moves into various ways that an Christian can effectively dialogue and witness to Muslims.  There is an emphasis placed on understanding where they come from and how to reach them on their turf.<br />There are so few well balanced books on Islam and we needws more books like these!	2000-10-31

He attacks the hubris with which scholars (or, those who refer to themselves as such) wield the mighty tool of the historical method of determining what is real, not just about the man, Jesus, but the foundations of the Christian faith. For faith it is: a belief based on a religious language and hermeneutic, in the same vain as the Gospel narratives. The title of the book is apt, not only because it reflects a similar sensationalism that those of the Jesus Seminar use with their literature. It is clearly tongue-in-cheek, for he is emphatic that there is a distinction between the sum of probabilities of historical events and &quot;knowing&quot; what is &quot;real&quot; about Jesus. In the end, he does not write about how the historical records or the events portrayed in these records tell us about the &quot;real&quot; Jesus, but how they in fact cannot one way or another. Jesus is a Jesus of faith, directed by the records, but having been brought alive through the presence of the &quot;real&quot; Jesus who works through Christianity today.<br />What so few people understand (including JS scholars, if I may use that term) is that the biblical text is ONLY text and not the Bible unless read within a community of faith.  This is basic theology.  Without faith, you can tear apart the text and force out parts of it you don't want.<br />Johnson sets the record straight on the use of scholarship, obliquely (or, perhaps overtly) scoffing at the attempt of the Jesus Seminar to assume that what is scholarly is what is true and, moreover, far-reaching enough to make statements on the validity of religious claims. There is no doubt that as a believer in the traditional Jesus as espoused by the creeds, Johnson is biased. His genius is in showing that this also can be most emphatically said about the interests of the participants of the Jesus Seminar.sus Seminar.	2000-10-31

Both Paul and Bonhoeffer are writing from the perspective of someone who is imprisoned, who is never sure when their life may end.  If fact, both are probably sure that life will end very soon.  So when they write, they are writing what is truly on their hearts, bringing to their reader exhortations that they hope to leave with them that will most strengthen their faith and respective communities.<br />This book talks about very simple things: singing together, living together, reading together.  It touches little on how to overcome politics or proper forms of leadership.  What he wants most is to make sure that, of all things, we learn how to be true brothers and sisters, which can ONLY be done through Christ.  Without him and His will, we can do nothing.  The Christocentric nature of his writing is alomost startling, yet, like Karl Barth, is essential to understanding Bonhoeffer.<br />I was most affected by the chapter about reading the Bible.  He refers to booklets (writeen by the Moravians in his time) that focus only on a few verses.  He challenges us to read whole chapters, whole books, of the entire Bible.  This is so very true today.  If we even take the time to read the Bible, we don't take part in the great narrative of God's grace, in Israel's crossing of the Red Sea, of thier crying out to God for help.  When God rebukes them, he also rebukes us.<br />Perhaps some aspects of the book are somewhat anachronistic.  The part about singing is a bit opinionated.  I understand his desire for true unison singing - that it captures the symbol of all God's people joining as one in Christ.  But singing also can reflect diversity, the diversity of the people in our congregation joined by the words but diverse in HOW it is sung.  That is how I see it.  And I find his rebuke of &quot;unmusical&quot; singers a little elitist.  What would he think of current contemporary music with instruments, a leading band, and multiple melodies?  On the one hand he DOES give us necessary pause for thought - we cannot succumb to the desire to be &quot;current&quot; while compromising the gospel; on the other hand I think he is a bit stuffy in his comments.<br />What makes this a classic is that it is not just a list of exhortations, but a THEOLOGICAL work, not a take on business models for the church, or sociological ana;yses.  It is a book steeped in Scripture and that is very good.What would he think of current contemporary music with instruments, a leading band, and multiple melodies?

He has made some very complicated ideas much more accessible than many authors.  He writes in a captivating way that is almost like reading a story than a textbook presenting ideas.<br />From the influence of Greek philosophy to the &quot;End of Christendom&quot;, he touches on many key ideas in a way that makes you want to read more.  He is clear and at times puts in a bit of his own opinion in an educated manner.<br />This is still just an introduction, since you cannot be comprehansive in so few pages.  But he brilliantly solves this problem by giving a very good bibliography at the end of each chapter.  Moreover, he has a basic and advanced bibliography for each which helps you decide how &quot;deep&quot; you want to get into a subject. It is unfortuante that some of the books are out of date.<br />I highly recommend this for any theological student.	2000-10-26

The Rabbit who yearns to be Real and whose love for the boy was unconditional is both imaginative and sad.  I cannot read this book without a lump coming to my throat and being transported to simpler days when the love of a toy was the greatest thing in the whole world.<br /><br />This is a book with an ending that is mixed, that touches on the ambiguity of life and loss.  But there is also hope of a new beginning.  And I think children can understand that and grow from it.<br />I cherish this book deeply.	2000-10-24

Nonetheless, I feel that finishing the book leaves me barely scratching the surface of the issue.<br />I was particularly disappointed with the pre-Socratics, Plato and Aristole's chapters as they are so important as foundational philosophies for everyone else to follow.  The ideas were summarized much too quickly and I did not feel that I really understood what Platonic thought really was.<br />Nonetheless, this is a useful text just to wet your appetite.  It is by no means sufficient.  The bibliographies at the end of each chapter are a great idea as they will likely be the best way to grasp more what each philosopher has to say.  So, as a reference, I would say this book does serve a purpose.	2000-10-23

Robertson Davies has sadly left our world.  And what we have is a wonderful corpus of literature that is imaginative, provacative and captivating.  Among his excellent writing, the Deptford trilogy is his very best.<br />Of the three, I would say that Fifth Business is the best book, an almost cartain influence upon John Irving's Prayer for Owen Meany.  At once, Davies weaves a tale of childhood and tragedy, mysticism and religion.  I was enthralled by each book.<br />Davies' wonderful ability to write trilogies that use the same characters, but from the different perspectives of his many characters is brilliant.  Here, we have three autonomous stories that intersect and overlap, but one could in fact read the trilogy in reverse order and still find that it coheres.<br />His humour is unmatched.  Davies writes with a biting wit that cuts with razor sharpness.  He uses an ironic narrative that will always not only make one laugh, but laugh thoughtfully.  He makes us think of life and love.<br />Davies was never appreciated as much as he should have been outside of Canada.  These books are timeless and worth being on anyone's shelf.	2000-10-23

And even if science does not allow us to do quite what Huxley suggests, there is more to what he is saying.<br />It is useful to consider the two types of dytopias that Huxley and George Orwell predicts.  The latter is one of totalitarianism, like a Soviet state, or a dictatorship.  Huxley predicts a society where everyone is lulled into believing they are ahppy, that they do not realize that they are being manipulated, directed, guided and herded like sheep.  All the while they are happy, accepting it.<br />Many argue that technology like television, the Internet, and many others are doing this today.  WE live under a subtle form of totalitarianism than Orwell predicted in 1984.  This is worth thinking about, reflecting on as we read this timeless book.	2000-10-23

As my theology professor says, this is a remarkable book, especially given that it is &quot;written by committee&quot;.  And it is quite a remarkable committee considering the huge variation in people who took part in writing this document.  Eastern Orthodox, catholic, Coptic, Baptist, Anglican, people from virtually all denominations took part in writing this book that comments on the particular features of the Nicene creed.<br /><br />This book goes even further by addressing some of the current challenges to some of the claims of the creed. In particular, they highlight the atheist's areguments of the theodicy of evil in the world and their problem with accepting the existence of a good God.  Moreover, they also sensitively address the gender specific nature of God used historically.<br />More than an ecumenical work, it is a great primer for someone begninning a theology course to understand some of the nuances of theology without it getting pedantic.	2000-10-23

Told through the voice of an older John, one cannot but feel the ache in his heart that he must endure for the rest of his life following Owen Meany's...well, you have to read the end of the book.<br />Irving has a unique writing style that both shocks and yet captivates.  The humour is unique and yet diffused with a sadness that almost confused me.  Should I laugh or cry?

I refuse to compare anything to Tolkien (which is in a class by itself) so I won't go there.<br />Thomas Covenant is the ultimate anti-hero, the man who does not want to care, the man who cannot break out of being a leper becuase that is who he is.  And yet, The Land draws him deeper into its spell while at the same time his self-hatred grows.  The sadness of the giants and their love is overwhelming.  The integrity of Mhoram.  There is so much here to captivate the mind.<br />This is one of the only books I can think of where I truly wept with joy and sadness at the end of the last book of the first trilogy.  The beauty of Covenant's final ability to love the land and to truly want to save it is heartbreaking.<br />Donaldson has a unique and highly imaginative way of writing that both captivates and disturbs at the same time.  The characters he creates are beautiful and complex, the world he describes is one full of beauty and life.<br />I cannot commend this series to you more.  As a final comment, the Second Chronicles series is also excellent, but not quite as captivating and seems to try to hard to play off the greatnes of the first series.	2000-10-19

Or a Jesus that can be so shocking and controvertial that they can sell their books.  I suppose, in the end, that makes them comfortable too!<br /><br />Yancey bypasses such attempts and truly tries to re-examine our conceptions of Jesus but does not stray fromthe historical faith.  The Jesus he describes sticks to the biblical canon - source that is powerful enough to make us squirm.  For this Jesus that he uncovers is by no means easy to understand.  He is a complex figure, yet still Lord and still knowable.  There is unease and comfort at the same time in this.<br />At times, a part of me wishes that Yancey would address some of the challenges to the orthodox Jesus (e.g., The Jesus Seminar), but perhaps he is wise not to.  His writing at times can be a bit flowery and melodramatic, but it did not stop me from reading it twice anyway!<br />I can only bewail the fact that this is a rarity in Christian writing.	2000-10-19

Nonetheless, this is a well-thought response to Bucaille's attack on Christianity, for that is indeed what it is.<br />As a result, however, this really means that Dr. Campbell, well meaning as he is, also can appear to be attacking Islam.  My reading of the book does not say so, but i can see where Muslims can think this.<br />The problem is actually highlighted in Dr. Campbell's book - both sides have a different perspective, so their approach comes with certain base assumptions.  My many dealings with Muslims have shown that they simnply will not allow the same amount of textual criticism that they feel they can heap upon the Bible.  Moreover, Muslim critics use highly outdated, enlightenment approaches to the Bible - methods that few reputable biblical scholars see as valid.<br />This book, unfortunately uses the same techniques to sling mud right back as Muslims.  It is good forChristians to learn some things about the Qu'ran, but its method is simply no better than Bucaille's, even though I may agree with Dr. Campbell's conclusions.	2000-10-19

I objectively took at look at what he has to say and thought through his challenges.  Here is what the facts are:<br />1. In public debates he is simply insulting to the person he is debating and the Christians who are there.  Is this the type of person who you want representing Islam?  Is this loving and respectful?  Even muslims I know admit that he is &quot;not for Christians&quot; to hear, but for Muslims because of how rude he can be.<br />2. He is NOT a Biblical scholar as he claims.  He is skilled not a understanding the Bible, but at twisting what it has to say to fit his own purposes.  He does not understand the Christian doctrine of revelation and heaps insults at the bible.<br />3. He is inconsitent in his arguments.  Is it &quot;objective&quot; to only accept everything in the Bible that agrees with the Qu'ran?  If he quotes Scripture,as he tries to do, he refuses to look at the context of any of the passages, or any other passages that give it a meaning that is more along the lines of biblical thought.  I admit, even Christians do this, but true scholars point out when Christians make that mistake.<br />3. Therefore, &quot;Was Jesus Crucified&quot; is only answered in light of the Qu'ran.  And his logic does not even match basic Islamic belief except for the refusal to accept that Jesus died. For example, he takes the &quot;swoon&quot; theory where Jesus SEEMED to die.  This is the same belief if the heretical islamic sects, the Ahmadiyas.<br />4. He, like much is Islam, uses strongly Platonic and not biblical arguments.  Islam is rife with Platonism, not the God of the Bible.  His argument that if Jesus was resurrected, that he would only have a &quot;spiritual&quot; body is flwaed, becuase he never admits this is an ASSUMPTION. But Christians have never believed that the resurrected body is some fint &quot;spiritual&quot; body, but rather a whole body.<br />Deedat is far from a biblical scholar.

May I also quote Dietrich Bonhoeffer from Life Together: &quot;God hates visionary dreaming; it makes the dreamer proud and pretentious...God has bound us together in one body...long before we entered into common life with them, we enter into that common life not as demanders but as thankful recipients.&quot;  WE do not make the vision for the church - we enter into God's vision.<br />I should address my claim in my title that he is deceivingly unbiblical.  While reading the book, especially in the &quot;Vision&quot; section, I noted how many different translations he had to employ as he quoted Scripture to try and show the use of the word &quot;vision&quot; in the texts.  Moreover, many of these verses really do not refer to a &quot;vision statement&quot; which he implied, but a vision of taking part in God's vision for the world.  In this way, Warren instead uses biblical text to support a vision statement approach that is in fact directly copied from taht of large corporations.<br />Some of the ideas in this book are also very questionable.  For example, he insists that the pastor should be there a long time, that he or she is the essential Sheppard of the flock.  As a protestant who believes strongly in the priesthood of all believers, how can this be?  Is it about getting a single charismatic leader that we all rely on?  What happens when the person eventually DOES leave (death, goes somewhere else, etc.)  If the church is not strong enough in its own lay leadership, then this is a truly unhealthy church based on a cult of personality.<br /> Finally, the concept of growth is a slippery one.  Warren is admittedly careful not to say that this is what it is all about, but he says that if you are healthy you will grow.  I want to echo a fellow Amazon reviewer who commented that the more hard truths Jesus spoke, the more people left! Let us not forget that sometimes the gospel is offensive to the world!<br />On a personal level, it is hard to read this book.  It is what I call an &quot;exclamation mark&quot; book, meaning it seems that almost every page has 2 or 3 exclamation marks and almost flippant comments without a lot of deep thought.  Its writing style puts me off and makes me feel like I am reading a pop book and not a spiritual book.<br />This is not to say that he did not make me think or that he did not challenge me to rethink my current view of the church.  However, in comparison to Bonheoffer, I must say I have learned more from the latter.ventually DOES leave (death, goes somewhere else, etc.)  If the church is not strong enough in its own lay leadership, then this is a truly unhealthy church based on a cult of personality. <br /> Finally, the concept of growth is a slippery one.

After reading the book, I began to understand his obsession and even (I admit with embarrassment) began to take part in the fun.<br /> Horby's portrayal of Rob (frighteningly my own namesake!) seemed just a bit too familir to me.  Not just because it reminded me of me, but so many other of my friends.  The book IS funny, yet tinged with a sadness too.  It was pathetic sad, and yes, funny too when Rob went to visit all his past girlfriends to find out what went wrong.  This brand of dark humour perhaps was too much for me - at times I almost found the novel humourously bleak.<br />Nonethless, Horby succeeds in creating orginal, funny, and , unfortunately, believable characters.  A highly recommended book.	2000-10-18

Nontheless, the stories are a great break from the drudgery of life.  jordan can create a world full of great imagination and a captivating plot.<br />The characters are somewhat one-dimensional and at times the love story with Kahlan ventures into melodrama.  I dont mind a good love story, but it gets a bit much sometimes.<br />This is not really an epic, nor is it a classic, but it is one of the better fantasy series out there.  Goodkind should really end it sometime though.	2000-10-18

Dostoyevsky put a part of his soul into this book and gives us one of the very best novels of all time.<br />Indeed, it can be hard slogging at times; Russian culture comes very much into play in many parts of the book and it is good to buy a version where these aspects are explained.  It filles out much of what Dostoyevsky is trying to say.  For this is more than a story- it is an epic that seeks to speak much about the nature of the human condition, of society and of God.<br />On this latter point, Dostoyevsky'd brilliant wade into theological questioning, into the theodicy of God and evil makes for haunting reading.  who can answer Ivan's question as to how a small child can go through excruciating suffering and justify it by a heaven to come?  Is this the God we worship?  What tough questions tha leave me thinking long after reading it!<br />I think Dostoyevsky goes beyond his own desires to write about, as he put it, his hero &quot;Alyosha&quot;.  Indeed Alyosha is an interesting character -yet perhaps the character with whom at least I can identify the least.  His purity and goodness are too incongruous with my own life.  Perhaps it is that very nature of his character that Dostoyevsky, the addicted gambler, valued.<br />Much has been said about this novel and it can never be enough.  You have not read the greatest of literature until you have read The Brother Karamazov.	2000-10-18

So it is his best horror.<br />Yet I have never seen this is truly a horror book.  Cujo, The Shining, Christine, Carrie - those were horror.  There was an element of horror here and yet this book is not ABOUT that somehow.  The predominant theme in this book is friendship - the overpowering love that can exist between close friends.  This love never dies, it lives their whole lives.  King truly put a part of his soul into this book as he weaves a heartwrenching tale that leaves me still thinking about it 13 years after I have read it.	2000-10-18

I would recommend these books to any and all who ask.<br /> It is important to consider, however, when a sensation like this comes along - is this series truly a classic.  I define a classic as something deserving of the full five star rating.  It is at least clear to me that the fact that it is popular dies not warrant a 5-star rating.  Harlequins are popular, John Grisham is too.  But hardly are they classical works of literature.<br /> When I think of children's classics, I think of Roald Dahl's Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (or James and the Giant Peach) C.S.Lewis and Narnia and Madeleine L'Engle's A Wrinkle in Time.  Are the Harry Potter books comparable to these great works?  I must say that they are not, though they are a valiant effort.  Rowling has done a good thing for children's literature, even a great thing.  But not the very best.	2000-10-18

Some of these believe that this means that Christians interact best with their culture when completely removed from it; nonethless, this is stilla response.<br />The Neibuhr brothers have been essential in the early 20th century neo-conservative movement.  This book by Richard is no less importnat in modern theological development.  It categorizes various approaches to culture as Christian try to live out their faith in these divisive times.  Nonetheless, while it is not lacking in insight, it is somewhat too catagorical.  Christians do not neatly fit into these boxes, and sometimes drift from one to another.<br /> One category, for example, &quot;Christ Transforming Culture&quot; is problematic.  Most Christians view themselves as taking part in transforming culture.  Clearly this is Neibuhr's preferential approach to culture, but his definition is by no means the same as that of someone that he would classify as Christ Against culture.  To the ones of the latter category, is it not in the act itself of acting against culture (e.g., anti-war, anti-poverty) that we can truly transform it?<br /> Notwithstanding this critique, it is a good beginning to sociology and Christian thought.	2000-10-17

In fact, doubt is essential to faith and causes us a crisis which inevitably forces us to come face to face with who we are and what reality itself entails.  Dr. Clark takes onthe challenge of appealing to doubters, but also lending them hope and a reason to continue to believe.  His helpful, though cursory, study of Kierkegaard has opened my eyes to this philosopher and wants me to read more.  And an author that can make one want to read more has succeeded greatly.  This is a must-read for all Christians.	2000-10-17

He has written, in a very simple manner, ways that we can exercise our body and mind together to allow the Spirit to work in our lives.  It is not easy, but it is simple.<br /> Foster comes from a background where meditation and quiet reflection are essential element of CHristian praxis.  Our culture, however, has made things so fast, so noisy, so non-stop that exercising such muscles becomes an very difficult act.<br /> Some of the disciplines I never thought of as disciplines, such as worship or submission.  But Foster weaves a tapestry of exercises and practices taht can do nothing but bring us closer to God.  And that is the ultimate purpose.  The Disciplines are not useful in themselves, but only in the fruit they produce.<br /> Some of his medical claims are simply incorrect, however, For example, the white mucus in your mouth that may arise while fasting has nothing to do with the body cleansing itself, but rather the lower water content in your body.  Leaving these claims aside, however, his spiritual statements are sound and provocative.	2000-10-17

The inordinate amount of sex was surely a major aspect of my voracious reading of this series.  As I look back, 14 years later, I ralize that Piers Anthony had a gift of coming up with some great plots.  Yet he had to suffuse them with so much sex (and bad sex, may I say), which he does with virtually every book he writes, that the story just becomes soft porn books.  Of course teen boys love it!  But this is not real science fiction.<br /> The writing of Piers Anthony is mediocre at best, lacking in complex characters.  His strength is good plots and knowing how to turn teen boys on.	2000-10-17

Kay has some real imagination and beauty to his books.  His ideas are truly original and his world is on full of wonder.<br /> Nonetheless, I found his writing style a hindrance to being fully immersed in this book, and the following books of the series.  He is choppy and downright confusing at times.  It is not that he is a complex writer - I don't mind that.  It is that he seems to be trying to be complex and comes off being vague and confusing.<br /> With that said, this book is one of the better ones of the fantasy genre.  And, as a fellow Canadian with Kay, I wish him all the best!	2000-10-17

Written and published in three separate parts in the 70s, this book is timeless. Its depth and daring surpass anything I have read in recent memory. Capon deliberately uses the parable of a love affair between two already married people just to push you a bit closer to the edge of discomfort. Actually, I think he pushed me over that edge. This book makes you want to raise your finger and say, &quot;Yeah, but...&quot; - then it silences you because you know that he is laying bare the scandal of God's love and grace, resurrecting us from the death of sin. Not &quot;because of...&quot; or &quot;as long as....&quot; not &quot;only if you....&quot;; there are no conditions, no promises of a changed life, no cost to ourselves and even no choice for us to make. Capon is clear that God's grace is entirely &quot;In Spite Of&quot;; no, perhaps thats too weak because you don't resurrect someone &quot;in spite of death&quot;...you just do it and give them life. God gives life out of Love...sin just doesn't come into play beyond the fact that it brought death in the first place. God just doesn't see it anymore. As Capon says, he only sees, &quot;Jesus, Jesus, Jesus.&quot; Wow. There are few books that have made me want to shout to everyone the truth about Grace, the scandal of God's radical Liberation, Resurrection and Love. It is so radical as to be offensive. Yes, this book offends; may I be so offended more often by God's irrational Love for us!	2000-10-17

As my theology professor says, Barth is &quot;deceptively easy&quot; to read.  This is indeed true.  You read a paragraph and think you get an idea of what he is saying, but the philosophical ramifications of his perspectives are enormous.  They blow apart human, frail understandings of God and forces one to view things differently, yet in a refreshing way.  A great beginning to a monumental theologian.	2000-10-11

I can tell just from the reviews that Benny Hinn is one of those guys who truly HAVE touched lives and who HAVE brought people to faith - true faith in God.  Does this mean that Benny Hinn himself has a worthy ministry?  By no means!  God even used the King of Babylon to show a lesson to the people of Israel. And the apostle Paul says that even when people are preaching with bad intentions, as long as the gospel is preached, then the Lord is working.<br />Now, Benny Hinn is simply a heretic.  He says that there is no, Trinity, but God is made up of nine.  He prophesies things that don't happen (e.g., that God would destroy all homosexuals in 1994).  He has a ministry on TV which drips with bad theology and is devoid of any humility.<br />So, all I can say is that God works through Benny Hinn IN SPITE of his severe failings for which he should be removed from the pulpit.  I would also venture to say that, with all the people he has brought to the Lord, he still does more harm than good for the faith.  People need to learn to think more critically and those who read the book and think it is good seem unable to do so.	2000-09-20

I am sick of annoying &quot;kudos&quot; given to other fantasy books that tout the newest fantasy book to be comparable to  Tolkien....and it NEVER is.  I have yet to find a fantsy book or series  that approahces Tolkien in style, intelligence, form and story.  Perhaps it  is becuase he was not, per se, just a writer - he let this come from within  out of his work as a linguist and other experiences in life.  To all the  book reviewers out there: stop comparing anything to Tolkien until someone  can REALLY write something that is as good as this series.  It gives  unnecessary praise to only passable literature and brings down the true  esprit that abounds in LOTR.	2000-03-01
