All I knew about this book was that it was a re-telling of the Avengers' early days. I love the Avengers, so I thought, \\"How can I go wrong?\\"  I wish I had read some reviews before I ordered this!<br /><br />First, what's good:<br /><br />The artwork by Scott Kolins is decent.  He has a clean style that suits the story and characters well.  It's not too cartoon-y and it's not bogged down with over-the-top detail.  It's fun to see the different versions of the heroes costumes, especially Iron Man's. He goes from his old clunky getup to sleeker designs.  The Wasp's costume goes through some funky changes too.<br /><br />What's bad:<br /><br />This book tries to jam too much into what was an eight comic run.  There were times when  I thought I had skipped a page, or maybe one was missing.  It felt like a badly edited movie.  The writer, Joe Casey, often drops the reader into the middle of some big crisis with villains like Kang or the Masters of Evil, with virtually no explanation.  It's a lot of snapshots of Avengers' history that don't fit together as a single story.  You'll be asking yourself questions like, \\"Why are they in outer space all of a sudden?\\" or \\"Who the hell is Rick Jones?\\"<br /><br />The biggest flaw of the book is that it \\"revisits\\" the time when Stan Lee and Jack Kirby told these stories, but the book shows cell phones, cable TV, and computers.  If Joe Casey is re-telling old stories, why does he set them in the present?  This makes no sense at all.  At least he could have left the time period ambiguous, but he hits you over the head with the whole \\"present-day\\" concept.<br /><br />There is an attempt to tie the chapters together with Captain America's quest to kill Baron Zemo to avenge the death of his sidekick Bucky.  This almost holds things together, but not quite.  There are too many side stories squeezed in here. Maybe an editor told Casey \\"OK, you've got eight issues to cover these 50 events, good luck.\\"<br /><br />Skip this book and check out \\"The New Avengers\\" and \\"The Ultimates.\\"  Learn from this comic fan's mistake!luck.\\" <br /> <br />Skip this book and check out \\"The New Avengers\\" and \\"The Ultimates.\\"  Learn from this comic fan's mistake!	2005-08-31

Too many cooks in the kitchen usually turn out garbage when it comes to comics, but not this time.  This is a solid story thoughout.  The standout writers on this project are Greg Rucka and Ed Brubaker.  The artwork is all fine, but the stylistic shifts can be pretty jarring.  It seems like the artists were more concerned with keeping things consistent in their own titles (this is a blending of several ongoing \\"Bat-family\\" titles) and not too concerned about the flow of this collection.  The team of writers manage to hold things together despite this small problem.<br /><br />This book covers some important changes in the world of Batman, so if you're a true-blue Bat-fan, you should pick this up.<br /><br />Greg Rucka's \\"Evolution: New Gotham 1\\" is excellent (better than this actually), but not required reading before \\"Officer Down: New Gotham 2\\".  The two volumes don't really have anything to do with eachother.<br /><br />For more great Bat-related books check out:<br /><br />The Long Halloween<br /><br />Dark Victory<br /><br />Batman/Huntress: Cry for Blood<br /><br />Gotham Central<br /><br />Catwoman (just the ones by Ed Brubaker)<br /><br />Birds of Prey (just the ones by Gail Simone)<br /><br />Happy Reading!	2005-08-03

Unfortunately, the first half of this book was a letdown for me.  The humor mostly fell flat and the whole \\"She-Hulk as Intergalactic Judge\\" storyline was pretty boring.<br /><br />The book really picks up steam in the second half. The whole Titania story is GREAT, we get her origin story and a big showdown with She-Hulk.  The two halves of the book are related, so you can't just skip to the good part.

This little-known book (Rising Stars: Vol. 1) is a storytelling gem.  His character development is top-notch.  He's one of just a handful of writers that can take a super hero story and make it feel real.<br /><br />Volumes 2 and 3 are also well crafted.  My only complaint is the constant change of artists.  All of the artists are good, it just disturbs the flow of the books a bit.  Straczynski's masterful writing makes up for this minor gripe.<br /><br />Check out J.M.S.'s \\"Supreme Power\\" books, and also \\"Midnight Nation,\\"  both are stunning titles.

The situation is barely in the book! Here it is:<br /><br />---------------------------------------<br /><br />[At the end of Chapter 2...]<br /><br />Nightwing: \\"...I've been working alone for quite a while now and it's...fine, I'm good at it, but I --- sometimes I'm just so...\\"<br /><br />Huntress: \\"...lonely?\\" [they kiss]<br /><br />[Beginning of Chapter 3...]<br /><br />Nightwing wakes up in her apartment wearing only his boxer-briefs.<br /><br />---------------------------------------<br /><br />That's it! Not even PG-13.<br /><br />Yes, the love connection seems a little forced and awkward. However, there is a great crime story here, and it's only briefly interrupted by this minor episode. Their short romance leads to some great tension in future DC books, like in Birds of Prey (Huntress joins that group of super-chicks along with Nightwing's sort-of girlfriend, Oracle). It does not ruin this book. Here's why...<br /><br />Devin Grayson does a great job with the crime story, a suspenseful thriller about a murder, the mafia, and crooked cops. The author creates a compelling tale that you want to keep reading. Ms. Grayson explores the characters' differences and similarities, explaining their opposing philosophies on crime-fighting and life in general. This shows why their personal relationship can only go so far.<br /><br />The artists do a fine job as well. Greg Land and Bill Sienkiewicz team up for some memorable artwork, detailed but not over-done.<br /><br />So in the end, I would recommend this book. An even better one is the \\"Batman & Huntress\\" trade paperback by Greg Rucka, a great crime story and Huntress' origin story are included. Huntress is also depicted well in Gail Simone's run on \\"Birds of Prey,\\" Simone has rescued that series. If you want more Nightwing, check out Judd Winick's run on the \\"Outsiders,\\" a fun and gritty super-team book.<br /><br />Happy reading!want more Nightwing, check out Judd Winick's run on the \\"Outsiders,\\" a fun and gritty super-team book.  <br /> <br />Happy reading! <br /> <br />	2005-07-25

I really wanted to like \\"Nightwing: Big Guns,\\" but I just couldn't.  Nightwing could be a great character in the hands of a better writer.<br /><br />Nightwing (a.k.a. Dick Grayson, the former Robin) joins the Bludhaven police force for his day job, trying to do some good inside the system.  Sounds like a great premise right?  It goes nowhere!<br /><br />This book is loaded with scattered action, with no real point.  The \\"mysteries\\" seem like they're straight out of Scooby Doo.  If Dixon aimed this book at little kids that would be fine, but I suspect a kid would get lost in this steaming mess.<br /><br />The artwork (by four different pencillers) is OK.

It's definitely not for young kids, it's at least a PG-13 book.<br /><br />Judd Winick's writing continues to surprise me.  I keep thinking he's going to run out of gas, but no, he keeps the reader hooked with great storytelling.  He isn't afraid to take chances with these beloved DC characters, he doesn't handle them with kid gloves like other writers have.<br /><br />The Metamorpho storyline is intriguing, the return of Black Lightning has a great nostalgia factor, and the presence of Huntress is always a plus.  My one complaint is that Winick's depiction of Nightwing is pretty flat, he could be a great leading character, but he just isn't.  The supporting characters save the day here.<br /><br />\\"Outsiders: Sum of all Evil (Vol. 2)\\" is a great read for any comic fan over the age of 13.  Be sure to check out Vol. 1 first!	2005-06-22

I expected a somber read, but found myself laughing out loud several times.  He doesn't take the questions of Life and Death too lightly, nor does he take them too seriously.  He finds the perfect mix of melancholia, humor, depression, and excitement.<br /><br />Hornby writes the book in first person, but the point of view is passed around between the four main characters.  My main concern when I discovered this format was that I was going to be re-living events through the four characters eyes, constantly back-tracking in time to get all points of view.  Fortunately, Hornby avoids this pitfall by never having the story fold back on itself.  This preserves the forward motion of the story.  The reader is left with the impression that four very different people have written their personal memoirs and an editor deftly pieced them together to create a moving story.  We've all read books where a young girl is speaking and you just can't get it out of your head that a middle-aged man is writing how he imagines a young girl would speak.  Hornby doesn't have that problem. He writes from the point of view of different ages, sexes, and nationalities.  You don't feel the heavy hand of the author weighing down their words.  So in the end, Hornby's fiction feels like non-fiction.<br /><br />While Hornby creates and develops his convincing characters, he includes insightful commentary on current London (and global) culture, such as the \\"Starbuck-ing\\" of the world, tabloid culture, and our obsession with celebrity.  He doesn't necessarily condemn these things, he just starts conversations about them, or rather his characters do.  Hornby takes some highly unlikeable people and fleshes them out so the reader cares what they think, and most importantly cares if they live or die.<br /><br />I didn't really enjoy Hornby's last book, \\"How to be Good.\\"  I agree with several Amazon reviewers of HTBG who wrote something like, \\"That was an interesting premise and a fun ride, but what was the point?\\"  I felt like I had wasted a few days of reading.  \\"A Long Way Down\\" begins in a manner similar to \\"How to be Good,\\"  an intriguing but highly implausible exposition that shows great promise.  While reading I was saying to myself, \\"Don't burn me again Hornby!  Don't take me on this wild journey for no apparent reason!\\"  Fortunately, \\"A Long Way Down\\" has a point.  Not one I can sum up in a few sentences, but a point nonetheless.<br /><br />There's no way to discuss the plot without ruining the book for you.  Just order the book and enjoy a brilliant summer read.an interesting premise and a fun ride, but what was the point?\\"  I felt like I had wasted a few days of reading.  \\"A Long Way Down\\" begins in a manner similar to \\"How to be Good,\\"  an intriguing but highly implausible exposition that shows great promise.

Rucka is not a Brit, but he tries writing for English characters. Surprisingly, Rucka deftly handles the dialogue without sounding like he's just sticking in a \\"bloody\\" or a \\"sod off\\" here and there.  He successfully immerses the reader in the world of British black ops.<br /><br />This book reminds me of the American TV show \\"Alias,\\" but without the romance and convoluted relationships. This is a straight-forward spy book, with believable action and well-crafted character development.<br /><br />Many people have complained about Steve Rolston's simplistic artwork style.  It doesn't bother me.  I wouldn't say he's my favorite artist, but it doesn't get in the way of Rucka's brilliant story.	2005-05-29

So I picked up this book based on that e-mail and the stellar reviews written here.<br /><br />Notaro shoots for her target audience, women in their late 20's to late 30's, and scores big time.  If you fall into that demographic, you will love it. I, however, am a MAN.  So I had a hard time relating to this stuff. I really gave it a chance though. It's not bad at all, it's just not for me.<br /><br />Comparing her to Sedaris is unfair, she has a completely different style.

I think the team of artists were going for a simple/classic Tim Sale kind of feel, but don't quite pull it off.  The limited color palette is unusual (entire chapters use only a few colors), but this doesn't bother me.  It creates an unreal feeling, so you can accept people transforming into animals... well, almost.<br /><br />What saves the book is the writing of Greg Rucka.  After his HUGE hit with the recent Batman comic, \\"The OMAC Project,\\" I wanted to check out his earlier stuff.  So I ordered this and I wasn't disappointed.  Rucka understands that Batman books work well when Bruce Wayne is allowed to be a detective, not just a grunting badass.  Even though Ra's al Ghul is probably my least favorite Batman villain, I enjoyed his part of the story.  The Two-Face chapter is solid too.  I like how Rucka includes characters from \\"Gotham Central,\\" like Detective Montoya (the Two-Face chapter revolves around her).<br /><br />Check out Rucka's work on the \\"Batman & Huntress\\" trade paperback (an excellent read) and the acclaimed \\"Queen and Country\\" series.<br /><br />Happy reading!	2005-05-10

There are so many great books about Rumi's writings, but I suggest you pick up this one for an introduction to his brillaint poetry.  It includes a brief overview of Sufism, the mystical branch of Islam that was founded in part by Rumi.  It also includes a brief overview of his life.  Another useful feature is the explanation of selected terms and symbolism in the back of the book.<br /><br />My favorite poem in the book is \\"This Eternal Play.\\"<br />Here are the opening lines:<br /><br />\\"At dawn the Moon appeared in the sky.<br />It floated down and looked at me.<br />Then, like a hawk snatching it's prey,<br />it grabbed hold of me<br />and dragged me across the sky.\\"<br /><br />Stunning, magical work!

I was hoping to gain some insight about the weirdo guy who did my audit and the odd, fortress-like feeling of the IRS building.<br /><br />What I found in Richard Yancey's  book was a big surprise:  a brilliant character study of the protagonist, an IRS collection agent with a conscience, and his riveting observations of everything around him.  He explains the no-mercy, warfare mindset that is drilled into the heads of collection agents.  He has a great cast of characters, fascinating explorations of both the collectors and their prey.  The most intriguing part of book is Yancey's personal transformation.  This is well-written, compelling stuff,  done in sort of a David Sedaris memoir style, funny but sometimes painful. Although it's non-fiction, there is a real story here, with a beginning, middle, and end.  This is quite a trick to pull off in a non-fiction book.

My one complaint is that I've noticed a slight change in tone this time.  He can be a little smug.  I'll explain...<br /><br />In Sedaris' earlier books, he presents stories about the pre-famous David Sedaris.  The description of his struggles as a writer/artist/son/brother were hilarious and bittersweet.  The newer material from him feels like he is more aware of himself as an accomplished writer.  It still works, just not quite as well.  I understand that he writes non-fiction about his life, and we can't fault him for being successful.  This new tone is most evident in his story about visiting the Anne Frank house.  He writes about his obsession with finding the perfect place to live, and how this place would be really great.  Not funny.<br /><br />This didn't ruin the whole book for me. I enjoyed the story about his brother's wedding the most.  The stories about his brother, \\"Rooster,\\" are always hysterically funny.<br /><br />Check out \\"Me Talk Pretty One Day,\\" \\"Naked,\\" and \\"Holidays on Ice\\" before picking this one up.

I'll explain...<br /><br />I read \\"Me Talk Pretty One Day\\" first and was blown away by it's clever, concise style.  I laughed out loud many, many times.  Then I read \\"Naked,\\" another fantastic book.  Both of these are written in a memoir style, snapshots of his hilarious and often painful life.<br /><br />\\"Barrel Fever\\" on the other hand has a lot of satire, not a lot of his effective memoir style.  It seems like he's searching for his voice in this book.  However, he does strike gold with \\"The Santaland Diaries,\\"  the hysterical description of his job as an elf for a mall Santa.  This story is also printed in \\"Holidays on Ice.\\"  I would recommend that book in place of \\"Barrel Fever.\\"<br /><br />\\"Naked,\\" \\"Me Talk...,\\" and \\"Dress Your Family...\\" are all great books.  Order them and laugh yourself sick.	2005-04-13

Not in an Archie Comics kind of way, but in a clever, modern, and thoughtful way.  The writer, Dan Slott, sets a tone that is not self-conscious, the book never takes itself TOO seriously. And it really works!  It's not corny or cheesy like you might expect.  The book contains honest-to-god HUMOR, something missing from most super-hero books.  The overall premise works well too.  She-Hulk (aka Jennifer Walters) goes to work for a law firm and specializes in super-human cases.  I disagree with the reviewer who said it was too much \\"Ally McBeal.\\"  Slott finds a great balance between courtroom drama, action, and comedy.<br /><br />Both artists working on this book are excellent (Juan Bobillo & Paul Pelletier).  Their styles are very different, but both serve the stories well.  Bobillo depicts a more petite She-Hulk, and Pelletier draws a bigger, muscled-up version of her.<br /><br />Happy reading!	2005-04-12

Sounds good, right?<br /><br />I'm sorry to say that this is a really weak book.  It has one of the worst villains ever, Napoleon, complete with the full Frenchie-poo outfit.  The Punisher has some god-awful lines like:  \\"This is your Waterloo.\\"  ((groan))  The book is totally predictable.  Punisher and Wolvie start out at odds, then have to team up to get out of the criminal infested town of Erewhon (the world's most obvious anagram).<br /><br />The artwork is decent, that's why I'm giving this book a couple of stars.<br /><br />If you like the Punisher, check out Garth Ennis' stuff.  \\"Welcome Back Frank\\" and \\"In the Beginning\\" are both very good.  If you're a Wolverine fan, check out  \\"Origin.\\"  Astonishing X-men and Ultimate X-men are my favorite team books with him.  I'm not a big fan of the solo Wolverine series.<br /><br />These team-up books never seem to work.  Oh well, there are plenty of great graphic novels out there to choose from.<br /><br />Happy reading!	2005-04-12

I reluctantly ordered it, and I'm really glad I did.  It is a comprehensive learning tool for any organist, useful exercises and great pieces are included.<br /><br />I called every music store in my area and no one had this book, but Amazon did!  I could have hunted for this book in stores forever.  Save yourself the trouble and order it here.<br /><br />This book is not for pianists who want a quick transition to the organ, but for serious students of the instrument.  There are plenty of cheaper organ method books out there, but the Gleason is the best.	2005-04-12

A lot of people have panned it, expecting another \\"Alias,\\"  Bendis' earlier series about private investigator Jessica Jones.  That book was more suited for adults, but this is book is set up for mass consumption.  It's still really good.  Yes, all the cursing is gone, but it still works.<br /><br />There's a lot less of Jessica in this than one might expect.  The book is about a group of reporters at the Daily Bugle that specialize in super-hero stories.  So Jessica is just a part of the ensemble.  You do get more info about her relationship with Luke Cage, something \\"Alias\\" fans have been waiting for.<br /><br />I love the whole \\"investigative reporter\\" idea of this book.  While mysteries unravel, the reader gets hooked.<br /><br />I'd give this 5 stars if it weren't for the poor artwork.  It looks like a cartoon-y rush job.  I've heard that the comic series is getting a better artist, so hopefully the next TPB will reflect that change.  Bendis' writing saves the book.<br /><br />No matter how much the fans want it, this will never be another \\"Alias.\\"  If you can accept this, pick up \\"The Pulse.\\"	2005-04-03

If you can stomach the gore, by all means pick this one up.  The artwork is stunning.  The ending is genius, not your typical Hollywood ending.<br /><br />I enjoyed \\"A Dame to Kill For\\" and \\"That Yellow Bastard\\" much more than this book.  \\"Dame\\" and \\"Bastard\\" are more involved stories, with more character development.  You care about what happens to the characters.  These books are told in a classic \\"noir\\" style, with Frank Miller's modern twist .  There's nothing else like this series in the world of graphic novels.<br /><br />There are a bunch of Sin City books out there that are collections of short stories.  I prefer the longer stories, so they feel more like a book than a comic.  If you feel the same way, order the titles I mentioned above, and also get \\"The Big Fat Kill.\\"<br /><br />In the movie, Marv is played by Mickey Rourke.  His story is covered in the first third of the film.  Rourke does a great job, but the makeup job makes him look like a villain from Dick Tracy.  Still a great movie.<br /><br />Happy reading!	2005-04-02

The main story is about Dwight and... well, I won't ruin the book by giving away the whole story.  Just buy it, you won't be sorry.<br /><br />\\"Dame to Kill For,\\" and \\"That Yellow Bastard\\" are also excellent.  \\"The Hard Goodbye\\" was a little gory for my taste, so if ultra-violence isn't your bag, you could skip that one (it's a \\"stand-alone\\" story anyway).<br /><br />\\"The Big Fat Kill\\" is represented in the movie with the Clive Owen/Rosario Dawson parts, about the middle third of the film.<br /><br />This is one great book!	2005-04-02

Check it out!<br /><br />This book has two complete stories in it:<br /><br />Part One - \\"Itsy-Bitsy Spider\\" - It's the story of two Black Widows duking it out for their right to claim the name, and a great bio-weapon/spy story.  The writing has a great forward motion to it, and the artwork is sexy without being crass.<br /><br />Part Two - \\"Breakdown\\" - This is more about the two Black Widows, with a story similar to the movie Face-Off.  There's a major stylistic shift in the artwork here, more of a painted look.  It works well.  Great appearances by Nick Fury and Daredevil too.<br /><br />This book is a fun read, but definitely not for little kids.  Black Widow is a great character, and this book does her justice.  I'm looking forward to her next TPB coming out in the spring.	2005-04-02

The story and artwork are just perfect.<br /><br />I was a fan of the X-men from way back in the Claremont/Byrne era (in the distant 1980's), and have recently returned to comics as an adult.  All aspects of the X-men have come a long way since then.  Whedon has better character development than Claremont ever had,  and Cassaday's art has incredible detail.  There are fewer words on the page than in the days of the old X-men, so it's a faster read than the Claremont books, but it's well-paced.  Whedon's writing is concise, just right.<br /><br />I know what you're thinking:  \\"What about the Phoenix Saga?\\"<br />This is better.<br /><br />Do not miss this book!	2005-04-01

Straczynski's writing and Frank's artwork come together with freshness and originality.<br /><br />The story has a lot of great Heaven and Hell stuff, kind of like Garth Ennis' \\"Preacher\\" books with a bit of X-files thrown in.  It's pretty intense, definitely not for kids.  It's nice and long, so you can settle down for a good read.<br /><br />And you won't see the ending coming, it's handled very well.  This was a joy to read.  Check it out!	2005-04-01

I loved it then, but looking back now, it was some pretty simplistic stuff.<br /><br />This book on the other hand is... GREAT!  It's a pretty slow moving character study, but don't let that scare you off.  Straczynski is building up a great back-story for all of the heroes, slowing assembling the team.  I love how he's taking his time with it.  I enjoy his adult view of the super-hero world.  A little more realistic (if you can accept people flying) and a lot darker.  The best part of this book is Hyperion's origin story, very well done.<br /><br />Gary Frank's artwork is stunning, a perfect match for Straczynksi's brilliant story.  Check out another one of their books, \\"Midnight Nation,\\" published by Top Cow.  This was just re-released so it's pretty easy to get now.  It's equally good.<br /><br />If you grew up reading comics, and are thinking about revisiting them as an adult, check out \\"Supreme Power: Contact.\\"  You won't be sorry!	2005-04-01

That's where you'll get all the exposition (Bruce is framed for murder, goes to prison, breaks out, etc.).  That book is spotty, but still worth picking up. It has so many writers on it, there doesn't seem to be a single vision for the book.<br /><br />On to this book, \\"Fugitive #1\\"...<br /><br />This book is much, much better.  We still have a bunch of writers (Grayson and Brubaker are the standouts, and even Dixon is OK) but it somehow works here.  The story has a more natural flow to it than the last one.  There's a lot of the \\"Bat-family\\" in this (Nightwing, Robin, Oracle, Batgirl, etc.) trying to clear Bruce's name.  Not very much Batman here.  It's a solid mystery with some fun detective work.  I didn't even mind the Robin and Batgirl chapters (these are usually pretty crummy titles).<br /><br />There is no resolution at the end of this book, so you'll have to buy the later books to get answers to all the questions raised here.<br /><br />I had a great time with this.

I decided to buy this book after reading the latest She-Hulk TPB \\"Single Green Female\\" (a great book by the way).<br />This book, \\"The Search for She-Hulk,\\" was pretty good, but She-Hulk is all \\"hulked-out\\" in it, on a rage-a-thon.  It's a little boring to see her like this.<br /><br />The writing is just OK.  Apparently better than the other Avengers TPB's from this era (most have really bad reviews on the Amazon site).<br /><br />What saves this book is the artwork.  It's stunning.The depictions of Captain America and the Scarlet Witch are awesome.<br /><br />I grew up reading the Avengers, so it was fun to revisit them.	2005-03-27

Glen Fabry does a great job, very detailed stuff.<br /><br />What's bad:<br />The story is like a B-movie script. Something the robots on Mystery Science Theater 3000 would have a field day with.  It's just plain hokey.  About the violence/gore,  I don't mind it if there's a good story that requires it.  We don't have that here.  Too many severed heads! And the evil zombie Vikings look like something out of Michael Jackson's \\"Thriller\\" video.  Kinda goofy.<br /><br />I bought this book after reading Garth Ennis' \\"Preacher\\" series (a fantastic set of books that you should buy), so I had my hopes up really high.<br /><br />Check out Ennis' \\"Fury\\" book, about an aging, cranky Nick Fury.  I enjoyed that book much more than Ennis' attempt at a Thor book.  His newer MAX run on \\"Punisher\\" has been good too.	2005-03-27

Books	4	3	5	N	N	spotty, but worth getting	The concept is intriguing, but the mish-mash of all the Bat-titles doesn't quite work, here's why:<br /><br />There are a pile of writers on this, so there isn't really a single vision for the tone of the book.  All of the Greg Rucka and Ed Brubaker (writers) parts are fantastic.  They both cover the inside-the-prison parts of the story, very well done.  The Batgirl and Robin chapters are really poor.  Cheesy writing with manga style art. The Nightwing chapters (written by Chuck Dixon) are just so-so.  Luckily Brubaker wrote the final chapter, the best part.<br /><br />It's a shame that Ed Brubaker is leaving DC for good (he signed exclusively with Marvel).  His work on Catwoman, Gotham Central, and Sleeper has been amazing (buy these!).  Luckily, Rucka is staying around.<br /><br />So this book gets 4 stars from me because of these two writers.  I used to think Chuck Dixon was OK, but seeing him side by side with these guys makes me think he should take some pointers from them.	2005-03-26

This is the Marvel Universe from an adult point of view.  You've still got Captain America, the Avengers, Daredevil, your old Marvel favorites here, but they're filtered through an adult's eyes. The first word of the book is \\"F---!\\"<br /><br />The protagonist, private investigator Jessica Jones, is complex, not totally likeable, like a real person.  She has super powers but chooses not to use them (more is revealed about her background in the later books).<br /><br />I'm not a \\"Bendis can do no wrong\\" kind of guy.  A lot of his stuff is fluff written to please young fans and sell books.  Not this time.  This is a character piece, a huge risk in the comic biz.  This might explain its short run.<br /><br />The artwork is dark and moody, a refreshing change from the typically glammed out super-hero books.  The art fits the character perfectly.<br /><br />All four Alias books are totally engaging from start to finish.  If you only buy one graphic novel, GET THIS!<br /><br />There are rumors that this series will come back.  I hope so!<br /><br />Jessica Jones is currently in \\"The Pulse,\\" a comic where she works for the Daily Bugle.  It's an \\"ensemble cast\\" kind of book so she's not really in it that much.  If you really want more of her story, Pulse is worth picking up.  But get the other three Alias books first!	2005-03-26

This TPB is a perfect example of his unique style, classic noir with a modern twist.  The writing is concise, not overly wordy.  He knows how to craft a great crime story.<br /><br />Brubaker and Stewart's depiction of Catwoman/Selina Kyle is spot-on.  Sexy, tough, and elegant all at the same time.  I like the new direction of \\"is she a villain or hero?\\"  This leads to many more great questions for the character.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Brubaker is leaving DC to go to Marvel exclusively.  This is #3 of his Catwoman TPB run.  Pick up #1 and #2.  They are a joy to read.	2005-03-26
