Or any endings, for that matter. The stories just stop and leave you with a quizzical, slightly annoyed grimace. However, they are well-written, finely observed character studies -- snapshots of quiet desperation detailing the sometimes funny, often contemptible minutiae of human behavior. (If Jackson were around today, she'd probably be the star writer on \\"Curb Your Enthusiasm.\\")<br /><br />There are a few satisfying tales -- the title piece (though a little more predictable post-\\"Twilight Zone\\" than it must have been when originally published), \\"After You, My Dear Alphonse,\\" \\"Charles\\" and \\"Colloquy\\" -- not coincidentally, the only narratives with some sort of punchline.  Meanwhile, there are others I might refer to when trying to illustrate a certain archetype, but that doesn't translate to literary fulfillment.	2005-08-07

The accounts are interesting, but not any moreso than any decent true paranormal account book. I guess from an author who's described on the cover as being \\"hailed as Britain's most accurate medium,\\" I expected something a bit more... well... unbelievable. As I was reading this, I kept thinking of the Onion story, \\"The Thinkable Happens to Local Man\\": \\"...\\"'I can believe what I just saw,' one witness told reporters. 'In all my years, I can honestly say I've seen many things like that. Who wouldn't have thought that this, or something very much like it, could happen?'\\"<br /><br />Still, this is a worthwhile addition to the collection of any psychic phenomena enthusiast, and would be a fun and fascinating read for any newcomer to the subject.	2005-08-02

But he makes a good case, and the khu vs. ka theory was enlightening.<br /><br />\\"Doubles\\" is not what I'd originally hoped -- a compendium of accounts in which a doppelganger was shown to be a separate entity acting in its own interests, and the shockhorror that ensued -- but there are some good doppel-examples cited, even if they are OOBE-related. While I've always been interested in OOBEs, I thought doppelgangers were a separate thing, since they often seem solid and real and can talk and act independently of the original person. But this book does give compelling evidence as to how (and why) a projection can take form, and that the levels of consciousness/interaction depend on how much energy it still has after separating from the body.<br /><br />Davies also goes into other interesting ideas as well, like were-animals being half-OOBE, half-dream type things. That might be a little \\"out there\\" for most people, but if you're reading this review, you're probably a little \\"out there\\" yourself! ;)	2005-08-02

While \\"Narnia\\" has to remain in a class of its own, both series are brilliant, opening up whole new realms of imagination on an epic and heroic scale, and the world is a much better place for their existence.<br /><br />I am now fully appreciating the character arc Rowling has wrought for Harry; all the trials and tribulations he has gone through are forging him into a true hero. Harry's still learning with every step but Rowling has masterfully involved us in the building of his skills to a greater purpose that's revealed to the readers and the characters simultaneously. And all the greater themes of nobility, love, friendship, loyalty and bravery are flawlessly and subtly imbued in every chapter.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Rowling doesn't gloss over human flaws, shading each protagonist with realistic foibles, and acknowledging that even the closest allies won't always see eye to eye -- but that their bond will eventually enable them to overcome any differences and difficulties. Similarly, I'm very gratified by Harry's impatience for fools and users and that sort of thing -- rather than be a transcendent goody-two-shoes who automatically forgives those who know not what they do, he confronts the worst offenders and doesn't have time for the lesser. At the same time, if an enemy shows humanity, he has the inner wisdom to take that into consideration.<br /><br />All of these greater aspirations and grand themes might be unbearably grandiose were they more overt, but they only emerge on reflection of the whole; the page-to-page experience is of the fascinating, dryly humorous, exciting adventures of Harry and his friends.<br /><br />The next... and last...book should be an absolute revelation -- but it will be universally mourned when this story comes to a close. Fawkes' song will resonate in the hearts and souls of each and every \\"Potter\\" fan.	2005-07-26

Engagingly told, versus the writings of the field's top expert, Dr. Ian Stevenson, which I find fascinating but a bit dry.<br /><br />The majority of the book is story after story of top-notch reincarnation cases, with all the electrifying wonder of the revelations excitingly imparted with a great sense of buildup, detail and payoff.<br /><br />The predominant focus is on children whose parents believe they are reincarnations of a deceased family member because of uncanny remarks, inexplicable recognition of certain people and places, and, most astoundingly, birthmarks that distinctly match up with fatal wounds. Bowman balances these riveting accounts with thoughtful insights into the purpose of reincarnation, gleaned from the between-both-worlds musings of the subjects themselves.<br /><br />There are a couple of times when Bowman goes a little too much into her personal feelings, and that to me somewhat undermines her professional persona, but it may make the book more accessible to others, particularly those new to the concept.<br /><br />Anyone interested in past-life phenomena must add this book to their collection.	2005-07-14

It reminds me a lot of Ben Stiller and Janeane Garofalo's \\"Feel This Book\\" -- a thrown-together assemblage of unpolished, unedited anecdotes, strung into some sort of theme just before deadline. The unifying topic here is how to be cool, with advice like go to the gym, get pedicures, drink water to appear disciplined and mysterious, and don't act desperate. A few pop culture references here, a few Dennis Miller-caliber obscure allusions there, some self-effacing humor, some self-aggrandizing asides -- all coming off like the first draft any latter-day Gen Xer with any wit would write if compelled by the promise of fame and a cash advance to put her perspective on paper. There's some potentially good stuff, but it needs shape, form, refinement, context. Right now we have a compendium of not bad Jane Magazine humor/advice columns.<br /><br />Particularly off-putting: ostensibly guileless mentions of the author's sexy magazine spreads; her belief that she should have been able to hold her grade school teachers and classmates hostage with her non-stop opinions; the egregious omnipresence of \\"I'm not advocating\\"-type caveats; the deja-vu similarity of all the chapters.	2005-06-15

Her wit is sharp and speaks to issues most women have but few will acknowledge. The first time I read this I was fairly blown away by the insight and brutal honesty, and more importantly the wry approach to both. I felt vindicated in seeing some of my issues validated by Suzanne's unabashed articulation of them (The \\"Why? Why would you think I would want to know that?\\" exchange... \\"What is it about me that looks like I would want to know there are other smart pretty girls? Because I'll fix it. I'll change it. Is it something I'm wearing? Is my lip curled in a certain way that says, 'Got to tell her there's another bright woman around'? Why would you think I would want to know that a beautiful, gorgeous, supermarket-famous face from television is as bright and funny as I am?\\")<br /><br />One of the earlier passages taking us first-person through a fellow drug rehab patient's series of rationalizations that takes him from swearing off drugs through doing endless hits of coke and following that up with ecstasy, heroin and whatever was in his dealer's medicine cabinet was really quite impressively executed; its few pages were far more potent than the entire D.A.R.E. program ever was.<br /><br />Re-reading this years later and after reading \\"The Best Awful,\\" I felt that \\"Postcards\\" was a little too self-congratulatory re: the protagonist's clever rejoinders. But I think my mid-'90s 25-year-old self would still find it seminal and deeply resonant.	2005-06-07

Like its protagonist, this book tries way too hard and, despite sparks of vibrancy, drives you away. Suzanne Vale's endless witticisms are supposed to become obnoxious, which they do, but I think they're still supposed to be clever enough to be admired, which they're not.

There is only so much one can take of Carrie Fisher's alter ego.<br /><br />Why she named \\"Surrender the Pink's\\" character Dinah Kaufman when she bears no discernible difference from Suzanne Vale is confusing at best and damning of Fisher's ability to see outside herself at worst. In \\"The Best Awful,\\" Suzanne even steals one of Dinah's jokes -- the aphrodisiac/anglodisiac line, which isn't even that funny.<br /><br />Dinah and Suzanne have all the same quips and cadences and bad taste in men, and they become grating fast. The flirty non-sequiturs, the desperate attempts to be witty at all times. Worse, here, Dinah writes for a soap opera and creates a character that's just like her who pops up from time to time with one-liners of her own (all too florid to ever fly on daytime TV), so we have yet another Carrie Fisher incarnation to contend with.<br /><br />Fisher and her characters try too hard, and then talk a lot about trying too hard.	2005-06-07

It was written decently enough, with a couple of glimmers of wit -- ironic definitions of slightly sophisticated words, and narrator Lemony Snicket's brief allusions to his own misadventures -- but, at least in the first book, there wasn't enough use of Klaus' encyclopedic knowledge or Violet's talent, which I can't even recall. (A glance through Amazon's reader reviews reveals she is a \\"genius inventor\\" -- I remember that being mentioned but don't recall it coming into play in any compelling way.) Even if the subsequent books do play up these elements more satisfactorily, there wasn't enough to interest or impress me in \\"Bad Beginning\\" to force myself to read the same story over and over.	2005-03-06

The OCD-riddled protagonist, Daniel Pecan Cambridge, comes off fairly creepy at first, but Martin artfully turns the reader around in an almost imperceptible transition. Daniel's awareness of the ridiculousness of his limitations -- as well as those of others -- and his eloquent, non-judgmental articulation of such soon makes him relatively winsome. A reviewer quoted on the jacket calls Martin's writing \\"wryly omniscient and ruthlessly truthful\\" -- that's exactly what I thought (without having hit upon that perfect phrase) when reading \\"Shopgirl\\" (actually what that reviewer was referring to), and that incredibly perceptive yet unselfconscious perspective comes out moreso about halfway in -- likely intentionally for a more meaningful character arc.

This is a fantastic set-up with a mercurial magical creature who is unbelievably foul and dangerous one moment and somewhat thoughtful and sensitive the next. But there aren't enough examples of the Tooth Fairy's foreknowledge and other powers, and its whole deal is never explained -- nor does Sam ever bother to ask about its origins and motivations in all the years it's in his life. Granted, his first question to it -- \\"are you a boy or a girl\\" -- is met with such venomous hatred and the threat that \\"You ask me that again and I'll bite your face off. I mean it,\\" one can understand his hesitation to probe further. But when he gets to the point that he's having astronomy lessons and sex with it, you'd think it would come up. There is way too much focus on sex and masturbation, and the parts about Sam and his friends and the girl they're all interested were pretty boring once I realized it all wasn't really going anywhere. You'd think the three friends would be more deeply bonded, Sam having saved one from murder and the other from sodomy (both with the help of the Tooth Fairy). But though they remain close, there's no real sense that their connection is as meaningful as it should be.	2005-01-28

This produces major physical, psychological and political repercussions on a global level. But the scientist who ran the experiment, Lloyd, only seems to feel a passing guilt for causing mass tragedy (death and destruction from accidents that took place when everyone lost consciousness; people suicidal over their futures). There's not a lot of introspection into his lack of guilt, or, conversely, any investigation into the god complex he would likely get sucked into. Instead, he's inordinately worried about whether or not he should marry his fiancee given that he saw himself with someone else in 20 years.<br /><br />Much of the rest of the book similarly focuses on the mundane concerns of the not-very-interesting protagonists and fringe players: Lloyd's partner Theo becomes obsessed with preventing his murder that's 21 years away -- while that's not mundane, it's not that interesting to anyone except Theo; another scientist is just happy to learn that in two decades he gets laid -- this doesn't bring comic relief to the story, and just undercuts any grander implications. Speaking of grander implications -- there aren't many. There's no true, visceral emotion to the book, and no sense that anybody has learned anything. And ~~~~~ SPOILER AHEAD ~~~~~ the fact that Lloyd actually wants to be immortal, floating in a robo-body above the Earth, watching it disintegrate, doomed to hover around the cosmos for eternity while just about everyone else has been dead for millions of years, sounds like an unthinkable horror rather than a euphoric fantasy.	2004-10-27

Not very scary (the cover image is misleadingly ominous) but quite interesting, especially re: unusual phenomena such as apports that couldn't have existed (e.g. a pristine newspaper from 1933, which suddenly appeared under the porch where it hadn't been before, and quickly aged in the days after being found) and a lamp that flashed morse code (\\"SOS,\\" natch). A well-articulated and calmly documented account that provides new insights into ghostly phenomena.	2004-09-17

Yet again, foreknowledge is used to win sporting events and pick stocks without even a cursory comment on the clich&eacute; nature of the scheme and little concern for ethics. \\"Replay\\" is an endless drone of fortune-building and ill-advised romances that inevitably can't make the character happy, but with little insight into the philosophical implications. He never seems to learn how to live life -- only how not to live it.<br /><br />Promise of a number of other 'replayers' and an explanation of the phenomenon didn't pan out. Absolutely nothing in the way of period detail save for citing the films and car models of the times. It's one thing to imply that reliving one's life is tedious; it's another to make the experience of reading about it tedious.	2004-09-14

The protagonist behaves like a particularly annoying adolescent and seems to get little out of his travels through the decades and centuries other than endless onanistic booty calls. Compiling a two-and-a-half-page list of pivotal historical events prefaced by \\"I saw\\" and \\"I was there for\\" is unfathomably lazy and does an extreme disservice to the potential of the setup. And had H.G. Wells read \\"The Man Who Folded Himself\\" and \\"The Time Traveler's Wife,\\" he would scramble to use the timebelt to excise from his memory the fact that modern-day authors seem to find the best use of limitless chronological possibilities is to have sex with one's self. It all devolves into a bleak \\"Outer Limits\\" scenario that would be depressing were the book and its characters capable of engendering anything more than apathy.	2004-09-13

However, the characters are not all that compelling. The fact that when we meet the chrono-challenged protagonist, he's in his 40s, is named Henry and is hanging around his future wife while she's still in grade school doesn't do much to engender the charismatic, seductive persona the author obviously intended given that Henry's cardinal traits are a souped-up sex drive and a tendency to name-drop the cool bands he likes. Clare has promise as a strong, sensual, intellectual artist but winds up defining herself by constantly waiting for a man who doesn't seem all that worth waiting for. And without exciting leads, all the time-traveling, limited as it is to the scope of Henry and Clare's own small lives and fraught with restrictions and inconveniences, ultimately elicits a \\"so what\\"?	2004-09-08

They don't even start to move in till page 101, prior to which they've spent 100 pages talking about moving in, complaining about city life and digressing into irrelevant '70s horniness. After they finally settle in, the wife spends all her time cleaning and the husband and son sit around being boring. As Count Floyd would exclaim unconvincingly, \\"It's so scary it'll...knock the socks...right off of your feet.\\" ~~~~ SPOILER AHEAD: ~~~~ Why does the house need to suck the souls of its inhabitants to restore itself to pristine condition? The renters are cleaning it anyway as part of the agreement. It seems like one call to Molly Maids could save everyone a lot of trouble and eternal damnation.	2004-09-08

Things get off to a rocky start as the author insists on spelling his name with eccentric capitalizations and makes reference to his titular coined phrase so often one can't help but think of an Almighty Deity with a facial tic. I was surprised to find that this is more a self-help book than a compendium of coincidences, but what Mr. Rushnell advises is worthwhile, in spite of a somewhat cloyingly ingenuous tone.<br /><br />It's a smaller book than I expected -- 162 pages sized 5.25\\" x 7.25\\" -- though not quite \\"Who Moved My Cheese\\"-egregious, with its wee dimensions and giant type (and remedial psych blather, but that's another review).	2004-09-08

Some intriguing ideas, but most end just when they're getting somewhat interesting. It felt like the short-story format was a cop-out for writers who couldn't flesh out a full narrative or really dig into the past or the future beyond a superficial description. (BTW, the stripe of paint on the house in \\"Palimpsest Day\\" seemed very familiar -- does anybody remember this being in another story, but to cooler effect?)<br /><br />~Addendum, 9/17/04: Thanks much to Hilary for IDing Jack Finney's \\"I'm Scared,\\" from his excellent short story collection \\"About Time,\\" as the origin of the timeslipped paint stripe concept.	2004-08-14
