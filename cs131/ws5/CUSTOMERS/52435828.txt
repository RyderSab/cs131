Reading Goodbye Gutenberg was a very different experience for me.  I have long grown accustomed to the black and white print where the only changes on a page are the margins and font size.  Kirschenbaum's book is certainly out of the mold and a call to consider what the future of book printing will be. <br /> <br />As I watch my children read now, I see their favorite books changing from colors and graphics to the same old bland print I have been reading from for years.  As the change is made, I see them going from reading for pleasure as a first choice to music, movies and video games being a preferred relaxation activity.  Can it be that the books changing to dull \\"imagery\\" are having a negative effect on their joy for reading?  Both children read in the 98 percentile or higher level for their age group and long trips have always been taken while they read.  This summer, the change occurred where reading wasn't the best way to pass the miles.  I don't think this is simple coincidence, especially after reading this book. <br /> <br />While I do agree with one reviewer that the writing can be repetitious and, to some degree, condescending, I find the book overall to be fascinating and thought-provoking as to what the future of books will be. <br /> <br />Congratulations Valerie.	2005-01-24

His writing combines a great deal of thought provoking ideas and conspiracy theories.<BR>Digital Fortress is about a computer genius gone mad.  You've heard the story before and this one follows the pattern.  However, if you enjoy the technological aspects of the book, you will enjoy the storyline also.  It's a fun read and one that will entertain you for a few hours but don't expect anything new.	2004-02-07

If you haven't read Albom's first book, this one will hit you right between the eyes.  If you've read Tuesdays with Morrie, you'll be prepared for Five People.  Other reviewers have laid out the premise of the book.  Let me tell you what I think will happen to you.  First, this will likely be a book you read and re-read.  It's a keeper that will occupy a prime spot on your bookshelf because it will make you think...and think some more.  Albom has a quality of making you read about others and reflecting on yourself without pushing his writing as another self-help manual.  It's a cute story, a parable I suppose, that has you thinking about the relationships you have, have had or wish you had.  It then spurs you to think how you should improve or revive those relationships.  <BR>If you have or have ever had a relationship you wanted to be better, read Five People and you will be challenged, encouraged and very likely delighted to act on that desire.  If you find your attitude headed the wrong direction, the ideas from this book will help you to change your outlook.  If you think your job doesn't matter, this will help you understand why almost anything you do is worthwhile to someone.<BR>This is a must-have book.  I rank it in the top-10 of any contemporary book I have read.	2004-01-12

I simply couldn't put it down.  You probably know the basics of the story if you've read the publisher's review.  It's another suspense-thriller, this time wrapped in the ancient secrets of religion.  The book is a thrill ride for the first half and then becomes somewhat predictable, but still fun.  At times, I felt I was watching a soap opera where you can miss several days and still know what is happening.  At the same time, I couldn't quit reading it because I was pulling for the hero.  I predicted the finish and imagine most readers do but would still recommend the book as a pleasurable read to anyone.<br />What I most enjoyed about the book is how it covers topics I'd heard about but know very little about.  It seems the author did plenty of research and through that, has pushed me to begin doing my own research.  If you are interested in religious history at all, you will enjoy reading this book and likely be challenged to learn more about the past.	2004-01-01

This may be one of the best books on leadership I have ever read.  It certainly rang a chord within me and has prompted me to begin a leadership training program at my job using some of the examples from this book as the basis.<BR>The Servant is a story of a ragged businessman having trouble in his personal and professional life.  He's on the edge emotionally, mentally and spiritually.  (Sound like anyone you know?)  He winds up at a program in a monestary and finds one of his teachers to be a former Wall Street hot-shot executive.  He initially works diligently to find the secret to instant success from the former Wall Streeter but learns that true leadership, true success comes from giving, not getting; from being a servant instead of being served.  As you might know, Jesus is the model for servant leadership and the thesis of the book is based on principles illustrated by Christ while on earth.  <BR>Whether you are a Christian believer or not, the stories and principles found here are beneficial and can help you be a better person/boss/employer/husband/father.  If you really want to find out what the top of the ladder is like, read The Servant.  It will help you climb every step of the way.	2003-08-31

Everyone Dies is my first Michael McGarrity book and the start of a new series I will be reading.  I don't know how this guy has stayed below the radar but this book is as good as any I've read in this genre.<BR>Everyone Dies is the latest Kevin Kearney novel, Kearney being the main figure of the book and the series.  In this book, killings in Santa Fe ruin a good vacation for Kearney, the Police Chief.  At first, the killings don't seemed link but Kearney finally finds out that he, his pregnant wife and his son's family are on the death list.  What ensues is a mad dash to find the killer and save his family from their destruction.<BR>I think what makes the story so good is that Kearney isn't some daring, dashing hero but just a guy who is looking forward to retirement and moving to his little ranch.  He has a rather bizarre marriage as his wife is in the military and stationed in another location, he has a son he only recently learned about and has a down-home quality that makes him the guy you invite over to dinner so he doesn't have to eat alone in some greasy diner.<BR>The action in the story is always moving.  The characters are added on the fly and he doesn't bog you down in mundane details.  However, when he describes locations and settings in the book, you can easily picture them, especially if you've visited the parts of the country he is describing.  <BR>The only thing I didn't understand in the book was the need to address a gay character and gay community.  It doesn't add to the book so I question why McGarrity would find the need to address it.<BR>That said, I have begun my quest to go back to Tularosa and catch up with Kevin Kearney and his travels, pitfalls and career up to Everybody Dies.  Pick this book up and you'll have travel putting it down until you are done.	2003-08-31

While many books scratch the surface of management and other delve into the minute details, Blanchard and his co-writers deliver practical, useable ideas in a common-sense manner that will allow the brightest of managers see new insights and the newest of managers see the bigger picture of the challenges ahead of them.  <BR>The story is told in parable format, similar to Raving Fans and Gung Ho (two books referred to within LBTB), which allows Blanchard, et al. to tell the story of a hard-charging businessman who had built a solid foundation for his direction and effort and had lost his way getting caught up in the fever of big business and big EGO.  I'm confident most managers can identify with some of the mistakes made by Michael, the good guy that gets turned around, has a heart attack and finds his way back.  The heart attack is symbolic of what often confronts leaders that allows them to see the wrong choices they make that are casued by EGO or other motivators that are not aligned with the idea espoused in this book called servant leadership.<BR>You have to read this book.  I am leading a leadership program at work and this book is the capstone of the program.  Buy it and get a copy for all your employees who are in the position of leadership, whether in management positions or line positions.	2003-08-03

Wrong.  While it takes much longer to become a good manager, the tiny minutes in a day gives us ample opportunity to manage people for positive results.  This book isn't rocket science.  It's written in Ken Blanchard's sensible, easy to read parable format that makes it as much fun to read as it is insightful.  Managers, whether aspiring, new or old-hands will find something that challenges them to be better working with their people.  I suggest you make it required reading for your management staff.	2003-08-03

The plan is executed to military perfection and almost works.  Why doesn't it?  Someone else is controlling what happens but who?

I've heard many good things about Turow's writing and enjoyed Reversible Errors.  As a Grisham fan, I compare everything to his legal stories and thought Reversible Errors kept me bound to the story almost as well as Grisham does.  Depending on your tastes, the sexual elements of Reversible Errors can be a turn-off but the legal story and the characters are easy to get into.  If this is not his best work, I really look forward to reading more because this book is worth the time and money.	2003-02-23

Another two day read from Grisham that kept me up way too late wanting to get the whole story in.<BR>This is a good tale of rags-to-riches-to-rags; of legal abuse and using the system; of good boy goes bad.  <BR>The main character toils on public service to indigent cases in need of protection and then eats the forbidden fruit on his way to wealth.  Along the way, money clouds his judgement and his motives.  I found myself both pulling for him to come out good in the end and to get what was coming to him for abusing the judicial system.  In the end, he gets a little of both; something he wants and something he had.<BR>If you like Grisham, you'll enjoy Torts.  It might not be his best...but it's better than most.	2003-02-23

The story is centered around the main characters research firm working on nano-technology development.  However, he gets lured into chasing a memory from the past that could ruin his future.  The story ends up centered more around on-line prostitution, murder and haunting memories than science and what nano-technology holds in store for us (see Prey) but it keeps the story moving and enticing.  The story ends with somewhat of a surprise, but not too surprising if you piece it all together.<BR>While Bosch fans might be disappointed, most readers will enjoy Chasing the Dime.	2003-02-09

By using the common sense approach to discipling your children, you will eliminate the negative time to small points in time while giving you the opportunity to spend a great deal of time in a positive and rewarding relationship with your child(ren).  This is a must read for any parent.  The things that we often know but won't believe are possible are possible.  I have started following the advice given in this book more regulary and I can already see one of my children turning the corner in how she sees herself and her actions and how the two are not necessarily the same.<BR>Give this book as a gift to yourself and anyone else you know willing to learn how to be a better, happier and more successful parent.	2002-05-25

Kids and family are hardly mentioned. The first divorce is explained and it's just what you expect. His first love is his job. That's great if that's what you want out of life. For me, it's a waste of time. There's little relevant information here for the person not wanting to climb the corporate ladder for the sake of climbing the corporate ladder. People like this must be needed to run the huge companies but it's not much of a commentary on someone's life. Welch was in the right place at the right time, had a knack for using other people in the right places, didn't flinch when they didn't meet his needs and clawed his way to the top. Somehow, reading this, I don't get the idea he did it as neatly or cleanly as it comes across in the book. There were people out to get him but he never appears to fight back, except with his superior intellect and skill. Yeah, right.<BR>The book is OK but if your brain is on at all, you figure it out in the first two chapters.  The last half is just about the deals &quot;he&quot; pulled off.  Little is given in way of a case study or explanation that will benefit anyone.  It's just a rehash of the glory days.<BR>There are better books on the market for history, biography or improving your abilities.	2002-05-07

I think this is a book that would have a better message with fewer pages.  It seems the author sometimes begins to ramble in his stories looking for space filling material instead of staying focused simply on the message.  However, the next to last chapter does stay on target and is some of the best, most inspirational reading I've had in some time.<br />Just Like Jesus takes you from the here and now to a view of eternity.  Can you be like Jesus?  Well, no one can be perfect but Jesus demonstrated so many qualities and traits that anyone should be willing to emulate to be like Jesus.  Afterall, Jesus now lives in heaven and isn't that where we want to be?  We want to be just like Jesus...living with God and in a wonderful place.  To do that, we must also try to emulate what Jesus was while He was on earth.  Through this book, Lucado shows us some of the qualities we can attain to...if we desire.<br />While this may not be the best book I've read, it's certainly worth reading if you are on a spiritual quest to follow Christ.	2002-04-07

This was my first Lucado book to read and I now understand why he sells so many books.  Traveling Light is based on Psalm 23, surely one of the most well-known passages of the Bible.  My grandmother helped my memorize it and recite it every time I stayed at her house and reading the book brought back a swarm of good memories.  On top of that, Lucado's writing about and through the passages brought a feeling of peace over me that has been missing for some time.  I struggle with carrying my baggage, forgetting that God wants to help.  Traveling Light means packing your faith and little else.  I plan to read all of Lucado's books by the end of the year based on reading this one.<br />Unfortunately, I did find one obstacle with a theological conflict I have with what Lucado had written.  That caused me to give 4 stars instead of 5.  Because of my belief on baptism and grace, I worry that someone who hasn't developed a strong faith and understanding of the Word might miss a point I believe to be very important.  Saying that, I realize not all Christians (and writers) agree on every topic and that much good can be done by showing the love of God that is brought forth in this book.	2002-03-27

Nothing here is new except the people who get killed.  People should read this book if 1) they want to know more about the capabilities of the military, 2) they want to learn a little more about what happens around the world, 3) the just enjoy plain old action adventures.  Stay away from the book if fair writing and extreme use of foul language bothers you.  I would prefer Marcinko to quit making asides to his editor during the story.  It only seems to help fill up pages.  I would also prefer he stay within the action once it starts and identifies people and past events within another part of the book.  Once the the hunter is after the prey and the killing begins, stay there.  I find myself jumping through some passages just to stay on track with what is happening.<BR>Marcinko will give you a slight sense of the fast-paced action of war and will give you an appreciation for those who still wish to make men of war within our military instead of trying to make the military a social club.  I think future books will be even better based on the current status of our country and President Bush's attack attitude favored by Marcinko.	2001-12-10

While much of the books are fiction, there is also a great deal of understanding you can receive on what the military has the capability to do.  I read this latest book after the 9.11.01 attack because I appreciate Marcinko's patriotism and desire to create warriors in the military.  It seems to be the job of military shoul be to protect and defend, sometimes be being offensive.  The two negatives I have towards his more recent books are the increased use of foul language and his use of &quot;insights&quot; of people, places and things during an action sequence in the story.<BR>I understand that the language used in the book is authentic but at what point there seems to be more of it just to reach the number of words appropriate for the book, what's the point?  He also spends more time telling background on people or past events during an action sequence that should either be more concise or placed before the sequence begins.  I find myself skipping over some of the history of his friends to find out what is happening in the present.<BR>I will look forward to future books, especially in light of the bombings and the American response and hope that Marcinko will return to a more direct type of story-telling that will encourage us to create and support men of war.	2001-12-10

That may be the best word to describe Ken Blanchard's recent book, High Five. It's typically written and, as typical for Blanchard, easy to comprehend the point he is trying to make. The story is one of a displaced (fired) Alan Foster, a great performer but horrible team member. Foster has the incorrect notion that individual production is more important than company performance. Too often, people in business and sports begin to believe their production is essential to the team when in fact there production is breaking down the team. High Five takes you into the concept of teamwork with a look at Alan Foster's fifth grade son and his hockey team. They are the cellar dwellers and with good reason...no teamwork. With the help of an aged woman and a bit of introspection, Foster helps turn a band of underachievers into a team worthy of a championship. As a coach of elementary-aged students and a manager of people, High Five is a helpful, instructional tale that will benefit me greatly in both roles. There's a reason for the terms &quot;team sports&quot; and &quot;sports teams&quot;. Football, basketball, hockey, baseball, soccer...they are all driven by a team. Michael Jordan is a great example of a star who shined the brightest when he adapted his individual talents to the goals and values of the team. This same concept works in your company, in your department and in your office. To beat the competition, it takes everyone working together...as a team. Ken Blanchard continues to underwhelm me with his style and overwhelm me with his message. You'll be a Raving Fan for teamwork when you read High Five.	2001-03-20

Based on three simple principles (Decide, Discover, Deliver), each company has created a group of Raving Fans (not just customers, but fans) who wouldn't consider shopping anywhere else for what one of these companies offers.  Within each story is other nuggets of common sense and good ideas that can be implemented in any company that has customers and wants to create fans.   We required our store managers to read the book and each created a list ranging from 20-40 points that they can put into effect at their stores to improve customer service.

His fight is to stay alive and return to his new love.  <br />McCarthy's writing has the ability to make you feel you are listening to John Grady Cole tell his story.  McCarthy's decision to use the uneducated grammar patterns of a youngster from West Texas and his ability to describe both feelings and impressions leave you seeing the trails Cole rides and imaging the people he is fighting for and against.  <br />McCarthy's writing style and the story itself makes it easy to understand why this book won national awards.  It's easier still to understand why everyone will enjoy reading this great story of a young man growing up painfully hard and fast.	2001-01-07

This is a book about McGuane's experience with horses through his life.  It gives an interesting and entertaining look into the life of an active horse owner.  McGuane has been fortunate to have the life he describes in the book and calls for an appreciation the horse has played and continues to play in our lives.  From ranch work to modern day cutting competitions, horses and their mark on the West live in both fantasy and reality for many people.  McGuane's book brings depth and definition to dreams we have of using and working with horses.  The horse is an interesting creature, often weighing 10 times the rider but still at the rider's command.  If you have a horse or dream of having a horse, Some Horses will give you a respect and appreciation for why horses are important to us.	2000-12-06

The Corporate Coach is a good book for all would-be and new managers. The book reinforces the idea that a manager is not so much a boss as a supporter of his employees. Every company should hope that each manager understands he has employees entrusted to him and he must be able to maximize their effectiveness. To do this, the manager must be able to be a supporter, a cheerleader and a corrector of problems in an atmosphere that is positive. The Corporate Coach explains all of this from the know-how of someone who has done it and proven it's success. I give it to all my new managers to read.	2000-12-01

Learning to focus on what you do and who you are will allow you the opportunity to succeed. Lack of focus on who you are causes you to be inefficient whereas discipline of focus will cause you to focus on the needs of your customer and your strengths to meet their needs.	2000-12-01

Who Moved My Cheese? is a simple book and that is what makes it great.  The story is simple and the principle is simple. You must accept change and adapt to it to change.  Profound? No! Insightful into the problems of most people? YES! The reason this simple book works is because most people working in your company or factory think simply. They are not deep thinkers that desire to understand the workings and mechanics of your business. They want to do their job and get a paycheck. The fact is, most of them are scared when their job or environment changes and being able to bring that fear down to the simple observations found in the book can and will help them. This book is not for the great business leaders of our day or the business leaders (and book reviewers) who believe they are great.  It is for the people who believe that life is simple and simple principles are the best and easiest to guide their lives.  I recommend it to everyone.	2000-11-29

This book helps ease the process by providing some great questions to ask job candidates. The book also begins with some great information on planning and preparing for an interview.  The adage &quot;a failure to plan is a plan to fail&quot; is never more true than when you are trying to hire good employees. If you don't think your employees are the key to your success, you are fooling yourself and asking good questions that will require some thought-provoking answers is a big step forward. The only weakness of the book is that it doesn't explain how to interpret answers but I'm not sure any book could do that. If you ask the right questions, you'll soon learn the acceptable responses and this book is a GREAT tool for asking the question.	2000-11-29

One of the toughest duties of running or managing a small or mid-size company is keeping good staff, especially those with jobs on the lower end of the pay scale.  Lauer advocates starting with a plan and then hiring the  right people and then training them.  Far too many companies hire warm  bodies and expect they can train them to be outstanding.  Lauer points out  the fallacy in that idea and explains why doing what is necessary to hire  great candidates puts a company far ahead of others.  Lauer also suggests  several ways to keep good employees and teaches you how to terminate  employees without causing you or the employee an excessive amount of  grief.<br />I bought copies for all my managers.  You should too.	1999-01-15
