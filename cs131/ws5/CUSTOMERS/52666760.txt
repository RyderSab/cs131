US	52666760	R1RUFOWP1NTJ04	0786918640	212898559	The Temple of Elemental Evil (Greyhawk Classics)	Books	3	1	3	N	N	"The dead priest's fingers still twitched, ...	...perhaps struggling even in death to finish the casting that could not be completed in life.\\" <br />The Temple of Elemental Evil starts off incredibly well (i.e. with the twins!), but then all of a sudden there is a blunder; Iuz, the Demigod, communicates with his high priest through \\"a small bell sitting upon his writing desk\\" (???) pp 2.  I did not know that deities used bells to inform their clerics that it was time for communication... <br />This is just an early example of the many mistakes made throughout the book.   <br />In addition, the writing is rather poor and the dialogues could have been a lot better. <br />To start with, Lanithaine's death took place as if he were a novice, a first level character (!!!); one arrow (!!!) was enough to dispose of the veteran wizard? Hmmm...  After serving with the original group that assaulted (and defeated) the forces of Evil ten years back, this was hardly the death this character deserved.  Sacrificing himself against Lareth/Hedrack or to seal the portal to the demoness Zuggtmoy or to destroy her altogether would have been a much more likely and heroic death.   <br />In the first third of the book, there is too much of Shanhaevel thinking to himself about everything and anything, over and over...  It becomes tiring, not to mention annoying! <br />Moreover, though adopted by a human at a young age, Shanhaevel, is not very elf-like; the way he carries himself, the way he thinks and acts.  A human would be more suited for the role.  Why did Shanhaevel have to be an elf if he was not going to be anything like an elf? <br />Also, did his master not have his spellbook with him when he died, for Shanhaevel to take after his death?  What about magical items?  His master had ventured into the Temple ten years ago and he doesn't have as much as a ring to show for it?  Just his horse??? <br />In addition, the conversation/dialogue that follows Melias' fall is laden with romance and drama better suited to a lame soap opera andnot the novelization of one of the best modules of all time!  The elf, who is behaving more \\"irrationally\\" than a human, and has close to no elven personality traits is acting/behaving like a love struck teenager who cannot tell when it is time for romance and when it is time for business/ serious work, not to mention that he is way too insecure and eager to \\"make friends,\\" as if he were \\"special...\\" <br />On page 130, the paladin says \\"I like the idea of waiting\\" rather than exploring the barn house and seeking out a possible secret passage into the Temple! That was the PALADIN talking, ... when those are words expected from the thief!  <br />Moreover, on the same page the party of six is divided in half with ALL the warriors inside the barn house, and the spellcasters with the thief located outside, as if they were morons; the first rule of adventuring is ALWAYS to provide your spellcasters with defensive muscle.  <br />Furthermore, \\"In his estimation, there were possibly a hundred or more, plus maybe a total of dozen ogres, trolls, and even what looked like a giant.\\" pp151-152 <br />By the time the six companions were done with them (!!!) with regular arrows, one fireball, one sleep spell, one stinking cloud and one lightning bolt, \\"the few left alive were fleeing into the woods\\" (???)  pp160  Is there something wrong with the picture here?   <br />The chances of a human priest (Lareth) worshipping Lolth are slim indeed, as for the Spider Queen herself accepting a MALE and a HUMAN are way less than slim! <br />As for the romance it just did not feel right; it was rather forced.   <br />On page 247 there is the cherry on the cake: Shirral and Shanhaevel making out in the midst of battle with skeletons and ogres all about!  Mercy... <br />Furthermore, as other readers have also pointed out, the characters have \\"bonded\\" way too soon. <br /> <br />On the positive side, what with the AMAZING cover art and the bedroom scene with the twins, the book opens with a bang,immediately catching the reader's interest and attention. <br />Thomas M. Reid has done a FANTASTIC job of keeping a balance between what is suitable to young readers and what to adults! Subtle, and not so subtle, hints is exactly what many of us fans out there who are now in our 30's would like to see more of-something a bit more spicy than the usual.  In short, Mika and Astelle steal the show! <br />Moreover, there is great use of familiar spells throughout the book, thus boosting interest, while the thief's humor is refreshing. <br />In conclusion, there is the great quote on page 252 \\"Our sorrow at committing even the lesser evil is what separates us from evil.\\" <br /> <br />Though the potential for a great book was definitely there it fails to take off.  A shame really... Nevertheless, Thomas M. Reid does a FANTASTIC job of establishing a cliffhanger for a sequel. <br />In a nutshell, it's an ok book, and that's about it; it lacks that extra something to put it over the top.  No masterpiece here... <br />	2005-02-07
US	52666760	R3JO13L9SK6FTY	0786901918	388174109	Curse of the Shadowmage (Forgotten Realms-The Harpers, No 11)	Books	4	2	3	N	N	"Behold the King of Shadows"	Curse of the Shadowmage is the eleventh book in the Forgotten Realms Harpers series and the sequel to the Crypt of the Shadowking.  Caledan Caldorien finds himself trying to overcome the same curse that has afflicted his ancestor eons ago.  Mari Al'maren, together with several of Caledan's old adventuring companions from the Fellowship of the Dreaming Dragon, and some new allies, set out to save their friend. <br />Slightly better than the first book, Curse of the Shadowmage is very well written, with the reader feeling that they have been transported to another universe and are actually present among the characters, seeing what they see, feeling what they feel, sensing what they sense.   <br /> <br />On the negative side, ENOUGH with the author portraying the Harpers as being oppressive, twisting the arms of their members and making them carry out their instructions while suppressing their free will etc!  Last time I checked, the Harpers were the heroes keeping the Realms from falling under the sway of Evil!  K'shar, who in the end, supposedly \\"saw the light\\" and turned stag is portrayed as the \\"hero\\" who \\"breaks free\\" of the Harpers (???).  Is there something wrong with the picture here?  All right, let's do away with hierarchy and the chain of command, and have the agents vote whether they want to take a specific assignment!!!  That will work... <br />Moreover, the Shadowstar and the Shadevari are too similar to J.R.R. Tolkien's One Ring and the Nazgul respectively. <br />In addition, WAY too many characters are \\"coming back from the dead\\" to the point that it is getting tiring/annoying... <br />Furthermore, on page 309 (the last page in the book) the author states \\"Now Kellen was the last person in the world with shadow magic.\\"  That is just not true as Richard Baker will show in The Shadow Stone, unless that was the case for a very short period of time. <br /> <br />Aside from that it's a pretty good book; the plot, the writing and the characters are very wellthought out and presented!  <br />The story of the Shadevari, Azuth, and the creation of the world, along with the Shadowstar, (Pp242) is GREAT. <br />K'shar is a FASCINATING character who deserves a whole book (at least) all to himself.  <br />Finaly, there is some very witty humor between Cormick and Jewel. <br /> <br />Other books I would recommend from the Harpers Series include Red Magic, Parched Sea, The Veiled Dragon, Elfshadow and Elfsong to mention a few. <br />	2005-02-04

Together with Mari Al'maren, an active Harper, and his old adventuring companions from the Fellowship of the Dreaming Dragon, he sets out to spoil the villain's plans. <br />The book is very well written, and the reader feels that they have been transported to another universe and are actually present among the characters, seeing what they see, feeling what they feel, sensing what they sense.   <br /> <br />On the negative side, HOW did a city like Iriaebor, City of a Thousand Spires, fall so easily and quietly under the control of the Zhentarim and WHY did the city's prominent/powerful citizens not put up so much as a fight for over a year, when it was evident as to who Lord Ravendas was, not to mention the presence of Zhents among (actually dominating) the military/city guard? <br />Moreover, where is the outside intervention that would surely come if and when a city the caliber of Iriaebor ever fell to the Black Network?  Crusades would be undertaken to expel the Keep's agents from the City. <br />The only resistance comes from a Thieves' Guild and the Harpers, with the latter using \\"green\\" Mari, and \\"uncooperative\\" Calderon? <br /> <br />By no means does this make Curse of the Shadowmage a bad book; the plot, the writing and the characters are very well thought out and presented!  <br />The story of Verraketh, the sorcerer, who becomes the Shadowking, along with the Nightstone, with which he \\"meant to gain sway over the spirits of men and bring countless realms under his dire rule\\" (Pp150) are GREAT. <br />Moreover, the Shadevar was an interesting addition to the story. <br />Zhents, assassins, love, duty, honor, bravery, magic, and swordfights are all about.   <br />Strongly recommended along with Mark Anthony's Curse of the Shadowmage, which is the sequel to Crypt of the Shadowking, as well as The Shadow Stone by Richard Baker for a good dose of Shadow Magic. <br />	2005-01-22

The Ultimate Helm is the sixth and last book in the Cloakmaster Cycle series.  Picking up from where The Broken Sphere left off, the book sheds light on Teldin Moore during the last stretch of his quest, this time ABOARD the Spelljammer.    Teldin's changes have reached their peak; His close proximity to the Spelljammer has amplified/boosted the Cloak's powers, and subsequently Teldin emerges as a powerful fighter/wizard.  He is now able to dispatch neogi, umber hulks, and illithids among others, with great ease all the while being able to cast powerful spells such as teleport spells.    The plot as a whole is EXCELLENT!  The whole concept of the Citadel with its garrisons and its diverse populace is very original.      In addition, the book is so incredibly well written and presented that the reader feels that they have been transported to another plane of existence and are actually present among the characters, seeing what they see, feeling what they feel, sensing what they sense.  Moreover, Russ Howard does a great job of presenting the distinct culture and civilization of the spacefaring peoples.  He has done a great deal of research in order to provide such an accurate and lucid description of these people.  It's all here: Illithids, Neogi, Umber Hulks, Elves, Half-Elves, Gnomes, Kender, Arcane, Beholders, Orcs, Scro, Goblins, Dracons, Minotaurs, Ogres, Undead (banshees/zombies etc), Master Liches, Halflings, Dwarves, Gnolls, Gith, Hill Giants, Centaurs, Pirates, Tanar'ri, even the Shou.    Furthermore, there are some new and interesting races/creatures like the Kasharin (beholder-mummies), the guardian Shivaks, and the magnificent Spaakiil.    The story of the original forgotten Unhuman War involving the evil Sh'tarrgh, the Spaakiil, the Lovokei, the Kutalla, the Broul, and the Juna was BREATHTAKING!      What was also AMAZING was the material presented in Chapter 30 (pp245-252), describing such events as the destruction of the One Sphere, Ouiyan.    Other FASCINATING points included: the clash between The Alliance of the Cloak (Humans, Dwarves, Halflings, Gith, Elves) and The Beholder Alliance (Beholders, Ogres, Minotaurs, Hill Giants), the fact that the three-pointed star represents the sun-Aeyenna, the forgotten captains imprisoned in the Dark Tower-Jokarin, Theorx, and Miark, and many, many more...  History, magic, love, honor, duty, intrigue, betrayal, swordfights, and space battles are all about.  This book has it all and more!    My only reservation was in relation to page 183, where the author talks about an elven guard with a \\"thick white mustache\\" (!!!).  I believe elves do not have facial hair.    The Ultimate Helm provides more than a worthy conclusion to the series.  Everything comes full circle.  All the loose ends are dealt with efficiently and successfully.  In short, it is by far the BEST of the six books.    The Cloakmaster Cycle series would, without a doubt, make a GREAT set of films.  In addition, the books should be re-published and re-released as part of one large hardcover tome along the lines of the Cleric Quintet, the Drizzt saga or the Dragonlance trilogies.    In conclusion, the author establishes a GREAT cliffhanger for adding yet another book to the series, this time with the smalljammer.    Why did Russ Howard not write any more Spelljammer or even other TSR/WoTC books along the lines of the Ultimate Helm?	2005-01-16

His quest takes him and his companions from the City of Portals to the Outlands and the Gate-Town of Curst, to the Lower Planes of Baator and Carceri, and even to the Inner Plane of Negative Energy. <br /> <br />The plot as a whole is excellent!  The book is so incredibly well written and presented that the reader feels that they have been transported to another plane of existence and are actually present among the characters, seeing what they see, feeling what they feel, sensing what they sense.  Moreover, Ray and Valerie Vallese do a great job of presenting the distinct cultures and civilizations of the inhabitants of Planescape.   <br />This has, without a doubt, been achieved as a result of a great deal of research that has gone into learning and understanding the numerous and often complex characteristics of the Planescape multiverse.  Subsequently, the authors have a firm grasp of vital factual knowledge, and in turn have succeeded in providing an accurate and lucid description of these peoples.  <br />Tieflings, Baatezu, Tanar'ri, Devas, Bariaurs, Zombies, Shadows, Hags, Githzerai, and factions like the Sensates, the Harmonium, and the Doomguard have been very well presented. <br />The story, the dialogues, the details are all wonderful, and create a strong sense of mystery and anticipation. <br />Intrigue, betrayal, and swordfights are all about. <br />The cherry on the cake is the actual ending, which is totally unexpected! <br /> <br />In short, Torment is what a Planescape book SHOULD be like! <br /> <br />It is strongly recommended to both general Fantasy as well as Planescape enthusiasts along with the Blood Wars Trilogy-Blood Hostages, Abyssal Warriors, and Planar Powers, and the Lady of Pain novel. <br />Sadly these are all the Planescape novels that have been published so far. <br />Hopefully, a sequel will be written shedding light as to what comes next, since the demand for one is definitely there.   <br /> <br />MORE PLANESCAPE BOOKS PLEASE!!! <br /> <br />PS One should seriously start thinking about turning this book into a movie... <br />	2005-01-08

The Glass Prison deals with a familiar part of the Realms: the lands between the Thunder Peaks and Tilverton (the wildlands on the eastern border of Cormyr).  The book sheds light on Vheod, a Cambion out of Broken Reach, a city found on the Outer Plane of the Abyss, as he copes with his evil nature and tries to overcome its inherent evil.  He teams up with Melann, a human priestess of Chauntea and her warrior brother Whitlock in search of a Balor, named Chare'en, who threatens the region and possesses the key to lifting the curse that has been plaguing their family for generations.    On the positive side, the book is very well written, and the plot as a whole is excellent.   Moreover, the main hero, Vheod (Thief/Fighter/Wizard Pp144), is an interesting character.   In addition, my favorite part of the book was the Abyssal story involving the shipwright and Demogorgon, which I thought was great!    On the negative side, there are too many similarities between Vheod and Drizzt Do'Urden.  Moreover, it would have been very helpful to have had \\"flashbacks\\" from Vheod's life and past experiences in his homeworld.  There are some elements of Planescape, though more were needed to get a better feel for the Abyss.       Overall, Monte Cook does a good job of conveying the sheer power of Evil, such as in the case of the Ravenwitch: \\"The thorns dug into his bared flesh so that the ravens' blood flowed down the vines and into his wounds.\\" Pp197  As for Chare'en, \\"Chare'en was the embodiment of anathema.  He was living despair, destruction, and desecration.\\" Pp278      Hopefully, a sequel will be written shedding light as to what comes next.	2004-12-23

The Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting follows in the tradition of the two previous FR Campaign Settings in providing vital information concerning the magical world of Toril.  Ranging from background history, to city and social descriptions, to important people and characters, to the respective gods and pantheons, to adventure hooks and encounter tables, to magical items and artifacts, to new spells and monsters, to maps and specialty classes, this accessory has it all and more! <br />As someone who has been playing Second Edition AD&D since 1989 and has had a difficult time making the transition to Third Edition D&D, I have to say that the FR Campaign Setting, even though is quite expensive, it is still very useful, to the point that it provided me with most of what I needed so as not to feel totally lost.  <br />For the FR enthusiast, like myself, I also strongly recommend both previous editions, which by the way are in boxed set form (they are out of print Second Edition AD&D, and it will take a bit of searching, but it's well worth it).

Picking up from where The Radiant Dragon left off, the book continues to shed light on Teldin Moore and his ongoing quest to find out more about the magical cloak he carries a.k.a. \\"The Cloak of the First Pilot\\" and eventually be free of it. <br />Teldin continues to change both physically and mentally; new haircut-new beard, he is even more cynical etc <br />Ability-wise, he is further maturing, becoming more and more experienced and able as a fighter as well as in learning the secrets of the cloak and thus better able at controlling and handling its immense power.  He is now able to detect magic, to cast the legends lore spell in regards to crystal spheres (!!!), and to read and understand books faster than it takes to get them off the shelves (literally). <br /> <br />The book starts off very slowly and the first 50 pages are rather painful.  After page 80 though, it picks up.   <br />The plot as a whole is excellent!  The book is very well written so that the reader firmly believes that they are there with the characters.  The feelings of anticipation grow as Teldin edges closer and closer to the Spelljammer. <br /> <br />On the negative side, The Broken Sphere is not as good as Nigel Findley's Into Void.  There is less action and much more (too much!) of Teldin thinking to himself about everything and anything over and over and over... <br /> <br />Moreover, ENOUGH with the mole/spy thing, it's yet AGAIN the SAME story!  It's gotten to the point that if there is no mole/saboteur in the next one, it will feel as if something is amiss... <br />  <br />In addition, why did Teldin not keep Hectate???  <br />Firstly, the bionoid was the best navigator Teldin ever had! <br />Secondly, the chemistry/trust between the two was great (both went the extra mile)! <br />Thirdly, Hectate was also a great warrior! <br />Fourthly, the bionoid had stated that he wouldfollow Teldin ANYWHERE! <br />Lastly, The Radiant Dragon ended with the two of them deciding TOGETHER what the next course of action will be, yet when The Broken Sphere begins, Hectate is gone! <br /> <br />In conclusion, Nigel Findley establishes a GREAT cliffhanger for The Ultimate Helm, the next and final book in the series.	2004-09-13

Picking up from where the Maelstrom's Eye left off, the book continues to shed light on Teldin Moore and his ongoing quest to find out more about the magical cloak he carries a.k.a. \\"The Cloak of the First Pilot\\" and eventually be free of it. <br />Teldin continues to change both physically and mentally; the mustache is gone, he is more cynical etc <br />Ability-wise, he is maturing, becoming more and more experienced and able as a fighter as well as in learning the secrets of the cloak and thus better able at controlling and handling its immense power.  He is now able to see through the Spelljammer's eyes and polymorph into a Radiant Dragon that can tow ships to safety. <br />The book also provides more information on the Probe's rescuing of Teldin from the pirates off of Krynn, and the Reigar race to which the fallen she-captain from Beyond the Moons belonged.  In addition, on page 86 we learn that Estriss is LN in gaming terms: \\"Teldin nodded, appreciating the illithid's evenhandedness.  This was more like the Estriss he thought he knew: a being who possessed a strong moral code and a philosophical nature.\\" <br /> <br />The plot as a whole is excellent!  The book is so incredibly well written that the reader feels that they have been transported to another plane of existence and are actually present among the characters, seeing what they see, feeling what they feel, sensing what they sense.  Moreover, Elaine Cunningham does a great job of presenting the distinct culture and civilization of the space faring peoples, especially the elves, the bionoids, and the dracons.  She has done a great deal of research in order to provide such an accurate and lucid description of these people. <br />Arcane, Beholders, Elves, Drow, Illithids, Orcs, Scro, space battles, intrigue, betrayal, and swordfights are all about. <br />In addition, there are several new and interesting races/creatures introduced, such as the Radiant Dragons, the Bionoids, the Dracons, the Lakshu, the terrible Witchlight Marauders, and the Insectares, that really do spice things up. <br />Finally, it is truly wonderful to be provided with so much more information regarding the Spelljamming world.   <br /> <br />On the negative side, there is this ongoing \\"return from the land of the dead\\" theme.  First, there's Gomja who comes back in the previous book, now it's Estriss' turn; the dead should stay dead, unless of course powerful magic is involved such as Raise Dead or Resurrection spells-in both cases, however, neither applies.  What's next?  Are we expected to see Aelfred back in The Broken Sphere, and Sylvie returning in the sixth and last book of the series???  Moreover, the excuse for the mind flayer's survival found on page 67 states that \\"Illithids require less air than humans, and I survived in the void long enough to be rescued by this group from Falx.\\"  Hmmm... <br /> <br />Secondly, Teldin gets \\"charmed,\\" yet AGAIN, (!!!) this time by \\"Raven\\"/Pearl and he remains so for most of the book.   <br /> <br />Thirdly, ENOUGH with the mole/spy thing, and ENOUGH with the \\"I trusted you and you betrayed me\\" thing!  In short, all this repetition is becoming very tiring!!! <br /> <br />Fourthly, Teldin must have a Wisdom score of less than 3 and be a complete moron if he got on a strange and foreign mystery ship that he knew nothing about, especially when he is told that ONLY elves are supposed to fly it, and at the same time two dracons, who he barely knows, are claiming it as their own.  Not to mention that even if elves did run the ship, his common sense should remind him that based on his previous and quite unpleasant experience with spelljamming elves he should flee on first sight, rather than go on board one of their vessels.  Hmmm... <br /> <br />Finally, the deaths of both Grimnosh and Ubiznik took place as if both were mere novices, first level characters.  A more dramatic set of duels could have been used. <br /> <br />Nevertheless, Elaine Cunningham does a FANTASTIC job of conveying the sheer evil and horror of the Witchlight Marauders especially after reading: \\"Once the supply of elven flesh is depleted, the creature and its inevitable offspring will turn on each other.\\" <br /> <br />In conclusion, Elaine Cunningham establishes a GREAT cliffhanger for The Broken Sphere, the next book in the series.	2004-09-09

Shadow Stone deals with a neglected part of the Realms: the Old Empires and specifically the land of Chessenta (located south of the Sea of Fallen Stars).  The book sheds light on Aeron, a commoner out of Maerchlin, a town found within Akanax's sphere of influence, and his quest of fulfilling his lifelong dream of becoming a powerful wizard.      The plot as a whole is excellent.  The book is very well written and the reader feels that they have been transported to another plane of existence and are actually present among the characters, seeing what they see, feeling what they feel, sensing what they sense.  Richard Baker does a fairly good job of presenting the distinct culture and civilization of the peoples of Chessenta, though more research is needed in order to provide a fuller, more accurate and lucid description of the region's inhabitants.  What it comes down to is that the book lacks that strong Ancient Greek style/flavor associated with Chessenta.    On the negative side, the book does have several significant flaws e.g. the king of Akanax is Hippartes (human male LN Fighter 19) not Gormantor.    Moreover, on page 284 Aeron says he will lose his invisibility if he tries to magically open a locked door.  This is not true since only an offensive spell would dispel his invisibility; meaning an actual magical attack against a foe.    In addition, the deaths of both Crow/Samir and Fineghal took place as if both were novices, first level characters (!!!); one arrow (!!!) was enough to dispose of the Master of Invocation, while one thrown dagger (!!!) was enough to render the ancient elf helpless so as to be stabbed to death by commoners???  Hmmm...  After a thousand years, and after serving as the Storm Walker, this was hardly the death this character deserved.  Sacrificing himself against Oriseus or to seal a portal to the demi-plane of Shadow or to destroy to Shadow Stone itself would have been a much more likely and heroic death.    Furthermore, it would havebeen very helpful to know HOW the Sceptenar and Chessenta's champions were defeated by Oriseus as well as WHY other heroes did not intervene with such clear signs of trouble all about e.g. Elminster, the Seven Sisters, Khelben Blackstaff and the other heavyweights.  With the merging of the demi-plane of Shadow onto Chessenta, one would expect help and assistance from the forces of Good from all over Fearun in the shape and form of knowledge/information or the arrival of powerful priests and/or wizards.  Keep in mind that this is a major event concerning the Realms as a whole and not just Chessenta.  In the Third Edition Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting there is mention of the events detailed in the Shadow Stone, and one can find gaming info concerning Aeron (half-elf male N Wiz13/Sha3) and Melisanda (human female LG Wiz 7).    Finally, it takes a while for the story to take off.  The beginning is very slow and not that original.  It is way too predictable and as Aeron makes all the wrong moves and takes all the wrong actions it becomes rather annoying.    Approximately 85 pages into the book, this major transformation occurs and all of a sudden you're captivated, to the point that you can't put the book down.  In short the first third of the book should have been better written.      Richard Baker does a FANTASTIC job of conveying the sheer power and evil of the Immaskari and Shadow Magic, especially after reading: \\"Each chant was a litany of destruction, a hateful incantation of decay and foulness.\\"    I was very excited that the setting for this book was that of the Old Empires.  I wish more novels would be set in that area of Fearun, namely Chessenta, but also Threskel, Unther, and Mulhorand, as opposed to the usual, Waterdeep or Western Heartlands locations.  Hopefully, a sequel will be written shedding light as to what comes next, since the demand for one is definitely there.  If you love Chessenta, Mulhorand, and Unther, try and get your hands on a copy of the Old Empires Accessory (it is Second Edition AD&D, out of print and it will take a bit of searching, but it's well worth it).      In conclusion, despite its flaws, Shadow Stone is a book highly recommended to all Fantasy and especially Forgotten Realms fans.  Those with a soft spot for the Old Empires and Chessenta in particular will have a ball.	2004-09-01
US	52666760	R1BEICEITKVTR1	1560763442	216509641	The Maelstrom's Eye (Spelljammer: Cloakmaster)	Books	5	1	2	N	N	The Cloak of the First Pilot	Maelstrom's Eye is the third book in the Cloakmaster Cycle series, which consists of six (6) books in total.  Picking up from where Into the Void left off, the book continues to shed light on Teldin Moore and his ongoing quest to find out more about the magical cloak he carries a.k.a. \\"The Cloak of the First Pilot\\" and eventually be free of it.  The book does not waste time, instead it rushes to answer some of the questions that have been left lingering/unanswered from the first two books e.g. the changing of the cloak's colors, the ability to comprehend languages, the Reigar race to which the fallen she-captain from Beyond the Moons belonged and more...    This time round, Teldin has changed both physically and mentally; less trusting, longer hair, mustache etc  Ability-wise, he is maturing, becoming more and more experienced and able as a fighter as well as in learning the secrets of the cloak and thus better able at controlling and handling its immense power.  He is able to cast Haste, Magic Missiles, and set up protective magical barriers among others.    The book opens with a bang, immediately catching the reader's interest and attention.  The amazing tour of the exotic Rock of Bral and the graphic way that Vorr dispatches the goodly party leave the reader enthralled!  The book immediately becomes captivating, to the point that it cannot be easily put down.  The graphic slaughter of noble heroes is surely to get one's attention and develop hateful feelings towards the perpetrators.    The plot as a whole is excellent!  The book is so incredibly well written that the reader feels that they have been transported to another plane of existence and are actually present among the characters, seeing what they see, feeling what they feel, sensing what they sense.  Moreover, Roger Moore does a great job of presenting the distinct culture and civilization of the space faring peoples, especially the elves, the gnomes, and the scro.  He has done a great deal of research inorder to provide such an accurate and lucid description of these people.  Neogi, umber hulks, elves, gnomes, space battles, intrigue, betrayal, and swordfights are all about.  In addition, there are some new and interesting races/creatures like the Fal and the scro (space goblinoids) that really do spice up things.  Furthermore, there is a strong sense of Star Wars and Star Trek with the motley collection of aliens that one encounters in Wildspace and on the Rock of Bral in particular, though a map of the Rock would be extremely helpful.  Finally, it is truly wonderful to be provided with so much more information regarding the Spelljamming world.      On the negative side, there is still the question from the first book that is left unanswered as to why Teldin seemed as being a draconian to the draconians while at the SAME TIME as himself to his human companions (there must be some kind of magic from the School of Illusion at work that has not been explained). Hopefully this will be dealt with in one of the other books further down the line.    Secondly, a \\"charmed\\" Teldin could convince Aelfred to mutiny against his captain (Estriss) with little, almost no difficulty after 3 and a half years (!!!) service aboard the Probe, but he could not get him not to hire Gaye, the half-kender girl, whom he'd never met before as a new crew member! Hmm...    Thirdly, the gypsy-like half-kender is really not that great nor that interesting as a character and unless she has some kind of higher mission in the next book (s) there isn't really a good enough reason to have her included in the first place. As for the \\"relationship\\" that seems to be in the making...      Fourthly, the main villain, a scro general, is really too strong/powerful to the point that I don't really know if Teldin and company were up to the task of defeating him.  (Gods DO NOT have 100% Magic resistance!)  He wiped out a party made up of elves, dwarves and humans including priests, fighters, cavaliers and wizards without as much as breaking a sweat!     Finally, as to WHO and HOW succeeds in killing Vorr, the characterization \\"far fetched\\" is an understatement, if I ever saw one!  (Unless again there is more than meets the eye that will be revealed down the line.)    Roger Moore does a FANTASTIC job of conveying the sheer power and evil of the Scro, especially after reading: \\"He buried bones that were burned, bones that were broken, bones that were gnawed upon.\\"    In conclusion, my question is why did Roger Moore not write any more books along the lines of Maelstrom's Eye?	2004-08-28
US	52666760	R20ZP58TI6WDRF	1560761547	320796493	Into the Void (Spelljammer Book, Cloakmaster Cycle, No. 2)	Books	5	4	4	N	N	"When I hunger, I will eat its brain"	Into the Void, is the second book in the Cloakmaster Cycle series, which consists of six (6) books in total.  Picking up from where Beyond the Moons left off, the book sheds light on Teldin Moore and his quest to find out more about the magical cloak he carries and somehow be free of it. <br />This time, the gnomes are much more serious and in control than in the previous book where they were simply pathetic and overly chaotic.  This of course could have been done on purpose in order to support the possibility/notion that space faring gnomes are quite different from \\"dirtkicking\\" ones. <br />Moreover, there is much more information provided regarding the Spelljamming world.  A lot of this material could have and should have been presented in the first book through Gomja, since it is not that complex/difficult/advanced material, even for one as \\"simple\\" as the giff.  Anyway, better late than ever as they say... <br />The plot as a whole is excellent!  The book is so incredibly well written that the reader feels that they have been transported to another plane of existence and are actually present among the characters, seeing what they see, feeling what they feel, sensing what they sense.  Moreover, Nigel Findley does a great job of presenting the distinct culture and civilization of the space faring peoples.  He has done a great deal of research in order to provide such an accurate and lucid description of these people. <br />Illithids, neogi, space battles, intrigue, betrayal, and swordfights are all about. <br />In addition, there are some new and interesting races/creatures like the Arcane (very Star Trekish) and the space sharks that spice up things. <br />Furthermore, there are strong elements throughout the book of both Star Trek and Babylon 5, therefore Sci Fi fans should really get a kick out of this one. <br />On the negative side, there are some questions from the first book that are left unanswered:  a) Why/how Teldin can understand foreign languages (it is obviously the cloak, but has Teldin picked up on it)?  b) Why did he seem as being a draconian to the draconians while at the SAME TIME as himself to humans (there must be some kind of magic from the School of Illusion at work that has not been explained).  <br />No answers there; hopefully that will be dealt with in one of the other books further down the line. <br />Furthermore, Estriss is presented much more like Zoidberg from Futurama as opposed to the dreaded mind flayers that we're all used to.  He's just too \\"nice.\\"  As a result, further explanation should be given as to WHY Estriss is not like the other mind flayers!  <br />Finally, towards the end of the book, a \\"charmed\\" Teldin has little trouble convincing Aelfred with no evidence whatsoever, and who up until then had been a model for loyalty, and who has known Teldin for only a couple of months, to mutiny against Estriss, whom he's known and worked for, for years.  This one is a bit far fetched... <br />I recommend the Spelljammer Campaign Setting or any other Spelljammer accessory to supplement the material, and/or provide visual aids to the reader in relation to helms, ships, creatures/races etc.   <br />In conclusion, Nigel Findley does a FANTASTIC job of establishing a cliffhanger for the next, third book in the series.  Into the Void is strongly recommended to all Spelljammer and Forgotten Realms fans, as well as all Fantasy enthusiasts.	2004-08-17
US	52666760	R13SAUVQUL3GW9	1560761539	905141048	Beyond the Moons (Spelljammer / The Cloakmaster Cycle, No. 1)	Books	4	2	4	N	N	A Good Introduction to Spelljamming!	Beyond Moons, is the first book in the Cloakmaster Cycle series, which consists of six (6) books in total, and deals primarily with introducing the readers to the World of Spelljammer.  <br />Specifically the book sheds light on Teldin, a simple farmer and war veteran, though a non-combatant (he was a mule skinner), as he makes the leap from \\"groundling\\" to spacefarer.  By his side, is Gomja, a giff warrior that finds himself stranded on Krynn as a result of his ship's crash landing. <br />The plot as a whole is very good!  The book is well written and the reader feels that they have been transported to another plane of existence and are actually present among the characters, seeing what they see, feeling what they feel, sensing what they sense.  Moreover, David Cook does a good job of presenting several different cultures and civilizations of Krynn's peoples/inhabitants.  Furthermore, he has done a great deal of research in order to provide such an accurate and lucid description of the difficulties and hardships that people face in war. <br />The book itself is written very much along the lines of an adventure/module the author ran with his friends during a series o gaming sessions.  This is actually like a double-edged knife; on the one hand it gets the reader in the right mood for what is to come, and that is positive, since most people reading the book either play or have played in the past, or would like to play and want to get a feel for the World, though on the other hand it can be slow, very slow, at times.  <br />On the negative side, the book does have a few flaws e.g. In the city of Palanthas, when Tilden follows the mercenaries to their hiding place and witnesses their slaughter at the hands of the neogi and the umber hulks, why does he not lead the city guard to their location?  <br />Moreover, how is it possible that the elven ship, \\"the Silver Spray,\\" was NOT guarded, at NIGHT, AND while docked in port, specifically a HUMAN port (???), especially withthe elves portrayed so paranoid, wary and hostile towards non-elves, to the point that the duo could sneak on board and hide till morning?  And after taking a look at the giff they still took them on???   <br />It would have been easier/simpler to just get passage on any other, human, gnome, or kender ship, even if it meant spending a few more days in the city.  Not that big of a problem, especially, if the city guard had been called in the first place, and with the help of wizards from the nearby tower, had dealt with the neogi.   <br />Or have the duo save Cwelanas from danger, at a time when she is cornered and outnumbered by drunken human sailors or something along those lines, and thus EARN passage on the ship, thus avoiding the \\"miraculously\\" unguarded entrance altogether. Another question is, why doesn't Cwelanas join Teldin and Gomja? <br />In addition, the book takes Teldin from 0-level farmer to 1-level fighter. <br />How he was able to take on minotaurs (!!!) and not only survive, but \\"win\\" beats me (he only had a few days practice, with a spear, prior to the battle...). Moreover, how he managed to escape the big neogi in the pit is also a bit far fetched, not to mention both how he got captured and how he escaped from the neogi ship! <br />David Cook is also a bit stingy with relevant information/knowledge/background of giffs, spelljammers and the void (space), instead insinuating that Gomja is rather \\"slow.\\"  Now there is slow and there is retarded, and Gomja, though simple (he's no ace), does not seem to be the latter. <br />Finally, the map at the beginning of the book (which is GREAT for some much needed direction sense) should NOT have been marked with \\"draconian, neogi, and minotaur pirate attack\\" sites for obvious reasons; it practically gives away the story!  NO surprises when you already know what to expect!!! <br />Nevertheless, there are some wonderful scenes, especially in the beginning, but also at sea involving naval battle.  The torture scenes are very graphic (well done!), as you really get to despise the neogi.  Most importantly the steady development of Teldin's and Gomja's friendship is very well presented. <br />The author does follow the right pattern of how a 0-level character leaves home and picks up experience as he goes on etc. <br />Beyond Moons starts off incredibly well and continues so, up until half way through; enter the party's arrival at Palanthas and the passage to Sancrist, before it picks up again, for what ends up being a good fantasy book. <br />In gaming terms Teldin is LG, Gomja LN, Cwelanas CN, and Luciar LN.     <br />In conclusion, Beyond Moons is strongly recommended to all Spelljammer and Dragonlance fans, but also Fantasy enthusiasts in general.  The Cloakmaster Series should definitely be re-released, not to mention what a really great movie (or set of movies) it would make!	2004-08-13
US	52666760	R1S3XDYWP104RM	1585674028	787049495	The Spartans	Books	2	13	28	N	Y	A Major Disappointment Indeed!!!	After reading about Paul Cartledge's credentials (\\"Professor at Oxford University\\", \\"expert\\" and \\"authority\\" in the world of classics and ancient history, especially in regards to Sparta etc) one naturally expects excellence in relation to the quality of the study, and yet, what one gets is mediocrity instead.   <br />To start with, the writer does not follow the basic guidelines in writing history, i.e. he uses the first (\\"in my opinion\\") and second (\\"we\\") person when writing which is highly unprofessional to say the least.  One should NEVER get personal or emotional when writing history!  Historians need to be objective and look at different perspectives when writing.  It is common knowledge that when dealing with History essays/papers only the third person is accepted, anything else is a sign of amateur work. We are not in grade school, nor are we sitting in front of the fireplace listening to our grandfather telling stories; It is serious academic work!   <br />On page 25, Cartledge states: \\"`Go tell the Spartans!' which has also been used as the title of a movie based on the Vietnam War\\" What is the point of this comment???  What could possibly compel the writer to bring Vietnam into this? <br />On page 119, Cartledge states: \\"It was the so-called Middle Gate that the loyalist Greek defense force took up its position; this is where the modern memorial has been erected, to the right of the National Highway as you drive north.  On the other side of the highway there may be visited what has been designated, probably correctly, as the hillock where the Greeks made their stand.\\"  This is not a tourist guide, nor is it a \\"visit the sights\\" brochure.  No one really cares if Cartledge has been to the sight so he really does not need to prove that he has. <br />Moreover, on page 244 \\"the Greek word for civil strife, faction-fighting or civil war was stasis (it's now the Modern Greek word for `bus stop'...) Hello, Mr Cartlidge??? Is this an attempt at a joke that has noplace in such a study or is it just completely useless information that has nothing to do with the topic?  Either way, poor choice of words!  In addition, \\"stasis\\", today is not only used to describe a \\"stop\\" (bus, train etc), but also a revolt or rebellion.  Remember that unless one is 100% certain about something, they should refrain from using words that indicate absolute certainty. <br />Furthermore, throughout the book, the author refers to homosexual relationships between Spartans (Lysander and Agesilaus pp200) and Thebans (The Sacred Band) as proven fact (\\"among the innovations they presided over was the creation of an elite hoplite force of 300, consisting of 150 homosexual couples\\"pp225), when the existing evidence surrounding the issue of whether homosexuality in ancient Greece was more or less accepted than today is inconclusive and the issue itself is highly controversial;  therefore, calling for the use of \\"alleged homosexuality\\" instead.  The heroes themselves would be turning in their graves if they knew what is being written and said about them by people who are either misinformed or are purposely out to distort the truth in following their own personal agendas.  <br />In conclusion, one could spend hours on end dissecting Cartledge's book, however, what is important to note is that the book fails to capture the readers' attention and imagination.  It fails to transport the reader to Ancient Greece and to provide a feeling of familiriaty with the Spartans.  Instead, the style used is dry, with the book being at times overly simplified while elsewhere overly packed with factual detail for the sake of including factual material as opposed to making a point efficiently or successfully.	2004-08-12

Definitely a great fantasy epic and one of my personal favorites, The Blood Wars Trilogy-Blood Hostages, Abyssal Warriors, and Planar Powers, brings to life the story of Aereas and Nina, two cousins, and their adventures in the \\"multiverse\\" that is the World of Planescape.  The books are so incredibly well written that the reader feels that they have been transported to another universe and are actually present among the characters, seeing what they see, feeling what they feel, sensing what they sense.   <br />The author has done a FANTASTIC job of both acquiring vast knowledge relevant to the Planes as well as presenting this material efficiently and successfully! His solid grasp of factual detail makes him very capable of providing the necessary background needed to carry out the very difficult task of writing Planescape novels, which is something often missing from the work of many Fantasy authors.   <br />JR King has truly outdone himself and has presented us with a masterpiece of literature the likes of which we have seen only in JRR Tolkien's work and in authors Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman's Dragonlance Chronicles and Legends trilogies as well as RA Salvatore's Icewind Dale and Dark Elf Trilogies.  Love, fiends, bravery, magic, swordfights and battles of epic proportion are all about.

This is the story of Artus Cimber, explorer, adventurer, historian, and former Harper, as he searches high and low for the Ring of Winter.  The book traces Artus Cimber's journey from the kingdom of Cormyr, to Baldur's Gate, and down the Sea of Swords to the Jungles of Chult in search of the mythical/legendary artifact \\"The Ring of Winter,\\" which is rumored to provide immortality... at a cost; the coming of a second Ice Age.  Needless to say this artifact is something that more than a few people would like to call their own, and so the adventure begins.    The book is a great tie-in with James Lowder's previous book Crusade, so if you can, read them in that order.    The Ring of Winter starts off incredibly well and continues so, up until half way through; enter the talking wombats (!!!), in British accents (!!!), before it picks up again a few pages later, for what ends up being a very good fantasy book.  Jim, what were you thinking with the wombats???  And keep those Artus Cimber stories coming!  In short, the book is very well written and the characters really do come alive, so if you like tropical jungles, dinosaurs, exotic goblins, and would like a change of scenery to break the routine without leaving the Forgotten Realms world, try and get your hands on a copy of The Jungles of Chult.	2004-08-07

The Jungles of Chult is an excellent Forgotten Realms accessory/adventure, as good as Old Empires, Dreams of Red Wizards, Dwarves Deep and Moonsea!  It sheds light on the exotic southern land of Chult and its inhabitants.  Their distinct culture, history, and civilization will win you over for sure!  Ranging from background history, to city and social descriptions, to important people and characters, to the respective gods and pantheons, to adventure hooks and encounter tables, to magical items and artifacts, to new spells and monsters, this accessory has it all and more.  For other FR references/adventures, I STRONGLY recommend: the Old Empires accessory on Chessenta, Mulhorand, and Unther, Dreams of Red Wizards on Thay, Dwarves Deep, Draconomicon, the Moonsea accessory, the Ruins of Myth Drannor Box Set, and the Ruins of Zhentil Keep Box Set (they are Second Edition AD&D, out of print and it will take a bit of searching, but it's well worth it).  For updated editions of events in Chult, see the Third Edition Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting, which even though is quite expensive, is still very useful to all FR fans.  Moreover, The Ring of Winter, being the only novel set in the Jungles of Chult is a \\"must.\\"  In short, if you like tropical jungles, dinosaurs, exotic goblins, and would like a change of scenery to break the routine, try and get your hands on a copy of The Jungles of Chult.

The book is so incredibly well written that the reader feels that they have been transported to another plane of existence and are actually present among the characters, seeing what they see, feeling what they feel, sensing what they sense.  Moreover, James Lowder does a great job of presenting the distinct culture and civilization of the peoples of the Heartlands; Cormyr, Sembia, the Dales etc.  Furthermore, he has done a great deal of research in order to provide such an accurate and lucid description of the difficulties and hardships facing people that have lost their homes and have become refugees as a result of war. <br />His solid grasp of factual detail makes him very capable of providing the necessary background needed to carry out the difficult task of writing Forgotten Realms novels, which is something often missing from the work of many Fantasy authors.   <br /> <br />On the negative side, the book does have a few silly mistakes e.g. onpage 29 \\"villainous neighbors to the north\\" should be \\"to the south,\\" on page 37 \\"ancestors\\" should be \\"descendants,\\" on page 71 \\"She close/chose to ignore\\" etc <br />Moreover, a better Cormyrean insurgency and opposition to the Crusade could be used, in the shape of the \\"Rebel Prince's\\" Selamber's supporters, or those wanting to end the monarchy, but the \\"green-clad\\" Trappers Guild???  And why?  Because of taxes?  This is still the \\"goodly\\" Kingdom of Cormyr and King Azoun would never raise taxes to the point of destroying peoples' lives or businesses. Along with the Trappers, the Tanners and Butchers are also opposed to the war, and again it is difficult to comprehend why.  Indifferent yes, militantly opposed, probably not. <br />In addition, I am going to have to agree with the previous reviewer when he says that the gathering of the crusading army took too long in comparison to the actual showdown between the two armies.  Furthermore, the final duel between Yamun and Azoun was indeed over without the magnificent climax that one would expect from \\"a clash of titans.\\" <br />The book could have/should have been longer by 50 to 100 pages to include more detail relevant to the story. <br />Nevertheless, Crusade presents excellent insight on Cormyrean life, culture, politics, history, civilization, King Azoun and the royal family. <br />There are some wonderful scenes set at sea as well as some impressive battle scenes involving thousands of troops and the use of War Wizards' magic. <br />Together with Cormyr, The High Road and Death of Dragon (in that order), they make for a wonderful set dealing with the kingdom of Cormyr and the ruling Obarskyr royal family. <br />In conclusion, Crusade is strongly recommended to all Forgotten Realms fans.  The Empires Trilogy should definitely be re-released, not to mention what a really great movie (or set of movies) it would make!	2004-08-03

Dragonwall, is the second book in the Empires Trilogy, and deals primarily with Shou Lung (located to the far east of Faerun), and its inhabitants. <br />Picking up from where Horselords left off, the book sheds light on General Batu, leading the imperial forces in the defense of his homeland against Khahan Yamun and the Tuigan army. <br />Whereas Horselords looks at the story from the point of view of Koja and the Tuigan, Dragonwall looks at the continuation of the same story from the point of view of General Batu and the Shou Lung.  It's not bad, just a bit unusual, and it does take some getting used to. <br />The plot as a whole is excellent!  The book is so incredibly well written that the reader feels that they have been transported to another plane of existence and are actually present among the characters, seeing what they see, feeling what they feel, sensing what they sense.  Moreover, Troy Denning does a great job of presenting the distinct culture and civilization of the peoples of the Orient.  He has done a great deal of research in order to provide such an accurate and lucid description of the Chinese-like people. <br />Red Wizards, Gnolls, epic battles, sieges, political intrigue, blackmail, assassinations, and betrayal are all about. <br />In conclusion, Dragonwall has something for everyone, and is strongly recommended to all Forgotten Realms fans, especially Eastern/Oriental enthusiasts. <br />	2004-07-29

The title is a bit misleading if you are expecting epic battles/wars. There are encounters with ice mephits and elementals (one of each...) and gnolls, but the book lacks that extra something needed to push it over the top. Both the plot and the writing are average. Instead, I recommend other books from the Series such as Red Magic or Parched Sea to mention a few, all the while keeping in mind the \\"heavy artillery\\" Forgotten Realms novels that have been written by RA Salvatore, Elaine Cunningham, Ed Greenwood etc My advice, read the Soldiers of Ice only after you're done reading most of the other Forgotten Realms books and you are still in need of more Toril related material.	2004-07-26
US	52666760	R1W4UFN0YY9IV9	0786911778	456547956	THORNHOLD (Forgotten Realms: The Harpers, #16)	Books	4	0	3	N	N	When three (rings) unite in power and purpose, evil trembles	Thornhold starts off incredibly well and continues so, up until chapter 16, about 40 pages before the end. I am not going to go to town on Elaine Cunningham or her book, since I am a big fan of hers and this is the only book that I, and from what I can tell many others, seem to a have a problem with. The plot as a whole is not bad at all; to the contrary it's a great story! It's just that the more one reads, the more &quot;vicious&quot; the attacks on the paladins get!  <br /> At first I thought it wasn't a case of Harpers vs Paladins, but a matter of Law vs Chaos, thus giving the author, without second thought, the benefit of the doubt. <br /> As the book progresses, the feelings change: Law and Good (LG) vs Balance and Good (NG); understood. Similarly, the book portrays the rift between Cyric's and Bane's followers which has erupted into full scale war; also understood.  <br /> Nevertheless, there are clearly &quot;favorites&quot; in this book, and paladins are not included among them. I am not one to come streaming to their defense, but it is evident that paladins are made to look like complete fools, morons, verging dangerously close on idiocy. <br /> Plain and simple: Paladins and Zhentarim are presented as the &quot;bad guys&quot;, which is very difficult indeed for the average D&D enthusiast to swallow. <br /> There are, however, many truths included as well; the difficulty or impossibility of having a paladin in a party that does not exclusively consist of paladins (that's why they are rare, loners and tend to have a very short lifespan). That does not take away from their &quot;goodness&quot;. As the previous reviewer (from Ohio) very correctly pointed out, the paladins are portrayed much more as Lawful Neutral than Lawful Good. <br /> The example of paladins giving chase to a band of orcs who run into the forest and are met by the forest's elves only to be slaughtered once the paladins hear that they will not be allowed to further pursue their enemies could be a possibility. However, it is much more likely that elves and paladins would join forces to smite evil together. <br /> My main question is how was Sir Gareth, a &quot;fallen paladin&quot;, NOT discovered in 30 years (!!!), by his fellow paladins? All the magical protections/amulets could not keep his secret hidden. Moreover, Sir Gareth is not supposed to be evil, yet why does he accept service in the ranks of the Zhentarim and Cyric, who are blatantly evil? Is &quot;I am pledged to honor the children of Samular's bloodline&quot;, enough for a fallen paladin to become a Zhentarim operative? Or is helping his brother and owner of Zhentarim houses of ill repute worth becoming a fallen paladin in the first place, especially when they are portrayed as being so loyal to their cause, that they end up being more Lawful than Good. <br /> In addition, towards the end, when the Gladestone elven/half-elven settlement is attacked by orcs, one of the inhabitants, a half-elf woman, accuses the paladins for indirectly inciting the attack (!!!), and what's more the dwarf feels guilty for wanting to kill orcs!!! Previously, the paladin Carwin had told Algorid that it was their own fault that the orcs attacked the town. Is it me or is there something wrong here? Orcs ARE enemies! Orcs were never good, unlike dark elves. There is no orcish Drizzt Do'Urden. Orcs, and the specific orcs in the book, are EVIL. There is no neutral or good god for orcs, like Eilistraee is for the drow; there is Gruumsh One-Eyed and Company. What should one expect next, a LG red dragon or an orc paladin? What we do get though is Ebenezer the Dwarf, having pity and mercy for Orcish females and children, giving them advice and toys and sending them on their way???  <br /> After all that's said and done, the question that automatically comes to mind is what alignment is Bronwyn, when she doesn't return Thornhold to the Order of Samular, which is not only an order set up to fight Evil, but the order that HER OWN ancestor set up, and decides instead to hold on to it for herself and her niece Cara. Yes, it is her right to do so, the deed is in her name after all, but that is something a neutral character would do, not a Harper. Who in their right mind would deny paladins their base of operations? And who would put a knife (!!!) to a paladin's throat to save their father's murderer who also happens to be a high ranking priest of Cyric, a high level member of the Zhentarim, and a top commander of the Zhentilar fortress of Darkhold, even when that is her brother who is clearly using his own daughter to further his own selfish needs in pursuit of wealth and power? She could compromise with the paladin and have her brother face trial in Waterdeep in a secular court and have him locked away. <br /> One final question: if Bronwyn feels so restricted and oppressed by Those Who Harp why doesn't she just quit and leave the organization altogether! <br /> On the positive side, the book is action packed, the characters for the most part are great, the overall plot is very good, and there is plenty of conflict to go around. Hopefully, a sequel will be written setting things straight by shedding light as to what comes next. <br /> In conclusion, it is my belief that the book for the most part deserves 5 stars for being so well written and presented (the usual Elaine Cunningham top quality). After chapter 16, though, the book falls to 3 stars, for the reasons mentioned above, for a total of 4 stars. It falls short of 5 stars for creating a sense of confusion among readers to the point that paladins might end up being the main course for many goodly parties, and that is plainly not right!	2004-07-26

Scott Ciencin is a GREAT author (Shadowdale was AMAZING), but unfortunately The Night Parade was a bit of a disappointment! It is much closer to HORROR than it is to FANTASY. Therefore, it is not your conventional Forgotten Realms fantasy novel. For those fans who enjoy Horror this is a book that combines the two, but for the rest of us, I recommend other books from the Series such as Red Magic or Parched Sea to mention a few, all the while keeping in mind the &quot;heavy artillery&quot; Forgotten Realms novels that have been written by RA Salvatore, Elaine Cunningham, Ed Greenwood etc My advice, read The Night Parade only after you're done reading all the other Forgotten Realms books and you are still in need of more Toril related material.	2004-07-26

Horselords is the first book in the Empires Trilogy, which deals with a neglected part of the Realms, the Hordelands (located east of Faerun), and its inhabitants. <br />Specifically the book sheds light on Khahan Yamun, leader of the Tuigan tribe and his campaign of conquest in the lands of Kara-Tur.  By his side, is Koja, a priest of Furo and advisor to Yamun. <br />The plot as a whole is very good.  The book is a little slow in the beginning, but very well written, and as it goes on the characters come alive.  David Cook does a great job of presenting the distinct culture and civilization of the peoples of the steppe.  He has done a great deal of research in order to provide such an accurate and lucid description of the Mongol-like people. <br />There are strong elements that are characteristic of the TV miniseries Shogun, starring Richard Chamberlain, that aired in the early Eighties. <br />In conclusion, Horselords is strongly recommended for Eastern/Oriental enthusiasts who have a soft spot for Genghis Khan and everything Mongol.	2004-07-26

Dream Spheres is the fifth book in Elaine Cunningham's series after Elfshadow, Elfsong, Silver Shadows, and Thornhold.  Keep in mind that there are several short stories that take place before, during, and after events presented in these five books and can be found in the Dragon magazines 246 and 259, and the novels Realms of Mystery, Realms of Infamy, and Realms of Valor.  This is why there are some reviewers that feel \\"lost\\". <br />In relation to Dream Spheres, it takes a while for the story to take off, i.e. it is rather slow.  The first scene, the party at the Thann residence, takes up almost 50 pages (!!!) and it's not that great.   <br />This comes in contrast with the previous in line book, Thornhold, which starts off by capturing the reader's attention/interest from the very first page, though the ending is very disappointing. <br />The plot as a whole is not bad, but it is not great either.  It is just that the more one reads, the more one realizes how much like a soap opera the series, and this book in particular has become; enough with the Danilo-Arilyn relationship difficulties already! Get married or break up! And enough with Arilyn's attitude problem. <br />Moreover, the tren are not that great or interesting of a nemesis, especially not one to be used so much throughout the whole book. <br />Khelben Blackstaff who we see a lot of in Thornhold has only a few lines in Dream Spheres for no apparent reason (he might as well have been considered to have been absent from the City of Splendors). <br />Furthermore, the SERIES seems to be going back and forth between Waterdeep and Tethyr, Waterdeep and Tethyr...  There are other places in Faerun to visit. <br />The mother-in-law thing was just too much... <br />My main question is why did Danilo not raise his sister?  If she had been devoured by tren yes, but she was found in one piece.   <br />Most of the favorite characters are there, some without good reason though. <br />(I agree with many of the points the reviewer \\"kalan\\" has made further down)  <br />It is unfortunate, that there is no mention of the issues/matters that do matter to us fans, and had been left lingering at the end of Thornhold; Arilyn's brother Dag Zoreth, Arilyn's niece Cara Doon, the Thornhold fortress, the Samular Paladin order, the paladin Algorind, the Zhentarim that had a change of heart, the three rings and the artifact etc. <br />What we do get though, is the arrival of Foxfire and a wild elf band in the City of Splendors???  How did they ever make the journey north in one piece? And how were they allowed in the City without city guard supervision yet alone participate in the fighting that took place?  Especially when the City is supposed to be so vigilant in relation to elves. <br />There seem to be too many things going on at the same time just for the sake of it, and not for any apparent reason. <br />At first I thought it was just a matter of getting to the good part, but the book seems to lack that something to put it over the top, along with Elaine Cunnigham's other work. <br />On the positive side, the book is not terrible, the characters for the most part are familiar if not good, the overall plot is alright, and hopefully a sequel will be written setting things straight by shedding light as to what comes next. <br />In conclusion, it is my belief that the book for the most part deserves about 3.5 stars, and since I am an Elaine Cunningham fan, that translates into a 4.	2004-07-25

Along the lines of JRR Tolkien's classic, the Silmarillion, and with a slight touch of Spelljammer and Planescape, comes Elaine Cunningham's Forgotten Realms novel, Evermeet: Island of Elves.<BR>It deals with the Elves and their long journey through the eons up until the present (as far as the Forgotten Realms world is concerned). <BR>It does bring to mind Ed Greenwood's and Jeff Grubb's Cormyr, and one could easily claim that Evermeet deals with the Elves in a similar way that Cormyr presents the history of the Cormyreans, or Cormytes as is more common within the Kingdom.<BR>The book is so incredibly well written that the reader feels that they have been transported to another universe and are actually present among the characters, seeing what they see, feeling what they feel, sensing what they sense.  Elaine Cunnigham has truly outdone herself once again and has presented us with a masterpiece of literature the likes of which we have seen only in JRR Tolkien's work, RA Salvatore's The Dark Elf and Icewind Dale trilogies and in authors Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman's Dragonlance Chronicles and Legends trilogies.  <BR>She has done a FANTASTIC job of both acquiring vast knowledge relevant to the People as well as presenting this material relating to the customs, the religion and the history of the Elves, efficiently and successfully! Her solid grasp of factual detail makes her very capable of providing the necessary background needed to carry out the difficult task of writing Forgotten Realms novels, especially one as complex as this, which is something often missing from the work of many Fantasy authors.  Do keep in mind though, that Evermeet is not a book for the light-hearted, instead it is more tuned to the needs/taste of the Forgotten Realms die-hards (like myself...)<BR>Gods, Elves, Dragons, Magic, Honor, Love and swordfights are all about.  Elaine Cunningham's Elfshadow, Elfsong, and Silver Shadows make up for a great trilogy and are a \\"must read\\" together with Evermeet, especially for all those who have a soft spot for everything Elven!	2004-06-23

There are no words to describe this work of art coming from the Master himself: JRR Tolkien.  Since the coming of the Hobbit and the LOR, a whole industry has risen with millions of fantasy fans becoming enthralled to majesty that is &quot;Tolkien&quot;.  Through the pages of the Silmarillion, JRR Tolkien sheds light on the history, the culture, and the myths of Middle Earth, the magical world that he created and which became an inspiration to so many worldwide.  Considering when it was written, and the impact that it has had worldwide, 5 Stars are just too few for a masterpiece of such magnitude.  This book is not easy reading by any means, therefore, it is not recommended for the light-hearted, instead it is much more tuned to the needs/taste of the Middle Earth die-hards (like myself...)<BR>In conclusion, it is strongly recommended that in order to receive full enjoyment of the book while avoiding confusion due to the sheer volume of factual material, one should keep in close proximity one of the many Middle Earth guides/encyclopedias that are available for quick reference if the need arises.

Slightly better than both Murder in Cormyr and Murder in Halruaa, but still a bit of a disappointment!  Well written, but not the kind of book that you'll have trouble putting down.  The plot and setting are ok, but that's it, mediocre; nothing more, nothing less.  It is very unfortunate that the Murder Series came to an end before the writing of Murder in Ravens Bluff and WotC should reconsider their decision now that years have gone by and maybe resurrect the project, but considering the poor work included in these books I can at least understand why they did so back then. In conclusion, the heroes are average, the villains are very weak, the plot is ok and the writing is good.  My advice, read it only after you're done reading most of the other Dragonlance books such as in authors Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman's Dragonlance Chronicles and Legends trilogies, and you are still in need of more Krynn related material; at least you'll get a slight hint/taste of Ansalon.<BR>PS What was the point of including Badar in the book?  The character's contribution to the plot is nil.	2004-06-15

Definitely a great fantasy epic and one of my personal favorites, THE PARCHED SEA sheds light on the ever-expanding magical desert of Anauroch set in the amazing world of the Forgotten Realms!   The book is the first in a series of 16 novels focusing on the legendary Harpers, the primary secret organization fighting the spread of evil in Faerun.  A Bedine witch outcast joins a Harper agent out of Sembia sent into the Desert to thwart the Zhentarim plans of enslaving the indigenous peoples, setting up a direct trade route between East and West, and eventually expanding Zhentish influence all across the continent.  In the process, the couple will have to overcome its worse fears if they are to stand a chance at success...  The Parched Sea deals with a neglected part of the Realms, The Desert of Anauroch, with its rich history, its proud and exotic people, and that feeling of excitement and adventure.  The book is so incredibly well written that the reader feels that they have been transported to another plane of existence and are actually present among the characters, seeing what they see, feeling what they feel, sensing what they sense.   Troy Denning has done a FANTASTIC job of acquiring and presenting, efficiently and successfully, essential knowledge relevant to Faerun, including customs, religion and the history of the peoples of Toril.  His solid grasp of factual detail makes him capable of providing the necessary background needed to carry out the difficult task of writing Forgotten Realms novels, which is something often missing from the work of many Fantasy authors. Consequently, from the moment you pick up the book you have trouble putting it down and if that is not a clear sign of a fantastic writer/author, I don't know what is!  Troy Denning is an experienced author, who has truly outdone himself and has presented us with a wonderful piece of literature the likes of which can be compared to JRR Tolkien's work, RA Salvatore's The Dark Elf and Icewind Dale trilogies, and in authors Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman's Dragonlance Chronicles and Legends trilogies.  Magic, Monsters, Harpers and Zhents are all about. In conclusion, it's what Fantasy reading SHOULD be. A GREAT book indeed and a \\"must read\\" if you love Fantasy and especially if you love the Forgotten Realms! DON'T MISS IT!!!  The Veiled Dragon, Harpers novel #12, also happens to be Troy Denning's sequel to The Parched Sea.  I can't wait...	2004-06-05

Unfortunately, both Murder in Cormyr as well as Murder in Halruaa are a major disappointment indeed! Badly written, by what seems to be inexperienced people who not only to have had no previous work or any serious contact with Fantasy (not even to mention the specifics of the Forgotten Realms Campaign World), but writing books-ANY books- in general! Myself, a mystery enthusiast of Arthur Conan Doyle?s and Agatha Christie's work and a Fantasy/Dungeons and Dragons &quot;Fanatic&quot; have no alternative, but to write this negative review in an effort to warn the potential reader of what they are in for. Both these authors should at least have read a Forgotten Realms novel before attempting to write one, and what's more if they did not want to or did not have the ability to write this type of book, they should not even have attempt it. However, since they did, how and why were these books allowed to hit the printing press and then the stores? They discredit themselves (the authors), they discredit TSR, but most importantly they discredit the readers/fans of the Forgotten Realms, especially those who thought that combining Fantasy and Mystery would be a great idea, like myself. From the weak plot, to the bad writing, to the ridiculous choice of names for the characters, to the jokes that fall flat, to the great lack of knowledge regarding Toril, the books fail miserably! <br>It is very unfortunate that the Murder Series came to an end before the writing of Murder in Ravens Bluff and WotC should reconsider their decision now that years have gone by and maybe resurrect the project, but considering the poor work included in these books I can at least understand why they did so back then. In conclusion, it is with great sadness that I only give two stars to these books since almost all the Forgotten Realms novels that have been written have been more than wonderful-what with RA Salvatore, Elaine Cunningham, Ed Greenwood etc. The books could have been fantastic if the rightpeople or the necessary care had been given during the writing of the stories. A shame really! My advice, read them only after you're done reading all the other Forgotten Realms books and you are still in need of more Toril related material; at least you'll get a slight hint/taste of Faerun.	2004-06-03

In conclusion, it is with great sadness that I only give two stars to these books since almost all the Forgotten Realms novels that have been written have been more than wonderful-what with RA Salvatore, Elaine Cunningham, Ed Greenwood etc. The books could have been fantastic if the rightpeople or the necessary care had been given during the writing of the stories. A shame really! My advice, read them only after you're done reading all the other Forgotten Realms books and you are still in need of more Toril related material; at least you'll get a slight hint/taste of Faerun.	2004-06-03

Definitely a great fantasy epic and one of my personal favorites, The Icewind Dale Trilogy- The Crystal Shard, Streams of Silver, and The Halfling's Gem, brings to life the story of a good hearted dark elf ranger named Drizzt Do'Urden and his adventures in the northwestern reaches of the World of Faerun.  The books are so incredibly well written that the reader feels that they have been transported to another universe and are actually present among the characters, seeing what they see, feeling what they feel, sensing what they sense.  RA Salvatore has truly outdone himself and has presented us with a masterpiece of literature the likes of which we have seen only in JRR Tolkien's work and in authors Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman's Dragonlance Chronicles and Legends trilogies.  Duty, honor, bravery, magic, dragons and heroes are all about.  A great trilogy indeed and a \\"must read\\" along with RA Salvatore's Dark Elf Trilogy!!!	2004-02-22

They Dare to Speak Out is a valuable guide in understanding how and why the USA is being held hostage by lobbies whose allegiance lies elsewhere and not with America.  The book is an eye opener for the majority of Americans and non-Americans alike.  Through They Dare to Speak Out, the reader is able to understand why the USA has double standards when dealing with the Middle East and subsequently why the world is so upset with American foreign policy accusing it of overflowing with hypocrisy.  Most importantly, one finds answers to the most pressing issue/question of our times, which is none other than the 9/11 attack and the reasons behind it.  Is the policy of mindlessly defending, even when in the wrong, one small insignificant and yet aggressive country/\\"ally\\" worth the risk of global alienation, worldwide condemnation and even a possible repeat of terrorist acts?	2004-02-08

The Gates of Fire brings to life THE most heroic battle in world history, the Battle at Thermopylae; a three day battle (August 18th, 480 BC through August 20th, 480 BC) for the pass at Thermopylae (the Hot Gates) between an immense Persian host under King Xerxes and a small Greek force dominated by King Leonidas and his 300 Spartans.  Unlike the Alamo, Custer's Last Stand and many other glorious battles where the parties involved did not expect to be wiped out, the Spartans and Thespians willingly held their positions knowing that they could not possibly win against such overwhelming numbers.  Together with The Gates of Fire, The 300 Spartans (a 1962 classic) is a \\"must see\\" movie about honor, real men, and real heroes who fought and died in the name of Greece and Freedom at Thermopylae.  \\"Stranger, go tell the Spartans that we lie here in obedience to their laws.\\"	2004-02-08

The unification of Greece took place under the hegemony of Macedonia and lead to the downfall of the Persian Empire and the establishment of the mighty Empire of Alexander the Great, through which the Greeks avenged themselves for the Persian Wars and spread Hellenism across the \\"Known World\\" and into the far reaches of uncharted lands in Asia. <BR>With this ongoing communist-style propaganda one cannot help, but wonder what's next?
