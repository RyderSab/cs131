The plot is full of twists and turns, and one could see the story thickening as you read.  As well as an excellent plot, S.D. Tower penned wonderful descriptions vivedly of the world in which this story takes place, so much that one seems to have fallen into its exotic landscapes and histoies while reading. This novel is full of exceptional characters and heroines as well, from the Despot driven mad by the murder of her son, to the orphan daughters whose trust and love in their mother eliminated all questioning to the actions they were ordered to do.  I found this novel deeply engrossing, as you will find too, for once you start reading this tale, you will be inevitably drawn in, and you won't be able to leave until Lale's story is told and finished.	2005-09-02

Its a charming, sweet love story about a Princess who is cursed, a Prince who doesn't know he is a prince.  It is about an evil Queen, a troll father, a weak King and p-mailing.

Her idea of fun is to break into old haunted mansions and her idea of romance is a picnic at midnight in a graveyard. Raven's got guts, and she sticks up for her friend Beckie, when 'Dullsvinians' bully her.  I especially liked how she got her revenge on Trevor, and her funny nicknames for the people in her town.  For a quick, funny read, I definitely suggest this novel	2005-03-22

Unfortunately, as I kept reading, this book became more and more confusing.  As many other people already mentioned, there are quite a few moments when I had to re-read the scene because I had no idea what was going on.      I also liked the character Guinevere, but in a way she was too perfect!! And I'm also still wondering why Alice Borchardt decided to make Merlin evil.    I kept reading this book hoping that my questions would be answered, but sooner than I thought, the ending was already there and I was more confused than ever.    However, the great thing about this book is that I actually kept reading it.  Alice Borchardt writes magnificently, and I was really swept away into her world.	2005-02-14

Sophie Hatter is the eldest of her sisters and in the land of Ingary, if you were born first, you would be destined to fail first. One day, Sophie's mother decides that she would have to settle all of her three daughters in apprentichip somewhere since there father had died and they were running low on money.  She set's up Martha with the local witch to learn magic because Martha is the youngest and her fortune will most likely be grander if she learns from a witch.  She than sets up Lettie in a bakery where she would be bound to \\"meet handsome young apprentices and live happily every after\\". That leaves Sophie, the eldest and least likely to succeed.  Mother decides to take Sophie in as her own apprentice for her Hat Shop.  At first, Sophie tries to make herself happy by puting all her energy in making and decorating hats but soon, she begins to feel very depressed at how dull her life is looking.  She believes that she will never leave the hatshop and will grow old and withered without having any adventures of her own.  She begins talking to the hats she makes and as the days pass, she becomes more and more of a recluse.  However, one day, a powerful witch enters her Hat Shop and for some reason or other curses her and she becomes an old lady.  This event sets Sophie on a new path, in which she encounters more magic and adventure than she thought an eldest daughter could ever have.   <br /> <br />Diana Wynne Jones writes out the very funny, odd, magical adventure of Sophie as she determines to seek out her fortune and break the curse before it is too late.  This book was a startlingly interesting read for me, as I thought this book would be boring since it seemed to be written for a younger reader.  However, I found this book surprisingly and uniquely fun and I throughly enjoyed Sophie's wonderfully entertaining adventure.  I especially liked the character of Calcifer and Howl, and there strange bargain of a relationship. I definitely recommend this book, to readers everwhere.  If I couldn't help but read the book at in one sitting, it must be pretty enthralling. So read it!	2005-01-09

Sookie Stackhouse is a waitress at the local bar of a small town in Louisiana.  People in her town think she's a little nuts, but that's because Sookie has a little secret of her own.  She can read minds.  However, she doesn't like to, so she keeps a barrier up in her own head to block out the boring voices that is the minds of other people.  One night, a mysterious stranger appears at her bar.  She is instantly fascinated by his 'glow' and instantly classes him as a vampire.  However, others in her small town notice that too and they are up to no good. After saving the vampire (Bill) from a near 'draining', Sookie finds herself caught up in a life she never imagined she would have and discovers things below the surface of her normal-looking town.  Involving (of course) vampires, other supernatural, mystery, suspense, thrill, romance, and humour, Charlaine Harris creates a new, and intriguing story that I found hard to put down.	2005-01-08

This story is about Elena Klovis, a girl who was destined to be a Cinderella in her kingdom. However, a twist of fate lands her with a job as a fairy godmother to her kingdom. From then on, countless adventures come her way, along with a spoiled, rude, arrogant prince who she is determined to change for the better.   <br /> <br />To me, Elena wasn't a particularly special heroine.  She just didn't seem that interesting even though she was a fairy godmother. However, I thought this story was still quite enjoyable.  It is a book that you would read on a long lazy day when you have nothing else to do.  If you are looking for a special,  interesting book, try another before you read this one.	2005-01-08

Sarah Dessen is a great writer, check out her other books.      Colie is a girl who used to be fat and ugly and considered [...].  She was an outcast, and never stuck around long enough to make any real friends.  Her mother used to be fat as well, until she began an aerobics program. Eventually, her mother  became famous and had to tour in Europe so she sent Colie to spend a nice summer with aunt Mira.      I liked this story, because it encourages people to 'stand up for themselves'.  Colie took in every insult that came her way and didn't do anything about it.  She let herself be put down and felt sorry for herself.  In other words, she was like a kicked dog.  The summer she spends at last Chance Bar and Grill changes  her life, as she slowly gains courage and confidence in herself to finally kick back.      If you are looking for a light romantic, lazy-summer-day read, this is a good pick.  It is a story about finding courage and strength to fight back and believe in yourself.	2005-01-04

All the characters were irritating and annoying, I didn't like any of them (especially not Zenpfenning and Utricacea).  The plot was so utterly annoying!  It made me want to pull out my hair! I guess it was supposed to be funny and witty but it seriously was more annoying than humourous.  Rebecca Lickiss turned a simple little conflict (of the princes needing a princess's kiss to break a spell) into a whole novel.  It was stupid how Vevila (who was supposedly a head strong girl) could not do something so simple as push the witch aside and kiss the stupid princes.  Overall, this book was really annoying to read and I was unfortunate enough to buy it.	2004-12-31

She complains alot about her life too, and that just doesn't help make this book better to read.  Another thing is that (like someone mentioned already) the fact that two killings by two different groups of people in the same week doesn't seem credible.  I also didn't like how Anita kept Richard hanging, and I can't believe she agreed to date Jean-Claude.  Overall, this book wasn't that great, the plot was okay so I rate it three stars.	2004-12-31

I really couldn't read it though.  I tried pushing my way through the first few chapters but I found it too tedious to read.  I even wondered if this book would be better if I had started with the first book of this series or trilogy (w/e).  Anyhow, this book is a bit too, I don't know...modernish?....sci-fi-ish?  Another thing I didn't like about this book was the names which really emphasize my above question.  Some books are better off left closed.	2004-12-31

Sherwood Smith is an excellent writer, her style of writing lets the reader feel like she herself is Meliara.

I was a bit skeptical at first, since I don't usually read fantasy, but once I began the book, I couldn't put it down. After Sabriel, I read Lirael (2nd book) and it was just as great and even more creative! In Abhorsen, I was amazed! I am the kind of reader who gets easily caught up in the book, so for the moment while I was reading, I was anxious for Lirael, Dog, Mogget and Sam while they sought to fufill their mission. There are a many surprises in this book, so if you have already read the other, don't hesitate to pick this one up! If you are as skeptical as I was about starting this trilogy, don't be. Just read this book, you will not be disappointed!	2004-12-30

Lirael is by far the best book out of the trilogy.  I think Garth Nix really went all out in creativity in this book and that was what I found captivated me the most.  I love this world that he has created (though I wouldn't want to live in it), and I love how Lirael enters the story.  Garth Nix definitely succeeded in bringing in the element of mystery and apocolytic-ness into the story that makes the story seem out of this world (which it is).  By the way, to all readers, if you liked the first two books, the third book is a must and is a great reward to read.  ( the ending almost made me cry and I felt that pang in my heart)	2004-12-26

This book is wonderful, especially for YA readers as it contains adventure, romance, mystery and much more.  I've read many books in my life time, and I have to say that the character of Claidi was well-done.  Tanith Lee managed to create a unique character that is witty, interesting and humourous.  I don't think Claidi is supposed to be a realistic character but an interesting character that would captivate the reader's interest.  To me, Claidi's character is refreshingly new, and one of my favorite characters.   <br />I also love the diary style in which Tanith Lee chose to write the book.  <br />Overall, this book definitely merits *****.  It is not boring, unfocused or plucky.  Though I do like Gail Carson Levine and Tamora Pierce, I still think that the character of Claidi is far more interesting than Ella or Alanna simply because it is new and refreshing to read.   <br />So, if you are interested in reading something totally new and out of this world, read Claidi journals, and enjoy a wonderful world of fantasy and adventure. <br />	2004-12-26
