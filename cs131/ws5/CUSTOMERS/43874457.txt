Childers addresses this issue openly. She argues in her book that even though preaching is *not* acting, preaching can learn from actors.<br /><br />Childers believes that preaching is not merely sharing a sermon manuscript, but rather is a transforming and theological event. Unlike acting though, preaching is a serious matter that involves theology. The problem is that preachers often times lack passion. She quotes Thomas Betterton  saying, \\"Actors speak of things imaginary as if they were real, while you preachers too often speak of things real as if they were imaginary.\\"<br /><br />Theology is important to preaching-they work together in a \\"dialectical relationship, one shaping the other.\\" (p. 25) Theology keeps preaching focused on matters of ultimate importance. There are three categories in defining the purpose of preaching: maintenance, persuasion, and encounter with God. Childers prefers the encounter model of preaching because she sees preaching as revealing God, even though this model does not exclude maintenance or persuasion.<br /><br />Rather than trying to argue people into heaven, we should use lively preaching so that listeners are not on the defensive and to help people feel free to change. Preachers have often focused too much on the manuscript at the expense of the actual preaching event.<br /><br />Preaching is an art form. According to Childers, the church often overlooks art as merely a tool to be used. We tend to think of art as novelty or propaganda. But art is more than that-it is the stuff of life.  Preaching is an art form because it uncovers the ambiguities and incongruencies of life. Preaching and art both hold a \\"mirror up to life.\\"<br /><br />Some elements of theater are applicable to preaching:<br /><br />1) Actions (or movement),<br /><br />2) Distance (prevents people from going on defensive),<br /><br />3) Performance --One problem is that many people are concerned with preachers performing. But performing means to \\"carry though to completion\\" Paying attention to performance means increasing intentionality which heightens authenticity.<br /><br />Childers describes the three parts of the creative process in theological terms. The first phase is \\"Creation\\" which is when the preacher listens to what the text says. Incarnation is the second phase when the preacher joins with the text and becomes a third entity, just as the actor joins the script and becomes a new being. The third phase is \\"Transformation\\" which is a result of the union and changes the preacher.<br /><br />Childers reviews some exercises that preachers can use in training for performance. She emphasizes the importance of voice training. A lot of people think that voice training will make them sound fake, but she says that, \\"The goal of voice work, in fact, is quite the opposite: to uncover the best you, the most natural you.\\" (p. 60)<br /><br />Following voice training is the subject of vocalics, or orchestration. Four elements of vocalics are rate, pitch, volume and the use of pauses. The key to good orchestration is variety. She shares a few good tips on pausing. Emphasis is also important for clarifying the meaning of a message. Changing the word that is emphasized can change the meaning of a sentence.<br /><br />When a preacher reads a passage that is going to be expounded, he should imagine what kind of movement will express the flow of the text, and what kind of gestures depict it.<br /><br />Like actors, preachers should internalize what they are reading. They should express the emotions of the text, and not sound like a \\"stained-glass-window voice.\\" Childers talks about principles of interpretation when it comes to performing the Word. These include the willingness to listen to the text and subordinate our will to the will of the text.<br /><br />Another critical element is that of concentration. Preachers tendto have the glazed gaze when they look at their audiences. They need to focus on what they are doing at the moment and \\"listen\\" to their audience.<br /><br />Finally, Childers talks about the role of plot and blocking in preaching. Plot applies both to the sermon and the worship service itself. It has conflict, climax and resolution. And blocking can be applied to preaching because it makes sure that the audience can see what is going on.<br /><br />See also my review on \\"Comedy and Preaching\\" by Joseph M.

Preaching was also the first priority to the apostles, as stated in Acts 6. Stott goes on to show how preaching was the greatest priority for the great church leaders of history, and that it was the expounding of Scripture that led the Reformation. He also says that it is when preaching God's truths is neglected that the church falls into darkness and loses its power and spirituality.<br /><br />Stott answers the objections to preaching in our times. There are three main objections to preaching. The problems are the atmosphere of anti-authority, the \\"cybernetics revolution\\" and the loss of confidence in the gospel. It is argued that people do not want to hear preachers talking as if they are the authority on truth and are suspicious of the \\"institution\\" or \\"establishment\\" because of its \\"entrenched privilege or unassailable power.\\" However, Stott points out though that Christ himself was somewhat of an anti-establishment figure himself. The environment is different these days because most everybody is educated and has an opinion, and pastors are no longer distinguished by their education. Nevertheless, Stott believes that people actually do want some clear guidance, though they may not want to hear some arrogant person trying to shove their opinions on other people. What they are really looking for is truth that resonates in their soul, that comes from God along and His authority, and convicts their hearts through the Holy Spirit-not just some other person's opinion. What they really need is only found in the authority of God's Word. (This was insightful.) This is a primary reason for why Stott believes expository preaching is very important and still relevant, even in these \\"post-modern\\" times. The sermon is supposed to be a revelation of God's message to His people, not merely the preacher's own opinion. He says, \\"The sermon is by its very nature a revelation, not an exhortation.\\"<br /><br />Another problem that people see with preaching is its relevance. Many people do not see the gospel as relevant to their lives. In order for it to be relevant to the lives of other people, it has to first affect the life of the preacher and that must be evident. Preachers can be more relevant by answering the questions that people have and dealing with the issues they face in their daily lives.<br /><br />Stott also describes how the use of technology in communication has made an impact on attention span of audiences. People wonder if preaching is still an effective means of communicating with people. The book is somewhat dated because the Internet revolution had not even taken off when Stott wrote it, but he was perceptive enough to see the effect of computers and technology on communication. However, Stott argues that nothing will ever replace face-to-face communication. Stott argues that the sermon is the only effective way of fulfilling the diving imperative of communicating God's messages to his church in a relevant way. I also agree with his point about how television produces a mass-culture where people turn off their brains and merely accept what is being said, without using the necessary critical faculties. Nevertheless, we cannot take television away and it is here to stay-preachers have to be able to captivate their audience's attention.<br /><br />The third problem that Stott deals with is the loss of confidence in the Gospel (not to mention the Bible). We need to believe that the Gospel has the power to give people better lives. If the preacher does not believe in what he is preaching, then he should not be preaching.<br /><br />Stott's chapter on the theology of preaching was my other favorite chapter. The idea of preaching is based on several convictions. The first conviction is that God is light and truth and wants to be revealed. The second conviction is that God has taken the initiative to reveal himself through the course of history. The third conviction is that God has not merely communicated through nature, but that he has actually spoken through his Word. Stott believes that God's historical action and explanatory words go hand-in-hand. It is only because God has given us a message that we can speak with authority and not of our own opinion.<br /><br />There are three convictions related to Scripture that serve as a foundation of Biblical preaching. The first is that God has spoken through Scripture. Even though they are not his direct words, the Bible claims that God inspired the writers of the Bible and they wrote what they learned in their own words. Jesus quoted from the Old Testament showing that he also believed in the authority of Scripture. We must believe that the Bible is not merely a \\"good book\\" but that it is an authoritative source of Truth that helps us understand God and the world around us. The second is that he still speaks through Scripture. We must also believe that Scripture is still relevant to us today, and that it has power to change lives. How does it have power to change lives? Because truth is a mighty force, capable of starting and stopping war when nothing else is as powerful. This is fundamental to the Christian faith. The Christian church depends on the authority of Scripture. When we preach, we are to preach with the authority of God by expounding on His messages as revealed through Scripture written by humans. Preaching caused the Reformation and the greatest spiritual revivals.<br /><br />The pastor's role is as a shepherd who is responsible for guarding the spirituality of the church congregation and keeping them connected to God.  As shepherds, they are responsible for the spiritual nourishment of the congregation through teaching and preaching.<br /><br />Stott defines preaching as bridge building. It builds a bridge between the past, historical context and the truths contained in Scripture, connecting it to the present times in a contemporary context, thus the importance of exegesis and hermeneutics. He goes into the subject of Biblical exegesis and expository preaching. For a book that deals with preaching based on properly interpreting the Bible, see my review on \\"Biblical Preaching\\" by Robbinson. (ISBN 0801022622) The chapter on preparing sermons was mostly review for me.<br /><br />We also must come to Scripture with expectancy-a hope that we will find something that God will speak to us through. However, Stott is concerned about preachers who spend all their time in their study without some practical real-world experience. He says that we should also study other things besides the Bible so we can know how to connect the Bible to modern-times.<br /><br />Stott goes on to emphasize the importance of sincerity and earnestness. People want to know that we are honest, real people who really care about what we are talking about. He mentions that humor, when used properly, can be a powerful tool for breaking down defenses and connecting people on an emotional level.

Knight draws on his early struggle with legalism. His objective is to clarify SDA teachings on sanctification and perfection that are often misunderstood.<br /><br />NOTE: Seventh-day Adventists teach that we are saved (go to heaven) only by the grace of God (sola gracia), a free gift made possible by the atoning death of Jesus (sola Christe), which is accepted only by faith (sola fide). This faith is expressed in obedience to God's Law of Love, though obedience is made possibly only through faith in Christ and the working of the Holy Spirit.<br /><br />Unfortunately, legalism is a problem that transcends ALL denominations.<br /><br />Drawing on personal experience, George Knight teaches his readers how to avoid falling into the pit of legalism. Knight seeks to clearly define sin, salvation, God's law, justification, sanctification, and perfection to resolve issues that arise from misunderstanding these concepts. He describes the fundamental problem with humanity as putting self first, instead of yielding to God. All the doctrines of salvation have to do with dying to self, and letting God reign in our lives.<br /><br />He writes, \\"Being saved is choosing to put God and His will back into the center of our lives.\\" (p. 22)<br /><br />Knight notes that Adventists often see themselves as emphasizing God's law.  Yet, the author writes that while many Adventists might look at the commandments of God, some tend to overlook the underlying fundamental principle of Love. \\"We can be quite zealous in keeping God's laws while utterly and totally failing in keeping God's LAW,\\" writes Knight. (p. 36)  Thus, there are some Adventists who know how to keep the Sabbath and observe health principles and yet neglect the most important principles of all, to love others and God completely.  Christianity is meant to be a \\"positive\\" religion, rather than a \\"negative\\" or \\"rules\\" religion. \\"No one will ever be saved because of what he or she has not done,\\" (p. 35) but rather because of our love for God and others.<br /><br />George Knight also looks at the reverse side of justification and sanctification that we tend to take for granted. He states that justification is not just the work of a moment, but also the work of a lifetime.  And sanctification is not only the work of a lifetime, but also the work of a moment.  Initial justification is when we have faith in God's grace and the death of Jesus covering our sins. Justification happened on the cross, but we must accept it in faith.  Faith, or a \\"yes\\" relationship with God (p. 22), is \\"grabbing hold of what we don't deserve,\\" writes Knight. (p. 43) When we are initially justified by faith, we are also adopted into the family of God, because we no longer reject or resist Him. But, as Knight puts it, \\"God does not bounce us in and out of salvation, in and out of His family, because we have momentary or accidental or inadvertant sins.\\" (p. 46)  We must remember that we need continuous forgiveness of sins.  Because of this, \\"Daily justification is closely tied to Christ's ministry on our behalf in the heavenly sanctuary.\\" (p. 43)<br /><br />Sanctification is not just a lifetime pursuit, it is also instant. \\"That becomes clear when we realize that the very meaning of sanctification is `to be set apart for holy use,'\\" writes Knight. (p. 46) He adds, \\"In the New Testament a saint is one who is sanctified, one who is set apart for holy use, one who is consecrated to God.\\" (p. 46)  Knight demonstrates a few Bible passages that refer to sanctification as a past event. Once we accept God in faith, we are sanctified, or consecrated.  But the Bible calls us to maturity in our relationship with God. The author writes, \\"If `initial' sanctification sets us apart for holy use, then `progressive' sanctification is what the Bible writers refer to as `growth in grace.' While initial sanctification is instantaneous, progressive sanctification is the work of a lifetime.\\" (p. 48) Thus, \\"progressive sanctification\\" is continuous.<br /><br />Having \\"daily justification\\" and \\"progressive sanctification\\" implies that humans will struggle with temptations and sins until we are resurrected and recreated. In writing about temptation, Knight could have clarified temptation by explaining that there is a difference between being tempted and giving in to temptation.  Being tempted is okay (it means \\"tested\\"), but giving in to temptation is a sin.  Knight describes how Jesus was tempted in far greater ways than we can imagine, but he never sinned.  We are tempted to put our will in control of our lives instead of God's will. Because we are constantly tempted to follow our own desires, we must constantly die to ourselves and \\"crucify\\" our will. Knight writes, \\"The New Testament imperative is the crucifixion of self-centeredness for every individual disciple of Christ, coupled with a new life to be lived in resurrection power.\\" (p. 63)<br /><br />Finally, the biggest misunderstanding that we tend to have is about what perfection means in the Bible. The root of the problem is that \\"people bring their own definitions of perfection to the Bible rather than letting the Bible define perfection for them.\\" (p. 72)  While it is true that Christ's perfection and righteousness stands in place of ours in the final judgment, God still calls Christians to perfect their characters.  Knight points out some Bible texts that speak of \\"a dynamic process of character development in which people really do become more and more like their `heavenly Father.'\\" (p. 70) However, \\"perfect\\" must not be understood in absolute terms. \\"Being perfect is a dynamic state in which dedicated Christians continue to advance in Christian living.\\"<br />(p. 79) It \\"does not mean either absolute perfection or absolute sinlessness.  But it does mean being free from an attitude of rebellion toward the Father and His principles set forth in the LAW of love.\\" (p. 80)<br /><br />The book raised my awareness about the importance of character perfection, with the understanding that perfection is not a point to be reached, but rather the pursuit of becoming more loving towards God and others.<br /><br />The book is very clear and straightforward.  Knight's writing style is intellectual and engaging. The author has a great ability for absorbing the best ideas of many great writers and making them all accessible to the reader in a single compilation. He also adds a touch of humor to occassionally spice up his writing.  However, the book tends to be repetitive (though that could also be a good thing for people who might not grasp a concept the first time) and at times a little too abstract.  It could have benefited from more concrete illustrations and life experiences to bring all the theory down to practical terms.<br /><br />As I read this book from beginning to end, I was impressed by George Knight's insight into the subject of salvation. It was great to know that the author had struggled with being a legalist himself for awhile, so he had experience with looking at the subject from both perspectives.  His insights help to give a full, complete picture of God's grace and love, and what He expects of us.<br /><br />See also my reviews on \\"Luther the Reformer\\" (ISBN 0800635973) and \\"A Real Christian: The Life of John Wesley\\" (ISBN 0687082463).ssive sanctification\\" is continuous.

Sedentarization is shown to be associated with the process of food system intensification.<br /><br />Nomadization is the process whereby a group of people gradually adopts a nomadic mode of existence. Nomadization is linked to the process of food system abatement.<br /><br />In order to understand the processes of sedentarization and nomadization, the impact of the physical environment on the food systems must be explored. There are several environmental influences.<br /><br />The first influence is the climate and geology. The most characteristic feature of the Middle East is the summer droughts. It also develops the most extreme temperatures, alternating between some of the coldest temperatures on earth and very hot, dry weather. This results in evaporation and water shortages. There is also a close proximity between deserts and fertile lands.<br /><br />The second influence on the food system is topography and hydrology. The rivers in the lowlands and piedmonts resulted in irrigation agriculture. In places where there is little rain, moisture-maximizing dry-farming techniques are employed. This is also mixed with pastoralism, or raising sheep and goats on nearby mountain slopes and desert pastures. The topography and hydrology also affect two patterns of migration involved in food production: vertical migration (transhumance) and horizontal migration (plains). Transhumance is the seasonal movement between lowlands to highlands in search of pasture. Horizontal migration involves nomads who have to move longer distances in search of water and pasture for their animals. However, these strategies do not operate independently of each other. They often work in cooperation with each other.<br /><br />Thirdly, plants and animals influence human mobility. Certain types of plants require yearly attention and is not conducive to nomadization. On the other hand, pasture animals are more mobile. Camels are used because they are able to travel distances without much water.<br /><br />There are three structural mechanisms that play a part in dealing with the environment: tribal organization, political allegiance, and shared ideals.<br /><br />Tribal organization is important because to belong to a particular tribe meant to belong to a social entity which specialized in or had control over particular natural resources or areas of subsistence. In rural households, the process of sedentarization tends to be directly promoted by the policies and actions of the political powers. Nomadization is often a form of resistance, or a form of natural response by the rural population to the exploitative undertakings of the urban elites.re animals are more mobile.

The word \\"sanctification\\" is translated from the Greek word \\"hagiasmos\\",  meaning \\"holiness.\\"  In the literal definition, to sanctify means to make holy.  But in the spiritual sense, a person cannot become holier without the help of someone who is holy, God.  In Sanctified Life, Ellen White defines more clearly what sanctification is, the necessity for it, and the process by which God sanctifies Christians.<br /><br />The publisher states under \\"A Word to the Reader\\" that the book is a compilation of what was originally a series of articles in the Review and Herald on the subject. It is important to understand the context in which these writings were produced to better understand her intended audience. The language used by the author suggests that she was targeting people who misunderstand what sanctification is, and who claim to be \\"holy\\" while not demonstrating a godly spirit.<br /><br />The emphasis of the book is established in the opening sentence: \\"The sanctification set forth in the Sacred Scriptures has to do with the entire being-spirit, soul, and body.\\"  (p7)  In contrast with the focuses of other popular theories of her day, Ellen White establishes that sanctification should be holistic, not just changing external behavior, but transforming the mental, physical and moral power. (p. 25-26)<br /><br />The first chapter defines the difference between true and false sanctification.  False sanctification consists of \\"talk and will worship\\" and deals mostly with external behavior.  The true version involves a complete transformation of the entire self, even while that person may still feel his or her own weaknesses.  As Ellen White puts it, \\"The nearer they approach to His divine image, the more clearly will they discern its spotless perfection, and the more deeply will they feel their own defects.\\" (p. 7)<br /><br />Based on reading the rest of the book, Ellen White's definition of true sanctification is summed up as follows.  She writes, \\"True sanctification is an entire conformity to the will of God.\\" (p. 9) It cannot be measured by emotion (p. 10); it is what happens when Christians are transformed by the love of Christ. (p. 54)  The author explains, \\"There may be marked defects in the character of an individual, yet when he becomes a true disciple of Jesus, the power of divine grace makes him a new creature.  Christ's love transforms, sanctifies him.\\" (p. 55)<br /><br />Furthermore, she states that, though obedience comes as a natural result of God's love transforming us, sanctification is not possible without obedience. (p. 67)  Ellen White notes that holistic sanctification is what the apostle Paul meant when he urged Christians to present their bodies \\"a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God.\\" (p. 27)  It is a \\"daily work, continuing as long as life shall last,\\" (p. 10) and a progressive work (p. 94), which means it does not happen overnight.<br /><br />Perhaps the best feature about Ellen White's work is that she illustrates all of the above points through the experiences of Bible characters notable for their devotion and love for God.<br /><br />The three main characters that she focuses on are Daniel, John, and Paul.<br /><br />I feel the only downside of Sanctified Life is that it may be harsh in the beginning for readers who already know their weaknesses and are looking for help in overcoming them. For example, she writes early in the book about the \\"idolatry\\" of tobacco use.  But considering the author's time period, tobacco was widely used and the dangers were mostly unknown, making her principles more significant and bold then. Nevertheless, it seems unsympathetic to people today who know the dangers and yet struggle to quit their powerful addictions.<br /><br />While some people may overcome sins on will-power alone, others who struggle with addictive sins also need the power of God's Holy Spirit to liberate them (and maybe some professional help too).

We use this as a textbook in our hermeneutics class at Andrews Univ.<br /><br />Unfortunately, we disagree with the theology of the old and new covenants being different. This theology is reflected throughout the book.<br /><br />I happen to believe that people have always been saved by faith. The old covenant was anticipatory, a shadow of things to come. The new covenant is based on the historical reality of Christ, and writes God's laws on our hearts as a result.<br /><br />Despite our theological differences, there is no better book that teaches proper exegesis in easy to understand language. My denomination has a \\"Handbook of Bible Study\\" but it is too technical for beginning students because it explores textual criticism and the original languages. \\"Grasping God's Word\\" is easy enough to be understood by lay people, though I wouldn't want to use it with new members who could be confused by different theology.	2005-04-18

Scholasticism was a movement that began in the Middle Ages which sought to find a systematic and rational justification to the Christian faith. Most of it was a systematic replay of Augustinian teachings organized by Aristotle's philosophies.<br /><br />There are two main subdivisions of scholasticism, which can be associated with two time periods. The first part of the scholastic period was dominated by realism, while the later part by nominalism. Realism said that universals were entities of themselves, while nominalism said that universal concepts are not real. Proponents of Realism included Thomas Aquinas and Duns Scotus.<br /><br />There were two forms of Nominalism: the via moderna and the schola Augustiniana moderna. The common feature was only that they were both anti-realism. The two schools reflect the debate between Pelagianism and Augustianism, over the ability of humans to merit salvation. The via moderna tended toward the positions of Pelagius and the schola Augustiniana towards that of Augustine.<br /><br />The theology of the via moderna was dominated by a covenant between God and humans in which humans, when people followed their conscience and \\"did their best\\" they could somehow obligate God to accepting them based on the terms of the covenant. Human works were of little inherent value. But God had promised, through the covenant, to treat them as if they were of much greater value.<br /><br />The theology of the schola Augustiniana reflected the views of Augustine that humans are totally depraved. Salvation is totally the work of God, from the beginning to its end. This view may have influenced Calvin.<br /><br />While it appears that Martin Luther's new theology seems to stand at the end of a long tradition of Augustinian teachings, they were different. It does not appear that Luther was ever directly influenced by the schola Augustiniana, but was reacting to via moderna.<br /><br />Prior to the Reformation, the concepts of justification and grace were very vague. There had been no authoritative pronouncement from the church for over a thousand years.  The rise of humanism raised the question, \\"What must I, as an individual, do to be saved?\\"<br /><br />Luther initially studied and followed the via moderna, which was the philosophy that God was obliged to justify anyone who humbles themselves before God and does what lies within them (quod is se est).<br /><br />Luther realized that he was not capable of meeting the preconditions for justification. Luther \\"re-discovered\\" Augustine's doctrine of total depravity, the belief that humans are incapable of saving themselves and require God's intervention.<br /><br />Luther's difference with Augustine was where God's grace was to arise. He believed God's grace was alien or \\"forensic\\" to the person, whereas Augustine saw grace as something that was planted in the person that caused a change. Augustine believed that this caused an imparted righteousness, a righteousness that grows within and justifies the person, whereas Luther and Melancthon believed righteousness was imputed, or declared by God. Luther called a believer \\"simul iustus et peccator\\", meaning simultanouesly righteous, yet a sinner.<br /><br />Whereas most Catholic theologians would have claimed that we are justified by grace, and would even go so far as to say that grace is received by faith, Luther stood out by declaring that faith is the ONLY means of receiving that grace, and not by anything we do. He added the \\"alone\\" to \\"justificationby grace through faith alone.\\"<br /><br />When Luther taught that salvation was personal and attacked the sacerdotal system with his \\"priesthood of all believers\\" doctrine, it took the leverage out of the Church's whole economic support system (indulgences).<br /><br />Some people charged Luther with being antinomian (lawless), but Luther believed that obedience to God's law was the result of faith. Faith does not merely believe that something is true, but also acts on that belief and relies on it. However, works are not the cause of justification, it is the result of it.<br /><br />Another battle cry of the Reformation was the call to return to Scripture, or the Bible (Sola Scriptura). This doctrine challenged the accepted role of tradition in the process of interpreting Scripture.<br /><br />The Catholic Church raised some valid questions for the new approaches to Scripture.  First, Sola Scriptura seemed insufficient considering that almost all heresies claimed the Scripture in their defense. The Catholic Church argued that the Scriptures could not be interpreted in any way, but rather within the context of the historical continuity of the Church.<br /><br />The Reformers emphasized the Bible as the sole authority and that the Church derived its authority from the Bible. While Catholics stressed the importance of historical continuity, Protestants emphasized the importance of doctrinal continuity.he \\"alone\\" to \\"justification by grace through faith alone.\\"  <br /> <br />When Luther taught that salvation was personal and attacked the sacerdotal system with his \\"priesthood of all believers\\" doctrine, it took the leverage out of the Church's whole economic support system (indulgences). <br /> <br />Some people charged Luther with being antinomian (lawless), but Luther believed that obedience to God's law was the result of faith.

If you want to understand how Wesley developed his theology, or how he matured and developed spiritually, then this is an excellent book.<br /><br />This book was my introduction to the life of Wesley, but the book may be more suited for people who already have some exposure to this important person.<br /><br />The author's goal is to go beyond telling Wesley's life story to focusing on his theology.<br /><br />The back cover description:<br />\\"[the book] fills a void in available books in Wesleyan-Methodist studies by providing a brief, solid biography that focuses on Wesley himself. At the same time as exploring Wesley's ancestry, birth, death, and every major biographical and theological even between, the theme of the book explorers John Wesley's spiritual growth and maturation.\\"<br /><br />In other words, the book primarily deals with Wesley's ancestry, birth, death and a few of the major events in his life, but mostly deals with a development of his theology, though the book talks mainly about the subject of Christian perfection, rather than holiness.<br /><br />The author's writing style can be slow at times, with some run-away sentences. Sentences can average 5-6 lines each. If you're new to John Wesley like I was, then you may want to start with another introduction.<br /><br />If you're looking for a book that details the development of Wesley's theology on Christian perfection as well as faith and assurance of salvation, then this is the book for you. This book is a good theological history.	2005-04-15

He was the father of the Protestant reformation. Many of the reformers looked to him as inspiration, if nothing else. He also promoted the pillars of the Reformation: sola scriptura, sola fide, sola sacerdos, sola gracia, and sola Christe. He changed how people relate to God and impact people's daily lives. People denounced monastic vows and embraced marriage. Luther single-handedly weakened the power of the Catholic Church. By teaching Scripture, he undermined the sale of indulgences, destroyed the Church's sacramental system and undermined its ecclesiastical authority. The Church would be forced to clarify its teachings at the Council of Trent, which would push it farther away from the possibility of reform.<br /><br />After just reading a tortorous biography on John Wesley, this biography was much better. Even while Kittleson discussed theology, he kept it interesting and in context.	2005-04-15

These people would have had some oral traditions to compare it to right? They would have been pretty stupid to believe something that didn't square with their history. What about the later prophets such as Isaiah who refer frequently to the Exodus as a symbol of God's power...What good is the Exodus if it never happened?<br /><br />Why go through all the trouble to concoct a story that is *actually* rather embarrassing to them because it describes their constant whining. If they really wanted to make up a bogus story, then they would probably want to make them look more like heroes, put in some action-packed adventures of how they kicked Egyptian butt, and triumphantly created a nation, rather than wandering around lost in a desert for 40 years and losing in battles. As far as we can tell, most \\"revisionist history\\" likes to paint pretty pictures, not bad pictures. Can you think of many nations who glorify their defeats? Some try to erase all evidence and not mention them in their textbooks. As another reviewer put it, these theories only raise more questions than they attempt to answer.<br /><br />Having spent time on an archaeological expedition in the Near East, I have found that archaeology is somewhat subjective. This author cites a few select people who take something that is unclear, does a lot of guesswork and speculates based on that guesswork. We end up with competing versions of how the Exodus happened if it happened at all.<br /><br />Despite the author's attempted conclusion, I realized that the Exodus really might have happened after all, considering all the circumstances and the evidence discovered so far. But, it seems that critics still want to downplay the evidence so they come up with more unsubstantiated speculation to throw more confusion on the subject.<br /><br />Finally, the author said that the Exodus could not have happened because it would have been impossible: \\"Putting aside the possibility of divinely inspired miracles, one can hardly accept the idea of a flight of a large group of slaves from Egypt through the heavily guarded border fortifications into the desert and then into Canaan in the time of such a formidable Egyptian presence.\\"<br /><br />The whole point of the Exodus account is that it was impossible without a miracle from God!<br /><br />The author uses the old argument that if the Exodus *really* happened, we would have found evidence for it by now. This is a classic \\"atheist-of-the-gaps\\" argument, that because there's no evidence, it must mean it never happened. But, as archaeologists continue to work, they continue to find new evidence to disappoint critics.<br /><br />Skeptics used to doubt the Bible's description of ancient cities of Babylon and Nineveh, until they unearthed them.

(The Bible has many warnings about that too.)<br /><br />If you really want to learn about the \\"Faith of Our Founding Fathers\\" from a scholarly source by somebody who actually has researched facts, then I recommend an accurate and fair (and enjoyable) book instead called, \\"The Founding Fathers and the Place of Religion in America\\" by Frank Lambert instead. (ISBN 0691088292)<br /><br />Yes, the U.S. colonies were established primarily as Christian colonies. However, there were so many disagreements in beliefs, that the states ended up persecuting people who preached different doctrines. People were being hung in Massachusetts because of their beliefs, and that was why Roger Williams left to found Rhode Island, a state that tolerated different religions.<br /><br />In Virginia, Baptists preachers were thrown in prison because they disagreed with the established Anglican church. One of the people impacted by this was James Madison, who himself had attended a presbyterian seminary. His first action as a freshman lawmaker in Virginia was to fight for the rights of religious minorities. He became a decisive force for the separation of church and state.<br /><br />Because of the persecution of religious minorities and the efforts by the established churches to silence dissent, the popular attitude was to hate the established churches, because they were seen as power-hungry and corrupt (like some today). That is why people like Madison and Jefferson fought for the creation of a secular government that \\"deregulated\\" churches and created a free-market of religious ideas.<br /><br />Yes, there were other people (like Patrick Henry) who wanted to establish a Christian church, but guess who won in the end?

Books	1	94	140	N	N	As a Christian, I object to these distortions	This book by David Barton is full of distortions that I could not possibly use the book for any research. Small &quot;quote-lets&quot; are constantly taken out of context and used to say the *opposite* of what the original authors intended. Barton makes several lists of people who &quot;support&quot; ideas by taking small quotes out of context that sound good, when the Barton is really stretching their use.<br />One small example, Barton uses the quote from James Madison saying &quot;Religion...[is] the basis and foundation of government,&quot; which I happen to agree with. But he uses this quote in a different context to say that Madison would support the cooperation of church and state. This could NOT be farther from the truth. Madison was raised in a Christian home and attended a Presbyterian seminary, but his first initiative as a freshman lawmaker was legislation that protected the rights of religious minorities. He was perhaps the most decisive force shaping the First Amendment's religion clauses. Madison dedicated his life to separating church and state.<br />Barton even uses the ridiculous assertion that the 1st Amendment is in common with article 52 of the former Soviet Union, thus painting it Communist, when in fact, this document was drafted over a century AFTER the U.S. Constitution was written!<br />I also agree with this: &quot;Religious Right propagandist David Burton claimed in his self-published 1989 book The Myth of Separation that later in the [Danbury] letter Jefferson wrote that the wall of separation was meant to be 'one directional,' protecting the church from the state but not the other way around. Barton also alleged that Jefferson added that 'Christian principles' should always guide government. These assertions appear nowhere in the letter, and Barton corrected the errors in later editions-although he continues to dismiss the letter as unimportant and distort its contents and meaning in other ways.<br />&quot;One scholar who has studied Jefferson and church-state separation says Religious Right leaders fail to grasp the significance of the Danbury letter because they don't understand or will not acknowledge its historical context.&quot;<br />* As a Christian, I MUST ask my fellow Christians: If our Founding Fathers believed that religion has a role in government, then why doesn't the Constitution mention God anywhere? The only place religion is mentioned is in the negative, that religion cannot be a test of public office.<br />My fellow Christians, it IS true that most of the Colonies were established as Christian colonies, but let us NOT be ignorant of the historical results. The fact is that persecution resulted and the majority in society abhored the power-hungry churches. Guess what happened as a result? Our founders established a secular government that &quot;deregulated&quot; religion and created a free market of religious ideas. Even the Preamble to the Constitution states that the authority of the government rests in the people, like a social contract, rather than deriving its authority from God.<br />My fellow Christians, why do we need to rely on civil power to encourage morality? I get suspicious of other churches when they become power-hungry. Why must we entangle ourselves in the domain of government? At a critical time in the formation of Christianity as a growing movement, neither Jesus nor his apostles relied on civic power. In fact, the church grew *despite* opposition and persecution from government.<br />My fellow Christians, why must the church seek to coerce the moral decision-making of others? Why must we rely on government-instituted schools to teach morality, enforce prayer and indoctrinate religious teachings? The very people who tout the importance of &quot;family&quot; are passing off their responsibilities. Shouldn't the &quot;family&quot; be responsible for moral training? Isn't it &quot;legalistic&quot; to resort to political power and legislation to enforce morality? Myhumble opinion.My humble opinion.	2004-04-23

This 10th anniversary edition adds the latest advances in science and technology in the last decade and adds a new chapter on the subject of time travel and wormholes. (This is my rehash.)<br />Since the beginning of history, mankind has pondered the origins of the universe. In ancient civilization, humans believed the earth was flat. Aristotle was perhaps one of the first people to postulate that the earth was not flat, but spherical. However, prior to Copernicus, it was believed that the earth was the center of the universe. Now we know that our sun is just one in millions of stars in a vast array of galaxies. It was Edwin Hubble that demonstrated that the universe was expanding. The idea that the universe is expanding means that there must have been a beginning, and a beginning of time. This was the first time that the origin of the universe had become a matter of science.<br />Newton's theory of gravity was always assumed to be accurate, until Einstein came along with the general theory of relativity. Einstein came up with the theory that no mass can travel faster than the speed of light. In his formula, E=mc², the more energy an object has, the more mass it has, and thus the more resistance. The only constant that can be really sure is speed, or rate, while time and distance can be relative. Time, is another dimension of our universe. Because of the distance of the stars and galaxies away from us, we are seeing what happened in the past.<br />Prior to the uncertainty principle, scientists held a very deterministic view of the universe that reflected the modernistic Enlightenment era. The uncertainty principle shows that you cannot predict the future state of a particle. This showed that there is a limit to which science can predict future events based on the laws of physics. As a result of the uncertainty principle, quantum mechanics was formulated to deal with the limitations arising from the uncertainty principle. Rather than trying to define the exact locations of particles, they had a quantum state which factored position and velocity.<br />Democritus, the Greek philosopher who coined the term atom, was perhaps the first philosopher who thought that there was an indivisible element of matter. It was not until the past century that it was discovered that an atom itself had an internal structure. According to quantum mechanics, an atom's particles move in waves because of the nature of its wave/particle duality. The exclusion principle says that a particle cannot exist in the same state or location at the same time. The exclusion principle explains why matter does not collapse into a very high density.<br />Hawkings describes how force-carrying particles can be grouped into four categories based on varying strength: gravitational force, electromagnetic force, weak nuclear force, and a strong nuclear force. There have been attempts to combine these forces into a grand unified theory. However, grand unified theories do not include the force of gravity, which has been the subject of general relativity. A future quantum theory of gravity would hopefully unite quantum mechanics with general relativity.<br />The affect of gravity on light was not clarified until after the theory of general relativity.  It was hypothesized that a star could have such a large gravitational force that light could not escape-that would be a black hole. Black holes are difficult to detect. There currently is evidence for a number of black holes, and even some hints that there are black holes at the center of galaxies.<br />At the big bang, the universe was infinitely small. Hawking notes something interesting in that if the rate of expansion was any slower, then the universe would have recollapsed under its own gravitational forces. Hawking suggests that it is possible that God might have picked the initial configuration of the universe, but that the weak anthropic principle states that we see the universe the way it is because if it was not that way, then we would not be here to see it. The strong anthropic principle says that there may be many different universes (multiverse) or many different regions in the universe so that the odds are that intelligent life may form somewhere. I believe that the universe appears to be so finely tuned for life because it was created that way, not because we happened to have lucky odds. The strong anthropic principle was developed as a way to avoid the idea of an intelligent designer. If there was a Creator, then we can believe that the universe was created this way on purpose. The \\"inflationary\\" model of the beginning of the universe has been formulated in order to show that many different initial configurations of the universe could have been possible so that life could be sustained. This means that the universe once expanded at an increasing rate, faster than today.<br />Nevertheless, even if we discover all of the laws of the universe, we still would not know why the universe was here to begin with. As Hawking asks, \\"Why does the universe go to all the bother of existing?\\"at God might have picked the initial configuration of the universe, but that the weak anthropic principle states that we see the universe the way it is because if it was not that way, then we would not be here to see it.

This is perhaps one of the most influential books produced in the 20th century.<br />Written by somebody who witnessed the destruction of the Jews in the Holocaust, this book forced confrontation with the issue that many people preferred not to talk about. You might think you knew enough about the Holocaust, but if you haven't read this book (or personally witnessed it first-hand), then you don't know much.<br />This should be a book that is required for EVERYone in society to read. Let us never forget the lessons that can be learned from this dark period in history.<br />One of the first startling tragedies exposed in this book is that despite one man's dire warnings, a town completely ignored all the signs and waited for the looming destruction. They had enough time to escape with all the advanced warnings, but they chose to ignore it. Can this be a lesson for us to learn as well?<br />The book also shows how a young man who was devout in his religion struggles with how a good God could possibly allow the large-scale massacre of innocent human life. How could he praise a God that allows this kind of suffering? He asks, &quot;Why should I bless him? ...Because He had had thousands of children burned in His pits?&quot; Yet, when he doubts the existence of God, he suddenly feels alone in a cold, unloving world.<br />The author also describes how a once devout Rabbi loses his faith in God. The Rabbi tells him, &quot;It's the end. God is no longer with us... Where is the divine Mercy? Where is God? How can I believe, how could anyone believe, in this merciful God?&quot;<br />Yet the spiritual breakthrough comes when Elie watches Rabbi Eliahou looking for his son who gave up on him. The Rabbi could not keep up in a long march, and his son, kept on pressing forward farther ahead of him, leaving his father behind. Elie realizes that the son had &quot;sought this separation in order to get rid of the burden, to free himself from an encumbrance which could lessen his own chances of survival.&quot; Yet, Elie is &quot;glad that Rabbi Eliahou should continue to look for his beloved son.&quot; And he prays that he will never be like the son. He saw God as continuing to look for him, even when Elie had given Him up for dead.ances of survival.&quot; Yet, Elie is &quot;glad that Rabbi Eliahou should continue to look for his beloved son.&quot; And he prays that he will never be like the son.

US	43874457	RJ3YWZAFZ3P6W	0915144867	656404453	Second Treatise of Government (Hackett Classics)	Books	5	89	95	N	N	John Locke's classic in handy format +plus bonus essay	In his book, Second Treatise of Government, John Locke (1632 - 1704) writes that all humans are born equal with the same ability to reason for themselves, and because of this, government should have limitations to ensure that people are free from the arbitrary will of another person, according to the laws of nature. Government, in Locke's view, is a social contract between the people in control, and the people who submit to it.<br />The editor of this edition, C. B. Macpherson, gives a little background and overview in his introduction to this book. He writes that the book \\"was directed against the principles of Sir Robert Filmer, whose books, asserting the divine authority of kings and denying any right of resistance, were thought by Locke and his fellow Whigs to be too influential among the gentry to be left unchallenged by those who held that resistance to an arbitrary monarch might be justified.\\" (p. viii)<br />Locke's book served as a philosophical justification for revolting against tyrannical monarchies in the Glorious Revolution and the American Revolution. His book was practically quoted in the Declaration of Independence.<br />Locke lays out his basis for government on the foundation that people are able to reason. Because of this, people have inherent freedoms or natural rights. Though he believed in reason, Locke was an empiricist, meaning he believed that all knowledge of the world comes from what our senses tell us. The mind starts as a &quot;tabula rasa&quot;, latin for an empty slate. As soon as we are born, we immediately begin learning ideas. Thus, all the material for our knowledge of the world comes to us through sensations. Nevertheless, Locke had an unshakable faith in human reason. He believed that people do learn what is right and wrong, regardless of what they choose to do. Locke believed that faith in God, certain moral norms and understanding consequences were inherent in human reason. So, even though people acquire everything they know about the world through the senses, they are able to think for themselves and reason at a higher level about what they learn.<br />Locke presumed that there are universally recognized principles and that the consequences are practically scientific. He was greatly influenced by Isaac Newton (1647-1727) who wrote The Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy. Locke took the ideas that there were \\"natural laws\\" in science and tried to extend that to society.<br />Natural laws, or rights, in Locke's view, are obvious and learned through human reasoning, and apply to everyone.  They are also called \\"self-evident,\\" which appears in The Declaration of Independence. All humans are created equal, and Locke bases this idea on the golden rule, that people are to do to others as they would have others do to them.  Natural equality is the basis of the first and most important \\"natural law\\" which is to care for one another. (p. 9) Locke believes that with or without government, there were universal natural rights.<br />Without government, people are unprotected from harm by other people. Where there is no government, people are free to do as they please, even to harm others. In this state, natural laws still apply, such as the right of people to protect themselves and seek reparation for injuries done to them. However, people are naturally inconsistent in executing punishments, because they have a propensity to act out of hate or revenge. Therefore, laws are necessary in a civil society to fairly arbitrate justice. The purpose of creating a civil society is to avoid major conflicts and keep peace.<br />Thus, civil government is a &quot;contract&quot; between people to regulate their affairs fairly. According to Locke's theories, people enter into a social contract by forming governments that will preserve order.<br />Locke describes a civil government as being democratic with some checks to ensure that it does not overstep its boundaries, and having both legislative and executive powers. A civil government is democratic or representative, meaning laws are created by the consent of the people through the voice of a majority vote. The legislature should represent the people equally based on population. (Salus populi suprema lex) All people are subject to the law, including the rulers-no one is above the law. Even the legislature needs \\"standing rules\\" to keep it from over-stepping its boundaries. Locke advocated the principle of division of powers. Because the legislature only meets at appointed times to create or revise laws, there needs to be an executive power that is constantly enforcing the laws.  So Locke describes a division of the legislative and executive powers.<br />In contrast to what was being claimed by the rulers of the time, Locke taught that the purpose of government is to serve and benefit the people and that it should be controlled by the people for which the government was made. His claim that people have the right to rebel against government was controversial.  Second Treatise of Government served as a foundation for future political philosophies.ive powers.

Two philosophies are subtly and indirectly compared in this book: individualism and collectivism.<br />&quot;Collectivism holds that the individual is not an end to himself, but is only a tool to serve the ends of the group.\\" [Mark da Cunha of Capitalism.org] This sums up the philosophy that the characters in Darkness at Noon believed. As a result of this philosophy, the collective group becomes the standard of ethics, instead of the individual.<br />Socialism and liberal democracy have at least one thing in common--Both sides believe government is needed to put a limit on individual decision-making power, and ensure the fair enforcement of laws. But one main difference is that the ideal result of socialism was that freedom from oppression, particularly from the bourgeoisie, would be achieved through economic equality. The theory sounds good, but Darkness at Noon presented it as a goal that eluded them and was impossible to attain.<br />Koestler plays the concepts of egoism and altruism against each other: whether an individual should be more concerned with self-preservation or self-sacrifice for the good of the community. In collectivism, the individual is only a means of achieving the end goals, so altruism is valued and promoted. Rubashov charges the Party of acting only to preserve itself, rather than for the best interest of the masses. It is as if the Party organization itself hypocritically practices egoism, while it calls for altruism from its members. But then Rubashov's interregator accuses him of doing exactly the same thing.<br /><br />The first major problem with communism or collectivism is that people cannot freely disagree. One example is recorded in Rubashov's diary entry:<br /> \\"A short time ago, our leading agriculturist, B., was shot with thirty of his collaborators because he maintained the opinion that nitrate artificial manure was superior to potash.\\" (p. 79) In this particular case, the truth was decided by the person in charge.<br />The next major problem that Koestler exposes is the question of who decides what is truth. Why should the person in charge decide truth just because he happens to have power? Why should he have the ability to decide what is right? In this system, it is the Party that decides what is true and false.<br />Individuals are denied free-will, or the power to make decisions for themselves. If they do make a decision, it has to be according to policy. If they make a bad decision, they will be punished. Rubashov makes a good point: \\"How can the present decide what will be judged truth in the future? We are doing the work of prophets without their gift.\\"<br />In collectivism, people cannot decide for themselves what is morally right and wrong. Ethics are controlled by the Party. What is good and bad is relative to what the Party allows. If people are not free to disagree and decide what is truth, how can the Party know how to truly represent the masses? Rubashov believed that the main reason why the communist system was failing was because it no longer represented the people.<br />It seemed like the Party wanted to create a nation of mindless robots, without any free-will to make choices. They would have to use force when necessary to subject the people to the whim of the Party. They wanted to erase the boundaries of the individual and merge people into the collective. They wanted to eliminate the pronoun \\"I\\" from their vocabulary as if it was \\"grammatical fiction.\\"<br />If the goal of the Bolshevik's communism was to achieve freedom from oppression through economic equality, then it failed. Collectivism is inherently oppressive. If a struggle to free people from suffering only results in more suffering, then it defeats its own purpose.defeats its own purpose.	2003-10-14

Rather than simply telling a few jokes to keep people entertained, Webb shows how laughter is an important way to share God's grace. Comedy is not merely a few jokes, but rather the combination of an event or story, plus irony and metaphor told through the preacher's imagination and his personality.<br />Webb is honest in saying that there are times when comedy is appropriate and times when it is not. Some topics are serious and should not be taken lightly. Laughter is okay only when it appreciates and takes the subject seriously. Laughter is not appropriate when it is at another person's expense, and sarcasm is not appropriate because it is hostile and based on hatred.  Nevertheless, laughter is a way to transcend the limits of human weakness. Laughter is a reflection of celebration and hope. Webb believes that not all laughter is good, and not all laughter should be condoned. But when people understand that, then they can find appropriate kinds of humor to use.<br />I didn't really agree with a lot of Webb's theological justification. It sounded a lot like salvation by works (either community or individually) and like it promoted a \\"social gospel\\" instead of personal life-changing.<br />Also, he has a Post-Modern view of the sermon, where the authority is not based in scripture, but rather the preacher and the event. I believe that a true Christian preacher should always be expounding on scripture, or we loose our Biblical authority (sola scriptura). We should try to make the Bible relevant to today by using various techniques, and not substituting the Bible with non-inspired sources. However, I don't think you have to agree with his theology to get the important mechanics from this book.<br />According to Webb, there are five dimensions of comedy: immanence, doubting, incongruity, ambiguity, and solidarity.<br />Some qualities of a \\"comic\\" sermon are:<br />1) It has purpose<br />2) It involves a range of emtions<br />3) It helps us deal with the world we live in<br />4) It is Biblical<br />5) It offers unfailing hope<br />6) It is playful<br />7) It is original and spoken through preacher's own experience.<br />The comic sermon is honest and frank, and yet it is probing and sometimes nosy. It helps us to realize our dependency on God and provides promises as hope.<br />The comic sermon has more impact if the humor is part of a narrative story. Within the framework of a story, incongruencies or \\"ironies\\" are used to make people think and face the inconsistencies of reality.<br />Five forms of incongruencies or \\"ironies\\":<br />1) The Anticipated and the Unanticipated<br />2) Ambition vs. Achievement<br />3) The Ideal and Actual<br />4) Individual vs. Institution<br />5) The Normal and the Abnormal<br />Webb also talks about hyperboles, metaphors, parables, and developing a comic persona. Webb says that we are the funniest when we act like ourselves and loosen up. He also stresses the importance of speaking extemporaneously and sounding spontaneous.<br />Though I didn't agree with a lot of his theology, this book is a great resource that I will be drawing from a lot in the future.re:<br />1) It has purpose<br />2) It involves a range of emtions<br />3) It helps us deal with the world we live in<br />4) It is Biblical<br />5) It offers unfailing hope<br />6) It is playful<br />7) It is original and spoken through preacher's own experience.<br />The comic sermon is honest and frank, and yet it is probing and sometimes nosy.

Watson helped discover the 3D structure of the double helix, and led out as a director of the Human Genome Project. There are three main aspects to this book: 1) the recent and on-going history of scientific discoveries in the exploration of genetics, 2) the mechanics of how things work (such as how DNA replicates or is cloned, or how genes are linked to diseases, etc.) and 3) the author's perspective of how life evolved.<br />Prior to the discovery of DNA, people have been playing around with heredity and the role of inheriting traits in breading animals and agriculture since the beginning of history. But with the developments of science, the study of genetics has brought more light to the subject. Watson talks about the people who contributed to the emerging field of genetics, from Gregor Mendel and Charles Darwin, through the \\"eugenics\\" movement of the early 1900's, to the Human Genome Project. By telling the stories of the struggles in science, with the author's frankness, honesty and wit, Watson gains authority and authenticity in the presentation of his information. This book is illuminating and will arouse an interest in the subject of genetics in every reader.<br />My only personal problem with the book is that the author presents his opinions and perspectives within the text as if his opinions themselves were facts, while in truth there are many issues that are still debated. Watson starts with the founding assumption, or presupposition that life is the result of chance. He makes some unfounded assertions or conclusions that might have other alternate viewpoints. For example, he goes from talking about the chemical properties and processes of DNA replication, jumping to how life began in an \\"RNA world.\\" He also implies that Arthur Kornberg had created \\"life in a test tube,\\" while Kornberg himself has written that he did not, in fact, create life. (Journal of Bacteriology)<br />Watson also asserts that, \\"The Human Genome Project has proved Darwin more right than Darwin himself would ever have dared dream.\\" But on what basis can he say this? The HGP merely sequenced and mapped DNA and cannot prove anything by itself. Watson employs circular thinking to support evolutionary claims: \\"proofs\\" that are founded on the presupposition that humans are results of evolution. The primary argument for evolution is the similarity between all biological systems. But, what if all biological systems were designed similarly on purpose? If something works well in one place, why redesign it? Watson believes that the \\"grandest mission\\" of molecular biology is to answer questions about ourselves and our origins as a species. But, as long as scientists start with the presupposition that humans are the result of evolution, the results will always be interpreted that way. So my only caution is that you should distinguish what is actually fact and what is merely the author's speculation.<br />Anyway, I recommend this book to anyone who is interested in the subject of genetics. Watson presents almost every aspect of the subject in clear detail, and he is frank about the ethical and social implications of the discoveries that are sure to challenge traditional ways of thinking.written that he did not, in fact, create life.

This book shows that Ellen White (1827-1915) was way ahead of her times in the area of psychology. Even before psychology had become acceptable science, she had experience with the basic fundamentals of psychology and sociology. This book should be required reading for all Christians who work with people, whether you are a parent, teacher, pastor, counselor, social worker or whatever.<br />Ellen White had amazing insights in the area of personality traits and personality development, the issue of nature and nurture in character formation, mental health, and behavioral modification. While I'm sure she might have reflected some of the current thinking of her times, she still was ahead of her time considering the fact that a lot of the issues she dealt very well with were confirmed by the sciences a century later.<br />Volume 1 (which is what I've read so far) deals with the study of the mind, how religion helps the mind, emotions, prenatal influence on character formation, parental influence, nature vs. nurture, love, infatuation, sexuality, self-respect, dependence and independence (an important topic), guilt, doubt, marriage, principles of motivation, and principles of education, study and learning.<br />UPDATE: I previously had doubts about the idea of \\"prenatal influence on character formation.\\" This was written at the turn of the century, and it certainly did not sound very scientific. BUT, I just attended a panel discussion at Notre Dame between biologists and ethicists, and a study was described that proves that there apparently is a prenatal influence on character formation.

We are often taught that having desires are bad, and that we should suppress them. However, God created humans to desire. Desire is what motivates us and drives our behavior. Desires are also the greatest source of suffering. It is okay to have &quot;needs&quot; or inner desires, but it is how we choose to satisfy those desires that make it right or wrong. Our suffering is usually the result of our deepest inner desires being hurt, wounded or neglected. We will do whatever it takes to ease the pain of suffering, by trying to escape it, minimize it, or dull it somehow, either by indulging in some form of pleasure or by shutting down our hearts. This is how we fall into the traps of addictions.<br />God comes along and thwarts our attempts to satisfy our desires or our attempts to build our own paradise. He thwarts us in order to save us. Our problem is that we don't know what it is exactly that we really want. John Eldredge shows us how God is the Desire of Ages--He is everything we ever needed. God wants an intimate relationship with us. He wants to satisfy our desires.<br />God promises to restore our hearts. Even though God subjected the world to futility, He seeks to restore us and fulfill us with meaning and purpose by giving us eternal life. That eternal life is through the death and resurrection of Jesus. God promises to restore us spiritually as well as eternally.<br />This book is really deep. I underlined a lot of his content. It has helped me on my Christian walk to have a deeper relationship with God.	2003-08-01

While I did enjoy many points that C.S. Lewis makes, and I understand that he is a highly respected author, but I have to disagree with some of the reviewers. I feel that Mere Christianity is becoming out-dated.<br />Since many people may already know what the book is about, I want to focus on some areas where I feel that C. S. Lewis is becoming out-dated. I feel that Mere Christianity may have been a revolutionary book for its time and helped spark some discussion about Christianity. But as apologists have to update their arguments when new responses have been made, this book has to keep up with new developments in the discussion about Christianity.<br />C. S. Lewis' argument against Duality seems to fail. He writes, \\"Then good would not deserve to be called good.\\" (p. 43) Lewis tries to see the eastern philosophy through a western standpoint. But people who hold the eastern viewpoint do not see any dividing line between good and evil. They would state that reality is completely \\"beyond\\" good and evil, and thus there only appears to be a distinction to our culturally conditioned minds, but in actuality, there is no distinction between good and evil, and therefore one cannot even use the words \\"good\\" and \\"evil.\\"<br />I disagree with Lewis on the idea that everybody lives forever, on a theological basis. Even though he never uses the Bible to support his claims, he writes, \\"Again, Christianity asserts that every individual human being is going to live for ever, and this must be either true or false.\\" (p. 74) The Bible states that God \\"alone has immortality.\\" (1 Timothy 6:16) and that the wicked will be completely wiped out of existence in the last days.<br />Also, C. S. Lewis' watered-down approach to charity, \\"If our expenditure on comforts, luxuries, amusements, etc., is up to the standard common among those with the same income as our own, we are probably giving away too little,\\" (p. 86) would be an understatement for the wealthy.<br />I also disagree with Lewis' definition of temperance. He writes, \\"Temperance referred not specially to drink, but to all pleasures; and it meant not abstaining, but going the right length and no further.\\" (p. 78) Temperance actually does mean abstaining from anything that is bad-alcohol, drugs, and smoking are all bad. It also means moderation in anything that is good-Yes, you can get too much of a good thing-but the Bible does not tell us to be \\"moderate\\" in our destructive behavior. The Bible calls us to abstain, to separate from evil, and to be pure. Where is Lewis' scriptural support? None, because he does not have scriptural support.<br />But then again, maybe this is because C. S. Lewis likes drinking alcohol. He admits, \\"At least I know I should be very angry if the Mohammedans tried to prevent the rest of us from drinking wine.\\" (p. 112) Lewis also states that Christians \\"may see fit to give up all sorts of things for special reasons-marriage, or meat, or beer, or the cinema; but the moment he starts saying the things are bad in themselves, or looking down his nose at other people who do use them, he has then the wrong turning.\\" (p. 79) I disagree because beer and marriage are not on the same level. Alcohol really is bad. It is not the same as eating meat. Discouraging others from refraining from alcohol does not necessarily mean looking down one's nose at others.<br />I personally feel that C. S. Lewis puts too much emphasis on social morality, and I will explain. On page 84, Lewis writes about Christian literature, Christian novelists, Christian dramatists, Christian society, Christian economists, Christian this, and Christian that. Next thing you know, we might be deciding between Christian toothpaste and non-Christian toothpaste when we shop at the grocery store. Is the point of Christianity to make society Christian or to make Christian products?

I also use paraphrase Bibles so that I can get a quick overall understanding of the passages that I'm studying...<br /><br />I have compared the New Living Translation, the Message Bible, and the Clear Word. These represent different levels of paraphrasing the Bible.<br /><br />The New Living Translation is the most accurate of the paraphrases. The NLT is a \\"thought-for-thought\\" translation.<br /><br />The Message Bible is a more looser paraphrase in very upbeat contemporary language and is an inspiring devotional because it puts messages in a new light. But I found that it is actually the worst when it comes to reinterpreting passages and putting the translator's own preconceived understandings into the passage.<br /><br />That's why I enjoy the Clear Word. Yes, Jack Blanco elaborates on some passages to explain what he thinks they mean--and that is why this is a \\"Devotional\\" Bible (its not meant for serious Bible study)--but I find that Blanco is far more faithful to what the text originally meant than the Message Bible.<br /><br />The Clear Word deserves five stars for *faithfully* communicating what the Bible is trying to say in modern, contemporary language and for its excellent readability. It has pretty much the same goal as the Message Bible, but I think the Clear Word is more faithful.<br /><br />However, for studying the Bible and preaching, never use a paraphrase Bible. I continue to recommend the following as the most accurate contemporary translations:<br /><br />* New American Standard Bible (NASB) is perhaps TOO accurate sometimes, though it can be inconsistent;<br /><br />* New Revised Standard Version (NRSV) is also accurate and I like its language choice better than NASB;<br /><br />* New International Version (NIV) continues to be very good;<br /><br />* New King James Version (NKJV) is a classic, but its word choice can be poor sometimes<br /><br />Of course, the best way to read the Bible is in the Greek and Hebrew! :)<br /> <br />Of course, the best way to read the Bible is in the Greek and Hebrew! :)	2003-03-20

But the special gift or talent of a good writer, teacher, or preacher is the ability to bring the message home and show why it is important and relevant to the audience.<br />John Ortberg not only entertains and captivates the audience's attention, but he motivates the reader to experience a deeper level of faith.<br />If anything should convince you how GOOD this book is, it might be the many sermons I've heard already given by different preachers who borrowed material right out of this book! It's obviously good inspiration.  But everybody should just go straight to the source and read it for themselves.<br />This book came at the right time in my spiritual struggles, and I'm sure it will help a lot of people learn to walk closer with God, learning to trust and depend on Him.<br />At first glance, the book might not seem &quot;deep&quot; but his message is detailed and profound.  It is straightforward, but his call for Christians to wake up and step out in faith is powerful.<br />This book is a MUST READ for anybody who calls him/herself a Christian.  It deserves 5 stars.	2002-03-20

I have some familiarity with Joseph Campbell's books, and have studied the Hero's Journey and watched the Power of Myth series.<br /><br />I was pleasantly surprised to see Campbell's distinction between eastern and western mythological views more developed, as he explained the differences in how symbols are interpreted and applied in eastern and western cultures, though he still does not touch the differences in the *relationship* of good and evil in Western vs. Eastern mythologies.<br /><br />Campbell is a master of myths, and has put a lot of time and research into his ideas, and for this he deserves a lot of respect. Because of his knowledge of various source material, students who are unfamiliar with the Bible may not detect problems with his interpretations. But fallacies arise because he narrowly views the Christian tradition thru the lens of Catholicism, which I believe misrepresents the Bible.<br /><br />For example, Campbell accuses Christianity of teaching that a relationship with God comes thru the \\"Institution.\\" Again, that may be what is taught in Catholicism, but not according to many other denominations.<br /><br />In Thou Art That, Campbell frequently accuses the \\"Church\\" of over-emphasizing rituals and symbols, and interpreting the Bible very literally. But, Christians will dismiss that by pointing out that there are many churches out there who delve into the deeply spiritual meanings of the Bible. And many Protestant churches already reject the ritualism and pagan traditions that the Roman church had introduced.<br /><br />Campbell uses questionable doctrines that are unique to the Roman Catholic tradition to show how they come from eastern mythologies, but these teachings themselves are not to be found anywhere in the Bible! For example, the teaching that the Virgin Mary ascended to heaven, among other things, is not found in the Bible. You cannot use non-Biblical sources to prove that the Bible says something that it doesn't. (Whew) But, he constantly pulls from non-Biblical sources to say that they are a part of the Judeo-Christian tradition.<br /><br />Campbell frequently quotes from the Gospel of Thomas as if it is a part of the Christian \\"mythological view\\" even though most Christian churches reject it as being false and uninspired.<br /><br />Campbell makes some good points in looking at the spiritual meaning of religious texts. But, principles of hermeneutics tells us that the \\"spiritual interpretation\\" of something should at least be compatible with the literal interpretation and not say opposite things, otherwise the \\"spiritual\\" interpretation may be a misunderstanding. Campbell's spiritual interpretation of Genesis conflicts with the moral of the literal story. Campbell says that God wanted Adam and Eve to sin, but if you read the Bible literally, God did *not* want Adam and Eve to sin. Campbell says that as a result of the Fall, Adam and Eve became more in tune with God/nature, but according to the literal story of the Fall, they fell out of harmony with God and nature. Thus, his spiritual interpretation says the *exact opposite* of the literal interpretation.<br /><br />Campbell is right in that one tree in the Garden of Eden represents Unity while the other tree represents Duality. Then Campbell theorizes that they are the same tree. But, this contradicts the point of the two trees to begin with. They both represent two different worldviews: the Tree of Life represents the worldview of harmony thru Good (no Evil), while the Tree of Knowledge represents the worldview of harmony thru mingling Good and Evil. It is not Good versus Evil, but rather Good versus Good AND Evil-- that is Unity versus Duality. This would be consistent with lessons from the literal story. But Campbell thinks that in the \\"spiritual\\"context, they are really the same tree, essentially interpreting both of them only as Duality, and thus contradicting the meaning derived from the literal interpretation of the story.<br /><br />In general, Campbell tries to say that an underlying theme in mythology is that harmony is obtained thru going beyond opposites. On the other hand, anybody who reads the Bible in a straight-forward way will see the theme is consistently that harmony is obtained not thru \\"going beyond\\" good and evil, but rather thru the *separation* of good and evil--this is the underlying theme in the Judeo-Christian tradition and it stands in stark contrast to the worldview that Campbell attempts to interpret out of the Bible.ng both of them only as Duality, and thus contradicting the meaning derived from the literal interpretation of the story.

However, I changed my rating because I had a major problem with the author's view of \\"natural vs positive\\" law.  The author includes a quote by Thomas Jefferson, who I regard as my \\"policital\\" hero.  \\"God, who gave us life, gave us liberty.  Can the liberties of a nation remain secure when we have removed a conviction that these liberties are the gift of God?\\"<br /><br />I'm responding as a fellow Christian. The author acknowledges that our constitution protects our \\"God-given\\" rights, but does not mention that our Founding Fathers were mostly Deists who purposefully did not mention the word \\"God\\" in the U.S. Constitution. Was this a mistake or on purpose? When the U.S. was founded, western society was going through the Enlightenment era when Deism (the idea that the universe was created, but God is no longer involved) was prevalant. Nevertheless, the author reinterprets \\"natural law\\" as the Ten Commandments, in contrast to how people such as John Locke might have viewed it. The author also assumes that all Christians agree that the government should rule on the basis of the \\"Ten Commandments.\\" Many of our Enlightenment-era Deist founders, such as Thomas Jefferson, believed that government is merely a social contract that maintains justice, security, and welfare between the people.  With religious persecutions in recent memory, our founders recognized the need to govern from non-religious interests--this is the reason why our first ammendment prevents the establishment of a government-sponsored church and allows for the free market of religious ideas. I believe God has blessed western countries like the U.S. because of the freedoms established. Many Christians today forget the importance of democracy in protecting the freedom of conscience. As long as we live in this sinful world without God's visible presence, we don't need some zealous people trying to establish a theocracy--we should cherish the democracy we live in with its \\"natural\\" freedoms.  Even if God was visible to us, He would have given us the freedom to choose to follow Him--without that freedom, there would be no real love.<br /><br />It's not the role of government to dictate to the conscience what is morally right and wrong, unless it has an interest in protecting national health, security or welfare. Christians acknowledge as first and foremost their accountability to God. They seek balance between the exercise of individual liberty and their accountability to the faith community and the larger society and its laws. Christians make their choices according to scripture and the laws of God rather than the norms of society.  Any attempts to coerce people through laws to follow established \\"moral principles\\" should be rejected as infringements of personal freedom.<br />That's my only (big) problem with this book, otherwise I would have given it five stars.the democracy we live in with its \\"natural\\" freedoms.

This is a book that ALL men, Christian or non-Christian, should read.<br /><br />Ironically, my mother gave me this book, so I thought it was going to be another self-help book and I shoved it aside. My brother used the book as his mousepad, so I eventually picked it up out of curiousity and just could NOT put it down.<br /><br />WOW!! This guy cuts thru the thick of everything. When the author quoted mothers as often saying, \\"Don't grow up to be like your father,\\" this guy knew exactly what he was talking about. From his experience as a counselor, he's obviously seen enough.<br /><br />To be honest, not many books keep my attention long enough to read completely through, but this book is fun to read. His humorous stories will make you double-over with laughter, but sometimes will make your eyes teary. But, overall, it's is a must-read for every man out there.<br /><br />You might think the guy is stereotyping. But, the fact is, many guys do face insecurities deep, deep down in their psyche. Maybe I wouldn't consider the author an expert on female psychology, but he certainly can talk straightforward man-to-man.<br /><br />A friend of mine told me that churches spend a lot of money on women's ministries, but that the people they *really* need to be ministering to in these times are men! Many men stay away from churches because Christianity has been \\"softened\\" and they think that church is for women.<br />So I like how Eldredge casts characters of the Bible in the \\"warrior\\" light so that you can see how men can fit naturally into God's ultimate design.<br /><br />EXCELLENT BOOK!!!!!	2002-01-18

I have to admit that this book is not universally accepted in the scientific arena, and there are obvious reasons for that--Humphreys attempts to prove that cosmological data can fit the Biblical interpretation of a young universe made only 6,000 years ago. However, it has to be admitted that Humphreys presents some things to at least seriously consider.<br /><br />The goal of the book is the help resolve the apparent contradiction of starlight and a young universe. If light can only travel at a set speed, then how can we see stars made only 6,000 years ago when it should take a lot longer for us to see them?<br /><br />Humphreys proposed that the theory of general relativity can allow for time dilation to slow down earth time in relation to the rest of creation, so that while the earth might have been created in six literal earth days, the universe was expanding for thousands of years. Time dilation is supported by Einstein's theory of general relativity. According to the theory of relativity, time slows down as objects approach the speed of light.<br /><br />Regardless of whether or not the speed of light can change, as proposed by Barry Setterfield, Russell Humphrey's main objection to the Big Bang theory is that it is based on certain presuppositions, like whether the universe is bounded, which is fair to say.<br /><br />Other scientists argue that the Big Bang cosmology predicts that clock rates change only about 10% to the furthest galaxies. However, the young-universe models do not follow the standard Big Bang(black hole) predictions to begin with. The question may not be \\"How much has the speed of light changed?\\" but \\"How fast has time changed?\\" Also, at the point of singularity, it is impossible to say whether or not the same laws of physics would apply.<br /><br />The book has been under a lot of discussion, and suggests an interesting idea, though time will tell if the theory can hold. It should be noted that the author has worked for Sandia National Laboratories in nuclear physics, geophysics, pulsed power research, theoretical atomic and nuclear physics, and the Particle Beam Fusion Project. My cosmology professor's complaint was that if the speed of light changed and time slowed down, then that might present problems with atomic structure, but it seems as though this author should know a lot about that from working in atomic and nuclear physics, considering the author's credentials.<br /><br />I can think of a few Bible verses that could support his application of General Relativity to creation. My only complaint was that I prefer not to interpret Genesis as saying that the earth is at the center of the universe, as Humphrey's idea suggests--though he does admit that his interpretation of how Creation might have unfolded is purely speculation.<br /><br />Anyway, his ideas on GR certainly leaves room for other possibilities.
