It's a tale of redemption, romance, intrigue, murder, evil conspiracies, suspense, thrills, chills, adventure, ghosts, gods...it goes on and on.  <br />Moore's imagination runs wild, and this tale will suck you in and keep you glued from the first page til the last...I even had to read the acknowledgements, I just didn't want this book to end.<br />And if that's not enough, it's incredibly well written, with a plot that keeps you wondering what's coming next and how it all will work out.   Let me tell you...it works out great...amazing in fact.<br />I can't recommend this escape from reality highly enough...enjoy!	2000-12-16

The radically odd group of characters are compelling, fascinating, and amazingly real and human.  The underbelly of Hollywood--where the struggle is acute, the humiliations constant, and the fame and glitz a nearly-tangible mirage--is perfectly rendered.  The story is wonderful, careening from hilarity to tragedy in abruptly jarring transitions yet managing with each event to draw you deeper into the heroine's world.<br />And the heroine!  Cadence Roth is THE most inspiring, aggravating, disturbing, and fascinating character ever written about.  This is her story, as told through her journal entries--yet the novel isn't written with the jarring style that usually accompanies 'diary-narrative,' instead the dialog and descriptives are perfectly seamless, and the first person delivery is comforting through even the most trying times.<br />The most fascinating thing about this novel is that it is clearly inspired by real events, real people, and a real life--and most of it is pretty easily identifiable.  This just added to my enjoyment of this book--and I have some research to do to figure out the parts I couldn't identify.<br />I can't recommend this book highly enough--it's simply wonderful on every level.  This book is a huge departure, in many ways, from Maupin's other books (which are also wonderful), but Maupin's ability to create rich, complex characters and bring a subculture to life are in full evidence here.	2000-11-15

This is the second Julie Garwood novel I've read now, the first was 'The Secret' which overlaps with 'The Ransom.'  I was, I think now, unduly impressed with 'The Secret'--I thought it was remarkable for busting out of the romance genre's strictly adhered to rules and formulas.  What I've found, now that I've read a second Julie Garwood novel, is that, while she eschews the genre's standard tripe, she's created a set of rules and formulas of her own.  I suppose I'm naive to be surprised and disappointed by this, but I am.  <br />Now, to be fair, I enjoyed 'The Ransom.'  The story is actually more fraught and intriguing than 'The Secret.'  The novel begins with a series of tragedies in a toddler's young life--her mother dies, her home is invaded by brutal warriors, she's separated from her older sister, and she witnesses her father's murder at the hands of one of the invaders.  Thus begins the adventure that sets the heroine on the path that will eventually lead her into the arms of her strong, heroic, handsome highlander.  Our heroine proves to be strong-willed and brave, and, of course, gorgeous and sweet.<br />I enjoyed the adventures as well as the romance, but was disappointed with the limited role that the characers from 'The Secret' played, and the overly quick progression of the romantic track.  I found this novel less charming than 'The Secret,' but that may mostly be due to the transparancy of Garwood's formula now shining through and detracting from the novel's impact.	2000-11-12
US	52645574	RM7ZU1BV617PC	0671744216	986944205	The Secret	Books	4	12	12	N	Y	Helping me overcome my romance novel prejudices...	I had a hard time putting this one down.  I praise it above most romance novels for the simple reason that it doesn't follow any of the 'rules' or 'formulas' that are so obvious in most of the genre.<br />First, there's more than one plot weaving through this novel, and each is interesting, well-developed, and important to the story. Second, each of the many characters is well-developed, fascinating, and human--with motives, emotions, and drives that resonate and draw you into the story.<br />I hate when romance novelists force a contrived reason to keep the lovers apart, or when they insist on writing heavy-handed, hot and heavy love scenes--words like 'manrod,' 'creamy white thighs,' and 'luscious breasts' are nowhere to be found, thankfully.  Those types of romance novels insult my intelligence, and leave me amused but completely uninterested.<br />This is the story of a strong woman, taking a great risk for a friend and hoping to find some answers for herself by leaving England to go to the Scottish Highlands.  She is escorted by a strong, handsome laird.  And the scene is set for romance...but the romance is almost incidental--which is what I praise so highly, because the subplots are so much more interesting than a simple boy-meets-girl saga could ever be.  There is intrigue, conflict, fears and angers, politics, and play, and any number of twists and turns that kept me reading long into the night.<br />Basically, it's just good fiction--well-written, great story, great setting, and it just happens to include a gripping love story as well.  I am thrilled to have discovered Julie Garwood, for this novel and the promise of her others as well.  I'm already half way through another Garwood novel, 'The Ransom,' that features another Highlands Laird, a character from 'The Secret,' and am thrilled that there are a number of novels featuring members of the clans that are introduced in 'The Secret.'	2000-11-07

The Forbidden Tower tells the tale of the initial bonding of the foursome who broke new ground by defying the planet's laws and the will of the Comyn--the powerful race of psi-gifted people who are run the planet.  <br />The deepening relationships between members of the foursome, contrasted with the growing conflicts between them and those who oppose the 'Forbidden Tower' they've built in the overworld, lead to a rich and gripping story.  <br />The subplot of Callista's struggle to break the rigid taboos imposed upon her as a 'Keeper' so that she can be a true wife to Andrew and follow her own desires, is dramatic and fascinating.<br />This is a novel with many complex themes interwoven into a rich, fascinating story.  I enjoyed each element of the many plots, and thoroughly enjoyed it.	2000-11-05

This is the third installment in Merlin's early adventures--he's fourteen years old in this one, and his wizarding skills are sorely challenged and threatened in this adventure.  The long sleeping dragon has been awakened and threatens Fincayra, and a magic-anihilating cult has reappeared--their goal to wipe out magic wherever it appears on the island.  The stage is set for another epic struggle of good versus evil, and it's frequently tough to distinguish which is which.  <br />This is a fun fantasy read that speeds by too quickly.	2000-10-22

This is the tale of the early years of Merlin, the great wizard of Arthurian legend.  We first encounter him before he's discovered any of the magic within himself, and follow him through its first awakening and development.  Merlin is a likeable character, and we can see hints of the greatness to come.  Other characters we encounter are equally interesting and well-developed, as are his adventures, battles, and magical episodes. <br />Barron does a great job of maintaining consistency between the Merlin of the Arthurian legends and the early escapades of an immature, untried, and untutored wee-wizard.<br />This is a fun read for both kids, and adult fantasy lovers.  The story is engaging, the characters endearing, and the promise of future installments makes it an even better read.  The rest of the series is just as good!	2000-10-22

This is the first text book I used when I learned latin back in fifth grade (many a year ago!), and I still value the approach it took in awakening my interest and understanding of not just the language, but the culture, the history, the politics, the context of the Roman people and their language.  The text is filled with short 'stories' written in latin that encourage students to interact with the language in a living context, rather than treating the language as a dead, unusable language, as most latin texts do.  This text engaged my imagination, fascinated me, and inspired me as an an adult to visit Italy to see the ruins, the town of Pompeii, and other sites that I first learned about through its pages.  I thank this text for allowing me to translate latin I encountered in European Cathedrals I visited, as well.  <br />There are few texts from my grammar school years that I can recall, let alone praise (hint, I'm nearing 30...), but Ecce Romani is one that still cherish for the impact it had on me as a student, and the lasting effects I've been able to trace in my life.	2000-10-15

It stays true to Austen's original work, and builds on it both believably and realistically.<br />The Diary begins when Darcy is only ten years old, before Georgianna has even been born, and traces events even further than Austen herself did--into the married lives of Elizabeth and Darcy.<br />The Diary does a great job of revealing the story from Darcy's perspective--adding a richness and depth to my love of the P&amp;P tale.  <br />I so loved this book that I read it straight through in one sitting--just couldn't put it down!  That's probably my highest recommendation!	2000-10-15

This is the third in the mini-series focusing on the Renunciates, within the larger Darkover series.  It features the characters that have developed within the previous two novels, Jaelle, Magda, Camilla, and the Terran Cholayna.  This novel is much more action packed than the previous two had been, with a fraught and perilous journey across mountains, facing dangers both natural and supernatural, in search of a mythic city mentioned in obscure legends--the city of sorcery.  <br />This novel takes place seven years after 'Thendara House', and Jaelle and Magda are full-members now of the Forbidden Tower.  They've both been fully trained in the use of their Laran, and their abilities have grown considerably.  <br />If you've enjoyed the other two books in this series-within-a-series, 'Shattered Chain' and 'Thendara House,' you will love this one--it's definitely the best, and it truly delivers on the potential of the other two. If you've missed the first two, you'll still enjoy this one on its own--Bradley makes sure to provide recaps of relevant past events and relationships, allowing a new reader to dive straight into this story.  But, there's no question, if you already know and love these characters from their previous adventures, you'll be even more deeply engaged in this great story.	2000-10-15

'Thendara House' follows 'Shattered Chains' in the Darkover series, and continues to focus on the Guild of Renunciates, particularly Magda and Jaelle, as they grow into stronger, more self-aware characters.  Both are experiencing growing Psi-powers, and their destinies seem intertwined as they navigate the Terran/Darkover political world, explore the conflicts and pressures of their Oaths, and struggle to figure out exactly who they are, what they stand for, and where they belong.<br />I really enjoyed 'Shattered Chains' and 'Thendara House' gripped me from the very first pages.  I read through this novel--longer than 'Chains'--over a weekend, during which I hardly put it down, and never left it behind!  I just started 'The City of Sorcery' the next in the Renunciates grouping, and am already totally into it--thank goodness it's friday!	2000-10-13

This is the first in a consistently fabulous series, in which Jane Austen is the main character, and a brilliant sleuth at that!<br />Barron, the author, does a superior job of catching both the ambience and the language of Austen's times and literature.  Social satire underlies the series, as does an inherent respect for Jane herself.  Occasional, and sparing enough not to become annoying, quotes or near-quotes from Austen's works creep into the dialog in a way that gives the Austen fan a happy twinge of wistful nostalgia, without disrupting the flow of the story.<br />And the story itself is well worth the time--it's a rich mystery, with well developed plot, characters, environment, and dialog.   The author goes out of her way, particularly in this first installment, to create a sense that this is truly a documentation of actual events--that Jane's letters, diaries, and other accounts have been woven together into a narrative to share with Austen fans an element of her life that was previously unknown.  This is accomplished in a number of ways, including clever techniques and footnotes that do in fact contain historically accurate information about Jane, her family, the political and social context of her times, etc.<br />I really enjoyed this book, as well as the rest of the series, and recommend it not only to Austen fans, but fans of well-written mysteries, as well.	2000-10-07

The Dark Descent is an anthology of short horror fiction, that spans the full range of the genre from the extremely overt to the quietly subtle.  The editor, David Hartwell, has not only ordered the selections in a way that highlights the influences and references inherent in the work, but introduces each story with a brief, but informative foreword.  <br />What's most amazing to me about this tome, is that, having been an avid reader of horror short fiction for many years, and having read many such collections of work, this one included so many masterpieces that I'd never encountered before.<br />I believe this to be one of the most, if not THE most, comprehensive collections available, and recommend it to any fan of short fiction, particularly those who appreciate gothic, horror, and psychological thriller genres.	2000-10-05

There is a creepy spookiness, an uneasy strangeness that pervades the story, but nothing dramatically terrifying or shocking.  In fact, even when the paranormal events start to become more and more overt, there is still a lazy disinterested nature to the narrative.<br />This is one of those books that makes for a good rainy day read, but it isn't the dramatic, gripping horror story the title suggests.	2000-10-05

It's a historic, aristocratic murder mystery...an old-fashioned who-dunnit placed in Egypt at the beginning of the century, when archaeological discoveries were in their prime.  <br />The main characters are a family of noted egyptologists well known not only for their famed discoveries (tombs, mummies, you know..) but for their spate of crime solving successes.  Each family member has an over-the-top persona, and the dialog is hilarious due to both the aristocratic flair and the high-drama egos.<br />The mystery is fairly simplistic, but it's really more about the style than the substance.  This novel is high-camp all the way, which makes for a fun, amusing read.  There is an entire series of mysteries with this family/setting, but, honestly, one was enough for me.  As goofy and fun as this one was, I certainly wasn't intrigued by the characters--as, clearly, the author intended me to be--I was, rather, amused and slightly annoyed with them.	2000-10-05

This is a really fun, really goofy collection of one-hundred-dollar words that only the most arrogant intellectual--fastuous mandarins, to you!-- would ever pull out.  <br />BUT, I bought this book in the hopes of having a useful reference, not as a party trick propellant--thus the one star rating.  If you are looking for a serious, thesaurus-like aid for professional purposes, look elsewhere.  If you'd like to make people feel small through your skookum vocabulary (how's that?!), then this is the book for you.  And, I will admit there is fun to be had with this book, just know that's as much use as it will give you.	2000-10-05

The benefit is that it's a quick read, and makes for fine rainy day reading when you're in the mood for something a bit creepy and otherworldly.	2000-10-04

This story of a troubled young girl, and the special ed teacher who manages to reach through to her, is amazing, inspiring, and so completely memorable.<br />I cried more than once while reading their tale, was horrified, and proud, and a jumble of other strong emotions--because, not only is the story an amazing one, but it is written so well, so engagingly, that you lose yourself in their lives and struggles, and feel a close connection to them when they succeed and fail.<br />I recommend this book highly, but warn you to have Kleenex handy when you read it!	2000-10-04

I have loved Zelazny's Amber series for many years now, and recently tried to find all of the novels again, only to learn that many are out of print.  But with the &quot;Great Book of Amber&quot; all of the Amber books are in one volume.<br />This volume includes the original Amber series, in which Prince Corwin is the central character relearning his place in the monarchy and dissecting the politics and palace intrigues.  The royal family draws its power from the Pattern in Amber, Amber being the original world from which all other universes are mere shadows and combinations.<br />The second Amber series is included as well, in which Corwin's son is the central character.  He is a prince of both Amber and Chaos, and is a master of both Amber's powers (the Pattern) and the magical/wizardly powers of Chaos.<br />I love the magic and the epic nature of the adventures, and each individual novel within the series is a wonderful read.  The volume as a whole builds a world and a saga that will stick with you for ages after you've read it. <br />If you like Tolkien's Lord of the Rings, you'll probably enjoy this volume as well.	2000-10-03

I just stumbled upon Bradley's Darkover series recently, and have really been enjoying them, so I figured I'd like a selection from her witch series, as well.  <br />'Witch Hill' is a quick and somewhat entertaining read about a young woman who has just experienced a horrific series of deaths in her immediate family that quickly wipes everyone she's close to out.  But, right before her father's death he starts to tell her about an aunt of his, her namesake Aunt Sara, and she soon learns she's inherited Aunt Sara's ancient house in rural Massachusetts.  Sara heads out to check out her inheritance, and decides to spend the summer.  Everyone in the town thinks she's Aunt Sara (who died seven years earlier at the ripe old age of 80), and a portrait shows the resemblance IS uncanny.  Ol' Aunt Sara was a powerful witch, and the town is ready for young Sara to take up her Aunt's reigns in the local witch temple.  Meanwhile, a sweet romance has sprung up between Sara and the young hunky doctor.<br />But all the intricate plot-work aside, this novel never really gets revved up.  The reader is put through the paces, but the story is pretty two-dimensional.  The characters have the MOST atrocious dialogue ever.  But, it's a fun, goofy, light, and FAST read, so I give it a neutral two-stars.	2000-10-03

I have enjoyed each of the three books in Paksenarrion's Deed, and each has been harder to put down.  I've also noticed that the power, magic, and contrast between good and evil grows more pronounced with each novel in the series.  'Oath of Gold' tells the tale of dramatic evil and powerful good, and Paks' role is exciting and impressive.  In the third and last installment of Paks' amazing adventure she manages, with a little help from her friends, to recover from her fear and pains, and reach the destiny that has been hinted at from the beginning.  <br />Paks' growth and newfound strength enable her to embark on a new set of daring adventures, and meet challenges and evils with a new sense of self.  Along the way many of the characters we've met in the past re-enter the story, and the growth and changes of these characters adds another dimension of familiarity.<br />I loved this book, and had a really hard time putting it down in the middle (contributing to many hours of missed sleep!), but at 500 action packed, detailed pages it was impossible--and ill advised--to rush through.  The first book in the series introduces Paks' story with a scroll of extolling her deed, whose song/story ends mid verse, suggesting that her story is ongoing.  I would love to see more adventures including Paks', and am looking forward to reading the prequel to this series.	2000-09-30

The second book of Paksenarrion's Deed is even better than the first.  Paks embarks on a solo adventure after leaving the Company to its distasteful task.  The magic and Tolkien-ness of the world is more apparant in this installment than in the first book, and we encounter many more elves, dwarves, gnomes, orcs, and other magical creatures.  Evil makes a much more overt appearance in this novel, as well.  <br />Paks continues to grow as a warrior, an adventurer, and an active agent for good.  She continues to explore the influence of Gird in her life, and encounters great battles, harrowing tortures, and huge learning experiences along the way.  She makes several fascinating new friends, and some frightening new enemies.<br />This book managed to keep me enthralled from beginning to end--the action starts almost from the first page and continues to the very last.  I had a really hard time putting it down, and raced to get the last in the trilogy.  This series is great!	2000-09-30

Free  Amazons--a guild of women who renounce men's domination over women, the  Comyn--the noble caste with psi powers, an intricate society with traces of  the supernatural and feudal systems in place.  <br />The novel starts with a  daring rescue of a kidnapped, enchained, and very pregnant Comyn Lady from  the barbaric Dry Towns chief who has kept her his prisoner/wife for over a  decade.

Yet, he can't forget Darkover, and makes his  way back to what he feels is his home planet--though he doesn't really feel  that he fits in anywhere.<br />He wears a mysterious jewel, that he secretly  hope will unlock his hazy past, reveal his heritage--and maybe even  establish him as the long lost heir to a kingdom.  Turns out he isn't far  from the truth, and as the adventure unfolds the mysteries become  increasingly complex.<br />This novel focuses on the Comyn, the noble caste  with psi powers, and their fascinating world.

It is a hardcore bondage, dominance and  discipline novel that does a very good job of marrying the erotic with the  literary, making it a very engaging read.  Olivia is a suffragette in  Victorian England who has pissed off the wrong powerful man, who takes it  upon himself to teach Olivia that far from being his equal, she is actually  suited only to be his pleasure slave.  The capture, training, discipline  and play scenes are all at a grippingly intense level, that is both hugely  erotic and impossible to put down.  Olivia's transition and acceptance, her  emotional reactions to the experience and her balance between shame and  arousal add a dimension to the novel that is both exciting and  engaging.<br />The short excerpt between the two novels is badly written,  unerotic, and unnecessary, but takes up very little space so is hardly  worth mentioning.<br />The second novel, Lucy, is even more of a hardcore,  heavy bondage and discipline novel than the first.  Lucy is a hapless  captive taken to be a love slave by ruthlessly cruel captors.  Her  emotional turmoil is less developed, and her transitions are  disappointingly fake and shallow (particularly after the masterful, pun  intended, emotional development we were treated to in Olivia).  However,  this novel makes up for poor writing with inventive scenes of pain,  degradation, and creative bondage.<br />If bdsm is what you're into, you'll  enjoy this double dose.	2000-08-02

If you are looking for quality erotica, take my advice and pass on this one.  The stories are loosely constructed excuses for bump and grind sex scenes.  Character development is a foreign concept for this author, and  plot is apparantly a waste of time.  Considering that this is intended to  be hot fiction, I was intensely disappointed, and ended up skimming through  all of Nathan's Cirlce, the first novella, in search of something  stimulating.  <br />I suppose if all you require is a graphic depiction of  clothes tearing, overwhelmed by lust sex scenes, you'll be very happy with  this book.  But if you enjoy a bit more realism, emotion, and character  involvement, you'll be as disappointed as I was.<br />This book is clearly  written by an emotionally immature man, and may find some fans in men of a  similar disposition.  Women will likely be left unfazed by this one.	2000-07-30

I am a fan of Jane Austen's Emma, and really enjoyed Hollywood's rendition of the novel, and came away from both sharing a bit of Emma's resentment towards Jane Fairfax.  So it is quite an accomplishment to write a novel  that so quickly and deftly turned my sympathies and interests towards a  previously unliked character.<br />Aiken's Jane Fairfax fleshes out the  childhood histories of both leading ladies (Emma and Jane), and fills in  the back story of their relationship and temperaments.  <br />It is  fascinating to read the story that takes place prior to the time period  where 'Emma' is focused, but even more interesting to read the shifted  perspective once the two storylines sync up.  <br />Finally, the book is so  well-written, so closely adhering to Jane Austen's own style, that you can  convince yourself you are reading a long lost manuscript from Austen  herself.  And as the tale unfolds, and Jane's perspective reveals more of  Emma's character than we even knew before, Austen's 'Emma' becomes an even  better realized, more ironic, and wryer look at social folly.<br />I  definitely recommend this novel to any Austen fan, particularly those  familiar with 'Emma.'	2000-07-28
US	52645574	R2HQURGBVXSXGV	1551664461	818422463	The Third Sister	Books	4	26	26	N	Y	Almost Austen	This is a fun read for Austen fans who are drawn to the mood and social nuance of Austen's work.  'The Third Sister' is the continuation of 'Sense and Sensibility.'  We get glimpses into how Eleanor and Marriane are doing  in their new lives and marriages, but the true focus of the story is  Margaret Dashwood, the youngest sister, who has now grown into a beautiful  young woman.  Margaret, it seems, took Marianne's traumatic lessons in love  much more to heart than any of the others.  She's girded herself against  flirtacious rogues like Willoughby, and is prepared to resist their wiles  staunchly.  'The Third Sister' is the tale of Margaret's coming of age, her  adventures in romance, and her mastery of both sense and sensiblity.<br />This  book is well-written in faux-Austenesque prose, and the story is engaging.   But, it's a case of so close, and yet so far for me.  I found it difficult  to overlook the repeated un-Austen-like moments, which kept grounding me in  the counterfeit nature of the work.  Plus, the story itself, while very  like an Austen tale in so many ways, wasn't nearly as gripping, or  tension-filled, as Austen's own novels.  <br />Margaret's character, and that  of Lady Clara, was well-developed.  But her romantic interests were not  given the same amount of attention and motivation, which left their  relationships with Margaret rather pale and unsubstantial.<br />So, I  recommend this book to Austen fanatics for the little bit of escapism it  provides--for those moments when I was able to forget that this book wasn't  written by Austen.  But, be prepared for those moments to be repeatedly  burst by the frequent flaws that continue to announce it an imitation.	2000-07-25

It's the story of a little girl who is experiencing terrifying and painful episodes.  As the story progresses it seems that they may be  the result of a past-life trauma which for some reason she if reliving in  her new body.  The dramatic episodes and mysterious past-life are  fascinating, frightening, and gripping.  It's a great escapist read that  draws you in and keeps you on the edge of your seat.	2000-07-12

It created a feeling, mood, and atmosphere so similar to Austen's original work that I could almost believe I was reading a long-lost manuscript she'd written. I appreciated the  consistency of the characters as well as the introduction of new, very  well-developed characters.  While it was comforting and familiar to see  Elisabeth and Darcy's relationship continue to unfold, I enjoyed the shift  in focus towards Georgiana life and love games.  <br />I really enjoyed  reading this book, and recommend it to any Austen fan, particularly those  who loved Pride And Prejudice.	2000-07-06

There's an interesting premise, a potentially fascinating set of characters, and a grisly set of deaths all based in an atmospheric town.  It should have been a good read.  And, it almost was.  But...<br />The  atmosphere and foreshadowing overwhelm the characters and the story.  The  tension and the mood is laid in so heavy-handed a manner that it's  distracting.  It became a chore to plow through this novel to make it to  the end (though I did, for whatever reason...).  The few 'mysteries' were  incredibly predictable.  The descriptions were so dense that it was tough  to remember what happening in the story, and the caricaturization was so  distracting that it was impossible to care at all for the characters.	2000-07-06

This novel takes an interesting premise, that a person's consciousness can be transplanted into another body, and takes it even further.  This book explores the questions we sometimes consider of what we'd do differently  and how life might be if only we were younger, prettier, richer, sexier,  less tied down, more mature, etc.  <br />While this novel is interesting from  a philosophical and psychological standpoint, it's also a good story.  This  was an engrossing read, one in which I grew to care for the characters and  feel invested in the story.  I enjoyed the unpredicted moments, and  appreciated the intrigues.	2000-07-06
US	52645574	RRXCXAV5UDV3R	155970375X	231481016	The Secret Diary of Anne Boleyn	Books	4	5	7	N	N	A fun peak into a maybe history...	I've always been fascinated by Anne Boleyn and Henry the VIII.  This novel, which portrays itself as the long hidden journal of Anne Boleyn, tracing her from her early years at court, through her tumultuous years as  Henry's virgin mistress, to her tragic years as his queen until days before  her death.  Quite a lot of the story seems to be based on historic facts  (though I don't claim to have studied the period, and could have been  deceived by this well-written, acurate sounding fiction).  <br />Not only is  Anne's story compelling, as told through her diary entries, but we are  reading along with her daughter Queen Elizabeth during the early years of  her reign.  We witness Elizabeth's shifting attitude toward her mother as  she gains insight into her life through the journal.  The novel does as  much to illuminate Elizabeth's character as it does to illustrate  Anne's.<br />I really enjoyed reading this book, and recommend it highly.	2000-07-06
US	52645574	R2EPYXBKYPY8LM	1893337006	151271676	Letters from Pemberley, the First Year: A Continuation of Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice	Books	3	12	12	N	Y	Sweet, but unsatisfying...	As a Jane Austen enthusiast I've finally turned to Austen-extension books like this sequel and the new series of Jane Austen-as-sleuth novels.  Letters from Pemberly did a good job at maintaining the mood and flow of  Ausen's work, but failed to draw me into the story itself.  The one-sided  letter writing format of the piece put a barrier up that was tough to get  past.  And, while it was interesting (in an academic sort of way) to figure  out which Austen character was being alluded to (characters from other  Austen novels are incorporated into this piece using different names)I  found it more of a distraction than a benefit to the story.<br />I don't want  to sound completely critical, since I did enjoy this pleasant book...I had  just hoped for more.  I suppose I hoped for the magic of Austen, which is  too tall an order for this author.	2000-07-06

This is one of the better Jury novels in recent times, although the end became obvious mid-way through the book.  The characters were better fleshed out, and closer to early works, than they had been in the previous  few novels.  It was a good read.	1999-04-14
