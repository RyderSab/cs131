One of the abilities of the Star Trek franchise has been the ability to alleviate a potential cliche in a story by bringing a bit of humor in. A time travel scenario can be really hackneyed and lame except for the fact that this one gets a good laugh out of it. Like Kirk and Spock wandering around San Francisco traffic without a working knowledge of profanity. Most of us know how Kirk & co use a borrowed Klingon ship to go back to our time when the humpbacked whale was not yet extinct so that they could bring a couple of them forward in time to tell the mysterious probe to shut down the hurricane already, we hoid ya da foist time--if not from reviews, then by seeing the movie. One scene that got ad-libbed into this novelization didn't make the screen, though. Remember if you will the sequence where Kirk pauses by the checkout of a restaurant and hands Spock an after-dinner mint (\\"Don't say I never gave you anything\\"/ \\"Why would I say that, Captain?\\")? Now fast forward to the scene where Kirk and Spock find the whales at an aquarium and Spock goes \\"swimmin' wit' da fishes\\" (yeah yeah, whales aren't fish, I know). The scene we didn't get in the movie is right after scientist Gillian gives Spock hell for that little swim. In this book, Kirk gets Spock aside and asks him what's the matter with him. Spock reminds him of the mint and reveals the not widely known medical fact that sucrose has a certain physiological effect on Vulcans. If I'd written this book, I would have also added the above reaction by McCoy.	2005-07-24

This was of course influenced by the liberal media calling Goetz \\"The Subway Vigilante\\". Never mind that the term \\"vigilante\\" really applies to lynch mob situations where a posse not sanctioned by the law goes out and murders someone they consider guilty of a crime. It does not mean the actual would-be crime victim who's already in the crosshairs and as far as he knows has only seconds to live if he doesn't act p.d.q. But my neighbors and acquaintances were brainwashed (we all were to some extent) into thinking that street punks were themselves victims of a hostile and uncaring society. They were only kids and had the standard adolescent schoolboy machismo, so they were only fooling around. Plus, Goetz has a very German name, so everyone branded him with a mental swastika. I think it was at that point that society tried and convicted Goetz in their own hearts as a cold-blooded slayer of four young kids. Never mind that none of us had been on that subway train ourselves, urban mass transit being a hunting ground for human predators the world over. The legacy of those days, when public opinion was beginning to run towards cutting \\"the disadvantaged\\" as much slack as possible, has over two sorry decades come to its fruition. The only times I ever rode a New York subway were well before those day, and I wouldn't send my worst enemy down into one today. I tend to stay out of hard-core urban areas period, sticking to the 'burbs and rural areas, where law and order hasn't yet completely collapsed.	2005-06-01

First off, I have to say that I always read Patrick Robinson under the self-imposed caveat that he's no Clancy. It's the same spirit by which I listen to Godsmack even though they're nowhere near as talented guitar-wise as Robin Trower nor as creative as Dream Theater. As such, what you get in this story is largely a Bond flick of a book--all action and not much character development. But then, I've loved Bond flicks ever since I saw Goldfinger as a teenager, so there you go. Okay, there's an exception in the curmudgeonly Admiral Arnold Morgan, but after all, Robinson has had several books to round out this old war horse. That's the advantage to having the same character in several books. And I don't have the same difficulty with the Ray Kerman character some other readers have. A guy who's been a British subject long enough to have served as a Special Forces-level soldier in Her Majesty's army would never cross over to the other side? Then how do you explain Cat Stevens, a Greco-English pop star, becoming a Muslim? But the basic premise itself is implausible to say the least. A bunch of Arab extremists get hold of a Chinese-owned Russian-built attack sub and decide to and a sunday punch on The Great Satan with its cruise missiles. That's where the PC bunch will get their first snit from. That's two nations many consider as victims of right-wing American xenophobia dissed in the same plot. Fun wow. But our villains plan to use the sub's missiles to knock the side off an island volcano in the Atlantic and cause a tsunami that would wipe out the East Coast. They give America a demonstration by causing an artificial eruption of Mount St. Helens. Actually, most real-world terrorist groups would get their jollies if they could accomplish that feat alone. To find out how to do it, the bad guys kidnap an eminent English vulcanologist, squeeze him for the info, then dump him in the Thames. One tends to wonder if any such experts really know how to actually make a volcano erupt, much less pass that on to someone else in a short period of time. Even a \\"student\\" with some expertise already. That's where this book reads a bit 007. I mean, Gold-fingaaahhhh! Or maybe more like Blofeld. Where the PC weenies are bound to go into overdrive is their tendency to forget that books like this are ADVENTURES, hear what I'm saying? Adventure stories have a good guy and a bad guy. Take that element away and it's about as entertaining as Ultra Slim-Fast is delightful to the palate. Really, after I take into accounting that this is not literature as such, that Robinson is no Pat Conroy, or even a Clive Cussler, the places I feel that Robinson went wrong here is that there are times where he has Morgan's wife Kathy sounding like a bt of a bimbo, where her appearance in earlier books indicate she is no such thing. Plus, there's my usual picky-picky that Robinson's American characters sometimes use British colloquialisms. Being that, as Robinson's bio indicates, he lives in the States as well as his native Ireland, you'd think he'd be more conversant in American slang, or, failing that, just have his Yanks speak a bit more formally.upt, much less pass that on to someone else in a short period of time.

Cussler's veteran hero Dirk Pitt has stood him (and us) in good stead over the years. Cussler has even had the good manners not to pretend that time stands still for Pitt the way it has for James Bond through more than four authors over half a century (\\"Casino Royale\\" was released in 1953). Now it has me wondering whether or not Pitt is about to retire. He's become very serious about his longtime love Representative Loren Smith. There's a strong hint that Pitt is about to be promoted. His long-lost twin son and daughter have come back into his life and are following in his footsteps with NUMA (it's them who discover a potential biological disaster in the Caribbean that may be man-made and deliberate). For years Cussler has been introducing a slightly-younger hero into the NUMA ranks with the help of co-author Paul Kemprecos. But is Cussler going to do a Tom Clancy and also bring Dirk Pitt Junior in as a hero in his own right? It seems possible as two generations of Pitts go after a mega-rich villain very much in the Goldfinger mold. There's one bit of irony here as life imitates art. This book came out in hardcover last November, at the end of the Atlantic hurricane season. Central to the first half of the story is a huge storm so big and nasty that NOAA scientists skip several letters of the alphabet to name it after axe murderer Lizzie Borden. Several months later, between the release of the two editions, we in Florida get clobbered in the real world by a record-setting four humongous blows.	2004-12-20

Kind if like the way some music listeners can't stand artists with tendencies towards 10-minute plus tracks on their albums. Taking Jack Ryan Senior back to his youth was not going to work in the long term--how many prequels can an author get away with? So he has brought to manhood the aging Ryan's kid \\"Little Jack\\", who is more of a man of action than his father originally was. If you will recall, the Old Man started off as an ex-Marine academic who rose to the occaision when confronted with situations in need for a hero. Which ultimately included the Presidency of the United States. One flaw here is that we never got very many glimpses of Jack Junior's childhood in earlier books to give us a foundation for his evolution into a superagent. Nor do we find out here how the Caruso Brothers are related to the Ryan family. Jack Senior's side or Cathy's side? After all, the Ryan series has mentioned no Ryan or Muller siblings. In a way, this book is heavily influnced by Clancy's own \\"Rainbow Six\\" in the way a major terrorist incident is involved, except for the twist that the Carusos luck onto one \\"theater of operations\\" by just happening to be shopping at that mall. If the book seems a bit one-dimensional, it's because there are only three sub-plots going on under the central plot--what the bad guys are doing, what Jack is doing and what the Carusos are doing at a given point in time. Bond books aren't that much different through four authors. It's only since Clancy came on the scene that we've gotten this John Jakes multi-strand aspect to action thrillers. There is one departure early on where a loose-cannon member or the terrorist group murders an Israeli Mossad agent in a public john, an act disapproved of by his leaders due to its potential to screw up the main mission. As for Clancy's imprinting allegedly jingoistic cant upon the dialogue of his characters, he's been doing that for years--get used to it, got that? All I can tell you is that Clancy and I are both of the same generation--a generation who decided when we were twentysomething punk kids on the edge of being used as cannon fodder in the Vietnam War that patriotism just ain't cool, man. To practically call Clancy a fascist provides a clue that apparently not all of us grew up. If you pay attention to what other generations have to say about us \\"Boomers\\" as a group, you ain't gonna find universal worship, hear what I'm saying? And I'm surprised that there isn't more disapproval of the Clint Eastwood-ish that way Jack Junior deals with a major player in the terrorist group in the end. But then again, this book has just came out in mass-market as I write this review. It was in my most recent Amazon buy.

Tom Clancy's Jack Ryan books of recent years have been real epics: they have rivalled Stephen King's blockbusters for size, and King himself called his own tendency in that direction \\"diarrhea of the word processor\\". This one's a little ole thing by comparison: only 600 or so pages. But think back to the oldies like \\"Red October\\", if you will. Those earlier efforts weren't exactly gargantuan either. And if you're expecting a lot of shoot-'em-up and aerial dogfights like Robby Jackson gets into off the USS Jerry Ford or whatever (or Mr. Clark's latest SEAL mission), maybe it will help to remember that Clancy's \\"Op-Center\\", \\"Power Plays\\" and \\"NetForce\\" action yarns are not only a separate body of work--Clancy doesn't even write those himself anyway. In the same way \\"Patriot Games\\" was a prequel to \\"Red October\\", this book is a prequel to \\"Cardinal Of the Kremlin\\", mostly covering the Foleys' \\"rookie season\\" in Moscow. People familiar with \\"Cardinal\\" will remember that the bulk of that book's narrative was a lot of Moscow intrigue based in the Politburo and Dzerzhinskiy Square. And I'm not really convinced that this book is necessarily a tie-in for the next Afleck movie. Not that I really think Clancy exactly scored in taking the Ryan saga back two decades--he didn't, not entirely. You will notice that Ryan often talks like more like his modern-day self than the talented rookie still in search of his identity as a character during the Reagan administration. Plus, I find Ed Foley's earliest contact with his first Soviet \\"source\\" a bit far-fetched. Read those scenes on the Metro with Zaitsev not entirely sure who Foley is other than an American who works at the Embassy, but the guy still passes Ed data that could land him in a basement interrogation room in the Lubyanka! He didn't get to the rank he holds with that kind of recklessness. But Clancy does bag 4 stars from me (instead of his usual 5) on the speculative premise of the KGB maybe pulling the strings of the attempted hit on the Pope back then. And he's just careful enough to keep Ryan on the fairly distant periphery of that \\"case\\". I'm just hoping that the next book which begins the career of \\"Little Jack\\" is believable. After all, when they did that same number in the form of \\"James Bond jr.\\", it was a Saturday morning cartoon adventure. I'll try to approach that one with a suitable mixture of open mind and healthy skepticism when I read it. I agree that Clancy has taken President Jack as far as he can as a lead player, but the logical move would be to continue the \\"Rainbow Six\\" series with Clark and son-in-law Chavez.mpted hit on the Pope back then.

Especially when you add the fairly good success of two of the spinoffs. Can it be that sometimes the supposedly airhead TV viewer knows a good story better than their allegedly more \\"thinking\\" printed-word counterparts? The other day I read a letter on the TV Guide \\"letters\\" page that condemned \\"Law & Order\\" as \\"self-righteous\\". Okay, it's clear by creator Dick Wolf's tendency to write cop shows that his work sort of constitutes a \\"bully pulpit\\" on the issue of criminal justice. But to call someone who believes in the real law and order enough to base a body of entertainment work on it \\"self-righteous\\" is a very worrisome statement on just how far we've sunk as a society into moral relativism. Apparently, nowadays we'd rather \\"git et up\\" by society's human predators than \\"imposing on their rights\\" by standing up for what's right and wrong, huh? Those of us tied to the \\"idiot box\\" seem to see this series as worthwhile enough that we stick with it more that its cast can. None of the cast and characters with the original series back in its premiere season are still with it today. One of the spinoffs absorbed an actor and his character from a now-defunct series not done by Wolf (Richard Belzer as \\"Munch\\", originally from \\"Homicide: Life On the Street\\"). So that ought to tell you that Wolf strikes a chord with his audience. Which means he ought to be able to extend that into print.	2003-07-31

In the beginning of the original story, the reader is stunned and infuriated at the way she objectifies people--they're only \\"real\\" insofar as they relate to her. But then a war comes along, turns her world upside down and gives her the much-needed smack upside the head people of privilege hardly ever get in the real world. So by the time that story's thousand-or-so pages are through, she has become a tower of strength to the people around her. But more important to that, she now has a clear realization of her responsibility to those who look to her and can't survive without her strength. That earlier book's identity and unwritten subtitle as \\"The Most Powerful Love Story Of All Time\\" is but a part of the main story as a whole. But nobody's perfect, even after paying all sorts of dues, and one obsession remains neither resolved nor outgrown at the end. Having just lost Rhett, she's determined to get him back. Therein lies the transition over to this book. Alexandra Ripley's other work indicates clearly that she's a writer of romances. So she does the cliche thing. The hero of the story has just received a psychological \\"haymaker\\" and gets \\"decked\\". So as the old song goes, she picks herself up, dusts herself off, and starts all over again (doop-dee-doo) here in volume two. She does the defeated hero thing of going far away to recover from the defeat. In this case, back to her father's Auld Sod of Ireland, where she's showered with the acclaim due the big shot American Cousin. Of course, this story is about a lot more than this pilgrimage, but it's still as a whole a misinterpretation of the main premise of the book it's supposed to a sequel to. \\"Gone With the Wind\\" is a work of historical fiction, telling on the story of a rich lady whose storybook world is \\"rent asunder\\" by the Civil War, but Our Heroine gets through it by not being as effete and (sniff) wishy-washy. as those around her. This book is simply a romance with a historical setting. Probably a good romance for all that. But hardly the landmark of American literature GWTW is. That's what you get when you base a sequel on only part of the premise of the original, I guess.elling on the story of a rich lady whose storybook world is \\"rent asunder\\" by the Civil War, but Our Heroine gets through it by not being as effete and (sniff) wishy-washy. as those around her.

Scarlett O'Hara makes you wince at her infuriating shallowness earlier in the story. You can spot it in a conversation between herself and Ashley Wilkes, the man she wants to steal away from Melanie Hamilton. Ashley comments that Rhett Butler (who Scarlett has just seen for the first time) looks like one of the Borgias. Scarlett asks which family they are--she doesn't know them. Ashley patiently explains that they're Italians. \\"Oh,\\" says Scarlett dismissively. \\"Foreigners.\\" The type of prideful ignorance that my own working class demographic (\\"crackers\\" back in those days) expresses like this; \\"I'm dumb as hell and proud of it.\\" One thing the movie doesn't capture by a long shot with Vivien Leigh as Scarlett and Olivia DeHavilland as Melanie is that these girls are teenagers, antebellum \\"valley girls\\". So actually, what do you expect? Basically, Melanie beats Scarlett out for Ashley's affections becase she is nowhere near as immature. But Scarlett's father frequently comments on her \\"willfulness\\", possibly without realizing himself that it's a clue to a titanic courage in his firstborn. In the ensuing story, the Civil War grinds up people and land. Melanie, Scarlett's onetime despised rival, becomes dependent upon her. Ashley is destroyed in spirit as well--a rich dandy doesn't have the moxie to endure war when it lands in his backyard. The main reason Scarlett ends up getting involved with Rhett is that he's the only man with her level of guts. Scarlett reminds me of Pat Conroy's \\"Great Santini\\" character--at first you can't stand her, you thank God no one like her is close to you, but when the chips are down, she's a survivor. And people associated with her survive as well. One thing this book points out is that the ugliness of war is a force of human nature, and people who think themselves insulated from it, or \\"above war's barbarism\\" wind up finding out the hard way that they're dead wrong. Now if only our present-day sheltered middle class and \\"thinking people\\" could face that inescapable truth...ly our present-day sheltered middle class and \\"thinking people\\" could face that inescapable truth...	2003-07-30

The late Robert H. Rimmer was the best of the late 20th century utopian novelists. Most of Rimmer's work was unfortunately of the \\"fictional manifesto\\" type--more statement than story--except for the one whose title I paraphrase above: \\"The Rebellion Of Yale Marratt\\"--that one was a rather stirring romance despite its unconventionality. But until \\"Stranger In a Strange Land\\", Heinlein was the dean of the solid \\"space opera\\". From him you got sci-fi, not preaching. He was still readable at the Young Adult level when Asimov was beginning to become a bit too intellectual for the common man. Where Heinlein transcended pulp was the character-driven flavor of his books: \\"The Rolling Stones\\", \\"Starship Trooper\\" (nothing like that moronic X-Box game of a movie, thank God!), \\"The Red Planet\\", Podkayne Of Mars\\", you name it. This story starts out promising, to be sure. The first manned mission to Mars comes up missing, and when they send the next mission 25 years later (World War III held things up), they find no survivors of the first mission except a young man who is the son of two of the crew mambers, conceived on Mars. He's still alive because the Martians found him and cared for him after the deaths of his parents and their crewmates. But he doesn't know how to be human, and much of the first half of this story deals with this culture shock experience. He has a lot more than triple gravity to deal with here. He's befriended by his nurse at the hospital, who is the first to try to understand him as a person rather than a patient or case study. She sneaks him out of the hospital and stashes him at the country estate of an iconoclastic rich friend of the reporter she's dating. This guy is both a doctor and lawyer with an irreverent viewpoint of both professions. At this point, the book starts to become quasi-Rimmer. How to deal with culture shock? Most everybody adapts, but the Man From Mars does a one-eighty and sets out to bend \\"culture\\" to his way of thinking. He borrows a page from a rich-and-cheesy televangelist he was exposed to and sets up a new religion that's basically Martian philosophy for Earth human consumption, with fringe benefits like out-of-body travel, teleportation and psychokinesis. It's the best way to transcend the base instincts and mean-spiritedness of a society that gets off more on making war than making love, a society that cherishes worldly goods over human dignity, yadda-yadda-yadda. Our Hero is such a babe magnet that he can score with any woman he knows, including all three of his benefactor's beautiful secretaries, an ex-stripper he brings to the Faith, and even wins the nurse away from her reporter beau and makes him content with it! When I first read this story, I was in my twenties, my hair down to my shoulders, my all-purpose accolade to anything that impressed me was \\"far out\\", and my choice for a replacement National Anthem was \\"Easy To Be Hard\\" from the musical \\"Hair\\":<br />\\"How can people be so heartless?<br />How can people be so cruel?<br />Easy to be hard, easy to say no.\\"<br />Today it makes me wince at the wishful-thinking trip I was into back then. The \\"Establishment\\" was my enemy back then, and I rejoiced whenever the Man From Mars, my fictional ally, fought back and outmaneuvered them. We all knew so much back then. We all knew what \\"true evil\\" was, and hey man, it sure wasn't the taboos the \\"pigs\\" imposed on us. I mean, like, what a bummer--everything that felt good was forbidden! But none of us wet-behind-the-ears know-it-alls could forsee religious fanatic bandits smacking two jumbo jets into two skyscrapers in the same town where \\"Hair\\" premiered. I strongly disagree with reviewers who say this book has \\"staying power\\". It's very dated and it's very ideology-specific. And I can attest to the fact a single reader can change his mind bigtime over the years on worldview, much less entertainment choices.ars on worldview, much less entertainment choices.	2003-07-17
US	52204092	R2TVM1JA2WE7HD	0553271369	409895538	The Lords of Discipline	Books	4	2	8	N	N	A well-crafted caricature of the American military academy	There are times when I consider Pat Conroy to be the Faulkner of today--he brings a similar southern accent to the niche of 20th century American literature which has \\"Papa\\" Hemingway as its patriarch. And there's always a bit of Conroy's ongoing crusade for social justice in every book. The autobiographical \\"The Water Is Wide\\" stands as his credentials that he puts his money where his mouth is--buy a Conroy book and you get his alter ego \\"Conrack\\" as a bonus contributor. But I have no choice but to conclude that polemic somewhat overwhelms storytelling in this book. What you have here is a first-person \\"memoir\\" of cadet Will McLean's experiences at the ficticious Carolina Military Institute. Despite the military character of the school, Will's only real talents are those of basketball player and social commentator. He is by his own admission a do-gooder, to the extent that the school's fatherly dean of students appoints him as an unofficial student guidance counselor/ guardian angel for the school's first African-American cadet. Even when Will falls in love, it's with a girl who's alternately in need of a shoulder to cry on and a convenient target to take her rage out on. He doesn't quite come out and say that's what he's there for, but you can tell he feels that way. His three best friends are his roommates; a scion of Charleston aristocracy targeted by excessive hazing because of his effeteness and two streetwise New York Little Italy types who  their more bourgeois fellow cadets consider riffraff but are too tough for them to kick around. The proper \\"Three Musketeer\\" sidekicks to a kid who acquantances call sanctimonious and actually understands why they say that about him. This book has a lot of self-analytical soliloquies like that, almost to the detriment of narrative. It's easy to see what bothers Pat Conroy the most--prejudice and elitism. So he creates a like-minded protagonist who--would yew buh-lieve?-- goes and joins a military school! And that bit about the sinister, mysterious \\"Ten\\", an elite corps who goes about cleansing the school of nerds, wimps and minorities! My own alma mater had an adminstration ban when I attended on any Greek system on the grounds that it \\"encouraged elitism\\". There's no such rule at my old school today, though. I guess you have to understand the times in which this story is both written and set. The late 1960s/ early 1970s were a titanic near-civil-war in which the whole country was caught up in left versus right, when one side called anyone who dared to disagree a \\"commie\\" and the other side used \\"fascist\\" as its generic negative. Small wonder that, a generation later, American politics are so partisan that whichever side is elected, the other side starts quoting Jefferson--you know, the part about \\"overthrowing\\"?

US	52204092	R33R9MQ2ZY4193	0451208811	41838335	Blood Orchid (Holly Barker)	Books	4	1	1	N	N	I'm reminded of what Kate Mulgrew said...	...about her character Captain Janeway on \\"Star Trek: Voyager\\"--\\"She doesn't have to act like a captain, she IS the captain\\". You get that sense with small town Florida police chief Holly Barker, my second-favorite Stuart Woods character (my favorite is a compound one--the Lee family of Delano GA and I'm glad Woods continues to keep them going). Barker doesn't have to prove a thing about being a command-level cop--her role as one is self-evident. Like a lot of small town police chiefs, as well as lieutenants and captains on larger forces, Holly is a retired MP officer. This is kind of an extension of the concept represented by the Tucker Watts character in Woods' \\"Chiefs\\"--if a person is qualified for a position, you don't need tokenism. Watts and Holly each became police chiefs in different eras of American social evolution, and their interaction with other characters in their respective stories reflects that. But now I think I know where TV's \\"Crossing Jordan\\" got the idea of a heroine whose father is a combination mentor and Doctor Watson, as represented by Ham Barker, Holly's retired Army sergeant father. In this story, the ritzy Palmetto Gardens community is back in the forefront under new management as Blood Orchid, and the new owner is avuncular retired New York developer Ed Shine. And like before, there's some shady stuff going down there. It all starts when someone takes a shot at Holly and Shine--it seems there was competition in the bidding for the place and the also-rans are some pretty sore losers who shoot rather than cry in their beer. Then Holly is taking flying lessons from Ham's new girlfriend when they fly over her place and this van is parked there that doesn't belong. She surprises a burglar and gets clocked as the reward for her quick action. Then the sniper who went after her and Ed turns up in the river, swimmin' wit' da fishes. The Miami Organization are into this bigtime, and Holly takes refuge at Blood Orchid with Ed. Like another reader, I have difficulties with that one. Holly's cop and MP instincts appear to have gone south here. Despite her relationship with her father, this is no vulnerable daddy's girl who will immediately run to an available shoulder to cry on. Holly's long service in law enforcement has given her too much insight into human nature to be that naiive--first-impression of anyone doesn't get carved in stone with someone like her. But that's the only drawback here, the only reason this book didn't get 5 stars. Beyond that, here's hoping this story is part three of a long series rather than the final chapter to a trilogy.I have difficulties with that one.

US	52204092	R3EKZGNIYSUJ7	0136089844	490073426	My Shadow Ran Fast	Books	5	6	16	N	N	Sands mistakenly credits others...	...for how he was turned around. I first read this book as a summer orientation assignment just prior to my freshman year in college, and I guess it's a good thing that I still own that copy, given its availability at the moment. I guess it was a key influence to a kid of my generation who was just beginning several decades of wishful-thinking liberalism. Particularly where law and order is concerned--this is the autobiography of a man who claims to have been set on the right path by a number of people, one of whom was the warden at San Quentin. So you have to take with a grain of salt Sands' claim that he was rehabilitated from criminal status by the people he thanks with this book. In truth, Sands clearly admits being traumatized by an abusive mother and a semi-absentee father, and in rebellion, pulled a couple of \\"young hood\\" stickup jobs, wound up in \\"Q\\" and drew the attention of Warden Clinton Duffy, who from Sands' accounts became the surrogate father he had to wait for too long for, but who fortunately came into his life before it was too late. One thing Sands doesn't seem to realize here, however, is that he never was a bona-fide criminal--just a mistreated kid who took out his rage on innocent bystanders. Duffy simply spotted that fact and had the ability to deal with Sands in the way he needed. Which is to say there was always hope for this man--something that cannot necessarily be said for every man who winds up \\"in the System\\". After a stint in the Merchant Marine and the Middle Eastern petroleum industry, as well as the entertainment industry, Sands returns to the \\"family business\\", so to speak. Duffy, as well as rehabilitating Sands, had raised an adoptive son who followed in his footsteps as a ciminologist. A later book, \\"The Seven Steps\\", describes the rehabilitation and counseling program Sands creaated which that book is named after, but it's easy to spot the fact that Sands' biggest sucess stories in that book were men with roughly the same accessibilty as he had in their stage of life. Let's face it, gang--Sands was always a man born to help people, not victimize them. He proves this in an unrelated anecdote in this book about nursing back to health a woman friend critically maimed in an accident. There's no doubt, taking Sands' story as a whole, that his brief \\"partial life of crime\\" was but a temporary aberration. Contrary to what I was peer-brainwashed to believe when I first read this book, there are good guys and there are bad guys. This book was written by one of the former--an unusual autobiography of a great man who tells us that if it hadn't been for certain people, he'd have turned out a real scumbag.

US	52204092	R35BMBJS5BNFUX	0312859694	161274602	The Two Georges	Books	4	3	5	N	Y	Wow, they've got some wierd scenaros here!	The central plot is a fairly simple mystery about the theft of a national artistic treasure on tour. But it's set in a 20th century America that's still an English colony. It seems that back in '76 Washington and George III were able to come to terms. So instead of the FBI we've got the Mounties. The story is set in New Liverpool, California, which we now know as Los Angeles. Can you picture L.A. bobbies patrolling Joe Friday's streets? Try Nixon actually living the scenario speculated on back in the 1970s--a car dealer. Or Martin Luther King leaving the ministry to become Governor General in the colonial capitol of Victoria? You know the place--the major river running through it is the Potomac and its best-known suburbs are Georgetown and Arlington. Try authorities who don't always have to knuckle under to a muckraking press who print gossip about the private peccadilloes of princes and princesses. They can't arrest reporters for sedition, mind you. But those same reporters don't get to grill them as if they were criminal suspects either. Anyway, the hero of this story is a Mountie colonel, who's trying to track down Gainsborough's \\"The Two Georges\\", a painting everybody in the Dominion has a print of. It shows Washington and King George signing their historical pact. The thing is a treasure of the Crown. The biggest suspects are a terrorist group called the Sons Of Liberty, who started out as the organization Disney's Johnny Tremaine became a man in. But over the years they've become a haven for foreigner-haters that would have joined the Know-Nothings (if there had been such a group in this scenario) and the racist Klan (obviously there was no Civil War, Reconstruction Period or Nathan Bedford Forrest to bring that outfit into existence). An all-purpose hate group who think they're really freedom fighters but become the logical choice for theories on whodunit. It's entertaining to encounter Anglicisms in the everyday language of this story. All public air travel is by dirigible or rail, the speed that \\"aeroplanes\\" are capable of is only necessary in the military. Freight hauling vehicles are lorries (can you picture a Rural Music Artist singing about being a Lorry-Driving Son Of a Gun?). Given how \\"NYPD Blue's\\" Sipowicz talks, if he was in this story, it would be bloody this and bloody that. I don't know if Harry Turtledove is doing a Ron Goulart number and ghostwriting Richard Dreyfuss' story premise the way Goulart did with William Shatner's books. But this one works out to be a pretty good scenario on how this country would function as a colony of England. From two guys who are neither of them British, no less.is by dirigible or rail, the speed that \\"aeroplanes\\" are capable of is only necessary in the military.

The cover art shows Lee holding a Kalashnikov--talk about every picture tells a story! What's in it for The Boys From Jo-burg? Obviously they reason that a smaller US won't be able to help topple apartheid. Especially if there is also a nation over here who sympathize with their white supremacist views. There's plenty in it for Lee. The obvious one--he doesn't have to lose the war. Plus they bring him nitro pills from the future to halt his occaisional heart attacks. There are a number of side stories here too. Like a buddy sex relationship between a Confederate sergeant and a camp follower--she actually leaves the bawdy house she works at, disguises herself as a teenage boy and enlists so as to covertly set up shop within the infantry company itself. At first there's the expected clientele relationship, then it warms into a friendship because he treats her respectfully, then after Johnny Reb Comes Marching Home, their bond deepens to much more. A quirky twist on the \\"wartime romance\\" cliche, for sure. But there's also a lesson here that transcends the historical setting. The Boys From Jo-burg--known here as the Men From Rivington--resent the fact that the Confederacy by and large doesn't treat \\"kaffirs\\" with the same level of hostility and degradation they do. The \\"n\\" word may be a staple noun south of the Mason-Dixon line--as William Bradford Huie put it, as naturally as you'd say \\"biskits\\"--but most white Southerners know people of color they respect deep down inside more than they do some white folks they know. So the outsiders set about trying to implement change--do as we say or you get no more arms. Only to run into the basic paradox of the Civil War--\\"We fought to protect our sovereignty from the Yankees and we ain't givin' it up to y'all!\\" Outsiders who try to imprint their ideology and agenda on some culture with influence in the guise of \\"help\\" tend to forget that human beings aren't horses, to be approached with a lump of sugar in one hand and a bit and bridle in the other.hite Southerners know people of color they respect deep down inside more than they do some white folks they know.

I mean, we get a lot of stuff in this story that has been told nowhere else in the Star Wars body of work. Like where ruthless bounty hunter Boba Fett came from--a father he takes directly after in all ways, including the Mandalorian armor we now learn here who wore it first. Unlike in the film this book is based on, we get to know Luke Skywalker's Uncle Owen and Aunt Beru when they were an engaged couple. Instead of the embittered hard-bitten moisture farmer of \\"New Hope\\", Owen was once a devoted stepson to Anakin's mother--an adult stepson who calls Shmi \\"Mom\\" rather than by her given name. In the movie, all we saw of the developing romance between Anakin and Padme was some young-couple affectionate horseplay. I have to say, Padme is more of a babe than her not-yet-born daughter will be. We see how far back the cyber-Abbot & Costello byplay of See Threepio and Artoo Deetoo goes--Threepio's ingratitude and whiny self-pity and Artoo's stoic putting up with it as he always comes to the rescue is a generation old. But the Geonosian recycling of DeMille Roman Empire kitsch is a pointed indictment of the death penalty issue. We're expected to believe that it's all mean-spirited (God, that term makes me cringe!), differing only in degree from one society to another. We see it about to be used against political prisoners like Anakin, Padme and Obi Wan--nobody mentions the common criminal. What happens--or is supposed to happen--to home-grown Geonosian murderers, for example? And one leader of the Bad Guys being named \\"kinda-sorta-like\\" Republican cariacture icon and doofus ideologue Newt Gingrich is an aw-come-on if there ever was one. When the original \\"Star Wars\\" first came out, it was a semi-comic sci fi action story that counterbalanced the holier-than-thou preachiness of most films and books of its day. That was what was so great about it--no propaganda outside of the basic issues of good versus evil, which only the moral relativist would call propaganda. I sincerely hope today's \\"Star Wars\\" (the \\"Previous Generation\\") isn't going to do a full one-eighty on us. We're already seeing in the \\"New Jedi Order\\" series that Anakin and Padme's granchildren have the moxie to fight when ya gotta fight.evil, which only the moral relativist would call propaganda.

If that isn't the bottom line of the Holy Scriptures, it makes a pretty good subtotal. Which means that when you do evil, you can't blame it on other people the way you do when you're a child. You especially can't blame it all on some evil charismatic leader in Flip Wilson \\"The Devil Made Me Do It\\"-style. That's why when I claimed to be a liberal in the 1960s and 1970s, I was lying to everyone including myself. At the age I was back then, as well which generation I was part of, peer pressure is everything. But I believed even then that when I did something rotten, it was me that did it, not someone else using me. But it's probably the sociological theme of the Twentieth Century that there's always some evil Svengali like Adolf Hitler who sows death and destruction all over the place, and guess what? It's not the masses' fault that he talked us into it, he played with our heads, y'know? He wielded us like a sword and come on already--can you blame the sword for the blood it sheds? At least the survivors of the Third Reich tried that argument at Nuremburg. And as I recall reading, that cop-out met with very mixed reviews and didn't get very many of them out of some very hard time. And it seems to have crossed over into the Twenty-first Century in the way the world seems so bent on claiming that Saddam is the One And Only Bad Guy--his nation's populace aren't at fault for anything. This book is about yet another such leader, one that's part of the Star Trek universe--Khan Noonien Singh. My very soul rebelled at the idea of him when he first emerged in the \\"Space Seed\\" episode of The Original Series. I went \\"oh geez\\" when he hit the big screen in \\"Wrath Of Khan\\". And if you think I'm any more thrilled at this untold story of his roots, you got anothah think comin'. Here's how you might be able to enjoy this book better than I did. Remember that the goons and thugs who follow Khan in this story are themselves evil people--he didn't make them that way. He simply draws on their inherent evil as an energy resource. That's the way an Aryan supremacist leader explained his group's usage of skinheads as shock troops to an interviewer a few years back, and it was a perfect explanation for the phenomenon. Sure it's possible to manipulate people, to brainwash them--I'm not saying otherwise. But when the followers of an evil person themselves do evil, they're not part of a \\"cult of personality\\" or any scam psychobabble like that. Try to imagine Khan's thugs having to each be answerable for his own sins. Try to avoid the temptation to envision a \\"merciful tribunal\\" letting all the cannon fodder off the hook while they punish only the Big Cheese. The Roman Catholics have it right--their concept of Mea Maxima Culpa is first person singular.in this story are themselves evil people--he didn't make them that way.

Which they also made into a Deep Space Nine series episode, tied in with a novelization. It was there we met the intriguing General Martok, the Klingon warrior hero who fought alongside Benjamin Sisko and his new ops officer Worf in Star Trek's first major war--the Dominion War. If anybody had told me decades before when I saw the Original Series episode \\"Errand Of Mercy\\" that a Klingon general would be an ally without abandoning the Klingon people, I would have laughed. But here was Martok, the quasi-adoptive older brother to gruff and growly but standup guy Worf. So now we knew that a Klingon could be a good sort without having been raised by Earth human foster parents. It was through these two men we learned that. They had never known each other before \\"Klingon\\", but it was as if they'd been raised together. Their paths have crossed since then and they've been a Klingon Dynamic Duo every time. Martok eventually adopted Worf into his newly-established House. And the House of Martok wages a battle of honor in this story that's as epic as something from Tolkien. We get to meet Sirella--\\"Mrs. Martok\\"--plus a woman from a dysfunctional relationship before he met Miss Right, a woman with a score to settle. We meet a Klingon Hitler who wants to restore the Empire to its former warlike \\"greatness\\". I guess it took the man who played Martok on TV to help write this book. Current events seem to have had an effect on this story, though. There's a Klingon home defense force with a name that sounds suspiciously like our own Homeland Security Department. There's a passage in here, though,  that makes me wonder if there will still be Disney theme parks in the 24th Century. At one point Martok is traveling incognito and gives the name \\"Gorsh\\" to a voiceprint locking mechanism. Could it be the Klingon Norman Schwartzkopf came to Earth as a kid and met Goofy?	2003-04-05
US	52204092	R2QHP23IO9MCGP	0515134864	436056065	Turbulence	Books	2	2	4	N	N	And don�t call me Shirley	As I read this book, I kept on flipping back to the covers and inside plates to the book review excerpt blurbs for some sign that this was some sort of dark comedy, but nope-it's supposedly a straight thriller. Some other reviewer suggests that there's movie potential for this story, but I'd say only with Leslie Nielsen as one of the pilots. Or if they think he's too old, maybe David Spade, saying; \\"Buh-bye\\" to hasten someone's departure from the flight deck. And we can have Mad TV alumna Nicole Sullivan do her Vancome Lady shtick as one of the flight attendants. That would greatly aid this caricature of a troubled airline in the aftermath of 9/11's transition to the big screen. Just don't look for me at the box office, okay? Here we have an airline whose personnel take it out on the passengers, and each other. Like a skipper who makes an undergrad-level crude pass at a senior stew. Like a feud between that same stew and her bitchy crew leader-their enmity goes back to when their respective ranks were reversed and she wrote her later-to-be-boss up. So now that the shoe is on the other foot (and the whip is in the other hand), there's warfare between the two that can't help but spill over onto the passengers. But this can't be a comedy, you say. Look at the passengers, for example. A doctor whose wife died on another flight on this same airline is suing the line but is now stuck by circumstance with having to fly with them this time. A nice young African college student having to fly back to Soweto because he can't raise his mother on the phone and God knows what might have happened to her. A middle-age couple whose daughter in school in Switzerland has been critically injured in a car-versus-truck accident and might not live long enough for her folks to get to her side. Okay, but you're forgetting the passenger who's been asked not to use his cell phone, and just because the flight attendant can't explain the rules against that to his satisfaction, goes the Brat Libertarian route and throws a tantrum--after all, anybody who has rules about anything is by definition Big Brother (both B's capitalized, mind you), I've got my rights, I'm a free American, yuh know, yadda-yadda-yadda. Nance is trying to make a point here, but I'm not sure what that point is. And he comes across in this one a lot like a Robin Cook with wings on his collar rather than a stethoscope. You remember Doc Cook, right? He's always been on a soapbox to some extent, but his story quality has declined gradually over the years to where nowadays you get nothing but polemic. Nance is showing signs of that here, but the good news is that he can learn from Cook's mistake. Troubles with any business's solvency can indeed affect the morale of that business's workforce, an airline as much as any other business. That can indeed manifest itself in said employees' attitudes. But I think Nance is wide of the mark when he blames that for passenger attitudes. Flying isn't all that a passenger ever does--they're people, after all. The cell phone incident is a symptom of a much larger problem. Have you ever noticed the growing tendency of people in the aftermath of 9/11 to get petulant about just about everything they don't agree with. The Attorney General takes steps to bolster security and gets called the \\"New Heinrich Himmler\\". No matter which party controls the White House or the Hill, the people who voted for the other party repudiate that government--\\"those blankety-blanks ain't MY government!\\"--yadda-yadda-yadda. Most of the loudest voices in that \\"Poor Me Blues\\" number are of my Baby Boom generation, and sociologists have some theories about us that make me wince. Since 9/11, I've flown two different carriers, one of which had filed Chapter 11 before I showed up at the gate, and I never had any grief with either of them. And none of my fellow passengers on any of the flights acted up either. Maybe that's because we were adults, not overage adolescents dedicated to rooting out rules so as to defy them. Listen up, Nance--you can't blame the airlines or their recent troubles for \\"concourse Marxism\\" in certain of the passenger base--they're that way in more places than at high altitude, dude.ing out rules so as to defy them.

Author Mike Barr is to be commended for not imposing current Trek values on the \\"oldie\\" Trek. After all, what is more ridiculous than a story set many years in the past in which the characters act modern? Kind of like a story about knights and castles in which Richard the Lionhearted loses a gauntlet, revealing a quartz watch, you know? We all remember how the original series always went--Starfleet chasing all over the known galaxy \\"boldly going where no man has gone before\\" and showing up at some planet. The locals proceed to exploit Kirk & Co, insulting him to his face while he tries to reason with them. In fact, Kirk's biggest problems with his superiors safe back on Earth stem from him spotting the fact he's reached an impasse in some cases and can no longer continue turning the other cheek, to their holier-than-thou disapproval of \\"Dirty Jimmy.\\". It isn't until the Next Generation era that it's now normal for captains like Picard to realize that you just can't always take crapola from everyone you meet and not be considered a wuss. In this story, the Enterprise arrives at a planet ruled by a pair of princes who are Siamese Twin brothers after a fairly recent unification move by two warring cultures. I picked up one fact here that I didn't know before--the term \\"Siamese twins\\" comes from history--a pair of Thai rulers who were just that. A Federation ambassador is onsite, trying his best to work with the fairly shaky coalition government. That's the essence of the term \\"coalition\\" anyway--you aren't \\"one people\\" yet. On the Ambassador's staff is Kirk's nephew Peter, son of his late older brother Sam. The issue at hand is possible membership in the Federation, and planets with longer-established central governments have had problems with their own \\"sovereignty\\" reactionaries with that issue, much less this freshman World government. Kirk is equal to the task--any time any of the local bureaucrats tries to get the upper hand by getting hostile, they end up chewing on tinfoil. A car dealer in my area advertises on TV that they'll \\"bend over backwards\\" to make a deal--that dealership isn't \\"Jim Kirk Chevrolet\\". But now that this foundation for the story has been laid, there are a few cliches that taint it. Like the author's descending to kid-book level in describing one of the Ministers as \\"hatchet-faced\\", with a mind to go with her visual ugliness. That's just a notch or so above the fairy tale concept of wicked witches, evil stepmothers and ugly stepsisters. Is this guy serious? With that in the mix, I'm surprised he didn't stoop to having some member of the Enterprise crew referring to the twin Princes as \\"a humanoid pushmi-pullyu\\", with Kirk snapping; \\"Belay that, Mister!\\" out of the corner of his mouth. And rightfully so--the Princes are a pair of very together guys, wise in leadership and not the least bit awkward in what no one present really considers a \\"handicap\\". In fact, one scene at a Royal Ball shows them to be among the best dancers present. Still, Barr should have downsized this story as a YA book, aimed at a pre-adolescent readership who have yet to unlearn prejudice based on superficialities.hman World government.

Stuart Woods first came to my attention in \\"Chiefs\\", the genesis of the Lee Family saga, that family's current generation now represented by President Will Lee, who inherited more than the names of his police chief grandfather and Georgia governor father (\\"Chiefs\\" was their story). Another currently-running series is the Stone Barrington series, whose hero--suave babe-magnet lawyer-investigator--was once a New York City Police detective. Although Barrington seems far too smooth to have ever been an NYPD cop. You see a guy whose name is two last names and you think \\"preppie\\". This story is volume two of the Holly Barker saga, the first book being \\"Orchid Beach\\", the latest being recent hardcover release \\"Blood Orchid\\". The premise of this series is hardly preposterous at all--a lady police chief of a small Florida town who served as an Army MP officer, Since she commanded an MP unit, she was probably a major. Her father is Hamilton \\"Ham\\" Barker, a retired career master sergeant who plays a mentor role. Don't knock it--it works in \\"Crossing Jordan\\". But all in all, Holly strikes me as the type of cop Patricia Cornwell would think up--capable and with enough presence to make her gender a non-issue. She's obviously well past having to prove herself \\"just because she's a girl\\". And, also as Cornwell would write about a lady cop, the emphasis is on putting criminals away like cops are supposed to do, not putting some sneering sexist oinkmeister in his place. Anyway, the story begins with tragedy: on her wedding day, Holly's husband-to-be stops at the bank and gets blown away in a holdup. In the course of the investigation, Holly has to deal with a Bureau agent who faces a dilemma--how does he crowd \\"the locals\\" out of this case when \\"the locals\\" are a good friend? Stone Barrington does a cameo in this story. Will Lee plays an \\"offstage\\" role--he's targeted in a Presidential assassination plot connected with the robbery Holly's fiance died in. Also in the course of the investigation, Holly and her father turn up a supposedly nonexistent town that's an emcampment for a group of local gun nuts who turn out to be The Elect. If you read \\"Grass Roots\\" this group figured in a plot against President Lee when he was still running for the Senate. If at first you don't succeed, yadda-yadda...But somehow, despite all the good foundational elements, some of them proven stuff from Woods' other work, despite the superb quality of Woods' other work--the story just doesn't get off the ground. I've got \\"Orchid Beach\\" on my wishlist--somehow that one got by me. Maybe that one and the new \\"Blood Orchid\\" will prove this book to be a temporary slump. Or maybe Woods shouldn't try to carry on too many concurrent series at once, I don't know.estigation, Holly and her father turn up a supposedly nonexistent town that's an emcampment for a group of local gun nuts who turn out to be The Elect.

Donald Fagen has an old song called \\"I.G.Y.\\" that pokes fun at the whole I.G.Y. kitsch of the late 1950s/ early 1960s, the idea that some day we were going to have all sorts of gizmos given to us by scientists and engineers that would make life a breeze, the world was going to become peaceful, yadda-yadda. In a recent documentary, William Shatner pointed out that Star Trek anticipated a lot of the technology we have today--hand communicators (we call them cell phones), Romulan spaceship cloaking (we have two different \\"stealth\\" warplanes), and one thing that Shatner didn't mention--tricorders. We call those \\"laptops\\" and they're already being upstaged in capapbility by palm pilots that are smaller than anything Spock ever toted around. But one thing hasn't changed. We still kill people wholesale because we're us and they're them. Star Trek has made a few efforts to debunk the early Trek idea of there being groups who are 100% great folks. Like the Vulcans--there was a novel which depicted a Vulcan named Christopher who didn't fit the relentless nobility mold. He went around in his decommissioned Constitution class starship and raised all sorts of hell and had a grand old time. He didn't commit any evil, but mainstream Vulcankind thought he was scum nonetheless. In this series, we have to unlearn the DS9 propaganda that joined Trills consist of a symbiont who's a great person implanted into a humanoid who's also a great person. The result--great person squared. Look at Dax, for example. Its last two hosts have been real 10s. The lovely Jadzia, who could have been Charlie's 89th angel in the timeline. Cutesy cuddly Ezri, who's everybody's cherished kid sister--if they do a DS9 movie with time travel scenes showing Ezri in middle age, they should ask Sally Field. Gidget Goes Bajoran, hear what I'm saying? But let's not forget that Dax also had a host who was a psycho killer. They blew it on that match, Trill cultural pretensions to perfection in the joining process not withstanding. Over this series, we learn that Andorian marriage consists of four spouses. But what if one of those spouses is unbalanced to the point of self-destructiveness? It results in a dysfunctional marriage, no matter how many partners there are to try to balance things out. There are positive notes in this series to be sure. Like the estranged daughter of Commander Vaughan coming back into his life and there being a reconciliation rather than a resumed squabble. Like a Jem'Hadar soldier being sent by his new master Odo to Federation territory for an education. He no doubt knows that his old girlfriend Colonel Kira will do right by the kid. The DS9 franchise has always been the best because it presents a more realistic picture of humanoid nature than the leftover I.G.Y. contrived optimism (\\"What a beautiful world it will be...what a glorious time to be free!\\"--Donald Fagen) which has governed earlier Trek franchises.

About five such books and now you never notice when a new Joe Wambaugh comes out. That's what happens when an author gets tired of same old/ same old and decides to hang a left turn. When an author decides that going for \\"character-driven\\" is an evolutionary step, but forgets that the book should still be story-driven. Trooper Andy Brazil and his bosslady Judy Hammer get major supporting roles here, the intrepid coroner Kay Scarpetta gets a walk-on, but the major players here are a back-east outlaw gang who consider themselves modern day pirates but instead bring more to mind Breslin's \\"The Gang Who Couldn't Shoot Straight\\" (or \\"Johnny Dangerously's\\" crew), as well as the funny-talking residents of an offshore Virginia island who remind me of characters in Stephen King's \\"Rose Madder\\". Seems they hear of a new State Police speeding crackdown with the acronym VASCAR. They mistake that for NASCAR, decide that NASCAR plans to take over their island for a race, and kidnap their part-time dentist in protest. Every few chapters, one State cop with the pen name \\"Trooper Truth\\" releases an essay that's half history lesson and half Dave Barry. And at the moment, I'm dreading the history of modern fiction repeating itself. Are we about to lose another great crime storyteller to a bid for \\"serious\\" author recognition? I sincerely hope not. I've seen too many writers grow weary of being \\"only\\" a crime writer, \\"only\\" a horror writer, \\"only\\" a sci-fi writer, go for \\"bigger things\\"--and wind up dumping their original readerbase. The ones who made them what they were up to that point, you know? Bing-bing...binggggg! The gunshot and ricochet you hear is Patricia Cornwell shooting herself in the foot. We'll know she either missed or dug the bullet out when the next one's about Doc Scarpetta and her loudmouth sidekick Marino.	2002-11-28

I for one was wishing that Puzo had gotten around to a novelization of the \\"Godfather III\\" story that maybe would also round out the Vegas chapters of \\"Godfather II\\" not told in the original novel. But this book works out to be a paradoxical fusion of quasi-scholarly historical novel and a return to the quasi-Robbins style that worked well for him in \\"Fools Die\\". It certainly gives me more details about the Borgia family, and possibly explodes a myth or two about them that people five centuries later accept as the truth. The Lucrezia featured here is hardly the archetype \\"evil woman\\" we see her as today--the lady who among other things inspired the Blood Sweat & Tears hit \\"Lucretia MacEvil\\". In this book she starts out as the sweet daughter of Renaissance Pope Alexander (nee Rodrigo Borgia), who's far too much in love with her brother Cesare to be able to normally relate to her real loves--in fact, Cesare is her only true love. This was a side effect of Daddy Dear arranging for Cesare to take care of her virginity so that the man she marries isn't faced with that task. Well, they do say the road to hell is paved with good intentions. I've read historical references to the Borgias that hint at a certain family moral notoriety, but none of them go into that much detail. Nor do they actually trace the overall evil of the Borgia family back to the Old Man. It does provide some in-depth insight, though, as to one factor about the Papacy that the Protestant Reformation perhaps did its protesting and reforming about. Puzo's Harold Robbins approach in this book does follow the Robbins tradition of hot sex as in his earlier books, without the gratuitous grossout flavor of later Robbins material. Like Cesare's conquest of a warrior princess in more ways than one. But there are a few cameos by other historical figures. Such as Michelangelo's invention of a siege tower--I hadn't known he had a last name. Machiavelli as a Carl Rowan-style political theorist. Da Vinci as he's about to head for Rome with a few ideas for frescos there--ultimately to end up on the ceiling of the Sistine chapel. A historian Puzo certainly wasn't--but you can see that he did his research.l Rowan-style political theorist.

After a downer of a start in \\"Term Limits\\", Vince Flynn has launched on a series of books whose titles derive from poli sci terminology. \\"Term Limits\\" was a perplexing mixture of solid political thriller aimed at the Clancy readerbase and pipe dream of all the anti-government weenies. Fortunately, Flynn settled down a bit in the next two (\\"Third Option\\" and \\"Transfer Of Power\\") and decided to just tell the story. But now I'm beginning to wonder if maybe Flynn was waiting until he acquired a bit more polish before he got back to using entertainment as a bully pulpit. In this one, Saddam Hussein has gotten nukes and live-in tech support from North Korea. It would be a bit of a reach, were it not for the fact that there's ironic precedent for such states throughout recent history to buy weapons from the athiest Reds to wage war against other believers in the One God. But American satellite reconaissance spots the fact that there's a nuke bunker beneath a major Bhagdad hospital. To just flatten the place with a spread of Tomahawks would only play into the hands of those who call us \\"The Great Satan\\". So they send in Mitch Rapp--a hero that's not in the James Bond or Jack Ryan league by a long shot but is engaging enough in his own way--with a commando squad. Meanwhile, Mitch's boss Irene Kennedy is about to go before Congress to be confirmed as the new CIA chief, succeeding the recently deceased Stansfield. The political infighting that accompanies this is the type you always hear the crowd who use the term \\"goverment\\" as a four-letter vulgarism (\\"G-O-V-T\\") claims to be prevalent in Washington to the exclusion of statesmanship. An egotistical blowhard congressman from the President's own party has a personal animosity against Kennedy--he not only doesn't want her in charge of the CIA, he wants her in jail. Never mind that he's one of those people who wants the Agency disbanded anyway. For some strange reason, Flynn has a WW II generation guy using Boomer generation slang (??). And the dude's backed and secretly bankrolled by a sneaky senator from the other party who's the type to shake your hand with one hand and knife you in the back with the other. Are you kidding or what? Maybe I'm a dinosaur, but early this month I stepped behind a curtain and pulled down some levers as my way of expressing my desires for my country. To me, people who just mouth off about how they can't stand their government aren't that different from those who go off and sulk by themselves. Of course it can't have occurred to this bunch that dysfunctional government in a democracy is usually due to an immature electorate. Single-issue and special interest candidates get nominated by single-issue and special interest voters. Just how mature is the impulse to place 100% of the blame elsewhere, huh? I don't know--maybe we should be thankful that Flynn doesn't drown us in Jeffersonian metaphor the way a less skillful writer would. A lot of anti-G flakes I know do that when the only Jefferson they really know anything about is a certain sitcom businessman who calls his wife \\"Wezie\\".g (??).

I'm talking about the Harold Robbins of \\"The Adventurers\\", \\"Never Love a Stranger\\" and \\"A Stone For Danny Fisher\\". Only this one comes across a bit like \\"The Dream Merchants\\" with one of its twin settings in Hollywood, fused with the Vegas scenes that \\"The Godfather\\" only briefly touched on as a place for Fredo to spend his summer vacation. The main character is good-guy minor author Merlyn as a customer in a Vegas casino, with Cully playing second banana as a casino employee on the rise. Merlyn's role model is the more established but crude writer Osano (I didn't catch a first name), who insults women and proteges like Merlyn with equal abandon to cover for the fact that his fame masks his declining talent. The story begins with a mutual friend of the pair breaking the bank at the Xanadu, only to take the elevator up to his hotel room and blow his own brains out. From there it switches back and forth between third-person narrative about Cully and first-person diary-style of Merlyn. We watch while Merlyn struggles with the battle beween creativity and the interference by cast and directors that a screenwriter must endure. Meanwhile back in Vegas, Cully moves through jobs as a dealer, a pit boss and the eyes and ears of owner Gronevelt on his way to the top of the Xanadu heap. Puzo established a name for himself as a writer of Mob stories on the strength of \\"The Godfather\\", but in truth this man also scripted the first two \\"Superman\\" features. As such, it shouldn't come as any surprise that he was also able to handle the character-driven sweeping bio style that made Robbins famous.	2002-11-10

The point they all raise is the obvious one, of course--the central theme of Potter books is sorcery and witchcraft: \\"Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live\\", and so on. ...But Rowling gives her books a family dimension. Her important characters all have families, even if they are lousy ones--Harry's, for example. In this book in particular, we get to meet the large, wacky and loving family of Harry's friend Ron. We already met Ron's brothers as upperclassmen in \\"Sorcerer's Stone\\"--now we meet his parents and kid sister. We meet Draco Malfoy's father and discover why he's so mean-spirited--he's a \\"chip off the old block\\". We get a look backwards in time at \\"dropout\\" Hagrid as a difficult student and Dumbledore as an young professor trying to bring him round, which includes an insight as to why Hagrid failed. Issues like bigotry are addressed--such as the disdain \\"pure-blooded\\" wizards have for those with \\"muggle\\" (non-sorcery people) or mixed (one wizard and one \\"muggle\\") parentage. Purebloods such as Malfoy & Son call them \\"mud-bloods\\"...In truth, this series is in keeping with a lot of other youth-readership fiction. It sends a great message about human dignity--what sort of behavior and attitudes are consistent with it, as well as what sort harm it. When a writer can do that and still tell an enjoyable story, that writer is going to be a big success in the \\"kid book\\" genre...	2002-11-09

Henry Gregor Felsen came closer to the realities of that era, but his best-known books centered on ownership of modified cars. You know--those \\"little deuce coupes\\" the Beach Boys sang about. But this culture in those days regarded all youth not depicted on the \\"Donna Reed Show\\", \\"Ozzie and Harriet\\" and \\"Leave It To Beaver\\" as juvenile delinquents--or at least potentially so--the difference from one kid to another was seen as merely one of degree. But this book--which later was adapted for the screen under the title \\"Because They're Young\\"--tells a pretty readable tale of a high school football player named Jim, his two teammates Buddy and Buck, his cheerleader girlfriend Ricky--and only one \\"hoody type\\"--a troubled kid named Griff who drifts toward crime because of the possible affluence and ego enrichment it can bring. And unlike much of today's fiction about youth, this story does not blur the lines between good and evil. The \\"good guys\\" and the \\"bad guys\\" are clearly identified in a way that would be seen as narrowminded today. It is clear here that--while this book explains why Griff acts as he does--the \\"environmental\\" hypothesis of criminality takes a back seat to the behavioral one. Maybe I'm a bit of a reactionary, but this book makes me nostalgic in more ways than one.	2002-11-09

This book was written during the last few years of the Cold War, when very few \\"experts\\" on the issue could be described as objective. Back then, only two camps were being heard from. One was the \\"gung ho\\" school of thought that admitted that war might not be very desirable, but when your country got a slap in the face from someone \\"over yonder\\", those responsible had to be taught a lesson. That of course is the product of nationalism having been confused with patriotism--the terms are not identical. The other was the pacifist school of thought, which maintained that any enemy can be reasoned with and should be at all costs, and that anyone in uniform is by definition a bloodthirsty human predator. The first is the product of a bottomless naiivete about human nature and ignorance of how societies other than one's own think--the second forgets that it's the criminal, not the soldier, who's a predator in human vesture. Out of curiosity, I viewed the PBS series based on this book. I found myself intrigued by Dyer's observation that the way to make a fighting man out of a young man raised to believe that killing people is wrong is to strongly imply the enemy aren't really people. When you get right down to it, that is borne out by the historical wartime habit of referring to the enemy by demonizing the enemy and referring to him in subhuman terms. Another of Dyer's comments that interested me was the observation that a nation that piles up stockpiles of weapons in preparation for war will sooner or later get that war. Dyer of course isn't the only writer who's been able to look at war in such terms--Herman Wouk postscripted \\"War and Remembrance\\" with the comment that either war is finished or we are. The sad irony of our age is that some of us may be able to view war with this level of objectivity, but most of us still haven't outgrown nationalism--a phenomenon which Dyer correctly identifies as the root cause of war.le to view war with this level of objectivity, but most of us still haven't outgrown nationalism--a phenomenon which Dyer correctly identifies as the root cause of war.	2002-11-08

Maybe it's time for Robin Cook to do what he went to med school for, or retire--one of the two. His characters become more and more cookie-cutter with every book. Plus he seems intent on picking up every medical front page story and running with it--in this case, stem cell research and human cloning. The technology is believable, due to the fact that Cook is a doc. After all, Joe Wambaugh wrote good cop books because he was one. Likewise Grisham, because he's a lawyer. But the characters, for crying out loud! Two grad students donate eggs to a fertility clinic to pick up extra cash. Then the next thing you know, one of them decides now that it's too late that she wants to know what happens to hers. Despite the fact that they told her up front that it was against policy. So the pair go undercover to snoop for the info. Once dresses up as a cliche bimbo, the other goes for the opposite extreme. They get jobs in the place. The computer guy is the cliche computer nerd, immaturity and social ineptness and all. The teaser chapter is even worse--an earlier donor dies on the table because of a surgical blunder. I guess somebody has to croak early on to make it a suspense story, right? Cook apparently thinks so--everything he writes starts out that way. Maybe his weakness is rapid-fire publication--22 books in 27 years. Crichton has published 13 in 33 years, and each of his books shows the greater amount of time spent on it. Or maybe it wouldn't be a good idea for Cook to go back into practice after all. I can see him having trouble with hospital privieges. With his gadfly approach to hot-button medical issues, I'd be a bit leery about letting him work in any hospital I was admistrator of.	2002-11-04

When I was in Florida last Christmas for the Holidays, I made the mistake of remarking about the issue, that the whole thing was turning into a 21st Century American mantra; \\"Hare Krishna, Hare Potter, Potter Potter, Hare Hare\\".

Jacen Solo shares the limelight with only one other person--mystic Vergere in her first starring role. This is quite a departure from other NJO novels, which at this point in the timeline revolve around everyone else but Jacen--he's MIA. This story is not for the faint at heart--much of the early chapters center on the pain suffered by Jacen while he's serving as an experimental animal in the custody of Vergere, until he learns to master that pain. There's a bit of explicit carnage in the book as well. The whole Y-V cycle has a dark tone to it, but this story well surpasses even that. Jacen also learns from Vergere that there's more than one perspective about the Force--his own is a bit simplistic and dogmatic. Which makes its own kind of sense--a new generation of Jedi aren't likely to have the same old philosophies as taught by Yoda and Kenobi. But one of the basic tenets of Japanese Moritist psychology surfaces here when Jacen comments at one point that the greatest weakness of the Yuuzhan Vong is their insistence on making over the Galaxy into what they think it should be as opposed to coming to terms with it as it actually is. Anybody who thinks this story is going to be wall-to-wall X-wing dogfights and turbolaser volleys is advised to skip this one. If Matthew Stover wasn't a psych major in college, it was the field of study next in line.	2002-10-30

A decade later, on the threshold of the Peace Now era, Joseph Heller would give us \\"Catch 22\\", a story of a bomber crewman and his ongoing identity crisis. John Farris' \\"Glover\\" was the story of a tough-guy soldier at play in the English countryside. Evan Hunter's \\"Sons\\" dealt in part with the issue of bomber crewman and locals in WW II Italy. See the contrast? It was no biggie to be candid during the 'Sixties era about the tendency of occupation soldiers to treat their unwilling hosts as less than people--Gwynne Dyer once said that the only foolproof way of turning a civilian into a fighting man is to include some form of suggestion that the enemy aren't people in his training. But back in the early 'Fifties when this book was written, popular fiction hardly ever approached the issue of American occupation of a defeated enemy from any side but that of the Pentagon. In this story, GI Walter Mosca gets involved in a local shackup arrangement in Germany at the end of WW II, comes home to find that he can no longer relate to the Girl He Left Behind, so he returns to Germany as a civilian employee to seek out the girl he hadn't realized he was falling for. Her effect on him causes him to be a lot more analytical of his own behavior towards the locals in general, that of his colleagues as well--but more than that, it also gives him a view of the perspective of the people he's there to help \\"keep in line\\". All sorts of things can happen to a person's worldview when he becomes romantically involved outside his native culture. I have no actual details on which to base this, but I wouldn't be a bit surprised if the late Mario Puzo drew on his own experiences in service during WW II as source material. He wouldn't be the first.ng WW II as source material. He wouldn't be the first.	2002-10-28

It's a bit of a cliche about the spouse of a TV cop that he or she has problems with that mate's career to the point of being whiny and self-pitying. Look at Faith Yokas' husband Fred on \\"Third Watch\\". Remember Lacy's husband Harvey on \\"Cagney & Lacy\\"? Or all the wives of other fictional lawmen. I suppose it makes the character less one-dimensional than in the old days--nobody knew or cared who Sergeant Friday went home to. That's what makes the story of Andorian Starfleet officer Thri'shar and his family an annoying distraction to the main story of the Defiant's current mission, which is where Shar himself is at the moment. He's up to his butt in alligators in the Gamma Quadrant and his spouses back on the station do little else but whine about how self-centered he is to be away from them--and even battle amongst themselves over this non-issue. To the point of waging a violent domestic battle in Quark's bar, necessitating the intervention of security chief Ro Laren, as well as that of Sickbay. It's not as much a case of \\"we'll miss you while you're gone\\" as it is \\"we're going to be a bunch of overage brats until you drop everything and get back here--NOW!\\" The problem isn't helped much by an explanation during the story by an Andorian diplomat that this mentality on the part of Andorian families is a symptom of a societal worry that the race is headed for distinction, so everyone is mega-obsessed with the whole issue. Don't get me wrong--for there to be side-issues involving pivotal characters in a story does indeed make a story more character-driven, but when one of those narrative \\"tributaries\\" takes over almost half of a book, that's crossing the line...The Deep Space Nine franchise remains the best of them all...	2002-10-24

The inhabitants of space habitat Rotor, like the Spacers from Asimov's \\"Robots\\" series, are more highly-evolved than the lowlifes here on Earth. Which is why they don't live in this lousy sinkhole anymore. It seems that Earthlings 700 years from now personify that old song by War; \\"The World Is a Ghetto\\". The problem is that some 21st Century readers come from my trailer trash demographic and don't respond well to elitism. Now the Rotorians have spotted a dwarf star that's on its way to a collision with Earth, and you can tell by the way the act that they consider their discovery as involving a dilemma. Is this old ball of mud--known during the primieval 20th Century as the Big Blue Marble--worth saving? So they spend most of the book in windy philosophizing over it. Among the worst is the teenage Marlene, daughter of the astronomer who made the discovery, whose great obsession is that she thinks her talents as an instinctive behavioralist is an ability to read people's minds. Were it not for the fact that she's so arrogant about it, she might grow up to be a pretty decent shrink. She reminds me of the supporting character Mary Anne, daughter of Conroy's \\"The Great Santini\\", whose mother warns her that her intellect, too frequently expressed, makes her come across a know-it-all. If only Marlene's mom would tell her that! Don't get me wrong--a bit of philosophy is great in a sci-fi book or it's nothing but pulp space opera. The book then becomes more about people than rocket ships and rises above junior high level to reach us grownups. Asimov proves that in his other works. But when you let that aspect take over, as Asimov does here, and combine it with smug elitism, you end up with a yarn that's not only tedious--it's annoying.	2002-10-16

The Freedom Party, partially founded by embittered Great War veteran Jake Featherston, draws on racism, demagoguery and runaway economic inflation due to war reparations. They should have beaten the damnyankees in the war, should have kept minorities \\"in their place\\" by putting down their Socialist uprising before it had a chance to cripple the war effort--but the mainstream leadership in Richmond sold everyone out. As one of the central characters in this book, Featherston becomes a Dixie would-be Fuehrer running against a moderate mainstream candidate who's the direct descendant of a Civil War general. In the USA, Socialist Party standard bearer Eugene Debs sees the handwriting on the wall and awards his delegate base to labor expert Upton Sinclair, after having the torch passed to him by former President Abe Lincoln, who wasn't assassinated as in the real world. Among his grassroots supporters is Flora Hamburger, a charming and idealistic Congresswoman from New York. Being of Cold War roots, I find it peculiar to be turned on by a \\"commie\\"! Enough to forget the fact that Socialists obsesses about class struggle to the point of belief that \\"defense\\" and \\"foreign policy\\" as such are unneccessary--who gives a hoot about all that nationalist crapola? The answer to that question is that you can repudiate nationalism all you want--until some nation that believes in it attacks you. I admire Turtledove's capacity to recognize that fact despite the fact that he's clearly not a believer in nationalism himself. But after all, he would have that clear a vision on weltpolitik--he was once a history prof. In conquered Canada, three stories unfold. One is of Arthur MacGregor, an embittered Manitoba farmer whose son was executed for sabotage by occupying US forces and plots revenge against the elderly General Custer, who Turtledove also keeps alive for purposes of the story. In the puppet \\"republic\\" of Quebec, Lucien Galtier must come to terms with his daughter's marriage to an American doctor who stayed on as a resident alien when the military pulled out. Far from the Ugly American, Galtier's new son-in-law hauls his college French out of mothballs and speaks only that language around his in-laws. Elsewhere, former officer of occupying forces John Moss falls for a local woman and sets up a law practice so as to be near her and possibly win her love. This book was supposed to have been a fourth volume to Turtledove's \\"Great War\\" series, but is now the first volume in what might end up another trilogy based on a post-Great War era. I found Turtledove's \\"Colonization\\" trilogy a bit tiresome, based as it was on his previous \\"Worldwar\\" tetralogy. That saga had been based on a rather weak sci-fi premise \\"borrowed\\" from TV's \\"V\\" miniseries and had proven that, as an alternative-history author, Turtledove isn't much of a sci-fi writer.

The strongest message I can see this book delivering is the tenacity of elitism. So many political movements try to place the blame for the class system or pecking order on the system they are fighting, when in truth it's a basic facet of human nature. Under communist rule, nations merely trade one elite for another--the bourgeoisie for the Party \\"central committees\\". Human nature at its current stage of evolution is not ready for equality. We must never confuse resentment at being lower than we might prefer in the \\"food chain\\" with a bona fide belief in equality. It's not the same, as revolutions have proven again and again. The classic saying \\"everyone is created equal, but some are more equal than others\\" originated right here in these pages. The allegory to that in this book is the way the pigs lead the \\"revolution\\" against the human farmer, and become the new ruling class in the process. As with communism, this is done with a lot of \\"progressive\\" doctrine and holier-than-thou pontificating--put 'em under your thumb and make them think they like it. The definition of \\"treason\\" or \\"sedition\\" remains the same--disagreement with the status quo.

We saw it in the way the supernatural aspect of a lot of his work often took a back seat to the very real evil in human nature. The title character in \\"Carrie\\", for example, had destructive psychokinetic powers, but we also saw the cruelty of her \\"normal\\" classmates and the fulminating hatred from her religious fanatic mother as the main catalyst. In this story, however, the paranormal powers of the condemned man John Coffey do only good, while the real evil in this story happens at the hands of fellow inmate \\"Wild Bill\\" and sadistic guard Percy. King skillfully avoids the bleeding heart cliche of \\"hacks\\", \\"bulls\\" and \\"screws\\" tormenting \\"solid cons\\" that writers of the generation we share often fall into--our story's main character is tough but goodhearted cellblock commander Paul Edgecombe, who is the narrator of this tale from his residence in a senior care facility, one of whose male nurses bullies him. Paul's immediate superior has a terminally ill wife, and the man's agony is heartrending. Paul's second-in-command Brutus is one of those stolid types whose loyalty to his boss is the sort every command-level officer in a stressful, dangerous job yearns for. The message in this book is clear, as it has been for a long time in King's work. Saturday afternoon Dracula and Frankenstein movies are chump change in terms of evil when compared with the real stuff you can find in everyday people. I have just one problem with that, however. There's always the suggestion in a King story that there are enough heroes around to clean up the carnage, put band aids on everyone's boo-boos and punish the creeps responsible by the \\"epilogue\\" chapter. Which does not always happen in real life, and \\"civilization\\" today has less power to keep order than in past years, not more. That's the danger in allegorical fiction--does every reader really know the difference deep down? Can we remind ourselves that the happy ending in a book is not ncessarily our birthright once we close the cover? I'm not so sure--the slippery slope which law and order is on these days is paralleled by our growing talent at denial of that fact.w the difference deep down?

Half a century of what took most of that time to win the name \\"political correctness\\" in entertainment and literature has with very few exceptions stripped fiction of all of its bad guys. The Star Wars body of work has been as guilty as any of being so phobic about the demonization of enemies. In the original trilogy, Sith Lord Darth Vader mutated from a harsh villain who strangles a subordinate with telekinesis in \\"New Hope\\" to Luke Skywalker's poor misguided daddy who helps him knock off Emperor Palpatine in the end of \\"Return Of the Jedi\\". Possibly the best motto of the misguided bleeding-heart second half of the 20th Century is the Dylan lyric \\"...don't hate nothin' at all except hatred...\\" from his song \\"It's Alright Ma\\". In addition to turning fiction into a mostly-bland diet of do-gooding flawed anti-heros and the \\"dysfunctional individuals\\" they contend with by trying to \\"reason\\" with them, the real world has suffered from this scourge as well. The whole concept of good and evil, of right and wrong, is now known as \\"absolutism\\" and the relativism that remains has made us all meat on the hoof for the world's human predators. If you're forbidden to hate, you're fair game for those who still can. Fortunately, the New Millennium has ushered in a much more believable Star Wars--the \\"New Jedi Order\\"--with bad guys you don't have to feel guilty about booing. In a visceral sense, they give you the creeps, and the authors in this cycle don't make the error of suggesting that it would be best to view them with \\"more understanding\\" or an \\"open mind\\". Instead, they've created a collaborationist cabal called the \\"Peace Brigade\\" who fight against their own culture and are nearly as much of a hassle as the \\"Vong\\" themselves--the \\"enemy within\\" counterpart to the \\"enemy without\\". The Yuuzhan Vong are an allegory to every human culture that takes advantage of the civilized world's compulsion for \\"fair play\\" and its resultant vulnerability to thugs and creeps. Military historian Gwynne Dyer once said that the best way to make warriors of people who were raised to believe killing people is wrong is to suggest that the enemy aren't people. The \\"Vong\\" never have seen other cultures in the Galaxy as people in the first place. The Yuuzhan Vong are an allegory to every culture who places the stamp of The Almighty on their own subhuman blood lust. Try to tell me that the person at Lucas Inc who came up with the idea of the \\"Vong\\" wasn't thinking of the bunch who use the term \\"jihad\\" or the ones who sing \\"The Old Rugged Cross\\" assembled around a burning cross and I'll laugh in your face. The new generation of Jedi have a situation on their hands a lot grimmer than Master Luke had to face in his X-wing when he was young, and I have to say that they seem to have the moxie to deal with it.

In my own native Rochester NY, a feminist group tried to pressure an area party house to overturn their decision to hire him to perform there, in complete ignorance of the fact that an entertainment venue caters to the people who will show up at a performance, not those who they know won't. It's amazing what a contradiction in terms the word \\"know-it-all\\" is. When I bought a copy of the book, fellow liberals among my friends sneered, their line of reasoning being not wanting to dirty their hands with it, throw their money away on it, yadda-yadda. My own line of reasoning was that knowing in some detail what is wrongheaded about the other side is essential to really knowing that they're wrongheaded. It was in that spririt that my high school poli sci class made Marx's \\"Manifesto\\" required reading. I remain a solid anti-communist to this day, however. But about Limbaugh, my bourgeois liberal friends preferred being peer-pressured into repudiating him word-unheard or by hearsay at best. Stimulus: \\"Rush Limbaugh\\". Pavlovian response: \\"Grrrr!\\" Hey, why contaminate your mind with facts when zealotry is the best course? But a redneck like me needs facts--we're insufferable that way. Like little kids who keep asking \\"why\\", to Mommy's escalating annoyance. It was at that point that I began to doubt my own credentials as a bona fide liberal. I could talk the talk and walk the walk, but I couldn't manage the mindless conformity that all ideologues must have, left or right. I could speak the language, but I wasn't really a native. To this day, I'm still not one of Limbaugh's \\"dittoheads\\". That would require the same level of conditioned response that being a \\"true liberal\\" does. But as a consequence of owning this book, when I dis this dweeb, I can provide chapter and verse, by direct quote from The Man Himself, as to just why he is a dweeb.	2002-09-21

Anakin (later to be known as Darth Vader) was Kenobi's first apprentice as a rookie Jedi Master, and as such, was affected by his mentor's inexperience, not to mention his own personality as a pretty reckless kid. We got our first glimpse of Little Hot Rod Anakin in \\"Phantom Menace\\"--how was a greenhorn instructor supposed to handle that loose turbolaser? Of course, we all know now that Kenobi's second shot at the Skywalker bloodline was a huge success--the New Jedi Order cycle has Luke as a next-generation Kenobi whose talent is such that he can also maintain a marriage. Other prequel material here covers the genesis of Grand Moff Tarkin--in this story, he's only a Commander, but already a key figure in the work in progress that will become the Empire. We learn in this story that the Empire has always been based on human supremacy in the galaxy (\\"Ven Herr Tarkin tells us ve iss der master race, ve heil (braaak!) heil (braaak!) right in Herr Tarkin's face\\"). When you consider this book as a Star Wars historical document, the story of a planet that grows starships instead of building them is almost incidental. If you've read the Yuuzhan Vong cycle, that angle is hauntingly familiar. Greg Bear, who usually goes for material that is sometimes so grandiose and bloated that it can lose the basic sci fi reader in the shuffle, has gone for the typical \\"people story\\" found in the Star Wars universe, and I must say he can do it as well as any.	2002-08-31

In that one, Gant is called upon to investigate an airline tragedy that ends up having corporate skulduggery at its roots--thus its title. The Gant of the printed page is a bit different from the Gant on the screen--in action roles, Eastwood always plays his characters as laconic and menacing. This Gant is more intense, more of an envelope-pusher. As such, he's a lot like David Morrell's Rambo--you'd never make the connection on the screen.	2002-08-15

In this story, unpretentious but super-talented astronomer/ pilot Mike Call gets \\"downsized\\" (you'll see by his description of his stature why that's a pun) by a previous employer and lands a job in a small industry that has just stumbled upon a revolutionary invention with industrial and space flight implications. Not only that--Call finds a bona-fide nice girl as a love interest. There are some tense moments involving industrial espionage--remember, this story was written back when it wasn't trendy to see \\"the Feds\\" as villains yet. Call me a reactionary (and I'll thank you for the compliment), but it's great to read a story that has good guys as heroes rather than dysfunctional anti-heroes.	2002-08-03

Where \\"On the Beach\\" was written from a British/ Australian perspective, this book is based in the American south, perhaps making Pat Frank the Pat Conroy of post-apocalyptic fiction. In 1960, during the height of the Cold War, Randy Bragg, descendant of an old Florida family, gets a heads-up from his career Air Force brother and prepares his family and his town for when \\"the button gets pushed\\". Younger readers who didn't live through the Cold War might find this story a bit campy, but as one of the kids taught by teachers to hide under my desk, I'm in no position to scoff. The book's short length (by today's standards) might make you take it for pulp fiction at first glance, but the fact that it's still in print four decades later is a testament to its quality. Rather than just crank this thing out, certain that no one would notice the picky details, Frank did his homework on this story. Even down to the dog tag on the collar of a wild stray German shepherd in one passage--as a one-time resident of Rochester NY the same as that dog, I can testify to the fact that the phone exchange on his tag really did exist back in those days...	2002-07-19

More and more, he's metamorphosing into a fusion of the \\"older brother\\" of Tom Clancy hero Jack Ryan and a still-active clone of \\"JAG\\"'s Admiral Chegwidden. For all that, the concept of a terrorist stunt pulled by an uneasy coalition of European robber barons and American computer hackers has an interesting Clive Cussler feel to it. But I was happier when Jake was still a naval \\"Top Gun\\" brought to the printed page by one hell of a war storyteller--and as such, there was more to him than a flyin'-and-shootin' videogame. You can do that in a good book. Try this on for size: our Bad Guys manage to boost a new high-tech sub on its maiden voyage. Anybody old enough to remember \\"Voyage To the Bottom Of the Sea\\"? This boat is the good old Seaview, that vessel's futuristic technology having become next year's newly-developed hardware. Crewed by a bunch of modern-day pirates who kill each other as easily as they kill the Navy crews they overpower to take the boat and other Navy crews who come after them. Earlier in the story, our hackers managed to send a new defense satellite launch off course and into the drink--that's why the sub is needed: to go get it and steal it. Admiral Jake Grafton's efforts to solve this case are vastly helped by the fact that the hackers who downed the satellite are nothing but highly-paid \\"server fodder\\" for the euro-tycoons they're working for, and the tycoons themselves are each out for Number One. Jake actually gets more help from them than he does from sidekick Toad Tarkington, who's just a gofer. I see that fortyish Toad is still only a Commander, the protracted adolescent streak that keeps him from his fourth stripe less obvious here than in previous books. You have to check some of those out to know what I mean. And I see the bit about the \\"undersea mount that might have once been Atlantis\\" from some previous book is still here--that's a bit TOO much Cussler. Hell, I don't remember--maybe that came from an actual Cussler book. You can see what I mean, right? Here a bit of Cussler, there a bit of Clancy, there a bit of Edward Beach--it seems like the more Coonts tries to \\"broaden\\" his material, the more derivative of other authors he becomes. Which is a bummer, given that he already established a presence as an author from his books set when Jake was still in the cockpit.Hell, I don't remember--maybe that came from an actual Cussler book.

Maybe this implies that three centuries from now historians won't remember that this legend is Scottish in origin, not Irish. Or maybe Graf can't tell the difference between the two cultures, I don't know. But passages about a 14-year-old Jim Kirk are of interest, as is the friction between the middle-aged Chekov and his younger self. The Generation Gap run amuck, I guess--the idea of the intolerance of older people for the young even applying to their younger selves. Graf even hints at the older Chekov's Russian accent fading slightly over two decades. Nice touch there--other authors might have had his command of English as his second language remaining the same over the years without improvement. Hey, you speak a new language longer, you speak it better, you know? Another cute linguistic twist is how members of the crew use their command of other Earth languages at one point to fool enemy aliens--the only human language they know is English. Not that the crowd who think that immigrant Americans should never use their mother tongue here would approve--I guess the Federation would be too multicultural for their taste.	2002-07-06

As will the folks who hope for air skirmishes between Pappy and his \\"friendly enemy\\", the genial English-fluent \\"Tommy\\" Hirachi. But General Moore was a real person--you'll find him here as the tough-but-fair \\"old man\\" he was in the series. As was Colonel Lard, who was so unable to judge Boyington by his effectiveness instead of spit and polish that Moore frequently had to intercede between the two. But the Solomon Slot period depicted in the series was but a part of a much wider autobiography written here by Boyington himself. Boyington is brutally candid about his own alcoholism in this book, plus he gives a lot more credit to Naval fliers saving his butt on at least one occaision than the \\"branch-o-centric\\" version of him as played by Conrad ever would have. I was amused to find mention of Japanese night bomber \\"Washing Machine Charlie\\" and his nuisance raids which kept the base awake largely through the out-of-synch twin engines which gave him his name--my memories of the series supplied me with the sound--an oscillation that sounded just like my mother's Easy Spin Dry pre-automatic washer.	2002-06-22

We've learned in earlier books that The Union is a descendent of the old Union Corse from the \\"On Her Majesty's Secret Service\\" days. Plus, the Union Corse's old boss--Marc Ange Draco--is still alive. Another thing Marc Ange was--for a few hours he was Bond's father in law by virtue of Bond's all too brief marriage to his daughter Teresa \\"Tracy\\" DiVienzo. The post-Fleming Bonds have all suffered from a time warp paradox--Fleming's Bond was a British naval veteran of World War II, which would make him about 75 by \\"real time\\". Previous books by both New Bond authors have almost ignored events of the Fleming epoch as a way of dodging that paradox. But one point of amusement in this book is the way Bond has bought the auctioned-off \\"Goldfinger\\" car--only to wish it still had all the cool gadgets it did when it was still in Q's charge.	2002-06-09

There are so many character cliches in this book that I can't believe this is the guy who gave us Doctors Peter Benton, Doug Roberts, Mark Greene, John Carter, Elizabeth Corday, and (as Corday calls him) \\"Robert Rao-man-ao\\". Not to mention the memorable characters in his other books that gave fellow doctor Robin Cook the idea that maybe he should try writing more than prescriptions. We have a heartless high tech magnate whose company has learned how to send people back to the past. Seven centuries back, to be exact. The trouble is that he regards his people as so expendable that if he were a general he'd be risking court martial. So he sends a gaggle of grad students, archaelogists and physicists back to the Middle Ages, where they meet all sorts of knights who are more hardcases than gallants, monks who are as much scientists in their own right as they are spiritual--you name it. Needless to say, when you go too far back, culture shock can be fatal, which happens all over this story. I found one sort of self-amusement when my inability to mentally pronounce French had me hearing one lord's name--Arnaut de Cervole--as \\"Are Not de Chevrolet\\" in my \\"mind's ear\\". So if it are not a Chevy, then what are it? Not exactly the \\"heartbeat of Medieval France\\", I'll grant you. But I found this book otherwise ambitious beyond the author's command of the subject. Crichton is at his best when more of the story is based on science. This isn't one of those times, I'm afraid.	2002-05-24

Everybody I knew in those days had to be able to discuss it intelligently or risk being thought to have a gap in our characters as people. A folk/ talking blues singer of that era (I forget who) referred to this book in a lyric:<br />\\"...a copy of Kahlil Gibran's 'The Prophet' with all the significant passages highlighted--the whole damn BOOK was highlited...\\"<br />In truth, the whole phenomenon was symptomatic of the societal immaturity of my generation as young adults. It taught us all sorts of theoretical concepts of human nature that were not necessarily reflective of the real world--consideration, the dignity of each person, peace, love, repudiation of prejudice--all of this in a world that anything but reflected such beliefs in Gibran's day. And except for the hippy-dippy pseudo-enlightenment we tried to cram down the world's throat in our day, our peculiar era was no better. We just used Gibran and other such philosophers to peer-pressure one another into self-defeating meekness. If someone you knew was erudite enough to understand philosophy but didn't have the moxie to stand up to people when he should, Gibran was the ideal way to make him a bona fide doormat and make him think he liked it. I won't even try to speculate how \\"relevant\\" Gibran is nowadays. From the perspective of a sadder but wiser man--or at least not quite as stupid--I give you this Sting lyric from the song \\"Consider Me Gone\\" for consideration:<br />\\"To search for perfection<br />Is all very well<br />But to wait for Heaven<br />Is to live here in Hell\\"	2002-05-23

At the end, I was having to stash it in a ziploc bag--I can't really say that about every book I've bought. Let's face it--most of us knew this story first on the screen. This was where we saw Humphrey Bogart as the insecure, embattled Captain Queeg--antihero of a standard sea yarn which was anything but my favorite of his films. Bogie of course played Queeg a lot more macho than he's portrayed here, but the main thing the movie did get right was the character Tom Keefer--a supercilious intellectual snob with a very low opinion of the military and those who serve it. But the main character in this story is young Willie Keith, a spoiled-rich kid who joins the Navy on a whim. The saving grace of this immature Ivy Leaguer, though, is that he lacks the level of arrogance usually expected from his demographic. This is how he manages to become a man, as well as a pretty decent officer--he's just plain willing to learn. This also stands him in good stead in his romance with a girl who's too mature for him but is willing to wait for him to grow up. I won't give away the irony in just what way Willie \\"comes of age\\", but Wouk later was to come up with a fairly similar character in \\"Winds Of War/ War and Remembrance's\\" Byron Henry, also set during World War II. So don't let having seen the film fool you into assuming this book is just another war story--it's a rite-of-passage tale very consistent with more than one other Wouk novel.	2002-05-10

But seriously, this book is a big departure from the theme of Nance's past adventures, which consist mostly of flying and onboard danger, with a little bit of ground perspective of what's going on up there. What we have here is a former US President onboard an airliner while a corrupt South American president tries to have him busted for murder because one casualty of a CIA drug raid was el Presidente's drug lord brother. He then sends a high priced legal hired gun to serve the warrant. So the former US President retains his old law partner as his lawyer. As a result, a lot more of the action takes place on the ground and onboard other planes. For example, there's one tense sequence where the ex-President's lawyer engages an amateur pilot in a tiny Cessna to get him to his overseas flight that's right out of Ernest K. Gann--ice on the wings and screwed-up instruments and what have you. As one media reviewer correctly puts it, this story has as much John Grisham to it as it does of Captain Nance's earlier material. When Stephen Coonts decided to depart from his accustomed fare of Top Gun-type stuff because his fighter jock hero was getting too old for it, it didn't quite work. For Nance to broaden his material a bit, however, seems to be working.	2002-04-13

The depiction of Roberta Lincoln further along in her training as a recruit \\"agent\\" (even though Gary should have also trained her to use that bimbo soprano voice to make people underestimate her).

One big difference between a novel that is made into a movie and a novelization of an existing movie is that you can take the thing to work enjoy during lunch. I mean, the actual story you saw onscreen. Also, it's still there in the bookcase years later. The problem is that novelizations normally go out of print almost as soon as the second-run theaters stop running the flick. Maybe there's a new edition if the networks run the film, usually not. If not for the title, it would be too easy to write this book off based on its shortness, but you have to remember that the story itself only covers a few days. Also, in this book, our cast gets last names that aren't in the stage production or the film: Riff Lorton, Tony Wyzek, Bernardo and Maria Nunez, Chino Martin. One adult gets a real name--youth center operator Murray Benowitz--we used to only know him as \\"Glad Hand\\". Drugstore owner Doc doesn't get one, though. The cops--Schrank and Krupke--don't get first names either. One other thing this book proves--Jerome Preisler and Jack Gregory didn't invent the reverse process of the bringing of a story from the screen to the page. Like the play and the movie, this one is simple, but it's great.	2002-04-06

Particularly raised as I was by a father who called people like Huie's characters \\"Rebs\\". It was another thing entirely to be told later in life by an African-American friend of Alabama roots (where this book is set) that she'd rather live down there than up here in western New York--white people of her home state were less \\"two-faced\\" (her words) about the race issue than we were up here. This book was the first book I ever read that puts a human face on people connected with the Ku Klux Klan. In recent years, I've come to realize that the Klan gave America our earliest experience with terrorism. From right here at home, not foreign shores. But \\"The Klansman\\" presents all of its characters on both sides of the issue as people with real feelings. A bit disconcerting for a kid like me who had a good guy/ bad guy perspective from popular entertainment, which is to say the bad guys are monsters, not people. But then again, Nietzsche once suggested that life's most valuable lessons are anything but easy. This book's anti-hero is Sheriff \\"Big Track\\" Bascomb, a complicated sort of guy who on one side is a Bull Connoresque uniformed soldier for the cause of segregation, but on the other side is a caring husband and father. His teenage son Allen is an embyonic New Southerner whose generation today is in power in states like Alabama. His wife Maybelle doesn't care so much about political issues as she does about the well-being of her family. His best friend is landowner Breck Stancill, whose family traditions lie in the anti-segregationist direction, but in truth, Stancill is a helper of the needy regardless of race. In leaner years, Big Track himself was a beneficiary of that, and is torn between his loyalties to the segregationist cause and his more personal feelings of obligation and gratitude to Stancill, who by his own admission has served as a surrogate older brother to him. Military historian Gwynne Dyer once said that the only way to make a fighting man out of a civilian brought up to believe that it's wrong to kill people is to suggest that the enemy aren't really people. To this day I retain my hostility to racism, but Huie has created a cast of racists here that I can't with any conscience claim aren't real people. Actually, I'm a bit surprised that this book is even available used. After all, not every book that deals with a hot button issue of a particular era can cross the gulf of time into status as a \\"historical novel\\".

A group of early middle agers from Derry, Maine who as a group once did something really great as kids are back together years later facing something horrible. The problem with this book is that it's far too long at just short of 900 pages to be just a Saturday monster movie in print. It also involves too few supporting characters for a story this long. It's far from unusual for King to do grossout, but when that's all there is to one of his books, it's usually a lot shorter. When he does it in epic format (&quot;It&quot;, &quot;The Stand&quot;), he does a &quot;Herman Wouk of horror&quot; number with a heavy-duty story and a whole lot of people involved--the horror aspect is just the nature of the dilemma his protagonists face, the same way Wouk's Henry family faced World War II (&quot;Winds Of War&quot;) and Ferber's Benedict family faced social changes in Texas (&quot;Giant&quot;). Another thing King should watch out for is overuse of school bully scenarios as subplots--in this case, Our Heroes' rescue of a retarded kid who was being picked on when they were kids. 25 or 30 years ago, society in general was a lot more sympathetic towards the weak than it is now. Despite the greater number of mechanisms in place to help the unfortunate, there tends to be a grassroots &quot;human garbage&quot; mentality towards individuals who don't fit in nowadays--sort of a social Darwinism that might have many readers wondering why King brings the juvenile human predator issue into so many of his books. Personally, I don't find it off-putting, but then again I used to be a liberal. And King needs to address a wider readership than us &quot;compassion fascists&quot; if he wants to remain popular.	2001-12-29

So, given such great examples of Patterson's formidable reservoir of charcters, why does this story in the final analysis fall into the stale cliche of a contemporary hot-button issue--that of abortion rights? A new President has to come up with an appointee for the Supreme Court, and it turns out to be none other than Aunt Caroline (Judge Masters has a beloved niece who's actually her out-of-wedlock daughter). Another complication Masters faces is that an old protegee is now handling an abortion case herself. This whole book revolves so much around the &quot;A&quot;-word that it almost feels like an old Irving Wallace book. Maybe instead of &quot;The Seven Minutes&quot;, we have &quot;The Seven Months&quot; here, huh? Okay, maybe that is merely reflective of society's obsession with that issue, but how come hardly anybody realizes that it is after all an obsession? At this point in time, we do indeed have the &quot;pro-choice&quot; and the &quot;pro-life&quot; forces locked in the kind of battle that must have some outsiders asking of us in America: &quot;Is that issue all these people ever think about?&quot; The names for both sides themselves indicate that each considers themselves on a holy crusade--they call each other by the terms &quot;anti-choice&quot; and &quot;baby-killers&quot;. And the irony is that in the middle of the previous century, the anti-abortion movement was an offshoot of what were then called &quot;decency leagues&quot;--they considered unwanted pregnancy to be the original penalty for &quot;illicit&quot; sex, and as such, the most logical deterrent. In that spirit, even contraception was wrong. At the same time, a growing number of their opponents play the gender card nowadays--to prevent a woman from terminating her pregnancy is by definition a subtle form of male domination. That's the whole problem of this book--if there's a story line consistent with what we've come to expect from Patterson, it tends to be obscured by the smoke and flash of political zealotry. So what if Patterson presents both sides of the argument? Why not just tell a good story and never mind EITHER side?

After this book, he decided one was enough, which makes this effort the stronger for all that. Woods has proven that if you don't get too gee-whiz in the Clancy fashion, you can still get the job done. Keep the story simple, avoid Ludlum-style mazes of subplots and gobbledegook, and your reward will be that not that many people will call you a dilletante or a poseur. There's even a bit of Clive Cussler-style huge-evil-plot. Heroine Kate Rule comes off more as a contemporary of Clancy's Jack Ryan than a ripoff in this sort-of prequel to &quot;Grass Roots&quot;. She can kick butt when needed without becoming a cartoonish Wonder Woman clone (as she proves when she nails a guy who's been shadowing her). The Russians as the bad guys aspect of this book can be attributed to the fact that the Cold War wasn't over yet when it was written. We get to see Will Lee as a supporting character while he's still only in a casual relationship with Kate. Plus Will's boss Senator Ben Carr while he still has his health and vitality. So this book is also consistent with the character development we've come to expect of Woods. I love the Lee Family series. I also love Clancy's Jack Ryan books. This book is a fusion of the two that isn't really that incongruous, especially since Woods did it only once.	2001-11-16

At least at first, anyway. Until the Gateway people give their device to each of the sides. The result is a sneak attack on the royal palace of one world that wipes out their royal family except for one pre-adolescent princess (well, they say that one of the Pharaohs was a middle-school age kid). So the Calhoun-Shelbys have each taken their respective ships to one of the worlds involved. This story breathes something of a new life into the series I variously refer to as &quot;Punk Trek&quot; and &quot;Alt Trek&quot;--the New Frontier cycle of books. The &quot;New Wave Frontier&quot; series has thus far been a bit short on any real story lines--it's built instead around &quot;CWA&quot; (Characters With Attitude) and their quirks. Such as a Jean-Claude Van Damme-clone skipper that makes the cowboy Jim Kirk seem like Mister Roberts by comparison. I won't bore you with any more, but the whole idea seems to be a more hip Star Trek for a different generation--I wouldn't be a bit surprised if they use gangsta rap, techno and grunge as sountrack music if they ever (shudder!) do a TV series of this cycle. Another bright spot to this story is the introduction of Arex and Mress from the animated series, in which Arex comes across as the tough cop security officer rather than his rather wooden personality in his old role, and kittenish (in more ways than one) Mress comes across sexier than she could have in Saturday morning cartoons of the 1970s.	2001-11-12

Thoughout his career, Clive Cussler has given us villains mostly in the Dr. No or Goldfinger mode--mercantile tycoon types who pull some sort of mega-holdup that endangers the world. And this continues, despite the success of efforts like &quot;The X Files&quot;, which articulate the current trendy view that Government--an Orwellian &quot;Big Brother&quot;--is the Antichrist. Corporate America is never--repeat--NEVER the bad guy (whatta you, some kinda Red?) except for Bill Gates--he's fair game because he's a nerd. But Cussler still sticks to his Superbad Guys, and as such, makes it clear that he still loves his country. That the weenies who gave us &quot;The X Files&quot; still do is not so clear. In this book, we have a Nordic Valkyrie who's planning up to exploit the growing water shortage and setting up an aqua-OPEC to gouge the thirsty. If you can afford it, bottoms up. If not, you die of thirst. What delicious evil in an age when the &quot;proper term&quot; for evil people is &quot;dysfunctional&quot;! In this time of ambiguities and moral and philosphical relativism, I LOVE an author who calls a spade a spade! To paraphrase 1960s country/ comic singer Larry Verne; &quot;please Mr. Cussler...don'tcha ever go!&quot;	2001-10-17

Barrington simply chases...tail. As his only off-duty activity, it seems. There have been reviews that suggest that this trait likens him to James Bond, but--other than quantity of women--no comparison as far as I can see. Bond's womanizing is semi-misogynistic--there's a place in a 007 book where Bond reflects; &quot;Women are only for recreation, they hang on your gun arm&quot;. As such, no woman every really controls him. Barrington, on the other hand, is forever getting entangled with ladies that friends tell him he's a fool to mess with and getting burned in the process. He starts this book in the process of a wedding with a Mafia princess whom her own brother-in-law tried to warn him away from in a previous book--the brother-in-law is Stone's best friend from his days with the NYPD. He leaves her at the altar to scramble to the aid of an old flame who's suspected of murdering her movie star husband whom she dumped Stone to marry in another previous book. He also gets mixed up with a supporting player from one of Woods' &quot;Lee Family&quot; books (see &quot;Grass Roots&quot;), a Hee Haw Honey who's now a Silver Screen siren. Don't get me wrong--the cases themselves from each of these books (this one no less than the others) provide the type of reading entertainment consistent with a Stuart Woods book--but I wish Stone had some other diversion besides being a ladies' man in the Sicilian sense of the word. If they ever ask me to do a Stone Barrington logo (like the Bond logo with the &quot;7&quot; part of &quot;007&quot; serving as a grip for a Luger), I swear--I'll do a picture of a dog running madly in a VERY tight circle.	2001-10-10

But to the John Jakes of what-if, it could have been real. The America of this story is a pair of third-world nations being supplied by two different superpowers--the Union gets their planes from the Germans and the Confederacy gets theirs from the British. Snoopy's Sopwith fighter is flown by Johnny Reb! I find it a poignant irony to be caught in the middle of this book by the World Trade Center attack on September 11 2001. Of all the books to be reading--a war book, even a fantasy one. This whole series has brought some strange perspectives on early 20th Century America. Southern black people going Communist--I thought that was a Ku Klux Klan fantasy about the Civil Rights struggle. But you get the wierd spectacle of Amos and Andy-style pronunciation of the canned Marxist jargon. Turtledove reminds us, though, that a lovely educated young Congresswoman of the Socialist persuasion doesn't really understand fully the very same rhetoric she herself is parroting. Blind zealotry knows no social or racial barriers, I guess. I'm lucky that I'm too much of a skeptic and cynic to be knee-jerk about my own ideologies--there but for the Grace of God go I! A wounded white Confederate soldier, a wounded black Confederate soldier and several wounded Union soldiers all wind up in the same hospital ward--talk about a micro-war in one room! But within a few days all of these men become introspective and self-analytical enough to be able shoot the bull like any bunch of fighting men. None of them has lost his prejudices, but they end up all treating each other like men. Hollywood is full of stories where a bunch of people magically overcome all of their biases before the end credits, which is naiive. I like Turtledove's treatment here of that issue much better--you have to walk before you can run.	2001-09-15

Little did Sisko know that Jake would serve as the conduit through which his own values would rub off on Nog. We got our first evidence of that from Quark's frequent complaints to his nephew that he was &quot;thinking more like a hew-mon every day&quot;. In the current Deep Space Nine timeline, Nog commands a runabout on a scouting mission in a way that will pave the way for future Ferengi serving in Starfleet--after all, look at the mark Worf made. But by and large, this story is about a culture which reactivates ancient technology to sell to the highest bidder. The dilemma is fairly obvious--everybody knows that no one culture should possess these Gateways--it's equivalent to rogue nations in the real world possessing nukes. But what about Kira? You'll have to see the book itself for that.	2001-09-08

Not many, I'm afraid--this seven-book cycle will turn out to be more than 1/4 of the annual GSTP (Gross Star Trek Product), and that's not counting other multi-book series within the Trek universe this year. It's a tendency towards grandiosity that's a step away from the old fashioned &quot;space opera&quot; format that made Trek the 35-year phenomenon which transcended the vast wasteland of TV where it has its roots--where boredom operates at tachyon speed. Okay, this book has a lot of the aspects that made TNG a success. Like Picard doing his usual thing of gaining the respect of cultures who think the Ferderation is otherwise populated by wusses. This trait in Picard makes him (don't you dare call me disloyal to Kirk!) the best skipper any Enterprise has ever had. We get to see Troi successfully command a ship in battle--being that I'm an admirer of hers, I like to see this strong but delightfully feminine woman get to prove she's more than just a shrink. And I get a kick out of watching her daddy's girl/ doting papa relationship with Picard. Worf shines here as a Federation statesman worthy of a Kissinger or Lodge--I like seeing him as more than just a skillful pair of hands with the bat'leth. But this whole idea of (blaring trumpet fanfare) &quot;major sagas&quot; is not what Star Trek is all about--why not leave that to descendants of Frank Herbert? Followers of Herbert and other &quot;highbrow&quot; SF have always sneered at Trek as being lightweight. Fine--I think of them as elitists and pseudo-intellectuals, got that? I've been a member of the Trek fanbase for all 35 years it's been around--why don't the people back in the real-life Trek Aitch-Cue listen to us like they used to. No more huge sagas! No more huge sagas! No more huge sagas! Or at least fewer of them, okay?	2001-09-03

Of course, these are a product of The Race's technology as the planet Earth becomes their Vietnam/ Afghanistan--a decades-long war they can't seem to win decisively despite superior firepower. We Tosevites (aka &quot;Big Uglies&quot;) have a lot more fight in us than they predicted. Anyway, as you'd expect, humans are hacking into The Race's internet posing as their own people, and their chat rooms are just as inane in message content as the ones we know and love here in the real world. An American guerilla couple exiled by The Race to South Africa are facing culture shock over there--in the real world, they'd be Randy Weaver types with racial attitudes to match. They're involved in the &quot;ginger trade&quot;--if you're familiar with the previous book &quot;Second Contact&quot;, as well as the four volumes of the &quot;Worldwar&quot; series, you'll know that ginger is The Race's equivalent to cocaine. It's addictive, mood-altering--plus it's aphrodisiac to the point of causing gang rape among otherwise respectable Lizards (&quot;Don't bogart that Canada Dry, mah friend. Pass it over to me&quot;). There's a message in this series' ginger-as-dope concept, I think--at least in terms of this new fave-rave ideology going around nowadays. We've all heard it; &quot;Goodness Gracious, it's ever so hard to fight the War On Drugs (sigh) and anyway we're losing (hand across brow to signify weariness). So why not just legalize it all?&quot; One other thing these ginger-pushers encounter are reptiles imported from The Race's homeworld to be used as livestock. Their cabdriver/ guide comments that he hears they taste like chicken. My &quot;mind's ear&quot; actually played back the driver's remark in the voice of that Cajun gator hunter in the SUV commercial. Aaa-eee!	2001-08-23

In this book, Jack tosses his best friend the same sort of spitball and both beneficiaries should have told their benefactors where to stuff this &quot;great honor&quot;. If you read &quot;Role&quot; and its successor &quot;Executive Decisions&quot;, you will know that Robby found getting kicked upstairs to Admiral a very dubious honor indeed-the man was a Navy flyboy and loved it. A vice president I don't remember the name of once commented that each of his predecessors had historically left office a better golfer than when he was sworn in. That's the fate of Top Gun Jackson, whose Secret Service codename is now TOMCAT. Name him after his jet fighter-thanks a heap, Mr. President! Jack himself remains a truly off-balance Leader Of the Free World in this book, so one saving grace of this effort is that a lot more of it is focused on the front line troops like John Clark and Ding Chavez (co-stars of sidestream tale &quot;Rainbow Six&quot;), Russian luminaries Sergey Golovko and Gen. Gennady Bondarenko, and our old friend Chet Nomuri from &quot;Role Of Honor&quot;. Also, &quot;offscreen&quot; character Rev. Hosiah Jackson (we only knew him through son Robby's anecdotes about his childhood) gets a speaking role here through his congregation's outreach aid to a Chinese Baptist preacher. Clancy does sort of recycle one of his old plot premises here-that of &quot;Red Storm Rising&quot;, Clancy's second novel written at a time when he might yet not have had plans for a Ryan series. In that book, the pre-perestroika Soviet Union suffers an oil field disaster that collapses their economy and this moves them to mount an invasion of Western Europe. In this book, a diplomatic atrocity on the part of China, coupled with a refusal by nationalists in Beijing to admit wrong, results in an embargo on trade, which destabilizes their economy. At the same time, Russia becomes the beneficiary of a mineral bonanza in Siberia. The reaction of Beijing to that-&quot;hmmmm&quot;. You know, I'm reading a lot of attempts in other reviews to paint Clancy's work as right-wing manifesto masquerading as entertainment, more specifically the demonization of an enemy nation. The ancient bromide &quot;They don't think the way we do&quot; has been used as a way to avoid understanding the other folks as people for millennia, but in this book BOTH sides use it--and actually they're both right to a very real extent. Clancy takes another opportunity here to trot out his old aphorism about war being a humongous armed robbery, but that's only one theory. Military historian Gwynne Dyer defines it as one nation imposing its will upon another by use of force--that's another. But when you get right down to it, war is also the collision of cultures who don't think alike. And I can't help but see many of the objections here as being an aftereffect of the 1960s/ '70s Peace Movement which I was part of myself back then. After we had accurately spotted the irony that the noisy love-it-or-leave-it bunch seemed to be more nationalists than they were patriots, we fell into the hubris that we could social-engineer that flaw out of the entire human species in a few semesters. A lot of us outgrew that brand of undergrad arrogance but I'm afraid those of us who did can't speak for everyone. Especially when the issue is entertainment, which is first and foremost what Tom Clancy does for his bread and butter. There isn't a damn thing created by anyone that doesn't offend someone. I don't read Tom Clancy for his poli-sci expertise-I've never been particularly impressed with that. Clancy's value to me is as a storyteller. Period. There are products sold here that I wouldn't want if they paid me to take them. So that stuff doesn't wind up on my &quot;wish list&quot; or in my &quot;shopping cart&quot;.

But in this book, Gray shares the limelight with a black Marine general he manipulates into heading up a military operation.

Some of his more recent work has been as much about sex as it has been about character development-and some rather debased sex at that. Which was a shame-over his long career, Harold Robbins has created some of the most interesting and sympathetic characters I have ever encountered in fiction. Film industry pioneers. Union leaders. South American revolutionaries. Young prizefighters. Auto industry pioneers. You name it. This one is the sequel to \\"The Predators\\", the story of a lingerie industry magnate (??) and it's two novels in one-a father and his son. It switches back and forth between the two men in the way Evan Hunter's \\"Sons\\" did with three generations of American fighting men. There's one small flaw in this book which is more amusing than off-putting-in the early stages of father Jerry Cooper's setting up the undie company, he has to deal with some mob types, and I'm afraid Harold Robbins is no Mario Puzo there. You get a family with the name Boiardo and of course the head of the family is called \\"Chef\\". They have a cousin named Napolitano and everybody calls him \\"Ice Cream\\". Otherwise, this is a pretty decent book. Part of Cooper &amp; Son's business dealings involve a subsidiary in Hong Kong around the time of the \\"Handover\\" to China (coincidently, I just finished a Stephen Coonts book set there at that time). Being that clothing is involved, the issue of sweat shop labor comes up. This is hardly a landmark book for Robbins, but it's more consistent with why I was one of his steady readers for decades. What a relief-I thought he was totally losing it. At least he goes out with something readable. Gonna miss ya, old timer.	2001-07-26

Don't get me wrong--I've been keeping up with this series and I intend to keep doing so. But it's Sci Fi Channel Rocketship Avengers fare--the MTV fare of fiction--and meant to be approached as such. I'm reading comparisons to Heinlein in other reviews--well, yeah, but it's the Heinlein of teenage heroes for teenage readers. Shatner's hero Jim is a bit older but is cut from that mold. Shatner tries to bring the feel of these books into adulthood by giving them the noir aspect of his Tek series, but that doesn't make them literature by a country mile. I've been a Shatner fan for decades, but I have to admit that he is narcissistic--and it's that trait that he gives to his heroes: grandiose and &quot;misunderstood&quot;. Decent light reading, but don't expect more than that. After all, there are only so many Donaldsons and Herberts.	2001-07-19

There's a certain attraction to having a main character who has flaws he or she is combatting at least half as hard as the &quot;bad guys&quot;. After all, it's juvenile to expect heroes who can leap tall buildings in a single bound, isn't it? The problem is when you go past the DMZ of mediocrity and wind up with someone who's too dysfunctional to save the day. Kay Scarpetta in this book is hardly the Meryl Streep-esque intrepid lady forensic scientist I've come to admire over the years. She's torn between a paranoia caused by recent events of the last couple of books and the individualistic cussedness that made me a reader of Cornwell books in the first place. The problem is that this stand-alone compulsion now works against her by making her reluctant to reach out to some pretty obvious sources of support. Like the niece who she more than half raised and now wants to help the aunt who was more a mother to her than her real mom. Like her shrink friend who is Scarpetta's own de-facto aunt, but can't get past the barriers. Like her detective friend who's mostly succeeeded in keeping his unrequited crush on her from screwing up the friendship too badly. A word of warning--Cornwell is exaggerating Marino's rather abrasive Sipowicz-clone personality in this book to the extent that if you didn't know him from previous books, you'd write him off as a real a**hole. But as for Scarpetta in this book, it's hard to root for a &quot;good guy&quot; who has an Olive Oyl need to to be rescued from Bluto. After all, who gets to be Popeye? I think the whole anti-hero thing has run its course and needs to be outgrown, by authors and readers alike. Tina Turner once sang &quot;We don't need another hero&quot;. But I think we need this particular hero back.	2001-07-19

He then proceeds to partially become Our Lord's chief apostle--memories from his actual lifetime and ministry, as well as his reactions to what has become of Christianity since his death. The reborn Peter even goes so far as to fall in love with a tour guide in Rome. I like the part about the genial, personable Irish Pope--John Paul has always been likable, but the Pope here is a bona fide heluva nice guy. But a lot of this is been there/ done that. Since nothing is new under the sun, maybe this might be excusable--except that much of this book's &quot;casting&quot; is a near-clone of a single book--Irving Wallace's &quot;The Word&quot;, done about 50 years ago. That one is similar in premise--what if there was a fifth Gospel and it was discovered during the 20th century? In both books, you've got two brilliant and beleagered researchers under fire by the Church bureaucracy--the guy's American, the woman's Italian. In both books, the two fall in love in the process of their work. In both books, the woman researcher is a strong earth mother-type whose character matches her beauty (if they'd done a movie of the Wallace book, I'd say Sophia Loren--if they do one of this book, Marina Sirtis or Julianna Margulies). Like I said, there's nothing new yadda-yadda--but Bailey shouldn't have drawn from the same book. It's almost if not quite plagiarism.	2001-07-14

I'll admit, he skillfully avoids having Grafton turn into an ideologue in his old age the way Clancy sometimes does with Jack Ryan. In this book, Grafton has a logical reason to want to kick butt and take names--after all, a Hong Kong crime lord has kidnaped Jake's wife Callie while they're over there for a symposium she's involved in as a professor. One aspect of the action sequences here sort of pushes the envelope of plausability, though: semi-autonomous battle robots straight out of Greg Bear or The Terminator. It's a bit of an &quot;aw come on&quot;--funnybook technology from an author we've come to know as a lot more realistic than that. One thing you'll notice here--the aforementioned Tarkington is still only a Commander. If you're familiar with that character from earlier Coonts books, what we have there is the eternal post-adolescent who even marriage to the right woman hasn't matured. Even Rita Tarkington's maturity and working for a boss like Grafton hasn't settled this overgrown frat boy down, and I'm glad to see him reduced to a bit part here.	2001-07-13

As a Conroy fan, I don't find it so much a letdown as a change of pace that works well. Will Lee (later on in 2001 he's Presidential candidate Will Lee--but that's another story) is a bit of a stick-at-naught kid who according to his father Billy can't even finish model kits. So he decides to do the cliche &quot;year abroad&quot; thing after he gets his bachelors. He thinks of trying the &quot;free man in Paris&quot; number (you know, like that Joni Mitchell song) but he visits his mother's family in Ireland just in time to land in the middle of the 1960s era of the &quot;troubles&quot;. One hell of a dilemma for a nice Georgia boy who just wants to find himself. As a real-life member of his generation, I was able to relate to that back then. As another reviewer points out, this is volume 2 of the Lee Family Saga (&quot;Chiefs&quot; before it--&quot;Grass Roots&quot; and &quot;The Run&quot; after), but when you look at all four books, I would have to say this is the opener of a Will Lee Trilogy, with &quot;Chiefs&quot; as a prequel. And it stands as proof that Woods can write about more than suspense. A good thing for a reader like me--Pat Conroy books are few and far between.	2001-06-24

There's a Navy admiral patterned after Patton who calls the ambassador that, to the resigned amusement of his secretary/ girlfriend--the guy is such a cliche! When you get to the parts actually involving the sub's crew, this book is okay--intrepid skipper, brave officers and crew--but once you get ashore, watch out! There don't seem to be very many particularly mature people on dry land. Can it really be true that the military mindset about the civilians they lay their lives down for is a bit like the police perspective of us--useless scumbags but they gotta protect us anyway? The Chinese brass come off noticeably more pragmatic--they all seem to have a healthy respect for our country as an adversary. It's no big trick to ignore the swaggering sinophobia in this book--Gwynne Dyer once said that the way you turn a civilian kid into a fighting man is to teach him how to stop thinking of the enemy as people--but I really think Robinson could be another Edward L. Beach if he'd just fact the fact that he doesn't know how to write about landlubbers. Listen up, Cap'n Pat--think Ed Beach, not Herman Wouk, okay?	2001-06-11

Or maybe narrowed down to one nationality--mine. The &quot;art rock is an abomination&quot; mindset came from the American belief that art is art and entertainment is entertainment--the one should not be confused with the other. Art is tedious and entertainment is fun, so when you fuse an art form with an entertainment form, you make tedious what was supposed to have been fun. Macan missed that point entirely, so there was no way he could have made the argument that a lot of us wish we had thought to make 25 years ago--we listened to progressive as an entertainment in the same way we also had Rolling Stones albums in our collection. And as such, I still do. I didn't read music back then and I still can't--as an &quot;artsy-fartsy&quot; snob, I'm a poor example. To me, the younger generation of progressive as represented by Spock's Beard, Dream Theater and Echolyn are just as valid as anything I still own by Gentle Giant, ELP and Yes. That's one point that Macan should have made as well (if it occurred to him at all)--that a lot of us of the original fan base of progressive had fun listening to it, as I'm sure the artists had fun playing it.	2001-04-27

It's quite predictable that purists in either genre will hate this book's aspects of the other--that's a given in fusion forms of anything. But where King surpasses most apocalyptic sci-fi writers--and EVERY other horror writer--is that he has the character development skills usuallly found in authors of bona fide literature. Every character in here is believable. The only larger-than-life type is the main bad guy, who's of supernatural caliber. Randall Flagg seems a fusion of the Revelations Antichrist and Satan himself. As for everyone else, Mother Abagail is a very spiritually-minded elderly black woman whose greatness lies in her sprituality and her simplicity. Stu Redman is a good ole boy, a redneck without any of the flaws commonly associated with the type. Larry Underwood is a minor rock star who doubts his own integrity because people who expect too much of him critique it all the time. Frannie Goldsmith is an attractive young coed with a sensible side inherited from the father she adores. Nick Andros is a very decent guy who happens to be a deaf-mute. Were that not the case, he'd be the stuff of which great men are made. Harold Lauder is a brilliant school nerd type that it would be easy to feel sorry for, were it not for the fact that having been picked on and degraded all his young life has turned him into a very mean-spirited young man. Glen Bateman is a very solid middle-age college professor that might be the absent-minded prof cliche, were it not for the fact that his common sense shares at least equal billing with his intellect. Tom Cullen is a retarded young man who was taught good and evil as a kid, and it stuck. The result--not exactly the sharpest tool in the shed, but one hell of a decent guy. Among Flagg's troops are Lloyd Henreid, a lowlife punk who pulled a stickup which escalated into murder. Julie Lawry is a sluttish teenybop airhead who attracts trouble like a lightning rod. Real life analog--Amy Fisher. Dayna Jurgens is a bit of a paradox--plays with the bad boys but isn't really that bad a person. Another paradox is Nadine Cross, part of Mother Abagail's group until a dream tells her she's supposed to father Flagg's child. Barry Abanks is a former LAPD command cop whose religion is law and order. Not exactly a flaw, except that the good guys don't exactly have a monopoly on it. But you know what the bottom line should be before you file this book under either of the obvious genres? Stephen King just about ALWAYS writes about the struggle between good and evil--once you've spotted that here, you'll be able to pick up on it in his other books. Sci-fi sometimes does that, but it always involves some heoric Captain-Whosisname type. King reminds us of the capacity for good or evil in real people--as well as a great story, this book is the signature work of that side of King's mindset as a writer.--plays with the bad boys but isn't really that bad a person.

Keiko isn't the sensible schoolteacher wife of Miles 'Brien, she's Troi's personal maid. Seven Of Nine isn't a Borg--she's a human agent for Cardassian intelligence. Kira Nerys was always a tough cookie, but this Kira uses that basic strength in the manner of a loathed and feared tyrant. But will you get a load of this universe's Winn? We know her as a smarmy, two-faced religious leader--here she's a mid-level bureacrat trapped between the hammer of higher-ups who don't give a damn about her or her constituents, and the anvil of those constituents, who expect the moon and stars of her (and proabably sulk when they don't get it). Where &quot;our&quot; Winn patronizingly calls Kira &quot;child&quot;, this Winn actually is a dedicated foster parent who has raised several waifs to adulthood. Author Susan Wright may have done a real number on the Troi that one website calls &quot;Beloved Betazoid&quot;, but she has turned the slave-of-expediency Winn into a true woman of courage.	2001-01-04

If co-author Peter David had not joined DeLancie in this book's writing and wrote it himself, he still have would have needed to put DeLancie on his speed dial. That notwithstanding, all this book has going for it is the fact that it's the only one with the Great Omnipotent Smartass himself as main character. Apart from that, it's fairly mediocre as stories go, particularly Peter David material. There are all sorts of borrowed cliches here. The part where the Universe As We Know It begins to come to an end in a humongous whirlpool? Poe's &quot;Descent Into the Maelstrom&quot; gets raided there. The freight train that's been loaded with Good Guys by Bad Guys who are taking them to be exterminated? Any Holocaust story, particularly &quot;War and Remembrance&quot; by Wouk. You get a mental picture of Cardassian stormtroopers bellowing &quot;LOS!....LOS!&quot; as they throw people into the boxcars. Even an in-house cliche--Q can't understand why Data wishes he were human when he's already superior to us. Know what I can't understand? Why that question is still important to Q when Trek writers for both the screen and the page realized it was getting old along about the third season? The Data we know now has outgrown that old Scarecrow Of Oz dilemma. I'm glad I waited for the paperback edition.	2000-12-26

Over the past 10 years or so, Cook has been writing about doctors on crusades against all sorts of evils, drug companies who brainwash doctors into using their stuff, corrupt hospital administrations who turn organ donations into a racket, HMOs--you name it. It's made his writing sound more manifesto than story at times. Now comes a breath of fresh air--a bona-fide S-F adventure that may be a bit derivative of &quot;Sphere&quot; or an undersea &quot;Planet Of the Apes&quot;, but is not too bad for all that. You gotta give the guy credit for taking the broken record off the turntable. A group of marine scientists right out of early Cussler by way of Verne discovers a human civilization below the ocean floor that is more evolved than the one we live in. Now they're stuck: &quot;We wanna go home&quot;--&quot;But you can't. We can't afford to let our secret get out.&quot; In my opinion, though, the only really big flaw in this book is the way Cook depicts the two divers who are former Navy enlisted men--vulgar, immature, mean-spirited. Both men are cut from the same mold. It smacks of the standard bourgeois prejudice against &quot;the Great Unwashed&quot;. As a blue collar type who gets dirt under my fingernails myself, I have to wonder if Cook is really that much of an elitist. I've been entertained by his work for a whole heap o' years--now I'm thinking that I'm lucky not to know him personally.	2000-12-09

I've never been entirely happy with the Excalibur series--maybe all the books being by the same author made it creatively inbred or something. But now with the Ramboesque Calhoun gone and the ship blown up, we get the chance to see the crewmembers as individuals rather than unmatched parts in a clattering machine--they tended to spend more time interacting badly with one another like kids in the backseat on a long trip than functioning as the &quot;home team&quot; in each previous story. This book brings out the best in some of the &quot;segments&quot; of the now-scattered crew. Like the nerdy McHenry and the stolid Zak Kebron functioning as an interstellar Simon &amp; Simon team, their differences causing bickering but paradoxically making them add up to more than the sum of their parts. We see Soleta, a not always logical Vulcan, as a &quot;daddy's girl&quot; to an almost human extent, while her father steps outside his own Vulcan sternness enough to cherish her as the person she really is rather than what conventions dictate than she &quot;should be&quot;. With her warmth, plus her gift for understated irony, this lady has a personality to die for. Our old friend Q even shows up in a cameo role toward the end, and you'll notice in one of his lectures a similarity to what God told Job in the Bible. I'm almost hoping this bunch never gets back together on a single ship again--finally, after several books, the dysfunctional Excalibur shipmates are starting to get interesting.	2000-10-21

Her brilliant but troubled niece Lucy (also an FBI agent) was the one who blew away the guy's killer. Which puts her on a Charles Bronson trip where her partner gets shot. Scarpetta's irascible Sipowicz-clone detective friend Marino has gotten on the wrong side of his new deputy chief (an arrogant beauty with the soul of &quot;Homicide's&quot; Colonel Barnfather) and gotten himself &quot;flopped back in the bag&quot; (police parlance for punitive return to uniformed duty). And if that's not bad enough, Scarpetta's latest homicide case has been found in a container-ship module wearing the epitaph &quot;bye-bye werewolf&quot; in French. Earlier books in the Scarpetta series hint at a somewhat dysfunctional off-the-job life, but I've always seen her as successfully rising above them. In this book, several problems seem to be coming to a head at once, leaving Scarpetta to expend nearly as much effort combatting that side of her life as she spends on her cases. It strikes me that Cornwell is trying to do a Scott Turow noir/ psych number here, and I see this as a none-too-welcome departure from a formula that's worked for her and her heroine in the past.	2000-10-11

But not when you get this far back, gang. In those days, a Robbins book had a story--one you could sink your teeth into. And this one is one of the best. Nothing depresses me more than a book where the protagonist is the least disgusting of a number of slimeballs, and Robbins makes you like this one. Robbins was always best at stories that covered most of his main character's life. &quot;Adventurers&quot; is the epic story of the rise of a Latin American generalissimo from an embattled childhood through a playboy young manhood to the rule of his country. It's a great story, but one word of warning--Robbins has slight deficiencies in portraying nationalities not his own. In the early stages of the story when it's largely set in rural areas of the ficticious South American nation &quot;Corteguay&quot;, characters tend to sound like a cross between Speedy Gonzales and Baba Looey. Dax's caretaker/ mentor Gato Gordo (&quot;Fat Cat&quot;), before he was played by Ernest Borgnine in the movie, made me think of the comical Sergeant Garcia from the Disney Zorro series. You almost expect policemen to declare that they don't need no steenkin' badges. In my opinion, once you tune that out, you've got a story on your hands of a magnitude that Robbins himself can't seem to manage anymore.	2000-10-09

Good thing he scrapped that idea and tackled it himself, though--only Bob Rimmer can do a Bob Rimmer book. I've yet to see anyone else deal with zero-hangup sex without coming across like soft core porn. We might have wound up with &quot;Candy--The Next Generation&quot;. On the cover is a statement that it's a sequel to \\"The Harrad Experiment\\" and \\"The Premar Experiments\\". This book is more like \\"Harrad\\" in the way it deals with sponsored co-ed rooming arrangements in the college environment-\\"Premar\\" applied similar concepts to the nonacademic world. Rimmer has been accused of \\"social engineering\\" any number of times, and I've yet to read any specific denials in any of his prefaces or forewords. He does, however, avoid falling into the trap of fixating on issues that any given era's Americans might dismiss as clich&eacute;. For example, the early-70s \\"Premar\\" very pointedly focused on race as one of its primary issues (We see several characters from \\"Premar\\" here, now middle-aged and in counselor and faculty roles). Nowadays, though, there is a certain impatience with the ethnic issue in society (which saddens me, but how do I know I'm not just being a `60s dinosaur?), so Rimmer focuses more on intellectual disparity: C-average students rooming with straight-A types. The gulf between \\"collegiate\\" and \\"shop major\\" as a profound social issue is a new one on me--like most people, I'd always dismissed it as a \\"kid thing\\" even as a kid. We knew it had limited validity outside school-but when in Rome, do as the...er...Romulans do. Which side discriminated more against the other depended on where you stood. Rimmer's touched this base before, though--in \\"Love Me Tomorrow\\" with its futuristic Eloi-versus-Morlock relationship between the learned and the \\"grunts\\". The issue of women in traditionally male-dominated sports is addressed here, along with a play-by-play account of a co-ed basketball game. Other than that, we've seen a lot of this before-a rich girl from a dysfunctional family, a former school nerd who's going to be a doctor, the cops busting in at the end of the game and slapping the cuffs on everybody in sight for lewd and lascivious behavior, yadda-yadda. I guess the secret of appreciating this book is that a number of fresh issues--intellectual disparity being but one-are addressed here. One thing that made me go \\"say WHAT\\", though, was that one of the students is named--I kid you not--Jorge Jefferson. Maybe this dates me, but the song started running through my head--\\"Well we're movin' on up, to the east side...\\". Despite the fact that the Spanish name doesn't sound a bit like its English counterpart, I kept waiting for him to nickname his roommate \\"Weezie\\".f this before-a rich girl from a dysfunctional family, a former school nerd who's going to be a doctor, the cops busting in at the end of the game and slapping the cuffs on everybody in sight for lewd and lascivious behavior, yadda-yadda.

The &quot;New Earth&quot; series was bogging down over the course of six books, but this book brings just about everything so far to a head. Maybe this was just too long a series for the story idea involved--it was a big one, but maybe not this big. But in this book, Billy Maidenshore-a rogue who makes Harry Mudd pale by comparison (he's more like a composite of Angus Thermopyle and Nick Succorso from Stephen Donaldson's &quot;Gap&quot; series)-pushes the envelope a bit too far and discovers the hard way that Uhura is no one to be trifled with. There's the young first officer of a ship whose captain's instability gets the vessel destroyed, but team him with Scotty, plus an alien POW, and he reminds you of Kirk when he was that age. But Kirk never accomplished the scratch-building of a warship from salvaged parts, even with the redoubtable Scotsman. There's the conflict of the Blood and the Kauld, who have been at war so long that it's practically a secular religion to both cultures. The appearance through the course of the series of the Federation people, who don't seem to think it's important to wipe out other cultures as the only way to survive, has always puzzled the combatants-until both sides need the Feds to help them against a new enemy. Kin yew say &quot;common cause&quot;? I knew yew could. The Belle Terre colonists themselves transcend their xenophobia and their total absorption in their own problems to help the &quot;captain because he needed to be&quot; build his makeshift vessel. If this series could have been cut down to a trilogy, all three volumes could have been as strong as this one.	2000-09-28

She's Stella Marz, the D.A. who prosecuted Tony Lord's client/ boyhood  buddy in &quot;No Safe Place&quot;. But now Patterson has done a Scott  Turow number, taking our attention out of the courtroom and focusing it on  the raw psyches of our cast of characters. Not to mention giving a  supporting character in a previous book the lead role in a new book. Like  Marz, who's investigating the bizarre murder of her old flame in a  dysfunctional romance. As you'd expect, colleagues are advising her not to  handle this one because she probably can't maintain the detatchment she  needs. As the story wears on, we can't help but think she should have  listened. She's sleeping lousy and having bad dreams. She's getting  threatening phone calls to back off. She sees real and/ or imaginary  stalkers in nondescript cars. Her apartment's getting broken into. There's  also a Grisham-like element here where corruption surrounding a new stadium  project involves Marz's old boyfriend, organized crime, and even her  crusading boss. Peripherally, Marz starts to get sweet on one of the cops  who works for her, builds a rapport with his little daughter that seems  like it's just as meaningful as the emerging relationship with Daddy--then  she finds out that Daddy plays a small role in the stadium corruption  scheme. Myself, I liked Patterson when he was still Patterson handling  basic crime with maybe an odd aspect to it--not a Turow clone who  psychoanalyzes his cast of characters or a Grisham clone who does a  quasi-tabloid/ quasi-fiction number on sticky fingers in high rise offices.	2000-09-18

As in &quot;Eiger&quot;, there are people  getting whacked left-and-right despite the fact that a mountain climb in  the Himalayas is enough risk as it is. While Bond is looking for valuable  defense files stolen from Her Majesty's govenment and then lost when the  thieves' plane crashes on the mountain, the thieves have an inside man in  Bond's team. Not content with that, there are competing teams as well. One  interesting character is a Ghurka soldier working with Bond who turns out  to be one of the best right-hand-men 007 has had since Dr. No's Quarrel.  This man is a very personable, philosophical sort of guy. Apparently Benson  has done some research here on Nepalese and Ghurka folkways. Unfortunately,  the bad guys (known as &quot;The Union&quot;) are a SPECTRE ripoff--they  don't have much new to offer as an adversary. Except for the features on  Bond's car (only featured in the opening chapters and already here from a  previous book anyway), the gadgetry here is more subtle--personal devices  aimed more towards convenience for the user than gee-whiz flash--I wouldn't  be surprised if some of that stuff actually exists. The films have always  been a bit too gear-happy, and Benson successfully resists overdoing that  in his books.	2000-09-01

Give Cosby's first half-dozen standup albums a listen, and you will find that the theme of childhood predominates his work. But while Cosby's  stories of his own childhood make a fun time out of his urban upbringing,  King reminds us what a chamber of horrors childhood can be. Those of us who  shake our heads at how our kids make a big deal out of  &quot;meaningless&quot; things forget how very real such things were to us  at that age. This is what makes this book a worthy successor to  &quot;It&quot;. What we get here is a set of stories that are so related to  one another that King could have claimed they were &quot;Book I&quot;,  &quot;Book II&quot;, etc. of the same novel. The common denominator here is  a girl named Carol, but the two novellas are not from her perspective--but  from the perspectives of two guys involved with her at different points of  her life. There's a mysterious elderly stranger who's on the run from  agents of a mysterious enemy called the &quot;Crimson King&quot; (I find  myself wondering if that's some myth separate from this story--the early  progressive band King Crimson seem to derive their name from it, as well as  the tile of their first album &quot;In the Court Of the Crimson  King&quot;). There's also a semi-allusion to the movie &quot;Storm Of the  Century&quot; where a character says the same thing at one point that  &quot;Storm's&quot; main character keeps saying throughout the movie:  &quot;Give me what I want and I'll go away&quot; (I still wish King had  made that one into a book). But although there are mysterious demons here  like in King's other books, our heroes suffer just as much at the hands of  other mortals. Like three ordinary bullies beating on Carol with a baseball  bat, dislocating her shoulder, for instance. Cosby's lesson is that no  matter how tough your childhood was, your buddies were pretty funny. King,  however, reminds us of childhood peers that we did well not to turn our  backs on. Well, Nietsche put the same point about as well: &quot;I find  that I owe more to the hard times of my life than I could ever owe to the  easier times.&quot;he same point about as well: &quot;I find  that I owe more to the hard times of my life than I could ever owe to the  easier times.&quot;	2000-08-16

One big feature about this book is that  the hostility between Bond and M has faded quite a bit. She actually calls  him James a few times. Oh, yeah--about the allusion above. Remember that  scene in &quot;Wizard Of Oz&quot; where the horse pulling the carriage in  the Emerald City keeps changing color? They explain to Dorothy that this is  the famous &quot;horse of a different color&quot;. Well, Bond's new Jag  does the same thing--with the flip of a switch. Beats the Aston Martin he  had in Goldfinger--the one with the changing plates.	2000-08-01

Women. Four of them, plus the men in their lives. College roomates  Amanda and Gillian, a study in opposites. Amanda is beautiful and feminine  but a bit prissy, but this hides a deeply sensual nature. Gillian is earthy  and sexy, but more naiive than she'll admit. Julia is a community  &quot;pillar&quot; of this college town who refuses to bow to age. Kate is  Amanda's niece, raised as a daughter. Maybe this is why this woman-child is  mature beyond her years. Matthew, a Rhett Butler-style Southern Lothario  whose heart, like Rhett's,  is tamed by a &quot;conquest&quot;. And David,  Julia's son--just out of the stockade after an incident while in the Navy,  he's brilliant and understandably troubled. He follows up his military  failure with a successful civilian career--except when it comes to finding  Miss Right.	2000-07-22

A peasant woman is tasked  to re-raise this man from pretty much a second infancy. But now things are  starting to come back, and the supervisor, although a native himself, sees  the threat this poses to his masters' power. The principal crop on this  world is a form of cotton that grows only this way on his planet--it's used  in expensive clothing. But before his mind was &quot;wiped&quot;, the  victim was a scientist who had discovered a menace which threatened that  planet. Although the story has Ludlumesque head games by people in power,  its strong point is in the human factor in the form of the victim, his  female protector, as well as his former boss who's concerned about what  became of him. That's why I say Wouk. But this is a sci fi book, right?  Well, don't let that scare you off. It's a hell of a story in a middlin'  size book--you don't get the two in a single package all that often.	2000-07-18

It deals with Earth having to fight a protracted interstellar war with a humanoid civilization in the Sirian system. Something has to be done to  break this near-stalemate, so ne'er-do-well James Mowry gets drafted  because he is smaller than the average human and speaks fluent Sirian. The  idea is that Mowry do some sabotage and psychological warfare on a Sirian  planet. Mowry is really no urbane Bond type--he hangs out in urban areas  with a bunch of Bogart/ Cagney hood types--but he manages to use this bunch  of hard cases who don't give a damn about patriotism one way or the other  as muscle. It's too bad this book is out of print--I've had my Dell edition  for almost 40 years.	2000-07-17

Reviewers of Flynn's previous work &quot;Term Limits&quot; compared Flynn  to Tom Clancy and I just couldn't see it. That book was as much manifesto  as story, its antihero a disgruntled Congressman who no longer believed in  the institution he was elected to serve. This book, however, has an actual  hero in the form of CIA agent/ commando Mitch Rapp. His boss Dr. Irene  Kennedy is familiar to those of us who read &quot;Limits&quot;--throughout  that book, she seemed more the hero than the good Congressman. I guess  that's because she actually &quot;fought the fight&quot; instead of  grinding personal axes the way the Congressman did in that book. We get an  attack-and-siege scene in the White House that I bet Steven Seagall might  wish that he'd waited for. All in all, a good yarn that I frankly didn't  expect from the guy who wrote &quot;Under Siege&quot;. I don't know why I  gave Flynn a second chance, but I'm glad I did.

This is a SCREENPLAY, and I'm not into screenplays. I just  can't get into a story that's all he said--she said. So maybe I'm being  unfair with the 3 lousy stars when I should have done more research before  I bought--&quot;...an educated consumer...&quot; yadda-yadda.

Maybe  Anderson should write one--if he does, he can guarantee selling a copy to  me. It's a great story.	2000-07-07

I'm sure a lot of us already are taking it for granted that Han and Leia's kids are the heirs apparent, so it's all too easy to ignore the &quot;tweener&quot; generation Stackpole has been  introducing us to for several of his &quot;X-Wing&quot; books. As such, the  &quot;New Jedi Order&quot; shows us that in no uncertain terms. In this  book, as well as its predecessor &quot;Onslaught&quot;, we see that the  Solo kids have plenty of &quot;elder siblings&quot; to look to--the best of  them in my opinion being Corran Horn and his wife Mirax Terrik. Horn, in  the manner of Master Luke, found his Jedi identity relatively late in life  during his service as an X-Wing pilot after having been a cop on his native  Corellia. It goes to show you that Yoda's objection to Kenobi that Luke was  too old to train properly was quite wrong. We also get in this series a  whole new type of enemy who've built a jihad-based religion on a hatred of  machines. Sort of makes the Empire seem benign by comparison, huh? As a  matter of fact, both cultures form a military treaty to present a common  front against them--despite the enmity, they've always respected each  other's abilities as warriors. After all, didn't most of us in our universe  think when the original Star Wars came out that the Soviets and the West  would remain bitter enemies forever?	2000-07-06

The  brutality of the guards at the reformatory is an issue that should be  addressed, if only for the fact that hardened criminals often begin the  &quot;hardening&quot; in just that way. But Carcaterra ain't no hood no  more, he's a respected writer. The bitterness underlying this grueling tale  is uncharacteristic for a successful man who has overcome quite a lot to  get where he is.	2000-06-27

Back then, sci fi  was more or less interstellar horse opera--&quot;Wagon Train To the  Stars&quot; was a working nickname for Trek in its formative state. Trek  TOS fiction has been mainly good guy/ bad guy, unlike its successor forms.  But this series of books is among the best in the TOS universe when it  comes to fleshing out Jim Kirk as a person, which is a lot easier to  imagine about Picard and Sisko. And unlike in the sci fi of old, friends  and allies don't always get along. Kirk is not only in the middle of a uber  alles conflict between two alien races due to the fact that he and his  charges happen to be passing through--he's getting just as much grief from  anti-Starfleet types among the people he's on this mission to protect. It's  easy to relate to that nowadays when it's trendy to hate your government,  when the most obscene four-letter word is &quot;GOVT&quot;. Herman Wouk  this ain't, but I'm going to be very interested to see how this shakes out  in the final reel.	2000-06-23

Christina North is a porn queen who oddly enough wrote the book her movie was based on. The last meaningful love relationship she had was with a college sweetheart who was  the son of a Louisiana televangelist--since then it's been a case of that  old country song; &quot;Lookin' for love in all the wrong places&quot;. She  marries a rich guy and the marriage is unfulfilling. So she tries an  alternative to suicide--suspended animation for 15 years. The &quot;new  era&quot; she wakes up in isn't really much better--there's a sharp  devision between the &quot;lecks&quot; (intellectuals) and the  &quot;iks&quot; (mean-spirited non or anti intellectuals some of whom are  rich and some poor) . It reminds me of H.G Wells' Eloi and Morlocks from  &quot;The Time Machine&quot; in the way it's this us-and-them scenario with  neither group really admitting the other are really &quot;people&quot;, as  such. On reflection, my reaction was the same as with the Wells  book--&quot;If that's the future, you can have my share of it and welcome  to it&quot;.	2000-06-05

If not for Pitt's longtime mutually respectful relationship with a Congresswoman, I'd  suspect him as being a bit of a misogynist. Austin is more accessible--you  don't think &quot;superman&quot; as you read about him. Plus, his partner  Jose Zavala is a not particularly caricature Hispanic-American--when Bill  Shatner gave his &quot;Tek&quot; series hero a Latino partner, the reader  practically wound up getting Baba Looey in human form. The story here is  sort of cautionary--a rich malcontent trying to set up a breakaway republic  and not particularly caring how he goes about it. That's a bit reminscent  of part of John Jakes' &quot;North &amp; South&quot; trilogy, when a  radical rich Confederate tries to set up a breakaway Confederacy from the  original one. I feel that this raises a point about the trendy  anti-government mania nowadays--it's best not to forget what Pandora's  boxes that particular fad might be opening.	2000-05-23

In the past, Coonts has focused almost entirely on the main characters--Grafton, Toad, Rita (Mrs. Toad), et al--while Clancy has always been good at &quot;bit players. This book has  heavy emphasis on minor character &quot;El Ocho&quot;, a ballplayer whose  manager has talked him into emulating the Marielitas so that he can  ultimately emulate El Duque. Despite the fact El Ocho is realistic about  his talents as compared to the big leaguers. The scenes at sea aboard the  usual unsafe boat are extremely grueling. The only problem is that Coonts  has decided to also emulate Clive Cussler in drafting Fidel Castro into the  cast. Cussler has his hero Dirk Pitt saving Fidel from a coup--here, Coonts  has him dying of cancer, with evil opportunists angling to become his  replacement. In my opinion, when authors do this sort of thing, they reveal  more about their ideology than they do their talent as storytellers. The  job of the author of fiction is to provide the reader with fantasy, not  indulge his own wishful thinking. Fidel may constitute a rather negative  reality, but he is a reality nonetheless.	2000-05-15

This story is apparently an &quot;autobiography&quot; of DS9 tailor/ spy Garak compiled of journal entries of his ruminations on the upcoming reinvasion of his home planet, interspersed with memories of his military  school experiences. Cardassian academies, I'll have you know, are a lot  tougher than West Point or The Citadel, as you'll discover in this story.  Their &quot;lords of discipline&quot; are what turn out hard cases like  Dukat and Damar. And it's also why Garak, despite his seeming effeteness,  is a pretty tough customer himself at times. I don't know if Robinson, who  played Garak on the series, really is the author, or if he did a Bill  Shatner and had it ghosted. All I know is if you can get past the  temptation to be a purist, this book is worth the read. No matter who  &quot;wrote&quot; it.	2000-05-10

But I've  always seen Mr. Spock as the &quot;lone wolf&quot; type, even during Nurse  (later Doctor) Chapel's semirequited crush on him (semirequited because he  was fond of her--just not in the way she wanted). In this story, though,  the couple are hampered by biology, so the real heroes of this story are a  moderate Romulan bureaucrat and his like-minded subordinates. After all, if  a revolution is ever to succeed, it has to be done by &quot;home  folks&quot;--foreign assistance is just that: assistance. We also get to  see the Stargazer-era Picard in action, as well as a Romulan's eye view of  the attack on the Klingon science outpost that nobody in this story knows  orphaned a little tyke named Worf.	2000-05-09

When it first came out, it was a must-read for all of us twentysomethings who came of age during or at least near the Summer Of Love. As a kid who wore my heart on my sleeve at that age, I fit the demographic perfectly.  What you have here is a pretty decent coming-of-age story which also  suggested to us that the WW II generation, who at the time were saw us as  only useful as cannon fodder in 'Nam, really had hearts and actually used  them when they were our age. Here we have Hermie, a teenager who falls for  a pretty neighbor whose boyfriend is in the service. One of his buddies is  into swaggering schoolboy macho and provides no understanding whatever (as  an undergrad, I had a dorm suite-mate who looked, talked and acted exactly  like Oscy). Hermie's other friend, Benjy, is caught between the two but  he's one of those kids who's good at maintaining a low profile. The trouble  is, you either have to be young and romantic to relate to this story, or at  least have a mental time-warp connection to when you were that way. Hey,  when it came out it brought tears to my eyes. Nowadays, it leaves me cold.  What can I say? I can't relate to Howdy Doody anymore either.	2000-05-02

Another feature is Jake Sisko's opportunity to play a  real adult role rather than Ben's kid. Odo is just, well...Odo. The type of  dude you can always count on. I'm not going to give away any more of the  story--with a tale this big, you can give the ending away a lot earlier  than with just one book. But here's a warning--you can't just buy this book  and come away satisfied--you gotta get the other two. Hell, buy all three  at once, it's worth the 16 bucks and will save you on shipping.

Winn would roll over in her grave, if it  weren't for the fact that, all in all, they'd have made a pretty good  couple. The sheer volume of sanctimony the pair would be capable would  reach all the way to the Gamma Quadrant. But we also get here Mr. &amp;  Mrs. Worf as a warrior couple beyond compare (but I found myself saying  &quot;Huh? I thought Dukat whacked Jadzia.&quot;). Not to mention Nog as a  veteran middle-aged captain who has more than justified Ben Sisko's support  getting him into the Academy. It occurred to me years ago, though,  that he  could call into a radio station and dedicate an old 20th century Earth pop  classic by War to his old friend Jake: &quot;The Sisko kid, he was a friend  of mine&quot;. But seriously, if you only buy this book, you'll be missing  a lot of story fore-and-aft. No one volume of this trilogy is meant to be  read as a story in and of itself any more than any one volume of &quot;Lord  Of the Rings&quot;. I'm not comparing this saga to that, mind you. But it  stands head-and-shoulders over the usual run of Trek novel. Those of you  who dismiss Trek fiction as lightweight, be advised. The Reeves-Stevens  team have given us a tale that can't be written off that easily. Give it a  try--it'll be worth the sixteen bucks (if you buy all three volumes here)  it costs.	2000-03-28

We get all the best characters and they're at their best here. Worf (my favorite character in all the Treks), a human-raised Klingon who's as tough as any, but unlike  the Klingons Kirk had to face, is a heluva decent guy. He could intimidate  subordinates but he chooses to inspire them and support them. Until Ben  Sisko, I thought no one would ever match Picard for dignity. We also see  what kind of officer Nog will turn out to be--a support to an aging Picard.  It's really ironic how Sisko though he'd be a bad influence on son Jake  when they were kids, but he never considered the other side of the  coin--how Jake would be a positive influence on Nog (Quark: &quot;You're  beginning to think like a hew-mon!&quot;). This is the kind of saga the  Reeves-Stevenses would normally do outside the Trek universe, but they  chose to put it here. Here's a warning, though. Neither this book (nor its  two following volumes) can be read as complete stories--there are  cliff-hanger endings on the first two. So you've got to get them all.  That's okay--it'll be worth it.

But you know, when I bought &quot;Nimitz Class&quot; because the concept almost intrigued me, after the first read, it almost wound up getting contributed to my  church's book sale table. Speaking as a Tom Clancy fan, Robinson was an  acquired taste. To compare him to Clancy is a mistake--Robinson  concentrates heavily on ships, where Clancy only did one book which spent  that much time on the water: &quot;Red October&quot;. If you picture  somebody who falls between him and Clive Cussler, you've got Patrick  Robinson. Where he's like Clancy is that his characters are plain ole  life-size, not Homeric like Cussler's Dirk Pitt. The only problem I see is  that his American characters aren't always that convincing. In &quot;Kilo  Class&quot;, he had a Yank using a Brit vulgarism my countrymen would never  do unless we were doing a Michael Caine impression. But don't let that stop  you from buying this book--in the same way the Colonel does chicken well,  Robinson does Navy well.	2000-03-20

Luke's not the only married Jedi--Corran  Horn of Stackpole's X-Wing series was already hitched but he's been through  Luke's Academy. We also have Bothan extremist Borsk Feyl'ya as the current  Republic head of. Last I knew, he was the &quot;galaxy far away's&quot;  equivalent to Pat Buchanan--all bluster, xenophobia and conspiracy  theories. You see, the Republic is now nonhuman-run and the element who  blames the human race in its entirety for the Empire (Emperor Palpatine,  Darth Vader and all) is in the forefront. Jedi Knights have become a  mistrusted &quot;special interest group&quot;.

Succeeding volumes have tightened up the story and brough into more importance  characters and mini-plots that seemed to be more in the way of digressions  when alluded to in the first book. The aliens have computer technology,  while the closest most Earthmen can even come to the word  &quot;computer&quot; is the word &quot;calculator&quot;. There's laser  technology, and with it comes CD-roms and DVDs. They have cruise missiles  which can fly down a street and go around a corner to hit a specific  building when we, half a century later, haven't gotten quite that far with  such missiles. But the big lessons here are that it's a big mistake for a  superpower to assume too much about their scentific superiority and its  ability to prevail no matter what. The &quot;what&quot; in this case is  guerilla warfare--it works. Period. In the real world, both my country and  the Soviet Union learned that the hard way--us in Vietnam and the Soviets  in Afghanistan. And in this story, it's how us primitives on Earth make  what was supposed to have been a walkover invasion by the aliens a long  drawn-out agony. They end up having to make choices and concessions. Like  keeping a human baby as an experimental subject when her Chinese mother  joins Chairman Mao's revolution and they ain't gonna cool it unless she  gets the kid back. So the military types tell the science wonks that  keeping the kid ain't worth the grief. That's how guerilla warfare works  the best--as time goes on, the invader finds it less and less worth it to  hang on as a matter of ego.

And he's like his daughter in the way he's too serious for his age. We also meet &quot;old Ben&quot; as a sometimes impatient young guy who needs the  steadying influence of experience. I even had one question answered that it  never occurred to me to ask--how old is See Threepio? One thing I don't  get, though, is all the uproar about Jar Jar Binks--how he's supposedly a  negative caricature of African Americans. First off, he isn't human of any  race--he's of amphibian stock. His mannerisms remind me of the character  Gollum from &quot;Lord Of the Rings, except with a lot less attitude. The  nearest Earth equivalent to his speech strikes me as being Carribean, but  all of his people talk that way. Evidently it's the syntax of their native  tongue applied to an English vocabulary. If his people are supposed to be  so unevolved, how come they make a pretty neat light submarine? I guess I'm  going to have to wait until I get the flick--until then, maybe I'm just  clueless on the issue.	2000-03-09

Ironically, the stuff has some medical benefit when a member of an alien tank crew gives his wounded commander part of his personal stash as a stimulant so he'll  make it as far as the nearest field hospital. A disaffected ship's captain  leads an unsuccessful mutiny against the fleet admiral and ends up turning  himself over to the Earth authorities to evade arrest. Earth technology  evolves too fast for the aliens to keep track of--they remain centuries  ahead of us but the pure fact that we keep making improvements keeps them  off balance. And it's not like we're advancing in everything--the uneasy  alliances among Earth nations remain uneasy due to nationalism in the  ranks. The big victories here are all one-person ones. Like a Chinese woman  who was mated to an American man by the aliens as an experiment. In the  previous book, she loses the guy in a raid. Now the alien scientists take  her baby away from her. So she joins communist guerillas to get even. After  all, in her country, the Reds are the ones doing the real fighting back.  But an Earth scientist whose wife marries someone else while he's MIA  continues to get more and more bitter about it. More and more each day, he  flirts with the idea of defecting to the aliens to get even (I think the  Harold Lauder character from Stephen King's &quot;The Stand&quot; might be  an influence here). This series continues to get more and more interesting  after a fairly weak start in the first volume.	2000-03-06

It wasn't until I got into this book that I began to realize that the first volume (&quot;In The Balance&quot;) was a package of preludes rather than a story in itself. This one has some delicious concepts. Such as a  woman who remarries when her husband is missing and presumed dead. Only to  have her ex show up alive and well. The lizard invaders have a  weakness--ginger is a drug which gets them high and is addictive  (&quot;don't bogart those ginger snaps, my friend...pass 'em over to  me&quot;). Winston Churchill makes a tour of inspection of military  readiness on a bicycle. A minor-league baseball manager utilizes his  civilian skills when he becomes a sergeant. One of his ballplayers, along  with a Chinese woman, becomes an experimental animal so that the invaders  can study human mating. The couple end up proving that not speaking each  other's language and not having chosen each other in the first place are  not necessarily obstacles to love. FDR has to deliver his &quot;fireside  chats&quot; from &quot;somewhere in America&quot;, because the country is  as much a battleground as anywhere overseas. I still think &quot;Guns Of  the South&quot; is Turtledove's masterpiece, but this 4 volume set is still  worth the read.	2000-02-25

The last time he did a &quot;person in non-supernatural trouble&quot; was &quot;Gerald's Game&quot;. The less said about that one, the better. But in one of King's  anthologies, he even plays the sportswriter for one of his son's little  league ballgames, referring to the kid by his last name like any other  player. In this book, he takes on the story of a little girl who's a Red  Sox fan and how she gets lost in the woods. This one (would you believe?)  could hit the screen as an afterschool special, because there's so little  adult language that it could be edited without eviscerating the story. The  book itself (would you again believe?) could be put in the YA section of  most libraries. So much for Stephen King as a one-dimensional author, huh?	2000-02-18

I'm waiting for Turtledove to expand this series to World War II and beyond. So far, the only way he's done that is in the sci-fi based &quot;Worldwar&quot; series--I'd prefer an &quot;us Earthlings only&quot;  approach. This book gives those who are far too used to Amerca as a  superpower an opportunity to realize that events leading up to World War I  would have happened even had there been no Western Hemisphere. And I tend  to wonder whether Custer was really all that obsessed with the Mormons. One  thing I find disquieting, though--literate Afro-Confederates reading the  socialist theories of Marx and Lincoln (? ) and seeing in it the potential  for a race war. Especially since all through the Civil Rights 'Sixties,  Klan publications were calling the drive for racial justice &quot;the  influence of godless communists&quot;. It's a bit depressing to think that  the Red Tar Brush might be there for racists to apply to any move towards  racial parity.	2000-02-14

Engineer Reg Barclay has always reminded me of the character Theodore Honey in Nevil Shute's &quot;No Highway&quot; (Honey was played by Jimmy Stewart in the movie). He's always been tentative and socially inept, but  he wouldn't be an engineer on a major starship if he wasn't competent  there. So, as with Honey in the Shute novel, once Barclay has to face a  situation where he's good at what's invoved, he's going to score a victory.  The story involves a crystalline world protected by a force shield. The  engineering involving the &quot;shell&quot; has over the centuries evolved  into a religion, but the shell is in danger due to a stellar anomaly a bit  like a black hole, and all the dogma surrounding the religion/ techology  isn't helping matters one bit. So Barclay ends up on the away team,  accompanied by a female crewmember who's from that world. Here's a  hint--after Barclay's long-standing unrequited crush on Counselor Troi, he  becomes a big hit with this lady. After all, he's the hero, and the hero  gets the girl. The story continues in the other book in this pair,  &quot;Gemworld Book 2&quot;. If you're going to get this one, you have to  get the other--it takes both to tell the story.	2000-02-03

I can see this as one of those zany Billy Crystal movies--were it not for the fact that Billy as Gerald would croak in the first scene. Reality check--time out! It this story, Gerald and Jessie go to their cabin out in  the wilderness, where Gerald decides to &quot;enhance&quot; their  lovemaking with a mild bondage trick. He binds her wrists and ankles to the  bedposts--and breaks his fool neck! Literally. The rest of the story puts  Jessie in the position of a woodchuck caught in a trap. She's got a husband  dead on the floor nearby, but not another soul within miles to help. It  might have made a so-so short story in one of King's anthologies. Then  again, his editors might have tried to talk him out of it. Whatever the  case, it ain't no novel. And it ain't much of a story.	2000-02-01

Which is to say, not enough Trek short stories, just full-length novels. It gives more opportunity for a specialized story. Like a Mr. Data story. A Cyrano Jones sequel. What goes through Captain Pike's mind as an invalid. A  story where Reg Barclay gets to be a hero rather than just swept along by  events. A rite of passage for Cadet Nog. Lots of intriguing stuff like  that. These stories may be by amateurs, but there's not a thing amateurish  about them. This is the first of three such anthologies, and they're asking  for contributors for a fourth. Here's a hint, all of you pro Trek writers.  Don't leave it entirely up to us fans to come up with stuff like this. The  very first Star Trek print fiction was when the late James Blish did  adaptations of the Original Series episodes.

He struck me as a not very personable guy--he seemed bored as hell with the whole gig. But my copy of his first &quot;Thomas Covenant&quot; trilogy still has his signature. But...on to the main topic. This book and its four  sequels depict man's spacefaring future the way the &quot;X Files&quot;  depicts the near-future FBI. There's nothing in this series suggestive of  man's outgrowing his present-day character flaws like you'd find in  Heinlein, Asimov, Star Wars or Star Trek. Instead, you find the galaxy  under the thumb of a huge mining company and its tame police. To paraphase  the old Tennessee Ernie Ford song, humanity in this series owes more than  it's soul &quot;to the company sto'&quot;.There are no heroes here--the  best you get to oppose the bad guys are these dysfunctional cases. Like a  young policewoman who'd be a great hero by virtue of her sense of right and  wrong were it not for the fact that she spends most of the time getting  victimized. Even her bosses hang her out to dry. I tell you, if they ever  make a movie of any of this series, Lifetime will have as much of a claim  on broadcast rights as the Sci Fi Channel..  But you know, now i think I  understand Donaldson better. He's a bona fide iconoclast--maybe he finds  ordinary sci fi too goody-goody. This is one very gifted writer, but from  him you don't get &quot;The Jetsons&quot;. More like what if Nietzsche  wrote fiction.	2000-01-05

When Joe Wambaugh started playing it for laughs, he lost me as a reader. There's a section where our hero is on her cell phone and a garbled crossover from someone else's call makes her think a hate  crime is being planned, when actually it's just a couple of hunters making  plans. Not only that, one of these guys has an embarrassing name that's  been passed down through several generations (you'd think one of his  ancestors would have gotten the point a long time ago). All the bad jokes  make the story line disjointed and muddled. The only redeeming factor here  is that the main character is pure Cornwell--a strong female character who  concentrates on her profession rather than gender politics. Chief Judy  Hammer is a brass level cop who's so competent that she was brought in from  the outside to straighten out a dysfunctional police force. Kind of like  Cornwell's main hero Kay Scarpetta from most of her other books, an M.E.  who's good enough to run a whole state's forensic pathology unit. I only  hope this book isn't &quot;The New Cornwell&quot;, where she ends up  casting Scarpetta in stories that are a mix of &quot;Diagnosis:  Murder&quot; and &quot;Police Academy&quot;. I enjoy non sequitur humor as  much as anyone else, but I began reading Cornwell's stuff for the same  reason I read Wambaugh a generation ago--to get good crime stories.	1999-12-14

This one's definitely the tail-end charlie of the three &quot;Homicide&quot; books, in  more than just chronology. Plus, I think Preisler didn't take enough care  here with the cops on the case. He has Munch as pretentious and  condescending here as he is in the new &quot;Law &amp; Order: Special  Crimes Unit&quot; series, when he isn't really quite that bad in the  &quot;Homicide&quot; series overall. Plus, he continues to depict Giardello  as a looming, thunderous presence--I've always read the guy as avuncular.  And in this book, he tends to exaggerate street slang by black characters  to the extent to where it might alienate a balck reader. He even has Lewis  saying &quot;hey, yo, whassup?&quot; to Kellerman in one scene, when the  guy is several years too old for that vintage of slang.	1999-12-08

It's the story of nerdy scientist Theodore Honey (the British term of that time was &#34;boffin&#34;--it specifically targeted scentists) who discovers a  potentially deadly flaw in a new airliner. The problem is that nobody but  his boss Dr. Dennis Scott (from whose viewpoint this story is told) has any faith in his theory. After all, oddballs don't have very high credibility factors. Scott isn't so sure, so he sends Honey over to Canada to investigate a recent crash of one of those planes, only to have it turn out that the plane he takes is also one of that model. Which makes for a particularly gripping scene--it's  the centerpiece of the James Stewart movie based on this book. Other  important characters here are Honey's motherless daughter, an actress Honey and his late wife had been fans of who's also on the flight--he reminds her of an old friend she knew before she became famous, the plane's captain who is increasingly unsure that he can dismiss Honey as a crackpot--the captain of the doomed flight Honey is investigating had been a close friend. Plus a stewardess who not only shares her  captain's point of view--but finds Honey strangely compelling in an even more important way. Nowadays you don't often find this human a story in so  short a book. Shute's best known book is &#34;On The Beach&#34;.	1999-11-23

We learned in earlier volumes that this was scientist Kim Ward's homeland. But now, in this volume, we get a closer look at the  place--much of this book is set there. This is an &quot;underworld&quot;  with none of the romance of the Sewers Of Paris as depicted in &quot;Les  Miserables&quot;. Two hundred years of the Seven's rule have created an  underclass of people in both a social and a geographic sense, and it's  beginning to boil up into a conflagration we couldn't begin to imagine in  present-day ghettos and barrios. Meanwhile, the rule of the Seven has been  on the skids since the previous volume--the only T'ang who's still a viable  ruler may be the most decent of the original Seven, but that fact doesn't  help a bit. Arch revolutionary Howard Devore--a Stalinesque type who as a  cure for tyranny is worse than the desease--has come back from his exile on  Mars. In the words of James Baldwin, it's &quot;the fire next time&quot;,  and next time is right now.	1999-11-09

In this volume, two more forces of defiance against the Seven (a  regionalized monarchy) add their efforts to that of the terrorist sector in  previous volumes. There are the Triads of organized crime (which, like the  Mob, got their start as a political underground--I hadn't known that) and a  new semi-insurgent political party in America led by (would you believe?) a  descendant of the Kennedys. Part of that movement consists of certain  scions of corporate bigwigs, a Generation Gap scenario which makes this  century's version add up to chump change by comparison. Plus, the disunity  among the Seven grows worse, with some particularly ugly three-versus-four  backstabbing which threatens to break into open conflict. And if you think  a falling out among kings necessarily benefits the masses, think again! I  don't agree in the least with other reviwers who compare this series to  &quot;Dune&quot; or the &quot;Foundation&quot; saga--it might be  future-oriented, but it's not nearly other-worldly enough for those  comparisons. This is more about human nature as it exists on this  world--you could set it in any era and it would work. Which makes any  comparisons between Wingrove and Asimov or Herbert well wide of the mark.  Try imagining Harry Turtledove's &quot;alternate history&quot; stuff and  moving it a couple of centuries into the future.	1999-11-04

There's a scene where a  young newlywed prince--a nice guy for the most part--is worried about the  welfare of the two young maids he owned during early adolescence. So he  sends an emmisary to check on them. The two girls tell the emmisary that  they're lonely for the prince and miss him badly. You see, during the  previous volume, &quot;The Middle Kingdom&quot;, they had &quot;initiated  him into manhood&quot;, quite affectionately explaining to him;  &quot;That's what we're here for&quot;. In the process, they both fell in  love with him. Neither girl (they're sisters) is jealous of the other. They  don't even resent his new bride--the way they see it, they had both played  a part in a necessary rite of passage for the kid. In this book, he admits  to himself that the reason he cares about their welfare is that he loves  them as well. What's the best thing he can do for them? He plans to give  them their freedom, as well as a substantial dowry. They can't have him,  but they'll never be anyone's property again. That's what's so cruddy about  slavery--when master and slave care for each other as people, but all that  &quot;the system&quot; depicted in this story allows is a  &quot;semi-requited&quot; relationship. I felt so sorry for all three of  these young people. It's too much of a temptation to chalk it all up to the  alleged Oriental &quot;lower respect for human dignity&quot; and forget  that we in the West have our share of it in our history. There's a lesson  in this for HUMANITY, period. However human society &quot;advances&quot; or  &quot;regresses&quot; in our future, we damn sure don't want to go back to  something like that.	1999-10-25

That's something about this book that neither the series nor other books never show--Counselor Troi's meddlesome mom as anything else but that. You tended to get the feeling that this was one reason why Troi never married:  why would a nice girl like her want to subject the man she loved to the  Mother-In-Law From Hell? We knew she liked Worf's son Alexander--that's the  grandma in her coming out. But in this book, we find that she is capable of  realizing that it's her &quot;little one's&quot; call on who's going to be  Mr. Right. And as such, she sets out to try and understand &quot;Mr.  Woof&quot;. I almost like the old biddy in this book.	1999-10-20

Some examples are \\"Blade Runner\\" and \\"Clockwork Orange\\", whose authors  forget that not everyone has an easy time with obscure metaphor or  narrative in a vernacular spoken in a future that ain't happened yet.  That's what makes Wingove's \\"Chung Kuo\\" series fairly easy going  despite the length of each volume. But it's a good thing that cliche Sinophobes aren't space opera geeks like me. Wingrove postulates here a  Chinese domination or Earth in the late 21st century that results in a  resurgence of a Medieval life-is-dirt-cheap ethos that is sort of a  reverse-Clavell scenario. The crowd who are into this neo-Yellow Peril  hypothesis would have a field day. Wingrove's sentence structure suggests  that he's British, so maybe it's understandable that Germans come off less  villainous only by comparison here. Tycoon Hans Ebert, for example, reminds  me of the Wolf Stoller character from Wouk's \\"Winds Of War\\". It's  a shame, because this book and its following volumes are a dual rarity--an  epic saga that's not really all that much of an overdose (hey, a big story  takes a long time to tell, okay?), as well as a \\"future shock\\"  yarn in which you can tell what the hell people are talking about. It's best to remember, though, that Wingove has chosen here to avoid both the idyllic view of humanity's future Star Trek postulates, where mankind may have its difficulties with other worlds but we've finally learned how to live well with fellow Earthlings, and the premise that by the time a few more centuries have elapsed, homo sapiens has made such a huge mess of things that he's obliterated everything that's Earthlike about Earth--as the song goes: \\"the end of the world as we know it\\". The Wingrove approach has character Kim Ward facing both childhood bullying and its adult version. Yup, that problem's still around a couple of centuries down the road. There's a new head-solitaire today's liberals are into about childhood bullying that it's a curable disease, based on the liberal belief that humankind's social evolution happens as quickly as our technology evolves. The problem with that premise is that most of the world's ills have their roots in the fact that it definitely does not. The impulse for people to entertain themselves in part by causing suffering in others is part of the onboard firmware. You treat it on a case-by-case basis by remembering that even if the offender is a minor child, bullying is assault and/ or harassment, and you get people to stop soing that by making the afraid of what will happen to them if they continue. Kim Ward's protectors/ mentors do a lousy job of that, with the disastrous results you will read about in this book.a new head-solitaire today's liberals are into about childhood bullying that it's a curable disease, based on the liberal belief that humankind's social evolution happens as quickly as our technology evolves.

As for heroes, remember that poor  guy in the &quot;Op-Center&quot; books who was in mourning for the death of  his Korean-born wife who'd been killed in the first book? Evidently, the  lady had been the type of partner who married people mean when they use the  expression &quot;my better half&quot; to describe their spouses. Don't get  me wrong--who wouldn't want to identify with a dude who had an old lady  like her? The problem was, it had to have jammed up Our Hero's ability to  perform some really critical duties.

It also fills in a missing  chapter in the life of Worf's son Alexander--we knew him as a little boy on  TNG, then he shows up on DS9 as a young Klingon crewman serving under  General Martok. This book gives us a glimpse of his adolescence. Deanna  Troi has turned me on bigtime since her first appearance on the DS9  series--she reminded me right from jumpstreet of an old friend I've known  since we were both twentysomething. We're still friends and she remains to  this day the most delightfully feminine woman I've ever personally known.  Here's hoping Peter David has more to tell about her. Maybe an &quot;Imzadi  III&quot; based on her rekindled relationship with Riker?	1999-10-12

The characterizations of Munch as intellectual head-gamester who misses the designation &quot;nerd&quot; only because he leaves you with the slight impression that it might just be a lousy idea to mess with him,  Pembleton as tough but intelligent sleuth, Kellerman as somewhat immature  &quot;himbo&quot;, Lewis as levelheaded counterbalance to his colleagues'  emotional excesses, and Giardello's imposing but fatherly relationship with  his subordinates are dead-on. Priesman gets Colonel Barnfather's rank  wrong, though--I don't ever remember seeing him as only a captain on the  tube. Both this book series and its screen counterpart (as well as the  &quot;competition&quot; of &quot;NYPD Blue&quot;) mark a renaissance in the  &quot;cop story&quot; genre. The killing spree of two escapees from a  hospital for the criminally insane doesn't dominate the whole story as used  to be the case back when cops were seen as a faceless mass of &quot;Blue  Meanies&quot; and the &quot;problems&quot; of the criminals were all anyone  was supposed to care about. I know it had to evolve beyond the knight-like  Sergeant Friday &amp; Dan Matthews, but the social work theory of police  work was no &quot;evolution&quot;. Nor were Ponch &amp; Jon, who were only  a notch more serious than Barney Miller. Baltimore's &quot;Homicide&quot;  cops are PEOPLE--guys with problems at home, problems with the brass,  problems with each other. They have strengths and weaknesses. Now here's  hoping that this series continues (Munch transferring to a &quot;Law &amp;  Order&quot; spinoff isn't quite enough--he comes off as really pretentious  and annoying over there), and that somebody gets on the stick and gives us  some books on Sipowicz &amp; co.	1999-10-12

A detente offer from an Imperial admiral who's starting to trust the Republic more than right-wing elements in his own military. The discovery of a new species whose children are its best  diplomats. But there are some major characters here who are definitely off  their game. For instance, Mara Jade, who I'd once thought of as a love  interest for Luke (after all, his first love turned out to be a long-lost  twin sister). But Mara and Luke go on a mission together, and she  constantly disses Artoo as a burden--with little regard for the bond he and  Luke share. She gets petulant when she can't speak telepathically to the  above new species like Luke can. And she's still making self-serving  excuses why she washed out of Luke's Jedi Academy. It's an interesting spin  on the &quot;sensitivity&quot; and &quot;civility&quot;--maybe instead of a  huge evolutionary step by the time we're all roaring around the galaxy in  X-wings and TIE fighters, NEITHER gender will be worth a damn at it. Which  is a bummer out of the Star Wars universe--on the whole, ever since George  Lucas thought up Princess Leia, his followers into print have always been  better than the Star Trek crowd at coming up with strong women characters  who are gutsy ladies like Mirax Terrik (Mrs. Corran Horn) who don't have to  compromise their feminity, while the Trek bunch gives us the alpha-female  Seven Of Nine. Maybe that's who &quot;The Jadester&quot; is--Star Wars'  Seven Of Nine.	1999-09-30

Click on over to any of his books and that term's all over &quot;customer reviews&quot;. But he's chump change in that respect alongside this Flynn dude. Look at the blurbs from book reviewers on the inside cover of this  book and it's &quot;Clancy look back--someone's gaining on you&quot;. The  difference is that Jack Ryan &amp; co. come across as ADULTS rather than  overgrown adolescents. This story starts with commando-style hits on a  congressman and two senators. But everyone from the press to the White  House to the freshman congressman who's Our Hero is saying &quot;They  deserved to die&quot;. It struck me along about the third repetition that  if this were a movie, I'd be lip-synching the remark and annoying other  viewers. And you will notice that there are no positive minority characters  here--none whatever. Instead, what we get is a slighting reference to a  black congresswoman by one character--he thinks all she does is obsess on  political correctness and look for racists around every corner, plus the  fact that one of the commandoes makes himself up to LOOK black. In fact,  with few exceptions, the book is &quot;Eire-o-centric&quot; to the point of  aw-come-on. I know that as a &quot;Kraut-Mick&quot; myself it isn't  supposed to bother me, but it really grates on me. The whole message here  is that elected officials are all self-serving and don't belong in office,  but if you carry that too far, it verges on disrespect for the voter. I  mean hell-oooo? Real people voted for this &quot;shadow government&quot;.  Real Americans. In the real world, I myself voted for two senators and one  congressman. It's getting to the point where &quot;unworthiness for office  &quot; simply means &quot;my party's guy should've won&quot;. Yeah yeah  yeah, it's trendy to talk that way nowadays. But so are the Spice Girls.	1999-09-24

Two suburbanite couples who get involved in what used to be called &quot;wife-swapping&quot; back when that film came out? Rimmer offers a what-if secenario: what if the &quot;straying&quot; involved more than just  &quot;hot sex&quot;? And what if each partner involved still loved his or  her legitimate spouse as well? There are the usual variables involved. It's typical Rimmer for the quartet to decide that return to status quo ante might not necessarily be the right option, but he tends to gloss over the potential for a negative effect on the kids--each couple has two. Rimmer's body of work as a whole shows an overestimate of mankind's level of social evolution. All the ground gained along those lines during the period immediately before and after this book's original publication has since been lost right back and then some.	1999-09-14

You've got your same basic story premise--an off-the-beaten-path planet with a culture unaffected by either Alliance or Empire influence (but they're both trying--there ain't no &quot;prime directive&quot; here).  There's no planetary govenment--they're still at separate nation status.  Their military hardware consists of huge bombers, AWACS planes and fighters  a generation or so beyond the Tomcat fighters in Tom Clancy novels. General  Wedge Antilles (Luke Skywalker's loyal and courageous wingman from the  battle of Endor) even does a Picard and attracts a local lady's affections.  If it weren't for the fact that it's just as good a story as the rest of  the &quot;X-Wing&quot; series, I'd write this book off as derivative of  &quot;Insurrection&quot;. But I don't mind derivative. As long as its model  was worthwhile, and as I said, it's a good story. Hell's Bells, buy BOTH  books! But don't waste your time going &quot;uh huh&quot; over the  similarities. You paid your money, okay? Enjoy the read.	1999-09-09

A Native American reader would have to have  a lot of tolerance to be able to stomach the way the previous volume had a  well-meaning anthropology professor who just plain doesn't get it sending  Proud Wolf back east to school. Here, the school headmaster's teenage  daughter becomes infatuated with the guy. One can only speculate where her  head is at. Does Proud Wolf represent sort of a rebellion against Daddy? Or  does she find him more manly in comparison to the effete &quot;I say,  fella&quot; types she's used to? I can't see much respect involved in  either scenario. I'm going to grab the next one because the other story  lines in this trilogy make it worth it. But I definitely want to see if  Ross gives Proud Wolf's dignity back to him.	1999-08-27

Published in 1986,  this volume of Ross's &quot;Wagons West&quot; series has Ross' hero Toby  Holt (sort of a 19th century equivalent to Tom Clancy's Jack Ryan) dealing  with (would you believe?) an anti-government militia situation. It all  starts when his Oregon ranch foreman's sister is crowded off her Tennessee  farm by an crooked local official so that it can be used as a paramilitary  base for disgruntled Civil War vets brought together by a power-hungry  Cabinet official. Ross has only recently completed another prequel trilogy  to this very series--the &quot;West Empire&quot; trilogy--with the last  book out soon. So we know he's still in business. Since  &quot;Tennessee&quot; deals with an issue all too familiar nowadays, Ross  should consider suggesting a re-release to his publisher.	1999-08-19
