Sword and Sorcery knowing a good thing when they saw that brought the old cranky troll out of retirement and released what i beleive are ALL of the volumes of the old Grimtooth's traps released in 80s in one THICK, very nice volume.  The traps still are as lethal as can be, and in my opin were just waaaay too nasty for all of the old school gamers from way back.  Thankfully S&S press has added in DC modifiers for deactivating the triggers, and the entire trap which is nice for all the rogues in the group.  The art work is still very nice, and nearly all the traps, objects, hallway, and doors are depicted in nice B&W sketches.  From whirling blades of death, gravity wells, whipped cream filled pits, and waterfalls made of shaved diamond shards.  A creative if slightly off Dungeon master will find something horrible to throw at any level party.  Enjoy and make sure to Check for Traps before doing anything in a DM's game who has recently bought this book.  Grimtooth has been known to trap averything and anything.	2005-08-28

Republic Commando drops the reader right into the middle of a highly trained Republic Commando squad made up of the survivors of two other squads that met brutal ends during the Clone Wars.  The author Karen Traviss takes us inside the minds of these highly trained, lethal indiviuals who are not only battle hardened and war weary but also almost child-like at heart if not in body.  We are intorduced to Darman, Atin, Niner, Fi, and a young Jedi padawan named Etain Tur-Mukan who is clearly in need of a break if she is to continue along to become a Jedi Knight.<br /><br />  The book moves along very quickly, and the action is well paced with the base story involving the squad stopping the threat of a Separitist plot involving an experimental nano-virus and Mandalorian mercenaries on the backwater Outer Rim world of Quilara.  The squad must go in undetected and destroy the virus or else every clone of the Grand Army of the Republic could be condemned to death.  If you are a fan of Star Wars and like to see other stories involving unique and new heroes to this wonderful world of A Long Time Ago... then I migh suggest that you give this book a try, and also perhaps give the novel, Darth Maul: Shadow Hunter by Micheal Reeves a read as well.	2005-02-08

The Russian president thinks the only way to preserve his country is to drift away from democracy and fall back on old faithful communism.  The President decides to send in an NSA sponsored investigation team to ensure that the sophisticated spy plane was completely incinerated in the crash and that none of her crew has fallen into the hands of the Russians.<br />  Welcome to the world of Deep Black.  The book continues with the character of Charlie Dean who i believe was intro'd in the techno-thriller collection COMBAT, go read it.  I liked the cinematic characters of Charlie, Lia, and Tommy Karr who was one cool spy, and think that nearly every male reader of this type of genre imagines himself to be.<br />  The back story involving William Reubens head of Deep Black caught up in an imagninative murder at a relatives house doesn't really go anywhere, but the main story involving our heroes was intriguing filled with tough guy (and girl) dialogue, cool gadgets, and some old school Cold War intrigue, and a hint of romance.  Its not perfect, but an ideal read while sitting in the sun on vacation.  I am not very familiar with either author's work, but i will be looking more of their works in the near future. Have a fun summer.	2004-04-04

Races of Faerun provides more background to some of the lesser known, but just as popular other races that populate the Dungeons and Dragons world of Faerun.  For the more experienced players old friends such as the Winged Elves are finally brought up in the Third Edition rules.  For the new player many more choices will be laid out before them to make thier character truly unique, and game masters across the world will be pulling thier hair out as players try to utilize as much as possible in making the game their own.  Each of the 50 or so races are explored well, and in a fair amount of depth.  The book explores region, equipment, religion, and even feelings toward some of the other races.  The art is nice, and the game content is just first rate.<br />  This is one sourcebook that EVERYONE can use, and not have to worry about learning too much information.  The price is a bit steep for the half hearted player, but the book really is very nice, and worth the money you are going to shell out.  I was just happy to see one of my favorite raves the Wemic included, but was a bit disappointed that the Saurials were dropped for \\"Lack of Interest\\".  I was interested!  I won't let that one decision override or cloud a glowing review of another excellent product put out by Wizards of the Coast.	2003-03-21

This is Volume 1 of what i hope to be the entire Gi Joe Marvel Comic Book series reprinted in mind blowing digital color.  Volume 1 covers Gi Joe issues 1-10, and I have already gotten Volume 2.  for some reason amazon is not showing you the true cover art of the books which is just beautiful!!!!  This takes me back to 1982, where Reagan was president, and the Russinas were still the scariest people on the planet and Eddie Murphy was still funny.  This volume captures the sweet simplicity of mainstream comic books.  All the heroes are good, and the villians are bad.  No shades of grey in these here comic books!! Buy this volume.  Savor the simplicity of a summer spent reading Gi Joe when it was first run.  Don't think of it as marketing a new line of toys, cuz I'd like to think that that was not what the comic was about.  it was just good ole fashioned Good VS Evil, and the fate of the world lay in the hands of the men and woman of the GI Joe Team.<br />YO JOE!!!	2002-08-21

I grew up with them.  I read their comic, I played with their toys, and I watched their cartoon show.  i am not ashamed and enjoyed all three immensely.  Even now I am older, with less free time, and fewer toys to play with, but still the return of GI Joe left me very excited.  This Volume contains the first 4 issues of the new Image comic being published by Devil's Due and I have to say that it is just great!!!  The comic brings us up to speed with the GI Joe team who must once again stop Cobra, and Destro, and everyone's favorite maser of disguise Zartan.  The stories are all well done, and the art is simply beautiful.  Mind you this not a reprint, but all brand new first run stories.  So if you are a closet Joe like me.  Then do yourself a favor, and pick this one up!!!! Now drop and give me 20!!<br />Yo JOE!!!!	2002-08-21

This is one of those books that appears every so often, and if you don't buy it you regret for years to come.  The book is packaged in a textured synthetic dewback hide so be aware that no Dewbacks were hurt in the making of this book!!  The illustrations are rich, and full of life, and color.  The simple line sketches along with the reserved amounts of colors truly bring the creatures to life.  I certainly hope that amazon will allow some of the pictures to be seen so that the reader can witness just how beautiful these drawings are!  The authors, and artists explore some of the more well known, and some new creatures that inhabit the star wars universe, and do so in an intelligent, and also educational manner.  The book is a little pricey for the mildly interested, or younger buyers, but it is a book that can, and hopefully will be treasured for years.  A true winner and well worth a 5 star rating!	2001-12-17

Grisham's The Partner was an excellent book, and kept me guessing until the very last page.  This is only the second novel I have read by this author, but after the Firm, and now The Partner.  I think that i am sold on his work.  Patrick Lanigan steals 90 million dollars, and disappears into the outback of Brazil.  Four years later he is found, and is extradicted to the US to stand trial.  What follows next is a masterful look into false identities, the electronic movement of funds overseas, and more plot twists (pulled off successfully) then i have seen  in awhile.  If you are an old fan of Grisham's work, or a new fan like myself.  Treat yourself to The Partner, and with the deal Amazon has going right now.  You might as well get the Firm which was excellent as well.  enjoy!!	2001-09-25

The book is not cheap, and the price will definetly scare off all, but the most die-hard of players (which i consider myself to be one).  I bought the manual for the reason of trying to track down those elusive secret cars like the Nissan Z, Acura RSX, and the Dodge Viper (new model).  The manual does reveal how to get the secret cars, and also the best way to improve your times on the increasingly difficult driving tests.  This is where the magazine gets a little vague.  While it offers the best way to pass a test, or how to take a corner on a difficult track, but the solution offered is not foolproof so buyer beware.  This is not a end all be all of cheat manuals.  You still must drive fearlessly at blinding speeds, and be able to tune your car with the best of them if you wish to win the title of Grand Turismo Champion. That leads me up to my second beef with the book.  Since the game is so involved.  There are no \\"One size Fits All\\" settings when it comes to tuning up your machine.  This is not the book's fault, ...I had hoped for a little bit more insight. Overall the book is nicely packaged, and details most of the cars included in the game, but...  a hard sell for the younger crowd.  Enjoy and see you at Laguna!!!	2001-07-20

Now I would normally pass up on a trek book due to the sheer crapness that has become of trek fiction, but I saw Greg Cox's name attached to this one, and didn't think that he would disappoint.  Thankfully I was right!!!!  Cox has a flair with the trek characteres that has been sorely lacking recently.  He also has a flair of using favorite characters, and putting them into new circumstances.  Now with Eugenics wars which was foreshadowed in his Trek book Assignment:Eternity.  Cox reunites the crew of the Classic trek with favorite guest stars Khan Singh, and Gary Seven. The book is action packed, and seems to deliver a message regarding our own endeavors into genetics, and Cox appears in top form.  This is one for veteran fan, and newcomer alike.  Hope his next book is just as good, and enjoy.<br /><br />Edit June 30, 2013  Just realized that i had already reviewed this book.  It still holds up and think that it is one of the better Trek books out there that links classic fan favorites with the original crew of the Enterprise.  The many MANY references to Gen X pop culture makes the book that much more enjoyable.  Jaime Sommers, and the \\"Equalizer\\" mentioned in one chapter??  Be still my beating Heart!!!! Cox is just awesome, and a real treat for the senses.	2001-06-21

He also captures the bleakness of today where a new terminator has surfaced, and plans on taking out the Connors along with prompting the birth of its own creator, SkyNet. Follow me?  The book is a fun read, and I hope that another sequal follows.  Stirling did some heavy research, and that shows through actual use of dialogue, and written description of scenes from both of Cameron's movies.  Try to find the original two novels as well, and make a great day of it!  One dark note is Stirling continued reminder that John Connor is the savior of the human race, and also that his speech patterns haven't changed much since T2.  I don't believe anyone uses the word radical anymore let alone twice in one chapter.  it's a fun read, and leave it at that.  enjoy, and hopefully He'll Be Back!!!!	2001-06-12

Well thought out, and beautifully presented are the things that first come to mind upon reading this book.  The Forgotten Realms Campaign set is a wealth of gaming information for those who wish to base their gaming world within the land of Faerun.  The authors dive right into new races which may seem a little unbalanced at first, but it all works out trust me.  The new feats, and spells can be worked into any enviroment with little re-tooling.  The map is to put it simply, GORGEOUS!!!  Run out and get it laminated you'll thank me.  All the lands, and territories are explained in reasonable detail, and some other exotic lands are touched upon, Kara-Tur anyone?  Yes the book is a little pricey, but the information provided is in my opinion invaluable!!  The only thing missing is sadly the Saurials didn't make it to the final draft.  Well, maybe for 4e!!

The villian in the novel is intelligent, cunning, and very dangerous, and so the hero in return must also be intelligent, and insightful.  Patterson succeeded in keeping me on the edge of my seat through out much of the book, and I found most of his twists, and turns very entertaining.  Sadly what I did not find entertaining, intelligent, or even fresh was the routine use of the &quot;Black vs White&quot; mentality used by the star of the book Alex Cross.  I found the use of this really insulting, and it turned me off almost to the point of putting the book down. I could not understand why its inclusion made this a better book, or a better character.  I certainly hope that in the future Alex cross books, that Patterson was comfortable with himself as a writer that he no longer had to include such petty plot devices.	2001-04-27

Matt Reilly's book Ice Station is far from the great american novel, but it does provide some action filled escapism.  A mysterious ship found buried in the ice at the bottom of the world is cause for a fire team of marines to be sent to secure the ice station, and wind up running around trying not to get killed by invading French commandos, or eaten by Orca whales.  Reilly's conspiracy theories seemed inventive, and I thought it was entertaining to say the least.  His main characters are interesting to read about, and yeah I have to admit i liked Schofield, and the way that Reilly brought him to life on the pages.  I even found his use of the young girl Kristy no where near as annoying as I thought I might have.  Oh yeah the seal is pretty damn cute too.  His secondary characters are another story.  They seem a little thin, and all fit into nice neat little stereotypes.  Not that that is a bad thing, but it is glaringly apparent.  Overall I thought that it was good read, and was able to overlook the dramatic license that mister Reilly took with it.	2001-03-17

Darth Maul: Shadow Hunter was a truly entertaining Star Wars novel.  I am not a huge fan of the SW written works, and picked up this book just to see if they had gotten any better.  All i can say is that I was happy I did.  Reaves gives the reader a deeper insight into the shadowy character of Darth Maul as he sets out upon a mission of the utmost importance for his evil Sith master Lord Sidious. Reaves also introduces us to Lorn Pavan a down-on-his-luck scoundrel of the first degree, I-5 the sarcastic, and nearly sentient 'droid sidekick and one of my favorite characters the young jedi student Darsha Assant.  It was so refreshing to see the jedi portrayed in such a young, inexperienced yet focused role.  In most of the books they are portrayed as the Know-It-All protectors of the galaxy, and Reaves expresses that through Lorn's intense contempt for the Force Using crime fighters.  I loved the back story of Lorn's hatred for the Jedi, and thought that it was explored very well.  Darsha is bright, and shining, and made a wonderful addition to the Star Wars universe.  Yes the ending of the novel is intense, and dark, but then the good guys don't always win, even in Star Wars.  I respect Reaves for having the 'tude to tackle that ending the way he did.  BRAVO!!  I can go on, but any fan should read this book! It is fresh, new, and exciting, and I hope that you enjoy it as much as I did.	2001-02-23

Just finishing Allen Steele's book Oceanspace, and while it does manage to keep the reader interested with well researched informatation regarding crush depths, and breathing mixtures, and undersea research platforms.  It was not a book that i would consider reading a second time.  The story is good, and the reader indoctrinated into the world of undersea mining, and experimental naval subs, (um that seemed a little unlikely, but anyway)  The book's characters are easy to visualize, but lack  the depth to make them really interesting.  The teenager in the story is yes one big stereotype, but then so is the reporter who not only snoops around the station freely, and manages to gain acess to a high security sub bay with no problem, but also tries to seduce the story's hero in a clumsy attempt.  Oh yeah there is a sea monster in the book but only for about 10 collective pages so don't blink.  Had Steele put more time, and effort into the story and the characters.  i feel that he could have given the reader a much better, and more in depth story then this little &quot;puddle-jumper&quot; read.  Too bad it seemed to have a lot of potential, but then that is just my opinion.	2001-01-17

This book takes a deep and detailed look into the Fighter, and Monk class of the 3rd Edition rules for D&amp;D.  The new list of added feats is extensive, and are for the most part excellent. I cannot wait to incorporate them into my next character. The manual also introduces new weapons to specialize in, and includes many new prestige classes to allow players a chance to customize their characters even further.  My fave is the Samurai, but then he always was anyway! The art within the book is quite good, and helps to put a face with the character so to speak.  We even get quotes from the &quot;iconic&quot; characters that were presented within the Player's Handbook.  I thought it was nice touch, and I hope that the trend continues to help personalize each book in the set.  I can't wait to see the Cleric book!!  Enjoy it, and Keep Gaming!	2001-01-04

The novel takes place shortly after the first book in the Sembia series, Halls Of Stormweather, and as it has been said before. You should go read that one first.  Erevis Cale the mysterious, and ever loyal butler is up to his doublet in  demonic trouble, and only Jak Fleet veteran thief, and cleric is able to assist him.  The book is rich with intrigue, and I was enthralled with Kemp's characters, and vibrant story telling ability.  Kemp's characater of Cale is the perfect blend of tortured soul, and anti-hero.  We know what he is capable of, but still would trust him with our lives.  I hope to see much more of Kemp's work, and much more of Erevis Cale!!	2000-12-13

Spine of the World picks up from the end of Silent Blade, and was a suprisingly dark story.  The reader gets to see the trusted, and tortured hero Wulfgar coming to terms with the apparent shambles that his life has become.  Drunk, and disorderly, and becoming increasingly violent, I had to wonder if this may be Wulfgar's last stand.  His violence soon costs him the only home that he is known in the city of Luskan, and he is expelled.  Wulfgar, and his traveling companion/Drow spy Morik are soon accused of attempting to murder an old friend, and what follows makes the torture scene in Braveheart look tame! Wulfgar, and Morik manage to escape, and move on to a very different future, and one that I could not stop reading.  Salvatore really explores the depths of his characters in Spine of the World, and yet I sorely missed Drizzt save for the periodic diary entires. It was an excellent read, and I plan to read it again.  Just give it a chance, and I am sure that you will not be disappointed in this very different story from the Forgotten Realms.

Did I mention that Christine is a 1958 Plymouth Fury?  King masterfully crafts a story of mystery, terror, and even a little romance.  Now I loved the movie, and hoped that the book would be able to stand on its own.  Well it does, and explores in more depth the relationship between Arnie, Christine, and ole' Roland D. LeBay.  It does take a few plot twists that were not in the movie, but for the majority they are all positive.	2000-11-22

I really enjoyed the book, and felt that Crichton did very well in presenting his story of the minefield that is Office Politics.  I am very familiar with the subject matter, and was able to identify with a lot of the material that Crichton presented throughout Disclosure.  The characters of Tom Sanders, and Meridith Johnson were interesting to read about, and Crichton has always done well with presenting his heros, and villians as deep well thought out characters.  The book is not perfect, and Sanders gets very lucky in some tense scenes, and were this real life, and not a novel.  I am sure that the ending could have been quite different.  Overall I really enjoyed the book, and can gladly give it a favorable review.  I hope you enjoy it as well.	2000-10-18

I eagerly look forward to the next book, and think that the butler with a past Cale, will go on to become one of the Realm's favorite characters.  Though Cale is a stand out in the book.

From the discovery of  the Crystal Shard to the scimitar whirling conclusion of the Halfling's  Gem.  The book in my opinion does not disappoint. The novels are packed  full of adventure, intrigue, and yes even a little romance.  Salvatore's  writing is tight, and imaginative, and his characters quickly endear  themselves to the reader.  His trademark action sequences never disappoint,  and above all else we get our first glimpse into the heart, and mind Drizzt  Do'Urden.  Yes I must agree with the previous reviewers on their take of  the rather shoddy job of proof-reading, but I wouldn't let that spoil a  wonderful read!	2000-08-18

I grew up on Dungeons, and Dragons, and am unashamed to say that yes I am  a gamer.  Wizards of the Coast along with a slew of playtesters from around  the world have reinvented the game that started it all.  The book is very  informative, and is richly illustrated.  Lockwood's drawings alone are  worth the price of this amazingly inexpensive, and informative book.  The  Handbook will enable players to get started playing, and veteran players up  to speed on the new edition. I am not sure of how quickly they will be  jumping in though, as the book completely starts from scratch all the  sytems that we knew in our sleep.  The re-intorduction of the Monk  character is nice, and very nostalgic of of WoC, and I commend them.  I do  see a negative side though as that while very helpful, and informative.  The book leaves too many doors closed with only a simple &quot;Wait til we  release the next book&quot; mentality.  For example experience points which  are critical to the advancement of the player's character are glossed over  as an afterthought.  The reader is given the explaination that it will be  focused on more in the Dungeon Master Guide, and to please stay tuned.  Not  a smart move in my opinion in which new players are being courted.  Overall  the book is an excellent value, and should make game play quick, simple,  but without sacrificing &quot;Role Playing&quot;.	2000-08-15

Salvatore really brought to life the legend of Drizzt Do'Urden in this absolutely wonderful trilogy set in the Forgotten Realms gaming universe.  Salvatore's tortured dark elf has grown to be one of the most  popular heros of all the Realms.  Even though introduced in Salvatore's  previous novels (the Crystal Shard trilogy).  Drizzt's early life is  documented through this thick tome, and just endears himself to both the  new, and the Dungeons and Dragons experienced reader.  For the new to the  Realms reader, some of the creatures mentioned within are confusing, but  overall the book is fantastic, and well written, and full of trademark  Salvatore fight scenes!  I felt that the final book in the set, Sojurn was  my favorite, and have enjoyed all of Drizzt's other adventures very much.	2000-07-12

I found Steve Alten's MEG scary, fun, and gory all in one.  Some of the sequences in the novel are amazing, and I could just hear that certain other shark  music in my head as I flashed through attack after attack.  The sheer size,  and complexity of the star of the book amazes me, and I applaud Alten on  his research on the megaladon. Had I had this book on vacation.  I never  would have gone near the water!  The only down side i saw in this book was  the lame surf boy/stud scene.  After going through what he went through I  would have just collapsed onto the sand, and said I am taking up golf!  Other than that.  This was a great read!  Can't wait to read the sequel.  hey isn't there supposed to be a movie?	2000-07-07
US	52906127	R13DPXGKFKEE7N	0449220893	757924758	Beast	Books	5	1	1	N	N	An Excellent Summer Read!	Peter Benchley is the king of &quot;beach novels&quot;, and BEAST is no exception.  Yes all of Benchley's books have been compared to JAWS, and how he just keeps writing the same thing over, and over.  Well if the formula  works.  Why change it?  BEAST is compelling, and filled with rich, strong  characters that move the story along quickly.  Whip Darling the novel's  hero is an excellent &quot;everyman&quot; hero, and the Beast is just plain  scary!  Benchley's vivid descriptions of scenes in the book has always  been his strongest point in my opinion.  Through Benchley's writing the  reader can really get a sense of what is happening in key scenes, and some  of these scenes are terrifying, indeed.  After JAWS, and BEAST.  I am  surprised that i even go in the water anymore! From the opening scene to  the final, and surprising climax  BEAST satisfys, and entertains.	2000-07-04
US	52906127	RFSD4KM3P658V	0399145931	699086817	Sea Fighter	Books	5	6	8	N	N	An Excellent Summer Read!	james Cobb hits home again with his latest installment of Commander (now Captain) Amanda Garrett.  This time Cobb takes us to the Dark Continent of Africa, which is currently embroiled in their latest civil war.  Sadly the  USS Cunningham only appears breifly in a moving &quot;changing of the  guard&quot; scene which i thought was one of the book's best moments.  Captain Garrett is given command of the experimental hovercrafts known as  the Sea Fighers, and procedes to wage a Brown Water war that was very  exciting to read.  The novel reads quickly, and the characters I felt were  well written, and very humanistic.  Cobb has always had a little problem  with getting to cliche when it came to the relationship of the CO, and her  lover, chief Helo pilot Vince Arkady, and thankfully Arkady isn't one of  Sea Fighter's major players.  The action sequences are very good, and the  thought, and basis behind the combat hovercrafts seemed new, and  innovative. The techno-speak of Sea Fighter is just enough to make you  think that you are there, without making you feel like you should have  joined the Service to be able to read it.  Thank God for the glossary  though when you get lost!  I loved it, buy it, and stay tuned for his next  book entitled Sea Scourge!  keep it up Jim!	2000-06-17
US	52906127	R25LERV50U4VK7	0671035797	648645185	Enterprise Logs: Star Trek	Books	2	2	5	N	N	Average at Best	After finishing the Enterprise Logs. It was hard for me to believe that all of the included stories were written by previously established, and otherwise well respected Star Trek authors.  I have read other works by  most of these authors, and I was amazed, and very disappointed in how bad  some of these stories were.  Most of the stories seem to be thrown together  with almost minimal character structure behind them.  The reader is  instantly thrown into the story, and expected to feel some rapport with the  lesser known Captains of the famous ships known as Enterprise. The Captain  Decker story, and the Captain Harriman story while far from perfect at  least made the book bearable.  In my opinion it seemed as if each  author were attempting to out do the next with a special revelation, or  accenting on an important point in the Trek legend.  Now at first the  concept is exciting, but after two, or three below average stories.  The  shine wears very quickly off of the concept, and makes it feel cheap, and  &quot;fanish&quot;.  I am very disappointed in this book, and feel that  with further poor decsions like this one.  It will only drive the audience  away, and find other series to enjoy.	2000-06-13

Being a big fan of the techno-thriller genre, and a huge fan of submarines, buying this book was a no brainer.  Now I was unfamiliar with the author, but Riker drops you right into the driver's seat of both the  state-of-the-art Los Angeles class as well as the aging Grayback, and  doesn't let you up for air.  The book has something for everyone from SEAL  teams to skulking Russian attack subs to a climax that has to be read!  Talk about the edge of my seat!  Someone read this, and go &quot;hmm..  we  could make that into a movie!&quot;  A throughly good read, and I can't  wait until his next Silent Service book comes out in Spring 2001	2000-03-21

The book was a muddled disappointment, and I was just happy to be finished with  it.  The story immediately grabbed me, but then i am a sucker for the Drow.  The thought of Drow infiltrating, and attempting to take over a town  through magical guises was original. Sadly the story gets bogged down in  too many characters, and an over abundance in the claok-and-dagger. The  ending I thought fell flat, and left me very disappointed in the resolution  of the story.  If you are a Greenwood fan then my review is moot, but if  you are a first timer to the words of the Forgotten Realms.  Please pick  another book, and not this one.	2000-01-09

His book has all the makings of classic fantasy.  A rugged hero  to root for, an evil villain to boot, and a sassy Faerie sidekick to make us  wonder how come our games didn't have pixies like her!  The mountain  scenes are well done, and even though some of the other interesting rooms  were missed.  You do get a feeling of Deja-Vu reading them after all of  these years.  A fun read, and enjoy it!	1999-12-17

Both of his stories I thought were excellent, and provide the reader with an advance look at his upcoming title Sea Fighter.  I had never read the other authors, and as another reviewer mentioned.  It  made me check out  some of the authors longer works.  Well worth the read  for Techno fans!	1999-11-27
US	52906127	RYF7YDL297ZL1	038529929X	313045692	Hannibal: A Novel	Books	2	0	0	N	N	Left me Unsatisfied	Again another example of too much hype.  Silence of the Lambs was an outstanding book, but sadly Hannibal does not even compare to that creepy masterpiece.  The book starts off at a breakneck pace, but the second half  of the book just left me confused, and unfufilled.  I kept thinking that  this was not the Lector that I had enjoyed  so much in Harris' previous  books. The ending in my opinion is a total cop out, and seems totally  implausible, and thats all I'll say about it.  In closing read Red Dragon,  and Silence, but stay away from this one!!	1999-06-18

The  Wave is portrayed in a truly  frightening, and awe inspiring light.  The sequence on the airstrip in  Hawaii, and aboard a submarine was very moving, and scary. The hero Mitch  Webber's ability to fly everything under the sun is explained, and I  thought that the talent was an ingenius way to introduce to the reader ALL  sorts of different aircraft.  The last third of the book is excellent, but  yes it does take a little time to get there. overall i say go ahead and buy  it, but please be patient with it.  Guys I still Love your work!!	1999-03-17

I picked up Sea Strike right after finishing Cobb's previous book Choosers of the Slain, and I found that I could not put the book down.  I enjoyed his potrayal of the central character Amanda Garrett, and relished in just enough techno-babble to keep me  thinking &quot;Wow this stuff is amazing&quot;  The USS Cunningham is truly a remarkable piece of fictional machinery, and I can't wait to see her, and Garrett sail again soon!!!	1998-08-04
