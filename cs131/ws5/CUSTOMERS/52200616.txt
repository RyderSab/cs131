A Russian Perils of Pauline	Despite some interesting characters and occasionally rich and lovely language, this book was irretrieveably brought down by a frankly silly plot. One reviewer accurately described it as a penny dreadful-type story.  For a time I thought the writer might be using the old-fashioned style to write a clever book, but the last few chapters fatally undermined that hope. I have heard that later on the series improves, but I can't see sticking it out.	2004-05-08

At 900 pages this book is merely okay, but at 400-500 it would have been great.	2004-01-10

The language was beatiful; the story moved briskly, with old fashioned cliffhanging chapters; Fandorin is an engaging character. Unfortunately, the basic plot is frankly silly, and for me spoiled the enjoyment of the book's good elements. The ending seemed especially gratuitous.<br />I decided on this basis not to read the rest of the series, though I note one reviewer tells those put off to stick with the series--perhaps the plots get stronger.  Certainly the era offered plenty of basis for more realistic plots.	2003-12-27

Holden takes a gripping, but fairly standard plot, and wraps it with a meditation on family and friendship, cowardice and courage. He gives his character an extraordinary voice, and uses nuances of language and style to give the story a depth and subtlety rarely seen in thrillers.	2003-06-27

A thriller with just enough romance and comic relief.	2002-01-19

It is also nice that Gregor and Bennis have at long last gotten together since that relationship was long in the tooth to be so up in the air. Haddam puts together her usual large cast of complex and convincing characters and suspects, in this well-plotted and fascinating mystery.	2001-08-26

First, how come the researcher kept discovering info in the chronicalogical order of his subjects lives? Hardly likely. Second that the Baker Estate apparently existed in trust without any actual heirs/owners, and that the lawyer with control of the estate didn't just get the papers she wanted and had access to, but constructed an elaborate plot to get a researcher to basically steal them from her--please. The fish out of water Easterner in the West also rang false as did almost all the modern relationships. Sorry.	2001-08-26

While the plot was fairly strong, the writing was not up to Ms. Howatch's usually excellent standards. The bare bones stuck out too much--I felt like I was reading an earlier draft that had not yet had the rough edges polished off. The dialogue, especially Carter's interior dialogue was clunky, repetitive and unconvincing. Many of the events seemed labored and over the top. Did her husband Kim really have to be a Nazi and involved in the occult, and in perverse sex? Themes were pushed hard instead being more quietly illustrated by the story itself. Howatch still writes a gripping spiritual thriller, but this needed more work.	2001-04-28

Other elements were mixed, many of the characters were well-done, but a few were cartoons, despite the last minute efforst to show the \\"real\\" under surface of the type. The heroine strayed too often into the realm of spunky/perky for my taste, but if that appeals to you, you will like this. The contemporary plot line was weak and far fetched with little real mystery, no detection and no real clues given except for one major instance of suspect behavior.	2001-02-10

This one is a great outing with rival researchers claiming the rights to a break- through tomato--one that can stand up to travel and still taste like something--wouldn't that be great?  Mixing the profit motive and academic pride proves to be a deadly combination. Violence in the greenhouses and among the footnotes. A fast paced mystery with an orginal and credible plot.	2001-01-01

At his best Chandler is great, but the Big Sleep owes its fame more to the Humphrey Bogart movie than the writing. The book was cobbled together from several short stories, and once you know this it is fairly obvious--the books cuts from scene to scene and it is hard pressed to make a connection between them.  While some consider this a sign of a daring new lack of convention and  or a mirror of the confusion of modern society, in truth it is really more a case of laziness.  Nonetheless the book has classic scenes and gives us Marlowe, which alone makes it worthy of reading. And that Noir atmosphere is delicious.	2001-01-01

The ones with a religious setting such as this one are particularly good. Demarkian is particulary expert at wending his way thorugh tight-lipped communities with secrets of their own. An ex-FBI often called into consult on delicate cases and a murder in a Catholic church is more than delicate. Written with deft touch, respect for religious communities, and little saving humor.	2001-01-01

A gripping mystery full of sad but gritty integrity. Scudder is dogged in pursuit of the unpleasant truth on behalf of a father who wants to know what is he &quot;doesn't want to know&quot;.

It is a little different than his usual adventure-thrillers.  This is a serious book about the naval war of World War II. The North Atlantic convoy runs saw some of the highest casualties during the war and MacLean puts the reader squarely in the middle of that icy Nordic hell.  What happens when men are pushed far too far makes for some of the most gripping reading around.	2000-12-31

Set on the mean streets of a Canadian city this story follows a middle aged cop trying to keep with the times, to take care of the people his turf, solve crimes, and help his friends--not all of which is mutually compatible.

Hill is an exceptionally fine writer and the Dalziel and Pascoe mysteries show off his skills at their best.  This is first mystery in the series and sets the tone and introduces characters for the books to come. In itself it is a gripping mystery set in  chilly Yorkshire in the blue collar world of a rugby club, where camaraderie and tension vye with equal measure, where secrets seep through by word of mouth until they act as the match to trigger an explosion. Dalziel springs fullformed from the Author's forehead while Peter Pascoe begins his struggle with his ambivilence between a liberal conscious and a police job. Some readers may find the dialect and attitudes a bit hard to get through but this is series that develops well as it ages.	2000-12-29

It also shows that people have good sound reasons for doing what to us initially may seem crazy and irrational.
