US	51701102	R3CYY47QO9P3NR	0679421475	426549876	And the Dead Shall Rise: The Murder of Mary Phagan and the Lynching of Leo Frank	Books	4	10	17	N	N	Detailed account of 2 tragedies	Being a native Atlantan, I had obviously heard of the Mary Phagan murder / Leo Frank lynching before and knew the basic facts but was not much interested in delving into it until now. <br /> <br />I am so outraged and ashamed of my fellow Georgians at the time of Leo Frank's circus trial and the lynching of what I believe to be an innocent man. <br /> <br />This book is extremely detailed and I admit, I skimmed some pages but I do believe the detailed biographies and histories of the people involved are very important in understanding motivations, etc. <br /> <br />I never knew there was so much anti-Semitism in Atlanta.  This was an explosion waiting to happen and in my opinion, by the time Leo Frank was kidnapped and murdered by a group of thugs, the motivation no longer had anything to do with Mary Phagan's murder - it was just a convenient excuse. <br /> <br />If you're interested in this case and plan to only read one book on the subject, this is the one to buy.  Highly recommended.	2005-08-25

I understood early on that the anger and jealousy would end up being replayed in Kate, Greg, and Jon but I couldn't figure out which one of the guys would be Marcus or Nion. <br /> <br />But, the ending really confused me.  Is Kate now 'possessed' by Claudia or is she still Kate, in love with Jon?  Is Jon now 'possessed' by Nion or is he still Jon, in love with Kate?  Is Greg now 'possessed' by Marcus and will pursue Kate/Claudia and Jon/Nion?  Or is the ending saying that he let go of Marcus out of his love for Kate? <br /> <br />Very confusing.  But, aside from that, I loved the book.  Read the first half one night and stayed up until 2:00 AM the next night reading the last half.  Could not put it down.  Would have liked a lot more clarity for the ending though.	2005-07-08

Even though I'm a native Atlantan, I've never been interested in the Civil War (or The War Between The States) but I am very interested in Appalachian history.  It is Sharyn McCrumb's talent that made me care about this particular chapter of the Civil War - Sharyn explained a lot about the complexities of the issues that led to the war and the people who lived through it.  It's not black and white (no pun intended) and really made me think about what choices I would have made if I had lived then. <br /> <br />The only drawback to the book as far as I am concerned is that I wish the Ghosts had been explored more.  Why are they still riding?  They knew the war was over during their lifetimes.  Also, the character of Tom Gentry was unnecessary in my opinion -I don't really understand why his character was needed.  But, all in all, I loved this book and I highly recommend it and all other Sharyn McCrumb books.  If you're at all interested in Appalachian history - she's the best!	2005-06-13

The mystery was really good but what I enjoyed even more than that was the history of the coal miners and their way of life.  I am very interested in Appalachian studies and it was a bonus that this book really fed into my interest, and has led me to look into some of the books that Rett MacPherson cites as some of her sources in the back of this book. <br /> <br />Very enjoyable read!	2005-05-27

Her descriptions of the sights and smells of London of the time are fantastic.  I also love the vernacular of the characters.  There is nothing worse than reading a \\"period\\" book when the characters sound like they're in the 21st century.   <br /> <br />If you enjoy period mysteries full of perfectly described details, don't miss this book!	2005-05-22

Torie O'Shea is a wonderful, down to earth, everyday woman character.  I think I AM Torie O'Shea!   <br /> <br />The mystery aspect of the book is interesting but what really makes this book such fun to read is Torie, her husband Rudy, her mom (and mom's developing \\"friendship\\" with the Sheriff who is 12 years her junior, and who Torie considers her arch-enemy), Torie's jam-session playing dad, and the other citizens of New Kassell.  I especially like the \\"News You Might Miss\\" columns from Eleonore. <br /> <br />A great, fun, light reading book with some true laugh out loud comments. <br /> <br />Don't miss it! <br /> <br />(I've already read the 2nd in the series and am about to start the 3rd).	2005-05-14

She's a great mother but not all that likeable to other people.  Once I found out what she had done in Florida, that was it.  I felt no empathy for her whatsoever. <br /> <br />I'm still not clear on why Marta felt she had to resort to prostitution as a teenager.  Was it for the money only?  Was it because of her mother?  Was it because of her stepfather?  This was never fully explained. <br /> <br />And, with everything that happened with Laura and David while going through their crisis and what is going on with Laura regarding work once her secrets are out, there was no ending!  What happened?  The author could have at least done a few 'epilogue' pages to wrap up the story lines. <br /> <br />Sorry, but I was disappointed.	2005-05-05

It has everything - marriage, kids, sex, friendship, betrayal (on several layers), mother-daughter relationships.  You name it.  <br /> <br />This book is an absolute tour de force.  I loved (and lived) every page.  Can't rate it high enough. <br /> <br />This is the 2nd Joy Fielding book I've read (you must read Whispers and Lies too).  I'm on the lookout for more.  Both of the novels I've read by Joy Fielding have had my jaw dropping at certain points.   <br /> <br />Fantastic. <br /> <br />	2005-03-11

I thought the characters were well developed and I enjoyed the paranormal story of Alaisdair and Viola as well.

I literally was skimming the pages 1/2 way through just to get to the conclusion.  The female \\"heroine\\" is so weak kneed and pathetic it's amazing she can tie her shoelaces by herself not to mention track down her missing son!  She kept complaining how everyone thought of and treated her as a crazy person and honey! if the loony bin fits...!<br />I realize this was a first book attempt and heaven knows I don't have the talent for writing but if you read this book just go in with eyes wide open.	2003-06-26

Mr. Cornwell really makes history come alive with the story of the Newgate prison, the politics and class divisions of early 19th century England and, if you are a cricket fan, this book is definitely for you!<br />I hope this is the first in a series of books with the same characters; they are very well developed and the ending is primed for a sequel.  Also, I would really like the stories of some of the secondary characters to be told (especially Sally's Highwayman brother).	2003-06-06

It lead me to investigate the real Isobel and what happened to her.  I don't want to give away any spoilers but what the book has Edward I condemning her to really happened!<br />I've read several other books by Barbara Erskine and highly recommend them all.  Lady of Hay is another one that has a story based on real people.  The format of the present day character always switching places with the historical person wears a bit thin after a few of her books but I guess if you find a format that works, don't change it!<br />Highly recommended	2003-01-14

The only drawbacks to me were I wish the story line had been extended at certain places (e.g. when one of the &quot;historical&quot; characters switched places with the &quot;current time&quot; character) and the only other thing that bothered me was that I thought the main character was a little &quot;wimpy&quot; (I mean, she's 40ish - not a teenager!)<br />But, having said that, I did really enjoy the book and would read this author's other works.	2003-01-14

I did like this book - I read it in one sitting - however, I find it difficult to believe that in this day and time the police in 1 city (not to mention 2!) would be as condescending to a domestic crime victim as they are in this book and would not take wife/child abuse accusations seriously.  Other than that this book is a suspenseful, fast read, with the reader wondering if Sharon is being stalked or is it the newly resurrected Janice Young?	2002-06-14

If you are as rabid a Jamie and Claire (and Gabaldon) fan as I am and have been waiting for this book for over 4 years as I have, I'm afraid I have some bad news - this story is completely flat!  I thought maybe the events of September 11th had colored my perspective (in realizing what is truly important) but, in reading other reviews, I find I'm not alone in saying that The Fiery Cross is definitely a let down!  While the dialogue between Jamie and Claire in Outlander through Drums of Autumn was sexy, poignant, heartfelt, sometimes angry, and sometimes hilarious, some of the dialogue in The Fiery Cross is just embarrassingly syrupy and saccharine.  In short, I don't like this Jamie - he's hardened and sarcastic at times; I'm getting really fed up with Claire being looked on as a witch in every book and every country she's in (does she ever get past this?) and Roger and Brianna just need to grow up!  I found The Fiery Cross definitely &quot;filler&quot; material and I hope &quot;Sons of Liberty&quot; doesn't take 4 years to complete.	2001-12-03

While I enjoyed that book I mainly bought The Burning Road due to a feeling of wanting to at least finish the series as it is so far.  I have just finished reading The Burning Road and all I can say now is WHEN IS THE NEXT INSTALLMENT?  This book picks up a decade later in the medieval chapters and Alejandro has taken Kate out of England and back to France where a very important new character comes into their lives and drags them into the current political intrigues there.  Meanwhile, back in 2007 America, Dr. Jane Crowe has come across some very disturbing instances of severe spinal injuries for no apparent reason and DR SAM is rearing its ugly head again.  Oh - and she also must make a decision which of the men in her life she really wants to be with.  I love medieval history (and even pure fiction) so I did enjoy those chapters a little more than the &quot;contemporary&quot; chapters although those are sufficient to scare you to death about the possibilities of the (near?) future.  A wonderful read!	2001-05-12

The Broken Sword picks up where The  Forever King left off in today's time period but it dealt much more with  Merlin's story.  It just depends on which story you are more interested in.   I am very excited about the next book and hope it is published soon.   <br />As a side bar, if the authors are reading this review - I would really  like to see the stories of Hal's (Galahad) lives through the centuries as  he has been reborn looking for Arthur.<br />Very good books!

While  Alex is a lot like Jamie, MANY historical romance heroes are alike -  especially if you narrow down the topics to roughly the same time period  and the same country.  Bottom line - if you like the Outlander series you  will like Kilgannon (I read it in one sitting!).  I really loved the  historical research that went into this book.
