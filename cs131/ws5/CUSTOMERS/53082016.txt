As the years went on he bought successive editions, giving me his old copies. I still have the first of these, a \\"revised and enlarged\\" edition of 1933.<br /><br />I grew up with maps. I remain fascinated with them and use them (and create them) constantly in my work. That old _Goode's_  is one of dozens of atlases on my shelves, and one of eight editions of this title that I have owned. The newer editions of it are the atlases I refer to most frequently. When I need more detail I try the massive and wonderful _Times World Atlas_, or turn to various geographic software packages I own. But nine times in ten I quickly find what I need, clearly and attractively presented, in _Goode's_. When I must travel to do my work and can take only one atlas, it is _Goode's_.<br /><br />Despite its compact and handy size, _Goode's_ does not compromise on coverage and detail. In fact, it is better on both counts than the great majority of \\"coffee-table\\" atlases. The key to this is that _Goode's_ is a just-the-fact atlas. There are no pictures, the text is brief and to the point. Fundamentally this is a map book. Color, shading, and standardized symbols are used effectively convey information. The density of presentation is chosen judiciously, packing as much information as possible in each map without making it necessary to squint through a magnifier. The gazetteer is excellent and comprehensive for an atlas of this size. Introductory material includes a nice introduction to cartography and map projections. There is a superb section of global thematic maps, analyzing many particular features of the physical and social landscape, and specialized thematic maps for each major region of the globe. This is an atlas with everything that is necessary and nothing that is not. No other atlas can come close for generalutility, let alone value.<br /><br />The only other atlas I have ever found that could compare in any way with _Goode's_ is the beautiful first edition of _The Oxford Atlas_, compiled in Britain after World War II when the economic conditions made skilled work astonishingly cheap. Unfortunately, the _Oxford_ has gone far downhill since then.<br /><br />If you want a good desk atlas for reference, this is the one.	2005-04-07

It brings the Pacific Army to life in a way that no one else had even attempted.     Like any book, however, it has its limitations, and as is usually true it is the ones that author was not aware of (at least at the time) and did not flag for our attention that we must take most care of. In this case the principal limitation lies in strategic view.     The Philippines, as the author makes clear, never had any intrinsic significance for the United States (or for the earlier colonial power, Spain, for that matter) -- no riches or resources to be reaped. The sole significance of the islands lay in their position. Initially, Americans had calculated (like the Spaniards before them) that possession of Manila would provide an important advantage in gaining the rewards of the rich China trade. Luzon and the rest of the islands simply came with the deal. Almost as soon as they had been seized, however, other events eroded Manila's importance in this role greatly. (Perhaps we should say \\"seeming importance,\\" as there never were the prospects which had been envisioned in 1898.) Finding themselves in possession of a colony of little value, Americans not unnaturally felt reservations about spending large sums to garrison and defend it. Thus a purely nominal force was assigned to its defense, adequate only for internal security and the assertion of sovereignty. The oft-proclaimed \\"bastion\\" of the Philippines was in reality no more than a sentry post, bound to be overrun quickly in any serious assault. To invest in a real Philippine fortress or in mobile forces strong enough to quickly relieve it would involve an expense that few Americans could see as justified.    Distant events changed all that. By the late 1930s, of course, the propensity of Japan for aggressive military expansion was manifest, but that did not seem particularly threateningin itself, given that the economic resources of the country were so small relative to those of the U.S.  But the outbreak of the European War in 1939, followed by the Nazi defeat of France and threat to Britain in 1940, heightened American security concerns vastly. Then in September, 1940, Japan joined the Axis Pact, making itself an ally of Germany. Japan had intended this to change American perceptions and it did that, but not in the way that had been hoped. Japan ceased to be a disagreeable nuisance in a distant place and instead clearly became a potential part of a serious threat, to be blocked if possible and crushed if necessary. Very suddenly, the importance of the Philippines' geographic position changed dramatically.    It is this transition that Prof. Linn misses in focusing on the local realities rather than the global strategic picture that dominated the awareness of Washington decision-makers in 1940-41. This broader reality is well presented in Waldo Heinrichs, \\"Pearl Harbor in a Global Context,\\" in _Pearl Harbor Revisited_, edited by Robert W. Love, Jr. (London:  Macmillan, 1995) (ISBN 0312095937), and in more extended fashion in the same author's _Threshold of War: Franklin D. Roosevelt and American Entry into World War II_, (Oxford:  Oxford University Press, 1988) (ISBN 0195061683). For the same issue from a different perspective see Gerhard L. Weinberg,  \\"Global Conflict: The Interaction Between the European and Pacific Theaters of War in World War II,\\" in _Germany, Hitler, and World War II: Essays in Modern German and World History_, (Cambridge:  Cambridge University Press, 1995) (ISBN 0521474078), or his book, _A World at Arms: A Global History of World War II_, (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1994) (ISBN 0521558794).    Beginning with the Japanese occupation of Vietnam in July of 1941, thereby making manifest their determination to continue down the road of active alliance with Hitler, the U.S. began to rush all available military powerto the Philippines, reserving only that which was essential to the security of America itself. But years of penuriousness and neglect had left the cupboard largely bare, and re-armament was yet to produce major material results. So the Philippine defenders, like the exposed sentry, became casualties of the brutally inexorable logic of war. Brian Linn's book provides a major and largely-overlooked piece of this picture, but is somewhat weak on the overall context.    There are also other sources which the interested reader may wish to consult in order to get a fuller picture. These include John J. Stephan, _Hawaii Under the Rising Sun: Japan's Plans for Conquest After Pearl Harbor_, (Honolulu: University of Hawai'i Press, 1984) (0824825500) and the article by Richard B. Meixsel, \\"Major General George Grunert, WPO-3, and the Philippine Army, 1940-1941,\\" _Journal of Military History_, 59, No. 2 (Apr 1995): 303-24. Both offer insights not fully captured by Linn. In a more recent article, \\"Manuel L. Quezon, Douglas MacArthur, and the Significance of the Military Mission to the Philippine Commonwealth,\\" _Pacific Historical Review_, 70, No. 2: 255-92, Meixsel introduces some new evidence regarding the events in the Philippines in the 1930s and uses it to call into question some of Linn's claims.    While I have focused on its limitations, I want to emphasize again that this is a very valuable and unique book, even taking them fully into account.	2005-03-30

It is not cheap, of course, but it saved me many hours of digging through archives, not to mention the time spent getting to them. <br /> <br />The main chapters cover: 1. USMC organizational profile; 2. USMC shore establishment; 3. Fleet Marine Force (FMF); 4. Amphibious corps and forces -- Marine divisions, brigades, and tactical groups (including a summary of the history and actions of each); 5. FMF ground units (including a brief summary of the history and actions of each regiment and significant independent unit); 6. FMF ground unit operations (brief description of each major action, with order of battle on both sides and summary of results, including one or more maps for most); 7. USMC aviation profile; 8. USMC aviation units (to squadron and detachment level, with brief summary entry for each); 9. FMF aviation unit campaign participation. <br /> <br />There are useful appendixes covering the characteristics and utilization of weapons, aircraft, and landing ships and craft, as well as: a recap of USMC casualties; unit citations and commendations (as well as a statistical summary of individual awards); succinct but useful summary information on the U.S. Navy, U.S. Army, and Japanese forces; a listing of code names; and a comprehensive table of comparative rates and ranks. <br /> <br />As noted by another reviewer, the tables of organization are not always so detailed or complete as might be wished. Those who have been directly involved in military operations, however, will know that such tables always represent objectives rather than reality and that the actual organization is constantly in flux -- particularly so in war. One can get a detailed look at unit personnel strength (in most cases) by consulting the muster rolls (available on microfilm), but it is not practical to try to include all this information in a book even of this size.  <br /> <br />With its oversized (7\\"  10\\") page format and 600 text pages one would expect this book to pack a lot of information. The author manages to provide more even than might be expected by organizing the material well, which also makes it easy to find what you are looking for in this sea of data. Despite its \\"just the facts\\" orientation, readers will find many fascinating tid-bits. It is inevitable that in a book with this much information some bits will not be quite correct, but errors are few and inconsequential. <br /> <br />Most people probably neither need nor can afford this book for themselves, and the publisher has wisely positioned it as a library title. If you have any need or desire to study the Pacific War in depth, however, you will definitely want to urge your library to acquire it. This book is naturally complemented by Rottman's _World War II Pacific Island Guide : A Geo-Military Study_ (ISBN 0313313954), which provides details of the places where the Marines fought. <br /> <br />Will O'Neil	2005-02-06

US	53082016	R1163K8DV7W70W	0709023707	257644857	Knight in History	Books	5	32	33	N	Y	Highly readable, thoroughly researched	It would be pretty hard to find a better concise history of European knighthood than this book by Frances Gies. Her research is very thorough and she understands the Medieval world well. At the same time, she brings her subjects alive and never lets her erudition intrude to interrupt the flow of the story. In little more than 200 pages of well-written text she traces the whole arc of the knight's history, from Charlemagne to the end of the Hundred Years War -- and beyond into the long twilight of knighthood down to the Victorian era. <br />  <br /> After tracing the origins of knighthood she gives a vivid description of the First Crusade. Then she turns to the troubadours and the development of the literature of knighthood, as well as its impact on the knights themselves. Next she takes up the career of a very notable knight of the second half of the 12th century, William Marshal in an account filled with details that reveal his character and that of knighthood in his time. The story of the remaining Crusades is organized around an account of the crusading orders, particularly the Knights Templar. Next comes a vivid mini-bio of one of the most remarkable characters of history, the mid-14th century French knight and commander Bertrand Du Guesclin. Then the story of Sir John Fastolf, a major English commander of the 15th century (only very tenuously related to Shakespeare's Falstaff) nicely illustrates the transition between the world of knightly warfare and that of armies on the modern pattern. A final chapter traces the lingering influence of knighthood in early modern Europe. <br />  <br /> There are many well-chosen black-and-white illustrations, extensive source notes, and a good bibliography. <br />  <br /> The book addresses the knight's armor and fighting techniques, but only briefly. Combats and battles, too, are treated largely in schematic fashion. The focus is on the knight's character, his views of himself and his world, and his place in his society. There is also a clear summary of the overall development of the patterns of Medieval warfare. <br />  <br /> Although there is some mention of knighthood elsewhere, the book concentrates very strongly on England and France; treatments of Southern and Central Europe of comparable quality would be very welcome. Gies does not have an ideological slant or a theory to defend -- she neither &quot;debunks&quot; nor extolls. Since the book's writing, two decades ago, further evidence has been discovered which naturally alters some details, but on the whole the book holds up very well.	2004-08-01

She shows that the concept of honor was central to the samurai throughout their history, but also demonstrates that their concepts of honor changed greatly. The samurai are presented not as distant, inscrutable creatures of a mysterious culture but as human beings constructing and living within a society adapted to their needs and circumstances. Their combination of ferocity and refinement are made comprehensible.<br />Along the way she presents important and insightful analyses of such familiar aspects of samurai life as ritual suicide, bushido, the _Hagakure_, and the story of the revenge of the 47 ronin. <br />The book begins with a section in which Ikegami sets out her analytical structure and theses. This may seem dry to some, but it is important in introducing concepts that run through the subsequent narrative. The bulk of the book consists of a chronologically arranged history of the development of samurai society, based in a wide range of Japanese and western sources. <br />The book is well written and has many touches to aid the reader (such as reminders of the meanings of key Japanese terms and avoidance of unexplained jargon). Nevertheless, the density of the argument and facts demand careful and thoughtful reading.<br />As the title should suggest, this is not a book for the novice, unfamiliar with the broad outlines of Japanese history. Nor is it a military history of the samurai. <br />Will O'Neil	2004-06-18

They survey the diplomatic history of the interwar period very clearly and concisely, summarizing the internal political factors underlying the diplomatic moves. In the course of their book they provide a good and unprejudical review of the major views on key points. The treatment of the European and Asian ends of the story is well integrated -- far more so than in most accounts, which tend to concentrate on one end or the other and lose a great deal of coherence in the process. And they provide a good brief introduction to the historiography. The text is much enlivened by deft and judicious use of brief quotations from participants.<br />It is not at all possible, of course, to cover the story of the war's origins comprehensively and in depth in 200 pages of text. Many of the details and nuances of the diplomatic history are lost, the treatment of political factors is fairly sketchy, that of the economic factors still more so, and there is essentially nothing on the social factors. There are also a few lacunae, as when a few of the many people mentioned in the text are brought in without specifying who they were, what positions they held, or why they were important.<br />Overall, however, this has to rate as the best brief introduction to this richly complex and still relevant period.<br />Will O'Neil	2004-05-06

In fact, however, Stephen Budiansky's book, is an extremely impressive accomplishment -- it is hard to imagine that anyone could do it better. It is very thoroughly researched and sets a high standard for accuracy and thoroughness, but never gets bogged down in the details. Budiansky fashions his immense collection of data into a coherent and fascinating story, alive with real people and vivid action. There is always a sense of purpose and direction to his narrative and the reader never feels lost.<br />The high quality of the research and writing is matched by the quality of the book's production. Its nearly 100 photos are well selected and very finely reproduced on high-grade glossy stock. Budiansky's concise, clear, and accurate explanations of battles and technologies are illustrated with well-drawn maps and diagrams. As specific aircraft are discussed, they are represented in the margins in clear drawings and basic data. Rather than clutter the text with footnotes, the extensive references are collected at the end, in a format which makes it easy to locate the source of every quotation and important piece of information. A bibliography of more than 500 items testifies to the author's thoroughness as well as providing easy routes to finding additional information. In every way, this is a great deal of book for the money, particularly at Amazon's price.<br />Books about air power seem as common as clouds, and most have about as much substance. This one is a great exception, a volume packed with solid information, presented in a consistently clear and interesting manner.<br />Will O'Neil<br />PS. As a matter of full disclosure I should note that I am mentioned among Budiansky's acknowledgements. In reality, I played a very modestrole in it, restricted to providing some research information and advice. It is in no sense my book, and I would not hesitate to criticize it if criticism were warranted. It is not.	2004-05-01

Kelley covers the \\"big three\\" systems: Germany's Enigma; the Japanese diplomatic cipher machine known by its codename, PURPLE; and the U.S. Army-Navy ECM/SIGABA. He tells us how each was developed and by whom, how it worked and how it was used, and how and why it was (or, in the case of SIGABA, never was) broken. Without elaborate mathematics he makes the principles of these machines and their solutions clear and also evaluates their strengths and weaknesses.<br />As the author shows, each of these machines had the potential to be unbreakable with the resources available to cryptologists at that time. But those who implemented the German and Japanese systems and set and checked their operating procedures left holes that codebreakers could drive solutions through, and did. In the U.S., however, some of the world's best cryptanalysts were given the freedom not only to design the SIGABA machine but to develop and control all the details of its use. As a result it was never broken even though it was very widely used for almost two decades and generated vast amounts of ciphertext. <br />I was particularly interested in the description of how the U.S. Army and Navy cryptologists devised SIGABA and broke PURPLE. They were less colorful and romantic than many of their British counterparts -- civil servants and military officers who worked in the shadows -- but they were giants. Some authors have slighted their accomplishments on the grounds that the PURPLE system was not very strong and the German and Japanese cryptologists given the task of breaking SIGABA were not as good as the Poles and British who broke Enigma. But Kelley shows how great the challenges of PURPLE truly were, and how really unbreakable SIGABA was. While PURPLE was less strong than Enigma in some respects, the playing field was leveled because the Poles and British had a lot inside knowledge about Enigma that was totally denied to the Americans attacking PURPLE. PURPLE was a pure cryptanalytical solution with no prior knowledge of the machine's mechanism -- the first of its kind and an amazing feat. Nor did it really matter how good or bad the Axis cryptologists were -- the way the U.S. used SIGABA, it was never going to be broken.<br />The book's writing is lively and clear and its illustrations, although sparse, are well chosen. It is fairly expensive, not at all grandly produced, and relatively brief. But if you really want to know how World War cipher systems worked and didn't, you cannot pass this book up.<br />Will O'Neil	2003-02-11

Read my review of it and you will see why I say this. I cannot recommend the Harries' book at all now, not even as a supplement. Don't waste your time.   I'm retaining my original 2003 review, below, because it still has some useful pointers:  This British husband-wife history-writing team have produced a serviceable popular narrative history of the Japanese Army (which, as they do not note, only became \\"Imperial\\" after 1930). It's a field in which there is no great competition and their work has the merit of being fairly comprehensive and quite readable. Most of it comes from rehashing of well-known (and often not very strong) secondary sources, but they seem to have mined British War Office papers pretty thoroughly, resulting in some interesting tidbits. They mention having journeyed to Japan and consulted Japanese sources, but these don't seem to have played a very prominent role. There are a number of errors regarding well-known facts, and no significant analysis.  A brief, sound, readable summary of Japanese army history is provided by Alvin Coox in his article \\"The Japanese Army Experience,\\" from Russell Weigley (ed.), _New Dimensions in Military History_ (Presidio, 1975).  For a comprehensive work in English on the Japanese Army in World War II, see _Kogun: The Japanese Army in the Pacific War_, by Saburo Hayashi and Alvin Coox. (It is out of print and hard to find, but a text file is available on the Web.) Virtually anything written by Alvin Coox on the subject is well worth reading, and particularly his article \\"The Pacific War\\" in Vol. 6 of _The Cambridge History of Japan_. Coox's _Year of the Tiger_, (unfortunately also out of print) is valuable for the army in the China Incident, and his _Nomonhan: Japan Against Russia, 1939_ (available from Amazon) is a masterful study not only of this critical campaign but of the entire Japanese Army experience in Manchuria. For an understanding of the Japanese Army as an institution, see Leonard Humphreys, _The Way of the Heavenly Sword: The Japanese Army in the 1920's_ (available from Amazon) as well as Shin'ichi Kitaoka, \\"The Army as a Bureaucracy: Japanese Militarism Revisited,\\" _J.

That is true of some books, but not of this one. The author, a distinguished U.S. Army infantry officer with a history Ph.D., has really produced a history of the entire development of the service between the world wars. It makes a fascinating and often pretty colorful story, and it does a great deal to explain the Army's successes and failings in World War II. <br />Odom shows an army essentially paralyzed and left in a state of suspended animation from which it was aroused only on the brink of war. Remembering the agonizing difficulties of raising, training, and equipping a mass army after America's entry into World War I, the Army's leaders and their civilian masters placed first priority on an expansible force. At the same time, shortsightedly pennypinching Republican administrations in the 1920s and the first FDR administration's absorption in the Depression kept military expenditures and manning meager. The handful of Regulars who remained after meeting needs for deployed forces in China, the Philippines, the Canal Zone, Hawaii, and on the Mexican border were scattered across America to train Guard and Reserve forces. What little money the Army had for R&D and equipment procurement went almost entirely to an Air Corps with little interest in supporting the ground forces it wanted only to break away from. With widely scattered forces, no modern equipment, and no money for \\"luxuries\\" like transportation, the rare exercises amounted to little more than musters. <br />Deprived of the stimulus of real-world experience in the field and muffled by senior officers and civilians unwilling to hear critical or even novel views, the Army's officers were left with little but their memories of World War I to guide them, with the natural result that the service remained backward-looking. Had the United States been drawn into World War II in 1939 or 1940 rather than late in 1941, it would have found the Army catastrophically unprepared -- not simply in terms of manpower and matériel but in ideas about how to organize and fight. Bad as the Army's condition was in December of 1941, it vastly better than it had been two years before. <br />All of this is made vividly clear in this well written and well structured book. Some may feel that the author pulls his punches a little bit with respect to the responsibility of the Army's own leaders. As he makes clear, they found themselves in a very difficult corner. But I think it is fair to say that they could have prepared the Army somewhat better had they been more willing to make and defend painful tradeoffs within the limited resources they were granted. (For instance, unmentioned by Odom, the Army spent relatively substantial sums on construction of buildings in the mid to late 1930s -- badly needed, to be sure, but how badly compared to other things?) Still, Odom provides us with much of the information needed to make up our own minds on these issues. <br />I found this book both valuable and enjoyable. I would recommend pairing it with David E. Johnson's _Fast Tanks and Heavy Bombers: Innovation in the U.S. Army, 1917-1945_ (Cornell U. Press, 1998), which complements it in many ways. Hopefully, Odom's publishers will follow the lead of Johnson's in issuing an affordable paperbound edition. When they do so, they might consider dropping the \\"doctrine\\" from the subtitle; it will still be strictly accurate, and less likely to confuse non-professional readers.<br />Will O'Neil	2003-01-31

Bix, is an American who has long taught in Japan. I know him only by reputation, but his reputation doesn't inspire me to much confidence in his work. He is known as an adherent of the neo-Marxist historiography that continues to have a vogue in Japanese academic circles. To me, his book seems to show its stamp quite clearly. <br />Here are a few quotes from reviews in respected journals (rather than the advertising-influenced popular press) by people with strong reputations as scholars of modern Japanese history:<br />\\"Superbly written, meticulously researched, and vigorously advertised.... Other historians, examining more or less the same material, reached different conclusions. ... All the rescripts, edicts, and declarations of the emperor, which Bix quotes extensively and to which he attaches great importance, were composed by the cabinet or other government organs. All the appointments he `made' had been decided in advance by others and `humbly submitted' to him for approval. All the military orders he `issued' had been formulated by the armed forces and presented to him for signature. On some occasions his personal views were taken into consideration, but except for August 1945, he was never expected to make a major decision. ... The author accepts the evidence that fits his theory, but discards that which contradicts it. He believes Konoe that Hirohito endorsed the views of the military, but does not believe him that the emperor wished to avoid war (pp. 419-20). He believes Hirohito's admission, in the Monologue, that one of his motives for ending the war was to preserve the dynasty, but does not believe hint that his main motive was to save the people (p. 515 ) . When evidence is lacking, innuendo is used.\\" -- Ben-Ami Shillony, _Journal of Japanese Studies_, 28,1 (Winter 2002): 141-146.<br />\\"Herbert Bix's book is a welcome contribution whether or not one agrees with his interpretations. ... Nor does he cite authors ... whose interpretations, based on documentary evidence that Bix ignores, differ from his own. ... Bix exaggerates Hirohito's importance. His own narrative account is at odds with his emphasis on Hirohito as the key decision maker because it shows the great extent to which the emperor was constrained by the bureaucratic monarchy within which he operated.\\" -- Stephen S. Large, _Monumenta Nipponica_, 56, 1 (Spring 2001): 107-110.<br />\\"Bix is amply justified in accentuating Hirohito's active enthusiasm and engagement as supreme commander and in identifying his continued belligerence as a significant source of pressure on Japanese generals and admirals. But Bix clearly overstates the degree to which the emperor was able to initiate or precipitate changes in national policy.... His ambitious claims ... depend upon a very liberal reading of evidence that comes almost entirely from second-hand accounts.... The degree to which Bix recklessly outpaces his sources can perhaps best be summed up by the juxtaposition of a candid admission with a bold declaration. Without further elaboration, he proclaims, `Though no documents directly tie him to it, another feature of the brutal China war for which Hirohito should be charged with personal responsibility was the strategic bombing of Chungking and other cities.' ... Bix's daring in argument is also, unfortunately, reflected in the mechanics of this book. Mistransliterations abound here, and footnotes supporting controversial statements of fact or interpretation often point simply to other secondary sources.\\" -- Frederick R. Dickinson, _Orbis_, 45, 4 (Fall 2001): 637-647.<br />(Some will criticize me, in turn, for not citing the much more favorable reviews of Marxist historians; I will leave that to others.)<br />These are only very brief snippets from much longer and deeper reviews, but as they suggest the general picture is of a book that has definite merits but which must be read carefully and knowledgably. If you are already quitefamiliar with Japan's history in the Taisho and Showa periods (so that you can tell where Bix omits or distorts important facts that are inconvenient for his argument) and want a fuller picture of Hirohito (and particularly of his early life) then the book will prove valuable. But if you are looking for a good introduction to the period and its issues, or to the emperor himself, look further.<br />The role of Hirohito in Japan's history as its Showa Emperor was a largely inglorious one, especially up to August of 1945. But to put the blame for Japan's ruinous course to and through World War II so squarely on his slight shoulders, as Bix does, not only distorts history but serves as a smokescreen to conceal its lessons for today. We have buried Hirohito, but the forces that propelled Japan into an awful and catastrophic war continue to stalk our world today. If we are deceived by the casuistry of Herbert Bix and his ilk, they will roam free to spawn new generations of demons.<br />Will O'Neil	2003-01-26

It is well and clearly written and generally quite strong in its sources. It is not the first book one should read about interwar Japan and its march to war, since it really does not present a rounded view of Japanese politics and the army as an institution. But for someone who understands the general background, it is fascinating and useful. <br />One caution: in common with many books written by specialists in Japanese history, it presents a very distorted picture of the mindset and actions of the Roosevelt administration. The central problem is an implicit assumption that Japan was the central concern when in fact its importance to FDR and his lieutenants lay in its relationship to the problem of Hitler. Deprived of this context, the actions of the administration are truly inexplicable. <br />Will O'Neil	2003-01-05

The original volume is quite hard to find and this inexpensive reprint is very welcome. Sternhell and Thorndike remains, after more than 55 years, a unique and highly valuable account of World War II antisubmarine warfare (ASW). Some of the data are incomplete or not fully accurate, owing to its publication before German and Japanese data had been fully weighed -- and also because some parts of the story (such as the impact of communications intelligence) could not then be included due to the relatively low level of classification. But the authors had played leading roles in U.S. Navy efforts to analyze ASW throughout the war and they lay out most crucial aspects of the ASW campaign with a clarity and precision that no subsequent book has even approached. Their treatment is not highly technical -- there is a little bit of mathematics, but nothing to daunt anyone who recalls even the barest rudiments of high school algebra. Most of the quantitative information is conveyed in clear tables, diagrams, and graphs. This book is essential reading, even today, for anyone who wants to understand ASW -- the ASW of World War II, or the ASW of today.<br />(Note: I am the Chief Scientist of the CNA Corp., a non-profit research and analysis institution that is the parent of the Operations Evaluation Group, still serving the nation more than 60 years after its founding at the beginning of World War II.)	2002-08-01

The maps are generally quite good in both accuracy and clarity. There is some regrettable sloppiness in the editing, however -- as when a table of dates has Muhammad entering Mecca rather than Medina in 622 (page 99)! There is a useful glossary and a good index. The balance is, as some have noted, tilted toward Europe, but this no doubt merely reflects the fact that serious historical research is essentially a European invention. For the most part the editors have done very well in terms of both spatial and temporal distribution. It is regrettable that there are no indications of sources, however, beyond a general bibliography.<br />To my mind, the strongest competition to this volume is offered by the Penguin history atlas series authored by Colin McEvedy. McEvedy is much better on historical narrative and generally stronger on facts, but his books do not extend to every place and era, his coverage being strongest in Europe and especially weak in Asia. I wouldn't give up either this volume or the McEvedy books.<br />One thing which may confuse people in Amazon's listing of this book is that Geoffrey Parker is given as the lead editor. In fact, he edited the fourth edition and seems to have had nothing specifically to do with this fifth edition. The title page lists Geoffrey Barraclough and Richard Overy, and makes clear that the revision of this edition was Overy's work.	2002-02-02

People who would prefer a more abstract, deeper, or more condensed treatment will do well to look elsewhere, but Friedman's book is very good of its kind. It is lively, clear, and well written. Above all, it is reasonably thorough and quite well balanced. While Friedman believes that globalization is generally a good thing, he is aware of the many concerns and doubts about the phenomenon and treats them well.

As far as I know, it is the most comprehensive history of aerodynamics and its relationship to aircraft development. Speaking as someone who has been involved technically in aircraft design, I found it truly fascinating to learn how today's techniques and base of knowledge evolved through the interaction of theory, experiment, and engineering experience. I believe that this book will interest anyone who wants to understand how aircraft design has evolved and why airplanes were designed as they were at various times and places.<br />It is, as the title says, strictly about aerodynamics and does not cover many other matters of vital importance to aircraft design, such as structure, mass properties (like the inertial moments mentioned by another reviewer), propulsion, or systems. Moreover, it's about the principles of aerodynamics and does not cover many of the important aspects of its application to aircraft, such as propulsion system integration. Thus it is not by any means a comprehensive history of aircraft design and development. But it treats its one topic of the development of the principles of aerodynamics for aircraft very well.<br />The book does not assume any real technical knowledge of aerodynamics, although I imagine it could be somewhat tough going for someone who had no prior knowledge of the subject at all. There is a sprinkling of equations and a few mathematical arguments, but no one should be put off by them because (1) they are not complex (no calculus) and (2) you can skip over them if you are willing to take the author's word on what they mean. From my perspective, the author does a good job of explaining concepts clearly and correctly. He does not insult the expert's intelligence, while remaining accessible to those without deep knowledge. More technical details are given in appendices.<br />Of course it is impossible in any single book to cover all important developments in aircraft aerodynamics. This book is definitely slanted toward the fundamentals -- the Wright brothers don't appear until nearly halfway through the book. The author, himself an authority on modern aerodynamics, only very briefly sketches developments of the past 50 years, on the grounds that they are too much a story in progress to make for concise history.<br />For readers used to thinking of the US as the world leader in airplane development and manufacture, it may come as a surprise to learn how often America trailed behind in the development of aerodynamics and how fortunate Americans were to have escaped the worst consequences of their nation's past (and recent) neglect of research in this vital area. In light of the book's emphasis on this, it was a little surprising to find another reviewer criticizing it as too slanted toward US developments. In leafing through the index I see a strong preponderance of names from outside the US. In order to keep the book to \\"only\\" 450 pages of text, however, the author does often concentrate on the main theme in a given area and does not cite all of the parallel and supporting work elsewhere, leading to neglect of some non-US (and some US) efforts.<br />I particularly liked the way the book puts a human face on the story by giving brief biographical summaries of the people who have played key roles in aerodynamics development and sketching the times and circumstances in which they worked.<br />Readers hoping for a brief (and somewhat impressionistic) introduction rather than Anderson's more comprehensive approach may want to look up Theodore von K&aacute;rm&aacute;n's _Aerodynamics_ (1954) or John E. Allen's _Aerodynamics: A space age survey_ (1966). The standard broad surveys of the development of aircraft design and technology are Ronald Miller & David Sawers, _The Technical Development of Modern Aviation_ (1970) and Laurence K.

However, the little he does say about technology is mostly well informed, at least up to 1945 -- he has avoided the technological know-nothingism of many of the others who write on such subjects. He served as a junior naval officer and this background seems to stand him in good stead in forming his judgements about people and events.    The principal theme is the rise and evolution of ideas about battleships and their rivals for naval dominance. There are no profound new insights here, but on the whole McBride does a good job with his subject. He elaborates the picture in important respects and has many thoughtful observations to offer.     McBride sometimes is rather quick to impute motives to individuals and groups without much substantiation or consideration of alternative hypotheses. No doubt he is correct in most of these judgements, and he is less summary than many authors on these subjects have been, but I personally would have preferred a somewhat more measured approach.    Unfortunately, his prose can be off-putting at some times, due to his fondness for clothing fundamentally common-sensical concepts in obscurantist academic jargon. Fortunately, there is not too much of this and most of the book is reasonably readable.     One regrettable distortion comes in his somewhat tortured discussion of the naval arms limitations treaties (the Five Power Treaty of 1921 and its 1930 and 1936 London Treaty sequels). Although it has little to do with his ostensible subject, McBride ventures into judgments regarding the effects of various U.S. actions on opinion in Japan and the Imperial Japanese Navy, apparently without having consulted some of the most important scholarship on the subject. For instance, I can find no citation of his to James Crowley's book, Japan's Quest for Autonomy, with its extended and authoritative treatment of the U.S. as well as Japanese side of the London Treaties. Nor does he cite David Evans' and Mark Peattie's essential study of the Japanese Navy, Kaigun. These sources, based in extensive Japanese-language primary research, paint quite a different picture than McBride favors regarding the impact of the U.S. naval expansion of the 1930s on Japanese Navy views, relative to other influences. This is a self-inflicted wound: if he was unable to conduct more thorough research in the issue, peripheral as it is to his main point, McBride could perfectly well have avoided forming judgements regarding it without loss to his main arguments.    I puzzled over McBride's bald assertion that \\"the [rigid] airship could have succeeded,\\" citing its supposed high search rate. He does make one citation to a book that examines this question in some detail and comes to quite different conclusions (Richard Smith's The Airships Akron & Macon), but seems to have relied principally on other sources. Few who have studied the issue carefully would agree with him -- some years ago, two of the last of Goodyear's rigid airship engineers disagreed flatly with him in the course of an extended discussion I had with them regarding proposals for reviving the technology.    It is understandable that there is no reference to the recent study by Thomas Hone, Norman Friedman, and Mark Mandeles, American & British Aircraft Carrier Development, 1919-1941 -- no doubt McBride's book was already in press by the time it appeared. Nevertheless, this is unfortunate, as their insights and evidence would have enriched McBride's work significantly in some areas.    In his final chapter, McBride ranges far beyond the period he set for himself, attempting not only to draw sweeping conclusions but to provide policy recommendations. Regrettably, this is the weakest part of the book. He is too ready to pronounce conclusions without careful analysis and without having developed strong evidence or given adequate consideration to alternative hypotheses. His treatment of recent developments often seems quite ill-informed and many of his confidently-asserted predictions seem dubious or even silly in light of what has transpired since the book was written. And he indulges especially in dense academic jargon in this section. Most readers will want to skip this chapter, and will retain a better opinion of the book for having done so.    Notwithstanding some lacunae, however, on the whole this is a valuable study of the process by which the U.S. Navy adapted itself to changing technology and needs in the period between the Civil War and World War II.

As his title indicates, author David Johnson traces two main themes: the Army's responses to the challenges and opportunities presented by the airplane and tank. He shows that these responses, although very different, were both seriously inadequate in ways that proved very costly in the test of war -- and he shows why and how these inadequacies developed. Johnson, a former professional Army officer and National War College instructor, is not dedicated to any theoretical framework. He tells the story very clearly and directly, relying on deep research in primary sources, and draws his lessons from the events as they occurred. He understands the people and the institutions and organizations within which they acted, and he views them sympathetically but dispassionately and objectively.<br />The story Johnson tells is not one of inevitable historical forces but of human decisions. The decisions were made under the influence of institutions and events, but were not determined by them. They were not catastrophic, but they were well short of optimum. Many Americans died as a result of deficiencies that could well have been avoided.<br />Because it does not tie the story up in a neat theoretical package, Johnson's book offers no canned recipe for success in responding to present and future challenges and opportunities. Instead, it provides a rich source of inspiration and caution, and a stimulus to thought.<br />There are a few disappointments, although minor in comparison to the book's strengths: (1) I would have liked to have seen a deeper analysis of the part played by technological factors. While we are too often treated to on-dimensional purely technological approaches to such questions, I feel Johnson goes a bit too far in the other direction. (2) Johnson's citation system for sources, while adequate for a brief article, becomes frustratingly cumbersome at book length. It is too often a real struggle to unearth exactly what his source for a given point is.<br />Another book that can profitably be read as a complement to this one is William O. Odom's _After the Trenches: The Tranformation of U.S. Army Doctrine, 1918-1939_ (Texas A&M U. Press, 1999).<br />Will O'Neil	2001-11-02

In little more than 250 pages, Beasley has managed a remarkably clear overview of the development of Japan's entire external policy from the beginning of the 19th century to the end of the Second World War. In the process, he pays careful attention to the internal political and economic dynamics that propelled policy, and thus lays out a great deal of the story of the development of modern Japan up through 1945. While always making his own views (and the bases for them) quite clear, he gives alternative interpretations their due. Although more recent work has extended the story in certain respects (e.g., Frederick R. Dickinson's fine War and National Reinvention), Beasley's work still stands the test of time. Remarkably, for a so brief a book treating so broad a topic, Beasley manages to organize and present his story in a way that should be easy to follow even for those who do not have much background in Japanese history. An especially good book, strongly recommended.	2001-09-29

Anyone approaching Japanese history for the first time would do very well to start with this book. Those who know the story well already will nevertheless find many delights. The book is good reading and explains the intricacies of Japanese history with remarkable clarity. Jansen treats the social and cultural as well as political and economic sides, and integrates them into a coherent whole. When reading more specialized accounts, I find myself referring back to Jansen's book as a convenient way to put their stories in context. The illustrations are well chosen and well presented. Strongly recommended.	2001-09-29

Frederick Dickinson's book stands many accepted truths on their heads. But it is not a book of wooly revisionist speculation. All of his arguments and interpretations are carefully drawn and meticulously documented. All are thought-provoking and plausible, and most seem to me entirely convincing. <br />As realist theory would predict, there were few prominent leaders who failed to support Japanese expansion in the favorable circumstances offered by the European conflict. But there was a very crucial divide between those who looked to British-model expansionism of a primarily economic sort and those seeking military-led territorial expansion on the model of Wilhelmine Germany. The struggle for power among (and within) these camps is one major theme of the book. The other is the response of Japanese elites to the wholesale change in the structure of international relations brought by the War, and its domestic correlates. As it shifted from a European power struggle to a world crusade against totalitarianism and the use of force to change the international order, World War I attacked the very foundations of the Meiji state. <br />I hope that those who (like me) have only slight knowledge of Japanese history will not be put off this book. It is inevitably somewhat dense, but Dickinson avoids academic obscurity, introduces his characters carefully, and pauses frequently for reflection and summary. His concluding chapter ties all his strands together and places the story in a larger context. His contention that it is a vital key to understanding everything in modern Japanese history rings true to me. The book does not require great effort to read, and what effort there is will be well repaid. <br />There is a wonderful bonus in the book's rich trove of Japanese political cartoons from the period. These speak in a mordant voice thatwas, tragically, to fall silent as democracy was smothered in the 1930s. They add a great deal to the book. <br />No doubt many will look at the subtitle, &quot;Japan in the Great War,&quot; and conclude that this is too specialized a topic to engage them. In doing so, however, they will miss an important book whose interest extends far beyond the specifics of its subject.	2001-09-11

The approach is physical rather than purely mathematical. A good background in electromagnetics is needed for full mastery of the material, but a more limited knowledge of electricity and magnetism will still allow good basic comprehension. Even full mastery of the book won't make you a qualified RCS engineer, but it provides a good basis for further study as well as an excellent resource for those who need an overall design and technology perspective, or must communicate clearly with specialists. I've consulted it over and over in the 15 years since I acquired a copy of the first edition. The second edition has important improvements, although the first edition remains useful in many areas.<br />Will O'Neil	2001-09-04

I got a very wonderful surprise. Katrin Eismann deals with only one (very important) application of Photoshop, but she really DEALS with it. I'm finding it easy to follow her steps, understand the logic behind her approaches, and apply her techniques to my own images.<br />It's not a book for absolute Photoshop beginners because she assumes that you know where to find the tools and palettes. But you certainly don't need to be an expert user to get a lot out of it -- I'm not, and I have. One thing I like is that she shows two or more ways to attack most problems and gives you a good sense of the tradeoffs between them.<br />The book I'd compare this with most closely is Barry Haynes &amp; Wendy Crumpler, Photoshop 5.5 Artistry. (I'm eagerly awaiting the new, Photoshop 6 edition.) Both are really wonderful. Haynes will do more for your all-round mastery of Photoshop, but Eismann is better on the very specific area she covers. Eismann's book is also a little easier to absorb because she takes things in somewhat smaller bites. On the other hand, the beauty of some of the things Haynes does may be a bit more inspiring. Buy both, if you can afford them.	2001-06-02

Adelman, 1962-1993	Books	5	8	9	N	N	Simply the best there is on oil econ	If you know anything of significance about the economics of petroleum, the name M. A. Adelman will already be familiar. If you know nothing and want to learn, this book is the place to start; it will take you a very long way.<br />Even though some of the papers in this book are approaching their 40th birthdays, all remain fresh and relevant. Adelman virtually invented the serious study of petroleum economics and even his earliest insights are worthwhile.<br />This book is also essential reading for anyone interested in the economics of resources more broadly. While I don't think that Adelman has spoken quite the last word on the so-called Hotelling theory of the economics of &quot;exhaustible resources&quot;, he makes far more sense on the subject than most of his colleagues.<br />It also has much that is of value to students of non-petroleum commodities. Petroleum is a very special kind of commodity, but there are many lessons from it that apply elsewhere. Anyone still tempted by the notion of the benificent price-stabilizing cartel -- the UNCTAD model -- should read and ponder what Adelman has to say about how OPEC actually has (mal)functioned.<br />Adelman's style can be a bit quirky and discursive, but never obscure or dry. It's a big book because there's so much in it, not because it's padded out with academic belaborings. There is a little repetition becuase it's a collection, but not too much.<br />Much may at first seem somewhat strange. That's simply because Adelman's facts and analysis don't support a lot of conventional wisdom about petroleum. Don't be put off by the contradictions. You'll find everything documented and referenced, so you can decide for yourself where Adelman's facts come from. (Moreover, he usually summarizes the positions he's attacking clearly and fairly.) Look at what he has to say and measure it against what you may have assumed or been led to believe. Even if you don't come to agree with him on every point, I think you'll find everything he says to be illuminating and stimulating.	2001-05-06

Especially clear explanations of how it all worked. This is not &quot;cryptology for drooling idiots,&quot; but with a little attention you can follow the details without knowing anything about group theory. I really liked the material about the development of mechanical methods for sorting and correlating -- poorly covered in most accounts.<br />Sticks to documented facts and steers clear of speculation and hearsay, which may be part of why the book seems slightly light on the Pacific side. But if you like your history factual, clear, and well-written, this is an excellent book.<br />It's no accident that it sells well in Virginia and Maryland!	2001-02-27
US	53082016	R3RV445XQAHFDM	1853752924	583208760	The Genius of China: 3,000 Years of Science, Discovery and Invention	Books	3	91	106	N	Y	Attractive but very odd and somewhat disappointing	This book is a compendium of interesting Chinese innovations in science and technology, scattered across several millennia of history, attractively illustrated and for the most part clearly described. There are no references to which one can turn for more information on specific topics. It's an antiquarian's book - - a bit in the spirit often seen among Chinese antiquarians, in fact.     What it is not, unfortunately, is a coherent history of the development of Chinese thought and practice in science and technology. Nor does it provide a well-founded account of how Chinese science and technology influenced and was influenced by other societies.    There is a brief but graceful and interesting introductory essay by the late Dr. Joseph Needham, FRS, the notable biologist who developed a great enthusiasm for Chinese scientific and technological history and authored a remarkable multi-volume survey, Science and Civilisation in China.    The author of the present work unfortunately repeats and greatly compounds the worst weaknesses of Needham's history, with exactly the opposite effect to that he intends. If he knows of no early European examples of a particular development (which often is simply because of gaps in his knowledge of the relevant history) then he automatically ascribes the eventual European development to diffusion from Chinese sources. This is \\"post hoc ergo propter hoc\\" run amok, and the logical fallacy is transparent even to those readers who know little of the historical facts. In many cases it is indeed likely that diffusion was important for European development, but by his summary treatment of the causal issue, the author will lead many to doubt it.    One sifnificant example shows what is at work here. Temple (on pp. 55) tells us rather breathlessly that the Chinese were using water power to operate blast furnace bellows by AD 31 -- a genuinely significant achievement worthy of note. Then he claims that European metallurgical use of water power didnot come until the 12th century, when water powered hammer forges. Finally he jumps to the conclusion that the innovation traveled from China to Europe and was a major factor in the European Industrial Revolution.    The problem with this is that he simply has his facts altogether wrong with respect to Europe. Water power (for agricultural uses) dates probably to the 2nd or 3rd century BC in Europe. By the 1st century AD it was being used in mining and metallurgy, and by the 2nd century widely so. Thus water power appeared at least as early in Europe as in China, and perhaps a good deal earlier. Moreover, it was used far more widely for agricultural purposes, where Chinese techniques remained resolutely manpower-intensive up until very recently. (Indeed, Temple's book, with unconscious irony, shows many photos of human-powered machines in use in China during the modern era.)    This sort of distortion occurs repeatedly throughout the book -- it would be easy to document scores if not hundreds of instances.    (For books documenting Greek and Roman technological developments, search in Amazon for the following ISBNs: 041594189X, 0804748055, and 0801414393.)    Study of the history of Chinese innovation is extremely important at many levels for a clear understanding of the mechanisms of technological and social change. Unfortunately, this book does more to retard than to advance it.	2000-10-30

I've owned copies of both editions of William Orvis's wonderful book and if he revises it again, I'll be first in line for a copy of the third edition. He begins with a general overview of Excel as a scientific and  engineering calculation and graphing tool, assuming very little knowledge  of Excel and only basic undergrad math skills. It's no book for  &quot;dummies,&quot; but anyone of reasonable intelligence and clarity of  mind will have no difficulty in following what he says here. There are lots  of well-explained examples, and the CD which comes with the book makes it  easy to reproduce them without laborious data entry. Then he gives a brief  survey of Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) -- VBA light, but enough to  do many useful things. Next come chapters on data base functions, curve  fitting, and series models. After a chapter on numerical differentiation  and integration in general, the author deals with techniques for finding  roots of nonlinear equations, solving sets of linear and nonlinear  equations, and integrating ordinary and partial differential equations.  While the book is oriented toward Excel 7 for Win 95, no one is likely to  find it at all difficult to apply what it says directly in working with  later versions or those running under other OSs. There are lots of topics  I'd like to see added, or treated in greater depth, but the author could  scarcely have covered more in a single 500-page book, and I have no quarrel  with the balance he has chosen. None of the other science- or  engineering-oriented Excel books even approach this one in value and  coverage -- I've read them all. Excel is no substitute for Mathematica or  even MathCad, but this book gave me an entirely different appreciation for  the strengths it does offer for analyzing data. This is a book I recommend  not only to engineers and &quot;hard&quot; scientists but to anyone with a  need for rigorous data analysis.	2000-01-22

Globalizing Capital: A History of the International Monetary System is  better described by its subtitle than its title, but even that fails to  suggest just how up-to-the-minute it is. This book really provides a  crucial key for unlocking the puzzles of today's global financial crisis.  It tells the whole story of how the gold standard worked, how the Bretton  Woods system worked -- and why and how they stopped working. If you wonder  what the differences between floating and fixed exchange rates really are,  this book will tell you, in all dimensions. It shows very clearly that the  international financial crisis we see today is a great deal like what has  happened at some times in the past, and it explains what worked, what  didn't, and why in the past in dealing with similar crises. The author's  entirely non-ideological -- where there are two intellectually-respectable  sides to an issue, he presents both, explains why he comes down as he does,  and tells you where to look for more information. The book is brief (about  200 pages), well and clearly written, and doesn't assume that you know much  about economics or banking. There's a nice glossary in the back which  explains all those mysterious terms you hear about these days. I understand  that the new paperback edition has been updated to carry the story right up  through the Asia crisis. <br />W. D. O'Neil	1998-10-06
US	53082016	R34SNF6QERHU9V	0801483115	625169852	Bombing to Win: Air Power and Coercion in War (Cornell Studies in Security Affairs)	Books	5	45	47	N	N	Best study by far of what bombing can/can't accomplish	I found this book both stimulating in itself and relevant to many current and near-future issues. I believe that anyone who is interested in defense policy is likely to find much in it which is at once novel, provocative, and convincing. In particular, Pape explicates many of the concepts involved in warlike coercion with admirable clarity, formulates hypotheses of considerable power and precision, and then proceeds to test these against historical evidence. In doing so he reinterprets many historical data in ways which I always found informed and stimulating, and usually quite convincing. Indeed, readers whose primary interest is in military history per se, rather than policy, are likely to find the historical analyses well worth the price of the book, I would judge.<br />Fundamentally, the book is a critical examination of the proposition that it is cheaper to coerce opponents in war to concede defeat or some important element of it by indirect means rather than to compel compliance through frank conquest. For most of this century, many political and military leaders have subscribed ardently to strategic bombing as just such an indirect means, and it is the base of experience which this has generated to which Pape turns to test and refine his hypotheses. In so doing, he makes his book also a critique of strategic bombing.<br />Pape acknowledges that the threat of total nuclear devastation of its society can be used to coerce a state whose armies are intact. Short of this, however, he concludes that coercion without conquest is extremely difficult, and that when it works it does so by convincingly depriving the enemy of the military means to resist conquest:<br />&quot;The evidence shows that it is the threat of military failure, which I call denial, and not threats to civilians, which we may call punishment, which provides the critical leverage in conventional coercion. Although nuclear weapons can make punishment the critical factor, in conventional conflicts even highly capable assailants often cannot th! reaten or inflict enough pain to coerce successfully, Conventional munitions have limited destructive power, and the modern nation-state is not a delicate mechanism that can easily be brought to the point of collapse.&quot;<br />Pape considers other coercive strategies as well: &quot;Punishment strategies attempt to raise the costs of continued resistance; risk strategies, to raise the probability of suffering costs; denial strategies, to reduce the probability that resistance will yield benefits,&quot; and, &quot;The use of air power for decapitation--a strategy spawned by precision-guided munitions and used against Iraq--strikes against key leadership and telecommunications facilities.&quot; (He does not address embargo and blockade very directly, although his arguments are certainly relevant to assessing their probable effectiveness as methods of coercion: Pape argues that escalation and decapitation are, along with punishment, relatively ineffective, and would surely assign no higher value to embargo and blockade.)<br />More formally, Pape advances a two-part theory, dealing with the conventional and nuclear cases. (He acknowledges that, &quot;It is possible that modern chemical and biological weapons have, or soon will have, nearly equivalent capability&quot; to nuclear weapons as instruments of punishment, but does not pursue the issue further, perhaps for lack of relevant historical evidence.) With respect to conventional coercion, he introduces what he calls the conventional denial theory:<br />&quot;Conventional success is a function of the interactions among the coursers strategy, the target state's military strategy, and the target state's domestic politics. The denial theory of coercion incorporates six propositions about conventional coercion:<br />&quot;1. Punishment strategies will rarely succeed....<br />&quot;2. Risk strategies will fail....<br />&quot;3. Denial strategies work best....<br />&quot;4. Surrender of homeland territory is especially unlikely....<br />&quot;5. Surrender terms that incorporate heavy ad! ditional punishment will not be accepted....<br />&quot;6. Coercive success almost always takes longer than the logic of either punishment or denial alone would suggest.&quot;<br />On nuclear coercion, Pape concludes:<br />&quot;In contrast to conventional coercion, the accepted wisdom on nuclear coercion is mostly right. It succeeds by manipulating civilian vulnerability, according to four propositions:<br />&quot;1. Nuclear coercion requires superiority....<br />&quot;2. Denial strategies are not useful in nuclear conflicts....<br />&quot;3. Risk strategies can be useful in nuclear disputes....<br />&quot;4. Nuclear punishment should be effective but rare.&quot;<br />Having stated his theses, Pape proceeds to the historical analyses which he adduces in their support. Before doing so, however, he makes some broader arguments, one of which struck me as particularly resonant:<br />&quot;The citizenry of the target state is not likely to turn against its government because of civilian punishment. The supposed causal chain--civilian hardship produces public anger which forms political opposition against the government--does not stand up. One reason it does not is that a key assumption behind this argument--that economic deprivation causes popular unrest--is false. As social scientists have shown, economic deprivation often does produce personal frustration, but collective violence against governments requires populations to doubt the moral worth of the political system as a whole, as opposed to specific policies, leaders, or results. Political alienation is more important than economic deprivation as a cause of revolutions.&quot;<br />I would observe in this connection that it is always difficult to understand the attachment that foreigners feel for their peculiar institutions, so different from those we regard as normal and proper--the more different, the more difficult. Our way of life is of course greatly superior to all others: we all know this in our hearts and cannot understand why those people are not eager to overthrow their syste! m in favor of an imitation of our own. This is a major trap which leaders no less than the man in the street fall into time and again.<br />As stated, Pape's fundamental theses are not restricted as to instruments of coercion, beyond the distinction between conventional and nuclear. Natheless, as his title indicates, his primary focus is on air power--bombing--as a coercive instrument, arguing that, &quot;Of the major components of modern military power--land, sea, and air power--each of which can be used for coercive purposes, air power, particularly strategic bombing, most cogently reveals the relative effectiveness of different coercive strategies.&quot; Thus his historical analyses all center around air campaigns.ender of homeland territory is especially unlikely....<br />&quot;5.
