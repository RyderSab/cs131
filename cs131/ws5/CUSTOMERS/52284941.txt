Reading the book, I recapture the feelings of insight that originally attracted me to psychology. <br />  <br /> The main idea of the book is that many difficult to explain behaviors, such as masochism and suicide, result from a need to escape - and that this need to escape is very specific escape from self-consciousness. Baumeister goes into detail about the various motivations for this need to escape and how they motivate different forms of escape, and also details social trends that have magnified the burden of escape from the self. <br />  <br /> This is in many ways the kind of book I would love to write. Baumeister is able to see the implicitly accepted dogmas and flaws of the culture he lives in, much like a Nietzsche, before they are generally recognized. It's interesting that this work is out of print now - and the idea not generally appreciated by those who could best put it to work. This pattern occurs with many 'heretical' thinkers. And since the works details more the downside of our obsession with self - something we do not recognize as a choice, or something unusual - this might explain the book's status. <br />  <br /> Easily the most interesting social/behavioral science book I have read in a long time - it also opens many new avenues for scholarship to the careful reader. Highly reccomended.	2004-08-01

I am a research psychologist, but I have often doubted at points in my career that science is adequate for the job of understanding humans.  So, I was potentially sympathetic to this book.  <br />That said, however, the tone of the first chapter was so negative, based on unsubstantiated ranting, that I did not find I was interested in continuing on.  The author would make direct causal links from an ephemeral thing such as the notion of reductive science to the suicide rate among farmers.  In the process, assuming I knew anything about the suicide rate of farmers - I have no idea what the pattern looks like, what it coincides with, and he just doesn't tell you.  Shall I just assume that pattern supports his opinion, then?  <br />I realize that I am asking the author to take a scientific approach to his somewhat &quot;anti-science&quot; opinion.  Perhaps I give myself away as &quot;hopeless&quot; to those that support his opinion there.  But the problem is, I wasn't opposed to this opinion - I was receptive to it - but I wanted something solid which I could anchor the negative effects of science on, and an understanding of the proper role, the benefits and place of both science and non-science.  I did not feel it was forthcoming from this author.  The piece I read, I felt, did not help me towards the goal of understanding what science is good for, what its limits are, and what properly belongs beyond those limits.  I think it's an important thing to address, and from the reviews I thought this book would contribute there, but I found it lacking, and a bit off-putting.	2002-09-25

It must be noted that the book requires a fair amount of mathematical background that students coming to choice theory from non-economic backgrounds might not have.  The book may be almost inscrutable if you are not ready to think mathematically about choice an aren't familiar with mathematic-decision speak.  To that reader, I would refer you to a book called &quot;Thinking and Deciding&quot; by Jonathan Baron and/or the Psychology of Judgment and Decision Making by Scott Plous.  For a reader with a psychology background such as myself, those were much gentler introductions, although the material in this book is worth mastering if you want to do serious work in the field of decision making research.	2001-02-28

Although the writing sometimes focused on irrelevant details like the biographies of some of the artists, in general you will learn a lot about music and get a lot of great ideas for new music to go out and search for.  I bought this book as a musician obsessed with finding out the origins of different sounds and hearing all of the true original and passionate music I can.  This book is an essential key in this quest.  I reccomend it to anyone with a screwed up, obsessive mind about music like myself.  I believe I have to know what every original band sounds like so I know exactly when my music is influenced and by whom.  Pretty weird and impossible to know, but it's part of the &quot;anxiety of influence&quot; I suppose.  Actually if you want to read Bloom's book on that topic alongside this book, it might make for an interesting experience.	2001-01-30

The limitations I refer to are as follows: First, I have not read a lot of radiohead interviews or articles as I haven't yet found a music magazine I consistently like (besides CMJ, which rarely includes interviews).  Second, I haven't read any other radiohead biographies.<br />Thus I can't comment on the accuracy of the book.  Also, it might seem strange to you that people would be writing and reading radiohead biographies while they are still either at their peak or climbing towards it.  <br />I also found it strange, but strangley wanted to buy it after reading a litle bit.  The reason I bought it is because I am a musician and I wanted to learn more about how radiohed got from point A to point QDGYX to kid A.  And for that purpose, the book was quite useful and lead me to a lot of interesting new information and ideas.  It won't tell you the precise secrets, but it will give you enough to get you thinking about entirely unrelated creative musical concepts.  It also lets you know anough about their approach to music to get a sense for how this groundbreaking pop came to be.  <br />I give it 4 stars because it's worth buying but is a little odd, and isn't literature.  It's a good read for musicians and ardent fans of the band who don't read idiotic music papers like Rolling Stone.	2000-12-28

Anyone, Christian or not, highly  moral or immoral, may write a book on a question of comparative religion.  I am not aware of a requirement of Christianity for intellectual rigor (although it is a flattering idea for Christian intellectuals!)<br />However, it is true that preaching of Christianity should be reduplicated in one's lifestyle, as Soren Kierkegaard so often pointed out.  However, Kierkegaard also was financially secure.  Kierkegaard recongized this and humbly submitted that he had learned to give some things up (e.g. the love of his life, his dignity) and hoped God would teach him to sacrifice more.  I assume it's only the same with Ravi.  Jesus does in fact call his followers to live in poverty and to be spit upon and not many in fact do this.  However, Ravi puts himself ina very public forum, very boldly, and has certainly been subject to plenty of ridicule and derision for his views, so let it not be said he has made no sacrifices....<br />....I think if you asked him, he would admit that he could improve and that maybe there are more things he could give up.  But it seems to me that he's essentially devoted his entire life to spreading the word he believes in, in a unique way.... <br />Jesus among other Gods is guaranteed to be a thought provoking and interesting book, even if you disagree with it.... Read it, think, decide for yourself.	2000-08-06

Also, many of us want to believe there are some ways to improve education in this country.  I enjoyed this book,  and found it a  stimulating read.  However, there's one major criterion on which I felt  this book failed.  <br />While motivating the need for remedying education,  Schank takes the approach of preaching to the converted.  Either that, or  he acts as a demagogue, I am interpreting it politely.  Basically, he  establishes the need for change in education, by and large, anecdotally,  without reference to relevant evidence, without reporting any research or  non-subjective demonstration of the motivation for his proposed  fix.<br />Also, one must accept the concept that this fix would work on a  large scale on faith.  Who knows?  Maybe exponentially expaning  computer-based learning could improve education in many ways.  Would those  improvements remedy ALL the ills of education he cites?  Maybe... maybe  not.  <br />would there be negative side effects to expanding the role of  computers in instruction?  Schank does not consider these possibilities  thoroughly enough.  In short, a very interesting idea that is presented in  an uncomfortably one-sided fashion.  A reccomended read; but to be read  with critical faculties as well as an open mind.	2000-06-23

Contrary to Anonymous Boston reader's comments, this is not a comic book - although it does have illustrations.  But those illustrations add everything to the  book.  They are Palmer's mode of expressing wit and lightening and  personalizing what is basically a philosophical book.  I understand that  Palmer takes this approach in many of his works; I plan to find more of  them.  I bought other books in the &quot;For Beginners series&quot;  thinking they would all be this good, but Palmer's are the best book of  this sort I have in my collection.        This book helped stimulate me  into an abiding interest in Kierkegaard's thoughts and life.  As I've read  more (of course, SK's writings, Lowrie's biography, and compilations like  the &quot;parables&quot;) I've found myself returning to Palmer over and  over again.  This book gives a compelling rendition of Kierkegaard and  remains one of my favorite introductory philosophy books.   A treasure -  and a travesty that it is out of print.  Publishers!

To help potential readers, I will clarify a little about the book.  In many ways, it is not a book about decision making per se, but  rather ethics and decision making.  As such the title doesn't quite fit:  perhaps it should be called how good people -should- make tough choices.        Given that the emphasis of the book was somewhat different than  expected, Kidder made a decent book out of the general topic of ethics.   Not arcane in any way, chock full of examples and designed to be  user-friendly.

We used a chapter from this book for my graduate Philosophy of mind class.  To be fair, I must note that I was not favorably disposed towards eliminative materialism to begin with (nor any other materialism, really).      My preference aside, though, I found at least this chapter (#2) to be  rife with misunderstandings of other fields like AI and neuroscience.  Even  when you are generous to Churchland's arguments, they often turn out to not  be arguments at all.  Granted, issues like materialism, mentalism, and  dualism are difficult to find solid ground on.  What I object to is that he  portrays as crystal clear arguments which aren't even logical, even if you  grant his premises are true (which they often aren't).  Obviously I can't  give an in-depth criticism here, but I have a short paper on the topic.     Anyways, you may want to find a more complete and more careful text.

Books	2	46	73	N	N	the grand hypothesis that isn't	Persinger gets one extra star for having an interesting research topic.  However, as it is listed below, the book is badly edited.  Furthermore, if you take a close look at the research behind it, you will find the logic is  faulty.<br />Persinger's basic claim is that all religious experience is, is  microseizures in the temporal lobe.  He bases this on some interesting  findings in temporal lobe epileptics, some of whom develop a syndrome,  which sometimes includes enhanced religiosity.  <br />Now I have a familiarity  with that research, but you don't need to have that to see why Persinger's  claim isn't supported.  Suppose you can demonstrate that the epileptic's  religious experiences are induced by seizures and even trace very  specifically how it happens.  Suppose we knew with certainty that even in  normal people, if we stimulate the right areas of brain tissue, it will  produce some sort of religious experience.<br />Does it follow from that  finding, the conclusion that ALL religious experience MUST be based on  siezure-like brain activity?  Not really.  We could talk about causation at  multiple levels, or alternative causes of the same thing.  Psychology is  fond of talking about proxal and distal stimuli... among other things.   Also, Persinger's metaphysics are bad.  Probably no worse than anyone  else's, which is to say, bad.  There's no reason to find a materialist  neuroscience account more compelling than, say, an immaterialist account.   OK, enough ranting.  <br />Before you give me an un-useful rating, do you  really think anyone should pay sixty bucks for a book written by a  half-baked scientist (this work hasn't exactly got him a position at  Harvard, contrary to those who think it's groundbreaking).  If you really  must, take it out of the library and examine the evidence for yourself.   But read critically.  IT's a magnificent sounding argument if you don't  think about it, and accept a lot of anecdotal evidence (he wants to claim  he can talk about what caused the experiences of historical figures, even  though he has only historical anecdote to rely upon, which is not  scientific).	1999-12-04

Furthermore, it is clear that he has a point in mind for the larger  Christian community, and I think it should definitely be read by anyone  falling into this category who's made it this far.<br />However, I also think  this book speaks to people from a secular point of view who are just  interested in how worldview may relate to art.  It's one perspective on  that.  It was easy to read, yet it stimulated much thought (especially part  II).  It is essentially a long essay, or two essays.

Now, reviews like that are really disturbing.  It's obvious this fellow won't even make the effort to examine worldviews different than his own.  That is just as weak as the sort of unthinking Chrsitianity they portray.   Mr. Schaeffer's writings, to the contrary, are generally well thought out,  and give consideration to other viewpoints.  <br />Furthermore, the reader  rated it low based on worldview, which is an awfully bigoted practice that  I am afraid we never will be rid of.  I don't rate books dismally if I  disagree with them - I do so if the arguments are so poorly stated that  they don't even help me think about my own position.  Schaeffer's writings  are always a good thinking machine.  If you aren't a believing [whatever],  it doesn't mean you shouldn't read books about anything different than what  you think. That is the road to parochialism and a transformation from human  to xerox machine for the atheist faith, or the Protestant faith, or  [whatever].  Which is something Mr. Schaeffer, on my reading (especially of  something like &quot;Art and the Bible&quot;), would be quite against.  <br />Schaeffer's writing is lucid and interesting to any sensetive being with  a concern for big issues.  I don't agreee with everything he says, either,  but it was still worth every minute of my time to read.	1999-11-30

Though one review talks about scientific  bias, if you ask Sternberg which epistemology he bases his work on it will  certainly be science.

I use the book for personal reading and to give a sense of history and develppment to other  courses.  His book is especially notable for considering a wide variety of  psychological ideas, and its consideration of the interaction of cultures,  societies, and psychology.  the only reason I give it four stars is because  it's not quite as exciting as a novel and I want to see certain sections  expanded - (eg. the intellectual-cultural roots of founding psychologists  in Germany and Vienna) - but the bibliographies are especially meaty for a  textbook.	1999-07-17
US	52284941	R1CICMCS5RQJ9G	0393311066	193634257	The Courage to Create	Books	4	15	18	N	N	a decent collection	First of all, who the hell writes a book review without ever reading it?   Moving on, I would give limited praise for this book.  In terms of May's other work, it does not  surpass something like &quot;the cry for  myth.&quot; I should like to bring to your attention that the book is a  collection of lectures and vary in their quality when transformed into  essays.  A few are thought provoking and a few are irrelevant and the rest  are in between.  It's worth reading if you enjoy existential psychology and  are curious about creativity.  If you just want to know about existential  psychology, choose a better book.	1999-06-13
US	52284941	R1814S9Q3MW3TK	0521576040	508538468	Handbook of Creativity	Books	5	20	22	N	N	A wide ranging book, great advanced level introduction	Just reading the table of contents of this book will expand the ways you thought creativity could be studied.  This is a cery broad book that gives representation to most of the approaches to studying creativity that have  proven fruitful at all to date.  Includes chapters on case study,  historio-metrical, psychometrical, experimental, and many more research  paradigms in creativity.  Because the book is so wide ranging I'd say it's  best as an intriduction for a college or graduate student interested in  either perhaps entering this field of research, or one who is simply  interested in a highly comprehensive and somewhat technical overview of  inquiry into human creativity.  Since it includes two chapters on the  history of thought on creativity, it is even more comprehensive than one  may expect!	1999-06-13

Some reviewers have said the book is worthwhile for pointing out the gospels are  probably not news reports but have some fictional elements. &quot;Big  deal!&quot;...any observant person can figure this out.    Mailer's  portrayal looks to be as biased as any other biographer has been, except  he's gaudy enough to write it as autobiography.  The Jesus here is a  boring, flat character.  I wanted to discover a compelling leader, I met  someone a good deal less interesting and powerful than some of my friends.   Mailer could have done so much more with this book.  The only redeeming  quality is his portrayal of Satan and some of the other characters who get  less attention in other writings.  Nothing could be worse, or less true,  than a Jesus no one was interested in or concerned about, which was how  reading this book made me feel.	1999-01-06
