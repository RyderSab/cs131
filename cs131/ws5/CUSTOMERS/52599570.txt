The series have so far more than thirty books, with different \\"main characters\\" strings. This first book features the wizard Rincewind as its main character, serving as a kind of host to Twoflower, a rich and somewhat naive tourist in Discworld's main continent.<br /><br />This book is full of Pratchett's acid british humour. The story is fun to read, at an easy pace, as the author describe his incredible settings, a world in the shape of a long-play (rotating in its axe, of course) set on the backs of four elephants that for their turn stand on the shell of a more-than-giant gallactic turtle (the Great A'Tuin) swimming through the void.<br /><br />Rincewind is a complete failure as a magician, yet he hides inside himself a power not even he can understand. Along with Twoflower, they go over many of the amazing places of the Discworld, like the Edge or the upside-down giant moutain (Wyrm) that serves as lair for hundreds of dragons, always facing near-death situations and meeting recurrent characters in the series, like Mort.<br /><br />\\"The color of magic\\" starts slow, but quickly improves and is sure to hook readers that enjoy well-written fantasy books, with the kind of humour that is similar to Pratchett's fellow countrymen Douglas Adams and the Monty Python gang.<br /><br />Grade 8.8/10	2005-10-06

Perez-Reverte's \\"The Club Dumas\\" and Charles Palliser's \\"The quincunx\\" are two similar (and better) books that come instantly to mind. \\"Ex-libris\\" is complicated, full of coming-and-going characters, and its plot is difficult to follow. Yet, it's a good and interesting book.<br /><br />Set in the post-Cromwell restored England (mostly London), we follow the middle-aged Isaac Inchbold, a bookseller hired by a  mysterious old-nobility lady to pursue a missing book from her father's library. Inchbold tells his narrative in first person, wandering through the british landscape, following strange lead after strange lead, meeting unlucky events and harmful people. Parallell to Inchbold's narrative, King delivers another sub-plot, of three people trying to escape recently invaded Prague with a treasure in tow.<br /><br />I didn't like the two narratives going side by side; the reader must pay full attention to the story, otherwise the reading gets very confusing. The \\"escape from Prague\\" subplot is much slower than Inchbold's. Yet, \\"Ex-libris\\" is an interesting book, very well researched and written by Ross King, full of Londonian atmosphere. It's not a light reading, though - not a book to be read while on vacation on a beach, for example.<br /><br />Grade 7.8/10	2005-10-06

His mainstream work, the Alex Cross series, is like that. Patterson writes mostly police fiction - good police fiction at that - and when I found out he had written an historic fiction book, I became immediately interested.<br /><br />But there are some problems with this book. First of all, it seems to be a joint work. Books that are co-written by two authors always feel like some kind of sham - at least to me. Unless both authors are very well known, like Stephen King and Peter Straub, for example. \\"The jester\\" is not the case. Who is Andrew Gross? At a first glance, it seems like Patterson has only \\"lended\\" his name to improve sales. Well, maybe this is not the case, because I was able to identify at least some of Patterson's dry, direct writing style in the text.<br /><br />The biggest problem with \\"The jester\\" is not the plot, which is not original, but simple and appealing - Hugh, a deserter from the Cruzader Army, goes back to his native village to find his wife and newborn son murdered by the merciless landlord, and now Hugh wants revenge. The big problem about this book is that the setting is great, but misused. The characters speak like twenty century people. The story doesn't feel mediaeval. Never. It seems Patterson and Gross - or Gross and Patterson - thought of writing a Middle Ages book using only the background and peopling it with modern characters - and, except from the main character, Hugh, I don't remember the name of any other.<br /><br />That's \\"The jester\\": shallow, fast-paced, unauthentic. Yet, it's good entertainment. Go figure.<br /><br />Grade 6.0/10	2005-09-16

Either you love it or you hate it. It seems that, as people reads further in the series, they become angrier and more impacient at the author, who seems to have stalled the story. I have been warned, and I gave \\"The eye of the world\\" a try. So far, no regrets. Jordan surely knows how to write, how to develop his main characters, and how to give a tense atmosphere to his plot. Rand, Mat, Nynaeve, Egwene, Lan and Moiraine, among others, are great characters, running from evil towards the Eye of the world, where a battle must be fought. The world created by the author looks like Middle Earth, and the plot is surely similar to Lord of the rings, but who cares. As long as the story is compelling, Jordan has my approval to take me back to Frodo-like adventures.<br /><br />I will read the Wheel of time series as long as I find it interesting. This first book is a great work of fantasy, in a world that has many interesting features that can be further developed by the skillful author. No complaints.

It features a resourceful and intelligent professor, a beautiful skilled lady, an unstoppable murderer (with little intelligence) and a fierce boss. It deals with a secret of some kind, and every character is running to disclose the enigma before the other party does.<br /><br />No, it's not \\"The Da Vinci code\\" nor \\"Angels & Demons\\". It's Dan Brown's first book, \\"Digital fortress\\". But if you have noticed any similarities with his previous books, this is no coincidence. Dan Brown has evolved as an author, but in this first book he looks like an amateur. After reading this book, it is possible to see that he has learned to develop his plots further, and his writing skills are surely better, but the premise is always the same.<br /><br />I won't even comment about his research and the editorial work done on \\"Digital fortress\\" - the ENIGMA machine weighed 12 TONS?? I don't know much about cryptography, but in my opinion it is simply impossible that the top code-breaking minds in the country can't see the evident connection between names like Tankado and Ndakota. This is treating the readers like idiots.<br /><br />All in all, \\"Digital fortress\\" is not a good book. Its plot is very weak. Its characters never seem real. The situations are far-fetched. If I were born in Spain, I would be outraged by how the author had treated my country. The good thing about reading Digital fortress\\" is that we can see that Dan Brown has learned how to write since then. \\"Angels & Demons\\" is much better than this one. And \\"The Da Vinci code\\" is in a much higher standard than both previous books. Stick to them instead.<br /><br />Grade 4.0/10	2005-09-08

These blockbusting bestsellers always grab my attention. I like to see for myself what makes people buy them. Sometimes I enjoy them very much - \\"Da Vinci Code\\", the Harry Potter and Dark Tower series, and many more. Sometimes these bestsellers are simply unreadable - I have tried Danielle Steel and Sidney Sheldon, but couldn't finish either. Well, tastes differ in each person.<br /><br />So, I picked up \\"The five people you meet in heaven\\" because it was a very short read, althoguh some of the people I met here on Earth - people that had read this book - told me it was simply wonderful, a blend of Paulo Coelho and Jostein Gaarder. To tell you the truth, Paulo Coelho and Jostein Gaarder are two of the worst authors I've ever come across, but I went on and read Mitch Albom anyway.<br /><br />This book is much better than I expected, but reading it is not the fullfilling, once-in-a-lifetime experience people promised me (of course). Eddie, the main character, is the maintenance chief of a second-rate amusement park. At the beginning of the book, he dies. He goes to heaven. As the title says, he meets five people that were, in different ways, part of his life. Mitch Albom uses these five characters to tell Eddie's life from the beginning, and explain its meaning.<br /><br />Albom's writing is simple and direct, but he doesn't treat his readers like idiots - like Paulo Coelho does. He is not trying to teach you something in a boring way with each sentence - like Jostein Gaarder does. He simply thought of a cute afterlife story, wrote it, and sold millions. Good for him. The story is really cute, but not original. It's never boring, but always plain. And, oh yeah, it is as corny as can be. But, all in all, nice.<br /><br />So, there it is. I have read it. My life has not changed forever. I'm still the same person I used to be. But \\"The five people you meet in heaven\\" is a simple, fast book. Read it. Maybe YOUR life will be changed.<br /><br />Grade 5.8/10r />	2005-08-31

This is an excellent story, which deservedly won many awards and prizes.<br /><br />Jeff Winston, the main character, dies in the very first sentence of the book. He wakes up 25 years earlier, in his old university quarters. In his past life, Jeff was a mediochre radialist, struggling in his marriage, short of money, with his head full of things he had wanted to do but never had the possibility to. Now he finds he has the chance to begin again, almost from the start, and with full knowledge of what's going to happen in the next quart of century. Will he have the guts to achieve what he missed in his past life? Will he make the same mistakes, or will he try to make the future better? And what happens as his death date comes near? Will he have another chance?<br /><br />These are some questions that cross the reader's mind as he or she goes through the book. And there are many more.

Stephen King toyed with almost every horror-story concept in the earlier years of his career. But, wait a minute, where is the werewolf?<br /><br />Here it is, in a short novel divided in 12 chapters, one for each month of the year, one for each full moon as the monster attacks Tarker's Mills over and over again. During this year, during the cycle of the werewolf in this little city, Mr. King will show us how the community deals with a monster in its midst. Who is the monster? How are they going to stop it?<br /><br />Once again, Stephen King creates a tale full of a dark atmosphere, and he excells at it; his characters all have brief appearances, each with its own story, but they are hard to forget after the book is finished. Bernie Wrightson's simple and powerful illustrations add to the feeling of being inside Tarker's Mills as we read the book.<br /><br />\\"Cycle of the werewolf\\" was created as a concept-novella, but stands alone on its own.<br /><br />Grade 8.0/10	2005-08-31

He did it in the excellent \\"Jurassic Park\\" - his best book so far, in my opinion - and in \\"Sphere\\". But now the results are far from what I expected.<br /><br />This time it's nanotechnology instead of DNA manipulation and dinosaurs. There is a close environment, also an island of sorts, an isolated facility in the middle of the Nevada desert. The villains of the story are swarms of nano-entities that were supposedly intended to help during medical procedures; but these swarms, whose behaviour is dictated by a computer code, have evolved and ran away on their own. Nobody knows how they did it and nobody knows what they'll be capable of. A group of scientist and computer wizzards are called to get them back before God only knows what kind of destruction the evil swarms are planning to do.<br /><br />Nanotechnology is fascinating, but Crichton's book is not. Crichton recently seems to be suffering from johngrishamnitis, a disease that attacks the creative part of authors that used be great a little while ago. \\"Prey\\"'s plot is very thin, the characters were all the same to me - divided between the good ones and the bad ones - and all that happens in the book seems to follow a mediochre hollywood script. Sure, there are thrilling parts and chapters in the story, but I knw from experience that Crichton can do way better than this.<br /><br />Anyway, a fast, mildly entertaining read - perfect for a long flight or a lazy day at the beach.<br /><br />Grade 6.0/10	2005-08-25

As far as I know, \\"Thinner\\" is one of the first stories written by this excellent author, brought back to life when he was already famous and wanted to \\"make an experience\\" using a pen-name. The plot itself is interesting. The way the young Mr. King/Bachman wrote the book is not.<br /><br />Billy Halleck is a fat lawyer who ran over an old gipsy lady and unwillingly killed her. Because of that he was cursed by one of the other, older gipsies. The curse was only one word: \\"Thinner\\". As the chapters pass, Billy looses his weighy, his family and seems to be loosing his mind too, while he goes after the gipsy camp in order to have the curse taken back from him.<br /><br />\\"Thinner\\" is not that bad a book when viewed alone. But if you compare it to other Stephen King books - or even Richard Bachman with \\"The long walk\\" and \\"The running man\\" - \\"Thinner\\" is clearly one of his weakest efforts. Apart from Billy, only one character is worth mentioning - the others are all thin ideas of people, even the supposedly bad guy of the story, the old gipsy Taduz.<br /><br />I think this book should be read as a way of knowing how an author can evolve during his career.<br /><br />Grade 4.5/10	2005-08-25

After reading \\"On writing\\", it seems I still haven't read a book about writing. More than a lesson, it feels that Stephen King has invited you to a chat on his favorite armachair over the fireplace, the reader listening to him while taking a glass of wine.<br /><br />The book is divided in three parts. First, a short autobiography of the author; as always, SK wants the reader to feel the atmosphere, this time the atmosphere of his childhood, of his struggling first jobs and family life with wife Tabitha and how he broke through with \\"Carrie\\". Then there is a session of writing tips - more like a \\"DOs and DON'Ts\\" about the craft. In fact, Stephen King tells the reader how HE writes, and you decide if you want to take his advice or not. The last part is more like a personal release by the author, as he tells his constant readers about his near-tragic accident while walking the backroads of Maine.<br /><br />This is a light reading, never too deep, never boring. I think Stephen King's usual readers will enjoy this book more than people that are not acquainted with his work.<br /><br />Grade 8.2/10	2005-08-23

This time there is no unbelievable plot twists, no deus-ex-machinas, no sudden new characters popping out of nowhere.<br /><br />Connelly this time chose a simple plot about the murder of a small-time records tycoon involved woth the Mafia in Las Vegas. What is best about his books is that Bosch's investigations' procedures feel very real. There are loose ends, believable misleading clues, undercover agents, and many more. Connelly has a gift about developing characters that serve for small purposes on his plot, but they seem very real nonetheless, no matter how small they are. And an old character from the past makes a comeback - and this is also good about Bosch's books, they are all part of one universe, and this fictional universe stands on its own.<br /><br />\\"Trunk music\\" is not the best book by Connelly, but it may be the most serious. Along with Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro, Bosch is my present favorite policial character.<br /><br />Grade 8.0/10	2005-08-23

I have known about the plot of this book for a long time, and although I have been fascinated by it and eager to read it, I managed to do it only now. The idea of a giant, rabid St Bernard attacking a woman and a child stuck in a car in during some of the hotter summer days is great. I thought the book would revolve around this basic plotline, and nothing else much. I was wrong.<br /><br />\\"Cujo\\" is a simple-told story, but it has many layers and many subplots involved. Of course, the main part of the book is when Cujo is stalking Donna Trenton and her little child Tad in a broken-down Ford Pinto, while the temperature - well above the hundreds - is slowly depleting their strength. But why is Donna and her son trapped there? Who owns Cujo? How did he get rabid? Did Donna have a husband? Where was he? All these questions are answered in the book, and each one of them presents a very good subplot. Stephen King uses the entire first half of his book just to present his characters, what is happening in their lives and how they interact. Not to mention the setting. Castle Rock is one of the spookiest locations in recent literature - along with another known little town to Constant Readers, Derry, also in Maine. Stephen King takes his time to set the right atmosphere. And he does it very well.<br /><br />Grade 8.8/10	2005-08-17

There's no way to deny that. \\"The summons\\", \\"The brethren\\", \\"The testament\\" and \\"The king of torts\\" are a very pale immitation of what the early Grisham (\\"A time to kill\\", \\"The firm\\", \\"The rainmaker\\") was. Three times he has departed from his legal thrillers with very good results, twice with novellas and once with a full length novel, the excellent \\"A painted house\\".<br /><br />\\"Bleachers\\" is one of those novellas. It has been said that it's a tale of reunion, and that's exactly what it is. Neely Crenshaw was once the quarterback of the Messina Spartan, an almost mythical football highschool team coached by the no less mythical Eddie Rake. Messina lives, eats and breathes football, and now that Eddie Rake is at his deathbed, many of his ex-players have come back to his wake.<br /><br />Through the eyes of Neely Crenshaw, John Grisham tells many tales about the Spartan, about Messina and about some of the characters that made the team great. Eddie Rake was not an easy person, and many of the stories concern his difficult relationship with his players - that loved and hated him with the same intensity.<br /><br />In the end, the reader is rewarded with a good, fast story, although very sad and somewhat non-conclusive. This is not a new story, but it is well told. And we can see that the author still has that good literary vein. Why keep pushing the lawyers' stuff?<br /><br />Grade 7.9/10	2005-08-17

Bosch remains the same - angry, bitter, and with an enormous sense of duty -, yet Connelly, a very skillfull and resourceful author, is able to complement and further develop his main character based on hints he scattered in the previous books.<br /><br />This time Bosch, suspended from his activities, will devote his spare time to investigate a murder that has haunted him for the past thirty years: the murder of his own mother. Connelly is able to weave a plot that began forty years earlier, involving prostitution, politics and struggle for power, and at the same time we, the readers, are able to get to know Bosch a little more: what was his infancy like, and what drives him today.<br /><br />\\"The last coyote\\" is the best book so far in the Harry Bosch series. Connelly has improved - not quite overcome, but surely improved - his \\"final twist\\" problem, giving the story more authenticity, and the plot is surely great.<br /><br />For those who think that \\"detective stories\\" are a lesser kind of literature, I always recommend Michael Connelly and Dennis Lehane. They are great authors, with excellent characters and their books present settings (Los Angeles and Boston, respectivelly) that feel real to the reader.

Philip Pullman's His Dark Materials first book in the trilogy is very intriguing, and further reading of its sequels felt mandatory.<br /><br />\\"The subtle knife\\" is much more complex than the first one. While Lyra Belacqua is still the main character, she has now the company of Will Parry, a fatherless boy running from the police for commiting a murder, and whose mother is a little insane. They travel through worlds, hiding, searching many things, engaging in battles, and receiving help from unusual sources. Will, as a character, is as strong as Lyra, which makes this book very hard to stop reading. The sequence of things happens in a very fast pace. And now Pullman introduces in his plot scientists, metaphysics, and some other things that are difficult to understand at first, but which will lead, in my opinion, to a great ending in \\"The amber spyglass\\".<br /><br />\\"The subtle knife\\" is one of those linking second-parts of trilogies that have become better than the first one, like \\"The empire strikes back\\".<br /><br />Grade 8.8/10	2005-07-07

After the promising beginning with \\"The black echo\\" and  the confusing but still revealing \\"The black ice\\", Harry Bosch is back in his finest story so far. This time, Connelly has created a great plot, involving a serial killer from the past that seems to have, somehow, been brought to life again, and a civil action against Bosch, lead by a relentless female lawyer.<br /><br />Connelly seems to have an endless imagination to create new characters, and to further develop his usual ones. And he also seems to connect all his stories, not only the ones about Bosch, but also his \\"standalone\\" novels, featuring, for example, Jack McEvoy or Terry McCaleb.<br /><br />Bosch is my present favorite policial character, along with Lehane's Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro. He's different, complex and Connelly always comes up with something new to add to his personality. This time the author blends policial procedures and investigation with courtroom drama, and the results are very good.<br /><br />As a last comment, Connelly's endings were his weakest point (based on the 4 books I'd read by this author), but this time he seems to have delivered something more consistent. \\"The concrete blonde\\" is, by a little margin, better than \\"The black echo\\" and this makes it the best of the three first books in this series.<br /><br />Grade 8.9/10	2005-07-07

From then on, the Beaudelaire orphans will have to deal with deadly snakes, murder, inventions, books, sharp teeth and car wrecks.<br /><br />Lemony Snicket / Daniel Handler continues the Beaudelaire saga from where he left us at the end of the first book. The style remains the same, the narrator making conversation to the readers, teaching them new words and expressions. This book is a little darker than the first one, and the three main characters do what they usually do. In fact, as far as I have noticed, the books in the ASOUE series are more like the many chapters in one larger book. We can't expect (I think) dramatic changes in the pace or the style of the narrative, but to read them and to find out about Count Olaf's next scheme will and whar will become of the three orphans is always fun.<br /><br />Grade 8.7/10	2005-06-30

While \\"To say nothing of the dog\\" is almost like a comedy, set in the Vitorian Era in England, \\"Doomsday book\\" is a much more somber and serious tale, set in Medieval Oxford.<br /><br />Both books are set in the near future and deal with time-traveling, and both share some of their characters, such as Mr. Dunworthy, the scholar responsible for Balliol's Time Net, in Oxford. This time he was overruled by a Mr. Gilchrist (the equivalent of Lady Scrhapnell in the other book) who has sent Kivrin, a Medieval specialist, to the 14th century. However, everything that can possibly go wrong happens after young Kivrin is sent to the past. In the 21st century, a misterious virus starts a new pandemic, and the time-specialists team gets crippled real fast. On the other hand Kivrin, in the past, struggles against a world that is different from everyhting she had studied about it; besides, she is very sick herself, and, after some days in the past, she seems to notice that maybe she was sent to the wrong year.<br /><br />Willis has created a very interesting set of rules to time-traveling. These rules create the plot around which the story evolves. And what a great story it is. In the beginning, the chapters are very confused, as are the characters and the situations they live. As the book goes on, however, Willis skillfully writes a very dark story of loss, sickness and superation. Some of the characters are unforgettable, like the industrious Kivrin, the saintly Father Roche, the dedicated Mr. Dunworthy and the apocalyptic Colin. The final chapter is apotheotic.<br /><br />No wonder \\"Doomsday book\\" won both the Nebula AND the Hugo. It's one of the greatest books of the genre that I've read.<br /><br />Grade 9.0/10re that I've read. <br /> <br />Grade 9.0/10 <br />	2005-06-24

They always make me go back to when every story was different, every thing was new, and I wanted to be like all those heroic characters that peopled those wonderful tales. Lemony Snicket's \\"Series of unfortunate events\\" was released as an instant classic, and I always wanted to find out why. Now, after reading the first book in the series, I know.<br /><br />First of all, there are no impossible feats attributed to the three young Beaudelaire orphans, Violet, Klaus and baby Sunny. They are as common and down-to-earth as I was when I was their age. There are also no magic tricks, no nice fairies and no advanced technology to help them in their unfortunate lives after their parents die in a fire that consumed their mansion. Not that tales with magic, fairies, goblins and ultra-modern stuff aren't great - we have Harry Potter and Artemis Fowl, just to name the most known examples, and they are also great - but this time the author chose to show to his young readers that even the most simple characters can have great adventures.<br /><br />Written in a simple but eloquent manner - where the narrator talks directly to you, like a teacher -, with a sarcastic and a little dark vein, \\"A bad beginning\\" shows the radical change in the lives of the Beaudelaire orphans as they have to live with the despicable Count Olaf, a man whose sole interest is to grab the orphans' fortune, and will conceive the most mirabolant plans to achieve his objective.<br /><br />The story is very simple, and the book is very short, but I think that as an introduction to a series of more than ten books, it is perfect. Perfect to grab the interest of its readers - not only the young ones, but also the older ones (myself included) -, perfect to make every reader wonder if there will not be really a single happy ending to the Beaudelaires.<br /><br />I'm hooked, and I expect the series will get better with each new story.<br /><br />Grade 8.6/10	2005-06-24

Professor Stewart's only book in science-fiction quickly turned into a milestone concerning apocalyptic themes. William Brinkley's \\"The last ship\\", Pat Frank's \\"Alas, Babylon\\", Nevil Shute's \\"On the beach\\" and Stephen King's \\"The stand\\" all come to mind as having similar ideas, although each of the five books mentioned have their own characteristics and deal with the subject of \\"end of human civilization\\" in unique ways.<br /><br />\\"Earth abides\\" is more like a one-man chronicle. Isherwood Williams, a reclusive geology student, finds himself a survivor of an unnamed \\"Great Disaster\\" that has wiped out 99% of humankind. During the course of the book, Stewart tells the reader how Ish, as he calls his main character, learned to live again, without all the comforts of civilization, forming a new family, than a new community. Ish thinks of himself as \\"the last american\\", and Stewart explains very well why that is so.<br /><br />Although not overtly a \\"dark\\" science-fiction story - like \\"On the beach\\", for example -, \\"Earth abides\\" has a subtle way of making the reader very uneasy and impotent as he turns the pages. This book was written almost sixty years ago, but has a very modern feeling about it - not scientifically, of course, but if we think about how Man deal with his peers and with nature, Stewart's book will ring some known bells.<br /><br />Grade 8.7/10	2005-06-23

Harry Bosch is still the same, lonely, bitter, determined and not giving a damn about what his superiors think. The plot of the book, however, is not as strong as in \\"The black echo\\". Connelly continues to develop his main character, and that's good, because Bosch can be read like a real person, full of flaws and weaknesses, but also with an incredible sense of duty.<br /><br />This time, the apparent suicide of a fellow policeman triggers an investigation that leads to a powerful new drug, secrets from the past, and an investigation that will take Bosch to the mexican border, amid sterile insects and bullfights. Yes, it seems strange, but the book is solid... until a certain point. Similar to what happened in \\"The poet\\", the final \\"explanation\\" of the whole case is not very believable, and depends on too many assumptions to work. Anyway, I see \\"The black ice\\" as a good oportunity to know how Bosch live and work a little further.<br /><br />I begun reading \\"The concrete blonde\\" as soon as I finished \\"The black ice\\" and, already halfway thorugh it, I can see it's more interesting then the second one. Like other reviewers stated, \\"The black ice\\" may be seen as a bridge between the first and the third book in the series.<br /><br />Grade 7.2/10	2005-06-15

However, in the last few years, although he has not abandoned Sharpe, Cornwell began to gather attention because of his books dealing with historic fiction set in the Medieval Era. First there was the highly-acclaimed \\"Warlord Chronicles\\", a modern and accurately historic vision of the Arthurian legend. Now, \\"The archer's tale\\" or \\"Harlequin\\" - the book's british name - is the first one in the \\"Search for the Grail\\" series.<br /><br />Set at the start of the Hundred Years War, \\"The archer's tale\\" concerns Thomas of Hookton and his desire for revenge against the french, who have destroyed his village on the shores of the English Channel, killed his father, rapted his girl and took back to France his family's most revered object: the lance of St. George. In french territory, Thomas will have to learn how to be the best archer in His Majesty King Edward's army, defeat fortified cities, protect a beautiful widow and, most of all, find the infamous Harlequin - the man who stole the relic - and avenge his family's name.<br /><br />Cornwell's knowledge of the period, battles, characters, costumes and habits seems enormous. Although character development clearly is not his bist feature - leading to some obvious scenes of good characters against bad ones - Cornwell's excellent descriptions of the battles (especially the Battle of Crecy, the apotheosis of the book) and the non-stop focus on Thomas of Hookton, a very sympathetic character, creates the necessary atmosphere for an above-average mediaeval historic fiction.<br /><br />This book is part of a series, so although the book ends after the Battle of Crecy, the quest for the Grail goes on with \\"Vagabond\\" and \\"Heretic\\", two books I'll surely buy.<br /><br />Grade 8.0/10	2005-06-09

Just when I thought my faith in John Grisham's literary skills were reaching the bottom - after total flops like \\"The summons\\", \\"The testament\\" and \\"The brethren\\" (his last books I haven't even bothered to buy) - I came across \\"A painted house\\" in an used-books store. I had heard rumors that this book didn't feature  \\"a single lawyer, dead or alive\\", so I bought it. Glad I did.<br /><br />A painted house is a sort of fictional auto-biography - if such a thing exists. The main character is seven-year-old Luke Chandler, the small boy of a cotton-farming family in rural Arkansas, 1952. Although only a child, Luke's life will be full of adventures and new things happening this summer, as he picks the little white vegetable balls along with his grandparents (the grumpy yet responsible Pappy and the angelical yet tough Gran), his parents and a bunch of \\"hill people\\" and mexicans.<br /><br />This mixture of different cultures  - and all the struggles and situations that come with it - is what makes \\"A painted house\\" great, more so because it's viewed by the eyes of a child discovering that life is not that innocent at all.<br /><br />If law-thrillers have become a burden in Grisham's career, I think he has the potential to write other stuff. As far as I can see, he should be doing that.<br /><br />Grade 8.8/10	2005-05-24

His main character, though, is a common man, just released from prison after his wife suddenly died in a car accident. On his way to her wake, he finds the mysterious Mr. Wednsday, who offers Shadow a job as a handyman. Mr. Wednsday is not who we think he is, but neither is Shadow, and, in fact, neither is any character in this book.<br /><br />As Shadow makes his errands through the backroads of America, he begins to see there's a storm coming, and a war within this storm. A war between gods, the ancient ones and the modern ones. Shadow, a man with no identity, with no beliefs, is caught in the middle of the approaching storm. As Gaiman describes Shadow's life after his release from prison, he introduces a grand variety of unusual characters - gods, jinns, daemons, fairies, computer and technological entities, creating a tale very different from everything I had read until now. Interestingly, it's not the gods' stories that make \\"American gods\\" a great book, but Shadow's tale, his detached amazement, his coin tricks and his seemingly lack of illusion about life. Nevertheless, Shadow will be drawn to what is happening around him, and he will play an important part in the battle.<br /><br />\\"American gods\\" is an unusual book. It's very difficult to understand it at first, but once the reader grasps what Gaiman is trying to tell, the reading becomes very pleasant.<br /><br />Grade 8.9/10	2005-05-03

I think \\"Aztec\\" is his masterpiece, but \\"The journeyer\\" and \\"Raptor\\" are not that far behind.<br /><br />While reading \\"Aztec\\", I was totally transported to the \\"one world\\", back in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries of the christian era. Mixtli was a great character. His life was a great life. Jennings's readers were so appaled by his tale that they were left wanting more. Almost two decades later, their wish was granted. Of course, to be better than \\"Aztec\\" was a nearly impossible task, and not even Jennings was able to do it.<br /><br />In \\"Aztec autumn\\", a sequel of sorts, Mixtli briefly appears, but the main character this time is Tenamaxtli, one of Aztl&aacute;n heirs, who have to cope with his land being invaded and ruled by the spaniards. Tenamaxtli has revenge boiling in his heart, and he will conceive many plans to make the white smelly devils go back to where they came from.<br /><br />The book starts well enough, and for a time I thought \\"Aztec autumn\\" would be as great as \\"Aztec\\". But this book lacks the presence of many of the great secondary characters that peopled its predecessor. Tenamaxtli is interesting enough, but he's surrounded by cardboard characters. Many of them appear only briefly. The subplots are also not very great. Many reviewers complain that some of those subplots are sorry excuses for overrated sexual experiences; I don't entirely agree with them, because I understand that sexual scenes were a very strong part of Jennings' writing style, but this time those scenes were not as greatly written as the ones existent in his three masterpieces. Also, the ending in \\"Aztec autumn\\" seems very rushed, as if the author himself got tired of his book and just wanted it to be over.<br /><br />But when we're dealing with historical fiction, there are not many authors that can deliver a fantastic book like Jennings does - Noah Gordon and Ken Follett come immediately to mind. To go back to the One World / New Spain in the 1600s one more time was worth the reading. That's why this book deserves a 4-star rating.<br /><br />Grade 7.2/10to be over.  <br /> <br />But when we're dealing with historical fiction, there are not many authors that can deliver a fantastic book like Jennings does - Noah Gordon and Ken Follett come immediately to mind.

Paul Wilson when I came across \\"The keep\\" on the pages of Amazon.com. The plotline surely got me interested. Nazis, a castle, romanian folklore and a monster lusting for blood. Besides, I had never read a true horror book, and reviewers stated that \\"The keep\\" surely was one of them.<br /><br />While Wilson knows how to create a tense and dark atmosphere for his story, helped by the chosen close environment of the mentioned keep atop the romanian alps, the characters' development lack conviction. The first half of the book is surely good, full of complex misteries, such as the cross-like indeture that covers all the keep's walls, and the shadow of a hung man in a painting. As we read futher through the plot, though, the book changes focus. New characters are introduced - including the all-time-hate-favorite-Nazi-SS-lust-for-killing-Colonel - and the atmosphere of the tale is lost. There is a romantic interest - unnecessary in my opinion - and at this time the change of pace is bad to the story. Only in the final chapters Wilson is able to get back to his initial development, once again keeping the reader's attention.<br /><br />When I finished the book, I thought \\"This is a very strange story\\", but after a while I began to see that \\"The keep\\" surely is a very fine book, though not what I was expecting. I read it with the wrong state of mind. People say this is a \\"true horror story\\". It's not. It has some horror elements, sure. But, all in all, \\"The keep\\" is the beginning of a series of thriller books with a dark atmosphere and has, as main motive, the ancient battle of good against evil.<br /><br />Anyway, Wilson's style and competent writing kept me interested in buying \\"The tomb\\", the second book in the \\"Adversary Cycle\\".<br /><br />Grade 8.1/10	2005-04-18

Born on the very beginning of the twentieth century, he was able to participate in the Republic of Ireland's struggle for liberty from the United Kingdom. Born in the utterly poor side of Dublin, he was drawn to live with and fight side by side with important characters in Irish history, like De Valera, Michael Collins and James Connolly, among others.<br /><br />Henry is the narrator of the book. We see everything from his point of view. And he is surely not a history teacher. While the descriptions of his infancy and teenager years in the streets of Dublin are very vivid, the pivotal moments in Irish history are given to the reader as if he (the reader) already knows the historical background. I certainly didn't. After a research done via the internet, things started to become clearer.<br /><br />Doyle writes in gunfight style. Many things happen to his main characters, one on top of the other. The important thing is, Doyle was able to put me right in the middle of a war-ridden Dublin in the early 1900s, and he left me wanting to know more about Henry Smart, as the book ends when he is only twenty (but during the book he refers to things that happened to him after the period portrayed in this story).<br /><br />\\"A star called Henry\\" was my first book by Doyle.

In \\"The Hotel New Hampshire\\" there are no powerful single characters like TS Garp or Homer Wells; the powerful character, in this case, is the Berry family.<br /><br />Will Berry, his wife and five kids are the owners of a building that used to house a school for girls; they transformed it into a hotel, the first Hotel New Hampshire. In a small town, business is not that great, things are a little slow. So, the story concentrates on its characters, and the relationships between them. Will and his wife are a nice couple, struggling to raise their children in the best way possible. Will's father is the high school football coach. He is a strong man, a weight lifter and a health enthusiast. There are five sons. Frank, the oldest, a homosexual and an intelectual, stiff, reserved and strange. Franny, the beautiful, bold, foul-mouthed, sexually problematic daughter. John, the narrator, shy, strong, with a little problem: he is in love with his sister Franny. Lilly, the diminutive future writer, trying to grow up. And Egg, the youngest, is deaf. Around them there are always a bunch of secondary characters, each one of them very well developed by Irving; whenever they appear, they give support to that part of the plot. The story shifts to Vienna and then back to the United States, always with a new Hotel New Hampshire, where the Berry family tries to rebuild its life once again.<br /><br />\\"The Hotel New Hampshire\\" is not as good as \\"The world according to Garp\\" or \\"The cider house rules\\", but is a very strong book nonetheless. Sexual questions are always present in the plot, the incestual desire between brother and sister the chief among them. Irving does not treat these kind of relationships in a raw way, but always with lots of good humor and skilled writing. The characters are great, the usual Irving, strange, complex and different. Once again, the author uses elements of fantastic reality to write his book. Irving's reality is not like the same one we are all used too. I mean, a child named \\"Egg\\" is just the tip of the iceberg. Someone that goes around disguised as a wild bear is another example of what Irving can throw in in his story. The reader must get used to it; it is not a question of finding it believable or not, it's a question of accepting it as another kind of literary device. If you don't accept it, you will hardly like Irving's books.<br /><br />As I've already said, \\"The Hotel New Hampshire\\" may not be the best book by John Irving, but those who liked \\"Garp\\" and \\"Cider house\\" won't be disappointed. I'd recommend reading one or both of those books before reading this one.<br /><br />Grade 8.8/10characters are great, the usual Irving, strange, complex and different.

From the beginning I liked Kenzie, Gennaro and the way they relate to each other. But, compared to \\"Darkness, take my hand\\", the first book in the series looks like a mere introduction.<br /><br />\\"Darkness, take my hand\\" is dark, complex and violent. Extremely violent. But Lehane makes it seem also very real, because he writes about Boston and its suburbs with a passion that only a caring native of the city could feel. This time is not a war between gangs. This time Kenzie and Gennaro are hired to investigate, follow and protect the son of a friend. During the case, they find that the truth is much more complex than they can possibly imagine, involving their family past and the ones they presently love.<br /><br />Lehane is very graphic in his descriptions, and that is saying much. He is not afraid to dare. There are many scenes in this book that are not that believable, but they are so strong and powerful that the effect is great. The characters continue to be developed. Lehane did not give everything away in the first book. In \\"Darkness, take my hand\\" he reveals further information about not only Kenzie and Angie, but also about his recurrent secondary characters, like Bubba and Boston PD detectives Oscar Lee and Devlin Amronklin, among others.<br /><br />The Kenzie / Gennaro's two books I've read in the series are really great. Lehane's stories unravel the worst about human nature. They are as explicit as can be, and that makes them real, whether we like ir or not.<br /><br />Grade 9.2/10	2005-03-28

It may seem strange at first sight, but awarded author Connie Willis, weaves all these non-related subjects into one fine story, with plenty of intrigue, mistery and an incisive and somewhat dark humor.<br /><br />The main character is Ned Henry. From the first chapter, we know that he is a time-traveller, trying to locate the bishop's bird stump for Lady Schrapnell in the Coventry Cathedral shortly after the Nazis' air bombing of that town. This last sentence doesn't make much sense, huh? Well, that's how the reader feels about the plot. Ned Henry doesn't give away much of anything at first, because he is almost as lost as we readers are. As the story unfolds, we learn, along with Ned, not only his job as a time-traveler in the Victorian Era, but the impediments inherent to little-spaced jump between times and the way time-travel works. To say nothing of the dog, the cat, the loony professor, the romantic lover, the butler, the beautiful neiad and the fake medium, all part of this great, at-first-sight strange but very enjoyable book.<br /><br />\\"To say nothing of the dog\\" won the Hugo Award in 1999.

So did I. But forget the movie. The book has little resemblance to what you've seen on screen. A few characters, and the settings. That's about it. \\"Enemy at the gates\\" is pure Holywood. \\"War of the rats\\" is much more close to reality.<br /><br />David Robbins did a reaching research before he worte this book. That shows in the story. Stalingrad - or what was left of Stalingrad during the war - is very well depicted: the icy Volga, the destroyed buildings, the german attack, and the russian resistence. Staligrad is as much a character in \\"War of the rats\\" as is Zaitsev, the siberian supersniper. Robbins writes about the two sides of the story, the russians and the germans. The russians have stablished a sniper school, lead by Zaitsev and his troup of sharpshooters, as a way of mining the will of the Wermacht. The germans, trapped in a frozen urban landscape, try to reach the Volga and the unnocupied and resourceful lands beneath it. The russians use a tactic of guerrilla warfare, where Stalingrad is a no-man's-land of sorts, and the germans bring in Heinz Thorvald, the ultra-confident german sniper. In the desolate city, these two masters of precision will fight each other to death, without even seeing their faces at close.<br /><br />Robbins' style is dry, objective, almost as journalistic as his character Danilov, the propaganda reporter. There are no hollywoodian showdown, no impossible or heroic feats of war. In fact, the war is shown as it really should be: ugly, bloody, a complete waste of human and material resources. That's the main thing about \\"War of the rats\\". I think there are many ficitional aspects in the book, but I also think it is very close to reality, in the sense of human relationships during a terrible conflict, not in technical aspects. Zaitsev is no hero. Thorvald is not a manic monster. They were two people fighting in opposite sides in a war. And Robbins portrays that fight very well.<br /><br />Grade 8.2/10s not a manic monster.

Lehane is bold without being pedantic, and modern without being overstyled.<br /><br />\\"A drink before the war\\" is the first in the Patrick Kenzie / Angela Gennaro series. The two bostonians share an office in the tower of a church, where they sit to look through the window and work the cases they get as respected private detectives. In this book, the job is fairly simple, at a first glance. Two senators and a congressman ask Kenzie and Gennaro to find Jenna Angeline, a janitor in the Senate House. She appearently abandoned her job, taking with her a stack of photographies. The representatives are, of course, more concerned about the photographies than with the woman. Patrick and Angela take the case, and soon see themselves in the middle of a gang war, fighting powerful people and being attacked by different sides.<br /><br />Lehane's book is one of those that will keep the reader reading without rest. Lots of action sequences (some of them a little bit overplayed, but this is fiction, and it fits the story), never boring, never slowing the pace down. But what I liked the most was the characters. Kenzie has a terrible past relation with his father, the heroic fireman. He is corageous, shy,  honest, bold and stupid. He could be many people I know. Angela is also a great character, but I think her stunning beauty makes her a little less believable than Kenzie. Anyway, Lehane is an intelligent author, and gives clues to his characters personalities in the middle of his story, and the reader always has something new to disclose about them. Right now I'm reading \\"Darkness, take my hand\\" and I can see that Kenzie's and Gennaro's backgrounds will be constantly developed in further books. Other constant characters in the series are also interesting, like the two Boston PD detectives, Oscar and Devin and the teddy bear psychotic arms dealer Bubba.<br /><br />The city of Boston itself is a character (and a powerful one) in Lehane's book. He is able to describe the different parts and aspects of life in Boston, and make the reader understand that the city is a very important part of his plot. Lehane is one of my favorite detective/thriller authors, along with Michael Connelly and Greg Iles.<br /><br />Grade 8.9/10ton PD detectives, Oscar and Devin and the teddy bear psychotic arms dealer Bubba.  <br /> <br />The city of Boston itself is a character (and a powerful one) in Lehane's book.

Not in the same sense of James Michener or Ken Follett, for example, authors whose books are about closer, more \\"at-hand\\" themes. Renault's main work concerns the ancient Greece, the Greece of myths, legends and Olympic gods.<br /><br />\\"The king must die\\" is a book about Theseus, that little guy we learn about when we are kids, the guy that entered the Cretan Labyrinth with a ball of thread given to him by his lover Ariadne, daughter of King Minos, with the intention of killing the monster Minotaur. The legend is beautiful, but Renault's book is even better than that, in the sense that the settings seem real, the characters seem real, and the story still have the aura of a legend, but complemented with elemets that make it seem more fact than fiction.<br /><br />Even if it was written almost half a century ago, the author's style remains modern - this book doesn't feel like a burden to read, which sometimes happens when dealing with older books. The story is not fast-paced, but it is not slow either. Renault has her own rhythm, describing Theseus' life from when he was five or six years old, his relationship with the gods (especially Poseidon), his love for horses and wars, the discovery of his real ancestry, and, finally, his life as a man among the bull-dancers in Crete.<br /><br />Renault writes about a time that is surrounded by mist. Not many records remain from that era, and she had to blend her factual research with her imagination, to create a tale that could be historically possible about a subject that is impressed in our minds as legend. She did a great job.<br /><br />The sequel to \\"The king must die\\" is \\"The bull from the sea\\", about Theseus' later life.<br /><br />Grade 8.7/10	2005-03-17

He knows how to weave a competent plot, with interesting and close-to-reality characters, full of flaws and earthly ambitions. He may be best known by his Harry Bosch series, but his standalone books are also considered very good.<br /><br />\\"The poet\\" is one (or was one, until recently) of the standalone books. His main character, Jack McEvoy is a reporter in Denver. His twin brother, Sean, was a cop. He commited suicide, appearently because of an unsolved case he couldn't stop thinking of. But Jack doesn't want to believe his brother killed himself. With pacience and help from the FBI - to which he turned to when he started disclosing some interesting clues about his brother's death - Jack will try to hunt a serial killer they call \\"The poet\\" because of the suicide notes found on the crime scenes of his victims.<br /><br />The plot is very good. I consider Connelly one of the top writers when the issue is police procedures. \\"The poet\\" is not a thriller, but more like a \\"whodunnit\\", with Jack and the FBI - especially beautiful agent Rachel Walling, with whom Jack starts a not-too-beliavable relationship, but this is fiction, right? - following the Poet's murders around the country.<br /><br />The problem with this book is the final pages. After what seems to be the climax, comes another twist - and that's where Connelly looses his ground. This final twist can be seen a mile away, and it's so unreal that it almost ruins the entire book. Many other reviewers have complained about the ending, and I think they're right. I understand it was made to be a cliffhanger to a possible (and now published) future novel, but that is not reason enough.<br /><br />Anyway, I liked \\"The poet\\". It has Connelly's style, only with a bad ending.<br /><br />Grade 8.0/10	2005-03-11

What is fiction, what is real? It's hard to say. If you want a dry account on the historical figures, try Suetonius; if you would like the romantic, poetic and theatrical version, try Shakespeare's dramatic masterpieces (\\"Julius Caesar\\" and \\"Antony and Cleopatra\\" are his best, in my opinion); if you want to see these four people as the most beautiful of their time according to standards of our time, watch Liz Taylor's and Rex Harrison's \\"Cleopatra\\". If you want to get close to them as they might have really been, as real and alive people, try Margaret George's \\"Memoirs of Cleopatra\\".<br /><br />This is not an easy book to read. It is quite long, and there are many secondary characters who don't stay in the story for too long, making them all somewhat hard to track. Nevertheless, it is a very good and well-researched book. Not only Cleopatra, the narrator, but also Julius Caesar, Augustus and, most of all Antony appear as real people, with ambitions and flaws, like everybody else. It only happened that they struggled to control most of the known world at their time, and that makes their story interesting.<br /><br />Margaret George has had an interest in Cleopatra since she was a child. In her own words, this is her masterpiece and has taken almost forty years to be written. It is a very good work and I would recommend it to everybody who's interested about the last days of the Roman republic and mythical Egypt.<br /><br />Grade 8.2/10	2005-03-09

His books are very different one from another. He changes subjects, pace, types of characters. He's able to write a legal thriller with the same easiness he writes a very fast kidnapping story. With \\"Dead sleep\\", Iles continues to prove - at least to me - that he's one of the most talented thriller authors of the last ten years, along with Michael Connelly.<br /><br />In \\"Dead sleep\\", the main character this time is a woman. I think most male writers have this dream of writing at least a book where the main character is a woman, but few dare to try, because creating a decent character of the opposite sex is not an easy task. I think Iles did a good job with Jordan Glass, the award-winning war-zone photographer in \\"Dead sleep\\". He did a good job, not a great one, but that's good enough. Jordan came up a little too similar to a man, but even so she has interesting feminine features, and she's believable for most of the novel. Her background life is very interesting. She's a strong character, living - and doing well - in a male environment.<br /><br />While visiting Hong Kong, Jordan faces a series of paintings portraying sleeping women, but one of those women has her very face - or the face of her twin sister, who's been missing (kidnapped) for the past year and half. Jordan teams up with agent John Kaiser and his FBI squad, in the search of eleven kidnapped women and the madman - or madwoman - that's killing to create his artistic masterpieces.<br /><br />As usual, Iles throws a lots of balls in the air, and during the entire novel he keeps them off the ground. I didn't like the ending, though. It is not much believable, and a little too convenient. But it didn't spoil the fun of reading this great thriller. The series of interviews with the suspects has great dialogues, and a very good character development - the level of which is hard to come across these days.<br /><br />Grade 8.8/10ade 8.8/10 <br />	2005-03-01

I've never heard of Nicholas Guild before, but this didn't prevent me from giving this book a try. Sometimes that happens: we don't expect much from a book or a movie, but when we read it or watch it we get enchanted by the author's style, by the characters and by the vivid descriptions of times distant in the past.<br /><br />\\"The assyrian\\" is more than a good surprise, it's one of the finest  historic-fiction books I've ever come across. Its main character, Tiglath Assur, son of Sennacherib, King of Kings, faces danger from the beginning of his life, and we follow his plights for the next twenty-five years. Nicholas Guild is clearly a gifted writer, and manages well to use the crude times of the ancient era he is portraying to create an unforgettable story of war, greed and lust.<br /><br />Both the story and the author style are very similar to two books I really like: Mika Waltari's \\"The egyptian\\" and Wilbur Smith's \\"River god\\". If you already know those books and/or authors, and you're afraid of reading \\"The assyrian\\" because it is less known, stop worrying. This book is as good as Waltari's and Smith's. And it's great to know that \\"The assyrian\\" has a sequel, so we will be able to know Tiglath Assur's adventures a little further.<br /><br />Grade 9.1/10	2005-02-21

A blend of modern noir - written in the dry style of William Hjoltsberg's \\"Falling angel\\", for example - and political intrigue, this not-so-long book proved a fast and gripping read, with rapid-fire dialogue, lots of action sequences, and isights on the modern japanese culture and its relations with the present world.<br /><br />John Rain, the main character, now living in Japan, is not entirely american, and not completely japanese. He has done a tour in Vietnam, where he learned how to kill and where he learned how to trust nobody and live with losses. Today he is a middle-aged contract killer, whose foremost especiallity is \\"death that looks like natural causes\\". Throw in political intrigue, corruption, modern technology and a beautiful pianist player and it's not hard to see that Eisler has the right elements to create a good thriller. And a good thriller it is.<br /><br />Eisler seems to have spent some time in Japan, so his descriptions of the places Rain goes and the people he meets seem very accurate; japanese present culture - the mix of the ancient stuff, like martial arts, and the modern western invasion, corruption and capitalism, for example - are also well portrayed, and that gives credit to the story.<br /><br />The good part is that there are at least two more John Rain books: \\"Hard rain\\" and \\"Rain storm\\", so the readers won't miss him in the near future.<br /><br />Grade 8.2/10	2005-02-16

If you read it, you'll be rewarded at the end with one of the most fantastic tales ever told. This is the life of Myiamoto Musashi, one Japan's of the greatest samurai, and his lifelong quest for expertise, love and a rightful way of life.<br /><br />Yoshikawa vividly portraits one of the most disturbed periods in Japan's history, beginning the story after the famous battle of Sekigahara (this battle is also portrayed in the final moments of another masterpiece, James Clavell's \\"Shogun\\"), when Japan started to give up on its feudal government system. Musashi is a young man -at the time not even known as Musashi - and after the battle he decides he will be one of the greatest swordmen in his country. But that is not an easy task. Along the way - and along more than 1800 pages, at least in the brazilian version - he will have to defeat scores of enemies, find and loose love, friends, and he will have to learn to live the way fitting to a legend.<br /><br />Yoshikawa's style in not epic, even if his book is. The story unfolds in an utterly simple narrative, almost naive. Characters come and go, filling the pages with their own stories, not only Musashi's. In fact, at times Musashi is not the focal point of the story, disappearing for some chapters, while the narrative concentrates on what is going on with other characters around him. This diversity is what makes \\"Musashi\\" great. This is not a sword-battles book, but a big picture of the end of an era of one of the most fantastic cultures in the world.<br /><br />Grade 9.2/10	2005-02-11

The bad ones are more interesting, they have power, they have money, and the good ones, though poor, are always correct and faithful to their traditional beliefs. Between \\"The pillars of Earth\\" and \\"Night over water\\" this formula suited Follett's plots very well, and he gathererd many constant readers around the world. \\"A dangerous fortune\\" is one formulaic book, though it doesn't mean it is bad. On the contrary, it's the usual Follett, thrilling, well written and full of good moments. But it's far from the author's best.<br /><br />The center of the story is the Pillaster family, traditional bankers - but not yet noble - of the London society at the second half of the nineteenth century. Hugh is the talented young Pillaster, but he's sort of a black sheep of the family. Edward and his mother Augusta, the book's arch-villain, spend the whole book trying to get control of the family bank, while Edward's friend Micky Miranda, a south-american from a ficticious country very similar to Colombia is always trying to make Edward lend him the bank's money in order to achieve a coup d'etat at home. And Hugh must prevent all of that from happening, of course. Throw in lots of love interests, four or five murders, a couple of sex-scenes - also usual in Follett's books - and you begin to get an initial idea of what this book is about.<br /><br />As I've already said, \\"A dangerous fortune\\" is not a bad book, far from that. If you are kew to Follett's work, don't be afraid to try this one: it's not a flopper like \\"The third twin\\" or \\"Hammer of Edden\\". But for Follett's long-time readers this one will bring nothing new. It seems like a compilation of what the author had already put in his previous books. Even so, it's an above-average thriller.<br /><br />Grade 8.2/10	2005-02-10

Set back in early 1982, this book is an attempt by the author to make ammends to his readers. Nobody wants to know about endless reunions in the Oval Office, or Jack complaining all the time about a job he didn't even want in the first place, or how he has to trust his secretary to smoke covertly. No, now Jack is back in his thirties, a promising analyst for CIA involved in a russian plot to murder the Pope, and the defection of a KGB agent.<br /><br />The premise of the book is good. Although we know what happens to the Pope in the end, Clancy usually knows how to describe intrigue, and this time the political part plays an important role in the story. The problem is, \\"Red rabbit\\" is 300 pages too long. The good political plot and the defection part should be really interesting, but the endless dialogue, the repeated and sometimes amusingly idiotic opinions of the characters (stereothypes, most of them, like the \\"bloody\\" thing with the british), and the fact that NOTHING happens during most of the chapters made this book become a tiresome reading. It just dragged on. Take, for example, Forsyth's \\"The day of the Jackal\\". We also know what will happen at the end of the book, but Forsyth took the time to develop a great plot and two unforgettable characters, and constructed his excellent book around them. \\"Red rabbit\\" is nothing of the sort, although it has its moments (few of them). I only imagine what this book could have been if handed to a  writer more concerned about his readers than about sales.<br /><br />But, looking back, \\"Red rabbit\\" is not as disastrous as people say. It is certainly better than \\"The bear and the dragon\\" - and this is not praise, just a fact. This book should have deserved a 3-star rating, but there's one thing that bothered me during the reading, and left me scratching my head in amazement: at the beginning of one chapter, one of the characters is in Budapest, Hungary, and wakes up at dawn, thinking that in Moscow, his native city, he would still be asleep, because due to time-zone differences it would still be dark at the russian capital. I read the paragraph at least a dozen times, trying to see if I had understood it right. Something clearly was amiss. I looked in the maps, just to be sure, just to see if I was not crazy, and there it was: Moscow is WAY east of Budapest; the sun in fact rises first in Moscow than in the hungarian capital. I mean, if a mistake like that can pass edition, what further wrong information is given in the story? I know this is a work of fiction, but this kind of basic errors are simply unforgivable.

The story is simple, but compelling. The characters are great, and the setting and environment is dellicious.<br /><br />Don Jaime Astarloa is an aging fencing master, living in the second half of the nineteenth century, during a time of political difficulties in Spain. Don Jaime's life is pretty empty. He has no relatives, no wife, and a few friends that get together in a coffee shop, to discuss mainly the argument \\"Republic vs. Monarchy\\". Don Jaime doesn't talk that much. His life is his fencing, and the few students that he teaches among doubts caused by the increasing easiness in buying and using firearms. But suddenly his life changes. A beautiful and misterious lady appears out of the blue, and asks Don Jaime to polish her already high fencing skills. Murder, mistery and political intrigue follow.<br /><br />This time, it is not the thrilling part that make the story good, as usually happens with Reverte's books. This time it's the sad description of a decadent life that finds a new spark and a new reason to go on. Obviously, the young woman, Adelia de Otero is also the reason for Astarloa's problems.<br /><br />As I've already said, the story is simple, and not even original. But the fencing duels, the decrepit but sympathetic beliefs of Astarloa and - as always - the misterious beautiful woman make this little book a very good reading.<br /><br />Grade 8.2/10	2005-01-26

The children's story is over, as well as most of the amazement the readers felt due to the novelty of Hogwarts, a witches' world, enchanted bathrooms, and killer trees. Now the Harry Potter saga is mostly about the eternal fight between good and evil. Fortunately, as it happens in most of those unforgettable good vs. evil stories - \\"Star Wars\\", \\"The lord of the rings\\", and even \\"Schindler's list\\", why not? -  the main characters are the central pillar of this fantastic saga.<br /><br />Once again, Harry Potter and his usual best friends - Hermione and Ron Weasley - are back in Hogwarts to course their fifth year, and to finally enter the wizards' proper world, as at the end of their term they have to pass the Ordinary Magic Level tests. It would be a hard year nonetheless, but there's something that will certainly make it harder for them. A certain Lord Voldemort, Harry's nemesis, is coming back, and he gets stronger every minute. Even with the help of the Order of Phoenix, a misterious group of \\"good wizards\\", Harry's struggle will be extremely hard.<br /><br />\\"The goblet of fire\\" may be  the best book in the series, because of many memorable moments, and the first face-to-face encounter between Harry and Voldemort in his new/old form. \\"The order of Phoenix\\" is interesting in another way. The book focuses mostly on Harry, a discredited boy, whom everybody thinks is crazy and delusional about a powerful black wizard coming back to life. Now Harry is fifteen, a full teenager. J. K. Rowling was able to tell in the pages of her book how difficult this period of life is to everyone. Insecure, alone, bad-tempered, this is a new, but very realistic Harry Potter, a person in the transition from childhood to adult life. There's even a love scene in this book! - and all the complications love interests generate from a first kiss.<br /><br />The good thing about the Harry Potter series is that Rowling knows how to tell her story.

All its prisoners are flyers - americans, british, canadians -, somehow shot down during the second World War. Some of them have been there for just a few days, some of them for almost two years. The german guards are harsh, but not too much, and the prisoners learn to live as best as they can in the enclosed environment - playing cards, baseball, trading stuff.<br /><br />Then, one day, a new man comes to the camp - but he's not like the other prisoners, or so they think so: he's a black flyer, named Lincoln Scott. Soon, racial manifestations start to occur. And when the camp's \\"trader\\" - a man like Red from \\"Shawshank redemption\\" - is murdered, all eyes and fingers turn to accuse Scott. Tommy Hart, the main character of the book, is designated to defend Scott, and together they will disclose truths that were hidden well beneath the camp's earthy surface.<br /><br />I had previously read another Katzenbach novel - \\"Just cause\\", a great thriller. \\"Hart's war\\" is a different book. Hart is claustrophobic, and Katzenbach, setting his novel in the confined space between the camp's fences and walls, makes the reader feel a little claustrophobic too. There's no way to escape - the camp has never lost one prisoner. Hart, Scott and their british and canadian friends have to find what really happened in order to save Scott from the death squad.<br /><br />This blend of legal thriller, historic fiction, action sequences and conspiracy theory makes \\"Hart's war\\" really great.

It is a detective story in all senses: murders with only a few scattered clues, car pursuits, explosions, cigarrete butts lying on the floor...<br /><br />But it's more than that. Kurt Wallander is a very interesting character, complex and well developed by Mankell. His wife left him. He haven't seen his daughter in quite a while. His father is on the verge of senility. He's overweight. He has almost no clues to the murders he has to investigate. And yet, he tries real hard to live a better life and do his work. Wallander lies among the men in the limit between being heros or anti-heros. But we, readers, can't help but cheer for this seemingly slow and a little obtuse guy. And we know in the end he will be fine. Or will he?<br /><br />As to the \\"detective\\" part of the story, Mankell is a different thriller writer. There are no clues thrown in by the killers all over the crime scenes, no vengeful evildoers with maniacal plots. Wallander has to work with his intuition as much as with his luck during all the book. But that's close to what real life is, isn't it? Detective work is a slow job, and Mankell has catured it very well; but his book is not slow. On the contrary, it is a fast and intriguing read. And we even get to know a little about Sweden, a country unknown to most of us.<br /><br />I recommend the \\"Kurt Wallander\\" series to all those who like a good and realistic detective thrillers.<br /><br />Grade 8.8/10	2004-12-07

It was \\"The tesseract\\". A story divided into three segments, seemingly unrelated, but that are obviously sewn together in the end.<br /><br />The first part is about Sean, a seaman involved with Don Pepe, the mafia boss controling naval traffic through the ports of Manilla. Sean is lying in bed in a deserted, decaying hotel, sweating as he waits for Don Pepe to show up and maybe kill him. This part is very graphic and violent. The second part - the best one in my opinion- is about Rose, a young woman that left her poor village in the Phillipines to become a successful doctor in Manilla. Rose remembers how she found her first love with Lito, a crippled and humble fisherman. The third part, back in Manilla, has Vincente and Totoy, two street kids, as main characters. This part is somewhat boring, slow, and almost ruins the entire book. If the first part has an interesting setting and plot, and the second part has great characters, the third part has nothing much interesting.<br /><br />But what is the tesseract? The tesseract is a hypercube, something that we cannot see because it's in forth dimension. We can only see an aproximate form, like a 3-d cruciform. That's an analogy to the three stories in the book. We know they relate to each other, they come one on topof the other, we just can't see how. The problem is, when Garland tells us, it is not satisfactory. The final moments of the book could have been more developed.<br /><br />All in all, \\"The tesseract\\" is not in the same league as \\"The beach\\". But it is two-thirds of a good reading.<br /><br />Grade 7.2/10	2004-11-22

I've read three of his books, and all of them are different one from another. In \\"The quiet game\\" you have a legal thriller similar to John Grisham - when Grisham was good. \\"24 hours\\" is a very fast-paced kidnapping thriller, better than James Patterson's Alex Cross series' best moments. \\"Spandau phoenix\\" is totally different, a blend of World War II intrigue with a Clancy-esque plot of world-wide struggle for power.<br /><br />The book starts simply enough, moments after Spandau prison, in Berlin, is demolished. Hans Apfel, a low-profile policeman, finds, during his nightly rounds through the rubble, a stack of papers signed by Spandau's most famous prisoner, Rudolph Hess. The papers contain information that could, through a series of seemingly unrelated events, get the world into a nuclear war.<br /><br />Rudolph Hess' story and all the misteries involving his secret mission to England are still largely unaccounted for - at least to the general public, even after sixty years. Based on these premisses, Iles provides his readers with a plot that goes from the still divided Germany of 1987 to South Africa, Lybia and Israel. Iles throws lots of balls in the air, the characters start to appear before the reader's eyes, only to be slain a few pages later, or to disappear for long times; subplots follow subplots - there's even a subplot that is set during the War, featuring Hitler and Heydrich. However, Iles never drops the balls, or the pace of his narrative. The final moments of the story are incredibly fast-paced, when most of the characters and the plots are sewn together; pursuits, narrow escapes, dazzling machine guns; Greg Iles writes about all this with an easiness compared to Tom Clancy's early Ryan novels.<br /><br />\\"Spandau phoenix\\" is a very nice thriller-slash-historic fiction by one of my favorite new authors - along with Michael Connely.<br /><br />Grade 9.0/10	2004-11-16

This is a good decision, because Novinha's sons, presented to the readers in the previous book, are now grown up, which leaves room for more character development and further interactions between them. If the pequeninos are not as present in \\"Xenocide\\" as they were in \\"Speaker...\\", they still are part of the most important happenings in the book. The Hive Queen and the buggers are also an important part of the plot.<br /><br />\\"Xenocide\\", as a book - plot, characters, writing style, pace - is very similar to \\"Speaker for the dead\\". Many previous reviewers complained about the \\"philosophycal\\" parts of the book - especially when the setting is the world of Path - a planet colonized by the Chinese, where the society is split between servants and the \\"godspoken\\", enlighted people that display abnormal behaviour in order to purify themselves. I, on the other hand, think that Card's concepts portrayed in the book are very cool. Genetic manipulation, a sentient virus, interaction between three very different species, faster-than-light-travel based on Plato's teachings, all these strange ideas interact during the course of the book, and I can't help but think Card is a very talented concept sci-fi author, and he's not afraid to display his very different thoughts in his books. To me, \\"Xenocide\\" was never a boring read, on the contrary, I was always eager to see what the author was going to propose next.<br /><br />This book is clearly not a standalone. In fact, it has no ending. I recommend reading \\"Xenocide\\" with \\"Children of the mind\\" close at hand; even if it may be the weakest book in the series, this fourth installment contains the final moments of Ender Wiggin's saga.<br /><br />Grade 8.3/10br />This book is clearly not a standalone.

There are always many characters, the ranks are confusing, the description of the battles must be very accurate otherwise the reader will be lost. If it's fiction, the author must be very careful not to, unwillingly, transform his book in a re-telling of other, more commonly known battle events. James Webb managed to write a very good book about soldiers at war, \\"Fields of fire\\". Cornelius Ryan wrote a series of excellent non-fiction books about the second World War in its European Theatre.<br /><br />\\"The thin red line\\" is about the battle of Guadalcanal, an island of the Solomons chain and an important base in the south Pacific Ocean, between the american and the japanese troops.<br /><br />\\"The thin red line\\", by author and ex-combatent James Jones, was brought under the spotlights once again more recently after cult director Terrence Mallik transposed it to the big screen, for the second time, in 1998 (the first time was in 1964). The movie is visually beautiful, long, and insightful, with extraordinary development of its main characters. The book does not have visual resources, but Jones' fast prose, moving from character to character, from battle scenes to the long nights spent in the open, all this makes the reader \\"watch\\" what is happening with his or her mind, just like it was a movie.<br /><br />Jones knows what he is writing about. He was there, he did that. And he is intelligent. War battles are not much different, one from another (except if you are actually there, of course). So, Jones technic is to write unusually long chapters, to make the reader feel involved with the environment, with the people of C-for-Charlie Company. All the characters, with no exception, have, contrary to the chapters, unusually short names - four or five letters at most. Witt, Fife, Bell, Dale, Stein, Tall, Bosch, Bead, Gaff, just one syllabe, they are easy to remember and their sonority makes the reader instantly recognize the person associated to the name. Also, the brevity of the names reminds us of the brevity of the lives of his characters, fighting unexpected death at every moment.<br /><br />\\"The thin red line\\" is fiction, but barely. The last sentence of the book gives Jones away. It's fiction in the sense of characters ann their development, and building atmosphere. It is very good fiction, really a masterpiece. And it's a true account on the horrors of war. Fiction and truth, ballanced. Enjoy both parts.<br /><br />Grade 9.0/10recognize the person associated to the name.

It received many awards, the most prestigious of them the coveted Booker Prize, the highest literary award in the United Kingdom. In my opinion, deservedly so. Anyone can see  that \\"Possession\\" is a great novel, different, a blend of many literary styles and tendencies. What many people won't understand is the density and depth of such a work.<br /><br />The story behind possession is a sort of \\"tresure hunting\\", but this time the treasure is literary. In the novel, Roland Mitchell and Maud Bailey are two scholars, obsessed by their subjects of study, respectively the 19th century poets Randolph Henry Ash and Christabel LaMotte. Roland is a low-profile, slow guy that suddenly and unwittingly discovers some ancient papers that hint a possible connection between Ash, the highly steemed poet and model-husband of the victorian-era and the lesser known poet LaMotte, a veiled lesbian, now a role-model and idol of the feminists. Together, Roland and Maud, with the help of the old letters, retrace what can possibly be a love story that may rock the foundations of their literary world.<br /><br />\\"Possession\\" is divided in two settings: one tells the story of the search by Roland and Maud. This part is intriguing, as it can be described as a thriller about literature, something I only have read in Arturo Perez-Reverte's work \\"The club Dumas\\". But Reverte has a more thrilling aspect, while Byatt gives her readers a smooth ride through her \\"detectives\\" finding. The second part of \\"Possession\\" is given through the writings of Ash and LaMotte, and this part is impressive. Byatt created a large amount of victorian letters and poems as if both their fictional poets have written them. It's a dense, slow reading, and I can only blame myself for not fully understanding and appreciating it.<br /><br />\\"Possession\\" is a remarkable work, but it's so complex that only the most experienced readers will completely enjoy it.<br /><br />Grade 8.2/10joy it.   <br /> <br />Grade 8.2/10 <br />	2004-10-19

It is the story of Lyra Belacqua, a boyish twelve-year-old girl living in a parallel universe that looks a lot like our own, but has some fundamental differences.<br /><br />Pulmann's story has some intriguing, different concepts, the most noticeable being the presence of the daemons, talking animals that are inseparable from their individual human beings. The daemons are a reflex of their \\"owners\\", and the reader can learn much about a character by paying attention to his or her daemon. There are more interesting ideas in the book, like the armored bears and the fact that it is set in a time-frame that resembles the turn of the twentieth century. The book is fast-paced, and an easy read. Lyra is a good main character, the reader can't help but caring for her during her adventures in the northernmost part of her parallel Earth.<br /><br />But I think that \\"His dark materials\\" trilogy should not be split in three books; it should be published in only one volume. \\"The golden compass\\", as a book, is incomplete. The reader must have all three books at hand to fully enjoy Pulmann's tale; otherwise, reading with long intervals between the three books, the story will loose its spell.<br /><br />Grade 8.0/10	2004-10-14

Stone is a very competent author, and takes time to do his researches, so the information you'll find in his books can be trusted to be true - he also provides a bibliography about his \\"subject\\" at the end of the story.<br /><br />\\"The origin\\" is about Charles Darwin, the man who came up with the theory of the evolution of the species by natural selection. In fact, Darwin, living in a static, very religious society, was one of the first scientists to dissociate science from religion, even if at the time it was not his intention, and had many problems because of his theories. Darwin's life was very interesting, from his humble beginning as an observer aboard HMS Beagle to his late and prolific years, when he wrote about varied subjects, becoming one of the first \\"scientific bestsellers\\" in the world.<br /><br />Darwin's life is very well depicted in \\"The origin\\", and the reading is not a hard one, even if it's kind of slow. But Stone only presents facts, and makes little effort to present his thoughts about the subject. This is not an insightful kind of biography, more like Darwin's diary written in a more pleasant way. Nevertheless, an excellent book, that provides very useful information about one of the greatest men of all times.<br /><br />Grade 8.6/10	2004-10-05
US	52599570	R25P315H9YTGSE	0345441036	237509158	Black House	Books	4	0	0	N	N	A good book, mostly if you're a "constant reader"	\\"Black house\\" is a sort of a sequel to \\"The talisman\\", the previous joint venture by Stephen King and Peter Straub. I say \\"sort of\\" because there are only a few elements that tie the two books together. One of them is the main character, Jack Sawyer, now a thirty-year old retired cop from LA, living in a small town in the Midwest. The Territories are also featured, linking this book to the Dark Tower universe (much more than \\"The talisman\\" did).<br /><br />\\"Black house\\" has its high and low points. The high points are some of the characters - the blind Henry Leyden, for example. Most of them (the central ones, at least) are sympathetic, but some of them, like Speedy Parker from \\"The talisman\\" are just thrown in in the middle of the story with little concern for further development; the plot is good, but, once again, like in \\"Low men in yellow coats\\" - one of King's best novellas - it gets better if you're acquainted with King's Magna Opus, the Dark Tower series. Otherwise, the book may seem like a common (and evenpointless) fantasy story. The main reason I enjoyed the book was because it gives a deeper insight about Roland of Gilead' quest. Other than that, I wouldn't rate it 4 stars.<br /><br />The lowest point of the book is the ending. Rushed, badly planned, lacks editorial work. I didn't like the narrative style either. It seemed a little silly.<br /><br />\\"Black house\\" is recommended for those who are fans of the \\"Dark tower\\". It is a book that stands on its own, but barely. \\"The talisman\\" was a better book in many aspects, and it was a success. \\"Black house\\" focuses more on Stephen King's stories, and this lack of team work may be responsible for the mixed reviews the book got since its release.<br /><br />Grade 7.5/10	2004-09-27

But a work of fiction nonetheless.<br /><br />\\"Angels & demons\\" follows, roughly, the same path. Dan Brown has created a formula that has been proven a very successfull one. Robert Langdon is the protagonist. He is a quiet, intelligent, well-regarded symbologist. The reader is not entirely drawn to Mr. Langdon as a character, but is somewhat sympathetic to him (and that's enough for a protagonist in this kind of work). Then there's the religious mistery. This time it's not the Holy Grail, but the ancient cult of the Illuminati, a pagan, anti-catholic society that in the past counted names like Galileo and Bernini among its ranks. The new Illuminati were able to steal from CERN (a scientifical research facility in Switzerland) secrets of the new anti-matter technology, and threaten to simply pulverize Vatican City during its most important moment: the election of a new Pope. To prevent this, Langdon has to solve enigmas, find the Illuminati's hidden lair, always helped by beautiful Vittoria Vetra, a scientist from CERN.<br /><br />So, there it is: fast-paced pursuits, murder, ancient misteries and secrets, leaps of faith, a beautiful woman and Robert Langdon. It's very similar to \\"The Da Vinci code\\", but not as good. Brown's achievement concerning these two books is that he has bettered his writing style and has improved his research in the latter one. The central themes of the two books are basically the same, but the important thing to remember is that they are works of FICTION. Are they believable? I don't know and I don't care. All I know is that I had a great time reading \\"Angels & demons\\", as I had before reading \\"The Da Vinci code\\".<br /><br />Parenthesis: (I know it's fiction, but that scene in the helicopter was just too unbelievable and I was amazed it passed through edition unscathed.

Some of them are good, some of them are bad, some are not even stories at all. I have stated in my review of \\"Everything's eventual\\", another Stephen King collection of short stories, that his novels and lengthier works are much better than his shorter ones, and \\"Skeleton crew\\" seems to confirm this theory.<br /><br />Mr. King has a tremendous gift: he has a huge imagination capacity; his plots are usually awesome, and many of his characters are unforgettable (the kids from \\"It\\", for example). But he has to have time (pages, actually) to develop both his plots and his characters. In short stories, that is more difficult, and the final results usually are not as good as his full-lenght novels.<br /><br />Not that \\"Skeleton crew\\" is not a good book. There are some real good stories. The longer ones, mostly. \\"The mist\\", which can be considered the \\"presentation story\\" of the book, is a terrifying sort of \\"camp tale\\", scary, dark, but the ending is not good. Among the better stories are: \\"The monkey\\" (classic King tale of death based on an innocent-looking object), \\"The jaunt\\" (a sci-fi attempt that worked well), \\"The raft\\" (another King horror classic), and \\"Word processor of the gods\\" (the usual what-if, in this case, what if what I typed in the computer became true in real life?). On the other hand, some of the stories are completely forgettable, like the two attempt of poems (if they can be called that) \\"Paranoid\\" and \\"For Owen\\", and the pointless \\"Cain rose up\\" (something like Richard Bachman's \\"Rage\\", but not that well developed) and \\"Beachworld\\" (another sci-fi, but this one didn't work).<br /><br />In my opinion, the two best stories are \\"Survivor type\\" and \\"The reach\\". \\"Survivor type\\" is something like the diary of a man stranded in a tiny island after the ship he was in sunk. The reader watches the protagonist go insane as he has no choice but to eat what, literally, is at hand. And \\"The reach\\" is a very touching tale of old age, life and, ulitmately, death.<br /><br />I guess short stories appeal to each reader in a different way. You have to read the whole book and decide which ones are good and which ones are not.<br /><br />Grade 7.5/10.

That's why her books are so popular and so highly regarded.<br /><br />The story begins in the 20th century, \\"where\\" Claire Randall has lived for the past 20 years, along with her daughter Brianna and her first husband, Frank Randall. But this is just the introduction to the book. In fact, \\"Dragonfly...\\" is Claire's reminescences about how she and Jamie (back in the 18th century) had to spend some time in Paris and among the exiled Scottish nobility in order to prevent the Battle of Culloden, that would become a huge massacre among Scotland's rebellious army's ranks.<br /><br />If you compare \\"Outlander\\" with \\"Dragonfly in amber\\", you'll observe many similarities, but also many differences. Sex scenes are still present in a large number; also present are: complex politics, plot twists and the great \\"stage presence\\" of Claire and Jamie together. But I have to say that I enjoyed reading \\"Outlander\\" better, because of the novelty of the theme and the plot, introduction to many great characters and the fast-paced adventures and intrigues. \\"Dragonfly...\\" is quieter, focused more in political developments; its characters are not as unforgettable as the characters in \\"Outlander\\" were. Some of the chapters were really slow and on the verge of being boring, something I wouldn't expect from Diana Gabaldon, based on the experiences I had with the first book. But \\"Dragonfly...\\", all in all, is a very good book, and  a necessary reading in order to fully understand the whole series.<br /><br />Intelligently, Gabaldon wrote the final chapters as a great cliffhanger to the next \\"Outlander\\" book, \\"Voyager\\".

He deservedly won the Nobel Prize a few years ago, the first portuguese-language writer to achieve such honor. Saramago has a unique style of writing, with very long sentences, fast dialogues inserted in the middle of the phrases, little punctuation and a fluid narrative. And yet, it's not difficult to read Saramago, at least not in his original language.<br /><br />After reading \\"Baltazar and Blimunda\\" (\\"O memorial do convento\\", original title), I went after everything fictional Saramago has written. In my opinion, his imagination, his talent to write prose and his skills at telling a story leave the reader no option but to be completely absorbed by the letters, the words, the paragraphs and the pages. \\"The gospel according to Jesus Christ\\" (\\"O evengelho segundo Jesus Cristo\\", original title) is another example of how good and original Saramago can be.<br /><br />Saramago, a declared atheist, provides us, mere mortals, with a different view of Jesus' life. For example, Mel Gibson's movie \\"The passion of the Christ\\", chose to portrait Jesus' death, with graphic violence, torturing scenes, and many tears - and that's the usual nowadays association; people relate to violence, to dualism and manicheism. \\"The gospel according to Jesus Christ\\", instead, is Saramago's story of what Jesus' life could have been. The book portraits Jesus as a very common human being, literally burdened by a covenant with God. Philosophical and theological discussions are present in every page, not in a mechanical, boring way, but always with witty, inteligent remarks by the author. The dualism is still present, but it leaves room to discussion.<br /><br />\\"The gospel according to Jesus Christ\\" is a polemic, different work, but a mandatory reading nonetheless.<br /><br />Grade 9.4/10	2004-08-17

After reading the reviews at Amazon.com, I got a little disappointed, but gave it a try anway. The book is better than I expected.<br /><br />There's little man know about the construction of Stonehenge, and what was its purpose. Cornwell, veteran of middle-age fiction, constructs a nice, if somewhat simple story about life in Britain 25 centuries before Christ. Saban, Camaban and Lengar, three brothers, descendants of the chief of one of the most powerful settlements in the british island, struggle for power, each seeking it in its own way: Lengar wants to be a mercyless chieftain, Saban wants to be recognized as a great warrior, and Camaban, the twisted, abandoned child, wants to be the greatest sorcerer on Earth.<br /><br />Cornwell tells the story of these three main characters; around them, the author provides the reader with battling cities, vengeful gods and the construction of a stone temple that could change the face of the planet. The story in itself is interesting, but what I found best about \\"Stonehenge\\" is the good exercise in imagination done by Cornwell, thinking about what was life like in the dawn of history, and, furthermore, what may be the purpose behind the construction of Stonehenge.<br /><br />\\"Stonehenge\\" won't linger in the readers' minds after it's finished, but it certainly will be fun during reading.<br /><br />Grade 7.8/10	2004-08-12

I bought it because the synopsis seemed interesting, and because the cover had a great rendering of Hitler's face. Given these circumstances,  I wasn't expecting much, but once I noticed the praise in the reviews at Amazon.com and I started reading it, I was instantly captivated.<br /><br />Heywood goes from the premise that we don't really know what happened to Hitler and his body once he noticed his war was over. The author tells the story of a back-up plan made up by Hitler and his trusted SS major, G&uuml;nther Brumm, where they deceive everybody, escaping Soviet-occupied Berlin and running through the Austrian Alps. But Vasily Petrov, the Berkut, confident of Joseph Stalin and head of a Special Operations group, knows something is not right. \\"The Berkut\\" is the fast-paced, interesting and thrilling narrative of this pursuit, that lasted exactly one year.<br /><br />Heywood was in no hurry writing his masterpiece. He details everything, from Hitler's cover-up death to intimate portraits of his characters. The sequence of events is logical, with no unbelievable plot twists, nor deus-ex-machina thrown in in the middle of the story. The epilogue is one of the most gruesome, horrible, yet plausible book-endings I've come across in my life.<br /><br />\\"The Berkut\\" is a great story, unfortunately almost forgotten by the editing companies and general public.<br /><br />Grade 9.1/10	2004-08-04

From D-Day + 1, through the hedgerow fighting in northern France, the battle of the Ardennes, the terrible winter in 1944/45, and finally the ocupation of part of Germany, Ambrose tells us how the Allied Army marched through lack of food, blankets and sometimes even good advising to defeat their enemy.<br /><br />With a blend of investigative journalism, memories, and war chronicles, Ambrose once again created a simple but informative and, most of all, human account of the battle for Europe in the second World War. No wonder Ambrose's books are so popular. He doesn't want to teach, but to share experiences.<br /><br />I liked best the chapters about the different \\"professionals\\" of war: the medics, nurses, prisoners of war, etc. They are a very good portrait of living in society during difficult times.<br /><br />\\"Citizen soldiers\\" is part of one of the great trilogies about WWII - together with \\"D-day\\" and \\"Band of brothers\\". This trilogy shouldn't be missed by someone who wants to deeply understand what happened to some of the men that fought the war.<br /><br />Grade 8.0/10	2004-08-03

Among SK's greatest characters we will notice many children. In \\"It\\", \\"The eyes of the dragon\\", \\"The talisman\\", \\"The shinning\\", the most interesting character are always children or young people. \\"Insomnia\\" is completely different in this aspect.<br />The main character in \\"Insomnia\\" is Ralph Roberts, a man pushing seventy, and not in a very good health. After the death of his wife, he starts having sleeping problems, and, stragest thing of all, his perception rises to fantastic level: he starts to see colored auras around people, little bald doctors with scissors and scalpels, and other unbelievable manifestations. Soon Ralph finds that all this has a specific purpose, and the fate of many worlds may lie in his old hands.<br />The beginning of the book is a little slow, very strange, but when the pace increases, it's hard to put it down. I don't think \\"Insomnia\\" has any political conotation whatsoever, even with the abortion issue. Serious as the matter surely is, I think it's there only to provide a thrilling background to the story.<br />I don't consider \\"Insomnia\\" my favorite Stephen King book, but nevertheless I was never bored while reading it. I think it's very good, but a little confusing at some parts. The confusion and the sense of pointlessness will be greater if the reader is not acquainted with the Dark Tower series. For that, \\"Insomnia\\" can be considered a standalone, but more like a complement to the Dark Tower books.<br />I would not recommend reading \\"Insomnia\\" without reading the Dark Tower first.<br />Grade 8.2/10	2004-07-19

Those who have read \\"Lord Valentine's castle\\" can't help but become amazed by Majipoor's imense size, its huge cities with billions of people of many alien races, and, most of all, the enigmatic and divided system of planetary administration, where dreams and the subconscient play a great part.<br />Silverberg knows that, with Majipoor, he has a science-fiction mine gold in his hands. \\"Majipoor chronicles\\" is the second book in the Majipoor series, but can be read before \\"Lord Valentine's castle\\". Through eleven stories, some short, some a little longer, Silverberg explores many aspects of Majipoor: the relationship between the humans and the alien races, the huge geography of the planet, the influence of the King of Dreams, and other sociological elements. Sex, power, greed, nature, everything plays a part in Silverberg's simple but compelling tales, and in the end the reader is rewarded with a collection of fable-like stories concerning Silverberg's greatest creation.<br />I think the Majipoor series is one of the greatest in this genre of literature, and certainly one of my favorites. Silverberg has created a world with the right amount of science and fantasy blended together, and that's not an easy task.<br />Grade 9.0/10	2004-07-15

It's almost impossible to go through its 1200 paperback pages without a notebook specifically set aside by the reader to write down scattered information, genealogies, twists, new characters and locations, and I would advise future readers to do just that.<br />The main plot (the book has dozens of inter-related plots) is about John Mellamphy,  a young boy living with his mother and a couple of nurses and maids in the early 19th century in rural England. Young Master John doesn't know it yet , but his family's past history is extremely strange and complicated. When the past begins to catch up with John and his unfortunate mother, they will experience extreme poverty, desillusion, weakness. In the Victorian London, gray, crowded, violent (masterfully described by Palliser) they will descend to the lower conditions a human life can possibly bear, dragging with them many other characters as they appear in the story, and not all of them will be able to reach the surface again.<br />Many aspects of the book are really interesting. For example, unusual names like Phumphred, Mallyphant and Steplight help to create the necessary grimy atmosphere adequate to a victorian novel. And what is best, Palliser treats his reader in an intelligent way: he chekced and re-cheked his plots, found inconsistencies, corrected them. Palliser doesn't reveal everything in his lines. Many things he's left the reader to discover for himself, and some other things have no solution.<br />Is \\"The Quincunx\\" an easy read? Far from that. But those who will be able to reach its ending will be rewarded with an unforgettable story.<br />Grade 9.3/10	2004-07-05

This time, Cross and his team have to face two simultaneous enemies: the first, a pair of loose-cannon killers, acting in the high-society and political circles in Washington, D.C.; the other, an insane killer murdering innocent children.<br />\\"Jack and Jill\\" is not as good as the previous two books in the Cross series; although Alex Cross is less superhero-like and more humnan in this third installment, the two parallel stories are confusing, and Patterson was not able to create villains and minor characters as well developed as the ones he created in \\"Along came a spider\\" and \\"Kiss the girls\\".<br />I understand that \\"Jack and Jill\\" is somewhat a milestone in the Alex Cross series.

Bur while \\"Different seasons\\" can be considered a \\"lighter\\" book by Stephen King standards, \\"Four past midnight\\" is a comeback to King's earlier darker, fantastic stories. The main problem with this book is that Stephen King is, in my opinion, a great author concering character development. But these developments usually take time, chapter, and pages. King's short stories are almost always a step down from his lenghtier works. \\"Four past midnight\\" is no exception. The four premises are good, but every time I finished a story I felt there was something lacking in it.<br />\\"The langoliers\\" - the most fantastic story in the \\"Four past midnight\\", about a plane that goes through a rip in time. This is the story with the best premise, and with the most developed characters, so it is the best story in the book. Graphic descriptions, deaths, thrilling, a good work. 8.0<br />\\"Secret window\\" - this is the basic plot of the recent movie with Johnny Depp. I had high expectations, bu I was let down. It's a simple story, and a little bit obvious. This is an example that, if King should have chosen to develop the plot further, we could end up with a terrific book. The way it is, I didn't like very much. 6.5<br />\\"The library policeman\\" - Once again, a plot dealing with fantasy and terror. This story has all the elements to be great, bu t it isn't. When I read it, it became very clear to me that Stephen King started to write one story and ended up with another. The beginning has an almost comic style (as opposed to the somber ending), and there are many characters that were intended to be bigger parts in the plot, but were left aside after the initial chapters. It's cool to see that a story may have a life on its own, but I think in this case there could have been more editing to it. Also, the final is too rushed. This story has too many elements is too few pages. 7.0<br />\\"The sun dog\\" - this could be the best story in the book, because the initial plot was really great. It's about a malfunctioning Polaroid camera, and a ferocious dog that appears in every photograph taken with it. This is the kind of idea that makes SK one of my favorite authors, but, as happens with the previous two stories, \\"The sun dog\\" lacks strenght in the end. 7.5<br />So, \\"Four past midnight\\" is a good collection of short stories, but Stephen King has written many better books than this one.<br />Grade 7.5ed.

During that year's Passover celebration, the christian population in Lisbon revolted against the jews, and many atrocities were commited. Zarco's uncle, Abraham, a powerful jew and kabbalist, was involved in many irregular activities. During the riots, Berekiah's life is turned upside down, and, among other things, his beloved uncle is murdered, under mysterious circumstances.<br />Richard Zimler has created a novel based in many layers, characters and situations. Sometimes a little confusing, but always interesting, Zimler guides us since his discovery of the hidden documents written by Zarco centuries ago, to his misfortunes while trying to find his uncle's murderer. The violence contained in the novel is purposedly very graphic, so that the reader can relate to what happened during the period. Most of his characters are complex, but, even if the story is narrated in first person, I felt detached from Berekiah, the main character, paying attention to other characters, more interesting in my opinion.<br />Zimler has written a story that is really a \\"whodunnit\\", mixed with the fictional account of one of the most unhappy times in human history. I liked it and recommend it, although it is a little too dense to become \\"popular\\".<br />Grade 8.0/10	2004-06-25

What Walter Wangerin did here was to re-tell some (not all) of the central stories depicted in the Bible, to transform it in an easier and more undersandable reading.<br />The first three quarters of \\"The book of God\\" deal with the Old Testament, from Abraham to the Prophets. I liked this part because of the simplicity in which it was written; Wangerin did a good job, telling a nice, sequential story. But there are some problems. He kept using endless streams of seemingly unrelated family names, and at times he tries to create parts with biblical poetic resemblance, and that didn't work for me. That's the main problem with this book: it's too flat, to linear, it lacks an author's desire of creating a unique book.<br />The final chapters deal with the life of Jesus. Wangerin only writes what we know it's in the Gospels. He almost doesn't extrapolate. I thought he could have dared more, writing things somewhat different from what we read in the Gospels without diverging from the story, but he didn't. Don't get me wrong, \\"The book of God\\" is not a bad book. But it's not what I expected it to be. It's not vibrant, and at times almost dull.<br />Grade 6.8/10	2004-05-24

From the rock formation, to its inherent animals, and, afterwards, the people - indians, english, german, russian, italian, japanese, Michener presents us with a lesson in writing, describing the arid landscapes, the flat, ugly Platte river, the majestic Rockies, the beaver trappers, the search for gold, the extermination of a race, the cattle ranchers. What more can I say about a book that's more than a thousand pages long and even so a very pleasant reading, never tiresome?<br />Centennial, the focal point of the book, is an imaginary town, but very vivid in my mind. That's the power of Michener's storytelling. He was able to provide his readers with a great cast of characters, this time spanning a little more than three centuries. Blending history with things as different as, for example, dry-land farm technincs, Michener gives us a fantastic lesson about the United States.<br />James Michener is one of my favorite authors, and, in my humble opinion, one of the great writers of the 20th century. We have to mourn his passing because Michener is that rare kind of author, the kind that have his readers always on his mind, always respectful, doing excellent researches, providing historical fiction like no one else. Thank you, Mr. Michener, wherever you are.

Bob Lee is, no doubt, an excellent character. Hunter made him completely believable, and that's the most important thing about a good character. A Vietnam veteran, Swagger now lives in peace at his reclused home in rural Arkansas. Bob Lee is an experting in snipe shooting, general weapons and living in isolation. Suddenly, a shadowy military organization lures him into advising them how to catch another sniper, who may try to kill the president at a speech. Bob Lee is framed, and, wounded, has to run to save his life; only one man can help him: an FBI agent, on leave, himself an ex-sniper, living with the ghosts of his past mistakes.<br />The story is not new, it has been used for a long time. However, Hunter's easy writing, believable characters, fast-paced pursuits, and, most of all, the tense moments of sniper action make this a great book. What's best, Stephen Hunter has (so far) written six books featuring the Swagger family. From what I've read on other reviews, each one of them is great. Hunter has accomplished what all thriller authors want, but few are able to do: an action thriller filled with enjoyable characters, with a touch of psycholgical warfare thrown in the middle.<br />I'll surely read other books by Stephen Hunter.<br />Grade 9.0/10	2004-05-11

It is set during the beginning of the Second Intermediate Period of Ancient Egypt, when the Hyksos dominated the region for some centuries. The plot of the book is the struggle of the Upper Egypt Dinasty against the usurper of the Lower Egypt, and then against the foreign invaders, all seen through the actions and thoughts of the members of the ruling clan.<br />The main character is Taita, an eunuch slave to the important family of the Pharaos' dinasty. I've read and heard some people complain about Taita's cleverness, wisdom and resourcefulness. I don't think so. I like to think of Taita as the Leonardo da Vinci of his age. From time to time such people are born, illuminating their epochs, and legating their achievements to humanity. Taita is obviously a fictional character, but he could have existed. Taita is a good friend, teacher, physician, general, and he knows it. And yet, the reader can't help but liking him, even admirign him, and wonder wht he'll accomplish next.<br />Wilbur Smith's book may not be the most historically accurate, but this time I didn't care. Aside from Taita, his other characters (the Queen Lostris, the Prince Memnon, Tanus, among others), the descriptions of the Nile and its surroundings, and the incredible fast pace of the book, all of that added to make this reading a great pleasure.

I wanted to read Casino Royale because it is the only Bond book that was not made into a movie - if you don't consider the spoof movie with Peter Sellers, David Niven and Woody Allen.<br />To my surprise, in the books Bond is not the ultimate undestructible human being. He's a common enough person, who almost vomits when he sees the remains of a man who just exploded. Also, he is not that comfortable around women, he thinks about quitting his double-oh position, and he has a problem about being good or being evil. Surprising, huh? The biggest surprise is that he doesn't kill a single person in the entire book.<br />What I liked about \\"Casino Royale\\" was watching the developing of one of the greatest characters of the 20th century, as the author imagined him. The story is simple enough, about financialy breaking a communist agent in a french casino. Fleming writes simply, directly to the reader. There's a touch of the \\"noir\\" fashion - the sarcasm, the perfect women - and an unquestionable feeling of the fifties.<br />\\"Casino Royale\\" is a fast, simple read, and necessary to understand the Bond-universe.<br />Grade 8.0/10	2004-04-30

If you have not yet read the first book, you shouldn't read this one. \\"The arctic incident\\" is, without a doubt, a sequel to \\"Artemis Fowl\\", with the same characaters, and developments that come from the first part of the series.<br />In the second book, Colfer chose to show his famous anti-hero genious boy as an anti-villain. Fowl is not portrayed as the evil kid I expected him to be when I started reading the book. In fact, I thought the series would become darker with each new book released, but after these first two stories I think that's unlikely. Fowl is still the central character, but now he must divide the reader's attention with a bigger participation of Captain Short, Commander Root, and even Butler and Potrus. Fowl will always be the \\"hero\\" of his books, but the cool thing about him is that he's a crooked hero, an evil, selfish kid with interesting plans to acheive what he wants. In this book, Artemis Fowl's role was a little too shallow, and he was portrayed, most of the times, as a good and sharing person; I didn't like that very much. Fowl's charm is being evil and selfish in a decent way, and that didn't happen in this book.<br />\\"The arctic incident\\" is actually two plots together in the same story: Artemis Fowl wants to rescue his father from the russian Mafiya, but he needs the help and the technology of the Fairy People; to achieve that, he must, for his turn, help Root and Short to interrupt a coup-d'etat in the underworld. But the arctic part, the story involving Artemis' father, is much smaller than the underground part. Eoin Colfer's writing style continues to be easy to read and enjoyable, with some funny parts and a good display of well-developed and interesting characters. I only wished his future books were a little darker and with more complex plots.<br />The first book is slightly better than this one.<br />Grade 8.0/10	2004-04-23

All elements stated above were, at least for me, more than enough reason to buy this book. I bought it, read it and enjoyed every minute I spent on it.<br /><br />Are the ideas on the book original? Clearly not. But, in fact, Brown mentions some of the inspiration-works to his book in the text: \\"Holy blood Holy Grail\\" is one example, cited at least three or four times.<br /><br />Are the characters ill-developed and somewhat flat? A little, but once you're engaged in read this book, this won't matter a bit.<br /><br />Are the facts depicted in the book true? I don't know, and I think neither does Brown, but in order for his book to sell, and in order for it to be convincing, Brown HAD to create a book  based on the premise that all those facts are true. Anyway, what made me like \\"The Da Vinci code\\" was not only the possibility that all those ideas might be the truth, but the fact that Brown collected all of them, organized them, created a very nice conspiracy theory around them, and delivered us a great fictional book.<br /><br />Saying \\"The Da Vinci code\\" is: bad; unconvincing; impossible; improbable; etc.-etc.-etc. is like saying, for example, that the Indiana Jones movies series are likewise. It's only justificative is: lack of imagination. Hidden facts, obtuse meanings, ancient codes, they exist for us, common mortal beings, to toy with them, to wonder if they are real, what their secret meanings are. Brown did it, and I'm grateful he did. I enjoyed his book immensely. Even the ending, usually the weak point in works of this nature, satisfyed me.<br /><br />Anyway, Dan Brown knows how to write fiction, and he knows how to deliver an excellent fictional book about a subject that gets everybody interested and discussing it in several circles. The sales charts are there to prove it. Bear that word in mind: FICTION. This is what it is. Brown accomplished what he wanted. Good or bad (you can believe what you want) his book is still at the top of the charts, and his future books will also certainly be number-one best-sellers.

Those who love it do so because of the beautiful prose, the interesting philosophical implications and discussions, and the unusual frame of mind of the characters. Those who hate it do so because of the difference between \\"The island of the day before\\" and Eco's other fiction books, \\"The name of the rose\\", \\"Foucault's pendulum\\" and \\"Baudolino\\". \\"The island...\\" seems more like an essay.<br />The book begins telling how Roberto della Grive became stranded in a deserted ship on the other side of the world, and what his mission there was. Two thirds of the story are a description of Roberto's early life, a war, his passage through Paris, a platonic love affair and a conversation with Cardinal Mazarino. The final third tells how Roberto, alone in the ship with the unreachable island across the 180º meridian in front of him, slowly looses his mental faculties, creating a new, imaginary life for himself and disussing with no one about the size of the universe and thinking if the moon is inhabited or not.<br />This book is a combination of historical fiction with philosophy class. But I think Eco would not be my favourite teacher. Sometimes he simply tires the reader with endless discussions about uninteresting topics. However, there's no denying \\"The island of the day before\\" is, for the most part, a good book, extremely well written and very beautiful.

Although \\"Band of brothers\\" is fundamented and researched in actual history, this book feels more like a collection of chronicles and memoirs of the Company paratroopers. That's why it reads more like a society history than a lesson in history. (...) Band of brothers\\" is based on human memories and recollections, and it was intended to be so from the start, not a detailed account of battles, war tactics, etc.<br />Ambrose's writing is light and makes the reader comfortable with what he's reading.

Thomas Malory's \\"Morte D'Arthur\\" is (maybe) the best known book on King Arthur. T H White chose not to re-write Malory's book, and he chose not to write just one more book about the Arthurian dwellings; instead, he wrote his own, personal account of the legend.<br />\\"The once and future king\\" is ironic, sarcastic, moralistic, pacisfist and defends globalization (yes, forty years \\"globalization\\" became a fashionable word). First of all, it's set on the XVth century, much later than the original time for Arthurian legends. The usual characters are present, but they are very different from what we're used to. White focuses on characters, sometimes to the point of forgeting to describe the settings and what is happening between conversations: it's almost like a play. White lets the reader's imagination run wild. In the end, as a final comic touch, Malory becomes a characters in White's book.<br />The strong point of \\"The once and future king\\" is that it's very original, creating a new atmosphere for a battered story - like Marion Zimmer Bradley's masterpiece \\"The mists of Avalon\\" did more recently. The low point of this book is that sometimes it is boring to the point of skipping pages.<br />Anyway, this book was a surprise - a good one - for me.<br />Grade 8.0/10	2004-04-07

To their rescue come two other human beings, Ravna, an ex-bureaucratic low-profile agent, and Pham, who has been dead for the past 25,000 years. This is just a ridiculous, tiny description of what this book is about. Vernor Vinge's descriptions and discussions about his own ideas, thrown in in the middle of the story, are the core of a different and very enjoyable work in science-fiction.<br />\\"A fire upon the deep\\" represented something new for me. Written almost 13 years ago, Vernor Vinge's book was able to show me, during the chapters, some of the most thought-provoking ideas I've ever read in the genre. I would consider \\"A fire upon the deep\\" a great blend of the hardest sci-fi with the necessary \\"human\\" elements that fill a space opera.<br />Vinge's immagination concerning the division of the Galaxy in Zones of Thought is simply amazing. The last time I came upon something so different and intriguing was with Asimov's \\"End of eternity\\". Also, Vinge's description of alien races rival those of (once again) Asimov's \\"The gods themselves\\". But I have to admit that \\"A fire upon the deep\\" reaches a larger scale than the one in Asimov's mentioned books.<br />This is the kind of work that makes people get interested in science-fiction, and also the kind of work that makes science-fiction a respected literature genre. But a warning: this is not a book to be read lightly or with lack of attention.<br />Grade 9.2/10	2004-03-30

Thankfully, it has all the good elements I found in \\"Blood work\\". I enjoy reading police-investigation thrillers, and I like series that feature the same character, if the character is good. Harry Bosch is a good character in the sense that he is a bitter and somewhat unlucky man, which gives him a closeness to the reader; he's not a super-hero and he's certainly full of flaws, like everybody we know. But he's not the common anti-hero, because he's a terrific investigator, and respected as such.<br />In this first book in the Harry Bosch series, the LA detective comes along a body in a pipe by the Holywood reservoir. Overdose? Homicide? What Bosch knows for sure is the identity of the deceased man, who served with him as a \\"tunnel rat\\" in Vietnam, twenty years before. With the help of FBI agent Eleanor Wish, Bosch soon starts to discover that this \\"tunnel\\" is much deeper than he thinks.<br />Connelly won the Edgar Award for debut novel with \\"The black echo\\". His writing style is simple and confident, as a former journalist's should be. He doesn't waste the reader's time, everything that's in the pages has some significance, but his writing is not as tellegraphic as James Patterson's, for example. Connelly created a good character and provided him with very good plot, environment and psychology. It could hardly go wrong, and it didn't.<br />Bosch's books will now be a constant on my shelf.<br />Grade 8.8/10	2004-03-29

James Webb's \\"Fields of fire\\" was my first choice because of the high-rated reviews and praising I found everywhere I looked for information on this book.<br />James Webb was in Vietnam, so he knows what he's writing about. His style is simple and direct; he didn't intend to create a poetic or philosophical book about the war. \\"Fields of fire\\" is a very graphic and accurate portrait of the real people who fought against the vietnamese. Characters are not stereotyped, but rather a display of the many kinds of men who were in SE Asia, and their different motivations or reasons to be there at the time. Interestingly, there are not that many battle scenes, but rather the plot of the book is a fabric of human behaviour during a war, with occasional fighting and changes thrown in the middle.<br />This book is considered very good because the reader can sense that everything in the pages is real. Another thing comes to my mind now: the final chapter (and the ending) is one of the most sensitive, believable and, therefore, appropriated final moment of a book dealing with war that I've ever read.<br />Congratulations to the author, who created a fine book about a gruesome subject. This is one more lesson about humanity in a society that seems to be flunking Citizenship 101.<br />Grade 9.3/10	2004-03-23

The most interesting thing about this trilogy is that it focus on a subject that is almost forgotten in historical fiction: the Inca civilization. That alone is reason to buy the trilogy, for those who are interested in the subject.<br />2. The books are a blend of accurate history and a somewhat corny and water-and-sugar clicheed love story; there are better books on similar subjects, like Gary Jennings' \\"Aztec\\" and Collen MacCullough's \\"First man in Rome\\" series.<br />3. The authors chose to portrait too many characters, sometimes confusing the readers, especially when concerning Inca characters. Excluding the Sapa Incas, the other native pre-columbian characters are almost always variations on the same one.<br />4. When Gabriel, the spanish central character, is not part of the plot, the chapters just drag along, many times boring and tiresome. Anamaya, the main Inca character, lacks strenght.<br />5. As I read the books, I realised the trilogy starts very well, but ends badly. This should not be a trilogy, but only one book, better edited, with a better-developed plot. The authors focused too much on dead-end fictional characters, while historical figures, when they appeared, were always portraied as evil people.<br />The third part is very similar to the first two, and the three books should be read as one.<br />After closing this third book, I felt I liked the trilogy, but could have enjoyed it more, due to the reasons stated above. But as this is the only (as far as I know) fictional account of the Inca civilization, it should get the attention of historical-fiction addicts.<br />Grade 8.0/10	2004-03-16

Nowadays we hardly see an author's commitment with his project as James Michener has done with most of his books. \\"Hawaii\\", \\"Caribbean\\", \\"Texas\\", \\"Alaska\\" and \\"Chesapeake\\", among others, show such a level of research, understanding of the subject and respect to the readers that most modern (and popular) authors would never understand or know how to do it.<br />Michener's \\"The covenant\\" is a history lesson without having to attend class. South Africa is the subject of this lecture. From the indigenous people, to the Dutch and posterior English colonization, and finally the heinous apartheid regime, South Africa is dissected, analyzed and explained. Once again, Michener doesn't concentrate on people, but on the land. The characters are a little stereothypical, but that's on purpose: Michener uses his characters to explain what happens in a determined historical period. What is best, Michener was able to distanciate himself from the controversial history of this country; he presents the facts, good or bad, whether caused by Afrikaner, English or Native Black people, and lets the reader judge for himself.<br />One other thing we have to remember: the book ends in 1979, before De Klerk increasingly opened the country to democracy, so the final chapter of the book sounds almost prophetic.<br />And one thing I didn't understand is that Nelson Mandela wasn't mentioned even once in the book; that's strange. Mandela hadn't yet been released from prison in 1979 and maybe didn't have the same international exposure, but he certainly had been representative as a member of the ANC in the 50s and 60s. Michener created a character that goes through the same problems as Mandela did in real life, but that's not enough to represent  South Africa's first black president .<br />Anyway, Michener is one of my favorite authors, and his passing away should be mourned by all those who enjoy an accurate historical fiction.<br />Grade 9.4/10	2004-03-12

In \\"24 hours\\", it's the kidnapping of a child. OK, this is not an original theme; in fact, it's a pretty used one.<br />But Greg Iles' originality lies on the fact that he has created completely believable characters. While reading the book, I kept saying: \\"Well, now I'd do like this... now I'd do like that...\\" and the characters did pretty much the same thing I was thinking. No idiotic heroism, not improbable and endless plot twists, no last-minute deus-ex-machina intrusions. Only in the final chapter what happens is a little unbelievable, but by that time the reader is so gripped by the story that it becomes a minor affair.<br />Greg Iles likes to lay down many conflicting elements early in his books, and keeps toying with them along the pages. This sweeps the reader attention from page one. In \\"24 hours\\" it happens again. Iles is one of the very good recent surprises in this genre of fiction. I hope he keeps up the good work, and he'll have me as a constant buyer and reader of his books.<br />Grade 9.0/10	2004-03-05

Jack Sawyer is a twelve-year-old boy that must set on a western course through the USA and the fabled, dream-like Territories in order to retrieve the Talisman, an unidentified object that can save his dying mother and her \\"double\\", the queen of the Territories.<br />Once again, Stephen King excells when writing about children. Jack Sawyer is the same age of the main characters in \\"It\\", and, although not as richly developed, a fantastic kid as well. There are other interesting characters in the story, good ones and bad ones alike. They are a little too stereothypic, but as this is a work of fantasy, it fits.<br />In the end, \\"The Talisman\\" is a very nice book, predictable at times, thrilling at others, sometimes merry, sometimes sad. I don't think it was too long, I think the authors took their time to write a complete book while having fun at it. And they did a good job. In fact, I already bought \\"Black house\\", showing Jack Sawyer as a grown-up.<br />On final word to Dark Tower fans: \\"The talisman\\" is a standalone, and has little to do with Roland's saga. The only thing in common is the fact that the \\"Territories\\" are medieval-like and desolate. Otherwise, \\"The talisman\\" has little to do with the Dark Tower. So far.

In the back cover, the text was the same as one of the editorial reviews stated in this page, the one that ends with: \\"... and his name is Jesus Christ\\".<br />So I thought: relics theft, worldwide plague, human cloning, and Jesus Christ all in the same story. These are elements that could make a book great. I Bought it.<br />After reaching the end of the book, I was very disappointed. The back cover text is not true at all. \\"Year zero\\" is not an adventure nor a thriller, but more like a philosophical text about a world that was devastated by an ancient plague and the effort by those who were spared to quickly find a cure. Although Long's writing style is not bad, his plot and his characters are dull and boring. After the first 100 pages, which are indeed very interesting and set a premise that could be much more well developed, it's all downhill.<br />There are many books dealing on apocalypse-like and dead-end-for-humanity situations and many of them are better than \\"Year zero\\": \\"The stand\\", \\"On the beach\\" are just two of them.<br />If the editors had not wanted to create an adventure-like atmosphere to this book, maybe I would have set my mind on a different frame-reading, and then I could have enjoyed it much more.

This is clearly a product of the Cold War times (close to its end, in fact - circa 1988), but the plot is still compelling and thrilling, after 16 years.<br />Major Sam Hollis and press atache Lisa Rhodes are two of the hundreds of people working on the US embassy in Moscow. Deceit, provocation, threatening, all this is part of their lives, since the KGB won't take it easy on american personnel working on russian soil. When a young tourist inadvertently walks on the biggest secret of Mother Russia, Hollis and Rhodes are swept in a turmoil that will certainly end in death - unless they outsmart thousands of Komitet employees, and one in special: the unusually violent Colonel Burov.<br />Maybe DeMille's creation is the definite fictional work on russian-american relations during the final stages of the Cold War. His depiction of Moscow and russian citizens is very vivid. The main characters are memorable, especially the despicable villain, Burov. The final chapters of the book are astonishing, fast paced, chases, ruses - the usual DeMille stuff.<br />I put \\"The charm school\\" along with \\"Plum island\\" and \\"The gols coast\\" as DeMille's best books.<br />Grade 9.1/10	2004-02-19

Vinge won the acclaimed Hugo Award with this re-telling of a Hans Christiansen Andersen story, set in a futuristic universe, where the Planetary Empire has fallen, and the Hegemony rules over some planets, keeping them out of the technological ring with the help of its governants.<br />Arienhrod, the Snow Queen, is one of such governants, ruling the Winter in planet Tiamat. But the time of the Change has come, and Arienhrod has to step down from her throne. To prevent this, she creates a clone, named Moon, one of the summer people (who will rule Tiamat after the Change has been completed), and expects Moon to help her keep her high place.<br />The plot is much more complicated than that, with lots of twists and many well-composed characters. Tiamat and its main city, Carbuncle, is also interesting, as is the governing system, the interaction between Tiamat and the Hegemony, the religious system of the planet and some other things.<br />And yet, I couldn't bring myself to fully enjoy this book. Not that I didn't want to. I think what I didn't enjoy was Vinge's style of writing: it is too academic and slow. I was able to glimpse the beauty behind a layer of intelectual mist, but Vinge's sentences and chapters couldn't make me see the complete colors of her story. Unfortunately, I only kept reading because I thought there was some improvement toward the end. There was not.<br />I'm certain this is a good book, but was wasted on me.<br />Grade 6.0/10	2004-02-16

I think \\"Lord Valentine's castle\\" is more in the fantasy realm, but Silverberg accomplished, in this acclaimed book, a great blend of both. The story, the names, the characters, all have a big resemblance to Tolkien's work, but Majipoor is a world that stands on its own.<br />The story is simple, a quest in fact: Valentine \\"wakes  up\\" as a thirty-year-old man whose past is misty and pratically lost. In Majipoor, a giant planet, metal-poor, and home to more than 20 billion people of diverse races (humans and aliens), Valentine travels hundreds of thousands of miles, gathering interesting characters around him, trying to disclose who he was, and what has been stolen from him.<br />Many other reviewers state that Valentine's quest has little and simple difficulties, and that's right. His group has many problems along the way, but every time they resolve it quickly and thoroughly. I think the main feature Silverberg accomplished in this work is to present Majipoor and its people. The governing system, the grandness of scale, the unusual situations and most of the characters are really interesting, and the reader can't help but like them, in one way or another. But sometimes, due to the number of characters existing on the story, some of them disappear for many pages, only to come back again, in minor passages, as if the author suddenly remembered about them.<br />The only thing that doesn't fit is the lenght of the book. Suddenly, it's all over. Silverberg could have developed the last two chapters of the book in a more complete fashion, adding another couple of hundred pages, and the book wouldn't be too long.<br />Anyway, this is one of the best ideas I've come along regarding fantasy/sci-fi.

But this time the protagonist is a woman, not a man. But the differences stop there. Katie Carr is entering her forties, and midlife crisis has arrived early for her. She wants to divorce her suddenly-crazy husband, but lacks courage to do so. Her family is falling apart, strangers come to live in her house, and her medical practice is full of lunatic people. With that many problems, she spends the whole book trying how to be cool.<br />The problem is, Hornby is repeating himself. In this third book, there's nothing new, unless you count the fact that a woman is the central character - but that woman looks incredibly like the previous male characters. In fact, most of the story is simply boring and, at times, pointless. Katie keeps telling the readers she's a good person, while her actions contradict her every time. OK, \\"How to be good\\" could be an ironic work. But if it's so, the irony escaped me.<br />There's no ending to this book. I think Hornby wanted to pass the notion that life goes on, and that most people don't have immediate answers to their problems, but it didn't work for me. After finishing it, I realised \\"How to be good\\" didn't make any difference to me. It's not a bad book, it's not a good book, it's a book to be forgotten.<br />Grade 5.0/10	2004-02-09

His ending in poverty and short life add to that aura of mistery and curiosity that envolves names like Michelangelo, Mozart and such. The name of the book is also the name of one of the most famous paintings by the XVIIth century, wich is considered the \\"Dutch Monalisa\\". If you have never seen this painting, just look at the cover of the book. Who is that girl? Like DaVinci's Monalisa, no one knows who was the model to Vermeer's almost mystic portrait. That's what author Tracy Chevalier imagines in her story.<br />\\"Girl with a pearl earring\\" is the tale, told in first person, of Griet, the suddenly impoverished girl who spent more than two years as a maid in the Vermeer's household. Griet's arrival is seen with suspicions from the beginning, because she's a protestant, not a catholic like the Vermeers. Four daughters, the wife, the mother-in-law, and an older maid, everybody dislikes the new girl, with the exception of Johannes himseld, a quiet, withdrawn yet intense man; but, with her simple and straightforward way, Griet, little by little, becomes one of the most important people in the house. Read the book and you'll know why.<br />Chevalier's book is, in fact, almost like a Vermeer painting: behind the apparent simplicity lies technic, perception and study. I've seen a few people complain that this book has no plot, no climax, it's dull, etc. Well, my advice is to this people is: stick to your shallow thrillers and gun-fight books. \\"Girl with a pearl earring\\" is a book made for people able to appreciate it.

I haven't watched the movie yet, but I can say the book is very, very good. Lehane is not an usual writer. \\"Mystic river\\" is, in a very shallow analysis, a policial whodunnit. But Lehane's style of writing turned this complex thriller in a psychological trip.<br />In the beginning, there are three friends: Dave, Sean and Jimmy; when they are kids, one of them has a traumatic experience, and after that, their lives will be forever changed. When they grow up, their relationship is cold, distant, and then the daughter of one of them is murdered. The mistery is to solve who killed the girl. But this book is much more than that.<br />Lehane's development of his characters is extreme, especially the psychological part. But Lehane is never explicit. Many things are understated and hidden from the reader, but that doesn't mean the author pulls rabbits out of his hats in order to mantain the reader's attention. There's no magic here, just a well told story that gripped me from the first chapter. After I finished the book, I realised it was one of the most real stories I've ever read.<br />It's heavy, it's in-your-face, and it's good.<br />Grade 9.0/10	2004-01-21

At times, it is confusing, and this book clearly requires a commiment from the reader; otherwise the story is filled with such crazyness that the unnatentive reader may loose interest in the book. But, believe me, there's order and method in this crazyness.<br />Tim Powers seems to me an author blessed with an immense immagination to create different and fantastic stories, and this book is one good example.

To capture all these matters in a correct way in just one book is a task that's simply impossible. However, I feel that Errol Lincol Uys knew that, and what he has done in his book is to create a \\"big picture\\"of Brazil, and that was the right thing to do. His research and knowledge of the portuguese language are impressive for a non-brazilian, although there are many mistakes, in both aspects. When these mistakes were relative to the language, I found them completely normal, because portuguese is a very difficult and complexe language, even more difficult for someone who comes from a non-latin-speaking  country. When the mistakes were relative to brazilian history and its further development, I was angry at first, but then I realised that Uys, as a foreigner, had access mostly to the \\"normal\\" and \\"adjusted\\" history of my country. Every country has its \\"adjusted\\" history, the history full of martyrs, dramatic situations, sword duels, fights for freedom, etc. That's the history that Uys tells his readers.<br />One other thing. As many authors dealing with the fictionalized history of a country, Uys makes a common mistake. He simply ignores the latest century. As a consequence, the book pratically ends at the turn of the twentieth century, and many interesting and important things have happened in Brazil in the XX century are left behind: Getulio Vargas, the transition from an agrarian to an industrialized country, the military dictatorship and many, many more. Of course, as I said before, it's impossible to completely cover an entire country's history in just one book, but \\"Brazil\\" could be two- or three-hundred pages longer and it would not be better or worse, just more complete.<br />So, in the end, \\"Brazil\\" is a good start for someone who is interested in the country. The book is mostly accurate and well researched, but it's just a gimpse of what Brasil really is.<br />Grade 8.3/10br />Grade 8.3/10	2004-01-19

For example, the one who is a former CIA special-agent forsaken in a foreign country that has to struggle alone to go back to US and now has turned into a robber because he's against the system. See what I mean? This is not new. In \\"strangers\\", Koontz is an author who has a good writing hability, but lacks immagination.<br />When I reached the end of the book and \\"the truth\\" was revealed, I couldn't help but role my eyes. I won't say anything in order not to spoil the fun for future readers, but if you've read more than 10 books in your life or have watched at least one episode of the \\"X files\\", you know what this book is all about. It's really silly. But there may be an excuse for that. This book was written in the mid-eighties. Maybe in that time this was not so silly. But today it is. \\"Strangers\\" is a book that has not aged well. To counter that, the final chapters are filled with good action and, once more, Koontz's competence as a writer saves what could be an otherwise floppy book.<br />Grade 7.5/10	2004-01-19

So, my expectations with The magic circle were high.<br />The story revolves around Ariel Behn and her heritage, a bunch of historic documents and manuscripts that have a powerful meaning; it seems many people know what those documents mean, but Ariel herself has been left in the dark by her family, and she doesnt know nothing about them. The plot is about Ariel disclosing the documents meaning, while revealing to the reader the many complicated connections between her large and chaotic family (I suggest the reader make notes on the Behn family, otherwise he will be going back on the text to remember who is someones mother, father, cousin, brother, sister, etc.) and another, historical plot, involving Jesus Christ, roman emperors, and Adolf Hitler.<br />The book is good enough, and achieved what I expected. But, in the end, I felt the complicated plot was not entirely well developed. I was left with the feeling that something was missing. I mean, the book doesnt end well. It simply stops. Neville could have used another hundred pages to give the reader a more satisfatory conclusion to the lots of interesting historical facts, information and relations depicted in the story.<br />Otherwise, I have to compliment Katherine Neville, because this book was clearly difficult to write, and her research must have been painfully difficult to provide the accuracy this book clearly has.<br />Grade 8.2/10	2004-01-19

In my opinion, one of the greatest things about Lincoln and Amelia is the feeling of closeness the reader gets when reading about the crippled investigator. Lincoln is always in his state-of-the-art medical bed, surrounded by latest technology forensic equipment, and Amelia is Lincoln's eyes and legs. This combination prooved to be very good and adequate in the first two books.<br />In \\"The empty chair\\", Lincoln and Amelia are not in New York anymore. They have traveled to North Carolina, where Rhyme will undergo a cirurgy that may restore some of his nerve connections. But while wating the cirurgy, the local sheriff asks Lincoln to help him in a murder-kidnapp case. From there, Deaver gives the reader his usually competent plot. The problem is, in this book character development is way below average. It's full of stereotypes. Even Rhyme and Sachs are a little worn out. Other characters are flat and I often confused one with another in the first pages of the book. The final solution of the mistery is simply ridiculous, when you think in Jeffery Deaver's terms. It's the kind of solution used in bad first-books by unknown authors in the eighties. Deaver disappointed me badly with the last hundred pages of \\"The empty chair\\".<br />I hope \\"The stone monkey\\" is much better than this one, because Rhyme and Sachs are too good a team to be forsaken.<br />Grade 6.3/10	2004-01-19

In my opinion, what Tolkien did with hobbits, dwarves, men and elves, Richard Adams has done with rabbits.<br />At first glance, the reader may think: but what's there about rabbits that's so interesting? Of course, \\"Watership down\\" is not just about rabbits at all. Adams only used them as an allegory. But it's been really interesting reading about semi-sentient beings that are not distinguished by their intelligence, but by their tenacious will to survive against stronger enemies and sometimes even against themselves. More than that, Adams was able to create (like Tolkien) a spiritual, holy background for rabbits, permeating his story with nice tales about a smarter-than-most rabbit that lived in ancient times.<br />Richard Adams tells his tale like an old-fashioned myth, like a folded piece of clothing that the reader has to unfold and never stop being amazed by its size and complexity.<br />Grade 9.5/10	2003-12-24

Well, his main character (Jack Ryan) was a good one, with lots of development potential, always in the middle of some interesting spy-situation in the dual world torn apart by the cold war. Besides, his style and competence to describe accurate and believable military conflicts was what captivated millions of readers around the globe.<br />Well, the years passed, lots of books came and went in what is now known as \\"Ryanverse\\". But the quality of the books surely is not the same. What happened?<br />First of all, Ryan is now president, and a veteran of almost ten books. He has nowhere to escalate further, and after ten books there are few development fields for a character: they become repetitive and predictable. Now, Ryan is a boring man, always complaining about being POTUS. What is worse, few new characters are introduced in the series. They are always the same: Clark, Chavez, Golovko, Jackson, Van Damm, etc. etc. The readers are getting tired.<br />Second, Clancy now doesn't write anymore about military, he writes about politics. That would be OK, if the book wasn't 1100 pages long. I mean, who has the patience to wait 950 pages of politic (and sometimes economic) conflicts that go seemingly nowhere before Russia and China engage in a war over oil and gold? I don't have that kind of patiente.<br />Even with all that, this book could be considered average (not like his previous and good books, but still average); but this time Clancy overreacted: every sub-chapter has an ethnic prejudice sentence, and not after long I was tired of the supremacy and intelligence of the americans and the stupidity and craziness of the chinese.<br />In the end, after the war is concluded, the book rushes to an end in less than five pages. I mean, I read more than 1000 pages and this book doesn't even END PROPERLY? Ridiculous. Clancy is clearly doing his own editing and that is always a mistake. Clancy is treating his readers as idiots. And, if I was a chinese I would be very, very angry at Mr. Clancy right now, work of fiction or not. It's very clear the author doesn't know that much about China (or was misinformed, but I don't think that is likely) and created a ridiculous China look-alike with lots of hateful things to instigate that hate on his readers. In my opinion, it backfired, and now Mr. Clancy himself is in a bad position.<br />(...)<br />Grade 4.0/10ders as idiots.

The problem is, after that he was never the same writer again. \\"Shaman\\" was fairly good, \\"The Jerusalem diamond\\" and \\"The death comitee\\" were mildly interesting and \\"The rabbi\\" and \\"Matters of choice\\" were almost unreadable.<br />\\"The last jew\\" is not that bad, but not nearly as good as \\"The Physician\\". The last jew in Spain is Yonah Toledano, living in a time when all jews are to leave the country or become conversos, otherwise they will suffer the tortures of the infamed Inquisition. Yonah's family is scattered early in the book, and he finds himself alone wandering through Spain, pretending to be an old catholic, but never forgetting his jewish background.<br />The story could be interesting. But there's a grave problem with it: it never reaches a climax. There's no conclusion. Gordon has created a plain and constant book, and that's really bad when dealing with fiction. Yonah Toledano is the main character, and he's developed enough, but all other characters simply enter and leave the book with almost no further consequences. So, in the end, while I found \\"The last jew\\" a pleasant reading, I also thought it was a futile one. I hope Gordon's next book will be somewhat improved in style, plot and characters.

In fact, to fully understand the many layers contained between the lines, one reading is not enough. The novel itself is not that much graphic. Dick rarely describes settings, people, buildings, etc., leaving the reader's immagination to work full-time. In fact, is this science fiction? Yes, I think it is, not because of the science involved, but because of the revolutionary elements present in the story.<br />This is mental sci-fi; the main question of the book is: what defines a human being? Rick Deckard has to answer this question every time he retires a Nexus-6, all the time taking care not to loose his bearings of what he thinks a human being should be. This kind of complexity is what makes \\"Do androids...?\\" a great read, although I thought Dick's style a little too dry for my personal taste.<br />Grade 8.2/10	2003-12-16

If you analyse it deeply, it has potential to be one of the most complete and thoughtful works of science fiction ever, but that's not enough to make this book great. The story is set about 1000 years in the future, and as the first sentence in the book says, \\"Man is an endangered species\\", because Earth is now dominated by the Psychlos, a very military powerful alien race that explore mineral resources in planets it dominates, regardless of sentient life pre-existent in those planets. Psychlos are ruthless, violent and self-minded; human race, now down to no more than 50,000 scattered people, is back in an almost neolithic state.<br />Then, enter the scene Jonnie Tyler, the main and pratically only character in the book. This is the first mistake by Hubbard. Tyler, although an interesting character, tires the reader as he goes further in the story. For example, women are treated like ridiculous domestic and winning characters from beginning to end. Tyler is almost like a super-hero that takes upon his back the task of saving the humans. Everything he does, although with lots of risks, will be resolved, one way or another, in the end. No reader can take that lightly after more than 1000 pages. I couldn't.<br />The first 400 pages are very good, dealing with Tyler trying to fool Terl, the main Psychlo on Earth, into sending a bomb back to his home planet. In this first phase, the interaction between Tyler and Terl is enjoyable, and the science matters displayed along the pages are good, although a little repetitive.<br />Then the book looses its pace. Too many uninteresting supporting characters, boring situations dealing mainly with politics and military battles. In the end, everything was a little too confusing, because I was skipping the parts didn't catch my attention (something I rarely do). The fact is, after page 500, Hubbard's style of writing made me loose interest in my own planet's quest for survival!<br />So, I really enjoyed the first part of the story, but the second part was very boring. If you want to read this one, prepare yourself beforehand: this is not a light and fast book to read in the beach.<br />Grade 6.3/10's quest for survival! <br />So, I really enjoyed the first part of the story, but the second part was very boring.

Amundsen, the competent norwegian leader, reached the pole and came back to tell his story; Scott, the controversial british leader, reached the pole but could not come back, and died in the middle of the frozen continent. Amundsen's feat is one of the greatest and cleanest of all human history; Scott's tragic outcome became matter of legend.<br />Human nature and humanity's predilection for heroic (even if useless) accomplishments made Scott widely known, and  made Amundsen a bitter old man unitl his death (surprise!: Amundsen's death, years after he reached the pole, was also kind of heroic and widely useless). When Huntford wrote this book (back in the seventies, if I'm not mistaken), Scott was the hero and Amundsen was \\"that norseman that went to the Pole\\".<br />Huntford's is one of the first books to elevate Amundsen to his real and deserved status. Through almost 30 chapters and more than 600 pages, Huntford compares Amundsen and Scott, not only their polar expeditions, but also their background lives in respective countries, past influences, exploration techniques, people they were related to, and much more. From the beginning, using a compelling writing style (academic but never boring or slow) Huntford paints Scott like a buffoon, a pitiable character driven by dreams of glory and power. Maybe Scott was not as bad as Huntford thinks, and maybe Amundsen was not as godlike as well; the reader has to absorb the huge amount of information about the expeditions contained in this book, and decide for himself if he completely believes the biographical information about Scott and Amundsen. Even so, this book is not for readers with a small capacity and willingness for changing his thoughts about Amundsen and Scott. And, no doubt, Scott's admirers will never go past page 100.<br />This book could be a &quot;Grade:10&quot; if there were photographs of the expeditions included.<br />To complement Huntford's book I would suggest Cherry-Garrard's \\"The worst journey in the world\\", a great account on Scott's side of the exploration. I said \\"complement\\" and not \\"oppose\\".

There are very few fiction books that deal with the beginning of men as a species.<br />Auel's work must be praised because she was able to picture a very vivid Neanderthalian clan; most of what we know today about neanderthals is speculation based on anthropological findings, since they lived in pre-historical times. Auel's researched is very complete and extense, and it shows in her book. Characters, situations, huntings, clan-dealings, everything is easy to imagine and follow as we read, because tha author's style of writing is smooth and visually powerful. This story is, obviously, just another speculation, but a very interesting one.<br />The main character is Ayla. She's not a Neanderthal; she comes from the Others, a different sub-species, more advanced physically and mentally. Ayla lost her parents in an earthquake when she was very small, and was found and rescued by the neanderthalian clan. There, in spite of her differences, she struggles to be accepted and respected as a member of the clan.<br />Auel's book is good because the characters are deeply developed, not only Ayla, but most of the clan people as well. There's a little difficulty for the reader to get acquainted with the unusual names and the function of each clan member, but once past that the reading is great. There's not much action in the story, but it never drags on. The main feature is, no doubt, the relationship between Ayla and the rest of the clan.<br />I hope the other books in the series keep the good writing.<br />Grade 8.8/10	2003-12-09

Notably, he left few paintings, less than forty, and died in poverty, leaving his family full of monetary debts. Since Vermeer usually didn't sign his paintings, it's hard to tell if they are authentic or fakes. Many paintings believed to be Vermeers were discovered to be fakes, and vice-versa.<br />Susan Vreeland's book is in fact a collection of short-stories concerning one immaginary painting by Vermeer, named \\"Girl in hyacinth blue\\". Using the painting as the binding element, she tells the various stories of people who possessed the work of art, beginning in the late 1990s and going back to the time Vermeer painted it.<br />I noticed that many people believe that this book's main theme is to know if Vermeer was really the author of the painting or not. This is wrong. This book is not a whodunnit, but stories of relationships, loss, fear, forgiveness and love. The painting is only the central artifact, but each story has its own distinct characters and situations. Each story is complete in its own way, but I think the author could develop them some more. Or maybe not, maybe the most charming aspect of the book is that it's short.<br />Anyway, a fast, emotive and very enjoyable reading.<br />Grade 8.6/10	2003-11-18

Even if this note was not posted, readers with minimum background on urban violence would recognize Paulo Lins' ability to transport real social problems to the pages of his novel. Lins does not invent anything. In fact, he was one of those people living in a violent urban sorrounding, so this book is a grouping of his past personal experiences mixed with stories he heard while researching his social thesis.<br />Paulo Lins doesn't try to elaborate on language, characters and settings and yet this book is so powerfully written in a colloquial (and realistic) manner that the reader is completely aware of places, people, negotiations and relationships existent in Cidade de Deus. Every sentence has a specific meaning; violence and reality drip off every word.<br />The story is about how crime and violence became the most important part of life in Cidade de Deus, from petty thieving in the beginning, escalating to a globalized war between drug-dealer factions in the end. Colorful characters, addicteds, dealers, thieves, murderers, transsexuals, populate the pages. No character will be good, everybody is a delinquent, but the reader will not stop reading. That's the power behind Cidade de Deus. It's a fiction so full of truth and, to some of the readers, set in such an alien environment, that you just keep turning the pages, faster than alliances and shootings are depicted in the pages.<br />I read this book in its original language, portuguese. It's a very resourceful and complex language, even more so when in colloquial slang, and translators will have to be very careful in order to mantain the books' best parts, such as dialogue, names of the characters, etc.<br />If you have seen the acclaimed movie, the novel is as graphic and as fast-paced.

He receives a summons from his aging father, Judge Atlee, a retired chanceler in Clanton, Mississipi. The Judge is dying and wants to see his son (whose relationship with was never good) once again. When Ray enters his old house, the Judge is dead and he finds more than US$ 3 milion stacked in boxes. What should he do? He can't tell his brother, Forrest, a drug addict that would surely kill himself with that much money. He has no friends. He has no family. And he has no idea where the money came from, since his father was as straight as can be. So, \\"The summons\\" is Ray's quest to know the origin of the money.<br />Q: Is \\"The summons\\" as bad as everybody is saying?<br />A: Well, you have to be careful to answer that. First of all, I can't consider this a novel, it's more like a novella disguised as a novel. It's short, fast to read, few characters, not much time-tracking, etc. Alone, \\"The summons\\" would not be that bad a book, but it is written by John Grisham. As I finished it, I opened and read the first chapters of \\"A time to kill\\", which I think is Grisham's best book. The difference is amazing, to the point that it makes me wonder if it was indeed Grisham who wrote \\"The summons\\". I would give \\"The summons\\" 3 stars, but the ending of the book is too stupid, and the \\"final twist\\" was not  twisty at all. And comparing it to \\"A time to kill\\" only made me angry at the author, who one long time ago knew how to write good novels. \\"The summons\\" is such a recycled material that one of the characters, Harry Rex Vonner, comes indeed from his first book. Why? I can see no reason for that. So, is \\"The summons\\" as bad as everybody is saying? Yes; it has developing potential, though, but the author simply didn't care. \\"The summons\\" is his next-to-worst book, only better than \\"The brethren\\" and as bad as \\"The street lawyer\\".<br />Q: What is happening to John Grisham?<br />A: Man, I don't really know. In my opinion, Grisham is bound to a killer millionaire contract with one publishing house or another, and has to deliver one book per year. He simply lost the pleasure to write. He's writing because he's ordered to, and this shows in a steeply descendent curve of the quality of his later books. In fact, no one has the necessary immagination to deliver a good plot, good characters and a good book once a year.<br />Q: What should I do about Grisham?<br />A: Stop buying his books, of course. Or if you are a fan of his older books, like me, browse your local used-books store once in a while, and see if you find books like \\"The summons\\" and \\"The brethren\\", so your collection is complete. But if everybody keeps making Grisham reach the bestselling list with each new book, the quality of his work will hardly improve.

Along the five stories existent in the book, King blends in his fantasy magna-opus with some touching tales about discovering life during the sixties in US, and how some of the people of that generation deal with the aftermath.<br />The book contains five stories. Although they cover a forty-year span, they are all linked together, even if the main characters change in each story.<br />The first story is \\"Low men in yellow coats\\", which was adapted to a movie starring Anthony Hopkins. This is the story of a summer in Bobby Garfield's life, in 1960, when he met a strange fellow, Ted Brautigan. Ted is much more than he seems to be, and he is running from something he can't tell Bobby about. \\"Low men...\\" is the longest story in the book, and, as previously stated by other reviewers, Dark Tower fans will be delighted to know yet another part of this amazing fantasy saga. Readers who are not aware of Dark Tower may think the story is strange and unbelievable, but it may also be a starting point to get to know Roland and his quest companions.<br />\\"Hearts in Atlantis\\" is the second story, and the best one in my opinion. The main character is Pete Riley, a freshman in UMaine, coping with a new reality - the Vietnam war - and its developments: is the war right or wrong? On what side should he be? The portrayal of entering adult life in the sixties is very good and the character development is, once again, excellent. The fantasy elements don't appear in \\"Hearts...\\", and this story is as \\"reality\\" as it can be.<br />The two next tales, \\"Blind Willie\\" and \\"Why we're in Vietnam\\" are not as compelling as the first two, and much shorter. In each one of them, there's pratically only one character, and the stories deal with experiences and post-war consciences.<br />\\"Heavenly shades of night are falling\\" is the last one, only twenty pages long, and here we meet Bobby Garfield again, now as an adult that comes back to his childhood town. It's a good wrap-it-up story to the book, but could be more developed. As happens with everything concerning the Dark Tower, there are lots of unanswered questions, leaving the reader in near-despair concerning the conclusion of the saga.<br />Stephen King delivers in \\"Hearts in Atlantis\\" a different pattern of writing.

Once again, the CID investigator has a complicated case in his hands. He must return to Vietnam (where he made two tours, in 1968 and 1972) and disclose an US army murder that happened in Quang Tri almost thirty years ago. To accomplish that, he must find an ex-north-vietnamese soldier that witnessed the whole thing but disappeared since then. The problem is, Vietnam (especially the northern part of the country) doesn't see american veterans with good eyes, so Brenner must be very cautious not to arise suspicions over his person. To help him, he will have the company of Susan Weber, an exotic lady that works for an american company in vietnamese soil. But Susan seems to be much more than she shows.<br />All DeMille's usual elements are there: sarcasm, witty moments, a murder, politics involved, a beautiful woman, sex, and more. But \\"Up Country\\" is more than that, and a little different from his other books.<br />The story is very slow. Most of the 850 pages portrait Brenner through his ancient battlegrounds in Vietnam, and many chapters, as he goes up north in the asiatic country, describe his old war experiences and how he was affected by them, even if he doesn't want to admit it. In fact, the murder investigation is resolved in no more than 50 pages. The thrilling moments sum up to no more than 200 pages. The rest is an account of how is the modern Vietnam - through the eyes of an american, of course -, mixed with intelligent dialogue and good characters - Paul Brenner is very similar to John Corey from \\"Plum Island\\" and \\"Lion's game\\", although more serious and businesslike. And yet, even with all the readers' complaints about \\"Up country\\" being more a travel guide than a thriller, I liked this book. It's not DeMille's best, not like \\"The gold coast\\" or \\"Plum Island\\", but it's very enjoyable. And the ending leaves room to another Paul Brenner book. \\"Up country\\" may not be, although, the best book to start reading DeMille. In fact, a beginner should read his books in chronological order of the release dates.<br />Grade 8.1/10ok. \\"Up country\\" may not be, although, the best book to start reading DeMille.

Now, on the verge of the 21th century, his father is missing, his mother is half-crazy and the money is beginning to shorten. Artemis, with the help of faithful servants, the Butlers, devises a plan to steal some money - gold - from the Fairy People. The Fairy People, composed of dwarves, centaurs, goblins, trolls, and, of course, fairies, live in the underground, away from human eyes - the Mud People. They have magic, spells and a very good technological environment to ensure a quiet living in the nether regions. To prevent Artemis from stealing their gold, enter the scene Captain Holly Short and Commander Root, two of the foremost people in the LEPrecon, the police force of the Fairies.<br />To continue with the review, I will compare Artemis with Harry Potter - mainly HP's first book. This can and should be done because both books were released only few years apart, both are directed to pre-adolescent and teenager readers and both have similar protagonists. While Harry Potter's nature is good and even naive, Artemis Fowl is dark, plotish and ambushing. He rarely makes mistakes. Potter is a loner, at least in the beginning of the series, and Fowl is the thinking head of a company of crooks. Thus, Fowl's universe is darker. But Artemis, even being a kid-thief, is the main character of the story, and if the readers didn't like him, the series would be a flop. That's the biggest difficulty faced by author Colfer: he must keep his choice of creating an evil character, imagine coherent evil things he will do, and still be able to make the readers relate to Artemis in a good way. Colfer made it, at least in this first book.<br />The magical, fairy-peopled world created by Colfer is also very different from Rowling's non-muggler world. Here, there's no ultimate evil - Voldemort - because evil is personyfied by Artemis. Goblins, trolls and dwarves still are plenty - the Tolkien legacy - but in HP the setting is always the magical world of Hogwarts, while in AF the real world and the magical world are depicted together, and that may be not so easy to get into the reader's mind.<br />Which leads us to the jackpot question: which is better, Fowl or Potter? First of all, we have to consider Colfer's genious touch, creating an EVIL character, in contrast to the always righteous Harry Potter. This is a very intelligent twist and even a challenge to the irish author creative vein. I think Rowling created a more complex and developed universe, settings and characters in her masterpiece. But I must not forget that I have read HP's 4 books, and this is my first from AF series. Maybe the next Artemis books will provide the development and complexness that somewhat lacked in the first one.<br />Nevertheless, \\"Artemis Fowl\\" is the work of a talented author and a sure fun reading. No doubt I wish to know Artemis' future adventures.<br />Grade 8.3/10- the Tolkien legacy - but in HP the setting is always the magical world of Hogwarts, while in AF the real world and the magical world are depicted together, and that may be not so easy to get into the reader's mind. <br />Which leads us to the jackpot question: which is better, Fowl or Potter?

Hornby's detached, uncompromised style is a relief. The reading is very light and entertaining. The question that remains is: who is the \\"boy\\" in the title?<br />Marcus is a son of separated parents. His father is a far-away jerk. His mother is a suicuidal, depressed hippie (!). He just moved to London, and he is not doing very well in school, and in fact he's not doing very well in life. He has the wrong clothes, the wrong hair, he's a vegetarian, and has no friends. On the other hand, Will Freeman (a little too obvious name) is a 36-year-old who has no job because he is rich enough to afford a pacate life. He has no family, no children, and only shallow friends. His non-life objective is to meet women so he can take them to bed. Marcus and Will meet and they help each other to achieve a better living to both of them, taking their lives and using what's best in them.<br />The portuguese title of this book is \\"Um grande garoto\\", which, when put in english, has two meanings: \\"A great boy\\" and \\"A big boy\\". The portuguese title is the summary of the book. \\"About a boy\\" is about two boys: one, a grown-up living the life every kid would want, but he's getting tired of it; the other, a kid living his life with the seriousness and responsibilities of a grown-up, and he's alreay tired of it.<br />Hornby's universe is very pontual, small, but his characters and the relationships between them are very complex, and that's what makes his books so unforgettable. Hornby has re-defined pop-culture, adding to it a new meaning and the face of the nineties.<br />Grade 8.9/10	2003-10-27

Hornby is one of the two british people that has brought a new meaning to pop-culture; the other is Helen Fielding. Hornby's characters are simple, common people that live unusual situations and relationships along his common lives. In this case, Hornby's character is himself, and the book is about his relationship with London soccer team Arsenal.<br />To me this book was fun to read because, like Hornby - although in a much, much smaller degree - I am a soccer fanatic, and, like him, my favourite team  - Corinthians Paulista - is also one of the most popular and inconstant teams in my country. Hornby writes his book describing how his life was related to Arsenal's achievements. When Arsenal was doing good, Hornby was doing good. When Arsenal was struggling, Hornby was in depression. Of course, there's much more to it than just that, but it is interesting to observe the development of Hornby's obsession, because it can happen to anyone, at any time.<br />The problem with \\"Fever pitch\\" is that, if the reader doesn't like or doesn't know soccer there will be a lot of skipped paragraphs, and maybe the book will be put aside before the end. Even if the reader can see this story as a metaphor, soccer is ever-present and cannot be dissociated from Hornby's life. I liked it and understood it because soccer IS a very present thing in my life. Maybe if it was about cricket, I would not have liked it.<br />Grade 8.8/10	2003-10-27

One is a highly, almost humanly intelligent golden retriever, with the usual dog sweetness and companionship; the other escapee is something like the experiments in \\"The island of Dr. Moreau\\", with a dark deathwish and incredible hate towards the intelligent dog. This monster is also very mentaly capable, and will stop to nothing until he finds his prey. Between them, two solitary people, a man and a woman, will come togheter, and their lives will change forever.<br />This is the a summary of Dean Koontz's \\"Watchers\\". I have only recently discovered this author's books, and \\"Watchers\\" is the second one I read from him, after the very enjoyable \\"Lightning\\". Based on Amazon.com reviews and on \\"Lightning\\", I was eagerly waiting to read \\"Watchers\\", but the final result came shorter from what I was expecting.<br />Although the plot is neither original nor too much believable, it could be very fun, because this is a work of fiction. If I  wanted reality, I would read Stephen Ambrose - a very good author. But the way Koontz treated his book was not very interesting. The main human characters are too much alike. Other characters enter and exit the book much too fast, and when they were part of the plot, I couldn't relate to them, because of their shallowness. The contract killer, the NSA cops, the lawyer, all were uninteresting and yet important - and boring - parts in the book. This was an error. The intelligent dog, Einstein, is the best thing in the story. But there is a huge mistake in its conception. Without wanting to give anything away, if the scientists were able to work the dog's genoma and make him intelligent, why the hell weren't they able to prevent it to suffer from such a common dog's disease like cinomosis??<br />This is what I'm talking about. Koontz imagined a story with a high potential to be awesome, and then treated it with carelessness. And the monster, also another part of the story with good potential, only appeared when a killing was scheduled. I couldn't even dislike the monster, because, apart from the killings, it didn't do anything hateful, and his motivations never showed up.<br />I know I'll be thrashed by Koontz fans, but that's my opinion: this book could be much better.<br />Grade 6.0/10story with good potential, only appeared when a killing was scheduled.

As many other reviewers of this book, I also have read \\"The hot zone\\", and a plot that mixes bio-terrorism with biblical happenings - namely the Ten plagues of Egypt - will always interest me. So I bought this book.<br />The first thing that turned me off is on the cover: there are two authors. This usually doesn't work. When it comes to writing I can count in my fingers how many good books written in tandem there are. But maybe this one was an exception. No.<br />About the plot: very interesting, if somewhat unoriginal. A madman, clearly a sociopath, is re-creating - loosely re-creating, as I shortly noticed - Exodus' Ten plagues of Egypt in the US. To prevent him doing so, Jack Bryne, eminent virologist with a \\"shadowy\\" past, needs help from the FBI and his co-workers. The plot is interesting, and one of the authors is a M.D., so I supposed the medical / bio-warfare stuff is accurate. I really can't tell, but it seems so. OK. But the writing is awful. For 4/5 of the book there's no chase, no investigation, just a description of how the madman creates new bio-things to resemble the plagues. Then, in the last 50 pages, everything is suddenly, miraculously disclosed, and the final scenes are pitiful, C- or D- movie scripts stuff. Character development is nil. Jack Bryne and the rest of the good guys are completely stereothypical. The bad guy is a poor carbon-copy of Norman Bates. In the end, I was reading one paragraph out of five and still could understand what was going on.<br />I shouldn't have bought this book. This is nothing like Richard Preston. There is evidence everywhere that \\"The eleventh plague\\" will not elighten or even entertain its reader. The most revealing is in the back cover; there are paragraphs describing the backgrounds on the two co-authors. The M.D., John Marr, gets an extensive paragraph, about his researches, acomplishments and works. The other author, John Baldwin, a \\"free-lance writer\\" (?) gets two lines saying he lives in New England. Oh dear. That must mean something, and after finishing the book I saw I was right.<br />As I've said before, an interesting premise destroyed by terrible writing. Skip it.<br />Grade 4.2/10h dear.

King was in contant physical discomfort and suffering pains in his hip. He wanted to call this novel \\"Cancer\\" and it was his wife that convinced him on the contrary.<br />That is to say that King wrote \\"Dreamcatcher\\" while he was very angry, not only with the old man that run him over, but with life itself. And that shows in the beginning of the book. \\"Dreamcatcher\\" starts slowly, confused, purposelessly dark, and, first time with King's books - and I've read more than 20 of his books - with uninteresting characters. It seems SK  was writing this one to get rid of his psychological pain - King himself showed us many times that this kind of pain is much worse than physical pain. One of the main characters, Jonesy, has suffered an accident very similar to King's and his hip has been broken as well. There's nothing wrong with writing things from personal experience, but in this case his writing style was shadowed by personal emotions. When the military people enter the scene, the book gets even more confusing and dark.<br />But the second half of the book is the usual Stephen King, thank you very much. It's fast-paced, the characters get more real and interesting, and the story seems more solid. The four friends from the beginning are from Derry, and, to my delight there's a little connection with \\"IT\\", one of my favourite SK books. The ending is great. I felt, between the lines, that King was trying to apologyze to his constant readers for this unusual book, that he had to write this mostly for himself.<br />Two different halves: the first, a tale like \\"body-snatchers\\", strange aliens coming to a barren snow-filled landscape in Maine; the second, a breath-stopping chase and the mind-battle between an alien and a human.

His flowing, easy writing style grabbed me from page one, and along the book the cool plot and the above-average developed, human and likable characters did the rest of the job for me. His other books will be part of my reading list, no doubt.<br />The main character is Terry McCalleb, a retired FBI agent, now living in a boat anchored at a marina in LA. He's retired because his heart played a trick on him, and he had to wait two years at the organ-receiving line, almost loosing his life in the process. Finally, two months after a successful transplant, all he wants to do is fix his boat and drive to Catalina. But then, suddenly, a beautiful woman comes along and asks him to investigate the violent murder of her sister. McCalleb says he's off the game and won't do it, but then Graciela (that's the woman's name) says he should think about it, since the heart now in McCalleb's chest once belonged to her deceased sister.<br />From then on, the book goes from a seemingly simple situation to a very complex plot. It's interesting to see how Connelly makes McCalleb work, sometimes even to complete loose ends, just to a little bit later discover something he had previously missed. McCalleb is a coherent character, and the reader can't help but like him. Other characters are intersting as well, good ones and bad ones.<br />After reaching the end, I noticed that the solution is in plain sight in the middle of the book, if the reader pays enough attention or is interested in spoiling the fun for the end. I suggest not an investigative reading, but an enjoyable one. Just go along with McCalleb and it will be fine. Not the usual serial-killer-forensic-investigation thriller. Way above average.<br />Grade 9.1/10	2003-10-09

Mankell is a talented writer who praises his plots above everything, even above character development and book edition. Some pretty clear mistakes, like a totally wrong-placed first chapter and too many coincidences that help the main character, have to be forgiven so that the reader can fully enjoy \\"The white lioness\\".<br />Sweden and South Africa are linked by a white-supremacy conspiracy that intends to train in Scandinavia a black killer whose mission is to kill one of the two most important men in the african country: De Klerk and Mandela. The book is mainly divided between scenes in Sweden and South Africa. The ones in Sweden are a little too slow, and the reader has to pay full attention to remain interested in the story. The parts in South Africa are more interesting.<br />The main character, swedish inspector Kurt Wallander, is an anti-hero: low-profile, coward, has bad-relationship with his father and daughter. Yet, he's very likable. The reader unwillingly takes Wallander side on the story, even when he does everything wrong. That's his power. Many other characters are part of the plot, some of them more interesting than others. The ending is a little too rushed, and in my opinion could be more developed. This is a very straight and correct book. Mankell doesn't risk too much concerning his writing style.<br />I understand Mankell has already written several other books featuring Inspector Wallander, and \\"The white lioness\\" is only the second one. Also, Mankell was previously known for his children books and his theater plays. I'm pretty sure that his plots and characters show much improvement in more recent books, but nonetheless this one is a preety good way to get to know Henning Mankell.<br />Grade 8.0/10	2003-10-07

If all math teachers were like him - or at least the like the way he wrote \\"Fermat's enigma\\" - many more little kids would be interested in math.<br />Fermat's last theorem is, to math, what the holly Grail is to christians. To prove that a seemingly simple equation, x^n + y^n = z^n has no solution if n&gt;2. Before dying, Fermat wrote on the margins of a book: \\"I have reached an amazing demonstration, but there's not enough space in this page for me to paste it here!\\" This irritating, carelessly written note has been the nightmare of mathematicians for the last 350 years.<br />In this book, Singh tells how Andrew Wiles finally demonstrated that Fermat was right, but, more than that, Singht throws in a very concise but utterly interesting history of math, from Pytagoras to the newest techniques of the XXth century. Singh uses very little math-talk, and sometimes that made me feel there was something missing. I wanted to fully understand how Wiles broke up Fermat's enigma, but, of course, Singh is the wise one and I'm the dumb one, because very few people alive are able to completely understand this level of mathematics. Wiles' final report on the solution is 200 pages long and deals with much more than simple numbers.<br />This book is the best math lesson I've ever had, and I recommend it to everybody who wants to have a wider horizon on various subjects.<br />Grade 9.4/10	2003-09-29

Deaver seems to me an author that knows what he's talking about, creating good main characters and awesome plots. When I heard about \\"The blue nowhere\\", I had no trouble racing to the nearest bookstore to buy it.<br />The explanation is simple. I think that, like me, Deaver is used to using the world wide web, but he knew nothing about hacking, cracking, internet, programming and such. Just to try and understand all this \\"technological esoteric\\" stuff is something to praise. It's not easy to understand this kind of things beginning from scratch, as I'm sure Deaver has done, and I respect him for that.<br />\\"The blue nowhere\\" is a thriller with some uncommon elements. To begin with, there's an interaction between the physical and the virtual worlds, since the vilain, a cracker named Phate, is using his computer-programming abilities to get information about the people he wants to kill, in order to win a game called Access. To get to Access' expert level, Phate search people that are virtually inviolable, knows everything there is to know about them, and, using his skills as a \\"Social engineer\\", gets them to trust him and stabs them in the heart. The book's main character, however, is Wyatt Gillette, a hacker in the latus sensus of the word, but Gillette is doing time in prison because he supposedly hacked into the main program of the US Department of Defense. Gillette is controversialy summoned to help California's Computer Crime Unit, and then begins a cat-and-mouse race against time to prevent Phate to further killings.<br />Like his previous books, the pace is very fast, and the near-madness plot prevents the reader of complaining against a dubious character-development - even if in this one there are more memorable characters than in the Rhyme series. Also, there are many plot-twists; some of them I could see coming, but some others got me completely unware. In fact, Deaver is very good at that, and that's why I will keep buying his books.<br />There's a computer-glossary in \\"The blue nowhere\\" and that's what makes the difference between this book and some of the cyber-thrillers that abund in the books universe, where the author simply makes the assumption that the readers are acquainted with the unusual vocabulary.<br />Grade 8.9/10pletely unware.

And, at least in \\"The quiet game\\", the plot  is very good.<br />Penn Cage abandoned a successfull career as a death-row prosecutor to become a legal-thriller writer. Then, when his young wife dies because of cancer, he goes back to his childhood city, Natchez, Mississipi, to get help from his parents to raise his daughter. But, inadvertently, Cage steps in a wasp's nest when he mentions, in a conversation with a journalist friend, an unresolved racial crime that happened 30 years ago. Suddenly, the little town must take sides on the matter, and Penn finds himself standing in the thin line that is the middle of a war zone in Natchez.<br />This is just the main plot of \\"The quiet game\\". Iles throws lots of other balls in the air and seems to be toying with them, it's no effort for him not to let them fall. The text is good, there are lots of action scenes, the situations begin to be tied-up together and in the end, I was left with the impression of an excellent book. Penn Cage is not the only fully-developed character in the book. There are many of them, and the simple mentioning of their names brings to the reader instant recognition: they are all three-dimensional, some good, some wickedly bad, but all very present throughout the story.<br />Greg Iles was really raised in Natchez, and I wonder how much of the book was imagination and how much of it was the truth. Even the name of the main character has the same number of letters of the author.

I must say SK is able to control all kinds (and lenghts) of stories he wants to write, but after reading \\"Everything's eventual\\" I realized that, since character and plot development are SK's strong points, his short stories could be just the starting point to complete books. At least the ones in this book.<br />Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed most of them as much as I have enjoyed other SK books that have become my \\"enjoyable reading\\" milestones, like \\"The stand\\" and the \\"Dark Tower\\" series, among others. It's just that, spoiled constant reader that I am, I wanted more.<br />About the short stories in \\"Everything's eventual\\". The cover defines them as \\"14 dark tales\\". Couldn't be more right. Most of them deal with death, but in a subtle way, nothing explicit like \\"Salem's lot\\".

But they are not repetitive.

I don't even know what each one means. All I care is if it's good sci-fi or not. \\"The exiles trilogy\\", though not a masterpiece, is one very enjoyable story.<br />Ben Bova wrote the three parts of his trilogy between 1971 and 1975. The first part, \\"Exiled from Earth\\", set in the near future, tells about how the World government decides to cast away all the top-most genetic scientists and people working with them, least they un-balance the already precarious staquos quo of the overpopulated planet. This first part is the most action packed and has little science fiction in its lines, and is in fact the least likeable part of the trilogy. But what I noticed is that Bova's style is very similar to some of Asimov's stories, the ones featuring Lucky Starr, Elijah Bailey and Hari Seldon in the prequels to the \\"Foundation\\" series (books that I constantly re-read). Full of little plots that get together in the end, shallow but likeable characters, fast-paced reading.<br />The second and third parts, \\"Flight of the exiles\\" and \\"End of exile\\" are set aboard the sattelite/spaceship that becomes home to the exiles. These two parts have little or no connection between themselves or the first part of the trilogy, except for the fact of the earlier exile. They're darker, better written and the main plots are much more interesting. I won't say anything because I don't want to spoil the fun of reading them.<br />But my two comments on \\"The exiles trilogy\\" are: 1) Although the three parts were written in separate and were meant to be standalones, I think they must be read back-to-back. They'll be better enjoyed this way. 2) There are many things that happened between the three parts of the trilogy, but Bova hardly explains what happens. I was left with the feeling that I wanted something more, and I kept looking for it till the end, but those explanations never came. Maybe Bova could write new books about the Exiles. The story is very good and has potential for further development.<br />Grade 8.1/10could write new books about the Exiles.

I mean, you can read this book without an encyclopaedia by your side (unlike \\"Foucault's pendulum\\", for example), even if sometimes you wished there was a Britannica or at least an internet terminal close by so you could look up some interesting things depicted in the book.<br />Baudolino is an italian gentleman born in the XXII century. Early in life, he is adopted by Frederick Barbarossa, ruler of the Holy Roman-Germanic Empire. As his son, Baudolino is drawn to many important happenings, and claims he was sole responsible, through a series of interesting schemes, for some of the most important situations in the history of Europe.<br />Is Baudolino the grey figure behind Barbarossa's actions, or is he just a very immaginative liar? The answer is given by Eco in the final third of the book, where Baudolino and his friends get to know fantastical places and beings while looking for the fabled Christian Kingdom of Presbyter Johannes in the eastern unknown territories of Earth.<br />\\"Baudolino\\" may seem simple at first sight, but there are so many levels buried behind the improbable shallow layer of paper that the reader may be tempted to read it again only to disclose cool information and references, randomly (not too much randomly, in fact) pasted in the story by Eco. There're links to Swift's \\"Gulliver's travels\\", Marco Polo, Voltaire, and these are just the obvious ones. \\"Baudolino\\" is a blend of real history with fictional situations, but a blend that only Eco could create, and the reader is always wondering what is true and what is not. The story is so compelling that the reader may not notice that Baudolino himself is the only character fully developed. But who cares? This book is as fantastic as Baudolino's stories. There's even a misterious murder in it, like \\"The name of the rose\\".<br />One other thing. \\"Baudolino\\" has two narrators: one is Baudolino himself, telling the story of his life. The other narrator is a third-person, omniscient one, but sometimes (like he forgot to correct himself) he uses the \\"we\\" conjugation in his phrases, and the reader is left with the impression that this misterious narrator was in fact part of Baudolino's friends. Am I wrong? Did I understand it right? I don't know, but this is just something else about this book that I'll try to find out.<br />To fully understand \\"Baudolino\\", and as a matter of fact to fully understand Eco's universe, look for other information in the internet about him, especially the website \\"Porta Ludovica\\".<br />Grade 9.2/10story of his life.

Like Michener (most of his books, at least), Rutherfurd chooses one specific place (London, for example) and, through a series of characters inhabiting that place, he tells the story of a nation, or of a city. In this case, the \\"place\\" is the biggest country in the world: Russia, and her neighbours.<br />Like \\"Sarum\\", which tells the hisstory of England, \\"Russka\\" is the hisstory of Russia told from the point of view of three families, each occupying a different position in russian society. From the II century, through the tsarist empire and finally the October Revolution, Rutherfurd, in more than 900 pages, was able to provide his readers with the right blend between a well-created fiction with the most important parts of russian history. And yet, I thought this book was shorter than it could be.<br />Rutherfurd's style sometimes leave the reader tired. Some of his sentences are a little too prosaic for the kind of fiction he's intended to write. He abuses the right to use the word \\"For\\" (as in \\"For Nicolai was the greatest poet in Ukraine\\") to begin a phrase. One other problem I found was concerning the division of the book. The part I expected the most was the Revolution. I was satisfied when I read it. It's well written, interesting and holds the attention of the reader. In fact, the Revolution is the climax of russian history (at least in my opinion, I'm not russian and I really don't know that much about russian history), and the author does a good job in building the tension and creating a very \\"russian\\" atmosphere in the previous chapters before the revolution. But the problem is that, after 1917, the book ends. Nothing about the second World War, nothing about Breschnev, the Perestroika and the fall of the Berlin wall. So, I was left with the sense that there was somethig missing. Rutherfurd could have written at least 300 more pages and I wouldn't think this would a book too big, given its subject.<br />But I think that I was rewarded after closing the final page on \\"Russka\\". I wanted a book of fiction that would show me the history of Russia. Rutherfurd's research and his choice of characters, although conservative, were very good. \\"Russka\\" is entertaining and gripping, and I was hooked all through its 900 pages.<br />Grade 8.3/10k too big, given its subject. <br />But I think that I was rewarded after closing the final page on \\"Russka\\".

However, \\"It\\" is Stephhen King's  masterpiece about FEAR. During  the whole novel, the reader is stuck with an uneasy, creepy, dark feeling, and I would not be surprised if I knew that most of the readers left lights on after reading the book.<br />Some say \\"It\\" is much longer than it needed to be. I disagree. The first 800 pages are there for a reason, and that's to set the atmosphere and let the reader get acquainted with the main characteres and, mostly, with the city of Derry, Maine. Stephen King's writing about Derry was so graphic that I was able to draw a very good picture of it in my mind, and I think that's important to enjoy the story further. Derry itself is one of the main characters in \\"It\\".<br />About the human characters, \\"It\\" is divided in two parts: 1958 and 1985. In 58 we know that Derry is one spooky place to live, when kids start to be murdered in gruesome ways. Then we're introduced to Bill Denbrough and his stuttering and leadership, to Richie Tozier and his Voices, to Ben Henscomb and his fatness, to pretty Bev Marsh, Eddie, Stan and Mike. They're the members of the Loosers Club, a bunch of common kids that get together to be outstanding among themselves. But they're not common at all, because together they are able to identify and fight the dark evil power lurking at the bottom of their city. And in 85 they are together again in Derry, trying to finish It forever.<br />Of course, there's much more to \\"It\\" than that, but it's best to read the whole book. Once again, Stephen King's children characters are awesome. SK's capacity to develop characters, even the minor ones, is amazing. Also, his style is to write about lots of situations, that sometimes are seeminlgy out of context, only to be tied up with the rest of the story in a few pages. And then, the 1985 characters are perfectly coherent to what they were when they were kids.<br />Atmosphere. That's why \\"It\\" is 1100 pages long, not 400. The story grabs the reader and won't let go. The final chapters (200 pages) are completely frantic and hallucynated, especially both confrontations with It. And there are some strange things too. At least, in one specific situation, I think Stephen King was a little wrong there. The kids would have to be older for that specific situation to happen as he describes it. Those who already read it will know what I'm talking about. Those who haven't, read it and see if you agree with me.<br />Grade 9.2/10long, not 400. The story grabs the reader and won't let go.

US	52599570	R3LHXXOFI2CKG	0451207521	583024749	Jackdaws	Books	4	1	1	N	N	Back to World War II	Like some other bestselling authors (namely John Grisham and Tom Clancy), Follett's last books flopped in the critics' and customers' reviews. \\"The third twin\\", \\"Code to zero\\" and \\"Hammer of eden\\" were thrashed from left and from right, and in my opinion deservedly so. Follett is a talented author, but in these three books it seems he chose subjects that didn't appeal to the general public. Besides, his style of wrtiting was different from the successful one that made books like \\"Pillars of the Earth\\" and \\"Eye of the needle\\" become most wanted among legions of Follett's fans. It looked like the author himself lost interest in his books, and his fans didn't take it lightly.<br />These facts may be true, and the proof is that Follett wrote two thrillers in sequence, less than one year apart, going back to the subject and the atmosphere he knows best: World War II.  It seems his public liked the change. At least, the reviews are a lot kinder than before.<br />\\"Jackdaws\\" is the story of a group of women lead by secret agent Flick Clairet. Their mission is to parachute into occupied France, and blow-up a telephone exchange that will help provide the security the Allies need on D-day. OK. That's a good subject. The plot in \\"Jackdaws\\" is interesting and the pace is very fast. In fact, the very opening scene is a pistol shooting between the Gestapo and agents of the french Resistence. The chapters are all full of action, and Follett doesn't let the rhythm slow down. Yes, it seems he's back on track.<br />But there are some problems. I was left with the impression that, though the plot is interesting, it's somewhat thin, and Follett had to struggle hard to keep the reader's full-time attention. That's why there are so many cold-blooded murders, shootings, etc. One other problem is about the characters. Flick Clairet and the nazi torturer, Dieter Franck, are both cool (enemies at haeart), but also full of contradictions. Sometimes what they did and said was plainly wrong. And all other characters are shallow to the point of oblivion. Follett tried to spice things up: there's homosexualism, a transexual, one (almost hot) lesbian scene. But it didn't work out as well as he intended, because he concentrated to much of the book's focus on the two main characters.<br />I give \\"Jackdaws\\" 4 stars because, even if it's not Follett's best, it kept me up reading way after midnight. And also because Follett shows that he worries about his readers. It's like he's thinking: \\"OK, I tried to change subjects, but maybe I didn't do my homework so well. I'll go back to World War II, give my constant readers (as Stephen King would say) two good books on that subject, and then I'll do a better research on future stories that are not about WWII\\".

As happens with Machado de Assis, everybody who is interested in good literature should learn portuguese to read Eça de Queiroz in his original language. The author of \\"The Maias\\", \\"The crime of Father Amaro\\", \\"A cidade e as serras\\", among many others, is the most revered realism writer in portuguese literature, and this is no undeserved praise.<br />\\"The mandarin\\" is, literally, one fantastic tale. Like many other Queiroz's characters, Teodoro is a divided man, split between his simple, plain life as a public servant, and his dreams of greatness, success and fortune. Suddenly, during one lonely night, a fantastic character (maybe the demon ?) offers him a little bell. If Teodoro choses to ring this little bell, some rich Mandarin in the ends of China will die, leaving Teodoro all his money. Believing it a dream, Teodoro doesn't hesitate to ring the little bell, but in fact an incredible sum of money is brought to him, along with news that the far-away Mandarin has indeed died in China. After a while, consumed by regret and living a boring (although rich) life, Teodoro decides to go to China to try and fix his mistake.<br />Using his usual dry and intelligent sarcasm, Eça de Queiroz is able to create a complex tale and a complex character in less than 100 pages. In portuguese, his phrases and sentences flow so easily in the eyes (and ears, if you're reading it aloud - this is a good idea) of the reader that this story looks like a chant.<br />If you've never read Eça, this one is a short and good way to start. After that, move on to his more complex works. No regrets.<br />Grade 8.0/10	2003-07-31

Being written in 1957, and a product of an incipient Cold War, maybe it was science fiction back in the fifties, but now \\"On the beach\\" is more like \\"apocalyptic fiction\\".<br />The story is about what could have happened if the northern countries decided to strike nuclear attacks on each other in 1961. Two years later, the whole upper part of the globe has fallen under the radioative cloud, ant there's no one left.  Because of the wind patterns, this dooming cloud is slowly reaching southern countries like Brazil, Argentina, South Africa, Australia and New Zealand.<br />Dwight Towers is the commander of one of the two remaining submarines existent in the US Navy, now based on Melbourne. There, he meets Moira Davidson, a young alcoholic woman, and her two friends, Australian navy-man Peter Holmes and his wife, Mary, and they have to cope with, literally, the end of the world.<br />\\"On the beach\\" is not an action book, and it's not about heroic achievements to save what remains of Earth. This is a book of sorrow and regret. Nevil Shute's characters can be divided between those who have accepted their terrible fate, and those who will deny it until the end. That's what is most interesting, and most depressive too.<br />Not a long book, \\"On the beach\\" seems to drag on for the first three-quarters, only setting a gray but necessary background, but the final chapters are like the water running down the drain in an emptying sink: twisty, fast-paced and hypnotic. Yes, hypnotic is a good word. The reader will keep reading, trying himself to look for ways out, only to discover that sometimes reality is more powerful than imagination.<br />\\"On the beach\\" is sad all the way. In fact, the title alone is very depressive, once the reader understand its meaning, disclosed on a poem in the first page, and in the very last line. But it is also a powerful reading, one that will stick to the reader's mind after the book is finished.

Deservedly, his popular historical fiction books written between 1940 and 1960 are accurate, interesting, with good plots and well-developed characters. All of these books, in one level or another, deal with christianism and its relation with ancient people and cultures (The egyptian, the roman, etc). Since Waltari graduated in theology, that's nothing surprising. The secret of the kingdom is one of his later books, being some kind of apotheosis of his career.<br />The secret of the kingdom is told from Marcus' point of view. Marcus is a wealthy roman citizen, driven away to Alexandria because of a love relationship gone bad. In the egyptian city, he becomes involved with jewish culture and prophecies. Some unseen power, that Marcus can't understand, makes him go to Jerusalem (this is around 30 A.D.). When he gets closer to the sacred city, he witnesses the execution of three criminals by cruxification, but one of the condemned draws his attention: his name is Jesus. To understand the quiet power behind Jesus presence, Marcus starts to wander through Judea and Galilee, getting acquainted with Jesus' sermons, thoughts, and with people he knew and cured. Through these voyages and conversations, he wants to find his Path in life.<br />Waltari's book also has this quiet power that makes the reader think. His writing style is beautiful and closer to poetry than it shows to our eyes at first glance. This book is fully peopled with characters of the New Testament, although carefully centered in the ones with a minor degree of importance (that's one of its interesting features). Although a little too conservative, The secret of the kingdom is a very good fictional  portrait of Jesus' last days on Earth.<br />In the end, what is most important about The secret of the kingdom is Jesus' beautiful message.<br />Grade 8.8/10	2003-07-14

It's enough to say that \\"Snow crash\\" is about a near future that is very dark, yet brightly colored by Stephenson's good writing. Add to that a main character that is the greatest sword fighter in the world, a teenage girl who fears almost nothing, a gigantic aleut who carries an atomic bomb wherever he goes, a virtual reality universe called The Metaverse, an enormous conglomeration of boats drifting in the Pacific close to the californian coast, and an ancient sumerian cult that is capable to interact with the human brain in a most unusual way, and we have a sample of what is \\"Snow crash\\".<br />But there's more. Stephenson is able to write, in the same breath, sex, action, pursuits, sword fights, and technological stuff. What's best, when it's needed, Stephenson's didatics is great. He deals with some very misty subjects, and yet he is able to make the reader completely at ease. His characters are very unusual, greatly developed, colorful and interesting. Some of his ideas are so crazy that they may be hard to grasp at once. But when you understand the greater picture behind Stephenson's main ideas, \\"Snow crash\\" is a very entertaining book. My only complaint is about the ending. I expected a bit more in the final moments of the story.<br />If you have read \\"Cryptonomicon\\", there's no way to compare the Snow crash's plot with Cryptonomicon. Cryptonomicon is much more complex and lenghty. But Snow crash has the same allucinating pace, and Stephenson's characteristic style of writing. Which is, difficult but engrossing.<br />Grade 9.0/10	2003-07-10

People who have never read Arturo Perez Reverte will be deceived when told \\"Seville communion\\" is a plain \\"whodunnit\\" thriller. Reverte's books are muchh more than that. What he usually does is imagine an unusual situation (the plot), and unusual characters, and these characters will relate to each other with the unusual situation as background. This is how he works, and we can notice it in \\"The Dumas club\\", \\"The Flanders panel\\" and \\"The nautical chart\\".<br />\\"Seville communion\\" follows the same pattern. The unusual situation is that someone named Vespers has hacked into His Holiness The Pope's personal computer. There, vespers leaves a message about how a small but ancient church in Seville is killing people who want it destroyed. Yes, it's a bit strange, but Reverte knows how to manage the bizarre plots he conceives.<br />The main character is Father Lorenzo Quart, a member of a \\"black-ops\\" branch of the Catholic Church in Rome. More like a soldier than a priest, he travels to Seville to see what's really going on. In the Andaluzian city he will find many of those unusual characters, like an ambitious banker who wants the grounds the church lies on, his ex-wife, beautiful, powerful, with a little crush on men who wear black, her old, Coca-Cola addicted mother, four small-time crooks who can't do anything right, an old priest who will do anything to save his parish, and other interesting people.<br />Reverte's characters are developed almost to exhaustion (the author's exhaustion, not the reader's). His story flows very well. Reverte writes in a way that doesn't offend the reader with idiotic paragraphs and chapters, and sometimes he deliberately hides one thing or another from the reader, leaving him/her to think. All these elements together make you forget that \\"Seville communion\\" `s genre is supposedly a mistery thriller.

It grips the reader from the traumatic beginning to the shocking end. Donaldson, no doubt, took the principles stablished by Tolkien to write the Unbeliever series, but he added so many unique dark elements, situations and characters that, while reading \\"Lord Foul's bane\\" it more than often didn't remind of Lord of the Rings.<br />The first dark thing is that the main character, Thomas Covenant, is a leper. As it is, he proclaims himself an outcast, unclean, avoiding contact with other people and living in reclusion in his farm after being abandoned by his wife and little son. Yet, he refuses to accept his fate, and his mood towards life obviously isn't one of the better. Suddenly, summoned by forces he can't and won't understand, to The Land, his leprosy is cured and he is the carrier of an object (a white-gold ring) that is able to save the fate of The Land in the battle against Lord Foul the Despiser, even if he doesn't know how to use the magic contained in this object.<br />The Land is an agrarian landscape and many of its elements will remind the reader of Tolkien's Middle-earth. But the relations and backgrounds of the various kinds of people inhabiting The Land are so complex and well-thought that it in itself is one of the best things in the book. In fact, there's much more about The Land than Donaldson will reveal in this first book. I guess this was done to better relate the reader to Thomas Covenant. All the reader knows about The Land is what other characters tell Covenant. This is a smart move, because Covenant the Unbeliever is far from what we would call \\"a sympathetic character\\" (the expression anti-hero comes to mind, but in fact Covenant is no kind of hero at all).<br />Sour, bitter and angry are some of the adjectives that portrait Thomas Covenant. To keep his sanity he refuses to belileve his stay in The Land is more than a dream.

I'm ashamed to say, I bought it because, in a moment of futility, I thought the cover was cool. When I got home, I searched the web about Simon Lawrence, and what I got was pretty thin. For starters, Simon Lawrence doesn't exist. It's a pseudonym used by another author, the almost famous R.Karl Largent. \\"The pond\\" is Lawrence's one and only book. Largent is more prolific. At Amazon.com, you'll find at least 10 of Largent's books. All of them claiming, obviously, to be \\"#1 BESTSELLERS!!\\" and \\"THE TECHNO-THRILLER AUTHOR THAT OUT-CLANCYS CLANCY!\\". Well, anyway, hard to believe. And once you open the first page and start reading, it gets harder still. Largent, as far as I discovered, teaches writing in an university. In fact, his most popular books are something like \\"How to write and sell your novel\\", \\"Getting published - how the pros do it\\" and so on. His fiction books, although advertised as bestsellers, are not that much popular, at least regarding Amazon.com reviewers. Most of them have no reviews at all, and when they do, it's two or three at the most. And they are not very kind. After reading \\"The pond\\" I understand why.<br />First of all, I don't understand the reason for using a pseudonym here. Largent/Lawrence's style is so underdeveloped that using a pseudonym is unnecessary.<br />The cover says: \\"The pond - a novel of ecologic madness and unthinkable terror\\". Let's analyse those. Ecologic madness. The premise of the book is based on a small town in Alabama (or Louisiana); this town has a fertilizer plant, a Town Council and a reclusive old man and his deformed son, in whose property there's a stinking, misterious pond. There you go. These two lines describing the plot are enough to make the reader understand what the whole book is about. Nothing new here. Nothing ecological, and surely no madness.<br />Unthinkable terror. No way. What we have here, mostly towards the end, is a bunch of gore-filled scenes of chopped limbs and heads. I think the terror lies in the premise of the book, in the developmnet of the characters and Lawrence's style. The plot is thin and unwelcome, to say the least. I could see what the ending would be like from a mile away. The author couldn't decide on a main character, in fact he wasn't able to create at least one character that the reader would relate to. Lawrence's style is so academic and by-the-book that sometimes I thought I was reading non-fiction. The final lines are meant to be smart, but instead are completely ridiculous and hanging with no support. In fact, the whole book reads like the script of a bad \\"C\\" terror movie.<br />To sum it up, bad literature. Well, I read it through the end, at least.<br />Grade 3.5/10ed scenes of chopped limbs and heads.

In fact, Waltari is one of those authors that made historic fiction a popular genre of literature. His books (\\"The roman\\", \\"The etruscan\\", \\"Secret of the Kingdom\\", among others) are all based on great and accurate historic research and a central character, greatly developed and inserted in his background. One other thing that is repeated along his books is the presence, in different levels of transparency, of Christian elements (yes, even if it's ancient Egypt, as in this case).<br />The egyptian of the title is Sinuhe, an orphan raised by an elder couple. Sinuhe's adopted father is a physician on a poor neighboorhod in Thebes, Egypt's capital at the time (circa 1300 b.C.). Sinuhe chooses the profession of his father, but the difference is that he becomes the Pharao's physician, immersed in the court's game of deception, rivalries and connections. Sinuhe's time is the time of Pharao Amenhotep IV, who tried to change egyptian religion from polytheism to monotheism. The cult of Aton - the only god - was not well accepted by the religious class nor by the population, and the self-renamed Akhenaton (former Amenhotep) was one of the most hated rulers of all times.<br />Sinuhe is a believable and complete character, although developed in an old-fashioned way. In fact, the whole book, its writing style and its characters have an old aura about them. Some of the situations and dialogues are extreme, and sometimes don't ring true, but those are rare occasions. Sinuhe and his faithful servant Kaptah travel through Egypt, Syria, Crete and back to Egypt, collecting information, meeting kings, girls and enemies. Sinuhe's life is full of things happening all the time. Waltari tells Sinuhe's envolvent story through the book. He was able to blend true facts with fiction in an excellent way, stablishing himself as one of the \\"fathers\\" of historic fiction.<br />If you've never read Mika Waltari, \\"The egyptian\\" is a great way to begin.<br />Grade 9/10athers\\" of historic fiction. <br />If you've never read Mika Waltari, \\"The egyptian\\" is a great way to begin.<br />Grade 9/10	2003-06-18

Most of those reviews are well intentioned and express the reviewers' true impressions of the item they want to talk about. That said, let's analyse the reviews about \\"Lonesome Dove\\". At the present date, there are 234 reviews about this book. There are only 3 1-star reviews, 3 2-stars reviews and 2 3-stars reviews. All others are 4- or 5-stars reviews. So many people can't be wrong, and they are not.<br />\\"Lonesome Dove\\" is impressive in size, story, style, characters and many other aspects. It won the coveted Pulitzer Prize in 1986, putting McMurtry's name along with others like Saul Bellow, Toni Morrison, Philip Roth, etc.<br />The story is seemingly simple enough. The two main characters, Augustus McRae and Woodrow Call, are in charge of the Hat Creek outfit, based on small Lonesome Dove, Texas. The outfit makes commerce on cattle, horses and such. Then, unexpectedly, comes to town Jake Spoon, old Rangers-mate of McRae and Call. Jake talks of Montana, a quiet yet beautiful country on the border of Canada, heaven on Earth, and Call decides to start a cattle and horses ranch up north. The story tells how Call and McRae drive thousands of heads of cattle and horses through the 3000-mile trek. But there's more to \\"Lonesome Dove\\" than that.<br />The western background is perfect for the desolate mood set in the book. I've heard many people say that it's almost 200 pages before anything happens in the story. Not true. The first 200 pages are greatly used to introduce almost every major character in the book to the reader. And all characters are extremely well-developed. McMurtry took his time and used his brain to create real people with deep detail. Before long, the reader knows who is who, their motivations, reasons and beliefs. Aside from the \\"drive to Montana\\" plot, there are many other sub-plots that will eventualy be related to each other, and these sub-plots make the reader take his time and think about what just happened in the last chapters. The only thing that annoyed me some was the fact that in a place so big and vast, people kept bumping in each other all the time, but that's understandable for fictional purposes.<br />One other thing caught my attention. McMurtry writes what has to be written, not concerned with what is now conventioned politically correct, being true to what he thought his characters should say and do. Even if it's more than 900-pages long, \\"Lonesome Dove\\" will be a fast reading because while you're at it, you'll easily imagine the landscapes, the people, the towns, the women. McMurtry is that good.<br />In short, a wonderful book, worth reading, that will transport the hardest reader to another time and place.<br />Grade 9.5/10sub-plots make the reader take his time and think about what just happened in the last chapters.

However, both books have european (british) characters in the main role, and both books are based on the differences and struggling of these characters in a different environement.<br />Dirk Struan is the Tai-pan (supreme ruler) of the Noble House Trading Company, one of the Hong Kong-based companies that provide England and Europe with the middle-1800s wonder: tea. Along the book, Struan has to overcome rival companies, murder threats, malaria, love interests and the supposedly dettachment of Britain towards having an Asian base on Hong Kong.<br />Like \\"Shogun\\", \\"Tai-pan\\" has dozens of plot twists, many characters all involved with each other in one level or another, forces of nature, etc. Unlike \\"Shogun\\", \\"Tai-pan\\" has a very fast pace and the chapters follow one another with the speed of a Typhoon. In the beggining, the reader will struggle with the speed Clavell introduces his characters, and there will be at least 100 pages until you know who is who, but past that phase, \\"Tai-pan\\" is very enjoyable.<br />Dirk Struan, the main character, sure seems a little super-human sometimes, but that's not something that will spoil the reading.

US	52599570	R34G8EGNEA6IFO	0425115801	134454761	Lightning	Books	5	2	2	N	N	First Koontz experience	This is the first book by Dean Koontz that I've read. While it's plain Koontz is not the most talented writer in the world, he knows (at least in this book) how to create a thrilling atmosphere, using ideas from different sets of backgrounds. In \\"Lightning\\" we have a thriller mixed with sci-fi and politics.<br />Laura Shane is the main character of the story. Her life is constantly in danger from the moment of her birth; on all dangerous occasions, a misterious guardian appears out of the blue, followed by intense lightning and sounds of thunder, and manages to save her life. This is just an initial outline of the story, but it was this little outline that got me hooked and made me buy the book. Its first half is about Laura's life, until she's over thirty years-old. In the middle of the book, we are told who the guardian really is, and where he comes from. From then on, \\"Lightning\\" becomes a pursuit thriller, and that's when we see Koontz's ability to deliver a fast-paced tale. One of the editorial reviews say that once the \\"mistery\\" is revealed, the narrative runs out of ideas. I don't think so. In fact, I thought the second half of the book was much better than the first.<br />As many reviewers have stated, the characters in this book are not that well developed, and some of them are really annoying. The lines of Laura's seven-year-old son, for example, are completely absurd for someone that young, and some of the dialogue is too far-fetched. Otherwise, if you don't pay attention to that kind of detail, and if you like fast page-turners, I think there's no way not to like \\"Lightning\\". It will not stik to your mind long after you turn the last page, but while you're reading it you'll enjoy.<br />Grade 8.6/10	2003-05-27

Cherry-Garrard wrote &quot;The worst journey in the world&quot; after the first world war, ten years after he returned from Antarctica, so he took his time to write a book based on reason and not based on the recent emotions he lived while on the frozen continent.<br />We have to remember that this book is almost 100 years old, so the text sometimes reads like something from Jules Verne... only it's true. His experience in loco aside, Garrard uses many passages from the crew's personal diaries (everybody had a diary going on) to better illustrate what happened on the expedition.<br />The book starts very slow, with more than a hundred pages of logistics, arrangements and such. What makes this part interesting is Garrard's personal views of other members of the expedition. But thes first 100 pages will prove difficult for the reader who only wants to know what happened to Scott and his four partners in the South Pole Expedition.<br />&quot;Worst journey&quot; really comes to life in Chapter 5, when the author starts to describe and explain all the expeditions and processes that would make possible Scott's going all the way south. I, for one, didn't think the whole thing was so complex. The final chapters, when Garrard narrates what really happened to Scott's party, and how the rescue team discovered their tent only 11 miles from salvation, are touching, and kept me reading way after bedtime.<br />Of course, as most of others reviewers stated, Cherry-Garrard's style is dry and his narration is partial, after all he personaly knew the people he was writing about, and he writes about things that really happened (that's why he says only a few words about Amundsen's expedition). &quot;The worst journey in the world&quot; is mandatory reading for everybody interested about South Pole exploration, no doubt about that. It's interesting to notice that, while Amundsen was the first to reach the pole, Scott, because of his tragedy, is more known to the general public. I would also recommend Roland Huntford's &quot;Last place on Earth&quot;, a very good analysis of the differences between Scott's expedition and Amundsen's - Amundsen reached the pole 34 days before Scott and return alive and well<br />Grade 9.0/10ody interested about South Pole exploration, no doubt about that.

Of all of them, only the last two have not let me down recently.<br />Nelson DeMille is not a new writer. His books have been around for the past twenty years, if not more. In my opinion, DeMille has achieved what every writer wants along his career: a consistent, improved, better writing style. Its very plain the difference between an early book like Cathedral and Lions game. While both have good stories and characters, the latter is more enjoyable, much more.<br />The lions game is the story of Asad Khalil, a lybian seeking, in USA, revenge for the killing of his family. John Corey, the same NYPD macho crude character from Plum island, is back, now working in a joint team with FBI, and hes in charge of capturing Khalil before the vengeance is completed. Corey is one of the best characters Ive met. Realistic, funny, well developed, believable. The mass market paperback version is almost 950 pages long, and its in fact a very fast reading. The story is compeling, well-written and well-researched.<br />DeMille divided the book in two parts. John Corey narrates some chapters in first person, in his usual way. Jokes every ten pages, sexist remarks, etc. Other chapters are told in Asad Khalils point of view, and these are interesting chapters, because DeMille was able to understand how a non-american thinks about american way of life. Khalil is a powerful character; DeMille didnt create only one more bad guy. Khalil is a complete character in the book.<br />Of course, the book has some implausible moments, and towards the end it gets a little unconvincing, but as a work of fiction its excellent. Now Im looking forward to reading Up country, and then DeMilles next book, which will feature John Corey once more.<br />Grade 9.2/10ll feature John Corey once more. <br />Grade 9.2/10	2003-05-07

There are two kinds of people: the ones who love Clive Cussler and his books and the ones who despise him and his books. After reading The mediterranean caper, Inca gold and Raise the Titanic, I was struggling not to be part of the second group. After reading Atlantis found, Im more convinced to be part of the second.<br />These four books made me understand the following: A) Clive Cusslers characters have enormous potential to be unforgettable. B) His plots, though mainly implausible, can be cool. C) Cussler doesnt know how to write. D) Cussler is becoming megalomaniac, like, say, Tom Clancy.<br />The mediterranean caper is one of Cusslers first books. In it, the set is confined, the plot is OK, Dirk Pitt and Al Giordino are amusing and even interesting characters, sort of (clich&eacute; coming) a blend of James Bond with Indiana Jones. Thats OK. People like their heros to be undestructible, women falling all over them, etc. I supposed Cussler, along the years, would improve his writing style, develop more his characters and plots. Inca gold was clearly an improvement compared to The mediterranean caper and Raise the Titanic. But Atlantis found is something else.<br />Dirk Pitt and Giordino are still immortal, superior human beings. All other characters, no exception, in Atlantis found, are sadly poor. The plot and its premises are laughable. Neo-nazis responsible for a great world-wide catastrophe in order to rule the world is nothing new. The beginning of the book is good and gets the reader hooked, but after a hundred pages everything falls apart. In fact, some passages of the book were interesting, but this only made the worst parts of the book more visible. In the end, I just wanted the book to finish fast.<br />Still, I would give Atlantis found three stars, but two things made it drop to two:<br />1) Cusslers mania in giving every object its complete specifications, characteristics, etc. Example:<br />This is the new german Glock Super .358 Caliber Two Chambers Silver Reloadable Master I just got.<br />Or Id like a bottle of Chateau Perriere Sauvignon Dandini Zidane Alain Prost Cabernet 76 please. If you have one of them, of course.<br />2) Cussler in fact is a character in his own book! This is ridiculous!<br />To sum it up, in my opinion, Dirk Pitt is a great character in the hands of a bad writer.<br />Grade 4.5/10s, etc. Example:<BR>This is the new german Glock Super .358 Caliber Two Chambers Silver Reloadable Master I just got.<BR>Or Id like a bottle of Chateau Perriere Sauvignon Dandini Zidane Alain Prost Cabernet 76 please.

There, she finds a whole new world, a whole new scot clan, political intrigues, and a new love, named Jamie Fraser. The problem is, she was married in the XXth century. What is worse, Jamie Fraser is hiding from the red-coats englishmen because of a capital felony. What's even worse, one of the english officials, named Jack Randall, is completely (and strangely) maniac about putting his hands on Fraser, and this very same Jack Randall is Claire's XXth century husband's great-great-great-great-whatever-grandfather.<br />The plot seems complicated, no? Well, in fact it is a little bit, but Diana Gabaldon uses well the 800-plus pages of her first book in the Outlander series to develop and explain not only the plot but the characters on the book (and there are dozens of characters). \\"Outlander\\" surprised me not only because it's a better book than I expected, but because it's full of action, full of real and also fantastic situations, full of sex scenes (described with good taste, even if there are some hot sex scenes). More than that, Diana Gabaldon was able to create and develop at least fifteen complete characters, with background, motivations and credible reasoning. Also, the story is completely immersed in the political background of the English-Scottish relationship in the XVIIIth century, giving more realism to the plot.<br />But there were a couple of things that didn't go well with me. The first thing is: even if there are lots of dangerous situations and plot twists along the book, I thought they were all pretty much the same, only disguised here and there a little bit. The second thing is: even though I knew \\"Outlander\\" was the first book in a series, I thought it was going to be a complete book, and it is not. Towards the end (the last 100/150 pages), the story gets slower, and in the end, there are lots of things left without answer. I know, these will be properly answered in the next books, but I wanted them answered now, and I couldn't help feeling a little cheated. Well, I was going to buy \\"Dragongly in amber\\" anyway.<br />To sum it up, the \\"Outlander\\" series, from what I felt about the first book, may be one of the most interesting and well-written that I've read. It's got all the necessary elements: good characters, a good plot, and a good writer.<br />Grade 9.2/10ill be properly answered in the next books, but I wanted them answered now, and I couldn't help feeling a little cheated.

Even so, I had never read one of Ian Fleming's books, prejudicialy dismissing them as childish and poorly written. After ten years, I found &quot;Doctor No&quot; in a used-books store, and since I made the mistake of thinking this was, like in the movies, the first book of the series, I bought it.<br />In &quot;Doctor No&quot;, James Bond, after a bad mission and spending some time in a hospital, is given a kind of &quot;vacation mission&quot; in Jamaica. He has to discover what happened to the local stationed british secret agent, who is reported missing. When Bond gets there, he is driven towards Crab Key, a misterious island owned by Julius No, a tall, bald maniac for privacy and who is hiding things from jamaican administration.<br />To my surprise (and showing I was wrong in my prejudices), Fleming is a good writer who can hold the reader's attention at most times. It's just a pity that I didn't begin the series with the first book, &quot;Casino Royale&quot;, to see how Fleming developed his writing style, characters and plots while writing the books.<br />Other surprise was to compare Bond in the books with Bond in the movies. Bond in the books was more human and credible, even to the point of throwing up after moments of extreme tension. Other characters are interesting as well, like nature girl Honey Rider and Bond's friend Quarrell. I also liked to meet again characters like M and Q. Doctor No, though, as everything related to Crab Key island, is a little too fantastic for my taste, but, from the information I gathered, &quot;Doctor No&quot; is Fleming's most &quot;exotic&quot; and implausible book.<br />The important considerations are that Fleming can create good thrilling scenes, and that James Bond is a better character than I expected. I will surely look for &quot;Casino Royale&quot; and start the series in proper order.<br />Grade 8.8/10e series in proper order. <br />Grade 8.8/10	2003-04-14

The three authors have now achieved the consistency and class their book deserved.<br />In this second part, the spanish conquistadores are now a part of the Inca empire's life: there's no way to pretend they're not there, and after the death of Atahualpa it's the spanish that now rule de facto. However, the spanish Governador, Pizarro, must be an almost perfect politician, because he has to rule over the increasing fight for gold and power among the spanish officials and he must not let the remaining of the inca army to uprise again. Meanwhile, Gabriel and Anamaya, the main characters and love-duo of the first book, even in a crazed lust for each other, are not able to be together that often: Anamaya is the wife of the revered statue that represents all incas' ancestors, and Gabriel is spanish, which means that all incas see him as ruthless, evil and whose only interest in their lands is gold and raping women (not a beautiful vision).<br />The style remains the same: narrated in first person, the story seems to flow smoothly and continuously. But the plot is better, more exciting and interesting. The characters, though, at some times seem formulaic: the spanish are bad people, the incas are naïve, the inca princess falls in love with the only spaniard that stands for the inca people.

Being a fan of historical fiction, and because the main subject of the book interested me, I bought it. When I got home, I browsed the net and found out Ernest Gann had been a very prolific writer and adventurer until his death in 1991. Apart from being a writer, he had been an aviator, a sailsman and an artist, and had accomplished many things in his life. Most of his books deal with aviation and non-fiction, and many of them have been transformed into movies, like \\"Soldier of fortune\\" and \\"Fate is the hunter\\".<br />\\"Masada\\" is one of Gann's fiction books. In Judea, 70DC, the only piece of land the romans have not conquered is the table-like rock-formation called Masada. In it, for the past three years a group of a thousand-odd rebellious jews have refused to become roman slaves and defy the mighty army of Emperor Vespasianus.<br />Based on true events, the book narrates the last few days of the rebellion, when the roman army only awaits the last moments of building a huge, incredible ramp that will lead them to the gates of the jewish stronghold. \\"Masada\\" concentrates on three main characters: Silva, the roman general in charge of the local army, Eleazar, the jewish rebellious leader, and Sheba, the jewess who is Silva's lover.<br />Silva, an ugly, limping man, has been in the desert for three years and his only thoughts concern placating Emperor Vespasian's urgent requests that he delivers Roman Judea from the shame of having a piece of unconquered land. He has to deal with whispered commentaries within his own army concerning his competence, his love for the wine and, worst of all, his love for an outcast woman. Eleazar is the strong jew leader, thorn between despair of having not much else to do to hold the romans back and the shame of not being able to know certainly what to do. And Sheba is the jewess divided between the struggle of her own people and her love for the hated roman general Silva.<br />Gann's book is not long (315 pages), and the chapters are fast-paced, even if Gann always and at lenght displays what his characters are thinking. Silva, Eleazar and Sheba are very well developed and credible as characters. The outcome of the book is  great. \\"Masada\\" was a good surprise for me and should be for all those who like good historical fiction.<br />Grade 8.6/10neral Silva. <br />Gann's book is not long (315 pages), and the chapters are fast-paced, even if Gann always and at lenght displays what his characters are thinking.

His later books are still based on actual facts of new scientifical development, but books like &quot;The Andromeda strain&quot; and &quot;Eaters of the dead&quot; read more like documentaries with Crichton's intelligents insights. &quot;The great train robbery&quot; is one of those earlier books.<br />With an accurate portrait of the victorian society in the half of the 19th century, Crichton tells the story of Edward Pierce and Robert Agar, the main duo of the band responsible for the robbery of the train that carried the gold destined to support the Crimean war. From the inicial plan, until the accomplished fact, in a relatively short book, Crichton was able to give the characters the dimension of the real people they were. This book is more entertaining given the fact that it is a true story, so there are no impossible plot twists, improbable situations and factual mistakes. Crichton did a good research and provided his readers with a nice book.<br />In a time when bestselling authors such as John Grisham, Ken Follett and even Michael Crichton appear to be suffering from an inspirational crisis, it's a good idea to get their earlier books and read them at the top of their career. &quot;The great train robbery&quot; is one of these interesting books.<br />Grade 8.9/10	2003-03-25

Reaching the prison camp in South America, he didn't stop for one moment to try inumerous and different ways to escape and have back the normal life of an honest man. In the book, Papillon tells us how were the years in prison, the friendship with other inmates, the terrible and inhuman confinement in a prison cell he had to take alone for two years as a punishment while in prison, the evasions and what he did in the brief time he was a free man in Colombia.<br />All the while, Charriere kept the word that all that was in the book really happened to him during his years in prison in South America. I tried to believe that for most of the book, but there were some things that made me believe that, while the essence of  his very hard times is told in the book, the narrative was transformed to provide the readers a more compelling story. As an example, the constant division of the characters in the book: those who were totally friendly and loyal to Papillon, and those who only wanted him to suffer.<br />But what is important in &quot;Papillon&quot; is Charriere's strenght and his extreme denial in accepting his terrible fate, always trying to make his life and his friends' a little better in the situation they were. Aside from that, it's important to notice that the &quot;correction facilities&quot; and inmates situation maybe haven't changed that much since the 1930s and 1940s. I'm not defending people who were convicted from crimes they have commited, all I'm saying is that the legal system must have a commitment to the people they convict.<br />Grade 9.0/10	2003-03-14

Delaney. Delaney has to stop a serial killer who appearently has no motive to kill, and whose victims bear no relation whatsoever one to each other. What is worst, at first there are no clues about the murderer. Paciently, beginning with bits and tiny pieces of evidence, Delaney has to find the killer before he strikes again.<br />This is my first Sanders book. I found it a thriller totally different from what I were used to read. Sanders' writing style is (was) unique. He doesn't rush, he's not eager to go to the end of the book. Sanders is good with descriptions (something unusual to writers of this genre of books). He describes his characters at lenght, not only physically but also psychologically (and there are many characters in this book). For example, the first 100 pages of the book are only background to Captain Delaney's and Daniel Blank's (Blank is anoher important character) lives.<br />I would say that Sanders' style is the complete opposite of another author I like, James Patterson. While Patterson's chapters are very brief and his thrillers are fast-paced, Sanders like to completely develop his book, giving the impression his story is always under his total control. Captain Delaney is \\"The Cop\\", with capitals. He lives for his job and the job is his life. Sanders' way to make Delaney more human and less machine was to give Delaney a problem in the family (read the book and you will understand).<br />Anyway, do like Captain Delaney, take your time and read the series.<br />Grade 8.7/10	2003-03-14

Once again, Lincoln and his team of criminalists are trying to stop a killer. This time, the killer is the rental hitman with the same name of the title of the book, whose job is to kill three witnesses in a federal case.<br />As in the previous book in the series, Deaver is able to write a fast-paced and engaging thriller. I like to think Rhyme is sort of a modern Sherlock Holmes, using every bit and tiny piece of evidence, helped by state of the art, ultimate technology parafernalia to stay every time one step ahead of the killer.<br />Lincoln Rhyme is an almost flawless genious. Deaver's way to bring his character down to earth is to have made him a quadriplegic. This disability and his strong genious make Rhyme un unforgettable character for the readers who like good thrillers. Also, Deaver likes to get in the psychological side of his characters. Everybody in the book is tormented by some factor or other in his/her past life, and they have to deal with that during the story.<br />Like \\"The bone collector\\", this second book is full of plot twists and sudden happenings, some more plausible than others. Also like its predecessor, \\"The coffin dancer\\" has an ending that didn't leave me pleased, it seemed too unbelievable and without reason to be. But, aside from that, this book states that Jeff Deaver is one of the top thriller/forensic writers of today.<br />(Another thing that caught my attention is that the author puts a lot of initials in the story, but he always gives their meaning in the following paragraph, showing he wants the reader to understand what he's writing about).<br />Grade 8.7/10	2003-03-11

Everybody talked so much about this book, saying it was excellent, intelligent, funny, etc; the movie was very good; most reviews at Amazon.com praised it as being an instant modern classic of the 90s. Well, I guess I was expecting too much, and, in the end, I was a bit let down.<br />In \\"High fidelity\\", Rob Fleming is author Nick Hornby's alter ego. Rob is in his mid-thirties; his friends, his girl-friends, a promising carrer, everything got stuck in his past. Now he's the owner of Championship Vinyl, a store that sells old albuns and records for rock-afficcionados, and his store is not doing so well. And, to top it all, his present girlfriend, Laura, has just left him for another man, older, hairier and who wears leather pants.<br />To face this separation, Rob starts to analyse what went wrong in his life. His mania is to make \\"Top 5 lists\\" of everything, and he tells the story in the book by reviewing the \\"Top 5 toughest break-ups in my life\\". Along with that, he reviews his relationship with his parents, with the only two co-workers at the store, and with an american folk-singer trying to make a career in London.<br />Nick Hornby writes freely, I felt his narration almost like a speech put into words, and that's nice. But Hornby created Rob as a too much bitter person, and sometimes I got tired of his winning and complaining about everything; that's why I didn't give \\"High fidelity\\" 5 stars.<br />What I think is good is that Hornby didn't attempt to analyse male life in the 90s too deeply (that was not the book's proposal, anyway). Hornby just exteriorized his own feelings and transformed them in this book.<br />Grade 8.1/10	2003-02-25

Since Churchill was the 1st minister of the United Kingdom during most of the Second World War, it's natural for them to think CHurchill won the Nobel Peace Prize for achievements during the war. That's not the truth. Churchill won the Nobel Prize for LITERATURE in 1953, accordingly to the Scandinavian institution, &quot;for his mastery of historical and biographical description as well as for brilliant oratory in defending exalted human values&quot;.<br />Among the books that granted Churchill the Nobel Prize is &quot;The second world war&quot;. This book is a history lesson about WWII. Even if it's more than 1000 pages in length, it's never a tedious reading, even if it becomes very dense at some parts.<br />Churchill was always in the center of the war, as a politician. &quot;The second world war&quot; is a book about the War's politics. All the motives and reasons behind the war are toroughly explained, as well as all the war's developments during the toughest six years in the history of humanity.<br />Being a book mostly about politics, I felt at some times the lack of battle field scenes; being a book mostly about the war in Europe and northern Africa, I felt I wanted more information about the war in the Pacific. But it's undertandable that &quot;The second world war&quot; doesn't go very deep in these subjects, because Churchill writes mostly about what he was part of, so much so that in Brazil the title of this book is &quot;Memoirs of the second world war&quot;. And that's what it is: Churchill's memories of what he was part of during WWII.<br />So, it's not a complete book about the war, and it couldn't possibly be, but it's a fundamental book for readers to understand the war in a political way. For a complete understanding of other aspects of the war, there are other books that should also be read, like Cornelius Ryan's &quot;The longest day&quot;, &quot;A bridge too far&quot;, or Stephen Ambrose's books, just to name a few of the most popular.<br />Now I'm looking forward to reading Churchill's books on the First World war.<br />Grade 9.1/10Stephen Ambrose's books, just to name a few of the most popular. <br />Now I'm looking forward to reading Churchill's books on the First World war.<br />Grade 9.1/10	2003-02-24

Like Gore Vidal, in the year 1976 (or slightly before) other authors were invited to write a text or a book whose subject had to be related to that date (1776). For example, Isaac Asimov wrote \\"The bicentennial man\\" for the series.<br />\\"1876\\" brings back character Charles Schuyler, who had previously appeared in \\"Burr\\". After a self-exile of forty years, Schuyler is back to his native country and begins to write his impressions for New York newspapers. 1876 is election year in USA. It is also the final year of the Grant 8-year administration, which is notorious for its corruption and scandals related to large amounts of money.<br />Schuyler describes the race for the seat in the Oval office and his struggles to earn money in a country totally defferent from the one he left behind almost half a century before.<br />After the ridiculous voting and election problems during the Bush-Gore dispute, the reader can see that, after 125+ years, some things (specially related to power and money) are difficult to get changed, no matter where.<br />\\"1876\\" is about a nebulous (at least for me) period of the US history and, as always, Vidal, with his sarcasm, good prose and refined research, delivers another accurately historic fiction. The problem is, Vidal doesn't have complete respect for things he doesn't fully understand or know, so some passages of the book feature a bad taste that I don't like.<br />This book is not so dense and enjoyable as some of Vidal's other works, like \\"Lincoln\\" or \\"Creation\\" or Burr, but still one is able to learn about the period, society, people, etc featured in the story.<br />As part of the trilogy \\"Burr\\", \\"1876\\", \\"Washington D.C.\\", a necessary read for Vidal fans.<br />Grade 8.6/10	2003-02-10

Being an architecture sudent, it's only natural that I have a great interest in history of art and its greatest expoents.<br />Of course, everybody knows (I think) that Michelangelo was a master of all arts, not only painting, but also (and mainly) sculpture, not to mention poetry, architecture and civil engineering. There are lots of books with Michelangelo as main subject, but rarely these books are fictional. I like books of fiction concerning real historic events or people. When I found out about \\"Agony and ecstasy\\", and read the reviews at Amazon.com stating it was a great book, I raced to buy this book.<br />I read in one of the reviews that Irving Stone does with people what Michener does with places. It's entirely true. With the difference that, when the main subject is a person, the author can develop the character as long as he wants, and Stone does that wonderfuly, with a depth that you don't find in every book.<br />\\"Agony and ecstasy\\" is as turbulent and emotional as Michelangelo. Through its pages, the reader goes from the early years of the artist, his struggles to receive money and acknowledgment for his works, the passion he had for art in general and sculpture in particular.<br />Michelangelo is one of the greatest men that ever lived. Stone narrates his life with the help of each work he has conceived, from the comissions he got, through the effort to create subjects with different yet meaningful purposes. What is best, in this book Irving Stone has re-created not only Michelangelo's life, but also the political and religious environment of Europe and, particularly Italy. Besides Michelangelo, some other characters in \\"Agony and ecstasy\\" are: Leonardo da Vinci, Raphael, the architect Bramante, the painters Giotto, Tiziano, the popes Julius II (among many other popes), Lorenzo di Medici, and many other historic characters.<br />We can see that the author is concerned in creating an authentic and correct work, because after the conclusion of the story, there's a bibliography concerning not only Michelangelo, but also many books about Europe, Italy, Florene and Rome in the XVI century, history of the popes, and many others.<br />This is a great book for everybody interested in serious subjects, specially for those who like historical and artistical ones.

For those who doesn't know what this is, Palmer does with doctors what Grisham does with lawyers. The problem is, in my opinion, hospitals and doctors lack the plot-oportunities that we can easily find in the legal profession. So, in the end, everything seems very improbable, and the reader gets a feeling something is missing.<br />\\"Silent treatment\\" is about Dr. Korbet, a general practicioner (if I understood right, \\"gp\\"s are low in the \\"scale of doctors\\") whose wife is suddenly murdered during pre-op procedures. Korbet's life begins to go down the drain when he's accused of the murder and has no way to prove his innocence. On the other hand, a bunch of hot-shots of the medical-insurance industry are making reunions to, in a most unorthodox way, receive more money from their contributors. Obviously, the two plots are linked in some way or another.<br />This is not \\"the ultimate thriller\\", but is a light enterteinment, and an easy reading. There are many flaws, the most obvious being the very shall development of characters. The \\"bad guy\\" had a very good premise, but went underdeveloped as well, unfortunately.<br />If you are a Michael Palmer fan, read this one.

There is a big number of authors who, having made the smallest research about some point or other in history, give birth to terrible books advertised as \\"historic fiction\\", whereas \\"historic\\" is some tiny background barely mentioned in the plot, and the \\"fiction\\" is the worst possible.<br />I must admit I had this feeling about the Inca trilogy, but since there is very few fiction books concerning the Inca people, and I enjoy reading about pre-Colombian people, and (best of all) I received this one as a gift, I fave it a try.<br />About the author: in fact there are three authors (Antoine B. Daniel is a kind of compilation of their names); one of them is a history scholar, the other one is a awarded fiction writer, etc, and the story behind the book is that they gathered to write about the Incas like Jennings wrote about the Aztecs.<br />\\"The puma's shadow\\" (in Brazil, like in France, the title is \\"Princess of the sun\\") is the first part of the trilogy. In this first volume, we get to know the Inca empire shortly before the arrival of the spanish: the struggle for power between Huascar and Atahualpa, based on the visions of the female main character of the book: the strange, blue-eyed Anamaya. On the other side, in Spain, we are acquainted with Don Gabriel, a deserted young man, who seeks fortune in the new lands of Peru.<br />The first part of the trilogy is where the reader knows the backgrounds (the dying days of the Inca empire) and the motivations of the main characters.<br />I think this may be the slowest book of the trilogy, but it's very well written and the research seems well done. The three authors deserve the praise to have acomplished a good book with an unusual theme and fairly developed characters.<br />Grade 8.8/10	2003-01-20

Both are part of a series featuring the psychologist-detective Alex Cross, a tough Washington DC cop.<br />&quot;Along came a spider&quot; is an interesting book. It's the first one in the &quot;Cross series&quot;, where the readers are introduced to the main characters that will make part in the series, like Cross, his partner Sampson, Cross family, etc.<br />Patterson has a very peculiar style of narrative. His chapters are usually short, wich makes the reading very fast-paced and thrilling. Also, Patterson has two kinds of narrative: one in the first-person where we see what Alex Cross is experiencing and believing, and it's a very personal and one-sided narrative; the other style is in third person, where the reader follows the steps of the main suspect of the crime the story is about. So, to be clear, we KNOW who the killer/murderer/kidnapper/whatever is from the very beggining. Does this spoil the plot or the reading? No! Patterson is master in delivering sub-plots, twists, nuances about characters along the book, all very interesting, and they make the pursuit/manhunt very enjoyable.<br />In &quot;Along came a spider&quot;, Gary Soneji is the kidnapper fanatic about the Lindberg case, who intents to make history by taking away two very important children. Cross and his teammates in DC Police, FBI and Secret Service have to stop him before he strikes again. This is just the first plot of the story, and it keeps changing every ten or twenty chapters.<br />One thing I found annoying, though, is that Patterson made Cross something like a super-human being. There were times when I thought Cross was virtually invincible. But that is something minor.<br />What really matters is that Patterson created believable characters in one really good thriller. I will surely read the other books in the series, and I'm waiting for Patterson's incursion in medieval times &quot;The jester&quot;.<br />Grade 8.8/10jester&quot;.<br />Grade 8.8/10	2003-01-06

Don't let its size prevent you from reading it. Stephenson is a very talented writer and I'm surely going to read other books he's written.<br />Now let me try to explain Cryptonomicon for someone who doesn't know a lot about the book.<br />First: the book is divided in two stories, told togheter through the book, although they are separated by fifty years. One passes in the present time, more or less (1998), and its main characters are a bunch of people involved in a project to create a data heaven (something like the Cayman islands, but related to information and means to provide a steady flux of that information) in a tiny sulatanate near the Philipines. The main characters in this part of the story are Randy Waterhouse and Amy Shaftoe, people in charge of implementing that data heaven. The other is set during the second world War, when Lawrence Waterhouse is the brilliant mathematician in charge of decrypting the Axis war codes, and Bobby Shaftoe is the semi-crazy all-terrain soldier in charge of an Army detachment sent on contraditory errands whose intent is not letting the germans and japanese discover that their codes have already been broken. It seems complicated and it is, but Stephenson's style of narrative adjusts well to the dificulties of telling such a strange story. The last names of the characters are, not casually, identical in both parts of the story.<br />Second: there is another division in the plot. This one is not time-related. Suddenly, in the present-time storyline as much as in the World War storyline, there begins a race to discover the lost gold the japanese and the germans were hidding somewhere along the Pacific Rim, involving characters of both timelines! And that's where I was impressed with Stephenson. He was able to write the same plot within two totally different eras. And all this is written in a very intelligent way; Stephenson lays clues of one time story into the other one! Amazing.<br />The characters are really well developed. Stephenson writes not only about what was supposesd to be in the book, but also of ancient computer systems, greek mythology, theology, and many other stuff, that, instead of transforming Cryptonomicon in a boring book, makes it really one of the best I've read in my life. But the eventual reader will have to take his time with this one. This isn't intended to be a fast read. This is intended to be a fantastic read, so go slow and always, and, in the end, you'll be rewarded.<br />Grade 9.7/10cters are really well developed.

Mostly what I read are books of fiction, dealing with certain aspects of this time period, such as Ken Follett's \\"Eye of the Needle\\", Robert Harris' \\"Enigma\\", etc. Actually, \\"The longest day\\" is the first non-fiction book on WWII I've read. So, what was I expecting? Detailed and technical descriptions of the battles, positions, and so on. What I got was much better.<br />Ryan's research was tremendous. He was able to interview not only veterans of the Allied forces, but many german officers as well. So, instead of a pure technical account of D-day, Ryan could get lots of personal histories of what happened to many of american, british, canadian and german soldiers during June 6, 1944. What's best, Ryan doesn't treat the germans as human monsters, nor the Allied as super-heros. Ryan's vision of the soldiers during the D-day was just what most of them were: men fighting for what they believed correct (of course, Hitler is depicted in a lightly different way).<br />The book is divided in three parts. The first one, \\"The wait\\", is about the preparations and struggles to get operation Overlord ready in time for launch in the right day.

Of course, Caleb Carr was smart enough to perceive that, if he was going to write a novel on serial-killing, he would have to think of a totaly new plot, narration style, twists, characters, etc. OR... he could just write a completely average novel, disguising it in a very subtle and, why not say it, intelligent way. The disguise was the epoch the novel is set in: late XIX century.<br />John Moore is the narrator of the story. He is a newsman, expert in crime stories. Also, he has some important friends: Laszlo Kreizler, a doctor enthusiastic with a new method of studying  Man (psychology) and Theodore Roosevelt (the same), who, at the time, was Chief of Police Dept. in New York. They are all thrown together, in an unauthorized investigation (Roosevelt was attempting to \\"clean\\" NY Police Dpt. of corruption at the time), to catch the murderer of young boy-prostitutes.<br />Though the story is sometimes painfuly slow and has very few and obvious plot-twists, I'm giving it a high rate because it managed to be an enterteinment all the time I was reading it. The characters could be better developed, but there are intelligent lines and situations. The best of \\"The alienist\\", however, is the description Caleb Carr makes of the New York of 1896. As always, we have to rely on the author's capability of putting his research into words (in fact, we have to trust the author's word that he has, in fact, done some research of what he's writing about), and in my opinion Carr does it in a direct and forward manner, making this book a simple and nice read.<br />Although the ending was not to my liking (to sudden and undeveloped) I liked the rest of the book.<br />But, come to think of it, I'm not willing to try (at least not now) Cale Carr's other book, \\"The angel of darkness\\", fetauring the same troupe of characters. If this one was formulaic, what can I think of another book with the same settings, characters, etc? Maybe I'll change my opinion later.<br />Grade 8.5/10 (Just made 5 stars).ith the same settings, characters, etc?

Given the amazing numbers of this kind of books, every now and then you surely are going to step in a bomb and regret the time and money you spent in some terrible story. Fortunately, this is not the case in \\"Falling Angel\\".<br />Harry Angel is a private detective in the New York in the end of the fifties, hired by a misterious character to find a very famous crooner who disppeared in the middle of the WW2. During his investigation, he discovers some terrifying truths, envolving voodoo worship, satanism, black massess, and yet Johnny Favorite, the crooner, is nowhere to be found. In the end, the truth is really amazing, and Harry could never escape it.<br />For those who saw \\"Angel heart\\" before reading this book, I must say the surprise was completely lost. However, Hjortsberg is a fine and talented writer, the book is told in the fast-paced rhythm of New York, and the sucession of scenes is very well programed and easy to follow, and fast to read as well. This is a classic detective story, with lots of sarcasm, murders, twists, and something that you don't find in every down-to-earth detective book: supernatural elements. As strange as it seems, it doesn't spoil the story, in fact these supernaturals combine to enhance the thrilling of the plot. The final two or three chapters are amazing, and the ending is surprising and powerful.<br />Grade 9.5/10	2002-11-14

Although the settings are different, we can see many similarities between the stories, like the implicit criticism of british society of the XVII/XVIII centuries and the importance that society gave to exterior looks.<br />Moll Flanders can be divided in two parts. In the first one, Moll, being poor, is raised in a foster home, and, being pretty, catches the attention of the elder son of the family whose house she lives in. It is when her misfortunes begin. Misled and deceived by this elder son, she has to leave the house and be on her own. When she was a child, she wanted to be a &quot;dame of society&quot;, and that's what she desperately tries to become, looking for a rich man who will support her financialy. To catch the eyes of such men, she has to pretend she is very rich herself, and then all she manages to have are false &quot;gentlemen&quot;, trying themselves to marry a rich woman. Even then, she is able to find a man she loves (more than one, in fact), but through a series of bad luck she always looses everything.<br />The second part of the book is where Moll Flanders transforms herself in a successfull thieve. This is a fun part, where she describes her struggle to accomplish the thefts without being caught and thrown to infamous prison Newgate. And then, the ending seemed a little too sudden to me.<br />Defoe's book is a stinging critic to his society, and that's why he chose to write in a female first-person, self centered (there are almost no other names in the course of the story) and desperate to get to the high level of society, showing that everybody could be affected by hypocrite puritanism and moralism.<br />Grade 8.5/10	2002-11-13

Being a fan of fiction-literature, I noticed how nonexistent were books of fiction with huns as being the main subject, and I was also surprised to find &quot;Attila's treasure&quot; in a used bookstore. The title caught my attention at first, with two words (Attila and treasure) that I always find interesting. The cover, though, reminded me of some of those bad books intended for young and innocent female teenagers. However, it was being sold by a nice price, and I bought it.<br />I had two surprises. Clearly the author (unknown to me until then) deeply understands the ways of medieval germanic and hunnish culture, or (it also can be possible) he deceived me like no one before. There are detailed and numerous scenes of the behavior of the germanic people in a time where the Huns where threatening the borders of the Roman Empire, and also description of the way romans, goths and huns made alliances and enmities furing the fifth century. I think I got what I wanted, to learn something about the huns in a book of fictions. This is the good surprise.<br />The bad surprise is that I, like most people, I think, thought that there was only one historical Attila, the maddened hunnish warlord that invaded and sacked Rome permiting the goths to divide what was left of the Western Roman Empire among themselves, and I thought this was the Attila whose name was on the title of the book. Through the first hundred pages of the book I felt something was strange, than skipped to the afternote by the author in the end of the book. There my suspicions became true. Grundy's book is not about the historical Attila, it's about one other Attila, fictional, born and living some twenty to thirty years before the real one. However, through the story, by way of historical characters that appear on the book, Grundy gives hints about the coming of the real Attila (there's a character in the book, a strong warrior named Rua, whose wife is told by the shaman of the huns she will give birth to three of the most important sons the hunnish people will ever have; Rua was the name of the father of the real Attila). When I learned this, I thought the book was a deceipt, but I thought better and continued to read because it was a nice written and told story about medieval ways, sword-fighting, magic, etc.<br />I liked Grundy's style and the way he seems to know what he's writing about.<br />Grade 8.2/10warrior named Rua, whose wife is told by the shaman of the huns she will give birth to three of the most important sons the hunnish people will ever have; Rua was the name of the father of the real Attila).

The \\"piggies\\" or Little Ones, as they are called, are way down in the technological scale, and the Starways Congress has a very strict set of rules to deal with the Little Ones, after the disastrous first encounter of Humans - Alien Species, described in the war against the Buggers in \\"Ender's game\\".<br />\\"Speaker\\" is set three thousand years after \\"Ender's game\\". \\"Ender\\" is a forbidden word, related to xenocide, something humanity must avoid commiting a second time. Nobody knows that Andrew Wiggin is the original Xenocide and the original Speaker for the Dead. Traveling among the colonized worlds, he is able to live three milleniums because of Relativity.<br />\\"Speaker for the dead\\" deals with the main families and people of Lusitania, a world colonized by catholic brazilians. There, the zenadores and xenobiologists must deal with the Little Ones, and these functions are passed through the families, father to son. But the two main families, Pipo's and Novinha's have conturbed lives. And it is in the middle of these troubled times that Ender, the Speaker for the dead, is called to speak the death of the first Zenador, Pipo, tragically murdered by the Little Ones. Ender has a new chance to combine humanity and a new sentient species.<br />Although an interesting story, those who liked \\"Ender's game\\" will not accept at first the radical change of style Card goes through. \\"Speaker for the dead\\" has not the allucinating chapters and battles, and sometimes the story just drags on. This is, though, a very beautiful and well-though story. I will read \\"Xenocide\\", no doubt about it. I think that books should be rated by the story they contain alone, no comparison to other books. But in this case I will make an exception, and rate this one within the series (compared to \\"Ender's game\\"). That's why I gave it 4 stars.<br />Just another thing: \\"Speaker for the dead\\" is set in Lusitania, a portuguese-speaking world. Being from Brazil, and a portuguese speaker, I know how difficul it is for an english-speaking person to learn and understand portuguese, since it's a very complex language, one of the most complex of the latin languages. Card does a good job in trying to explain the basics of portuguese in the introduction of the book, though there are some serious mistakes in pronunciation and writing. There are some mistakes in the names of some of the characters, mainly the name of the Mayor of Lusitania: Faria Lima Maria do Bosque. \\"Faria Lima\\" is a compose last name, and \\"Maria\\" a first name. I think this is not an intentional mistake; the correct name should be Maria Faria Lima do Bosque. Card is right to give nicknames to his lusitanian characters, since in Brazil and also in Portugal it is a common practice. There are other minor mistakes regarding portuguese language and brazilian culture. But the major mistake is this: in one of the first pages, Card says that the habitants of Lusitania are \\"brazilian by culture\\". Well if they are brazilian, they would NEVER name their planet after Portugal's historical name.

But that's it. In the middle, just so the story would have a plot, there's the thing about the black hole graviting through Earth's central core, and the struggle of a team of scientists to stop it and to find who was responsible for it.<br />I think Brin tried to hold all the world with this book, and came up with a flat story. Yes, it's nice to read some of the passages concerning ecological development in the Planet for the next half century, but that was about it. The characters appearances were so spaced and so inocuous that I didn't feel related to them; in fact, in the end I couldn't care less if they were able to save the planet or not. There's something else with Brin's books: he uses some complex concepts and explains very little of them. Sometimes the reader, being ignorant about the science facts that he's reading about, stops trying to understand, and then the story looses most of its fun. We could see this problems, altough in a minor scale, in books as &quot;Startide Rising&quot; and &quot;The postman&quot;. I think Brin likes to create his stories trying to pass to the readers a sense of mistery that sometimes doesn't work well in science fiction.<br />&quot;Earth&quot; could be better developed in lots of aspects.<br />Grade 6.8/10	2002-10-28

I began to read the books by Maurice Leblanc when I was a teenager, and since them I read them all. Since I'm blessed with the gift of forgetting plots, stories, characters and such, I could read those books featuring Arsene Lupin as many times as I wanted, and I always enjoyed them as if I was reading them for the first time.<br />Leblanc was able to create the most spectacular character of all time. Better than Sherlock Holmes, better than Hercule Poirot, Auguste Dupin, better than anything I have ever read till today (I'm 25 now).<br />Lupin is, to say little, complex. He is capable of loving and hating with the same passion. He can hate a friend and he can love an enemy with all his heart. Leblanc thought him as a Robin Hood of his time. Possessing a fine eye for art, books, women and deciphering secrets, Lupin has lived many lifes as different people, each one better than the other. In his bboks, Leblanc created the plots using parts of french history, including treasures, landscape, hidden tunnels, immortal characters, wars, etc.<br />This collection of short stories is just an introduction to the wonderful world of Arsene Lupin and to his world. There are many books featuring Lupin, and in my opinion the best are, in order:<br />813; The hollow needle; Crystal Stopper; Teeth of the tiger; The Comtesse de Cagliostro; The eight strokes of the clock; The Eunerville Secret. All these books are wonderful adventures, and should be re-edited in english as soon as possible.<br />Grade 9.5/10	2002-10-07

This is pure SK. &quot;Rose Madder&quot; has all elements that make King a great writer (I have read more than 20 of his books).<br />Rose Daniels is the abused wife who suddenly escapes the prison that was her marriage. In a new city, she discovers a people who will help her get over her violent husband and a life of abuses. Then she founds a new job, and, possibly, a man totally different from Norman Daniels, her husband.<br />But Norman won't let it go at that. He will go after her to hell if needed, and if he finds her, he will send Rose right there, if he can.<br />Norman and Rose are extremely interesting characters. They are complex, real and very well developed. When a writer is able to have characters like that, the story can be nothing but good. Norman is raving mad, but in the middle of that madness he is able to find some lucidity and act accordingly to get to his final objective. Rose finds in her new life the strength she always needed and couldn't get because she knew nothing else.<br />Sometimes people forget fiction is just what it is: immagination; it all came from someone's head. Of course, this book, like most stories, has its flaws, either psychological or factual, but fiction, at this level, is pure enterteinment and should be treated accordingly.<br />&quot;Rose Madder&quot; is like other books by Stephen King. &quot;Bag of Bones&quot; and &quot;Dreamcatcher&quot;, for example. They blend day-today facts with a little &quot;unusual&quot; stuff. King does that very well, and I think this &quot;unusual&quot; counts in a positive way.<br />Grade 8.6/10	2002-10-02

The relationship among this threesome is very complex, with most interesting and well developed characters.<br />Setted during and after the second world war, Bendrix's life suddenly looses all meaning when Sarah stops seeing him out of nowhere. During the book, Bedrix discovers why Sarah left him, and develops a most unusual relationship with Henry. This story is also about belief and memory connected. What happens when someone you love is no longer with you? Is it possible that him/her is watching the ones left behind, hearing their thoughts, and helping them? What happens when you don't believe in anything about religion, and then you loose someone very dear to you? What do you believe in then, when there's proof everywhere that this someone is still connected to you? Or is it just one's imagination? These are some of the questions this book puts on a reder's mind. Reading the book one has to stop after a few pages and wonder what one would do if the story was personal. More than good fiction, &quot;The end of the affair&quot; is a novel that has a meaning and a purpose.<br />This is one of the best of Greene's works, along with &quot;The third man&quot;.

After the King Solomon's mines, Quatermain is back in England, where his son dies, and he's eager for new adventures. With his two best friends, Good and Curtis, they depart again to the heart of Africa, where they expect to discover a nation of white people undiscovered until now.<br />This story, while a classic Haggard tale, has not all the good elements \\"King Solomon's mines\\" had. There is fighting, there's thrilling, but this book is somewhat slower. This might be because Allan Quatermain, telling the story in his point of view, is older, close to sixty-five years. In fact, there are some really anoying parts, where Quatermain is extra-shy and puritan, almost to the point of being ridiculous. And, as another reviewer wrote, there's no point in writing about a white race, civilized, organized and secret, in the heart of Africa, instead of a more plausible black one. This can only be excused in historical contexts. Back in the late XIX century, Africa was such a type of novelty and unknown that people thought almost everything could happen in there. But, today, if the reader doesn't have an open mind and doesn't know his History, this can be interpreted as pure racism, which is not. Haggard wrote this book in a time where the biggest thing about Africa was Livingstone trying to find where the Nile came from.<br />So this is how this book should be taken.

Allie calls himself an &quot;inventor&quot;, trying to make his life better by ways of using stuff at hand and putting them together in the form of new machinery.<br />Tired of the life in the United States, he predicts doom will fall over his native country, and takes his family (his wife and four children) to a deserted spot in rural Honduras. There, he builds an ice machine in an effort to make all people surrounding him, even native indians, believe his way of life is better than any other. But suddenly things star to go wrong...<br />The story is told by Allie's elder son, Charlie. Like everybody else in the Fox family, he desperately tries to believe his father is something close to a god. But the problem is that each page of the book shows an Allie madder and more tyranical than the page before. That's what is best in Theroux novel. Allie is so simple he becames suddenly complex. He has everybody in an iron grip, but when the environment turns against him he doesn't realize that grip isn't strong enough.<br />The book can be divided in three parts: leaving USA, the Jeronimo village and the end. While the first is plainly introductory and the second is mostly descriptional (sometimes they get pretty slow) the final part is as histerical and raving mad as Allie Fox. This third part is enough to give the book an upgrading from four to five stars.<br />A very good book.<br />Grade 8.7/10	2002-09-20

Through the book, he tells us the story of his family in India.<br />The only other book I'd read by Rushdie was \\"Haroun and the sea of stories\\", which is really wonderful, although directed to younger readers. The only other Indian author i've read is Arundathi Roy (\\"The god of small things), this one an \\"older-people\\" author, and I didn't enjoy her book. So, this one was a try in Rushdie's grown-up books, out of curiosity.<br />He is really very good in character development, not only about the main character, but everyone that surrounds him and has a more-than-slight participation in the story. What other authors do with plots, Rushdie do with people: they seem very different and un-related at the beggining, and are all tied up at the end.<br />The story itself has plenty of extraordinary elements, and is sometimes detached of reality, particularly in the end.<br />I'ver read many reviews saying that, since this is Rushdie's first book since \\"Satanic Verses\\", they expexted a dark and hateful book, but found \\"The moor's last sigh\\" to be very light and happy and optimistic. Well, in my view, the story in \\"The moor's last sigh\\" is VERY sad and dark. It's possible to trace  similarities between Rushdie's and Moraes' lives. Both of them have a curse and a deformity they don't understand and didn't ask to be brought upon them, and their lives will (or may) be shortened because of something external to their ways.<br />I don't give this book five stars because of the differences in the pace of the narrative (sometimes it was too slow, mostly in the middle, and sometimes it was too fast, like in the rushed ending) and because of the great number of unreal or fantastic elements in the story, which are not to my taste.<br />Grade 8.3/10	2002-09-11

Garp's life is full of accidents and neurosis, though he claims he wants to live an usual kind of life. In fact, this book is a little of neurotic itself, to be read in a fast pace though the events in it seem quite slow and consecutive; but when you stop a little, you have to think about just what happened.<br />I don't know if it's intentional, but Irving describes Garp in a way that he could be one of his disturbed characters (Garp is a writer). Some of the best parts in the book is when Irving writes using Garp's hands; there are entire chapters \\"written\\" by Garp, filled with his stories, and it's very difficult for an author to change his style of writing in the middle of a work, something John Irving does quite naturaly.<br />In all, a beautiful and interesting book.<br />Grade 8.9/10	2002-08-28

He can have no friends, no grown-up will be there to help him in his personal struggles against older boys filled with envy, he's taken from his family and his beloved sister... This could be a terrible life, but Ender's sense of responsibility always drags him back to his supposed duty.<br />Orson Scott Card was able to create a sci-fi story in the middle of a, let's say, story of a life. The reader will always stay with Ender (except in the chapters when we are told Ender's brothers lives, but that helps to understand his relations to his family and some of what happens to him when he's away in Battle School, and some of what happens near the end of the book); we will see him become a master of military strategy, and we will see him abandon everything he holds dear in order to achieve a greater feat.<br />There were parts of &quot;Ender's game&quot; that reminded me of other books, such as &quot;Lord of the flies&quot;, &quot;Starship troopers&quot;, and some others, and I think that's a high compliment.<br />This is not your common sci-fi book, it is something much more subtle and has many levels of meanings, but can be read just as a good entertainment, so enjoy.<br />Grade 9.5/10	2002-08-23

Being written by one of the best science fiction authors of our age, the least someone can expect is to have great fun reading them.<br />Some of the stories, though, are really short, therefore they don't have much development, being just interesting concepts and mind teasers.<br />The longer ones are mostly the struggle of one central character against some hazard or life threat, based on scientifical facts used to develop the whole plot.<br />Since Clarke wrote those stories between the sixties and early seventies, it's also interesting to see what expections people related to science had thiry or forty years ago, and notice that science developments had taken a totaly different turn, now mostly applied to our day-to-day life.<br />In all, this book is less complex than other Clarke books, like \\"Songs from distant Earth\\", or \\"Rendezvous with Rama\\", and easier to read, but not more enjoyable. Read it to complete your Clarke-knowledge.<br />Grade 8.0/10	2002-08-14

This is the best part of the Harry Potter series: they grow more intelligent with each book.<br />Other fact that comes to testify the good writing of Rowling is this book winning the best-novel title in the Hugo Award, joining a gallery of which are part books like \\"Foundation\\", \\"Ringworld\\", \\"Startide Riding\\", \\"Ender's game\\" and so many other excellent ones.<br />In \\"Goblet of fire\\" we see Harry Potter no more as a kid, but as a young man already. As always, new and interesting characters are introduced to make company to Rony, Hermione, Hagrid and professor Dumbledore, among others.<br />The story of this fourth book is much more un-childish and serious, as is Harry himself. The final hundred pages can be said to be dark, with a touch of noir. And, reaching the middle of the series, we have something that will haves us, Harry Potter fans, completely hooked for the final three books.<br />Grade 9.6/10	2002-08-08

Tolkien Boxed Set (The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings)	Books	5	0	0	N	N	The very best ever	This is the mother of modern fantasy stories.<br />\\"Te lord of the rings is the tale of the Middle-Earth. The biggest proof of its grandeur and its quality is the fact that almost everybody has heard at least something about Tolkien's talent and his unforggetable characters like Frodo, Aragorn, Gandalf, Elrond and Sauron, just to name a few.<br />The quiet hobbits, simbolyzing the purity and innocence of a world where the existence of Evil is incredibly strong, must travel to the heart of an accursed kingdom, and there destroy a powerful ring in the flames of the mountain where it was forged. During their journey they meet strong allies to get safely to the end of their quest, always trying to defeat the enemies the Dark Lord, who also wants the ring for its incredible power, sends in the fellowship's way.<br />\\"The Lord of the Rings\\" is a story with many meanings and can be read in many ways. Bottom line, it's the Story of Good against Evil, but can be interpreted as, for example, a re-reading of the story of Christianity.<br />Besides, Tolkien's dedication to his work is impressive, writing an unique and complete tale, including inventing a whole new language for the elven people, a complete genealogy for the \\"houses of men\\", complete maps of the places where the story was past.<br />\\"The Lord of the rings\\" must be read and re-read many times, and the fantasy in its pages is a timeless source of pleasure for one who likes adventures like this.<br />Grade 10/10	2002-08-06

He is the best when it comes to tell a story of a place, not of a person. Recently there has been some followers of this kind of books, like Edward Rutherfurd, who is a good author, but not like Michener.<br />Caribbean is a very long book, telling almost a millenium of history of one of the most enchanting places on Earth. Michener is able, through sixteen short stories, to narrate what happened on the various islands and main parts of the continent (like northern Colombia and eastern Mexico) since the time of the pre-colombian indians, passing through spanish domination, the attacks of english and french pirates and buccaneers, the abuse of the black people turned into slaves, till comunism in the form of Castro in Cuba. More, he is able to relate all what was happening in the Caribbean related to what was happening in the foremost countries in Europe, and the rising participation of the United States in the international scenario.<br />One thing I think it's really important when an author wishes to blend various real facts with his immagination efforts is to inform his readers what is fact and what is fiction, and in Caribbean Michener has a list of actual facts of each chapter and a bibliography of each subject for readers who want to learn further. This kind of attention to the reader is something we don't see too often, and everyone who likes a well written book should mourn Michener's passing away, as well as be glad he was so prolific and intense while writing.<br />This book is as colorful as the place of its name.<br />Grade 8.8/10	2002-08-05

There are two problems with Easy Rawlings, though. As happens with all Mosley books, the plots are kind of misty, you just don't know for sure what Rawlings must do or discover through the story. Other thing I find extremely annoying is that, except Rawlings, other characters are completely undeveloped, they're just names thrown into the story, making it a little confusing, you almost never know who is who and what part they seem to take in the plot.<br />Easy Rawlings is a funny character, though a little too stupid. He acts before he thinks. Mosley thinks this is a means to provide action in the book and it works well, but I thought Easy was rather obtuse sometimes. But maybe Mosley just wanted to create a story as close to reality as possible. As in \\"Devil in a blue dress\\", the most interesting character is Mouse, Easy's friend, a murderer without scruples, who should get a book of his own.<br />I'll give a try to \\"White Butterfly\\", the next book in the series.<br />Grade 7.3/10	2002-08-01

Young Edmont Dantes, of Marseilles, is a good-natured and competent man, and, being so, many of his acquaintances long to have him out of the way. Four people, for different reasons, throw him, using a series of schemes, in a jail where he will pass the rest of his life. But in the ill-famed Chateau d'If he discovers a secret that leads to an incredible wealth, and he is able to escape and work his life on the sole purpose of destroying his ancient enemies.<br />We must understand that Dumas wrote this masterpiece on the apogee of romantism, and that is what Monte Cristo is: the utmost romantic story. And even if the potencial reader should think that, being written in the past century, it's going to be lots of cliches and known plots, think again. I don't want to spoil anything but to Edmont Dantes his revenge is not like what he thought it was going to be.<br />The book is very long and sometimes even boring, with sub-plots seemingly leading to nowhere, just to be all sewn up in the very end. The best part, however is the inicial (the first 200 pages, more or less), when we see Dantes' life fall apart and he looses everything he cares for. This part is so well and pationately written, allowing similarities with Kafka's &quot;The Trial&quot;, but wherever Kafka is dark and cold, Dumas is colorful and emotive.<br />Dumas is one of the best nineteenth century writers and has left a vast amount of works. This is, in my opinion, his best and should be read by everybody who is interested in good literature.<br />Grade 8.7/10	2002-07-30

In arriving, he meets Mattie and Kyra, and falls in love with both of them, to the point of supporting them morally and financially in a law struggle against Max Devore, Mattie's ex-father in law. This is one of the plots. The other one is: Mike is trying to find why his wife hid her pregnancy before dying. He thinks that's very strange. But that's not the only thing haunting Mike. His house has ghostly noises, in the plumbing, in the cellar, everywhere. These two situations combine to take Mike's life out of a deep descent into oblivion.<br />Stephen King has created, in \\"Bag of Bones\\", a very enjoyable book. There are a few things similar to \\"Rebecca\\". The house has an almost madly gripping feeling towards Noonan, to the point that it is in itself one of the most important characters. As the story goes on, King leads his main character through discoveries, using an intelligent and interesting artifact: when Mike is in \\"the zone\\", he is able to go back in time and find out what really happened. Mattie is also a very likable character. She has suffered a lot in her life and the reader wants her to get well with Mike. On the other side, the \\"bad\\" people are also interesting. Max Devore is one of the most mean characters I've ever found. He's mean just for the pleasure of being mean and achieving what he wants. That's it. In this book you plainly know who are the good and the bad people. I mean, if they're the living ones. 'Cause when it's about the ghosts, you never know who they are or what they're after. You just discover along with Mike, since he is the one who tells the story.<br />There are some memorable scenes in this book. The climax part, the final two chapters are plainly madness, and I just kept rereading the amazing parts. This is a psycological thriller with all the elements Stephen King loves to provide. I just didn't gave it a 5 star rating because SOME of those elements sometimes get a little too repetitive. There were parts that I already knew what was going to happen just by reading other SK books.<br />One final comment. I think Amazon.com should allow reviewers to rate the books in grades from 1 to 10 instead of 1 to 5.

For some time I've been looking to read any book of the Uplift trilogies, and the reader's reviews in [Amazon.com] guided me to Startide Rising, even if it is not the first book of the Uplift trilogy nº1. After reading STR I think Sundiver cannot be better anyway.<br />I had never read anything about David Brin, but being an author who has received so much praise I expected much from him. Well, he didn't disappoint me. Startide Rising is one of the most original sci-fi stories I've ever run into, and I put the thinking behind the writing in the \\"Amazing\\" category, along \\"Foundation\\" and \\"End of Eternity\\" by Asimov and \\"Rendezvous with Rama\\" by Clarcke.<br />The story is like this: in the future, man has been able to \\"elevate\\" intelligent animal species like the chimpanzee and the dolphin to a kind of consciousness similar to humans themselves.<br />The Universe is defined by The Five Galaxies, and in these galaxies there are a grand number of other Star-Traveling Species. Each one of these alien species has, each in its turn, being a low form of life, and has been developed by a sponsor species. Nobody knows who the original sponsors species were, and no one knows which species developed humankind.<br />The \\"Streaker\\" is a spaceship commanded an crewd by dolphins, humans and a scientist chimp. When the story begins, they are hidding in a non-charted acquatic world. They're hiding because they found a space-caravan of very, very old ships, as big as moons. These enormous ships are thought to belong to a long-vanished species, which can be the \\"Progenitors\\", creators of all other species. Inside on of these ships was found the body of an alien, and it becomes the prize every species in the five galaxies want to retrieve. While the Streaker is fighting against time to be repaired and depart the strange world of Kithrup, the aliens fight among themselves to reach the dead body the humans have.<br />Brin writes in a most dettached way. He doesn't have to explain in detail the sci-fi stuff contained in the book, because he writes it in self-explaining sentences and paragraphs, not to mention the Glossary he included in the start of the story. The chapters are named after their main characters, so the reader can be deeply acquainted with every character in the book. The relations between dophins and humans are really well-developed and obviously constant during the lenght of the book. There's even a mistery plot (why are some of the dolphins wilder than others?), plenty of suspense and the linking to other books in the series.<br />Brin has created a sci-fi masterpiece, and all awards he received were well deserved.<br />Grade ...of Kithrup, the aliens fight among themselves to reach the dead body the humans have. <br />Brin writes in a most dettached way.

Burr's life, his participation in the independence of the US, the fact that he killed Alexander hamilton in a duel, the suspicion that he was father to future (past now) president Martin van Buren, all this makes Aaron Burr's life an interesting subject for a book. I don't really like proper biographies, I rather enjoy them if they're fictionalized.<br />Vidal, although he thinks of himself much more than he is, is an extremely able writer. He takes the reader, through the eyes of a fictional character, the lawyer/jornalist Charlie Schuyler, for a tour in Washington DC and New York from the early ninteenth century. Costumes, people, politics are described in a light and amusing tone.<br />\\"Burr\\" is lighter and easier to read than \\"Lincoln\\", for example; this may happen because of the nature of the main character. Lincoln is taciturn, introspective, while Burr is expansive and talkative.<br />Among Vidal's american chronicles I think \\"Burr\\" is the best book.<br />Grade 8.3/10	2002-06-05

The life of the venetian adventurer certainly is a good source for any writers whose novels are based on historical fiction. The point here is not knowing if Jennings made an accurate portrait of Polo's life, but ot enjoy Jenning's description of Polo's life.<br />The book style itself is very similar to that of Aztec, although not nearly tragedic as the life of Mixtli. Marco Polo's story is well known, even eight centuries after it happened. It is said nobody believed the things he told about he far east, and if this book so much as resembles the real history, I myself couldn't believe everything either. Even today oriental way of life is very different than the ocidental way.<br />Jennings describes places, people, religions and his favorite matter, sex, with the usual boldness and hilarity.<br />A very fine book, almost as good as Aztec.<br />Grade 9.1/10	2002-06-05

One night he lies awake and engages in a conversation with a most strange character, who talks (while smoking a joint) about a heavenly beach nearby.<br />The next morning, Richard discovers that the strange man has commited suicide, but he also discovers a drawn map informing him how to reach the beach.<br />From then on Garland describes the odissey Richard and some friends endure to get to the famous beach. And then their life in the months they spend in the beach community.<br />Although written in the most casual way, this book is rich in character development, not only regarding the main character, who is also the narrator, but of Richard's closest friends and acquaintances on the beach as well. Richard, however, is the most complex, even though he is not aware of the fact. Garland constructed Richard to be almost a symbol of the person who watched Apocalypse Now in the early teens and is fascinated by a world of adventures, jungles, asiatic people with menacing looks pointing firearms. Richard is so alienated from reality that he sees everything as a kind of game, like the ones he enjoys so much.<br />This is a nice and fast read complex in its apparent simplicity.	2002-05-24

Similar to Aztec, The physician, Pillars of the Earth. However, Lawhead's style is slower and lacks a bit of action. Sometimes the plot seems to be crawling endlessly to nowhere, the passages are obvious and the reader just doesn't care about the characters.<br />Aidan is the irish monk who is sent to Byzantium to deliver a gift to the Emperor Basil. There are other reasons for this trip, but since the story is given on first-person basis, what Aidan doesn't know the reader won't know either. Aidan is a character whose propension to doing good is so huge that sometimes it's irritating. Lawhead tried to add some depth to his character, making him loose his faith in God, but this part of Aidan's story was very poorly developed. Even some love scenes are thrown in in the middle of the book (between an irish monk and an arab female!), but they are tedious, even embarassing.<br />Byzantium is, to conclude, an interesting book that must not be taken too seriously. And don't be scared by the size of the book, it is a very fast reading.	2002-04-17

Creation is a more thoughtful and more subtle work, and Lincoln is amazingly truthful and very rich in details, altough an american reader will like it more than a non-american one.<br />In these two works I was very glad to find that Vidal is propense to make comedy, with amusing lines and laughable conversation.<br />Julian is a different kind of book. To tell the story of the roman emperor dubed The Apostate, the one who tried to restrain Christianity and go back to helenism, Vidal uses the system of a letter correspondence between Prisco and Libanius, two of Julian friends or advisors. Prisco and Libanius don't like each other and exchange veiled accusations in their letters, and that's the fun part of the book. Libanius has Julian notations and memories, so it's Julian who tells his own story, Prisco and Libanius only commenting when they find it necessary.<br />Julian wanted to be only a philosopher, he was thrown to the throne against his will, he had to hold back his feelings against the christians, being nephew to Constantine the Great, the emperor who ruled christianity as Rome's official religion. He stayed only a couple if years as emperor, he was adored as much as hated, he became one of the most important general of his time ans he was finally misteriously murdered.<br />But, unlike other roman emperors known to be raving mad assassins, Julian was a calm, thinking governant.<br />Although in my oppinion Vidal thinks of himself much more than he really ought to, this book is one of the best and most entertaining I ever read.<br />Grade 9.2/10	2002-04-10

One is extremely rich, the other has a childhood of poverty, emprisionment and doubts. They meet in America under special circumstances, ans their lives will never be the same again.<br />The beggining of the book is very good and well written, in a psychological way, to say the least. Archer is able to show the reader the early life of William and Wladek using a system that alternates chapters between his two main characters.<br />However, after they meet, the story seems to get a little too futile, each character trying only to destroy the other's life. I thought this was very shallow. And the fact that their children get together is a punch-line so beaten that I can only understand that it was Archer's hook to write another novel, &quot;The prodigal daughter&quot;.<br />William and Abel got old too quickly, and the final quarter of the book, where they are older men, has too many events, poorly dealt with. Also, the ending was unsattisfatory, but again I must suppose that he was already thinking about the sequel when he wrote the final passages of &quot;Kane &amp; Abel&quot;.<br />I rate this book four stars for the early chapters.	2002-04-08

His life gets complicated when he makes himself invisible, thinking he can do almost anything he wants, since nobody can see him. The problem is, he's a little bit crazy, and gets very angry when he can't get his wishes done.  Wells created a very interesting character in Griffin. If he was a nice guy, the story simply couldn't exist. Griffin is a complete selfish person, revolted by the fact that he is an albino, and through invisibility he wants the world at his feet. But he's such a disastrous person that he does everything wrong, and has everyone he has contact with against him.  Although the story is over a century old, it still grips the reader. It's a simple story, but one of the pillars of the modern science fiction. There would be no Asimov, no Heinlein, no Scott Card, no Stanley Robinson without existing Wells before them.	2001-08-23

The narrative is smooth, making the reader walk with them as they deceive Tibet's authorities and thieves, finding friendship among the nomads, spending months across the country. Reaching Lhasa, the story changes to the way of life of the Tibetans, and his own, as he comes to consider Tibet his new home. He is able to picture the religious festivities, the fundaments of their budhaism, the social skills, the way the people see their God-king, the Dalai Lama. The only part of the story I think is not well developed enough is his relationship with the Dalai Lama, he spents only the last final two chapters with it.  The end of the book is a little too quick, which represents the way he was forced by the chinese to leave Tibet. A very good book, and one can learn a lot about Tibet with it. The real stuff, not the kind of things you hear when some fancy movie star says he's budhist.	2001-08-22

The plot is based on the Bowden family: Sam, the father, Carol, his wife, and the three kids, Nancy, who will turn fifteen soon, and the younger Jamie and Bucky.  During World War II, some thirteen years before, Sam Bowden prevented Max Cady, a young private, from raping an australian girl in Melbourne. Cady was tried, convicted and sent to prison in a forced-labour camp for life. Unfortunatelly for Bowden, he was released and has come after him and his family back in the US. Although the book is quite short, MacDonald is able to develop two of the main characters. The story is focused only in the Bowden family, which means Max Cady only appears when he interacts with them. And that's too bad, cause Cady could have been more active, allowing the reader to get to know him better. So, he's kind of a evil presence hanging over the story, and even if it's bad for the reader's personal taste, it's good for the plot. What we do know is that he is a total psycho, and his only intent in life is to end the Bowdens'lives.  Sam Bowden is the lawyer who lives his life the way he makes his living: in complete accordance to the laws. His life turns upside down when he realises his only chance against Cady is getting harm done to him, which goes against his conscience. And Carol is the most interesting character of all, like a Scarlett O'Hara, she doesn't mind what things she must do in order to achieve her objectives.  I think the story could be a little longer, making more explicit the relationship between Cady and the Bowdens, the way it was in the movie featuring De Niro. Also, Cady is too good a character to be spent the way he was in the plot.  All in all, a good book, just too short.	2001-08-16

Rainbow six is fun to read, and you should read it if you've come this far, since Hunt for Read October, passing through Cardinal of the Kremlin, Executive Orders, etc etc. OK, this book is interesting, though the premise is a little bit ethereous. If I was John Brightling (he's one of the central characters), had all of his money, I would try to do something nicer to the world, instead of... oh, but let's not spoil things for the eventual reader. The plot(s) is (are) good(s), even though I've seen Clancy do better: it's his usual stuff, but, as Austin Powers would say, he lost some of his MOJO. But the ending... I can Imagine this conversation between Clancy and his editor: TC \\"Look, editor I'm in the middle of the book, and see how MANY pages I managed to write this far! \\" ED \\"Mr. C., are you nuts? Can't you see your usual reader can't stand books two thousand pages long anymore, and the infinite plots that don't have ending... I think you should finish it as it is.\\" TC \\"OK, I'll do that.\\" And the book is over, with an almost comic ending, that should be taken by Roberto Benigni as a start line for a new comedy.<br />Grade 6.0/10	2001-08-09

But I thought it would just be another story featuring aliens, laser-blasting wars and so on, just like Starship Troopers, which also won those prizes (both Nebula and Hugo, I think); the difference is that I didn't enjoy Starship Troopers the least bit, and found Forever War one of the most interesting reads I've ever had. No wonder this book won a number of science fiction prizes. It's well written, in the first person, telling the story of William Mandella, a physics-graduate drafted by the army to fight against the alien Taurans. The problem is, humans meet aliens passing through \\"collapsars\\", going from one point of the galaxy to another in virtually zero time for those experiencing the thing, even though relativistic theory makes people in Earth wait centuries for the return of the warriors. When Mandella comes back from his first battles, he finds a different Earth, the cities, population behavior, way of life: he can't addapt to either of it. So, he enlists again, runing away from his own future, feeling being in battle is better than being a stranger at home. The first person narrative is perfect for a story this big: the reader knows only what Mandella wants him to know, and he's kind of didactic too, explaining some interesting science fiction stuff as it happens during the story. But the best thing in the book isn't the Science, it's the way Earth changes during the thousand-plus years of the war. Though the ending is totally predictable (maybe it wasn't when the book was written), but it's nice for the whole story.	2001-08-09

Carrie is a very unique character. She grew up under the surveillance of a very religious and controling mother who believed that everything related to sex was demoniac. In that kind of environment, the kid couldn't be anything but kind of crazy herself. That would be fine, if she wasn't motive of laughter in the school, and if she hadn't one very special power: telekinetics. The book is very easy to read. The reader must pay attention to every detail, so one can fully understand the subtleties of the plot. For example, the name of the protagonist is Carrie (a carrier) White (the innocence). Very good for a first try. Congratulations, Mr King.	2000-02-01

I must adnit that Hoeg made a good effort to create a character of his opposite sex, and did it very well. Smilla is the most believable thing in the whole book, if not the only one. She's strong and stubborn, mixing  these two kinds of personality to her own advantege. But, unlike Smilla,  all the other characters are weak, and boring.  The book is divided in  three parts, and only the first one, in the city of Copenhaggen, is  interesting, telling how Smilla tries to solve the misterious death of a  young neighbour. But when she gets into the ship that takes her to  Greenland, the plot becomes confused, making the reader want to skip parts.  The end is the worst part. It seems that even Hoeg himself got tired of  the book, and just ended it putting a final dot in some point he found  interestingm thinking that people would think him a genious creating such  an odd end like that. Well, that didn't work out with me. I don't know what  happened with Smilla, Fojl, Tork. In the movie the producers made the  ending different, so people wouldn't throw popcorn on the screen before the  lights go on.  A good start thrown away. Hoeg is not the modern Shakespeare  other reviwers think him to be.	1998-11-15

The action takes place in a  beach in the moved-on world, and Roland has to walk along the beach finding  doors that lead him to OUR known New York, where he enters the mind of  people he has to drag to HIS world and help him in the quest of his Dark  Tower. The story is completely unbelievable, but one who buys any book of  this series must know that this in fact is a work of pure fantasy, like  &quot;The eyes of the dragon&quot;. The book is packed with the usual King  stuff: crazy unknown animals, one heroine-addicted, one woman with two  different personalities, and a lunatic whose hobby is to push people to  death.  It's a very, very odd book. I regret the fact that the Man in Black  has so little part in the story. For me, he's King's character I like best.  This book has little to do with the first one in the series, &quot;The  Gunslinger&quot;. They share the main character, Roland, and his purpose in  life, reaching the infamous Tower. Nothing else. There are some parts  really funny, specially when Roland is in our world and has problems  related to our language. I think King shouldn't have spent a whole book  with this plot. It's an easy read, enjoyable. I just hope &quot;The  wastelands&quot; is better. And I surely hope King has a REAL BIG surprise  waiting his custom readers when Roland reaches the Tower.	1998-10-07

I mean, all those other reviews down there really  tell what this book is like. Ken Follett at his best. And THAT is  something, huh? &quot;The Needle&quot; Faber is the only german spy in  english soil that can turn the war back for the Nazis, as he learned the  secret that Churchill was hiding so well with the help of the americans.  The book tells his adventures up the Brittany Island in order to contact a  U-boat. The final sequency on Storm Island is something of a genious.  Follett has written some very good thrillers about WWII, like this one and  &quot;Night over water&quot;. But his best still is &quot;The key to  Rebecca&quot;. Anyway, &quot;Eye of the needle&quot; is a page turner like  Grisham in his early years, a book one with interests in spies and the War  won't regret reading.	1998-09-27

Forsyth has written some of the best spy-thrillers, in an universe filled  with LeCarr&eacute;s, Folletts, Deightons and so on. His earlier books, such as  &quot;The day of the Jackal&quot; and &quot;The Odessa file&quot; are  simply marvelous pieces of research and storytelling.  This book, &quot;The  Deceiver&quot;, portraits what happens to a british spy when the Cold War  is over: his superiors are trying to give him an early retirement, since  he's no use in these peaceful days. Maybe Forsyth wrote the story ( I mean,  the four stories ), thinking what was going to happen to HIM, and other  writers alike, since their primary plot in the real world was shattered  altogether with the Berlim Wall. And I guess Forsyth wasn't that much  worried.  The first story is the heaviest one, with a psychological side.  As the book goes on, you get to know the hero, MacCready, not only as a  spymaster, but mainly as a person, an individual. The last story is the  best one, in a mood that resembles the Agatha Christie's Poirot's detective  cases.  Highly recommended to people who want to learn more about Forsyth  himself.	1998-09-27

Follett has done a  good job in picturing the struggle between a british army captain and a  ruthless Nazi-spy, called &quot;the Sphinx&quot; in the streets of Cairo  and through the desertic egyptian country. Also, the sensuality is a  constant and present part of the plot, involving a beautiful young jewish  girl working to defeat her tough past and to guarantee a safe future for  her and her people.

To read &quot;Inca Gold&quot; and find it enjoyable, you must start reading it knowing that it isn't serious. Like in the Indiana Jones movies, everything is gonna be okay in the end, your hero will find a way to escape imminent death, and arrive in time to rescue the pretty girl and all his friends. Knowing this, you're able to start to read. Then you'll have fun. You can't compare Cussler's work with Tom Clancy, for an example. While Clancy almost begs the reader to be taken seriously, inserting in the text a huge amount of technical information, Cussler lets the text go its way. It's almost like he's telling you a funny story that happened to him.  But &quot;Inca Gold&quot; is very cool. The story starts when an ancient Inca pit, now filled with water, is explored by an american archeological team, and they find out a time-hidden passageway underwater. From there on, art-smuggling bandits, corrupt governments and poor mexican-village people pop out of Cussler imagina! ! tion. Don't get me wrong, it'a good book, only too implausible. Dirk Pitt is what Cussler would like to be. He's every body childhood superhero, he's got historical cars ( Cussler does, also ), women knocking at his door, doesn't need to work for money, and has a full-time italian-bulldog bodyguard, Al Giordino, his best friend.  This is a good book when you want to turn your life off, and don't think of anything, even what you're reading. The story explains itself sooner or later. The only difficulty is the number of characters. There's a time when you don't know who's who. Even Cussler himself does a little appearance in the middle of the book.  If you want to have fun and don't want to be smashed by information and hard-facts, this is the book, and I think all Cussler's books must be like this, too. Well, I just bought &quot;Raise the Titanic!&quot;, let's see what it's like.	1998-07-14

Most writers did it very well, like John LeCarr&eacute; and Frederick Forsyth.  So that's what this last book by Forsyth is all about: the new era, mostly for Russia. The action is passed in yhe near future, 1999, in the world's biggest country. Without the support of the state, the country is now owned by the underground mafia, and is a paradise to prostituition, killing and poverty. In this scenario, what everybody is willing to do is ascend to the presidency. The UPF an ultra-right party and his foreman, the widely known and liked Mr. Igor Komarov, are a certain name to win the elections to be held soon. But, by accident, the English embassy at Moscow puts hand in an interesting document which is called &quot;Black Manifesto&quot;, containing the ral intentions of UPF and Komarov. So the most powerful people in th! ! e world divises a plan to finish Komarov ascension, calling for the job ex-CIA, Russia-expert Jason Monk, retired from work and spending his life running a fisherboat in the Caribbean.  The book can be divided in two parts. The first one is mostly about Jason Monk and what he accomplished during his time at Langley. It's like a briefing on the main character, and Forsyth writes it so well that you actually fell intimate with Monk. I read in a review below that it's got nothing to do with the rest of the book, but I don't think like that. In fact, I liked this part better.  The second part, about half the book, is ICON properly. It tells how Monk  struggles to prevent Russia of having a Nazi-like dictatorship, with all the Forsyth-ian usual twists, bullet-dodging and games of interest.  I think this book was written when everybody thought Russia as a lost country, and indeed it seemed that would happen. But now I think Russia has got into the right tracks again. Anyway, &quot;I! ! con is a great exercise of imagination, one like Forsyth ga! ves so many times, like the Odessa File. I won't even talk about the Jackal.

But Stephen King made it. &quot;The shining&quot; is thrilling since the beginning to the very last page. It's the story of an ex-teacher thrown out of his job for beating up a student. But the life of Jack Torrance is a complete mess. Not only he's unemployed, he's also a drunk. And in between he's got to take care of his wife and his enigmatic son, Danny. Ah, almost forgot: he has a dream of writing this masterpiece script, a book that will reach the top of the bestselling list. How he can do all this?  His companion in booze and master offers him a job as a caretaker of a famous hotel in Colorado during the winter season. The Overlook Hotel is famous not only because of its great view of the country, but for his shaky story. Built early in the century, it has passed through various owners, all faded with bankruptcy, Mafia murders and scandals. The present time of the story is the first year in many that the account books aren't closed in read ink. And Jake has to keep the integrity of the place during the long winter. It's the oportunity he asked for. Now he's got time for his family and his script. But...  His son Danny has some special gifts, discovered when he arrives at the Overlook and meets the old black cooker and is told that he has &quot;The shining&quot;. A power to view what other people can't normally see. That usually is something very nice, if you know how to use it in your favor. But that's something hard for a five-year old. And when the powerful forces that hide in the shadows of the Overlook decide to play with your gift, the long and easy winter may turn into a white-snow nightmare.  Stephen King was able to create some very complex characters. Jake is a booze addict with a very hard past relationship with his folks, and his tendence is to loose it with his family. His behavior gets worse when he discovers the history of the Hotel in some newspapers at the basement, and what happened to the last winter caretaker. ! Danny is the central point of the plot. The Overlook uses him to &quot;comunnicate&quot; with the Torrance family, using his shine against him. Danny can see with his eyes all the terrible things that took place in the hotel. Wendy is the powerless wife, sees his husband loose his mind, take it over her son, and has her hands stoped with fear. Her construction is also very complex, even if it's hard to see. She has ger own family problems and loves her husband too much to do something against him. But when it comes to Danny... She transforms into the main character and her actions give road to the continuity of the story. But the most vivid and terrible part of the book is played by the Hotel Overlook... HIMself! Yes, I think that we can make it into a person, for he thinks, decides what to do, has a past background, everything that a real person would have. Because, in fact, he's the personality and the will of Stephen King. He overlooks his entire work, his imaginary Boulder, his characters and his plots. Only a writer like him could imagine the scenes with the grass animals.  &quot;The shining&quot; is a unique piece of writing.

In fact, he has some works that have a tendency to this side, like Christine and IT, which in fact are very good. But to me he's remembered as a great na unbelievable storyteller, of all kinds.  &quot;The stand&quot; is one of those stories, with the difference that what happens in the book could turn out reality. The plague that infests the world is like a judgement day. Few people are immune to the disease. Only that they can be good people or Bad people. Although it's over a thousand pages of book, it's not tiring, like Clancy's &quot;Executive Orders&quot;. The story flows with the narrative, and you keep wanting to know what's going to take place next.  The first part tells what happens to the world when the plague hits, the loneliness and sense of loss of the people spared, the impossibility of using all the modern advantages discovered by humanity simply because there's no one to run a power plant. In this part there's a lot os subplots that in the end get together. The only problem is that King divides the characters in Good or Evil, nothing in between, and, let's agree on that, the world never was, is, or is going to be like this, plague or no plague. The good people get around an old black country woman named Mother Abagail, and the bad people get around The Walking Dude, The Dark Man, The Thin Man, The Very and Last Randall Flagg, whom also played an  important part in &quot;Eyes of the dragon&quot; and &quot;The dark tower&quot;.  The thing is that Flagg is much more fun than Mother Abagail. I think that King sensed that while writing the story, and made everyone around Flagg so boring and funless while M. Abagail's folks were happy and full of life, so you don't blame yourself for cheering up for the good guys.  But the book itself is a masterpiece, that should be read for everybody looking for a good and enjoyable work. I think that King's!  mind should be studied.

Thus, &quot;The Flanders panel&quot; seemed irresistible. But once you get to read the book, it's not so much. I mean, I've read better stuff. Okay, the plot is very interesting: suddenly, a murder that took place five centuries ago comes to light again when a pretty woman whose job is to make old paintings look like they were brand new. She discovers a hidden inscription in a flamish painting with na enigmatic question about who would have killed the knight in the portrait. The chess part gets in because the refered knight and another high born noble of the time are playing the game, under the auspicious look of some very looked-for lady.  Reaching the answer of who might be the killer, solving a mistery of half a millenium, the painting would double the given price in na auction. To achieve this, the pretty Julia and her gay friend, who in fact is na art-dealer ( my, what a lucky day! ), contact Julia's ex-lover and teatcher Alvaro. The things star to get bad when Alvaro is murdered. Then, to reconstruct the chess game using some kind of retroactive thinking, they call chess-fanatic Mu&ntilde;oz to help them. Along with the continuing murders, they have to deal with the auction house, who is interested in getting the royalties of the painting from Menchu, Julia's friend and owner of na art gallery. Besides, there are the family who in fact are the right owners of the oil. Other characters appear before the reader, such as Menchu's badboy lover, allways looking for easy money and some misterious blonde woman in a yellow overall ( Jesus! ). But of the three main characters, only one is interesting: the chess player Mu&ntilde;oz. It's really nice to watch him become another person completely different when confronted with a chessboard, loosing the boring face he wears through his entire life. Julia is the common pretty face that makes everybody look at her as na object na not a person; and her friend, th! e gay one, is completely out of fashion nowadays.

With the help osf Amazon, I chose this one, &quot;The Bourne Identity&quot;, because I liked the synopsis, the customer comments, but mostly because it was part of a trilogy. Trilogies enable the writer to deeply develop their characters and plots, explaining in one book what was left behind in another.  At first I couldn't believe what I was reading. It made me feel bad, and I couldn't reason why. Only  when I was in the 100th page I figured out: I hadn't breathen since the beginning. It's incredible how Ludlum keeps a F-1 pace to his story. When you think that he's gonna stop and let you rest, he increases the rythim again.  &quot;The Bourne identity&quot; is the story of a man that could be anyone: me, you, a friend of yours. You simply don't know who Jason Bourne is, because even himself can't remember. That's what's cool about the plot. The reader makes the discoveries together with the main character, dodging bullets, escaping from the unknown enemy, traveling along Switzerland, France and United States. All this with the help of beautiful Marie St. Jacques, a woman that sees herself drowning in another person's nightmare.  Ludlum writes in na universe peopled with evil bank managers, above-government agencies, cold-blooded murderers, just like Forsythe. And in the meantime he still finds time to be funny. Really, there are some true pieces od comedy in the book.  All in all a fantastic read, mostly the first hundred pages. I only hope that the sequel is as good as the first one. I'm gonna buy &quot;The Bourne Supremacy&quot;, and hope to find that Ludlum could keep his good writing.	1998-07-11

Arriving at Jerusalem, Hopeman sees himself pressed by people representing the three religions, that view possession of the diamond as a way to get better over the other two.

The plot in the book is very interesting, but the only problem with Noah Gordon's books is that they get pale if compared to his masterpiece, &quot;The physician&quot;. In &quot;Jerusalem diamond&quot;, the historical chapters seem a little bit undeveloped, and the main plot twists so much that sometimes the reader gets lost. Anyway, a fast book to read, and very pleasant. One won't regret the purchase.	1998-07-04
US	52599570	R1YTSD6M3TS5QM	0345402871	684823314	Airframe	Books	2	1	3	N	N	Unbelievable	In &quot;Airframe&quot;, Michael Crichton did an unbelievable work. I mean, nobody that has ever read his previous books can believe this one comes from the same mind of &quot;Sphere&quot; and &quot;Jurasic park&quot;. By the way, his new books are so passable that his old ones are gettin the public and midia's attention. &quot;Sphere&quot; and &quot;Eaters of the dead&quot; are being or have already been taken into movies. After great &quot;Rising Sun&quot; and &quot;Jurasic...&quot;, Crichton couldn't keep the pace. &quot;Lost world&quot; is very numbing and &quot;Airframe&quot; is tottaly waste of time and patience.  The main plot of the book is, however, good: what could have happened to TransPacific flight, leaving several people injured and some dead? Crichton carries de reader through the hangars of a frame-making company on the edge of bankruptcy, which must solve the mistery quickly so not to loose a big deal that could make money flow on the registers again.  There're so many characters in the plot that even the main one is took aside. Another problem are the infinite number of CCAs, WWCFs and FDAs that take away the good mood from everyone. And when the whole mistery is solved, the accident's motive is so imbecil that you want to throw the book in the fire and watch if it burns.  The writing is boring. The will to leave the book alone is huge, but the reader keeps it in his hands, remembering the money invested in the book and thinking that afterall this is a Crichton book, there must be some kind of surprise at the end.  Believe this reviewer, there isn't.	1998-03-03
