This is probably the tenth Max Brand paperback I have read, and I must say he definitely has written better novels.  The storyline drags.  The two main characters, Joe Warder and Dennis MacMore, continuely escape unscathed via highly unlikely circumstances.  Max Brand's fantasy is again interlaced in this western, portrayed by Arturo -- the tall, thin man dressed in black with a lean, ugly, long face -- showing up at opportune times with his prophecies. After reading the novel completely through, I reread the first 50 pages and gained a little more appreciation of the paperback.  However, if one is looking for reading entertainment, this is not the novel to choose.	2003-12-13

This particular Silvertip novel of Max Brand's is actually a metaphorical fantasy.  The horses talk and philosophize about Man.

If a reader is looking to appreciate Brand's talented method of analyzing Man and his idiosyncrasies, then this paperback will fill that quest.	2003-10-26

Clung, the main character, is an orphaned white male raised by an adoptive Chinese father.  \\"Ghost Rider\\" is the story of Clung's efforts to find his niche in the white man's world, as well as in the Oriental way of living.  Max Brand, the author, not only develops excellent characterization of Clung and his adoptive father, but also of Winifred Sampson, the financier's daughter, whose goal was to help Clung find his niche.  The human shortfalls of greed and manipulation are evidenced by the financier, John Sampson, and his enterprising cohort, William Kirk.  The paperback is an entertaining read.  It may not be one of the best novels you ever read, but definitely is not a waste of your time.	2003-06-06

I was expecting L'Amour novel events to be more plausible.  At times, a better description of some of Kilrone's feats would probably be defined as ludicrous.  Kilrone during the fort siege jumped astride a gray horse bareback.  I found it odd that Kilrone later during that same day on the ride away from the fort, he reaches for the pommel, without mention of ever finding a saddle along the way.  The ending to the novel was very rushed -- absolutely nothing flowed well.  If anyone is considering a L'Amour book to read, maybe it is best he/she chooses another.	2003-05-31

Brand narrated the story in a very meaningful manner in White Wolf's relationship with his foster parent, Mother Wolf.  This was the fifth Max Brand book I have read, but it won't be my last.  \\"The White Wolf\\" is probably not one of Brand's best works, but is definitely worth your time in reading.	2003-05-17

The book is a philosophical fantasy filled with characterization of metaphors, involving the basic struggle of Good versus Evil.  Max Brand, the author, just chose to use a somewhat western setting to this story of fantasy.  To enjoy the book, a reader certainly has to have full appreciation of the various analogies used by the author.  As for entertainment, I really enjoyed Chapter 23 in which Chip Lander describes his excitement for the newest female to move into Happy Valley.  Overall, reading the novel is certainly not a waste of time.	2003-04-21

If \\"Rescue of Broken Arrow\\" had been my first, it might have been my only.  The storyline moved extremely slow.  The author's use of flowery prose seemed a little out-of-place for a true western (i.e., \\"Then the green of the woods closed over them, joining above their heads in green Gothic vaults, crossed with lierne and ogive faintly open to the sprinkling of bright stars above them.\\")  The only plus I saw regarding this particular western was that the author did an excellent job of noting the transformation of the main character, Cashel, from a young eastern renegade thief maturing into a man who finds his niche in life.	2003-03-09

The tidbits of history scattered through the story were interesting (i.e, Jim's reminiscing his service under General Sherman, and Sheriff Luke Tabor being asked to work for the Pinkleton Detective Agency).
