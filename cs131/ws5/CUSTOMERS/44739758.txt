But reader beware, its unlikely you will be satisfied with the direction the story takes them.  Even jaded as I am, I was deeply disturbed by the action described.  As some books are a 'good read', this is a 'bad read', not due to poor writing but because of the unpleasant events depicted.  I compare this book to the awful 'Hannibal' in the graphic torture described, and although  Afterburn is the far better crafted book, I'm still sorry I read it and cannot recommend.	2002-03-08

When I began, I didn't realize that this story was written for pre-adult audiences.  That accounts for the fact that the savage violence occuring all around is only alluded to, never described realistically (...).  While such restraint is entirely appropriate for younger readers, I cannot imagine that the slow pace and off-stage action prove very satisfying to the target audience.  The story itself is a post-apocalyptic take on Alice Through the Looking Glass/Dorothy in Oz searching for a way home, but without any of the humor, whimsey or enchantment of those models.  The premise is intriguing but a much lighter touch is needed to entertain young readers, either that or a much harder edge for adults.	2001-12-04

Carr drops a horrific mystery thriller onto the olde-tyme sidewalks of New York with generally intriguing results.  Like the author's previous THE ALIENIST, cameos by famous historical figures (Teddy Roosevelt, Clarence Darrow) prove fun, if unnecessary to the plot.  But I submit this review to highlight the above referenced recorded version which is exceptional in two respects.  First, reader Boyd Gaines is outstanding delivering a dizzying palette of accents, ages and genders from the turn-of-the-century NYC melting pot.  Pay special attention as he deftly presents the trial testimony of an emotionally-disturbed young girl under cross-examination by Clarence Darrow.  Second, the audio version has been edited in a manner which I've long-advocated, but which is rarely employed.  All the extraneous dialog labeling, (&quot;HE SAID EXCITEDLY&quot;, &quot;SHE REPLIED KNOWINGLY&quot;) has been eliminated leaving a performed play rather than a rote reading.  This approach requires a talented storyteller to keep the characters identifible and convincing.  When it is done well, as here, it demonstrates that the ancient artform of storytelling can be effective in a mass media format.  And Carr's wordy &quot;script&quot; lends itself to this approach. I did not read the written book but my strong impression is that this audio performance only inproves the story.	2001-10-29

Alright, alright, Crichton is no Twain, but still I can see no excuse for issuing this shameless screenplay as a novel.

In this Cold War curiosity, the Catholic cardinal of a Russian puppet state must balance the forces of the secret police on the one hand and the &quot;patriotic clergy&quot; on the other, while struggling to maintain his own link with God. The character study of the hero is strong enough that the reader may be carried well into the tale before realizing that nothing much actually happens.

Not a home run - let's call it a ground rule double.  There are some terrific characters here delivering astonishing, if sometimes too windy, dialog.  On the other hand the author stumbles because of his apparent infatuation with two areas: computers and brain research.  The protagonist's cutesy penchant for describing all action and motivation in computerese is at first merely annoying but eventually undermines the appeal and credibility of the character.  Even real life geeks who obsess about computers don't talk this way about everything else.  Secondly, the whole detour into neuro-research and brain manipulation could have been left out to good effect.  The author seems much enamored of this topic, whether in admiration or in fear, but as presented here it inspires neither and only slows what could have been a crackling good legal novel.<br />Reader Richard Guidall has a field day with the off-beat characters, delivering a first rate performance.

Very important stuff historically, socially and emotionally.

I am a Colin Powell admirer but a definitive biography would better be told by a skilled independent writer, and after more &quot;chapters&quot; in his life are complete.  Powell may indeed be a man of few faults but we can't be sure of that from his own words.  I disagree however with reviewers who postulate that Powell has puffed-up his own accomplishments, on the contrary he's excessively modest.  Rising to the highest position in the most powerful military in world history (and now to US Sec. of State) without benefit of a West Point education &amp; connections describes a truly extraordinary individual.  And far from savaging his detractors and the many incompetants he must have encountered along the way, Powell offers only a few token, and generally mild, criticisms.  This book displays insight into Powell's background, development and beliefs but sidesteps tough questions of who screwed up and when.  In that sense it is highly Politic - burns no bridges - and gives one hope that Powell may yet consider an Eisenhower-like leap to the highest civilian office.	2001-03-31
