One half of the book is a serious technology assessment of early 1970's Portapak technology (a portable video camera combined with a separate portable video tape recorder).  The other half of the book discusses how Portapaks can be used in guerrilla (informal street) theatre.  The book's theme is 'Portapak technology is a powerful, enabling and fun technology with a future'.  Subsequent Portapak development and miniaturization have proven Michael Shamberg correct.<br />The guerrilla theatre discussion is unique for 1973.  Video frames, photographs and line drawings are sprinkled throughout the text -- common in today's multimedia presentations.  IMO the discussion's tone resembles the writings of Abbie Hoffman.<br />A copy of Michael Shamberg's University transcript is included within &quot;Guerrilla Television&quot;.  Michael Shamberg attended the same University that I attended before my arrival (presumably at the same time that Harold Ramis attended my University).  I have heard that Michael Shamberg later became a Hollywood producer.	2004-02-15

Elizabeth was an able administrator, but she is known instead for her brutal and mechanical fascination with depravity and torture.  Elizabeth's obsession with youth caused her to torture and murder 650 indentured maidservants at her castle, often bathing in their blood to restore her own youthfulness.<br />&quot;The Blood Countess ...&quot; also is the fictional interwoven story of Drake Bathory-Kereshtur, a journalist and direct descendent of Elizabeth who fled to the United States during the Hungarian Revolution of 1956.  During his return visit to Hungary after the fall of Communism, Drake becomes involved in a coup attempt to reinstate the hereditary Hungarian monarchy, and with his acquaintances Drake becomes entangled in Elizabeth Bathory's depraved heritage.<br />Andre Codrescu's descriptions of depravity are troubling despite the current popularity of macabre entertainment (of which &quot;Buffy The Vampire Slayer&quot; is the tip of the iceberg).  Yet Andre Codrescu is a craftsman and a wordsmith, and his own experiences with (gothic) Romanian culture are reflected throughout this fictional novel.  Codrescu's descriptions of depravity create an atmosphere of hopelessness that reminds me of &quot;The Gulag Archipelago&quot; by Aleksandr I. Solzhenitsyn.  IMO this wonderful portrayal of hopelessness elevates &quot;The Blood Countess: A Novel&quot; from a good read to a brutal work of art.	2004-01-26

Lovecraft in his Cthulhu Mythos.  Author Ed Simon has extended this mythos in the &quot;Necronomicon&quot;, the testimony of the so-called 'Mad Arab' (a follower of the Sumerian beneficient Elder Gods) and a magickal handbook for sorcerers battling followers of the Sumerian Ancient Ones, the bearers of Chaos.  Simon describes how the Sumerian Ancient Ones were defeated and were banished beyond The Gates, where they wait and scheme to reenter the world.  The Gates are sealed with fifty spells, each spell named and explained in the &quot;Necronomicon&quot;.  The Ancient Ones' followers strive to free the Ancient Ones as they bedevil the Mad Arab, a torment described in the &quot;Necronomicon&quot;.<br />The &quot;Necronomicon&quot; presents a system of magick.  In its introductions the &quot;Necronomicon&quot; references both Aleister Crowley [e.g., &quot;MAGICK in Theory and Practice&quot; (ASIN 1555217664)] and the Christian New Testament's &quot;Book of Revelations&quot; -- I prefer these referenced works as _literature_.  But the system of magick that the &quot;Necronomicon&quot; describes is said to have originated in the Eighth Century A.D.

Mr. Hassan was a Moonie for over two years, during which time he rose from recruit to Unification Church Manhattan NY main lecturer and Unification Church national headquarters assistant director.  Then Mr. Hassan's family had him 'forcibly deprogrammed' while he was convalescing from a bad automobile accident.  After much emotional resistance Mr. Hassan's Unification Church belief faltered and he regained the rational detachment required to view his experiences objectively.  Mr. Hassan grew to despise the abusive mind control techniques he had *experienced and used* as a Unification Church member and leader -- he now describes the Unification Church as a 'destructive cult'.  Mr. Hassan returned to college to study psychology, then developed his own 'exit counseling' techniques that rely on discussion rather than anxiety-creating confrontation to break a destructive cult's hold upon its members.<br />Mr. Hassan's powerfully-written text first describes his experience as a destructive cult's member and leader, then describes his extensive experience as an exit counselor helping members of many destructive cults.  Mr. Hassan describes how destructive cults attract, recruit, isolate and control their members, rewarding attitudes and behaviors approved by cult leaders and punishing attitudes and behaviors not approved by cult leaders.  Cult members' lives revolve around this programmed reward and punishment, an environment that quickly confuses and forces cult members into obedience.<br />\\"Combatting CULT MIND CONTROL\\" is suitable both for social workers getting their first exposure to destructive cults, and also for concerned family members trying to understand what their loved one is experiencing as a cult member.<br />Since Mr. Hassan's text was written in 1990 the United States domestic economy and tax revenues have shrunk significantly -- the 'social safety net' has frayed while sexually transmitted diseases have spread.  At the same time un(der)employment has broken many lower- and middle-class families' marriages and credit resources.

Cults use motivational psychology to create closed controlling environments where cult members have little opportunity for free thinking.  Societal organizations such as the advertising and sales industries, schools, and governmental organizations also use motivational psychology, but these organizations exert less control over members' lives.  Some cults control *all* aspects of their members' lives, including where members work and live, members' social companions, members' sexual companions (if any), and even when members can use the bathroom.  Cults achieve complete control through a program of deliberate isolation plus psychological reward and punishment.  Cult members mechanically serve the cult leadership's goals and fantasies, often accumulating money, wealth and power for the cult leadership.<br />Professor Singer is a psychologist with over fifty years of research and clinical experience, and her collaborator Janja Lalich is a former cult member.  Together they have produced a well-written text describing 'What Are Cults' and 'How Do They Work'.  This very readable text is filled with specific examples describing how cults affect their membership, and examples describing the obstacles that former cult members face if they return to overall society.  The discussion describes the use and effects of extreme motivational psychology within cults.  The discussion also assists understanding motivational psychology use and effects within overall society.<br />\\"Cults In Our Midst: ...\\" was written in 1995.  Since 1995 the United States' sexual mores (reflected by the entertainment media) have liberalized, sexually transmitted disease has increased, and societal affluence has lessened.  If this text was revised in 2003, I believe that additional discussion of (lack of, or unconventional) sexuality and (lack of) food as motivators and punishment would be warranted.	2003-04-12

Charles and Caroline Muir conduct Tantric vacation seminars in Hawaii.  \\"Tantra ...\\" does not concentrate upon (Western) neo-Tantric mechanics -- \\"Tantra ...\\" is *not* a 'how-to' manual.  Rather, \\"Tantra ...\\" concentrates upon a couple's interpersonal and sexual relationship, encouraging both partners 'to play by the same rules' using effective communication and shared intimacy to protect and preserve their mutual investment in each other.  The Muirs acknowledge that their approach might not save a spoiled relationship, but their approach might prevent a fresh relationship from spoiling.<br />\\"Tantra ...\\" is a textual overview of neo-Tantric sexuality that emphasizes sexual love between equal caring partners.  The Muirs summarize neo-Tantric sexuality in a well-written, positive and optimistic manner, but provide no accompanying diagrams.  Male ejaculatory control is discussed extensively -- in my opinion the discussed male ejaculatory control methods are *not* reliable, potentially are *very* painful, and *never* should be used as a contraception technique.  The Muirs do not discuss 'safe words' -- easily remembered words or phrases signifying 'disengage immediately'.  And the Muirs neglect to discuss birth control and 'safe sex' -- serious omissions in *any* discussion of human sexuality.<br />I believe that \\"Tantra: The Art of Conscious Loving\\" is most valuable for new partners in a fresh relationship without entrenched bad habits and attitudes.  I recommend \\"The Art of Sexual Ecstasy: The Path of Sacred Sexuality for Western Lovers\\" by Margo Anand as a follow-on text for readers wishing detailed neo-Tantric information.	2003-03-15

Unlike the Dan Ackroyd / Rosie O'Donnell film adaptation, Ms. Rice's novel is elegant pornography.  \\"Exit to Eden\\" describes The Club, a Caribbean island resort where members can experience their sexual fantasies in a safe and luxurious setting.  \\"Exit to Eden\\" is the story of Lisa, the boss lady slave trainer known as 'The Perfectionist'; and the story of Elliot, a free-lance photographer who contracts as a sexual slave.<br />The Club is exclusive -- members are prescreened and purchase expensive annual memberships.  The Club's trainers visit invitation-only global auctions where experienced adult sexual slaves offer themselves for hire.  Club trainers bid on the best slaves, and slaves typically sign a two-year $100,000 personal services employment contract.  [Serious omissions: No discussion of safe sex precautions, safe words or pierced jewelry.  No discussion of penalties for serious discipline breaches -- e.g., monetary fines or unpaid contract extensions.]  Slaves are transported belowdecks on the Club yacht to begin their Club training.  Trained slaves are dominant or submissive according to Club members' wishes.<br />Ms. Rice's novel describes BDSM elegantly and should appeal especially to women who fantasize about sexually dominating men.  Ms. Rice's novel also provides psychological insights into conditioning humans for submission.  I believe these psychological insights give \\"Exit to Eden\\" value beyond mere pornographic entertainment.	2003-02-17

Riley and Melanie are not affluent, but their lifestyle is happy and free.<br />Walking his dog Halloween evening Riley secretly observes a ritual murder performed in an abandoned church.  The next morning Riley returns to the church and finds a cauldron containing burnt chicken bones, a bloodstained floor, a partially burnt Bible, and a ceremonial knife.  Riley removes the Bible and the knife.  Riley later returns to the church with the police -- all ritual evidence is gone.  The police are skeptical and Riley does not mention the Bible or the knife.<br />Shortly thereafter the voluptuous Leeanah Thorndyke visits Riley's cottage.  Leeanah requests that Riley and Melanie return the Bible and knife, and Leeanah later sends Sebastian Synn's Rolls Royce to convey Riley and Melanie to Sebastian's mansion for the exchange.

The world blunders into nuclear war: the Soviets perceive United States weakness, contact between opposing forces escalates, the Soviets launch a nuclear strike and the United States retaliates.<br />Post-cataclysmic survival is more interesting than the brief nuclear war.  After the Bomb, paper money and electronic transactions *immediately* become worthless and *all* debt payments are suspended by Government.  Deliveries of energy and commodities cease, gas pumps and store shelves soon are empty, then electricity ceases.  Residents rely on wood heat for cooking and heating, and rely on leftover home heating oil for lantern fuel.  A barter-based economy develops, liquor becomes a precious disinfectant and anesthetic, and some volunteer to share housing.  Fort Repose's rural Florida location solves some problems: artesian wells provide running water without electric pumps; the river provides clean fish; the mild Florida winter is non-threatening with burnable wood located nearby; a small town's familiarity discourages wanton looting; and Fort Repose has a dedicated physician/surgeon.  Shelter and food are the only issues -- nobody cares about politics or who won the war.<br />\\"Alas, Babylon\\" is relevant today.  When deliveries cease, Fort Repose society evolves to accomodate shortages.  Today's higher energy costs are forcing up *all* costs and creating affordability-based shortages.  United States society is evolving to function in a era of shortages.	2003-02-13

Stockman served as Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) during former President Reagan's first term.  President Reagan's platform advocated cutting taxes, eliminating wasteful Government programs, balancing the Federal budget by 1984, and a stronger United States military.<br />Congressmen, Senators, lobbyists and President Reagan's staff members all had differing priorities.  In \\"The Triumph of Politics: ...\\" Mr. Stockman discusses an endless stream of strategies and legislative compromises designed to implement President Reagan's platform.  Tax cuts are passed, existing programs are cut, and the military is strengthened.  But the Federal budget never is balanced because tax increases were forbidden and the compromises placed off-limits many expensive Government programs.<br />The result is troubling.  Former President Carter's proposed 1986 budget would have included an $80 billion deficit (pg. 358).  In April 1983 President Reagan's budget \\"guaranteed $200 billion per year of deficits for the foreseeable future\\" (pg. 370) that will \\"consume two-thirds of the nation's net private savings to fund the federal deficit\\" (pg. 378) and require \\"$100 billion per year inflow of foreign capital to finance our twin deficits -- trade and the federal budget.\\" (pg. 379).  Mr. Stockman believed this huge recurring deficit was not sustainable and that compensating tax increases were not politically acceptable.  Mr. Stockman left Government after President Reagan's re-election.<br />Today we face similar issues.  Our trade and Federal deficits continue to grow, a Federal income tax cut was implemented recently, and the United States military is being strengthened.  These are similarities -- what is the difference?  ***Capitalization.***  In President Reagan's time, economists discussed the possibility of returning to the 'gold standard' (pg. 50) -- tying the dollar's value to the Government's precious metal holdings.

He served in the United States Army, as an Assistant District Attorney, in the Federal Bureau of Investigation and in the Treasury Department.  In private life he practiced law and served as Counsel for former President Nixon's 'Committee to Re-elect The President'.  During the re-election campaign he organized and participated in the Democratic National Committee Watergate Headquarters break-in, was caught, was convicted and was sentenced to twenty years' imprisonment.  Liddy's refusal to cooperate with the Watergate investigation and subsequent impeachment hearings earned Liddy punishing assignment to the worst Federal prisons.  Liddy never cooperated.  In 1977 former President Carter commuted Liddy's sentence to eight years and Liddy was released after serving fifty-two months.<br />Liddy wrote &quot;Will: The Autobiography of G. Gordon Liddy&quot; long after all other affected parties had told everything.  Liddy's premise in &quot;Will: ...&quot; is the self-conquest of human fear and human weakness, molding oneself into the perfect soldier.  His crusade began during his sickly childhood, continued through his Army, Government and private careers, and sustained him through Federal prison.<br />Liddy describes his experiences candidly, clearly and well.  He views humanity with cynicism born from long experience.  Liddy's crusade to mold himself into a perfect soldier, his actions and his attitudes are *extremely* controversial, yet Liddy is an *extremely* intelligent man whose life molded his attitudes.<br />I recommend &quot;Will: The Autobiography of G.

Dr. Reich brought his workers' agenda to Washington at a time when the poor and middle class had lost employment and real income for two decades.  During his four years as Labor Secretary, Dr. Reich increasingly saw his workers' agenda tabled as other, more powerful constituencies (e.g., Wall Street and the military) got priority.  Dr. Reich did not achieve his workers' agenda -- his agenda remains tabled today.<br />Dr. Reich is an *extremely* intelligent man and an able author.  \\"Locked ...\\" is his story told with a sharp and depreciating wit.  Dr. Reich's strong wit occasionally obscures his message: Continuity of Government is each Administration's goal and everybody must support the Administration, yet politics hinders 'team play' by dissecting, analyzing and criticizing *every utterance*.  One day you are 'locked in'.  If something happens the next day you are 'locked out'.<br />I believe that after his resignation Dr. Reich wrote \\"Locked In The Cabinet\\" to place his experiences in perspective.

I believe that witchcraft is goal-oriented magick-use with *no* moral and *no* ethical constraints. I do *not* equate witchcraft to Wicca.<br />Mr. Huson begins by attributing magick to the Nephilim, the children of the \\"sons of God\\" (Genesis 6:4, also called daemons or fallen angels) who mated with the daughters of man. The Nephilim exist in other cultures' histories -- e.g., the Norse Giants and the Greek Titans. According to Mr. Huson the Nephilim perished during the Great Flood, but their spirits survived due to their angelic nature. Mr. Huson states that the Nephilim are able to reincarnate and that all magickal knowledge is derived from them.<br />Mr. Huson then discusses magick. His interesting text concentrates on dark magick including gambling with your soul (pg. 6), the legal consequences of intimidation (pp. 28 and 174), poison rings (pg.44), adulterants for food, drink, and cigarettes (pp. 102 and 189), planetary (torment) spells for indifferent or neglectful lovers (pp. 107-111), the Dumb Supper [a silent supper for communing with a dead spouse (and I believe for punishing a separated or divorced spouse)] (pp. 111-115), love dissolution spells (pp. 125 and 189-190), binding the victim's soul or deep mind (pg. 136), mandrake root and devil's weed (pg. 146), the basis of vampire and werewolf legends (pg. 152), banishing (pg. 169), exorcism fumigations (pg. 170), ligature (pp. 179-180), bondage and sensory deprivation [the witch's bridle/cradle (pg. 180) and hoodwinks (pg. 220)], and erection of a psychic booby trap (pg. 185).<br />After two complete readings of this text I believe that \\"Mastering Witchcraft: ...\\" is difficult reading due to its arcane jargon.

Their products are expensive, are sold to a select clientele, and are sold directly at the customer's home.  Mr. Leon, head of Leon Enterprises, enjoys and exercises power.  He personally runs his enterprise with an iron hand and demands cult-like obedience from his employees.  Faithful employees who make the required sacrifices are rewarded with renewed youthfulness, wealth, and privilege.<br />&quot;The Immortals&quot; is interesting because of its youth fixation -- a twentieth century replay of vampirism (customers' sustained youthfulness requires sustained financial drain) and Oscar Wilde's &quot;The Picture of Dorian Gray&quot; (employees' sustained youthfulness requires increasing depravation).  Also, Leon Enterprises *could* be an allegory for organized crime's reputed sales of drugs like ecstasy and cocaine.	2001-08-08

Within Wicca the Goddess (and women's viewpoints) are emphasized over the God (and men's viewpoints).  This female emphasis is evident throughout witchcraft.  Dianic/feminist witches use rituals similar to Wiccan rituals but exclude the God.  In &quot;The Spiral Dance: A Rebirth of the Ancient Religion of the Great Goddess&quot; author Miriam Samos (Starhawk) comments &quot;some women may have difficulty understanding why a feminist would bother with the Horned God at all&quot; (pg. 121).  Ms. Samos' witchcraft Tradition casts the God and men in a weak supporting role.<br />In &quot;Wicca for Men: A Handbook for Male Pagans Seeking a Spiritual Path&quot; (&quot;Wicca for Men&quot;) author A.J. Drew offers a Wiccan Tradition with better female/male balance: the Tradition of Creation's Covenant.  Creation's Covenant honors the Goddess and the God equally, and its rituals provide meaningful roles for women and men both.<br />&quot;Wicca for Men&quot; begins with a *very* readable history of witchcraft and Wicca.  The author discusses Gods and Goddesses, and their human personifications as Son/Father/Sage and Maiden/Mother/Crone.  Mr. Drew discusses Creation Covenant's ethics tradition.  The author discusses ritual tools, building the Wiccan Temple (e.g., the Circle), the Sabbat celebrations, and magick spells in detail.  &quot;Wicca for Men&quot; ends with a partial listing of Creation Covenant's 'Book of Shadows' (BOS).  The BOS includes a ritual allowing One to renounce Western religions and dedicate Oneself to Wicca (pg. 154), and rituals for celebrating each Sabbat.  (The Sabbat rituals leave some details unspoken.  Wicca is a fertility-based religion.)<br />&quot;Wicca for Men&quot; does *not* live up to its title.  There is a real need for a book discussing the *male* viewpoint of witchcraft and Wicca, and &quot;Wicca for Men&quot; does not meet this need.  The book I've encountered best meeting this need is &quot;Wicca: A Guide For The Solitary Practitioner&quot; by Scott Cunningham.  Mr. Cunningham's Wiccan philosophy emphasizes ethics over dogma, and suggests how solitary worshippers can modify Wicca to fit their beliefs.<br />I recommend &quot;Wicca for Men&quot; with reservations.

Heinlein discusses human society as viewed by Valentine Michael Smith, 'The Man From Mars', the first human offspring born on Mars raised by Martians.  Smith travels to Earth as a young man, knows only the Martian language, has never seen women, and is totally naive.  But Smith brings to Earth the disciplines embodied in the Martian language.  These disciplines control all physical and mental functions including the power to teleport the body, to astrally project the mind, and to discorporate (cease to exist) objects both animate and inanimate.<br />The first twenty-eight chapters of &quot;Stranger ...&quot; describe the planet Mars, Smith learning about humans and sexuality, and Smith making human friends ('growing closer').  Mars is an arid, resource-poor environment.  Young Martian 'nymphs' are females that mature to become adult males.  Smith makes his first human friends through the Martian 'sharing water' ritual.  Sexual lovemaking later supplants sharing water as his growing closer ritual.<br />The next seven chapters of &quot;Stranger ...&quot; deal with Smith's career first as a carnival performer and then as an evangelist.  As a carnival performer Smith learns skeptism for human behavior and motivation.  Smith then decides to improve humanity by teaching the Martian language and its attendent disciplines.  He founds a church whose members, once chosen, advance in rank according to their Martian language proficiency and their closeness to other church members.<br />Chapter XXXVI raises (but doesn't discuss) a number of issues relevent today.  Smith uses reincarnation belief to justify himself choosing and discorporating ~450 'vicious' individuals [consider vigilantes].  He utilizes unrestricted lovemaking to promote closeness among church members [consider sexually transmitted diseases and rejection of 'safe sex' practices].  He does not value human infants because Martian nymphs must survive unaided [consider unwanted children].  And Smith challenges the sanctity of property and asks why human adults do not voluntarily discorporate (euthanize) to provide food (resources) for others [consider the medical ethics of withholding or withdrawing life support to conserve a patient's estate value].<br />Despite having won the 1962 Hugo Award I believe that &quot;Stranger In A Strange Land&quot; is written awkwardly.  The first thirty-five chapters form a wordy tale that does not achieve its potential -- rather than discussing Smith these chapters discuss the characters around Smith.  Yet &quot;Stranger ...&quot; is important for its sociological concepts.  Several 1960's organizations based upon these concepts have adapted and survive today.must survive unaided [consider unwanted children].

Ray Bradbury's &quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot; describes a society where knowledge is controlled by book-burning 'firemen'.  This government-implemented censorship starts as 'political correctness' -- upset people deface controversial books.  Then government decides to pacify society by simplifying education and eliminating books.  Noncontroversial interactive televised plays replace books as entertainment, neighbors inform on neighbors possessing books, and firemen incinerate houses containing books.<br />Guy Montag, a fireman, meets a young woman who chides him for living but not experiencing life.  Guy examines his life.  His relationship with his wife Mildred is remote and cold -- they have nothing in common.  (Mildred spends *all* of her time in the 'living room', a room with an interactive television screen covering each of three walls.  Mildred sleeps in a separate bed with 'seashell' radio earpieces in her ears.)  During one firecall Guy observes a homeowner herself light the firemen's kerosene and then perish in the flames -- Guy cannot understand the woman's protest.  And upon reflection Guy cannot understand why books must be burnt.  His attitude alienates his fellow firemen, who threaten and then arrest him.  Guy escapes and seeks refuge in the countryside.<br />&quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot; somewhat resembles Aldous Huxley's &quot;Brave New World&quot; and George Orwell's &quot;1984&quot;.  &quot;Brave New World&quot; uses eugenic control and the drug 'soma' to pacify society.  &quot;1984&quot; uses ever-present surveillance, propaganda and torture to pacify society.  &quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot; simplifies education and bans books (i.e., eliminates controversial thinking and discussion), substitutes interactive television (e.g., video games and the Internet), and portrays neighbors as informants to be avoided -- everyone is isolated in their home.  The &quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot; societal portrayal seems less sinister, but it is easier to implement and therefore more dangerous.<br />There *are* many similarities between &quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot; society and today's United States urban society.  And &quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot; is a beautifully-written book suitable to read aloud.  I highly recommend this book.more dangerous.<br />There *are* many similarities between &quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot; society and today's United States urban society.

In &quot;1984&quot; a perpetual state of war exists both to enslave productive populations and also to justify total behavioral control over society.  Orwell structures his society using Karl Marx's Communist model: 'Proles' (proletariat), large 'Outer Party', and small 'Inner Party'.  The Proles are a poor, marginally-educated workforce requiring minimal control -- they are happy with their ale.  The Outer Party is the educated workforce that implements routine governmental functions.  To enforce their submissive behavior they are spied upon by telescreens, by coworkers, and by family members.  Outer Party members are poor but Victory Gin is inexpensive.  Well-paid Inner Party members ensure total societal submission to authority using government policies, surveillance, propaganda, trickery and torture.  The Inner Party's total behavioral control over others also intimidates potential Inner Party rebels into total submission.<br />&quot;1984&quot; does not contain mobile computer terminals and computerized databases.  It does contain 'telescreens': two-way video/audio devices that permit propaganda broadcasts and also allow video/audio surveillance.  The telescreens *cannot* be turned off and blocking them is treasonable.  Other societal control programs include 'Thought Police' patrols, alteration of all records, and a language simplification program designed both to hinder 'thoughtcrimes' and also to eliminate the critical questions that well-educated people ask.<br />George Orwell did not anticipate computers, but he understood Karl Marx's strategem for controlling society using economics, surveillance, propaganda, and the educational system.  &quot;1984&quot; reflects this understanding.	2001-03-21

In &quot;Walden Two&quot; (a fictional work) B. F. Skinner describes his utopian community vision.  &quot;Walden Two&quot; concentrates on behavioral psychology but neglects questions concerning family values and community finances.<br />Walden Two's lifestyle maximizes leisure time, but it does not build strong families.  Family members live separately: spouses in adjoining rooms; older children in dormitories; and babies in shared infant-care facilities.  Members eat in shared dining rooms with young children in different dining rooms.  Teenagers are encouraged to marry in their late teens -- these young marrieds are encouraged to move to Walden Two's sister communities.  Walden Two has a stated policy of supporting its senior citizens, but few members have reached senior citizen age.<br />Walden Two is governed by its religion: &quot;The Code&quot;.  The Code is a set of behavioral rules that encourages pleasantry.  When members have difficulty following The Code they are encouraged to consult Walden Two's &quot;psychologist-priests&quot;.  Other members (including members' own spouses and children) pressure uncooperative Walden Two members to conform.  A member facing an unresolved dilemma has potential family problems and has little external recourse.  Senior citizens face their special problems with few family members to assist them.<br />B. F. Skinner's discussion of Walden Two's finances is weak.  The author does not discuss who supplies the large amounts of money required to purchase the land, the capital equipment, and to feed and house people during the construction of Walden Two and its sister communities.  The author also does not dwell on the *impact* of leaving Walden Two.  Members leave Walden Two with the possessions they brought to Walden Two -- little to show for their many years' work.  Children leave Walden Two with the clothing on their backs -- their families have few resources to help them.  And Walden Two has not yet faced the financial and labor cost of supporting a significant number of senior citizen members.<br />I believe that &quot;Walden Two&quot; is *not* a humanistic utopian community design.  The forced comformance with The Code, the disassociation of family members from birth through middle age, the financial penalties for leaving, and senior citizens' potential separation from family makes &quot;Walden Two&quot; resemble a pleasant version of George Orwell's &quot;1984&quot;.  I would *not* want to live in Walden Two.<br />Finally, I found the author's writing style pedantic.  I do *not* recommend this book.urces to help them.

In his second book, Governor Janos<br />describes his experiences as Governor.  He also discusses problems<br />facing Minnesota and the United States, and his decision to leave the<br />National Reform Party.<br />Governor Janos' won his Governorship as the<br />Reform Party candidate, the highest electoral victory won by that<br />political party.  Governor Janos' victory resembled that of former<br />President Jimmy Carter, an outsider who won upon a platform of<br />reforming the Federal bureaucracy.  President Carter had limited<br />success reforming the Federal bureaucracy, and he had difficulty with<br />an unfamiliar national news media.<br />Governor Janos describes how he<br />attracted the best people from the Democratic, Republican, and Reform<br />parties to work in his Administration.  His strong tripartisan<br />Administration has permitted Governor Ventura to reduce state debt by<br />&quot;cutting the pork&quot; from Minnesota spending.  This spending<br />reduction makes him unpopular with some Minnesota legislators and<br />their allies in the news media.<br />In nearly half of this book the<br />Governor assumes a new role: educator.  Governor Janos feels that the<br />issues affecting Minnesota and the United States are not discussed<br />openly and fairly.  He discusses these issues plainly and he states<br />his opinions clearly.  This is a *very* strong position.<br />I do not<br />agree with all of Governor Janos' positions.  On page 163, Governor<br />Janos proposes having armed personnel working undercover in schools to<br />prevent events such as the shootings in Columbine Colorado.  I<br />disagree with Governor Janos because I believe that an armed person's<br />first responsibility is to control his firearm.  Armed personnel<br />wearing ankle holsters will get jostled daily, and gossipy students<br />will observe that these individuals are armed.  *If* armed individuals<br />are required in schools, I believe that high visibility, uniformed<br />police officers should bear this responsibility.  I also believe that<br />these officers should be rotated periodically back to regular duty,<br />both to keep them fresh and also to continue their professional<br />advancement.<br />On page 157 Governor Janos states &quot;Drug addiction<br />is a consenual crime, it's a 'crime against oneself.&quot;, and on<br />page 158 Governor Janos proposes decriminalizing drug abuse.  I do<br />*not* believe that drug abuse is merely a &quot;crime against<br />oneself&quot;.  Some recreational drugs (e.g., &quot;speed&quot;)<br />cause violent or paranoid behaviour.  Also, drug abuse financially<br />victimizes society by wasting money that could be used to feed,<br />clothe, house, and educate.

Ms. Samos provides  excellent detail concerning the rituals of her Witchcraft Tradition, and  includes a number of contemporary reference citations.<br />&quot;The Spiral  Dance...&quot; is as much a political manifesto as about Witchcraft.  Ms.  Samos' repeatedly discusses the shortcomings of &quot;patriarchal&quot;  politics and religions, stating that matriarchal religions are more  equitable.  Yet unlike Wicca (where the God and the Goddess are worshiped  equally), the God and men are relegated to a weak supporting role in  &quot;The Ancient Religion of the Great Goddess&quot;.<br />Ms. Samos'  includes 52 pages of her tenth and twentieth anniversary notes in a  separate, appendix-like section.  This arrangement places the notes out of  context.  The notes belong as footnotes within the main text.<br />I recommend  this book.  &quot;The Spiral Dance...&quot; provides detailed insight into  Witchcraft not available in other books.	2000-08-27

Mr. Beck describes his anger  and resentment at white society's treatment of black people.  He describes  his dealings with the Black Panther Party and his admiration for the young  Black Panthers.<br />Mr. Beck dedicated this book to a number of black  luminaries including Malcolm X.  Mr. Beck also mentions Malcolm X.  I  compared this book to &quot;The Autobiography of Malcolm X&quot; by Malcolm  X and Alex Haley (co-author).  Mr. Beck discusses white society's racism  and writes about revolutionary solutions to racism.  Early in his life  Malcolm X also sought revolutionary solutions to racism.  After his visit  to Islamic North Africa, however, Malcolm X proposed a different solution:  a strong, black-owned and black-operated economy coexisting peacefully with  the rest of society.  Mr. Beck does not discuss Malcolm X's later-proposed  solution.<br />This is an interesting book.  It is clearly-written, and Mr.  Beck has led an interesting life.	2000-08-13

Johnny O'Brien's story continues  in &quot;Long White Con&quot;.  Johnny now calls himself Folks.  He has  graduated to the long con.  Long cons are elaborate confidence games that  include casts of rehearsed players plus elaborate sets.  In long cons  wealthy marks are cheated out of large amounts of money.  Folks is older  now; he is an experienced actor and has more self-confidence.<br />&quot;Long  White Con&quot; contains some insight into long con games, but periodically  Mr. Beck uses sexually-explicit material in place of content.  The dialogue  is not excellent and only Folks' character is well-developed.<br />I do not  recommend this book.	2000-08-08

He is light-skinned: &quot;He could have been Errol Flynn's  twin.&quot;  (pg. 9)  Johnny O'Brien's coloration allows him to con white persons  easily.  Darker-skinned blacks shun Johnny O'Brien.  Johnny resents white  people for their prosperity and attitude towards black people, and fears  many black people for the way they treat him.<br />In &quot;PIMP: The Story of  My Life&quot;, Robert Beck (street-named Iceberg Slim) combined excellent  dialogue with vivid descriptions.  Mr. Beck did not duplicate this  achievement in &quot;Trick Baby&quot;.  Here, his dialogues and  descriptions are contrived.  &quot;Trick Baby&quot; describes &quot;the  short con&quot; -- a  confidence game designed to cheat the victim out of  small amounts of money.  The short con is based primarily upon smooth and  convincing dialogue, not upon elaborate sets.  Mr. Beck's  dialogues are so  stiff that it is hard to believe the cons are successful.<br />I do not  recommend this book.	2000-08-04

Pagan tribes and witches' covens celebrate the Sabbats according to local tradition.  It is difficult for novices and solitary practitioners to learn  Sabbat history and rituals.  Ms. McCoy's excellent book fills this  void.<br />The author addresses the Sabbats from a broad pagan perspective.  She discusses the history  of each Sabbat, and relates each Sabbat to  ethnic celebrations held globally.  Ms. McCoy provides both solitary and  group rituals for each Sabbat, and explains each ritual's meaning.  She  describes activities, recipes, and crafts for each Sabbat, and describes  natural items appropriate to each Sabbat's celebration.<br />Ms. McCoy  provides several useful appendices.  Appendix I describes how One can  construct  their own rituals.  Appendix II describes elements of spell  construction.  Appendix III is a *very*  comprehensive glossary which  itself is a valuable reference.  Appendix VI lists items (e.g.,  activities, foods, plants, and symbols) appropriate to each Sabbat.<br />I  recommend this book as a companion volume to Ms. McCoy's excellent  beginner's book &quot;Inside  A Witches' Coven&quot;.

Arkady  Renko, son of an Russian general, is the Chief Police Inspector of the  Moscow Town Prosecutor's office -- a post everyone agrees is beneath him.  Irina Asanova is a film wardrobe assistant who would do anything to leave  the Soviet Union.  J. D. Osborne is an American multimillionaire decorated  by the Soviets for World War II bravery.

The author paints his story in shades of grey -- there are no highlights  for civilians during wartime.  Finding food and shelter while battling  constant fear is exhausting.  Decency is subordinated to staying alive, and  patriotism is a luxury.  Wartime permanently mars survivors.  The attitudes  survivors learn remain with them, and these attitudes affect survivors for  the rest of their lives.<br />This book describes police superintendent  Rosso's investigation of a murder.  The murder was ordered by a successful  gangster, drug smuggler, and profiteer whose gang acts as wartorn  Sarajevo's civilian militia.  A subplot describes an American reporter's  experiences in Sarajevo, and contrasts the reporter's affluent lifestyle  with the lives of those around him.  The Bosnian settling is relevant today  because UN peacekeeping efforts continue in Bosnia today.<br />John Fullerton  has portrayed war's long-lasting hardship within a clearly written and  interesting novel, an impressive accomplishment.	2000-05-26

The soldiers include an Army enlistee who finds a &quot;nine-to-five war&quot; when he arrives  in Vietnam in 1962; an Army drill sergeant who worries that the Army  prevents him from teaching his men the killer instinct; and a Navy SEAL  whose job is terrorism.

Instead they emphasize  the Vietnam War's effect upon men and women soldiers; white and minority  soldiers; and enlisted personnel, officers, and their families.  The  recollections discuss the relationship between the Americans and the  Vietnamese people.  The recollections also discuss the Viet Cong war  philosophy: terrorism and erosion of will.<br />On April 30, 2000 a  copyrighted Reuters news article &quot;Vietnam Celebrates War  Anniversary&quot; reported that Vietnamese &quot;Officials paid glowing  tribute to the three million Vietnamese soldiers and civilians who died  during the war.

It is well-suited for a parent having difficulty: the parent can form a family Coven as an aid to  communication among family  members.  But New Generation Witchcraft is not Wicca.<br />Wicca is a globally  practiced religion that has constants:  worship of the Goddess and the God;  respect for the Earth; and adherence to The Rede, Wicca's &quot;prime  directive&quot;.  There are many  versions of The Rede but all are  analogous to the physician's Hippocratic Oath: &quot;First do no  harm.&quot;<br />Ms. Thayer defines Wicca differently.  On pp. 14-15 she  states [the parentheses are Ms.  Thayer's] &quot;The word 'Wiccan' ...  projects a different set of associations - weaving, church, New Earth,  wicker furniture (don't ask me why) and the movie 'The Wicker Man' (which  although I  despised, I fully understand).  It also means 'front,' a way to  bring the public into accepting our belief system for what it actually is,  not what their preconceived ideas of a word dictates to them.&quot;<br />Ms.  Thayer's book is attractively illustrated, and is clearly written in a  conversational style.  She discusses several popular New Age topics in a  disorganized manner.  Ms. Thayer provides good  details on candles, colors,  crystals, fortune telling, herbs, and starting on page 62 &quot;Self-help  and other mind programming tapes and videos&quot;.  She discusses  meditation and discusses tantra  (opening the chakras), but the discussions  are insufficient to practice these disciplines.  Ms.  Thayer also discusses  several less well-defined New Age subjects: astral projection, healing,  spell casting, and telepathy.<br />Ms. Thayer's book is attractively written  and contains good detail on several New Age topics, but New Generation  Witchcraft is not Wicca.

Huxley writes  with a fine dry humor, but BNW's overall tone is oppressive.<br />There are  similarities between Huxley's BNW and today's society:  eugenically-controlled  population classes versus today's racial classes;  mental control by sleep conditioning versus  today's social conditioning by  music, movies, and television; and soma versus today's drug Ecstasy.  Yet  Huxley's BNW description is incomplete.  BNW lacks an economic basis.  Huxley discusses no BNW societal goals beyond survival of *society*.  Poverty exists in BNW but Huxley presents society from an affluent  viewpoint -- the lives of BNW's poorer members are not chronicled.  And  although BNW was written before the existence of HIV/AIDS, Huxley does not  discuss syphilis and gonorrhea (the sexually transmitted diseases in 1931)  when he presents BNW's sexual freedom without attachment.<br />In &quot;Brave  New World Revisited&quot; (BNWR) Huxley reexamines BNW in terms of society  in 1958.  Here Huxley examines the methods used by Hitler, Stalin and  psychology to mold and control  human minds and behavior.  Huxley predicts  that overpopulation will require excessive control  of individuals in order  to ensure society's existence.  Huxley also predicts that excessive control  will replace individual initiative and freedom with (universally medicated)  compliant mentalities.  Based upon 1958's society, Huxley states that  society *is* unstoppably headed toward the excessively controlled Brave New  World.<br />Huxley's tone within BNWR is pedantic.  Yet given Huxley's  post-World War II viewpoint plus his  belief that society is unstoppably  replacing individual freedom with societal control, writing with a fine dry  wit would have been inappropriate.d have been inappropriate.	2000-04-27

Mr. Collin does *not*  stress music.  Instead, Mr. Collin discusses music as part of  Ecstasy's  effect upon people.<br />Mr. Collin describes Ecstasy as &quot;the euphoric  peak of a lifetime&quot;.  One's first Ecstasy  experiences are strikingly  empathic and stimulating.  Tactile and verbal communication are delightful,  and dancing and music acquire their own lives.  Ecstasy's sensory and  empathic effect  combined with its related clubs, music and dress codes  make it especially attractive to first-time  drug users.<br />With continued  use Ecstasy users lose the initial ecstatic feeling.  To regain the  original ecstatic feeling users first try larger Ecstasy doses.  Within a  year larger Ecstasy doses fail, and users try other drugs (cocaine or  amphetamine-like Ecstasy variants).  Once lost the ecstatic feeling is  gone, but the user now is using hard drugs.  And organized crime often  accompanies hard drug  sales.<br />The chapter &quot;Techno Travellers&quot;  is intriguing because it discusses Ecstasy users' impact upon  English  politics and society.  Groups of working class Ecstasy users (like the  &quot;Merry Pranksters&quot;  documented by Ken Kesey) believed that  occupying public and private property and that providing deafening music  was their right.  They dropped out of society, acquired expensive vans and  sound systems, and hosted shows and festivals.  The travellers joined  compatible environmental and political groups' demonstrations, their sound  systems providing &quot;a focus of attention&quot;.  The author discusses  the travellers' constant battles with English police (to the point of  driving through police roadblocks and digging trenches in fields to stop  vehicles).  Mr. Collin speculates on how the travellers funded their  travels.<br />Mr Collin has written a clear and fascinating book that  documents how, in one short decade,  Ecstasy &quot;transformed whole areas  of the social landscape of Britain -- but into what, exactly, was still  unclear.&quot;/>Mr Collin has written a clear and fascinating book that  documents how, in one short decade,  Ecstasy &quot;transformed whole areas  of the social landscape of Britain -- but into what, exactly, was still  unclear.&quot;	2000-04-16

Mr. Reynolds discusses rave and techno music  and DJ mixing techniques.  He provides an extensive bibliography and  discography.  Mr. Reynolds discusses drug (over)use at rave events.

His writing also reflects a Zen monk's reverence for  food and the ritual of cooking.<br />The Tassajara Basic Yeasted Bread is  discussed in detail.  Chapters on yeasted bread, yeasted  pastry, unyeasted  bread, sourdough, pancakes, muffins and quickbreads, and desserts follow.  Recipes stress the use of natural foods and grains.  Most recipes include  alternate ingredient suggestions.<br />I first used this cookbook to make the  Tassajara Basic Yeasted Bread.  I never before had made  bread.  The whole  wheat dough was stiff.  Mixing the dough was extremely hard work.  Kneading  the dough was agony.  Making this bread taught me respect both for bread  and for anyone who makes bread.<br />I recently rediscovered this cookbook  while seeking a cornbread/muffin recipe that did not use shortening.  I  made muffins substituting molasses for honey and adding marjoram.  My  muffins were excellent both alone and with bean dishes.<br />Cooking is vastly  underrated.  One who cooks economically and maintains a clean, safe  household is free to &quot;Be All That You Can Be&quot;, an accomplishment  that would make an Army drill  sergeant or a Zen master proud.  Mr. Brown's  writing reflects that pride.	2000-02-28

It is a well-written journal describing a hellish, suburban cult experience.<br />The authors have chronicled Ms. Burchard's nineteen-year involvement with a group of  dependent, weak-willed individuals dominated by a greedy and manipulative  leader.  The leader  used verbal intimidation, physical threats, and social  isolation to erode members' self-confidence.  Ms. Burchard stagnated and  lost over $165,000 during her nineteen-year cult  experience.  She was able  to leave the cult only after Ms. Carlone met and befriended her.  Ms.  Carlone and her husband provided the insight, objectivity, and emotional  support that Ms.  Burchard needed to grow and to break with the cult.<br />The  authors' writing style conveys emotion without being sensational.  Their  description of their  experience effectively and believably portrays the  power of cultish mind control.	2000-02-23

That catalog contained detailed  descriptions of tools, books, and  organizations.  The descriptions helped individuals achieve  their  &quot;hippie&quot; counterculture goals.  The catalog preceded the  Internet, but readers' reviews of  listed or new items were published in  subsequent catalog editions, a form of interaction.  The  catalog's wide  topic range and detailed discussions formed a good composite picture of the  hippie counterculture.<br />Mr. Mercer's book does not provide equivalent  detail.  A five-page introduction and a three-page postscript discusses the  Goth subculture, but the author speaks in generalities.  The book consists  primarily of Goth band and fanzine listings with some Goth organization and  shop listings.  The book emphasizes the Goth subculture but contains some  vampire, fetish, and pagan subculture listings.<br />The typical listing is  brief.  Often only a name plus a postal address, an e-mail address, or a  fax number is given.  As important as the Internet is today there are fewer  Internet website addresses than I expected.<br />Mr. Mercer's book contains  much interesting photography.  The Goth, vampire, and pagan  subcultures  are very fashion- and fetish-oriented.  The photography reflects those  orientations.  With the exception of the front and back covers the book's  photography is black and white  photography.<br />I believe that a  &quot;bible&quot; should define its subject.  This book's brief listings  and photography do not answer my original question: &quot;What is the Goth  subculture?&quot;  The front cover's photograph itself raises a question  that the book doesn't answer.

The writing style assumes Wiccan background  knowledge that solitary Wiccan novices will not have (knowledge that this book and its  predecessor do not provide).  Yet this  book's discussions are not very useful for experienced  Wiccans.  This book  is disappointing compared to Mr. Cunningham's excellent first book  &quot;Wicca:  A Guide For The Solitary Practitioner&quot;.<br />In this book  Mr. Cunningham is careful (pp. xi, 87, 124, and 138) to state that he is  assisting  solitary Wiccans who lack access to Coven teaching resources.  He also states that solitary Wiccans must carefully incorporate basic  Wiccan principles into their worship.  The reader wonders if Mr.  Cunningham's first book was criticized for its free and open writing  style.<br />Chapter 2, &quot;Secrecy&quot;, strongly discusses a controversial  Wiccan topic.  Here Mr. Cunningham  acknowledges past persecution of  Wiccans, and discusses his own past dealings with non-Wiccans.  He also  discusses the role of secrecy in magical activities.<br />Chapters 3 through 7  deal with everyday Wiccan practices.  Chapters 8 through 11 deal with  Wiccan prayer and provide example prayers.  These chapters' discussions are  weak.<br />Chapter 12, &quot;Magic and the Solitary Wiccan&quot;, deals with  raising energy within the Circle and with  directing it outside the Circle.  This chapter's discussion relates primarily to Wiccan Coven  members.  Mr.  Cunningham acknowledges (pg. 78) that the solitary Wiccans has few  energy-raising options.<br />The remainder of this book addresses creating and  documenting your own Wiccan tradition.  Mr.  Cunningham discusses the  Wiccan Goddess and the God.  His Wiccan God discussion assumes  an  alienation of affection not reflected in his first book or in other Wiccan  literature.  Mr.  Cunningham also discusses ritual accessories, ritual  design, and traditional Wiccan beliefs and  rules (with example Sets).  He  discusses creating your own Book of Shadows.  Mr. Cunningham ends with an  excellent discussion concerning if and how One should teach Wiccan beliefs  to others.<br />This book includes a comprehensive listing of Wiccan symbols  (pg. 154).

It discusses experiences with unbelievable phenomena (e.g., an  ever-present and controlling satanic &quot;spirit guide&quot;, pg. 118) in a manner that lessens the  author's credibility.  In addition, the author weakens her own credibility by portraying herself  as a stoic rather than as one who acts to rescue herself.  Also, it appears  that someone else  (unattributed) wrote the book's Chapter 14, &quot;The  Divine Prescription&quot;.<br />The book's Chapter 16, &quot;The Ritually  Abused Child&quot;, is well-written and useful.  It discusses  physical and  psychological abuse symptoms that parents would notice, how abuse might  affect a  child, and a parent's role both in helping a child recover and  also in working with physicians and clergy.<br />The book's overall lack of  credibility is unfortunate.  The book's topics (child abuse,  and brainwashing) are important topics that deserve  strong and objective discussion.  In addition, the author clearly *has*  been abused, has suffered personality dysfunction, and has real experiences  to discuss.

I  accepted her narrative at face value: a true discussion of her experiences.  Ms. Ramsland, a  New York  journalist, begins her vampirism research on the Internet.  She uses her  Internet  knowledge to visit vampire clubs and affluent events in New York  where she meets and interviews vampiric individuals.  Ms. Ramsland uses her  New York knowledge and contacts to locate additional vampire clubs,  affluent events, and individuals in Los Angeles and Paris.  Her narrative  describes her interviews, experiences, and observations at each location,  and contrasts how the vampiric lifestyle differs at each location.<br />Ms.  Ramsland recounts her interviews and her reactions.  There are very few  interviews with  mental health professionals and academics.  Most  interviews are with vampiric individuals. Some interviews are unfocused and  ponderous, while others are concise and illuminating.<br />Ms. Ramsland does  mention Anne Rice's books.  Many individuals first choose the vampiric  lifestyle after reading Ms. Rice's books, and many vampiric individuals  identify with characters in Ms. Rice's books.<br />Ms. Ramsland dwells little  on how HIV/AIDS affects the vampiric lifestyle.  One interviewee does  discuss &quot;closed covens&quot; whose members have been screened for  AIDS.  However, one interviewee states that few vampiric individuals worry  about disease, most interviewees discuss seeking strangers when conducting  their vampiric activities, and fatalism is discussed repeatedly  throughout  the book.  More discussion of HIV/AIDS in the vampiric community is  warranted.<br />Ms. Ramsland's narratives cover a wide topic range.  These  topics include dental appliances,  fashion, fetish, role-playing, BDSM  (including blood sports), necrophilia, and murder.  This  book's wide  ranging discussion can confuse the reader and lessen a topic's impact on  the  reader.

Couples with failing relationships typically communicate  little, have few common activities, and have poor or no sex.  Learning Tantra is a fun activity that teaches couples to  communicate and trust.  Furthermore, Tantra gives couples a common  activity that makes them feel special.  They develop intimacy that their  friends do not have.<br />Tantra encourages fitness.  No one need be  musclebound to enjoy Tantra, but fitness makes  Tantra more pleasurable.  At the same time some Tantric exercises are quite physically undemanding.  Unfit individuals can enjoy Tantra also.<br />The book is well-written and  well-illustrated, and discusses many of Ms. Anand's experiences.  It  discusses Tantric sexual techniques, but does not discuss Tantric history  and mythology in detail.<br />Ms. Anand's book first asks the reader to  examine their own sexuality in terms of Tantric  principles.  Two chapters  discuss opening lines of communication and trust between partners, and  developing skills for enhancing intimacy.<br />The chapter &quot;Opening The  Inner Flute&quot; is necessarily technical.  This chapter discusses the  Tantric and Taoist principle of the &quot;chakras&quot; (energy centers)  which permit &quot;mental orgasm&quot;.  Mental orgasm is non-ejaculatory,  encompasses the entire body, and is superior to a genital  orgasm.  The  chapter includes exercises to help partners begin to experience their  chakras.<br />Ms. Anand next discusses &quot;self-pleasuring&quot; (foreplay)  as a technique for breaking through  individual sexual inhibitions and for  building a couple's sexual intimacy and trust.  Another  chapter discusses  role-playing games that allow couples to communicate in a non-threatening  manner.  The book does *not* mention using safewords, an omission that  might cause discomfort while couples are learning Tantric positions.<br />The  remainder of the book progressively develops Tantric sexual techniques and  positions that  individuals and couples can experience and enjoy.

The book is very well-written.  It is suitable for true beginners, but contains extensive  detail making it valuable for the more advanced Wiccan.<br />Mr. Cunningham's  Wiccan philosophy differs from other Wiccan authors.  Other authors stress  Wiccan history, Wicca's established rituals, coven  membership benefits,  and the apprenticeship  required before Wiccan initiation.  Mr.  Cunningham's philosophy emphasizes attitude rather than organization.  Specifically, Mr. Cunningham discusses specific Wiccan beliefs and goals:  belief in the Goddess and God; concern for the Earth; social consciousness;  and the right not to be dominated by others.  He states that sincere living  and supporting these Wiccan beliefs is more important than perfect  performance of dogmatic rituals:  &quot;Ineffective ritual kills  spirituality.&quot;<br />This philosophy seems trivial, but it mirrors  (British philosopher) Bertrand Russell's statements that ethics are more  important than religious dogma.  Mr. Cunningham's philosophy is very  relevant to individuals who have fled the dogma of organized religions and  who seek a more  personal form of worship within Wicca.<br />Mr. Cunningham's  approach offers much flexibility.  A sincere practitioner can perform their  own  Wiccan initiation or have no initiation.  Brutal physical ordeals are  not required within an  initiation rite.  An initiation rite uses spiritual  tools (chanting, visualization, meditation, etc.) to achieve ritual states  of consciousness.<br />The book's first section discusses Wiccan Theory.  This  section discusses the Deities; Magick  and Magickal Tools; Rituals, the  Circle, and the Altar; the Days of Power (Sabbats and Esbats);  and  Reincarnation (a topic not discussed in other Wiccan books).  The Deity  discussion includes  both the Goddess and God, and also the minor deities  (Egyptian, Greek, Roman, etc.).  The  Magick discussion differentiates  between the types  of magick performed by magickians and shamans, and  Wiccan magick:  &quot;Wiccans don't perform destructive, manipulative, or  exploitive magic.&quot;<br />The discussion of Rituals, the Circle, and the  Altar describes ritual preparation in detail.  Mr.  Cunningham's book  contains a Wiccan color chart (pg. 50) that I found both unique and  interesting.  The Wiccan color chart differs *greatly* from the West Coast  &quot;popular culture&quot; color scheme so widely propagated by the  entertainment industry.  For example, in the  Wiccan color chart Black signifies protection, the Universe, and lack of  falsehood.  In the popular culture color scheme Black symbolizes evil.  Many individuals misinterpret Wicca's symbolic use of the color Black with  *unfortunate* consequences.<br />The book's second section covers Wiccan  Practice, and discusses exercises and magickal techniques, self-dedication,  and ritual design.  Exercises include breathing, meditation, and  visualization.  The Self-Dedication Section presents a self-dedication  ritual, and (pg. 89) also  encourages solitary Wiccans to participate in  community activities that are compatible with Wiccan goals.  The Ritual  Design Section shows how  the solitary Wiccan can modify the book's  rituals to better meet their own philosophies and goals.<br />The book's third  section is a Book Of Shadows.  It  includes collections of rituals,  invocations, and  recipes; and a guide to using herbs, plants, crystals,  symbols and runes in Wiccan ritual.  The  discussion of Sabbat and Esbat  rituals is especially detailed.<br />The book contains Appendices listing  suppliers and  publications.  A Glossary is included.  An  extensive  Suggested Reading List organized by Pagan/Wiccan topic also is  included.<br />Mr. Cunningham is an excellent author, provides excellent  detail concerning Wicca and its  rituals, and provides a practical approach  to Wiccan worship.

The first challenge is determining the book's author.  The  cover sheet and title page list Marie Laveau as the author.  The publisher's offerings list states that Anna Riva is the  author.  The book's &quot;Spiritism&quot; Introduction is written by N. D.  P. Bivins, and the Preface refers to the author as &quot;he&quot;.  I  assume that Anna Riva has compiled a book of Marie Laveau's original  spells.<br />Marie Laveau was the Queen of &quot;Voodoo Women&quot;.  Today,  the New Orleans magick supply shop she once owned still is open for  business.  Her New Orleans gravesite is a shrine where people leave  offerings for luck.  (When I visited I left some pocket coins as an  offering.  Another person had left his business card.  I did not leave my  business card.  One cannot know what luck will appear at One's door.)<br />The  book principally concentrates on Marie Laveau's spells.  The spells have an  old, New  Orleans flavor, but the spells are _usable_today_.  This book's  spells deal both with personal  problems and also with business problems.  Most spells are presented as a Supplicant's petition  followed by Ms.  Laveau's reply.  The reply states what ritual must be performed (using  supplies  available from Ms. Laveau's shop) in order to cast the spell.  The supplies listed include &quot;Extract  of Bend Over&quot;, &quot;Master  Oil&quot;, &quot;Jockey Club Perfume&quot;, and &quot;Lucky John The  Conqueror Incense&quot;.<br />Examples of personal problem spells include  &quot;Going To Trial&quot; (&quot;That my enemies will villify me  and say  untruths, blasphemy, and perjure me...&quot;), &quot;The Person Who Wished  To Be Uncrossed&quot; (&quot;My dear ones look with suspicion on me and  strangers hearken not to my voice...&quot;), &quot;To Stop Gossip&quot;  (&quot;Oh good mother I have to hang my head when I pass the friend or  stranger for I know not the viper tongue that has reached them...&quot;),  and &quot;To Conquer Those Who Have Made You Suffer&quot; (&quot;Oh dear  mother I come to you with tears in my eyes and weak from the pains that I  have suffered through the work of my enemies. ...&quot;)<br />Examples of  business problem spells include &quot;The Lady Who Has An Empty House&quot;  (&quot;The stranger passes my door and sees me not, neither do they stop  nor look into my house. ...&quot;), &quot;The Person Whose Business Is In  Bad Shape&quot; (&quot;For where there was light and laughter now there is  only silence, where many feet wore out the threshold of my front door.  ...&quot;), &quot;The Gambling Hand&quot; (&quot;...when I sit me down  among the select men and play with them the game of cards, you do not put  into my hands the cards which will undo my opponents, but instead you put  into the hand of the other players the high cards which will make them my  masters. ...&quot;), and &quot;The Lucky Hand&quot; (&quot;When I see good  merchandise and good chattles which I can easily get and sell at much  profit, lo when they come into my hands they are only dross and have no  value. ...&quot;)<br />The book also contains instructions on decorating for  luck, the Novena, and use of candles and  playing cards.  In addition, the  book contains one of the nicest interpretations of the astrological  signs  have I have encountered.<br />Ms. Riva's book is an odd book that has no Table  of Contents or Index.  Reading the book much  resembles a tourist visit to  New Orleans: One wonders around, learning as One wanders.  The  result is a  nice book with a sense of historical charm.o Conquer Those Who Have Made You Suffer&quot; (&quot;Oh dear  mother I come to you with tears in my eyes and weak from the pains that I  have suffered through the work of my enemies. ...&quot;)<br />Examples of  business problem spells include &quot;The Lady Who Has An Empty House&quot;  (&quot;The stranger passes my door and sees me not, neither do they stop  nor look into my house. ...&quot;), &quot;The Person Whose Business Is In  Bad Shape&quot; (&quot;For where there was light and laughter now there is  only silence, where many feet wore out the threshold of my front door.  ...&quot;), &quot;The Gambling Hand&quot; (&quot;...when I sit me down  among the select men and play with them the game of cards, you do not put  into my hands the cards which will undo my opponents, but instead you put  into the hand of the other players the high cards which will make them my  masters. ...&quot;), and &quot;The Lucky Hand&quot; (&quot;When I see good  merchandise and good chattles which I can easily get and sell at much  profit, lo when they come into my hands they are only dross and have no  value. ...&quot;)<br />The book also contains instructions on decorating for  luck, the Novena, and use of candles and  playing cards.

He discusses how his  witches control the news media.<br />Mr. LaVey's book is both humorous and  sad.  Mr. LaVey's instructions for manipulating men are absurdly  stereotypical.

Mr. Skelton's book provides an overview of Wiccan practices.  The book presents &quot;the essence of witchcraft, or 'Wicca' as it has come to be called, as it exists today.&quot;<br />Despite the title I do *not* recommend  this book as a beginner's first book.  Mr. Skelton's book provides more  detailed discussions than a beginner lacking some Wiccan knowledge can  appreciate.  In addition, Mr. Skelton's book does not explicitly discuss  his personal experiences or discuss Wiccan social organization and workings  -- the details that beginners find most relevant.  I *do* recommend this  book for advanced beginners who have read a more suitable first book  (perhaps &quot;Inside A Witches' Coven&quot; by Edain McCoy, five  star).<br />(Like Gaul,) Mr. Skelton's book is divided into three parts.  In  the first part, &quot;Answering The Questions&quot;, Mr. Skelton answers  forty-eight questions about witches, Wiccan practices, and Craftlore.  Each  question's discussion is complete without cross-referencing other  questions.  At  the same time, the questions' presentation sequence permits  smooth and enjoyable reading.<br />In the second part, &quot;Rituals and  Celebrations&quot;, Mr. Skelton discusses Commencement Rituals  (rituals  used to initiate a coven meeting), Sacra Privata (Latin for private  religious rituals), and the Witches' Calendar of sabbats and feasts.  The  Witches' Calendar is particularly well-written,  providing a history and  description for each sabbat and feast.<br />The book's third part is a  &quot;Workbook&quot; (Book of Spells).  Mr. Skelton's Workbook contains  eight categories of spells (seventy-eight spells total).  Each spell  includes a discussion of when each spell is (in)appropriate.<br />Mr.  Skelton's book closes with a comprehensive bibliography.  The bibliography  not only lists a  wide range of Wiccan-related books, but also discusses  each book's strengths.<br />I liked Mr. Skelton's book and recommend it for  advanced beginners.

The book discusses Seax-Wica history, Seax-Wica beliefs, and presents &quot;The Tree&quot;, the Seax-Wica Book of Spells.  Unlike  other Wiccan disciplines Seax-Wica has *no oath of secrecy*, the Book of  Spells is available to all, and Mr. Buckland incurs no penalty by  publishing the Seax-Wica Book of Spells.<br />The Saxons were commoners who  suffered poverty, and who suffered indenture due to crimes and debts.  Prisoners of war mixed with the Saxons.  By my interpretation, that Loki  did remove a &quot;silver circlet&quot; from the Goddess Freya's neck  indicates that the Goddess Freya herself at one time was enslaved (pg.  19).<br />Seax-Wica reflects the Saxon love of freedom and the history of  persecution by permitting Free Will in Seax-Wica rituals and worship.  _Seax-Wica witches do *not* require external assistance and control._  If  no local Coven exists or if the local Coven members' philosophies disagree  with one's own, Seax-Wica contains a &quot;Rite of Self Dedication&quot;  that allows a sincere one to initiate one self into the Craft as  Priest/ess.  The sincere one then may form a new Coven, and other Seax-Wica  Covens will recognize the sincere one's initiation and the new Coven.  The  sincere one also may choose to enter Solitary Practice.<br />Similarly, a  sincere one may choose to be initiated into the local Coven by her/his  parents instead of the local Coven's Priestess and Priest.  And a Seax-Wica  Coven member may leave or rejoin the Coven at any time with *no  penalty*.<br />Seax-Wica appears to stress fertility less than do other Wiccan  disciplines.  A 50-50 mix of  female-male Coven members is not required,  and Coven members are not paired.  Based upon my interpretation, fertility  symbolism is minimal except within the Spring (pre-planting) Sabbat (pp.  66-67).  Open elections for Priestesses and Priests are held periodically,  preventing incumbents from acquiring tenure and excessive influence.<br />Mr.  Buckland's book also discusses Divination and Herbal Lore.  The Appendices  discuss Magickal Alphabets, Seax-Wican songs, and Recipes for Beer, Wine,  and Ale.<br />Seax-Wica allows a sincere one to utilize Free Will.  A sincere  one can worship with local Coven members, can form a new Coven, or can  engage in Solitary Practice.  The lack of an Oath of  Secrecy, the ability  to leave and rejoin a Coven at any time, and the lack of penalties provides  an openness and freedom that other Wiccan disciplines lack.  Frees *will*  find their own path with  Seax-Wica.<br />I enjoyed reading this Book.

The book is a scholarly survey rather than a recounting of Ms. Adler's experiences.  Ms. Adler's book contains very few  Craftlore details.  It is *not* an introductory Paganism text.  [&quot;Inside A Witches' Coven&quot; by Edain McCoy (five-star) is a good  introductory Wiccan text.]<br />Ms. Adler discusses feminism within Paganism,  Neo- and Classical Paganism, Witchcraft and Wicca, Odinism (and the Nazi's  use of Odinist symbols), the Church of All Worlds, Druidism, and Shamanism.  Satanism is discussed only briefly.  Ms. Adler discusses Pagan groups'  treatment by each other, by their communities, and by the media.<br />Ms.  Adler's book is better suited for interested third-parties than for active  Pagans.

Mr. Melton's 852-page book is truly encyclopedic.  It is well-indexed.  It includes brief discussions of vampiric cultural history, &quot;What is a Vampire?&quot;, and vampiric chronology.  It provides individual detailed  discussions of worldwide vampire-related topics.  The book's Appendices  provide comprehensive listings of vampire &quot;resources&quot;,  filmography, drama, and novels.<br />The book's encyclopedic organization  *does* present a problem to the &quot;front-to-back&quot; reader. Identical  material is repeated in related entries because each entry is meant to  stand alone.  This repetition is quite evident to the front-to-back  reader.<br />One criticism: the sexual aspects and psychology of vampirism  were not discussed in the detail they merit.  Vampires control their  (usually opposite gender) victims magickally, and vampires have (usually  recurring) physical relationships with their victims.  In some cases  vampires kidnap and imprison their victims.  These sexually dominant  aspects of vampirism are emphasized in vampiric literature, drama, and  cinema.  Furthermore, vampires draw blood, a concern in today's environment  of sexually-transmitted diseases.  A more complete discussion of vampire  sexuality and today's vampire cult practices would have been  welcome.<br />This book is difficult to read, but will assist you in your next  Trivial Pursuit game!	1999-11-21

This book is a very common sense discussion of how to find and/or form a meeting group and/or coven.  (Ms. McCoy defines a meeting group as a group of Witches/Pagans that meet to  exchange ideas and socialize without the vows and commitments that a coven  requires.)  Ms. McCoy does not go deeply into Craftlore, but does tell one  what s/he can expect from initiations and healing spells.<br />A caveat: one  must know the jargon.  Several items (delay until 1995 [one know no delete  -- i.e., forever], nine (nein) years -&gt; (i.e., forever), a year and a  day (366 -&gt; open hex sex -&gt; sexual abstinence for the duration)  handfasting period, casting the circle counterclockwise (reverse the clock  -&gt; undo a spell or vow).<br />Ms. McCoy is to be commended because she  *does* recount people problems that she has had during her career, and  cautions the importance of finding a coven compatible with one's  philosophy. Too many dictatorial leaders spoil what should be a happy and  rewarding Craft experience.<br />Despite the problems decoding the jargon, I  like this book.	1999-11-19
