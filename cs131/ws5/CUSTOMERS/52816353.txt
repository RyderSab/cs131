Almost every Marine I ever met was described to a tee in this book, including Captain America, Encino Man and Casey Kasems. I never would have believed that people could be such 'retards' had I not already met officers just like them.<br /><br />For the most part, though, they were men doing an extremely tough job to whom I would entrust my life.	2005-08-21
US	52816353	R3V1RUMGB9X8H9	0375401466	160007841	Old School	Books	4	6	6	N	N	A Literary Treat	At the risk of making it sound dull (which it isn't), 'Old School' is a primer on the philosophy of literature. As with a good education, good literature doesn't just feed you information and stories, it helps you to think for and about yourself and who you are. Wolff's book is a rare treat. It posed questions about the lives and thoughts of great writers and of each of us as well. What makes a story 'great'? Was Robert Frost's writing more `real' than Allen Ginsberg's? What makes a truer hero: Ayn Rand's Ubermench or Hemingway's wounded soul? And finally, what does any of this have to do with us and our lives?<br /><br />Wolff's answer is simple. Only when we strip away the masks and are honest with ourselves about whom we are can we be great, or for that matter happy or even comfortable with ourselves.<br /><br />`Old School' is one of those rare opportunity to learn something while enjoying yourself. Don't miss it.	2004-12-23

Jeanne DuPrau deftly avoids the trap that many new authors fall into of trying to replicate the format that succeeded in the first book.  While 'The People of Sparks' presents a more familiar setting than 'City of Ember', she still manages to paint a landscape unlike any we know.<br /><br />If the author had stayed with that and limited herself to showing us her vision of a post-apocalyptic world then I would have been disappointed. As it is she gives us a whole new story. What would happen if a village of 300 mostly good people find themselves faced with the challenge of taking care of 400 starving refugees without the skills and resources to fend for themselves? Tensions would build as resources dwindle and us/them divisions would be sure to arise. Is this a small-scale version of the same conflicts that brought about the global cataclysm of the misty past? It's a good story and the reader might just finish it a little wiser.	2004-07-27

Although parts of the book were physically painful to read, the end result was a great work of love and redemption. I generally don't care for characters who are quite so spineless but I was able to identify with Amir and ultimately learned something about myself in the process.<br />Hosseini provides great insight into the relationship between sons and their fathers and the damage we can do to ourselves when we use our fathers as the yardstick by which we judge ourselves. How can we ever be satisfied with who we are when we have a father who can 'wrestle a bear'?<br />'The Kite Runner' is written with such startling realism that I can't help but think it is largely autobiographical. The settings of both Amir's childhood in Kabul and his adult life in the Bay Area are lovingly written with such clarity that I almost believe that I could go over the hill to Fremont and meet the very people described in the book.	2004-07-08

On top of that is the almost unbelievable tale of the survivors' journey out of the desert.<br />I found Skeletons on the Zahara particularly interesting in light of the current strained relations between the eastern and western worlds. Although almost 200 years have passed since the events described occurred I thinks we can still learn something regarding the differences between the cultures. Sidi Hamet was a fascinating character. Although not entirely honest he was fundamentally decent. His very existence in such a hostile environment seems incredible yet there he was and at least five sailors lived to see home again because of him.	2004-04-22

Bernard Fall describes brilliantly the strategy and tactics used by Vo Nguyen Giap and the Viet Minh against the French. These tactics changed very little from one war to the next yet we, forewarned (assuming we had read this book), walked right into it.<br />This is a classic example of the old axiom that he who fails to learn from history is doomed to repeat it.<br />What I found particularly disturbing about `Street Without Joy ` is Giap's description of the evolution of his enemies' tactics; an initial offensive, slowing and turning into a defensive war with a growing amount of public sentiment against involvement. Does this sound familiar?	2003-11-05

Contrary to what many reviewers would have you believe, `Under the Banner of Heaven' is not poorly researched nor is it intended to be an attack on religion in general or the Mormon Church in specific.  Krakauer's portrayal of early LDS history is well-supported, often by church records. In cases where he ventures into speculation he says so and limits his speculation to cases, such as the Powell expedition murders, where supporting evidence exists.  Krakauer showed restraint in these chapters by choosing not to include the murder of  the U.S. Survey party of John W. Gunnison and other suspicious deaths in the area.<br />What I found most fascinating, though, is the theological issues that this book brings up. Krakauer does not denigrate religion per se but poses the question of what is the dividing line between faith and fanaticism. If we can believe that God told Isaiah to kill his own son, why can't we believe that he didn't also tell Dan Lafferty to kill his brother's wife? It's an unpleasant question but it makes you think and that is something Jon Krakauer is very good at.	2003-09-24

After reading the cover I expected a clever little book that light-heartedly showed off the author's skill at manipulating the English language. While it is that, it is also a profound social allegory that levies a scathing indictment against governments ruled by fundamentalist doctrine. There's an unsettling similarity between Nollop, where people who use proscribed letters are forced to emigrate, and another country where those who perform medical research must go elsewhere if they wish to obtain funding.<br />&quot;Ella Minnow Pea&quot; belongs on the shelf next to Orwell's &quot;Animal Farm&quot;.	2002-11-06

There are so many aspects of it that cry out for discussion. How does Davy's life on the lam compare with Swede's 'Legend of Sunny Sundown'? Why does Reuben Land's father use his miraculous abilities to cure the man who fires him but not his own son? Are Jeremiah Land and Jape Waltzer symbolic representations of<br />God and Satan? Does Reuben's nickname, 'Rube', mean Leif Enger wants us to him as an unsophisticated yokel?<br />Most of the book reads like a cool drink of water. It's refreshing and goes down easy. Seen through the innocent eyes of children a story with lots of room for gray areas is portrayed mostly in shades of black and white. As a child, Reuben understands goodness and so describes Roxanna's goodness in rich detail. His understanding of evil is not so complete and so his description of Jape is sketchy at best. We know there's something evil about him. We're just not exactly sure what it is.<br />One final question that merits discussion is, 'Why the lame ending?' Don't get me wrong. Fore the most part, the book is great. It's just that I've seen drunkards' zippers with more closure. With Swede and all her western romanticism, one would think that that there would be something at the end akin to riding off into the sunset. Unfortunately, that's not the case.	2002-10-12

Of those, 38 planes bearing 6,595 passengers landed in Gander, Newfoundland, a town with a population of barely 10,000. What happened next goes a very long way to restore the faith in humanity that was shaken by the terrorists. Without exception, the residents of Gander (They call themselves `Newfies') opened their doors to welcome the unexpected refugees and poured out such warmth and compassion that one passenger later remarked, \\"I was on a flight from London to New York and landed in Heaven.\\"<br />Schools were closed to provide space for shelters. Residents took the sheets and blankets off their own beds to deliver to the passengers and stayed up all night to feed and welcome then when they finally were able to get off the planes. Locals approached `plane people' in the street and invited them into their homes to shower. Pharmacists made thousands of calls worldwide to verify prescriptions and then filled them for free. Shop owners gave away their stock to those in need and, when they ran out, bought more from the competition and gave that away as well. The events described in this book will make you either proud to be a Canadian or regretful that you aren't.<br />DeFede skillfully blends the tragic and the comic. One moment Gander's residents are compassionately providing around-the-clock care and companionship to the mother of a missing New York firefighter. Meanwhile, other locals are making honorary Newfoundlanders out of several passengers by means of an age-old ceremony involving kissing a codfish and drinking the local liquor whose name, Screech, is apparently an apt description of its flavor.<br />There's even a little karma thrown in. When the principal of the Lewisporte Middle School allows a passenger to use their computer center to `run a small business' she doesn't discover until later that the passenger's name was Gordon Conway and the `small business' that he was running out of her school was the Rockefeller Foundation.  Needless to say, her generosity resulted in a new computer center for her students.<br />After the end of their involuntary visit to Gander, many of the passengers have since returned to Gander to visit and express their appreciation to those who were so kind and generous to them. I, too, plan to visit Gander someday, if for no other reason than to see what kind of people it takes to shine such a bright light on one of the darkest days in our history.<br />I'd also like to find out what Screech tastes like.e, Screech, is apparently an apt description of its flavor. <br />There's even a little karma thrown in.

For simple reading it's a gritty story of murder, revenge and steamy passion. It centers on a feud between the two leading families of the Plaquemines Parish, LA, oyster industry. Felix Petitjean and family represent the long established leading family of the parish while Darryl `Horse' Bruneau and his three sons are the brash, heavy-fisted newcomers who have carved a niche for themselves by buying up the leases of destitute competitors.<br />Horse (\\"This child wants to know why I'm called The Horse. Think she's old enough to see?\\") dies early in the story but his personality is so forceful that his spirit is felt long after his body sinks into the bayou. Even dead he manipulates the actions of the story's characters, for good or (more likely) ill.<br />At first I was concerned that Biguenet was steering his readers toward a Cajun `Romeo and Juliet' but he avoided falling into that trap. That would not have worked at all in this rough-and-tumble setting. In its place, the author offered a much more compelling plot, deftly enhanced by intricately woven interrelationships of love and hatred.<br />But Biguenet, an English professor at Loyola, didn't settle for just a simple read. Some have compared John Biguenet to William Faulkner but I don't see it. James Dickey maybe, but I never found Faulkner to be this entertaining. Nevertheless, social allegory lurks just below the surface of Bayou Petitjean, as omnipresent as the gators. Therese Petitjean is stirring up existence in Egret Pass as certainly and inexorably as the channels cut by the oil companies are changing the sedentary life of the oysters. It soon becomes very apparent that \\"It ain't like the old days, Darryl.\\"<br />This is a must read. Rustle up some shrimp etouffee, put on the Beausoleil and make yourself very comfortable. You won't want to put this down for a long time.	2002-09-10

Sharyn McCrumb is the author of three mystery series, each very different from the others. This is the third book featuring forensic anthropologist Elizabeth MacPherson. They are fairly lightwight and humorous. Some of her later volumes ('MacPherson's Lament' and If I'd Killed Him When I Met Him...') combine current and historic mysteries which I found particulary intriguing.<br /><br />This mix of contemporary and historical mysteries is also a key element of her second series. Based in the mountains of eastern Tennessee with titles gleaned from old Appalachian folk songs it is a more serious collection that is rich in the beauty and folklore of the region. My personal favorite is 'She Walks These Hills'.<br /><br />On the off chance that there is someone out there looking for something a little more irreverent than 'Highland Laddie Gone,' McCrumb has an answer for that, too. The title says it all:<br /><br /> 'Bimbos of the Death Sun'<br /><br />Don't laugh. It won an Edgar.	2002-08-23

At the center of it all is the marathon interrogation session going on in interrogation room 3. Oddly, this sparring between the detective and the child murder suspect is by far the most personal and intimate exchange in the book. We hang on every question and response, whether verbal or by body language. Is he guilty? Will he crack? What will they do to him if he doesn't? What will the new day bring?

The cover alone would have sold me but, alas, you know what the pundits say on that subject.<br />Gold's research into Carter and the historical characters of his day allowed him to create a rich, atmospheric and multifaceted setting for his story. I was fully able to forget about the 21st century Bay Area and put myself back to 1923 Oakland and San Francisco.  Unfortunately, once there I didn't find a single person worth the trip.<br />Gold writes well but it appears that he was unable to set aside his screenwriting skills and get down to some serious behind-the-scenes character development. While I could clearly envision just about every scene in the book I never formed an emotional attachment to any character, good or bad. He seldom delved into what made his characters tick and end result is that I didn't fully  understand them or care much for them. They seemed more like cardboard cut-outs than flesh-and-blood people. In one scene he describes a horrendous case of abuse by The Carter family caretaker yet drops the matter almost as soon as it was over. Are we to believe the only effect it had on Charles was to give him an appreciation for escape tricks?<br />Another concern I had about the book was the Secret Service agent who kept chasing after Carter like a dog with a bone despite the fact that there wasn't a single shred of evidence that Harding's death was anything but natural. We know, of course, that he'll eventually find something but he just didn't seem bright enough to have the intuition of a Sherlock Holmes. I seemed more like he was doing it because this is a novel and that's what the detective does in novels.<br />In the end, I did enjoy `Carter Beats the Devil' and look forward to Gold's future works now that he's had some practice at real writing.	2002-08-19

Tsung Tsai shows an uncommon ability to view the world with an almost constant air of tranquility, yet he does so without losing touch with his ability to experience such emotions as joy, grief, anger and exasperation. Add to that a delightful sense of humor and you have a book that is just plain fun to read.<br />In 'Bones of the Master', George Crane travels with and faithfully chronicles the adventures of septuagenarian Buddhist monk Tsung Tsai as he travels through China to Mongolia to pay honor to the memory of his old teacher. Through George's eyes we see a world that few westerners have ever seen.<br />The true heart of the story, though, is the interaction between the two travellers. George tries so hard to please Tsung Tsai and acts as if he understands what the monk is telling him when he really hasn't a clue and Tsung Tsai frequently gives in to the temptation to have a little fun with him. It reminds me of a man playing with a puppy and pretending to throw a stick just to watch the puppy go chasing after nothing. These games are never mean-spirited. While it is evident that each has a deep and sincere friendship for the other, I still puzzle over what the two men have in common. Perhaps, as George says, it's in the poetry.	2001-10-26

In other words, it's a great choice for a book club.<br />First is the  'Who's your daddy?' line, set in the present, in which Terry Hooper, the adult son of a former CIA operative, tries to find out what kind of person his father was. Was he a good guy or a bad guy?  At first glance this appears to be the main story in the book but I think it serves more as a  catalyst to keep the story going.<br />The second story line is the most fascinating and has the potential to generate a good deal of debate. Set in 1958, it revolves around the friendship that develops between the CIA operative and the young king of Kurash, the subject of his mission.  Is it real or just part of his assignment? If it's real, which will win out, friendship or 'duty'? What impact will it have on the characters involved?<br />The third story line in `Little America' became frighteningly relevant after what occurred when I was about halfway through it (Sept. 11).  It looks at American foreign policy through the eyes of Allen and John Foster Dulles. It expresses almost as aptly as 'The Ugly American' how totally clueless we can be when it comes to seeing the world through the eyes of others. Bromell, in a novel based in the 1950s, provides insight into how we might best respond in the current crisis.	2001-10-01

They are better described by words such a `warm', `vibrant' and `rich' than by `suspenseful', `fascinating' or `page-turner'. In \\"Death Comes for the Archbishop\\" she does to New Mexico with black ink what Georgia O'Keefe needed a whole palette of colors to do.<br />\\"Death Comes for the Archbishop\\" is a multidimensional work skillfully woven together. On one hand Cather tells the story of New Mexico in the early days of its occupation by the United States and of the clash of two cultures trying, sometimes unsuccessfully, to get along.<br />On the other hand it is a portrait of a life. It is the story of Father Latour, a French priest sent to Santa Fe by the church to serve as an impartial intermediary between the protestant Anglo government and the Mexican Catholic population. He leaves behind all that is dear to him and dedicates himself to a life of service in a distant outpost far from what he must have considered civilization.<br />While it's true that the book may be `episodic' or `anecdotal', few of us recall our own lives as a smooth, day-to-day rendering. What we remember are the high points and low points of our lives, and so it is here.  This is, after all, the story of the life, and death, of a man.<br />If you read books just to find out how they end, I'll save you the trouble. He dies. But if you read to experience the world through the heart and eyes of a great author, this book is for you.  And once you read it you will find that, for you, Father Latour, hasn't really died.

It is, instead, a year in the life of an American author spending a year with an Italian soccer team. While most journalists prefer to sit quietly in the corner and let the story unfold, Joe McGinness thrusts himself into the heart of the story, advising players, second-guessing coaches and attacking the team's management by nailing vicious diatribes against them to the team office door.  I marveled that one of his previous books was suggested as an example of quality investigative reporting when I was in journalism school.<br />It surprises me that, while he loses all objectivity in his coverage of the Castel Di Sangro story, he manages to maintain it when viewing himself. He had no problem admitting that he acted like a jerk at times. As is often the case, though, admitting something and correcting it are often two different things.<br />I enjoyed the book once I realized that its main focus was McGinness himself. His almost rabid obsession with the game, his naivete (especially coming from someone who wrote a book about Nixon), and his passionate love for the team, made for an very interesting story, especially with its surprising ending.<br />There is still one thing I don't understand, though. How can he consider a game in which a team can play for over six hours without scoring a point exciting?	2000-10-12

We know of William the Conqueror and his victory at the Battle of Hastings. What few know is who it was he fought against and what that enemy was like.<br />Now, 931 years after the fact, Elizabeth Alder has told us the story of Harold II, the last Saxon king of England. We are shown Harold's tragic story through the eyes of his \\"shadow\\", a voiceless squire who becomes one of the king's most trusted friends.<br />While some apparently think the story boring, it touched me like few other books have. Harold is portrayed as one of the few kings who gives all of himself for his realm and it is heartbreaking to read of all his efforts to unite England, knowing that in a very short while it will all be gone. Even the chapter headings tick off the years leading up to 1066 like some sort of death knell.<br />As to how this story has anything to do with us? If it were not for the events in this story many of us, myself included, would not even be able to read this book. We would be speaking and reading French.	2000-10-02

I've read many novels about characters that manage to do the  impossible but, until now, I have never read a nonfiction account of the  impossible. Shackleton's crewmen described him as the \\"greatest leader on  earth, bar none.\\"  That must be close to true for him to have brought them  home safely from that incredible voyage.	2000-08-25

All in all, \\"On Mexican Time\\" is a pretty good read if you want to find out a little about living in Mexico and the people (both natives and  imports) that you will encounter there.<br />In their fifteen years in San  Miguel de Allende Tony and Masako gain a pretty good appreciation for the  Mexican way of life. I'm not saying they adopted that way of life because,  from beginning to end, they both remained very much norteamericanos  (Spanish PC for gringo). I, too, have lived in Mexico and I believe that  those of us born north of the border will never fully understand all the  elements that make up the Mexican psyche, and visa versa. Who we are, as a  culture, is a concatenation of centuries of historical, theological and  sociological factors. It is unlikely that any of us can fully understand  why another culture acts the way it does.<br />Nevertheless, Cohan aptly  portrays the `sabor' of `la vida mexicana'.  His descriptions of the  joys and sorrows of the Mexican nationals and the quirky behavior of the  expatriates bring clearly to mind many people I have known. While I haven't  been to San Miguel de Allende his description of the city; its streets,  shops, festivals and homes, is a very accurate portrayal of many other  cities in Mexico.<br />On the down side, he could have done with a lot less  about all their shopping. If I read the words `plaid bolsa' one more time  it will be too many. While some description of the differences between our  two cultures is in order, I feel like I've just read his entire grocery  list for the past 15 years.	2000-08-16

Our copy is torn and battered from constant reading yet still our daughters dissolve into  giggles every time they hear \\"My little sister ate three ants. She even ate  their underpants\\".  Bill Grossman clearly knows what kids find funny and  has a keen appreciation for what is just plain silly. It's descending  repetition (Think \\"12 days of Christmas&quot;) also has helped them to  improve their vocabularies and reading skills, if not their table manners.	2000-08-11

I read it the old fashioned way, on audiocassette.<br />I can't  help but be confused by all the reviewers who were \\"disappointed\\" by this  book. It reminds me of the story of the man who picked up a rattlesnake and  was surprised when it bit him. After all, his is a book by Michael  Crichton, the king of the formulaic thriller.  Take some good guys, some  bad guys some greedy guys and some altruistic guys, throw them into a  dangerous, otherworldly setting and see what happens. If you don't like the  way he writes, don't pick it up! You read it to be entertained and, in that  regard, `Timeline' succeeds admirably.<br /> If you want something more  scholarly, read Barbara Tuchman's \\"A Distant Mirror\\", (which Crichton  relied on heavily for period info). It's almost as thrilling, lots more  informative and it's not even fiction.	2000-08-08

I read `I capture the Castle' over a year ago and enjoyed it even though  (forgive me for using the `R' word) it is a romance, which I don't usually  find too interesting. What I find amazing is that it has stuck in my mind  like the contents of a child's treasure box.<br />The setting of the castle  is as clear in my mind today as it was when I read about it and it gives me  a pang of regret to realize that it is only a place of fiction and not one  I can ever lay eyes on. In truth, though, it appears more vividly in the  imagination that it ever could if it were made of mere stone.  Seldom has a  title of a book been so apropos.<br />I would say more about Dodie Smith's  portrayal of the characters but others have done so. I do regret that she  didn't leave the world with more of her books.<br />I can't wait to introduce  my daughters to it.	2000-08-08

Concealed in a lively and  exciting story is an accurate picture of the harrowing experiences and  horrendous working conditions of the Chinese workers who built the railway  through the Sierras. While other books may extol those who built the great  transcontinental railway with their vision and capital, few can top  Laurence Yep's tale of those who did it with their blood, sweat and tears.	2000-08-08

After a 20-year hiatus from John Irving I decided to give him another try.  As in \\"The World According to Garp\\", his skill at character development is  unparalleled in modern fiction. Each character in the book is unique. They  are complex yet fit seamlessly into the story and, without exception, they  are enjoyable.  Unfortunately, as with `Garp', the plot is anything  but seamless. The wealth of detail that makes the characters so lifelike  weighs heavily on the plot and it tends to drag in several places. In  others, vast periods of time are skipped over with hardly a mention and I  felt like I've skipped a few chapters. I didn't feel like I \\"had to\\" finish  it but it was only because I was interested in the characters that I stuck  it out. Whatever I read next, though, will definitely have to have a  snappier pace to it.  In its defense, I will say that \\"Cider House  Rules\\" would be a great selection for a discussion group. It should be easy  to pick apart its many interesting details, especially since they aren't  that tightly woven together to begin with.	2000-08-02

Billy Mann is  raised by an alcoholic grandfather who is often too besotted to provide  Billy with his basic physical needs yet who somehow manages to instill in  him a rich appreciation of who he is and where he comes from. Kowalski  often uses the name 'Mann' as a pun to point out that there is a little of  Billy Mann in all of us. Hopefully, his first work is evidence of other  great books to come.	2000-02-27

If you like books where you can relate to empathize with the main character, this might not be your cup of tea. Alice clearly had  some serious self esteem issues that she dealt with in rather unorthadox  ways. When I look at her reaction to people, though, I think that she is,  in her own way, as racially biased as was her father. This would be an  excellent choice for a discussion group.	2000-01-13
