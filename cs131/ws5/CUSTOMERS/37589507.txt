Cormac McCarthy wrote one of my favorite books (\\"All the Pretty Horses\\") and is one of the more poetic American writers going.  The Border Trilogy, of which \\"Cities of the Plain\\" is the final volume, features great writing with some occasional humor and more than a dose of tragedy.  So what about this book? <br /> <br />\\"Cities of the Plain\\" features John Grady Cole and Billy Parham as the primary characters.  Those who have read the previous novels in this series will remember some of their childhood antics and to be honest, John Grady Cole is a rather childlike character in this novel.  \\"Cities of the Plain\\" is essentially an incomprehensible love story interspersed with adult musings on life and death.  The writing is great with some annoying segments written entirely in Spanish as we learn about 1950s New Mexico (and Old Mexico) and follow Cole on his poorly conceived love quest. <br /> <br />The highlight, however, is a beautifully described incident involving a cat on page 125--A tale so inspiring that I've started calling my wife's annoying tabby \\"Comet\\".  On the otherhand, the Epilogue was even more incomprehensible than the love story.  Not McCarthy's best, but worth reading (except for the Epilogue).	2005-06-26

They (\\"Deception Point\\" and \\"Angels & Demons\\") were fast paced, easy to read, and contained some interesting (and perhaps bogus) information about science and theology.  This book is similar in the last regard, but a little sluggish in terms of pace.  The writing is unpoetic (there is no other word for it) and the plot is silly.  Bessie loved all the gibberish about the sacred femini and even insisted I refer to her as The Grail after she caught me sneaking a beer at little Chad's school play.  Well, I found it pretty ridiculous (the book, not the beer).  Almost as ridiculous as the casting in that \\"film\\" 'The Return of Martin Short'.  But my real complaint isn't about the content--which is poor at best--but about the item itself:<br /><br />The pictures are nice, appropriate, and a-plenty. However, the book itself is bulky, heavy, hard to read in unnatural light (the pages are too shimmery), and just plain annoying to lug around.  Worst of all, I hurt my excellent throwing arm tossing it across the room after Bessie shouted \\"I am the sacred femini, worship me\\" after I asked her to refill my beer mug.  A losing situation in every regard.  And not recommend to anyone.	2005-04-23

He has a gift for portraying human frailty with comedy and grace.  And this book is no exception.  It is, however, an average read at best. <br /> <br />It's basically about a Jewish high school teacher (two more things I'm not) and his wife and what happens when one of the students goes a little nutty (the publisher's review above gives away too much in my estimation--I hope you haven't read it).  It's part love story and part commentary on the human condition.  It moves a bit slowly and veers almost into fantasy land about midway.  I didn't expect, or like that.  I also didn't like the insult directed at our current President by Patsy on page 52.  I did, however, really enjoy Chapter 27 (the last chapter).  Moderately recommended.	2004-12-10

Linda Lee has done a very good thing.  She's written a concise and much needed book on why it's not so important for kids to go to college anymore.  She ignores the fact that colleges have gotten ridiculously simple with all the grade inflation and silly admission policies and instead focuses on how unambitious and industrious young people can thrive in today's environment without the shackles of a college diploma.   <br /> <br />This is a very important book and one I have already gift wrapped and placed in the care of the USPS as a special \\"present\\" for my second ex-wife (the supposed mother of my first three children).  I've been sending the witch too much of my meager paychecks for the past ten years and she's already started yapping about the \\"college expenses\\".  Thanks to Ms. Lee, I am very hopeful that instead of the ridiculously overpriced college tuition bills I can get by with this much less expensive \\"guide\\" to life without college.  Who needs frat beer bashes and sorority panty parties?  Not my kids.  This book will do just fine.  Very Highly Recommended.  HHD. <br />	2004-12-04

Fraser) for a whole slew of extremely valid reasons. However, my wife's book club (most appropriately called the Big Readers Book Club) had this item on the list for November and I decided to play along.  It's always a bit of toot toot to read the silly books they choose (last month it was some insipid tripe by their old favorite Jeffrey Eugenides) and make snide comments from both ends while sipping barley wine or (in this case) winter warmer.    In any case, this book looked more promising than the normal Big (and I do mean BIG) Readers Book Club fare based on the historical aspect and magic (Hoppy loooooves doing magic tricks).  Unfortunately, I was to be disappointed once again.  This is a big book (something like 800 pages) and as is often the case with such things, is in serious need of an editor.  I foolishly expected some good characters and development (based on size), but was instead treated to shallowness (something I'm surrounded by at work, so I do recognize it) and longwinded paragraphs full of misssspelllings.  I don't like that.  And I didn't like all the footnotes.  Fraser does this and as much as I enjoy his novels (they are very good), I don't like the footnotes.  As for Johnny Strangelove, I liked some of the happenings on page 137, but not much else.  I can't recommend this.  Even for Book Clubs.  I had no fun.  None.  I did get some good sleep though.  After the winter warmer.  Sorry.  Sleepy.  HHD.	2004-11-23

The writing is clever and results in more than a few chuckles (although the mystery and solution is fairly average).  I must admit, this was a gift from my mostly illiterate spouse or I otherwise wouldn't have read it.  For once, I'm glad for the old hen because I enjoyed this book.  Didn't much care for her pithy inscription though (\\"I mean it, Love Bess\\").  Nevertheless (and as is the norm), the last laugh was on her when I changed the That to Those and added an s to Thing in the title.  A line through her inscription and the replacement \\"I'm talking about your BIG buttocks\\" resulted in yet another book soaring past my regular-sized noggin'.

I won't take sides (it's France's fault!), but there's plenty of evidence in this book for any sentient being to figure it out.  Multiple incidents of French foolishness are documented and it's not all recent.  The book is well researched and not nearly as insulting to the White Flag Warriors as I expected or had hoped.   <br /> <br />Sadly, there is no mention of a disastrous relationship yours truly had when visiting Paris while on the rebound from wife number two.   Her name was Emmanuelle and while I wouldn't exactly call her an enemy, the hair under her armpits, the hard slaps on my buttocks during intimacy, and her refusal to speak English certainly cast the Paris poptart in a suspicous light.  Oh, and she insisted on referring to me as \\"The Cowboy\\" during conversations with her half-drunk friends.  A bad experience all the way around.  This book, however, is top notch and highly recommended.	2004-10-21

Coe writes witty well-crafted books full of odd characters in what's basically a fable told in the form of a mystery wrapped in black humor.  And although that pattern was well established in the first book of his I read (\\"The Winshaw Legacy\\"), it really smacked me upside the head in this book. <br /> <br />\\"The House of Sleep\\" is essentially a love story told in form of a mystery with the denouement slowly revealed in often humorous and occasionally creepy scenes.  There's some political wisecracks and what I think are multiple insults directed against the field of quacks.  Oh, and an absolutely hilarious sentence toward the top of page 259.  I put it to you, this is a fine fine book.  HHD. <br />	2004-09-30

Heck, Heavy Hop Dop was once accused of being a \\"Swift Boat Captain\\" by Blueblood Bettie in the basement of the Tri-Delt House, but that was an outright Kerry.  Anyhow, this book is full of rightly-aimed vitriol and some interesting information about one candidate for the US presidency--with the evidence to back it up.  Not at all like the silly claims of Bettie.  Very enjoyable reading, even if it stirs up some unpleasant memories.  Recommended.	2004-09-11

Taranto and company have provided quite a service in this book.  Presidents are rated based on various (and subjective) criteria by various authors from across the political spectrum (including hot tomato extreme Peggy Nooooonan).  It's hard for me to argue with the ratings since I don't know too much about any of these Presidents although I was delighted to see James K. Polk listed alongside Honest Abe and FDR.  My personal hero (U.S. Grant) never does too well in these lists and I wish Taranto et al. had focused on drinking skills more and leadership less.  Nevertheless, it's a worhty endeavor and the contributions, although subjective, are well rendered and well written.  Perhaps not as informative or amusing as Taranto's excellent BoTW, but an impressive tome to take along to the beach with your favorite picture of (ha, ha) Al Gore (never a president, ha ha ha).

This is a moving story covering something like three or four generations and told from several perspectives--a third generation (I think) 1/8th Sioux, a drunken professor, and back to the Sioux (Dalva).  As is typical of the author, this novel is full of wisdom, beautiful writing, hardship, sorrow, and survival.  I rather liked it--and loved the absence of any sentimentality (or puny-brained felines).  I was a tad annoyed by the rank confusion found on page 319 as to whether or not JWN (a major character) was dealing with a Lt Col or simply a Lieutenant.

What a surprise this book is (much like the surprise I discovered several weeks after my encounter with a different &quot;Margarita&quot;) and I can highly recommend it to one and all.<br />I should warn you now, this is one of those books that requires an imagination as many of the things that occur are out of the ordinary (more like Garcia Marquez or Murakami than King or Carroll).  If that bugs you, stay away.  On the other hand, if you like subversive, metaphor-laden lollipops, this could be your sucker.  It's a crazy ride, and the commentary included with this translation is most helpful.  But nevermind all of that.  What makes this worth reading is the darn cat.  For once, the cat is not annoying.  The black cat in this book (read Ch. XXVIII for example) is very very amusing.  My wife's insipid terror-cat is nothing like this boozehound blackie and that's just too bad.  I tried to get the philistine (Bessie) to read it, but all she did was complain about how unbelievable certain events were (she was particularly offended by how much vodka the cat drank).  No matter, it's a great book and a nekkid redhead even makes an appearance.  Better than most!	2004-05-12

Tom Franklin is quickly becoming one of my favorite authors (and I read A LOT).  I recently gave my brooding, supposedly literate spouse (Bessie) an inscribed copy of Franklin's wonderful short story collection (\\"Poachers\\")--which she quickly (and inaccurately) threw at my throbbing head after finishing the Duane Juarez story--and I was anxious to start on his first novel.<br />I was particularly keen of the title as I thought it'd be fun to bring this book along to Bessie's family week at the beach (her hyper-sensitive parents do not like the word \\"hell\\") since an older person with poor eyesight could easily think I was fitfully reading a book called \\"Hell at the Beach\\".  Ha, ha!  In any event, this book did not disappoint--and it made for great reading.<br />As with \\"Poachers\\", this is gritty Southern writing of the finest degree.  Lots of whisky, lots of guns, backstabbing, double dealing, whore-mongering, and a mystery to boot.  The writing is first rate (I mean no exaggeration when I say Franklin just may be the greatest writer of his generation) and the story moves rapidly, in spite of the descriptive, poetic writing (the mark of greatness to HHD).  This novel is set in the late 1890s and is based on a historical band of vigilantes (or murderers depending on your perspective) and their reaction to a murder of a local politician/merchant.  There is a bit of a mystery involving this murder, but there's little doubt as to what the Hell at the Breech gang is up to.  Franklin skillfully weaves the narration through the story by focusing on four main, flawed characters and reveals each layer of the story in reasonable time and fashion (although the ending felt a little bit rushed) as the reader is transported to a rougher time and place.  A fabulous book in every regard and a loud signal of things to come.  Franklin knows the south and writes beautifully and poetically (perhaps inspired and aided by his talented wife, Beth Ann Fennelly).  BTW, Bessie will not be getting an inscribed copy of this one until her aim improves.  Strongly recommended.  Bravo.  HHD.	2003-08-07

Wow!  First off, Bessie rarely reads anything except diet books.  Secondly, a book about Beer!!!  Well, as is often the case with my angry fifth spouse, I was once again overloaded with misplaced optimism.  This is not a book about some Cave Beer Clan.  Instead, \\"The Clan of the Cave BeAr\\" is an overwrought, overwritten, overblown feminist ode to some silly notion about evolution filled with research and adjectives.    <br />I'll be honest, once I realized it wasn't about beer, I didn't so much read as skim.  Really skim.  I enjoyed the fact that the heroine was blonde with blue eyes, but I didn't like how much the author seemed to be in love with her.  I also grew rapidly annoyed by this author's overuse of adjectives.  It did make skimming a lot easier, but I was still annoyed.  Additionally, while I can relate to the brutish sex-starved male as Cro-magnon stereotype, I didn't particularly find it made for good reading.  I'm still not sure why my brooding spouse is reading it unless it's to reinforce her already firm opinion of me as an apeman.  Or maybe there's a diet somewhere buried within the books 9,142 pages.  Not for me.  HHD.	2003-07-14

Some might believe he's a slooshee made out of Ernest Hemingway, Larry Brown, and Raymond Carver.  These stories will please fans of what the scowling (and snooty) independent bookseller with the \\"Give Peace a Chance\\" t-shirt called 'Oh, Southern GritLit fan are ya' when I dropped it at the cash register.  These are stories about losers, dreamers, boozers, troublemakers, who carry on in the midst of self-imposed turmoil.  I should warn the catlovers of the world (note: I gave a lovingly inscribed copy to Bessie for her birthday and bookmarked the Duane Juarez chapter) that there's a story in which cats (and kittens) get treated in an unkind manner.  Of course, a lot of humans get treated poorly as well.<br />In any case, the writing is fabulous and the title novella is a bit of a chiller.  Great beer-drinking reading and some of the finest writing I've seen in contemporary fiction.  Oh, and a lot of these stories have a hint of humor to them, even in the midst of disaster.  Good stuff and Heavy Hop Dop approves mightily.	2003-06-26

I gave it a go since I wanted to relive the days I spent as Pvt Crapshot Cuddy in the 52nd Tennessee Infantry.  The antagonist in this novel (Steven Armour) does a little re-enacting (he assumes the part of the somewhat devilish character John Trow) in order to escape the quotidian boredom of his homelife and the increasing turmoil of his job (something about selling snacks by using wizards).  Anyhow, I have several complaints about this novel:<br />For starters, I don't like reading about characters whose names I can't be sure how to pronounce (one of the reasons I dislike reading Russian authors).  Is it John \\"rhymes with cow\\" Trow or is it John \\"rhymes with toe\\" Trow.  The author never says and it bothered me.  Secondly, the book drags.  Steven Armour/Trow (I decided to pronounce it Trow as in Cow) isn't a very likable character.  He makes dubious decisions and makes far too much of his trivial problems.  His infatuation with his re-enactment charcter and the belief that he's actually being possessed by him is ridiculous and difficult to buy into.  The surrounding cast is no more likable and the mystery aspect is fairly predictable.  I would've also preferred a tad more Civil War re-enactment scenes and less moping around reading fabricated love letters.<br />On the other hand, I did enjoy some of the conversations and dialogue--the author does have talent.  And when he gets himself a story he'll really be doing something to stand up and shout about.  Also, I liked the interplay between Trow (Cow) and the red-headed vixen who was Trow's chubby commanding officer's very confused wife.  Nothing like that ever happend to Cuddy in the 52nd.  Overall, an average read.  Short on the Civil War, long on fantasy nonsense, good dialogue, decent writing, and a tad slow.	2003-03-26

My wife's very annoying tabby (Bobo!) ran away last October (I've never seen anything move so fast) when I left the front door open while playing the lastest Keith Jarrett cd.  To be perfectly honest, I was kinda glad to see him gone (ecstatic doesn't even begin to describe it), but his disappearance has really been hard on my current wife (Bessie).  She loves cats and her Bobo had been \\"a part of her\\" for almost 14 years (ridiculous).  Obviously, I couldn't imagine replacing Bobo with another cat and neither could Bess (don't get me started).  I've tried several things to try to cheer my distraught girl up (Fur Real Pet, Screensaver for her computer, daily cat calendar, etc.), but nothing has worked (Bobo was a very unique cat).  Until now!!<br />This \\"Cats in the Sun\\" 2003 calendar has brought a smile to my bride's face I haven't seen in the months since Bobo went missing.  The photography is stunning (really)--these Grecian kitty cats are depicted frolicking in romantic settings, climbing all over one another, and exhibiting a playful nature certain to bring a smile to many a catlover.  As an unexpected bonus, I have all but convinced Bessie that Bobo is alive and well in both June and August.  Great stuff.  And best of all, when the month is over, I get the perfect little item to tape over my dart board.  Very Highly Recommended.	2003-02-23

These Gores are wonderful.  And this delightful book is a real eyepopper.  I used to think former VP Gore was a misplaced alien or a very boring robot based on my impression from watching political debates or the nighly news (I am very in tune with current affairs (affairs being an operative word)).  Boy was I wrong.  He and his lovely wife Tipsy (who I heard once had an axe to grind against the heavy metal music industry) have written a book that turns the whole concept of marriage on it's rotund rump.<br />That's right, with the philandering philosophy proffered in this tour de force, I have all the tools I need to convince my schoolmarmish wife Bessie that it's OK to marry just about anyone (or anything)--as long as we're joined at the heart (or anyplace else).  You should have seen her face when I told her I planned on marrying two of my girlfriends from the bar (I'd describe it as incredulous, or perhaps furious).  She'd always turned a blind, angry eye toward my antics (basically, she denied the existence of Roxy, Tiffany, Body-body or any of the girls I see on the sly--this despite overwhelming evidence and my clumsy attempts at subterfuge), but once I confronted her with the unflappable logic of the Gores I knew I was onto something (literally).<br />According to this guide (and that's what it is folks!), the only requirement I need for marriage is true looooove.  And I have a lotta that.  Makes sense to me.  And now that I know it, I plan to act on it.  Of course, the pastor who married Bessie and me has refused my pleas to preside on any additional marriages (some silly thing about God's law).  I tried to get him to marry me and my favorite six-pack (which I truly looove), but he said \\"NO\\".  Well, if only the whole world could see it Al and Tipper's way, there'd be a lot more love to go around.  Think of the love.  Really.	2003-02-15

Books	4	2	36	N	N	I Don't Need to Lose Weight But My Wife Does	And Suzanne Somers' great new book is starting to do the trick!  I've been curious about the Somersizing diet techniques for several years as I've seen Suzanne (better known as Chrissy Snow) making the talk show rounds.  I'll admit I was a little perplexed at first by the Somersize mantra, \\"Fat is your friend and sugar is your enemy\\" and initially thought it was speaking directly to me (i.e., my wife is my friend and my girlfriend's the enemy), but it really sums up Somersizing nicely.<br />Suzanne Somers (the actress, not the dietician) nicely details how mainting a fatty diet and cutting out sugar (and sugar producers) and carbs can remove that fat from your body.  This fine book contains scientific support, health tips, and over 100 recipes (to include desserts) to help slim you and/or your family down.  And it really works.  My wife has lost over twenty pounds (she could stand to lose about 40 more) and I haven't had to suffer through some lousy diet with her--I still get the fatty foods I love and my fatty wife is slimming down.  Kudos to Suzanne!!!  I knocked the rating down to 4 stars simply because there aren't enough pictures of Suzanne flouncing about.  Otherwise, this book is top notch.	2003-01-18

Well, I'm not sure if I agree with that, but the book was an interesting, if not terrific, read.<br />A policeman with the same name as my old nanny (Frannie!) experiences many unusual things in this story.  In fact, this book is not grounded in the real world, so those of you who like novels based in reality will probably want to skip this one.  It veers way south of Murakamiville as the out-of-this-world craziness is pretty much all encompassing.  Some examples:  A three-legged dog shows up, dies, is buried, and shows up alive again.  More than once.  Adult Frannie is visited by a teenaged version of himself (in both the present AND the future).  Aliens abound (ridiculous!).  Time travel mayhem is everywhere and history gets changed.  If you can deal with all of this, you will probably enjoy this novel.<br />It's a fairly engaging mystery wrapped in a tale of love and the bizarreness of life.  Narration is first person and at times both humorous and moving.  I generally liked the story, but felt it a tad too creative, convenient, and otherworldly to really get into.  Still...I did finish it and I told my wife's self-satisfied friend that I loooooved it.	2002-12-04

Anyhow, I picked this one up and read it from start to finish (it took about 7 days).<br />This novel (I suspect the author intended the reader to get more out of it than I did) is focused on grief, overcoming (or rather not overcoming) grief, and friendship.  It's also a bit of a travel novel and makes an attempt to discuss the effects of unwarrented, rapidly obtained wealth.  A summary (note: This is not a spoiler; read on):  Three guys grow up together and are very good friends.  One gets killed in a horrible traffic accident (the fault of a careless trucker).  One (the narrator, Will) comes into a large sum of money (the result of chance--his silhouette is used on light bulb packages).  The other (he is called Hand), is your basic sidekick and a bit of a troublemaker.  The two survivors embark on a fugue of healing--they want to travel the world in seven days.  They have some adventures, do some stupid things, meet some quirky internationals, drink some booze, give all Will's money away, and continue to grieve.  The week ends with separate destinations (they live in different cities) as the narrator heads to a wedding of another friend (the sidekick was not invited).<br />Well, that's about it.  There are some amusing incidents along the way, a few ruminations about the meaning of life, wealth, poverty, chance, death, etc.  None of the insights is particularly illuminating, none of the humor side splittingly hilarious, and I don't have an urge to read it again.  There are some spelling errors (so what) and the writing is pretty good overall.  The description of a beating the narrator took several weeks before the trip is particularly well done.  I'm not sorry I read this book and I can recommend it.  Justdon't expect greatness.  It's average.	2002-11-25

Anyhow, that's why I bought this book. Unfortunately I didn't read the small print beneath the title--this book is NOT about a wife getting fatter, it's a somewhat silly, tongue and cheek, joke of a book about a pregnant wife and the changes she goes through.

This hyphenated author's book on how to think like a cat is, I suspect, of some value.  I purchased it in order to \\"know my enemy\\" as they say.  In my continuing quest to better understand my wife's very annoying tabby (Bobo!), I thought I could improve my chances for \\"success\\" by reading this book.  I was wrong.  What you do get is this:  Lots of cutesy, feel-good feline-psycho-babble that attempts to explain ridiculous cat behavior.  I tend to think the explanation is simple (puny brain).  No matter, this book tries to provide plausible explanations for all kinds of cat antics (particularly those annoying litter box ones) and how to reason with cats and influence their behavior (you might just as well attempt to teach a bear to play the electric guitar).  I tried a few of these conversation-laden techniques in an effort to get Bessie's tabby to try some new \\"tricks\\" and leave the home (for good).  The results have not been encouraging: Bobo is still annoying, my wife refuses to read the book (it would help HER!), and I'm using the litter box.	2002-09-18

To be honest, I originally bought it to rile up my play-it-safe spouse who's always refused to ride bareback and (to be a little more honest) looks a lot like a horse herself.  In any event, I found the book surprisingly charming.  It features twenty-two articles by women about their relationships with horses (all purely plutonic) and includes some thought-provoking insight by the ironic editor following each article.  I could really relate to a lot of the articles (even though I'm a man and don't particularly like horses) as a lot of the feelings I have for my gimpy bulldog (\\"Colonel\\") were portrayed in these women's writings.  I still don't understand my wife's affection for her ridiculous tabby \\"Bobo\\", but I feel enriched for reading this book.  As a bonus, this book is filled with gorgeous watercolors and photographs of women with their horses (no funny business).  All in all, a great purchase.

I bought this cookbook for three reasons. First, my effort to become a vegan met with predictable failure. No matter how I prepared my vegetarian dishes, they still tasted bland and made me feel like the grass-chewing cow I was constantly thinking about eating. Second, I liked the cover of Ted and his eye-pleasing wife Shemaine (coincidently, Shemaine is the name of one of my neighbor's poodles who my bulldog (Colonel) keeps harassing). Anyhow, I liked the cover of those two delightful carnivores posing with their tools of the trade. Lastly, I've been looking for a good game cookbook. I don't do a lot of hunting, but when I do I'm often perplexed about how to prepare the venison (I have yet to kill a bear or some of the more exotic animals for which this book has recipes; as a side note: I believe I can eliminate the duck problem in my backyard and also prepare a delicious dish for my neighbors with plenty of scraps for their new puppies).  This great cookbook covers all the details you need for making a meal out the game you've dispatched and the recipes look delicious and fairly easy to follow.

It doesn't help that I'm a beerswilling carnivore and largely a lazy couchloaf. Also complicating matters is the undeniable fact that my brooding spouse is a horrible cook and routinely serves beef-oriented t.v. dinners or worse (greaseburgers from the local fast food joint).<br />That's where this handy tome comes in. One of the girls from the bar I've been seeing on the sly has been trying to get me to start incorporating more vegetables in our relationship (in addition to the meat) and suggested several books (not this one) to help me get started. While those books had some value, this book really told me what I needed to know about the nutritional values of various vegetarian diets and how to make up for the nutirtion I would be losing by giving up meat.<br />It's very informative, well-written, easy to understand, but somewhat short on recipes. As I've mentioned, Bessie isn't a very good cook--even when she has cook-by-numbers recipes (which basically means, even if this book had recipes it wouldn't be of much value to her) and that's too bad. Nevertheless, this is a very informative book and has surprisingly convinced me that it is possible to maintain nutrition while maintaining an all-vegie diet. Unfortunately, the recipes in this book (and those I found in several others) have failed to convince me that any of these vegie diets taste any better than the leaves and grass in my backyard. <br />As a result, I've scrapped the vegetarian route, started cooking for myself, stopped worrying about my health, and I'm staying away from the girls at the bar.	2002-05-21

I initially purchased this book because it provided information about poisonous plants.  My wife's annoying tabby (Bobo!) has always had a fondness for chewing on plants and I wanted to make certain I knew which ones could cause potential problems.  But dealing with poisonous plants is not nearly the only thing in this book to make it worth recommending.<br />Seazar and Cleo's pet food cookbook is loaded with terrific recipes for my bulldog, Colonel.  The poor little fellow was skin and bones the morning I brought him home after an all night poker game and didn't seem to have much of an appetite.  Chef Barbaro's cookbook has changed all that.  The Colonel now eats three square meals a day and I'm convinced his meals are better than those my frumpy wife puts on the table for me.  In fact, I sometimes think Bessie's performed the old switcheroo on me, but she's not that clever.  Of course, it could just be an honest mistake.  <br />All in all, this is one terrific cookbook.  Recipes are geared toward the delicious and healthy with meals that will get the scrawniest of dogs chowing down and maintaining healthy eating standards.  And don't forget about the plants!	2002-05-10

My tyranical parents bossed Franny around from the onset and treated her much as these authors were allegedly treated by their employers.  It's a shame children have to be raised by employees of their parents, but heck, it could be a lot worse.  And Franny got her revenge when she deflowered me in the backseat of Daddy's Beamer for my sixteenth birthday.	2002-05-08

I can't say whether or not this diet works because I found it too restrictive.  Nevertheless, for someone with more self control than Hoppy, this could be a real gut-saver and it's amusing as well--particularly when you've decided for the 94th time to stop dieting.  Cheers.

I bought this book for my current goddess of the kitchen and she loves it.  Better yet, I looooooove what she's been making.  The author (British hottie Nigella Lawson) writes in a witty and concise manner that seems to be very effective--my sweet housemouse has been cooking up some of the best desserts (pies, cookies, cakes, you name it!) I've had in our two short years of marital bliss when previously the best I could get out of her was store bought snacks and nasty glances.  This book is tops!!	2002-04-26

I brought this fine book home the same day I won \\"Colonel\\" in an all night card game.  Colonel is a three year-old gimpy bulldog, but my safety-first nag of a wife was concerned about how he and Bobo (her annoying tabby) would get along.  I think she suspects I plan on using the Colonel to finally get rid of Bobo (ridiculous).  In order to assuage her fears, I used this excellent book to convince her of my commitment to Bobo's safety.<br />Amy Shojai has created a useful book much in the same vein as the \\"Take Care of Yourself\\" medical books for humans.  Nearly 200 \\"emergency situations\\" are covered (including the essential 'how to handle bites and scratches') for pets, often with innovative techniques.  Even a simple ailurophile like my spouse can follow the instructions provided (the pictures are excellent and helpful as well) and I've become comfortable with the CPR techniques (just in case).  Fear not, there is no mouth-to-mouth involved.  Additionally, small time injuries and problems are covered as well.  But what really makes this book a keeper for me is:  Colonel can stay!!!	2002-04-06

Get real: Burt on Silver and Heat her Busch.  Very offensive.  Secondly, this book is nothing more than some ridiculous pictures of crazy cat-lovin' fools dancing with their (no doubt laughing on the inside) idiotic felines.  What makes this a real trip to loonyville, is this is not a joke.<br />My current spouse was given this book by one of the nattering fools in her cat club and has been dancing around the house dressed up like Alice in Wonderland with her annoying tabby, Bobo.  It is about all I can stand (I have phoned my lawyer).  \\"Dancing With Cats\\" has taken over my home.  The only thing Bessie wants to do is dance with Bobo.  Instead of making my meals and keeping the house clean (and let's not even talk about her appearance), she's busy knitting costumes (she refers to them as catumes) for Bobo and dancing arond the house like Isadora Duncan on a bender.  I'm warning you: if this book finds its way into your home, you're in for some hard times.  I can't tell you how many times I have launched \\"Dancing With Cats\\" into the trash bin, fireplace, out the automobile window, and upside Bobo's puny head.  And each time another appears.  It must be good for sales, but it is very frustrating for me.<br />Crazy catlovers seem to like this book.  Normal, humans, even those who can tolerate cats will find it one of those ridiculous things that points out just how many crazy fools there are in this world.	2002-04-03

I purchased this delightful book for my wife's 14-year old tabby \\"Bobo\\" and he loooooves it.  At his age he's already slowed down a little (I've been trying to get rid of him for years), but he can still whoop it up pretty good--especially when there's a thunderstorm or whenever a train goes by (we practically live ON the tracks).  Well,  thanks to this wonderful book Bobo is now a tame, calm, happy cat and my wife actually thinks I've grown to adore him (I haven't).  Hop-along!	2002-02-26

There are concise comments and honest, useful rankings for just about any beer you will ever run across in your travels.  As you'd expect, this pocket guide is easy to take with you (it's about twice as big as a wallet without all the cash and credit cards stuffed into it) and can serve as a helpful guide when trying to figure out what to order at some of the world's better drinking establishments.  It's broken down by country and that's helpful as well.  I once ordered all the five-star Belgian beers at a pub in Brugge and other than the trouble I got in when I returned to my hotel, this book was a perfect guide for making good decisions.	2002-02-26

This book is witty, charming, and offers some amusing observations about those who spend their lives up in the sky.  In fact, I brought this little tome with me on a flight to Tokyo and my mood was definitely NOT bad.  It was either this hilarious, well-written book or the six \\"drinks\\" I was served in first class.  Like my flight (and the last two drinks), this book is first class.	2002-02-22

There are no actual photographs, the cartoons are reminiscent of cave drawings, and the text is somewhat stilted (perhaps it's the translation) and often hilarious (whether intentional or not).  For those who don't know (and I hope this isn't considered a \\"spoiler\\"), breasts (at least the female version) are useful--particularly for babies.  Lots of babies get milk from a mamma's breast and this book covers the process nicely and with simple words and (even simpler) drawings.  If you want to teach a young child about breasts, this may be the book for you.	2002-02-18

This sugary sweet show has been around for several years now.  Long enough for many misguided souls to create their own \\"unofficial scrapbooks\\" of the lovable (ridiculous) Camden Family.  My kid brother Tripp has created about five of his own Camden (7th Heaven) Scrapbooks.  Non of these are official (and non very good if you ask me), so the title of this \\"book\\" strikes me as a little dishonest.<br />Nevertheless, Tripp bought this book (and I checked it out--Mary Camden is fairly easy on the eye) and it is certainly worth looking into.  Almost 50 pages of candid photos and cute quips with these delightful Camdens is almost more than I can stand.  When you browse this \\"scrapbook\\", you get the feeling you're actually meeting the Camdens (what fun that is!).  Then again, when you realize you've paid almost 25 cents per page you feel a little ripped off (at least I did).  Better to watch the reruns if you ask me.	2002-02-16

I originally purchased this wonderful book in order to aggravate my mother-in-law (not the current one, but my third wife's overly prudish mamma).  She couldn't stand to hear my children (her \\"little boopsies\\") say the innocuous word \\"fart\\" (she prefers the even more innocuous and utterly ridiculous \\"fizzle\\").  <br />Anyhow, I figured this little tome would really get my kids going (and as a consequence, rile up the prim and proper Gooba (her cute, carefully selected Grandmother name).  Well, it sure did!!  My kids (and I) learned more about the natural process of farting than we thought possible.  I can't tell you how much pleasure I derived seeing my youngens sling the f-word at Gooba.  And if their maniacal laughter meant anything, they got a heckuva kick out of it as well. <br />The author is Japanese, but the translation is top-notch.  There are also many hilarious pictures (this book was aimed for 4-7 year olds) as well as clues as to which particular foods will help you get that stench just right (I never had the chance to try this on Gooba, too bad!).  Overall, this book serves many purposes.  It can educate and infuriate.  A winning combination in my book!!!	2002-02-12

He's a good interviewer who doesn't suffer fools gladly or put up with prevarication.  This book, however, is something of a let down.  Sure, there are a few sections where he recounts interview segments and/or comments on celebrities or politicians, but for the most part this book is filled with antecdotes from Bill's life and his alternately witty/smug observations.  These could be interesting but they're smothered by his tendency (at least in this book) to talk down to the reader.  Overall, the book is an easy read, somewhat amusing, occasionally insightful, and entirely preachy.  If you like that kind of thing, check it out.  It was too much for me or too little.	2002-02-06

The Beer Drinker's Bible is just was I've been looking for (and a perfect addition to your Friday Night Bible Study).

And this book only adds to that well-deserved reputation.  <br />Jackson's &quot;Beer Companion&quot; is loaded with color photos of many beer styles, labels, breweries, and watering holes and gives a decent history of the various brewing styles and tastes (very fascinating!).  Mr. Jackson provides advice for what beers go with what foods (and it does matter) and suggests some good drinking establishments (and breweries) to visit if you're a world traveler.  A good drinking companion indeed.  Unfortunately, the book is somewhat large (and annoying to travel with) so you may be better off reading it first, taking some notes, and bringing the (also essential) Pocket Beer Guide with you instead.  Enjoy.	2002-02-06
