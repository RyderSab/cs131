Although it is a novel it is a true account of life in Paris. It is an entertaining pastiche of the best selling A Year in Provence and other such books extolling life in a different culture. The writers love/hate/infuriated relationship with the french is very well written. There are many laugh out loud moments including his afternoon with a Parisian estate agent and his efforts to motivate his less than enthusiastic team about his project to develop Tea shops across France. <br /> <br />This is a lively, fast moving story which can be finished in a couple of sittings. It is not going to influence anybody's view of France of the French. That is not the writer's intention. It is an excellent, light, read. I actually read it in France which gave in an extra je ne sais quoi!  <br /> <br />	2005-06-09

This is another excellent novel from Nick Hornby who has yet to write anything that I have not enjoyed. It is the story of four very different characters. <br /> <br />Maureen is a downtrodden single parent whose life is dedicated to caring for her severely disabled son. Martin is an obnoxious daytime TV presenter who has been the subject of a high profile sex scandal. JJ is a musician who always wanted to be a rock star but now deliver pizzas. Jess is an impulsive teenage tearaway. It is hard to imagine a group with less in common.  <br /> <br />What does bring them together is a tower block - Toppers House - in London on New Years Eve where each arrives intending to leap to their doom. They inevitably discuss what has brought them there. I must say that I feared that they would understand each others pain and then hug each other living happily ever after in a community. But they don't. In fact whenever I thought I knew where it was going it went off in a different direction. Never predictable and never dull.  <br /> <br />They are certainly not a likeable bunch. Why else would they be at Toppers House in the first place? But they are a fascinating group of oddballs and their mutual dependency is both touching and amusing. The subject matter is never trivialised even though there are several laugh out loud moments. The writing is always excellent. Watch out for Maureen's discovery of Nick Drake's music. That is a real `waterworks' moment.  <br /> <br />Don't be put off by the gloomy subject matter. This is his best to date and should not be missed.  <br />	2005-06-08

I was half expecting something to do with the domestic life of a Marty McFly type adventurer. It could not have been more different.<br /><br />Audrey Niffeneger has written a beautiful, and sometimes disturbing, novel about love and marriage, expectation and loss and the power of memories. All of this is seen against the back-cloth of Henry's bizarre disability which causes him to be propelled spontaneously through time. He may go forwards or backwards - normally to a time that has been significant in his life. This normally involves visits to various stages in the life of Claire. This is the real power of this novel as we see the development of their relationship which is, to say the least, chronologically, unusual.<br /><br />There are moments of real humour as Henry never knows where, or when, he may appear next. But there is always a lingering sense of fear. That one day he may not return. His own knowledge of his own future adds to this.<br /><br />The story is narrated by Henry and Claire in short sections. The characters are well written and likeable throughout. I found it impossible to put down from page one. A rare achievement. This is a great book and deserves the praise it has received here.	2005-05-02

This is a remarkable boook about a remarkable year.  <br /> <br />Did so much really happen in the course of 12 months? This was the year of student riots in USA, France and Poland, Mexico. The war in Vietnam moved to a different level. There was war in Biafra and Soviet tanks in Prague. The Olympics were in Mexico and highlighted by Bob Beaman's sensational leap and Tommy Smith/John Carlos' equally memorable demonstration of black Power on the winner's rostrum.  <br /> <br />And then there was the assassination of Martin Luther King followed by that of Bobby Kennedy.  <br /> <br />Mark Kurlansky has written an account of this year which is difficult to put down. He tells the story of these events and introduces us to the major players by reference to written and sources and interviews. He tries to get to the bottom of why the world exploded in that year and concludes that it was spontaneity rather than conspiracy.  <br /> <br />This is one of the best non fiction books that I have read and certainly the best read of 2005 so far. For anyone interested in modern history and culture it must not be missed!	2005-04-09

On the face of it not much happens. It is about one Saturday in the life of Henry Perowne, a renowned neurosurgeon. He wakes early and thinks he sees a terrorist act unfolding. He drives to his Saturday squash game and is involved in a very minor collision. He thus encounters the disturbing Baxter. He plays his game of squash. He buys some fish. He visits his mother and goes home to cook dinner for his family, his beautiful lawyer wife, his blues guitarist son, his daughter who is an aspiring poet and father in law who is a fading poet. That's about it. Until Baxter imposes himself, muscling in on their intimacy.  <br /> <br />What makes it so readable is the richness of the characters. Perowne dominates every page. We see him struggle with his tendency to view those he meets for a neurosurgical angle. So the tragedy of his mother is explained in terms of what is happening to her grey matter. Baxter too is seen as a potential patient as much as a threat. His daughter Daisy is passionate and literary and constantly encourages him to read. This leads them to a brilliant argument about the rights and wrongs of the Iraq war.  <br /> <br />The Saturday in question is the day of the great anti- war march in 2003. It is not a book about the march. The march is a backcloth. It is going on throughout the book - affecting traffic, attitudes and relationships. Ian McEwan does not judge on the rights and wrongs of the war. He is more concerned to show us how the differing attitudes affect his characters.  <br /> <br />I have become a McEwan convert. I was not impressed by Amsterdam. Enduring Love was a powerful and disturbing read. The similarity is that we see the intrusion of a disturbing figure into the domestic world where he does not belong. This is a more relaxed read than Enduring Love but equally recommended. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-03-26

The writer here is a young Argentinian medical student - not the revolutionary who was to become world famous as Che within ten years.  <br /> <br />He is a surprisingly good writer. The images of South America are beautiful. He observes and comments on the injustices that he encounters. These are the early hints of what was to come. Especially powerful are his encounters with leprosy sufferers. But there is also a fair share of humour as the two young man get into a series of scrapes as their money and luck regularly run short. <br /> <br />This is the best non-fiction that I have read for a long time.

It is the simple story of an 85 year old fisherman. He has lost his luck, his young helper and his respect. He goes out to sea, alone, and encounters a huge Marlin. The rest of the story is about what happens. The language is economical and clear. The developing relationship between the old man and the great fish is gripping. The ending sends shivers down the spine.<br /><br />It has been said that Ernest Hemingway is at his best with short stories. This is more of a novella but a great example of concise writing. I would not normally be drawn to a story about a man and a fish but am so glad that I did not miss this one.	2005-02-21

It was the worst piece of pretentious drivel that I have read since....?  The novel is narrated by VGL who is a 15 year old who becomes a scapegoat for a school massacre carried out by his friend who killed himself at the scene. <br /> <br />Other reviewers have criticised the bad language. In fact that was one of the few things that didn't irritate me. You would  expect this from the mouth of a rebellious teenager. The main problem was that I didn't seem to be listening to a young narrator but to the novelist being smart. At one point he observes an old man whose skin 'hangs down in his pockets...erosion caused from waves of diappointment' Oh please! <br /> <br />Apart from the writing the characters simply got on my nerves. I was struggling to find one likeable person. By the end I did not really care what happened to Vernon so long as it was over quickly. <br /> <br />I am in a minority. Others love this book - not least the 2003 Booker Judges! But we can't like everything.	2005-02-21

Nor can he free himself from Jed - a co-rescuer who forces his way into his life.  <br /> <br />McEwan brilliantly tells the story of the disintegration of Joe and Clarissa's normal relationship in the face of extremely abnormal events. This is a disturbing novel but so brilliantly written that you cannot walk away from it - a bit like Jed himself.  <br /> <br />The novel begins with one of the most gripping and disturbing opening chapters that I have ever read.

In Dead Famous we had a murder in a Big Brother house. Here we have a series of murders linked to Friends Reunited. He manages to weave a good tale and also to satirise the craze. <br /> <br />There is some graphic violence that might put some people off although it is not gratuitous and in many ways essential to the story. <br /> <br />He also introduces us to a new character in DCI Newson with the tantalizing hint that there may be more.

Rumpole has been a friend for most of that time. He is one of the great English eccentrics. He will only ever Defend. He drinks Chateau Plonk at Pommeroy's Wine Bar in Fleet Street. He has no respect for judges or other lawyers but great respect for the Timpson family - a dynasty of villains who have been in his care for generations. His knowledge of law comes a long way behind his knowledge of bloodstains and gunshot wounds. <br /> <br />In almost every story we are reminded of his greatest triumph - The Penge Bungalow Murders - but never know the full story, before now. John Mortimer takes us back in time, to the early days of Rumpole's career to tell us what we have all waited to hear. And he does not disappoint. Rumpole is at their very best in this entertaining murder mystery. All of the favourite characters are here including the wonderfully archaic British Legal system. For Rumpole fans this is a must. For any new readers I will guarentee a delightful read that will send you on a journey through the whole back catalogue. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-01-02

Eddie is in his eighties when he is suddenly killed in a fairground accident. His life has never amounted to much. He has worked most of his life looking after rides on a fairground pier. His T.

He comes across those he has loved and hated together with those he has never met - but who have been affected by him. He learns that nothing is insignificant or unimportant.

She is a gifted pianist. At one level it is the story of their love - lost and re-discovered. There is however far more than that to Vikram Seth's brilliant novel. His characters are so well described that I began to feel their emotions. And it is the emotional intensity that makes this book so remarkable. I have rarely read anything as powerful. I felt a mixture of annoyance with and sympathy for both characters at different times. <br /> <br />This is set against a back-cloth of London, Vienna and Venice. But most of all there is the music. This is central to the novel. There is barely a page in which you cannot hear Schubert, Bach or Beethoven in the background. This is not a comfortable book. But it is unmissable nonetheless.  <br /> <br />I recently read Seth's A Suitable Boy. These are probably the two best reads of 2004 - and amongst the best ever. <br />	2004-10-06

My only regret is that I did not read it earlier. It is the story of Lata Mehra's search for a suitable husband - or rather her mother's search for an acceptable match. It is set against the back-cloth of post independence India and the political turmoil of the early 1950s. Some readers have found the length of the novel daunting at about 1500 pages. But it is so well written that each page can be savoured. I actually found myself reading more slowly than usual; such was the sheer pleasure of getting to know the beautifully crafted characters.  <br /> <br />The star of the show is certainly the manipulative but good intentioned mother Mrs Rupa Mehra - `You too will marry a boy of my choosing.' She is surely one of the great comic creations of modern literature as she will stop at nothing to ensure that she gets the son in law of her choice. And who will this be? The Lover? The Poet? Or the man with the very annoying shoes? Vikram Seth keeps us waiting until the very end before ending - or in my case extending - our agony!  <br /> <br />The political setting is fascinating and interesting. The Hindu/Muslim tension is sensitively portrayed. But it is the wonderful array of characters that I really loved. The eccentric and brilliant Chatterji's whose children communicate in couplets. The Politician and former Independence hero Mahesh Kapoor and his troublesome younger son. And so it goes on. <br /> <br />This is one of the best books I have ever read and I would recommend anybody to set aside the time. It is a joy not to be missed. <br /> <br />	2004-09-16

It is not really  detective novel. Indeed anyone expecting this might be disapppointed.<br />It is a lovely portrayal of Botswana life. The pace is gentle. The humour is gentle and the characters are beautifully portayed.

It lived up to all I had ever heard. The hero (?) Yossarian is desperate to get away from the insanity of war. The Catch is that he cannot convince the authorities of his madness because anyone wanting to get away from the war must be sane. This is the thread, which runs through the book. In the process we meet a host of bizarre, comic and tragic characters. There is the brilliant Major Major Major who will only allow men to come in and see him when he is out. In fact the higher they go the madder they get - Cargill, Cathcart, Dreedle and the wonderful Scheisskopf whose dream is to put his men in a parade. But for me the genius of the book is in the creation of Milo Minderbinder who manages to turn the war into an unrivalled business opportunity. Throughout the book there is the haunting spectre of Snowden - what really happened to him.<br />I cannot imagine that there is a more entertaining, more gripping and more powerful account of the insanity of war. Nobody should go through life without reading this.	2003-12-23

There have been so many new Christian trends or fads in recent years that my expectations were low. Was this another Toronto event or some new revival that was going to change the world, as we know it? I had followed those trends with great enthusiasm and lingering disillusionment. All of which is why this excellent little book was devoured in a few hours. <br />It is the semi-fictitious story of a burnt out pastor and his relationship with an intellectual maths teacher. Through their conversations we are led to question all that we have taken for granted about our faith. It is disturbing and challenging to see that much that we take for granted about the bible, evangelism, heaven and hell etc is coloured by our modern worldview and needs to be revisited in a post-modern world. <br />Our traditional division - conservative v. liberal, is set in a different context - `wouldn't I rather be a liberal who really cared about God's will than a good conservative evangelical who was smug in my understanding, who had stopped `hungering and thirsting and thirsting after righteousness.'' I did not agree with everything. But I certainly came away with some fresh thoughts and a desire to reconsider the heart of my faith. And I certainly found myself surprised by what I did agree with. This will not give you the frothy short-lived lift that is a weakness of many Christian books. Neither, on its own, will it change your life. But it raises issues that cannot be ignored. Maybe I should review it again after a re-read in a year or so.	2003-12-13

Nobody really doubts that there are many people who hate America so why do we need another book to tell us. But I was glad to be proved wrong. This is a careful study of the cultural and historical events that have shaped America and in turn shaped the perspective of non Americans. Best of all it tackles why both sides struggle to understand the other. The authors explore the history of the Wild West and claiming of territory with its consequent violence. They look at the influence of TV and film in creating the understanding of American identity and the American way. So films like Rules of Engagement are seen as portraying Arabs as intrinsically violent and Americans as intrinsically good. They also reveal the danger of Americans seeing themselves as the world so that nothing else counts. Hence the re-making of films with American heroes and having a World Series in a sport only played in America. <br />Although the focus is on the USA it is also a timely challenge to all of us in the West. The aim is not to attack Americans but to try to encourage understanding. It is notable that the final words of the book are from the prayer St Francis of Assisis'. This is an interesting and provoking read which I would recommend.	2003-10-27

I have read it every couple of years ever since. It has always been one of my favourite all time books. Is it a childrens' or a grown up's book. Who cares? It speaks to everyone.<br />It is the simple tale of a pilot who is grounded in the desert and meets the enigmatic Prince who has come from another planet. A tiny planet inhabited by the Prince and his beloved flower - and the constant fear of Baobab trees which could overwhelm everything. It is so small that he once watched 44 sunsets. He watches these when he is sad. How sad he must have been on that day observes the narrator. It is a beautiful story about friendship. We laugh as much as we cry. The author's drawing of the empty landscape after his friend's departure still chokes me.<br />But there is also the humour. Normally at the expense of our bizarre adult world. The Prince meets a merchant who sells a pill that means there is no need to drink. This could save several minutes each day. The Little Prince observes that if he had that time he would go to a fountain and have a nice cool drink.<br />St. Exupery is much loved in France. He was even on the money before the Euro arrived. This is much deserved for this little classic alone. Read it in English or French or whatever you like. But read it - now.	2003-07-28

Only Bill Bryson could write a classic from touring some dull British Towns on public transport. Mind you the book is as much about his dry wit as the places he visits. Some of the lines are immortal e.g. -'Blackpool illuminations are nothing if not splendid..and they are not splendid,' 'The day I arrived in Liverpool they were having a litter festival'. My own favourite comes when he tells us that Bradford's role in life is to make all other towns seem attractive - '..and it does it rather well.' <br />I first read this whilst waiting for a horribly delayed flight and regularly laughed out loud to much embarassment.

She returns from Paris to find that little has changed. Her father remains locked in his own silent world. The rivalry between families in her home village of Les Salants is as strong as it has been for decades. The village itself still lives under the shadow of the more affluent La Houssiniere.<br />Her efforts to drag the village out of its defeatism have little support apart from the enigmatic Flynn. Who is he?<br />Against this backcloth we have Joanne Harris' usually brilliant evocation of the senses. You can feel the sand between your toes and the sea breeze in your face. You feel like shaking these characters out of their shells. You want to take the next ferry to a remote French Island. This is certainly her best since Chocolat. Maybe better.	2003-02-09

Her original use of language, wit and ideas are a breath of fresh air and she deserves to be read for this alone. White Teeth was my favourite read of 2001.<br />She displays all of her talent in this second outing. But it was still a bit of a disappointment. Much of the storyline seemed pointless and it fizzled out rather than ended. The characters - so strong in WT - are a bit shallow. Alex began to get on my nerves by the end. As he struggled to find his identity I found the book had the same problem. Or perhaps I'm being goyish.<br />But for all that I couldn't put it down and she is a genius - so four stars anyway.	2003-01-10

It had much of the formula used in Man and Boy - the emotion, the humour, the eastern flavour. But it did nothing for me. I found it hard to get close to any of the characters. It deals with the difficult subject of loss - but never quite gets there. In fact it began to get on my nerves after a while. <br />Having said all that I still read in two days. It isn't boring. Maybe it just isn't a holiday read.	2002-11-16

But does that mean he is any good? Yes it does. Yancey pulls no punches with his portrayal of the lack of grace so often found in the church. He honestly shares his own search for real grace.<br />As ever he uses compelling illustrations from art, literature, cinema and his own experience. He never loses touch with his theme - grace is illogical, scandalous - amazing. It is encouraging and challenging. This is a landmark book.	2002-11-15

This was. Much more has been written about the 'ism' than the man. This is a fascinating insight into his life, his poverty, his exile, his contradictions as well as his thinking. <br />What was most noticeable was the remarkable loyalty of Engels - friend, ghost-writer and benefactor - who even became a stranger in a strange land (Capitalism) to help finance publication of Marx's ideas, often in the face of staggering procrastination by the latter.<br />This is a very readable account of the life and carbunkles of one of the last century's most influential figures.	2002-11-15

At last we now have a studied and sympathetic analysis of their faith and their struggles.<br />Steve Stockman takes us on their journey from The Shalom Fellowship and near abandonment of their musical lives to meetings with the Pope, World Leaders and the magnificent All That you Can't Leave Behind. We see U2 as artists who have taken their faith and doubts where few other Christians could have dreamt. Why is it that they would have more been accepted if they had performed overtly christian material to entertain exclusively christian audiences? For the answer you should read this book.<br />It is not a complete biography. It doesn't pretend to be. But it does give a real insight into the World's Greatest and probably least understood band.	2002-07-15

The best place is in Southern France in the heat of the day, over a bottle of Chateauneuf du Pape. On rainy afternoons in Liverpool, something is missing. <br />In this latest book he tours France visiting various festivals related to particular foods and wines. Frogs - with remarkable thighs in Vittel, Chickens in Bourg en Bresse with perfect colouring - Red, White and Blue of course, Wine in Beaune, Scantily clad women in St. Tropez (?). They are all here. They are described with his usual humour and observation. If you love food, wine or France this is for you. If not you may become a convert.<br />A nice holiday read.	2002-07-03

Doctors seem to speak a language beyond our comprehension. Oliver Sacks takes us into his world where we feel immediately at home. He writes of real people and gives us a fascinating, if disturbing, insight into the paradoxes of the human mind.<br />For me the most moving story is 'The Last Hippy'. Greg lost his immediate memory following a massive cerebral tumour. However many times you see him it is always a meeting of strangers. They go to a Grateful Dead concert. Greg is once again a fan. He shouts cheers and sings. Next day the whole experience has gone.<br />We also read of the Tourette's syndrome sufferer whose tics disappear whenever he begins work - as a surgeon. There is the artist who sees only black and white, the autistic/artistic genius.<br />This is a gem of a book which deserves to be read over and over. You will learn something new every time.	2002-03-05

This is a studied and thoughtful account of the early years of Tony Blair's New Labour Government - following eighteen years of Conservative Rule. He takes us behind the personalities who had shown unity at all costs as Labour fought desperately to regain power.<br />We gain an insight into the minds of the major players. Who is in and who is out. The power struggle is played against the background of major events - The Northern Ireland Peace Process, Kosova etc. In particular he gives a real insight into the rivalry and dependancy of Blair and Chancellor Gordon Brown. A fascinating insight into the working of Government.	2002-03-02

It is concise and very readable within a few hours. But is also an epic covering almost sixty years in the life of Framboise. We see her as strong willed child and bitter old woman. On the way we have the usual Joanne Harris fare of sensuous descriptions of food, landscape and characters. <br />Much of the book is set in wartime occupied France as three bored children become infatuated with the German Tomas Liebnitz who manipulates them and others in the small village of Les Laveuses. Suspicion, jealousy, intrigue, mystery - they are all here. This novel is darker than Chocolat and a must read.<br />Harris' other acheivement is to come up with so many characters named after fruits - Framboise, Cassis, Pistache, Noisette, Prune, Peche ....	2002-02-18

As someone brought up in Liverpool in the sixites I lived and breathed them  - almost as much as Everton FC. I knew about their lives their schools, their houses. I owned all the albums and singles - all now neatly replaced by CDs.<br />Macdonald gives us the music. A track by track journey through 186 recorded songs. When it was written, recorded, released. What was going between the Fab Four at the time. We even find out what happened between 3:25 - 3:27 mins on Revolution 9 on the White Album. <br />It is also a fascinating and nostalgic review of the sixties and the influence of the Beatles on life and culture. <br />An ideal evening in - glass of wine, box of chocolates, Abbey Road on the CD Player and this book giving you the run down on every moment.	2002-02-07

I picked the book up on holiday and read a couple of pages - the first chocolate slowly popped into the mouth. Next day and two sittings later it was finished. A thoroughly enjoyable experience.<br />Vianne Rocher dances across the pages - a mysterious outsider, always on the move, always on the run. From what? 'Are we staying here?' asks her daughter Anouk as they arrive in the quiet French village where life is quiet, predictable and dominated by the local church.<br />She opens a chocolate shop in Lent, immediately invoking the wrath of Reynaud, the Priest whose insecurites about his faith and influence eat him away as much as his lenten fasting.<br />The confrontation is inevitable as Vianne plans a chocolat festival at Easter. The conclusion mixes comedy and tragedy as Reynaud's 'weakness' brings his downfall. The story line is intersting but it is the characters who shine. Vianne herself is the light which shows the true character of those she meets. The hypocritical Caro, the evil Muskat, the downtrodden Josephine, the wonderful Armande. <br />The book carries a thread of the supernatural. How much does Vianne really know? What powers did her mother have? There is even the slightest hint of Mary Poppins - 'I'll stay until the wind changes'. The wind does change. A 'must read'.<br />By the way there is a very good movie of the same name.	2002-02-07

Essential therapy for anybody who supported the Labour Party through eighteen years the of Conservatives Ruling Britain. We feel that O'Farrell was right there with us as pre-election optimism dissolved into miserable failure again and again and again. <br />Over the years his radical edge is softened by age and cynicism. The vegetarian succumbs to the bacon sandwich. The dedicated capaigner pays the au pair to deliver his election leaflets. The words of the chant have changed - 'What do we want? A winter flowering clematis! When do we want it? Before we lay the patio!' <br />Is it similar changes which made the Labour Party electable again? <br />His description of the unforgettable election night of 1997 is the highlight. The defeat of Michael Portillo described as dramatically as the scoring of a winning goal in the Cup Final. Could we ever get?<br />But did things really get better?	2002-02-07

Fighting for the poor and dispossessed against the wealthy esablishment? Or was he a callous thief and police murderer who deserved all he got? Don't expect to find any answers here. And that is Peter Carey's great acheivement in this novel - a worthy winner of the 2001 booker Prize.<br />It is Ned Kelly's own version of his story, to be read by his child, as a justification for all he did. The case for the defence which was never heard.<br />It is written as if in Kelly's uneducated hand. The poor grammar and structure - 'I said I knew the fault were with the parsing' - make difficult reading for the first page or so. We are soon taken into the mind of this hero/villain as he is drawn by injustice into a world of violence which he never wanted - ' ..all my life all I wanted were a home..'.  Or did he? There are subtle ambiguities in his character, such as his obsessive hate for his mother's suitors, which leave us wondering. It is the character of Kelly which strides across the pages. You will hate the oppressors as much as he did - rightly or wrongly.<br />The best I have read by Peter Carey to date.	2002-01-20

As ever the book wins hands down. Not a light read but enjoyable none the less.<br />It is the writers memoirs of a poor upbringing mainly in Limerick. Does it really rain there contantly? The downstairs of the family is permanently flooded. The loss of siblings is described in a matter of fact way which emphasises its inevitability. <br />It is not all gloom. There are moments of real humour - particularly the first communion where 'The Lord Jesus' becomes stuck in his throat and is subsequently vomited into the back-yard. <br />As this is a memoir it is unclear how much is historically accurate. but it isn't a history book.<br />I would have given it 5 stars but it was depressing in places. Hardly a reasonable criticism.	2002-01-16

As a student lawyer I was impressed his willingness to write directly and honestly about issues so often avoided by the church.<br />In his latest book he explores the lives and works of people who have helped him survive the oppression and hypocracy of some churches he has known. He begins with Martin Luther King - who else? Yancey reminds us of his singleminded determination to see his 'promised land' of freedom for oppressed blacks in 60's USA. His personal failings are not ignored - the bible does not ignore the failings of David, Samson etc.<br />The most moving chapter describes his long acquaintance with Paul Brand who had devoted himself to the care of Leprosy sufferers. Ghandi is included. How often has it been said or written that this frail Hindu stands as the best example in the 20th Century as one who lived as Jesus did? And so we read about this list of men and women who have influenced this influential writer. G.K. Chesterton, Tolstoy, Dostoyevski et. al.<br />When I finished the book I was inspired to come up with a similar list - C.S. Lewis, Bishop Tutu, David Watson, Philip Yancey.......	2001-12-27

It was. <br />We meet the appropriately nick-named 'Odd Bodd' Hopkins, whose appearance is as eccentric as his theological obsessions. Peter Carey explores his relationship with his Plymouth Brethren father. Neither fully admits the love for the other. Odd Bodd's other obsession, gambling, leads him to the equally compulsive Lucinda. From this moment on the novel took on a new dimension for me. The undeclared love, the social repression, the misunderstandings, the emotional gambling left me wanting to cry,laugh and bang their stupid heads together. The most frustrating love story since Remains of the Day.<br />The opening paragraph prepares us for the inevitable tragedy. The finale does not disappoint.	2001-11-06

It comes nowhere to matching the richness of the language and characterisation. And one of the main characters - Carlos is almost completely omitted.<br />It is a wartime story inhabited by real people whose lives are invaded as well as their beautiful Kefalonia. It is a love story - the Captain's insecure love for the doctor's daughter and the hopeless love of Carlos for the Captain. Louis de Berniere shows us the fears and doubts of the invaders as much as the invaded. The Italians are artistic and musical lovers of life and women - far removed from the harsh Nazis who arrive following Italy's surrender. <br />Happiness, sadness, anger, frustration, hate, love - they're all there. It is as good as the hype. In a different league to the film - which I did actually enjoy.	2001-07-27

'Thinking man's Kramer v Kramer' was what I expected. But this is more, much more. Tony Parsons looks sensitively and wittily with the man's contrasting relationship with his son and his own father. Through the pain of losing everything he discovers the true value of relationships. <br />There are many 'laugh out loud' moments. And as many tear-jerkers. The moment the ailing grandfather is visited in hospital by the confused grandson is the key incident for me. Almost led to an embarrasing show of emotion on a flight to London. <br />Deserves all of its praise.	2001-03-10

I picked it up more out of curiosity than anything. By page two I was hooked. <br />ZS has gathered together a fascinating array of diverse characters. We have the sad figure of Archibald Jones who opens the novel trying to escape from life and does the same for much of the novel. He marries the younger and beautiful Clara Bowden who is escaping from her past. Her considerable front teeth have been lost following an unforunate encounter with a tree and a motor scooter. <br />Archie's lifelong friend is Samad Ick-Ball whose marital decisions are made by way of wrestling matches. These four produce the three children whose lives take up much of the rest of the novel. The developing issues of racism, sexism and an experimental mouse (c) keep the novel moving at a fast pace full of wit, pathos and dental similies. But above all it is the characters. Not a pretty bunch. Not a pretty novel. But a definite must read.<br />She had also created a new nown for the English language. Chalfenism. If you want to discover its meaning then you will need to read the book.	2001-03-10

He was writing about Arsenal whereas the source of my joy and pain since 1966 has been Everton. But apart from that I saw myself on every page. It was quite liberating. Was I the only intelligent professional English male who felt sick on matchdays, and worse when we were playing Liverpool? No. Was there any rational explanation for my total refusal to listen to a game on the radio because this will guarantee a heavy defeat? Yes. We are all in this together.<br />Nick Hornby's books are always witty and engaging. But most of all he is able to communicate the male psyche to an unbelieving world. (See also High Fidelity). It's OK to be male. It's OK to sit in the cold and rain and watch us lose 0-3 to Ipswich Town, knowing that we will be back next week for more of the same. I intend to buy this book as a present for anybody who dares to question my sanity.	2000-11-03

Itself in 1980s Liverpool	I was a newly qualified lawyer in the early to mid 1980's. My first three years wee spent in a Law Centre in inner city Liverpool and then I spent the next eight years in a Legal Aid Practice in the Walton area dealing with many housing law problems. This was a time of political turmoil in Liverpool with the Trotskyist group  Militant Tendency gaining control of the local council and then taking the city into direct conflict with central government. As a non politician who supported the labour party it seemed that the world had gone mad. In particular the politicians seemed to have lost sight of the needs of the people of Liverpool for the sake of scoring political points.<br />Enter Peter Kilfoyle. He was employed by the Labour Party with the brief to bring the Liverpool party back to some form of sanity. This is his account of that struggle. It is often a harrowing story of intimidation, verbal and occasionally physical, of any who opposed Militant. He describes the rise of Militant, and its fall. The latter was completed in the Walton by-election of 1991 when Kilfoyle himself defeated the militant 'Walton Real Labour' candidate.<br />The book is well written and certainly readable. There are occasional hints of the writer's personal dislike of his opponents together with some self justification - but then it is written by a politician.	2000-10-31

Is it possible to treck the length of Britain with no money to spend? On his journey he is welcomed into the lives of surprising array of people including a curate, a couple from a housing estate and a fox hunting community! It gives a fascinating insight into the response of people to the unexpected arrival of a penniless traveller.<br />There haven't been many travel books which I couldn't put down. But this was one. Each day builds up to its dramatic climax. Will he find a bed for the night? Will he be turned away?

In his analysis of this 'race to the top' he presents a vivid picture of the alarming power of these 'super companies.' In this context he introduces the opportunities and dangers of technology and especially e-commerce which is dramatically accelerating globalisation.<br />He then moves on to the dangers and challenges of this new McWorld. He looks at the pressures on young people and their accumulation of debt as they join in the race. He then highlights the plight of the world's poor who increasingly left behind. He uses the example of Ugandan villagers who can no longer afford locally produced fish as the producers have found a higher price from Western purchasers. The local population are left to queue for the scraps.<br />Sine's aim is to challenge Christian leaders to present an alternative to McWorld, based on a concern for the poor and for our environment. He achieves this in a way that is informative and readable. He presents material which is often perceived as dry in a lively and challenging way. <br />I have no hesitation in recommending this book.	2000-05-08
