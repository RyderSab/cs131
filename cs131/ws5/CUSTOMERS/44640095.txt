He had $900 million in 1911. Today that would be worth about $120 billion by some estimates. For this, Rockefeller was hated by journalist Ida Tarbell. Ron Chernow does not subtly avoid talking about the controversy surrounding Rockefeller, but addresses it head on and doesn't give his opinion. It is just the facts. Ron Chernow also spends time talking about Rockefeller's philanthropic efforts. He leaves the reader without any doubts that Rockefeller was the greatest philanthropists American has produced. (Bill Gates is will be close though).  <br /> <br />This book is very detailed (that is why it is so long) and is the best biography I have ever read. It is the best not only because I am a big fan of Rockefeller, but because of the way it is written. Many people give 5 stars to average books, but this really is a 5 star book.	2005-07-24

A previous reviewer said he read that it inspired Bill Gates too. It is no coincidence that Rockefeller, Gates, and Carnegie were the three greatest philanthropists in American history. These men have contributed more to America than 10,000 average people could. The following are just some of the contributions of the above three men: Carnegie Mellon, U of Chicago, Spellman College, Rockefeller University, medical advancements, public libraries, medical aid, art donations to museums, etc. They could have been like J. Paul Getty and hoarded the money, but they chose (or choose) to be great men.  <br /> <br />The book talks about the responsibilities of wealthy people. Wealthy people have the opportunity to help people who don't have much opportunity and Carnegie writes about the responsibility wealthy people have to them.	2005-07-20

I can sum up the book in a few sentences. According to the authors, we are genetically inclined to spend money and avoid saving because our ancenstors didn't have refrigerators. We use drugs because they make us feel good. We take risks because it gives us a little high. We do drugs because they make us feel good.    I had to read this book for a graduate Accounting class. No, I am not joking. I wouldn't have wasted my money, nor my time if I wasn't being graded on it. This book is a bunch of junk theories that say we are genetically induced to do things because of some ancestor and we can change it if we are smart enough. On just about every page in the book is some study done on animals that is supposed to be related to the topic. The author says races have DNA that are almost identical. Yeah, well Chimps and humans have almost identical DNA's. The book also says that 25% of women and 50% of men admit to cheating on their spouse. If you look at the source, you will see it is from 1974 and published by none other that Playboy Press. The book also says 10% of British children tested were not children of their married mother and father. Meaning that the mother had an affair. However, in the notes it says that this 10% only applies to people who were suspicious and actually went and had the test done. That is a pretty importatnt fact they chose to leave out in the text.     This book is a bunch of theories based on animal behavior and the hypothetical behavior of our ancestors. The rest of the book is common sense. Especially the dozen or so pages the authors use to discuss how women like men with money and success. I didn't need a PhD to tell me that.	2005-07-16

They defend these people's \\"anonymous sources\\" and accusations with passion. But what happens when someone writes a similar book about Hillary Clinton? A first amendment \\"scholar\\", whatever that means, says it is libel and they would be sued if it didn't attract attention to the book. Well the book is number 5 on Amazon sales right now. Great strategy! <br /> <br />Is the book fiction? It is probably just as much fiction as Hillary's \\"Living History.\\" I am not a fan of this book or other books that try to smear people.

I have heard about this book a few times but it was written so long ago that I thought it to be obsolete and never purchased it. Recently, my grandmother passed away and I stumbled upon the 1957 edition of Etiquette while searching through her books. I must say that I was dead wrong about the book being out of date. There are some traditions that have since died out, like what to do with hats, but only because the fashion has changed. The rest of the book is still very practical. In the preface to this book Emily Post says, \\"Graciousness and courtesy are never old-fashioned, though their expression does change.\\" <br /> <br />The importance of learning etiquette can be summed up in one quote from the first page of the book: \\"no one--unless he be a hermit--can fail to gain from a proper, courteous, likable approach, or fail to be handicapped by an improper, offensive, resentful one.\\" <br /> <br />While most people think of etiquette in relation to table setting and dinners, it is much more than that. This book guides the reader through everyday good manners and civility.	2005-06-19

Does attacking Bill Cosby for trying to make blacks accountable for their actions help you make money? If Dyson was really looking out for blacks, he would donate all of his earnings from this bogus book to impoverished blacks.     As a businessman, I would not, nor could not, hire someone that spoke broken English. He would embarrass both my company and me. As a parent, I would not buy my child $200 shoes and $80 pants so he can look \\"ghetto fabulous.\\" As a parent I would not encourage my children to adopt the beliefs of drug dealers, theives, murderers, and other criminals (i.e. Hip-Hop artists).     Why is it that the people like Jessie Jackson and Mr. Dyson, who claim to be helping black people, hurt them and get paid big bucks for it? How are blacks better off thinking that whites won't let them succeed? If this were true, how do you explain the success of so many black americans like Condoleezza Rice or Oprah that went from low-income families to two of the most powerful women in the world?     If you want to read a good book on black people and the successes in some areas and lack of success in others, read the new book \\"Black Rednecks and White Liberals\\" by Thomas Sowell (a black Fellow at Stanford's Hoover Institution). He writes that people, like Dyson, that want to respect the \\"black identity\\" are hurting blacks, not helping. He also explains that the \\"black identity\\" was evolved from simpleton white people from England, who were known as crackers and rednecks. Why would blacks want to keep and embrace the very thing that is holding them back? If they don't embrace the \\"black identity\\" then people like Dyson call them Uncle Tom or white boy.     Dyson attacks Cosby for incorrectly stating that blacks have a 50% dropout rate in some cities. Some reviewers of this book cite this as evidence that the message Cosby is trying to get out is invalid because he exaggerated a statistic. The truth is that according to 2000 National Center for Education Studies statistics, whites 18 to 24 had a 91.8 percent high school completion rate and blacks only had a 83.7 percent completion rate. That means 8.2 percent of whites didn't complete high school versus 16.3 percent of blacks. That means twice as many blacks between 18 to 24 didn't complete high school as whites the same age. Even if Cosby's stats were wrong, the evidence is still there that he was right that the black community has a huge problem with education.     Ask yourself these questions: would blacks be better off or worse off if they stopped by $200 shoes and $80 jeans? Would blacks lose or gain by avoiding hip-hop music? Would you hire someone that didn't speak proper English? Would you go to a doctor or lawyer that didn't speak proper English? Do you think Dyson and Jesse Jackson are helping black people or exploiting them for money?	2005-05-12

Like most liberal books, this book just reinforced my conservative beliefs. It is true that stats and facts do not lie. However, one can easily use facts and stats to draw illogical conclusions--or ones that support their vision. For example, one can say the U.S. is much more dangerous than Canada because it has many more murders than Canada and use facts and stats to back it up. However, any elementary school student can see that if you have 9 times more people in the U.S. you are likely to have more murders in the U.S. Even though elementary school students can see the flaws in arguments like these, some of Michael Moore's followers cannot. The murder rate would be a much better statistic (which is higher in the U.S.), but you must also include other violent crimes to come up with a reasonable conclusion.     Surely one can say blacks and hispanics are stupid, asians are the smartest, and whites are in between. One can use household income, education level, aptitude tests, crime rates, or other stats to back up these claims. However, one thing that economists and statiticians teach is that correlation is not causation. Just because there is a correlation does not mean that one causes the other. The black scholar (I included the black part because he would be labeled a racist for talking about black people in a book if he were white) at Stanford's Hoover Institute, Thomas Sowell, wrote a new book, \\"Black Rednecks and White Liberals,\\" that makes a strong case for culture being the main difference between successful people between races and within races. Most people agree that blacks and hispanics are not intellectually inferior to whites, and whites are not intellectually inferior to Asians. However, one can manipulate stats and facts to \\"prove\\" that the difference between races are because of differences in intellectual capabilities. This is what Michael Moore does in a similar fashion with his \\"facts\\" and stats.     There are those that say Michael Moore is controversial and provides a different perspective and for that he is a great contribution to the intellectual arena (like Hollywood, the media, and liberal professors). However, I somehow suspect that those same people will not say the same for Rush Limbaugh or Ann Coulter. This book is in no way objective and is borderline fanatical.	2005-05-06

Nobel Prize winner Gary Becker helps fill this void in economics. Although I found some of his solutions to social problems too simplistic, it is an interesting read and it is sure to get you thinking. I personally like the books organization and structure. It is a composition of Becker's columns in Business Week and each column is about 1.5 pages. I liked this book because when I sit on the toilet I can get through a column or two.

Filled with historical facts and observations, he shows how a company with 10% earnings growth is often a better investment that a company with 20% earnings growth. The reason for this phenomenon can be summed up in one word--valuation. Fast growing companies are expected to grow and that is taken into account in its price. Slower growing companies are expected to grow slow.  <br /> <br />Professor Siegel shows how some of the best performing stocks in the past half century were companies with good dividends and earnings above expectations. He proves his point by comparing Standard Oil of New Jersey and IBM. IBM has grown faster than Standard Oil of New Jersey by any measure, except stock appreciation. <br /> <br />Professor Siegel also explains how fast growing sectors are not always good investments. Obviously, technology stocks in 1999 and 2000 were fast growing, but some of the worst investments you could have made. He also uses the Financial sector as an example. It has been one of the two fastest growing sectors in the past 50 years, but the stocks within the sector have not performed as well as the S & P 500. The reason this is possible is because new companies enter the business. These new companies bring competition and make the sector bigger, but not more profitable. <br /> <br />This book is great for any beginning investor or any professional.	2005-04-25

Although there are dozens of books that are written about him, this is the only book in Buffett's own words. This collection of Buffett's writings on different topics come from his annual reports. It is true that you could go to the Berkshire Hathaway website and look at the annual reports yourself, but not everyone wants to flip through 15 annual reports. Moreover, this book is organized by topic and not by year, unlike the annual reports.  <br /> <br />This is an invaluable for both investors and managers. I emphatically recommend this book to CFOs, investment bankers, financial analysts, and anyone else interested in corporate finance and business valuation.  <br /> <br />For those people that wish to learn about Buffett's philosophy this is the book to read.

The author is also a little redundant in his writing. He spends a lot of time talking about the different types of funds available, but not actually giving that much insight into how they are run.     This is a good book for someone like myself that has very little prior knowledge about hedge funds, although it could have been written better. There are many misprints, yet the organization is good.     The most rewarding parts of the book are the questions at the end of each chapter. The answers are provided at the end of the book and many of the Q & A's give you more insight into hedge funds than the actual body. This is a good book for someone with no knowledge of hedge funds but would be too simplistic for someone that has already has knowledge of them.	2005-03-04

When most people think of Charles Schwab, one of the biggest names in finance, they think of investing in equities. However, Schwab has chapters on mutual funds, fixed-income securities, and taxes. He talks about how to get started in investing, the importance of it, and how to invest to meet your goals and needs.  <br /> <br />I use his services to manage my family's portolios online and it is cheaper than other services, unless you are a day trader. Other services require a minimum amount of trades per month, that is how they charge less for their trades. Schwab's services are ideal for anyone managing their IRA. You also get free S & P stock reports for companies, which gives you all of the historical data you need to make a wise decision. The previous reviewer didn't review the book, he reviewed the policies at Charles Schwab. If you are investing less than $10,000 and are trading more than a few times a year, taxes and transaction fees are going to eat up your returns no matter what. And since when is having $10,000 in savings rich? <br /> <br />This is a great book for beginners and people who need some guidance with respect to their retirement investments.

He accuses Ford of helping Hitler, \\"Hitlers's ability to cite such a prominent figure as having views similar to his could only have helped him.\\"  <br /> <br />I have only red the chapters on the first three men and I am not sure if I am going to read the rest. This book should be titled \\"psychology of giants of enterprise\\" rather than \\"seven business innovators and the empires they built.\\" The author barely talks about there actual business and ignores there philanthropy. Except for Carnegie in which he said, \\"Before we can understand how such a shrewd man could transform himself into a clown, it is worthwhile contemplating how Carnegie lived...\\" Talking about Carnegie's desire to promote peace \\"He was worse than a failure; he was a fool.\\"  <br /> <br />The chapter with Eastman opens on his suicide and then he tries to explain why he committed suicide.

This is pure nonsense.  <br /> <br />The two authors go through a detailed explanation of why the U.S. is better off now than it ever has been. Some of the critics of this book say that we are doing so well now because of government programs. Well how do these people explain the success of the U.S. before FDR and Johnson. The Great Depression is also proof that the government shouldn't meddle with a capitalist society.  <br /> <br />This book should be read by anyone who hears the media's and polticians'spin on the welfare of the U.S. The U.S. is still the most powerful economic giant in the world and the facts are there to back it up. Some people can spin some stats to show that we are not doing as well as we think, but it is just spin and I truly believe that these people just want the U.S. to be less powerful because they dislike the success of our country.	2004-10-26

I wanted to explore other ways of creating income. However, I was greatly disappointed. Advising average people to invest in options is terribly dangerous. If professionals with Ivy League MBA's can't do it without getting hit hard sometimes, what makes Robert Allen think average people can do it? Getting involved in options is speculation, not investing. He quotes Buffett and says we should learn from him, but then he advises to do the very things that Buffett says not to: options, short term trading, etc.     Moreover, Mr. Allen absolutely appalled me with his arrogance. He brags about how much money he has made and how much he gets from his businesses. He also advises a networking plan that strongly resembles pyramiding. At one time he says he earns a few dollars for every word he writes, and then writes a few lines of blah blah blah and quotes how much money that just brought him. I didn't find his hubris amusing.     He said that he has made more people millionaires than Warren Buffett. Really? How did you do that? Warren Buffett makes people millionaires and billionaires, yes billionaires, by running a company they own stock in. Warren does the work and they sit back and get rich. Does Robert Allen do the work for the people he claims he makes millionaires? No, all he does is help them get motivated. He probably hasn't made anyone a millionaire except for himself by selling these books. Just because someone read your book Mr. Allen, or did a program you charge $5000 for and became a millionaire by their own toil, does not mean that they wouldn't have become a millionaire if they hadn't read your book or done your overpriced program.     I think that this book doesn't have any real value outside the first few chapters that talk about personal finance. However, there are much better books on this topic. I wouldn't waste my time on this book if I were you. It is way overrated.	2004-05-15

This is a book of wise analects based on the reflections and teachings of Epictetus. I was impressed with the applicability of this book to today's modern world. Epictetus is one of the greatest philosopher's in the sense that you can actually understand and apply most of what he teaches.	2003-12-19
