It's all in pinyin, though in the back there is a listing of all the vocabulary's Chinese characters (traditional and simplified).  There is also a Chinese to English and an English to Chinese glossary.  Each chapter has several sets of exercises with the answers in the back of the book.    The short dialogues that begin each chapter are modern, humorous, and emphasize the sorts of things you would need to be able to say if you were visiting China.  (I'd like to rent a room, Where is the bathroom?, etc.)  There are lots of notes on cultural points like festivals, food, what it's like for American Chinese kids coming to visit the Old Country.  The book is pleasant to read.    Best of all, though, and the main emphasis of the book, is the grammar teaching.  It is very, very clear.  The authors really understand comparative English/Chinese grammar.  A quote is the best way to illustrate this.  From Chapter 9, on a certain type of verb compound (the Chinese seem to pile up one verb after another in a sentence -- one of those mysterious tendencies that drive you crazy when you start studying Chinese):    First they give examples:  \\"Ni ting dong le Yingwen.\\"  \\"Ta kanwan le neiben shu.\\"  Then they explain:  \\"Two independent verbs are sometimes placed together in a relationship of verb and complement to express a more specific kind of activity that either verb could express alone.  In such a compound, the first verb is considered the ordinary verb and generally indicates the major activity being described.  The second verb is regarded as the complement of the first verb and states the result of the major activity;  for these reasons, it is known as the 'resultative complement.' \\"    They then explain the examples:  \\"For instance, the act of understanding, \\"dong,\\" can result from either the activity of listening, \\"ting,\\" as in \\"tingdong\\" (to understand through listening), or the activity of reading, \\"kan,\\" as in \\"kandong\\" (to understand through reading)....\\"    They then proceed to explain \\"tingdedong,\\" \\"tingbudong,\\" etc.    There are also excellent explanations of the uses of that troublesome particle \\"le.\\"    I am presently studying Chinese on my own and am using this book to supplement my main text, John DeFrancis' \\"Beginning Chinese\\" series. I would recommend both of these texts to anyone who is really motivated to learn to speak Chinese properly.  Note:  I took the HSK (Beijing's Standardized Test for Chinese) last year after studying primarily with the \\"Integrated Chinese\\" series and scored -- ouch -- 63, not even good enough to earn a Basic Level 1 Certificate.  Since then, I've switched over to DeFrancis and also am using \\"Chinese: the Easy Way\\" off and on.  In July, when I get my new score, I'll try to add it to this review so you can see if these books really are any good!    Note again:  Well, it's several months later, and I got a 105 this year on my HSK.  That's not bad (I hope) considering I'm only at Ch. 4 in DeFrancis' Intermediate Chinese so my vocabulary is still very small.  I got low scores in both oral and reading comprehension (22 and 26), which I think is because my vocabulary is so poor.  My grammar score was much better, at 57.  (As far as I can figure out, 57 puts me at the 60th percentile;  in other words, the upper half.)  So I'd say my plan of shoring up my grammar foundation by using \\"Chinese: The Easy Way\\" and doing lots of extra translation with the DeFrancis Series is paying off.	2005-02-23

The Nuts and Bolts Website helped me turn a C minus literary criticism paper (I was devastated - I couldn't figure out what I had done wrong) into an A.  My particular problem is structuring my ideas logically and building a solid argument.  This site, along with an hour with a good tutor (\\"No, what you have here is NOT a thesis statement!\\"), and another hour with my eminently logical husband (he's an engineer who works a lot with lawyers) helped me finally understand that I had to, in effect, build a path with brick walls on either side of it, leading my reader along by the hand, rather than wandering all over the countryside to every distraction, expecting my reader to keep up with my desultory ramblings and then find his own way back to the road.  And how to do it. <br /> <br />The site is, unlike me, clear, methodical, and understandable, which is very important when you just can't grasp something because it's in your Writer's Blindspot. <br /> <br />I'm buying the book in case the Website ever goes down.	2004-11-09

(&quot;Beginning Chinese&quot; being all in pinyin.)<br />The above 2 books are the beginning (Mandarin) books in Yale's &quot;DeFrancis Series,&quot; all written by John DeFrancis.  But it's a bit more complicated than that, because in addition to the above 2 texts, there is a third beginning text, in 2 parts:  &quot;Beginning Chinese Reader, Part 1&quot; and &quot;Part 2.&quot;  The &quot;Reader&quot;s aren't transliterations of the texts -- rather, they introduce Chinese characters in a different manner (easiest-to-write characters first, not most commonly spoken words first).<br />If you're thinking of starting to learn Chinese, or you're already learning Chinese and looking for another text because the one you're using doesn't have enough info and/or practice, I would definitely recommend all these books, if you can get ahold of them, as well as the audiotapes (EXTREMELY useful), which are available through Far East Publications, part of the Yale bookstores, I think.  The DeFrancis Series comes as close to being a self-contained, self-explanatory method for learning Chinese as is possible.  I am studying Chinese at home now and I find using these texts and tapes is much less frustrating than what I went through during community college Chinese 1 and 2, in which we used the &quot;Integrated Chinese&quot; texts and tapes (as well as live teachers, of course).  (I got an &quot;A&quot; for those 2 semesters so I'm not saying this out of thirst for vengeance!)  Please see my review of &quot;Beginning Chinese&quot; for more info on why the DeFrancis Series is, in my opinion, so good.<br />In regards to this particular book, you could just use the pinyin &quot;Beginning Chinese&quot; and then, after acquiring a basic knowledge of the spoken language, go directly to the Readers for a hopefully less frustrating introduction to Chinese characters, and skip buying this book altogether.  But most people reading this review, I'll bet, have already studied some Chinese, both spoken/pinyin and written/character, and struggled through learning to write &quot;wo,&quot; &quot;nin,&quot; etc., cold.  (I still flinch at these memories.)  In that case, get this book, too, and follow along with it.  No, don't consider just getting this book without the pinyin &quot;Beginning Chinese,&quot; since one of the most valuable aspects to the DeFrancis series is the English translations of all the text, drills, etc. which are included in the pinyin text but not in the character text.

I haven't shown this book to any Chinese friends but I can't see how the relative colloquialism of these texts would be a big problem.  They don't seem very different from others I've read, and the Second Revised Edition (1976) does discuss Revolutionary changes ('airen' versus 'xiansheng' for husband, etc).  It seems to be the equivalent of any English text from a few decades ago - people might not talk quite the same way now, but the vast bulk of vocabulary is the same, and anyway, no one ever faults a foreigner for having too bookish or old-fashioned a manner:  on the contrary, we often find it charming.  Not to mention that Chinese is spoken differently Beijing, Taiwan, Los Angeles, etc.  Strikingly, the illustrations, though much superior to the cartoons in other Chinese learning texts, are very old-fashioned:  Americans in Western suits and Chinese in silk longcoats.  (Though I did see a man dressed like that in an LA supermarket last week!)  If the drawings were updated, I bet the texts would not make half so bad an impression.<BR>     And the advantages of this work far outweigh the disadvantages.  With almost all Chinese language learning texts I've used, I've felt that I had been thrown into a sink-or-swim, suffering-is-good-for-you situation.  Brute memorization seems to be the traditional Chinese learning method.  In most modern textbooks there is little attempt to explain grammar, and when it is attempted, it is done extremely poorly.  Also, there are very few exercises; what exercises there are often stress the wrong things; and the student ends up memorizing lots of vocabulary words and grammar points that he really hasn't seen used in more than one context and so doesn't really understand.  The whole presentation seems quite thoughtless and haphazard.<BR>   Defrancis, by contrast, seems to have taken the writingof this series as a labor of love.  He obviously put a huge amount of thought into them.  The presentation is well linked together.  Each vocabulary word is thoroughly defined and the grammar notes are extensive.  And there is lots of practice:  each chapter uses the new vocabulary over and over in the &quot;sentence build-ups,&quot; &quot;substitution tables,&quot; &quot;pattern drills,&quot; and many other added exercises suited to the learning task at hand.  For example, in Chapters 3 and 4, when numbers are introduced for the first time, along with the usual &quot;sentence build-ups,&quot; etc., Defrancis adds several extra exercises:  &quot;Number Practice,&quot; &quot;Multiplication table,&quot; &quot;Numbers and Measures,&quot; &quot;A Charge Account,&quot; and even instructions for a number-learning game called &quot;Boom!&quot;<BR>     A short, concrete example of how much better Defrancis explains grammar:  &quot;Integrated Chinese,&quot; which my school uses for first-year text, defines the particle &quot;a&quot; as a &quot;[particle] used at the end of a sentence to emphasize agreement, exclamation, interrogation, etc.&quot;  It seems like a definition, but when you think about it, it makes no sense:  who's agreeing, the speaker or listener?  And if &quot;a&quot; is an interrogation particle, how is it different from &quot;ma&quot;?<BR>     Now, Defrancis' definition:  &quot;The particle 'a' added to a statement changes it to a polite command, suggestion, or presumption.  It often suggests that the speaker presumes his listener agrees with him;  thus the Chinese sentence 'Ni hao a?' is like English, 'You are well, I suppose?' or 'How are you?' spoken as a greeting rather than as a real question.&quot;  A clear and thorough explanation of the function of 'a' -- you don't have to spend the next year trying to figure it out for yourself.<BR>     The &quot;Beginning Chinese&quot; text is all in pinyin and you should also buy the (traditional) &quot;CharacterText for Beginning Chinese&quot; if you are learning to read Chinese characters.  Thirdly, there are the &quot;Beginning Chinese Reader, Part 1 and Part 2&quot; books by Defrancis also that are loosely tied into &quot;Beginning Chinese&quot; but present characters in a much more sensible fashion (easier ones and radicals first) than the way they are introduced (or, rather, not introduced) in other series.  Another big advantage to this set is that all Chinese characters are written large enough to be easily legible. (Not a given in other texts!)  It may seem unreasonable to people who have not tried learning Chinese to have to buy 4 thick texts instead of one.  But anyone who has studied Chinese for a while knows how much you need to take a slow, rational approach.  This is not French or Spanish or even Hindi.  Texts that look easy are actually much more difficult, because they have simply left huge amounts of salient information out.<BR>     All-in-all, the &quot;Beginning Chinese&quot; series makes an extremely difficult job (learning Chinese for the English speaker) much, much easier and less frustrating.  I am currently going through it to pick up everything I missed in &quot;Integrated Chinese.&quot;  I really think it's a big mistake that the Defrancis series has largely been put aside for newer, much less well constructed texts.  (And may I say that, just because a textbook writer or teacher is a native speaker doesn't mean he knows anything about teaching Chinese to Westerners.  On the contrary: often he has little idea of what his students are going through and his answer to protests about poor materials is &quot;Work harder&quot; - not smarter.)  The United States is crying out for more Americans to learn Chinese and the texts used in most college courses are as much roadblocks as they are paths to learning.  It would be a great service if someone would bring out another edition of these books.	2004-01-21

But, unfortunately, there don't seem to be that many good Mandarin Chinese textbooks available for college use.  I may be wrong - I haven't seen all that many - but there must be some reason Integrated Chinese is used at so many colleges, and that reason is probably that not many other, better ones are available.<br />One problem is that the vocabulary translations are poor - it would be better, when a word is a compound of two characters, to give a separate meaning to each character - this makes it easier to memorize each character.<br />Also, there is no English translation to the text, and it's not always obvious what the sentences mean, even when you have translated every individual word.  (The examples in the grammar section are, however, translated into English.)<br />And the other reviewer is right about the poorly explained grammar - there is so much IC2 doesn't even begin to explain, and what it does explains it does an incomplete job of, not answering the obvious questions any student would have.  To be fair, however, comparing Chinese to English grammar is very difficult, and a thorough exploration of all the differences in each short text or narrative would take a couple dozen extra pages.  (A good book for beginning grammar is \\"Chinese Made Easy.\\")<br />Now, to the advantages of IC2:  Everything in the textbook is given in both traditional and simplified characters, except for the index at the back of the book. (See caveat about workbook below.)<br />The workbook has a good amount of exercises and also an additional text, a little story or anecdote (that you also have to look up the vocabulary for, however).  As another reviewer noted, though, the workbook is mostly in traditional characters: only the additional texts are given in both traditional and simplified;  all the exercises are in traditional only.  (Once again, editorial inconsistency.)<br />A final, and most important, advantage is that there are lots of resources for the IC series on the Internet.  Lots of teachers who use this textbook have set up websites for their students (and everyone else who surfs) with voice recordings of the text, simplified transliterations, pinyin transliterations, flashcards that you can print out, flashcard and other games that you can play on line, grammar lessons, etc.  All you need to do is search \\"Integrated Chinese,\\" \\"Integrated Chinese English translation text,\\" etc., for what you need to supplement an otherwise frustrating text.<BR>And, of course, buy a few additional references like \\"Chinese Made Easy,\\" \\"Oxford Starter Chinese Dictionary,\\" McNaughton's \\"Reading & Writing Chinese,\\" etc.  The \\"Oxford Starter Dictionary\\" I especially recommend.	2003-11-06

This is the highly anticipated 5th ook in the Harry Potter series. It is also the best, by my opinion.<BR>  This book portrays Harry as a 15-year-old adolesent, showing us his crushes on Ravenclaw seeker Cho Chang, his determination, and most of all, his anger. In this book, perhaps the darkest book in the entire series, he is angry for all the bad hands he's been dealt over the years, lashing out at almost everyone and letting his anger out on them. Ron and Hermione don't change much, personality-wise, but their role in the story becomes consideringly more important.<BR>  I, for one, was very eager to learn what Dumbledore \\"should have told him five years ago\\" and was amazed at how well J.K. Rowling had explained all the strange happenings and adventures  that had occured during the previous Harry Potter books. The whole book is extremely well done and emotional. One of the main characters dies very dramatically.<BR>  Like I said, it's the best Harry Potter book so far, also the most vibrant, visual, exciting, dramatic, humorous, and just about any other descriptive word one would give to a five-star book. Harry Potter fans won't be dissapointed.	2003-06-23
US	52861081	RPL5SSOIQH9XR	0198602588	17940103	The Starter Oxford Chinese Dictionary	Books	5	84	85	N	Y	Wish I Had It a Year Ago	I've just completed my first two semesters studying Mandarin and they would have been a lot easier if I had had this dictionary from the beginning.  Everyone says how easy Mandarin grammar is and that may be true relative to other languages (and relative to learning Chinese characters!), but you still need to learn quite a bit of Mandarin grammar before you can start formulating sentences.  I always felt very uncomfortable doing my homework (translation from English to Chinese) because I didn't know whether I was using the grammar properly or not and had no way of checking.  I was worried about accidentally getting into bad grammatical habits without even knowing it, because my textbook (Integrated Chinese) has really very little usage information and neither did the dictionaries I had on hand.<br />Once I got &quot;The Starter Oxford Dictionary,&quot; however, homework became so much easier and I no longer feel insecure about sentence formulation.  The emphasis in this dictionary is on usage, so instead of having tons and tons of words (which you can get from a regular dictionary), it has a fewer number of words with their usages very clearly explained and illustrated.  For example:  the entry for the English word &quot;can&quot;:  &quot;Oxford Starter&quot; divides &quot;can&quot; into three subcategories:  &quot;to have the possibility&quot; (translated as neng);  &quot;to know how to&quot; (hui);  &quot;to be allowed to&quot; (keyi).  The &quot;neng&quot; entry then gives two illustrative sentences &quot;Can he come?/Ta neng lia ma?&quot; and &quot;Where can I buy stamps?/Wo zai nar neng maidao youpiao?&quot;  The &quot;hui&quot; subcategory has three such illustrative sentences and the &quot;keyi&quot; has four.  There are also two warnings on translating &quot;can,&quot; one for &quot;hui&quot; and one for &quot;keyi&quot;:  &quot;Note that when talking about the ability to speak a language, whether or not &quot;can&quot; is used in English, &quot;hui&quot; isrequired in Chinese&quot; and &quot;Note that to negate, you have to use &quot;bu neng&quot; rather than &quot;bu keyi.&quot;<br />Odds are, if you're studying Chinese, you're a bibiophile, too, so probably you don't need a lot of convincing to buy yet another Chinese dictionary.  But in praise of this work I have to say that, if I could have only one book to help me learn elementary Mandarin, this would be it.<br />(Note:  &quot;The Oxford Started Chinese&quot; does use only simplified characters.  However, I am learning with traditional and found it wasn't that difficult to figure out what the traditional equivalents were, especially since the entries are organized by pinyin.  It would be nice to have a traditional edition but I still wholeheartedly recommend the simplified.)	2003-06-09

US	52861081	R2W97LUFMLR8XI	0393308804	25935067	Wide Sargasso Sea: A Novel	Books	2	39	54	N	N	"Less than Zero," starring Mr. Rochester	I read this book because it's on the reading list for an English class I was thinking of taking -- I don't think I'll take the class after all!<br />The main male character in the story is supposed to be Mr. Rochester from \\"Jane Eyre,\\" and the story centers around his relationship with his first wife, Bertha Mason (in \\"Wide Sargasso Sea\\" also named Antoinette Cosway).  In \\"Jane Eyre,\\" Bertha doesn't really figure much and was supposed to have been a madwoman from a long line of hereditary schizophrenics and idiots.  But in \\"Wide Sargasso Sea\\" Bertha/Antoinette is really a nice, healthy, poor little rich girl, and it is Rochester's unkind, unsympathetic, hot-and-cold English ways that make her go crazy.  An important idea in \\"Wide Sargasso Sea,\\" in fact the premise that Jean Rhys sets out to prove, is that the portrayal of Rochester in \\"Jane Eyre\\" was a whitewash, and that he was really not a nice guy at all.<br />I really wanted to take this class so I worked hard at keeping my mind open, but I've gotten to page 160 and can't go on anymore.  If this is Mr. Rochester, I'm Tom Wolfe.<br />In \\"Wide Sargasso Sea,\\" for instance, Rochester is fully aware that he is marrying for money and he deliberately lies to Bertha/Antoinette, telling her he loves her.  This Rochester is also a miser.  He is sexually predacious and sleeps with one of the servants where Bertha/Antoinette can hear them in an (unforeshadowed and unexplained) attempt to use sex to mess with Bertha's/Antoinette's mind.<br />All right, that's not at all the Rochester in \\"Jane Eyre,\\" but let's make allowances because he is 20 years younger at the time of \\"Wide Sargasso Sea\\" -- let's suppose that in \\"Jane Eyre,\\" with age, he has become more honest, more sober, more generous.  But he is prudent and refrains from telling Jane this version of earlier events.  (Highly unlikely since he told her other unflattering things about himself, but vaguely possible -- let's close one eye and keep reading.)<br />But as we read on we stumble upon lots of other collateral evidence that Rhys' Rochester is really not Rochester, in fact is no man at all.  For example:  Mr. Rochester talks not as he does in \\"Jane Eyre,\\" expressively and refinedly, in long, complex sentences with a poet's range of vocabulary, but almost exactly the same way that the other characters in Wide Sargasso Sea talk -- in often lyrical, but choppy and incomplete sentences.  And sometimes he's downright awkward:  for instance, on P. 69, Mr. Rochester looks at the countryside around him in wonder.  \\" 'What an extreme green,' was all I could say,\\" he tells us.  Ouch.<br />Okay, in \\"Jane Eyre\\" it wasn't really Mr. Rochester who was talking, it was Jane telling us what Mr. Rochester said, so maybe it was Jane's eloquence, not his.  But as the story progesses, he gets more and more un-Rochesterlike and the world of the book less and less early 19th century.  Rochester and Antoinette hang out at her house all day for weeks on end:  no local English gentry, travellers, or missionaries visit them;  Rochester never goes out for long, brisk, English walks or, better yet, horseback rides;  he doesn't think of work or any sort of industry at all.  Even if he is supposedly getting over a fever, this is simply not English behavior.<br />Towards the end, in fact, Rochester's voice and character is completely indistinguishable from Bertha/Antoinette's.  On page 149, the housekeeper is scolding him and he says, \\"I couldn't bear any more and again I went out of the room...\\"  And in the next paragraph:  \\"...it seemed to me that everything round me was hostile.  The telescope drew away and said don't touch me.\\"  (Ooh, that hurts, all right.)<br />On p. 154 we learn why Rhys needed to rename Bertha \\"Antoinette\\" (besides the fact that Bertha didn't sound pretty to her 20th century ears) when Rochester admits that he, in a Freudian slip, started calling her Marionette -- this as proof of his wily \\"Gaslight\\"-type intention to psychologicallydestroy her.  (Wow!  Proof that, even in those days, men were just like they are now!  Primo deconstruction, Rhys!)  Rochester admits this, by the way, in the middle of a long tete-a-tete with Bertha/Antoinette's black servant, whom for some (again unforeshadowed and unexplained) reason he suddenly starts treating as an equal, even an intimate, where before he had logically held himself aloof from the servants.  He even, on page 158, asks her opinion on how much money he should have to settle on Bertha if he left her!  (That's when I had to leave!)<br />I've given the book two stars because Rhys writes well and often prettily.  But she's simply not versatile enough, in voice or in psychology, to take on such a task as she has here.	2003-01-04

US	52861081	R3I83ZGFSA4RK	1586480049	319133487	The Last Debate	Books	3	4	5	N	N	Mixed, uneven, spotty, inconsistent	Days before the election, the moderator of the presidential debate (Lehrer has of course moderated many presidential debates) is given some secret, damning info on one of the candidates (the right-wing Republican who all the press realize is a truly evil man who will ruin the country) and has to decide whether to step over the journalistic line and use this info in a way that will damage the candidate in the eyes of the voters and so change American history.<br />It's an interesting moral question but because it is set up so weakly, a lot of the impact is lost.   The candidate's character is somewhat like Pat Buchanan, but the situation is more like that of when Ross Perot first came on the scene, and he seemed such a wonderful guy, until we all found out about the steel-tip-booted way he ran his businesses, and how badly he took criticism, and saw the guy he chose for V.P.   Everybody said, &quot;Whoa! and I was going to vote for this guy?!&quot;  <br />In &quot;The Last Debate,&quot; though, the American public still doesn't know about the man's real character 8 days before the election.  It just seems awfully unlikely that nothing would have come to light before that time.  And even then, why couldn't the journalists bypass the moral issue by just giving the damning info directly to the press to report it as news?  Lehrer does kind of explain these things, in a way, later on, but these kinds of doubts gave the premise a tinge of unreality which weakened its impact for me.  <br />You have to read this book, also, with the assumption that Lehrer is being very loose and imaginative here, probably aspiring to something a la Jonathan Swift, because the characters do express themselves in very simple, repetitive, often stereotypical ways, and say a lot of things out loud that you would never expect such people to say.  But he might have done that to simplify things, and of course, ambitious people are, sometimes, extremely simple and childish, underneath it all.<br />And you can't really call all the characters superficial.  The Democratic candidate is kind of a dummy, but he's not really a nice guy, as we see in how he treats his campaign manager.  (Is Lehrer telling us they're all like that?)  And I thought the contrast between the narrator (a young journalist) and the &quot;hero&quot; moderator (from the old school) was very interesting.  And also the contrast between the somewhat opportunistic narrator and the deeply moral and patriotic private investigator.<br />(Lehrer also leaves open the interesting question of whether the American public is better off with the dumb Democrat rather than the crazy Republican.)<br />Lehrer writes with a sort of Southern lilt which is kind of nice, but then, he has everyone - the narrator of the story and most of the characters - talk that way off and on, which is a bad idea if you're trying to keep characters separate.  For instance, the narrator and several characters frequently do what I give an example of above in my title:  use 4 nouns or adjectives in a row.  There's no point building up verisimilitude by using all sorts of place and brand names, but then making this sort of sloppy error.<br />Still, the book is interesting if you watch the Newshour and want to read about the Washington scene.  The pacing is nicely done, and Lehrer is an honest and good man, so you do trust what he says about his world.<br />An aside:  I couldn't help remembering Stephen King's &quot;The Dead Zone,&quot; which also involves an evil politician and a hero who knows the truth about him.  That book had a great solution to the problem, a little more physical, of course.  A major flaw with King, in my opinion, is that he's lived up there among the pinecones, watching TV and reading paperbacks too long, and a lot of his plots nowadays are too far from reality, even for his genre.  And I thought, wow, wouldn't it be great if Lehrer and King teamed up for a novel or two?! Or is that a little TOO Swiftian to hope for?	2001-05-02

There are really 3 autobiographical works that Agatha Christie wrote:  there's this one, of course, which, if I remember right, covers her childhood and the early years of her first marriage, including how she began writing.  Then there's &quot;Come, Tell Me How You Live,&quot; about the 2nd part of her life, during her marriage to the archeologist Max Mallowan.<br />Then there's the novel (written under the pseudonym Mary Westmacott), &quot;Unfinished Portrait.&quot;  Although many things in &quot;Unfinished Portrait&quot; were clearly changed around for the sake of the story and don't pertain to her life at all, it is very frank emotionally about what was probably the hardest time of her life -- her divorce from her 2nd husband.  It also tells a little more about her writing, since the heroine of the story is also a writer.<br />All 3 of the books are good reading.	2001-03-22

The words aren't easy, but, since it's a comic book format, he could understand what was going on without knowing all the vocabulary.  I tell you, he read the first one over and over, till he must have known it by heart.<br />We had always read to him, and he liked other books (Dr. Seuss, etc.), but we had to force him to read them on his own.  This series he loved enough to really break through and develop that curl-up-somewhere-quiet-and-read habit, and since then we've just watched his smoke.<br />The illustrations are very vivid and realistic, and the stories taken very seriously (unlike the silly Disney-type versions), which children appreciate more.  I would recommend this book for kids up to even 11 or 12.<br />Like they say, every child can be a reader if you just find the subject that he's interested in.  For my son, this -- and, I have to admit, Archie comics -- did the trick.	2000-11-29
US	52861081	R2QUTNE8AUD4FE	0440107601	138277602	The Boys from Brazil	Books	5	73	77	N	N	Caution!	Normally, I like reviews that give a short outline of the plot of a book  or movie, because without that, you don't know whether you'd like to spend  the time.  However, unless you're really wavering, I would strongly advise  that you to read the book before looking at the reviews below -- Ira Levin  is THE MASTER of suspense -- like Stephen King says, his plots work like  intricate timepieces -- and for maximum enjoyment you should know as little  as possible about the book before you start.<br />Odds are, however, that you  already know it's about cloning and Nazis, so I'll go ahead and say this:   I put off reading the book for years because I wasn't interested in either  of those subjects. But &quot;The Boys&quot; is not what you'd expect at  all, and superlatives can't describe Levin's skill.  &quot;Couldn't put it  down&quot; doesn't touch it.<br />Plus, any gore or references to sex and  violence are only what is necessary for the sake of the plot, which is  important as far as I'm concerned.<br />And, just like with his other books,  this is more than just a roller coaster ride that you walk off of and  forget.  There's satisfying poetic justice, interesting moral contrast, and  important ethical questions raised -- not just the usual pronouncements  about weren't-the-Nazis-terrible or isn't-cloning-awfully-dangerous,  either.  It's one of those books you love to discuss with a friend.	2000-09-12

Great dark supernatural fiction  (like Hawthorne's &quot;Young Goodman Brown&quot; and, here, &quot;The  Stepford Wives&quot;) deals with fears and dangers that we hardly  understand, maybe don't even want to acknowledge, yet feel the need to  grapple with on an analogical level.<br />&quot;The Stepford Wives&quot; is a  classic for this reason (and because it's a well-written, very scary  story).  The antagonism husbands and wives feel toward each other, often  unconsciously, because of the inherent difficulties in running the  three-legged race that is marriage, was hard enough to cope with before  Feminism came along.  Now, women have greater personal freedom and feel  less resentment toward men (perhaps).  But how about the way men feel?   <br />Writing about the contemporary social scene must be very difficult.  Ira  Levin here found the perfect plot to sketch the current battleline in the  War between Men and Women.  (Although, of course, the modern solution most  frequently resorted to is, in reality, divorce, which is actually no  solution at all, but a starting over, a re-throwing of the dice.)<br />Unlike  the other reviews below, I thought the ending was subtle, horrible,  perfect.  I think fans of supernatural fiction (I hesitate to call it  horror because of the connotation that word carries of explicit blood and  gore, and there's very little of that in &quot;The Stepford Wives&quot;)  will be reading this book a hundred years from now.	2000-08-18

The  pilot is confident and competent but has only some 300 flying hours -- he  mistakes the pass through the Sierras and Lauren, sitting in the back seat  and enjoying the view of mountains all round, turns forward to see a wall  of granite moving towards them!  When she wakes up, she finds they've  crashed: the crumpled plane is lying on a precarious slope a few FEET away  from the crest of the Sierras.<br />(The geography here is part of the drama  because Mount Whitney, just a few miles from them, is the tallest mountain  in the continental U.S., and the Owens Valley below, in turn, is a close  and comparable neighbor to the lowest point, Death Valley.  Lauren can see  the Owens Valley from the crash site.)<br />One of her fellow passengers is  severely injured;  the pilot less severely so but seems nonetheless  unwilling or unable to help.  Lauren and he survive the severe cold that  night by collecting gasoline from the leaking plane and pouring it in a  thin steady stream onto a fire they're started with the plane's cigarette  lighter.<br />She tells in first-person, frank and meticulous detail the  events of that night, and of the next morning when she decides to  hike/climb down from the mountain to the valley below, at one point having  to lower herself down a dry waterfall, and having many visual  hallucinations on the way because of lack of sleep and shock;  and,  finally, how she has trouble finding help when she walks late that night  into the town of Independence!  People see her disheveled appearance and  are afraid -- this is the county seat where Charles Manson was put to  trial, and where his female followers spent a lot of time hanging around  the courthouse.<br />This may not be the most amazing story of survival extant  -- I guess that's why the book is out of print -- but I couldn't put it  down.  I liked Lauren, and Shirley Strashinsky is a really excellent ghost  writer:  you feel that this is happening to you, and this makes the lessons  in survival most memorable.  I found myself saying, as Lauren does in many  places, &quot;We should have had a first aid kit -- I should have worn  better shoes,&quot; etc.  And thanking God that she had just happened to  take, for instance, a good, warm cap that covered her ears.<br />Ironically,  Lauren's father is an ex-Navy test pilot working for Northrop Aviation.   Northrop sends one of their planes to search for her, piloted by a buddy of  the father's who has logged more than a hundred times the hours that  Lauren's friend had.  Point made regarding light planes: don't travel very  far in them unless the pilot has racked up thousands of miles.	2000-07-21

Kay marries a man who she thinks is a genius, but who's  also conceited and selfish;  another (whose name I can't remember) marries  an up-and-coming obstetrical specialist who forces her (with the best  intentions) to have their baby his way.<br />Libby is determined to become a  great writer, but, unfortunately, all her verve, self-confidence, and  connections can't make up for the fact that she has no talent.  Polly's  family lost all their money in the Depression and, when her lavish-spending  father comes to live with her, she's forced to sell her blood to pay his  debts.  Lakey, really the most sophisticated and intelligent, and the  leader of the group, is nonetheless a very unhappy misfit, for reasons we  find out later on, in the very satisfying ending.<br />Although there is a  good deal made about the upper-class setting - how these girls are aware of  themselves as being leaders of their generation and role models -  nonetheless the author (who must herself have been part of this milieu) is  aware that, in a sense, this is ludicrous, and that the girls are in some  ways, despite the best of educations, limited by their lack of perspective.   There is also a strong moral underpinning to the story - the author is not  a cynical person, she believes in true love, happiness, etc., and knows  what goes around comes around.  This allows you to sympathize with and root  for the girls.<br />If you like women's novels (Jane Austen, et al.), I think  you'll like this one.	2000-07-20

It's written in a more aphoristic style: short  and sweet, lots of quotes from Thoreau and various gurus, &quot;try  this&quot; exercises at the end of each short chapter.  A book you mull  over, read in bits, inbetween the recommended practice. <br />This one is more  wordy, a description of what goes on at the Massachusetts General Hospital  Pain Reduction Clinic, where Kabat-Zinn uses a combination of (physical)  yoga, mindfulness meditation, and something called the &quot;full body  scan&quot; (lying down and concentrating on different parts of the body at  a time) to help people with serious, stress-related illnesses such as heart  disease, back pain, migraines and cancer.<br />There are instructions on how  to do the above;  statistical information on how well this program works;   descriptions of the types of illnesses they deal with;  lots of case  studies of typical patients;  and some general conclusions that the very  insightful Kabat-Zinn has drawn from his work.  I hate pop psychology but  that's not what's delivered here - these are very real insights, not facile  at all, on the damaging stresses of modern life and concrete advice on how  to cope with them in such a way as to not get sick.<br />He says, for  instance, that &quot;your pain is not you&quot; - that you can and should  separate yourself from the pain, and from the negative feedback voice  (&quot;I'm never going to get better,&quot; for example) that makes things  worse. <br />They do recommend (as I do, and as I see another reviewer does)  that you buy the tapes listed in the back of the book to help you with your  program.  But you can use the book without them:  it just takes more  willpower and concentration.<br />As far as personal testimony is concerned, I  haven't had to use this program to help me cope with any serious illnesses,  thank goodness.  But (like most women in their post-childbearing years) I  do have a lot of miscellaneous aches and pains which I do deal with much  better using the techniques in this book.  I have not yet had time to make  the recommended commitment for optimal results (45 minutes per day, 6 days  a week) - I just use the techniques (which include, for instance, imagining  that you are breathing in and out of the painful part of your body - it's  hard to describe, but it works!) when I feel headachy or in pain, and  medicine either doesn't help or isn't possible to take because of stomach  upset.<br />What I'm saying is, this book is valuable even if you don't have a  serious, chronic illness.<br />Besides, it really is preferable to use these  techniques BEFORE you get sick, rather than after.<br />And they do give the  advantages of regular meditation, too:  a sense of deeper understanding of  yourself, a sense of wonder, etc. (so hard to describe without sounding  silly).	2000-07-19

I can't think of another &quot;classic&quot; that has such basic and major flaws.  I am mystified that, as noted above in the  professional reviews, T.S. Eliot thought so much of it.  Honestly, the  characters in the Moonstone are really ridiculous.  I don't mean that  they're badly drawn or personally obnoxious.  But the reasoning behind  their actions is frequently, in fact at many key points, illogical.<br />It's  hard to give examples that don't also give away the plot, but, for  instance:  the Moonstone is stolen.  Everyone almost immediately fears that  it was taken by the heroine, who ACTUALLY OWNS the diamond and was, in  fact, just given it as a present.  Why would she steal her own diamond? We  follow the merrily skipping Mr. Wilkie down several more garden chapters  before he finally suggests that maybe the heroine stole her own diamond in  order to pay off debts, from, like, gambling or something!<br />Even if it had  been suggested that the heroine could have incurred any such debts -- which  is entirely nonsensical, because she's watched like a hawk by her highly  morally exemplary mom and about 50 devoted old servants, and she's an  heiress -- even if she could have owed large sums of money, then WHY in the  world wouldn't she have just pretended to LOSE the diamond while boating,  or have a copy made and replace the original with the copy, or any other of  a dozen much more plausible possibilities?<br />Later on, a suicide note (or,  technically, a letter that was only to be opened in the event of suicide)  goes on for, I believe, 20 close-written pages, carefully explaining all  the gaps in the plot up to that time.  The letter is so long that the hero  stops in the middle of it (delaying the resolution of the mystery) to REST  HIS EYES!   And (surprisingly!), the note is written in the same voice and  style as all the other characters' accounts are written, chatty and  surprisingly cheerful for a suicide note, except towards the end, when it  suddenly turns mawkish.<br />Characters change their minds constantly, in ways  that just happen to further the plot.  Mysterious suggestions are made  about characters' backgrounds that are then dropped and never come into  play at all.  That and many other such psychologically inconsistent  occurences and attitudes make the story a waste of time for any reader who  pays attention to anything deeper than the superficial plot line.  The  other customer reviewer below, who quoted Dickens's opinion of the book, it  right on.<br />Still, I give it 3 stars because, if you can suspend your  disbelief in the regard I've described (and I know many readers are not  fussy about such things, and probably would think I was nit-picking), the  book could be a lot of fun.  Cursed jewels, family vengeance, proposals of  marriage, dark murderous foreigners, quicksand, lots of traveling between  London and the country, and England and the continent - it's certainly  entertaining on that score.  And they say the book is important in terms of  literary history.<br />I just wish Wilkie would have been a little more hard  on himself during the plot formulation phase, and in the rewrite.	2000-06-26

The author has the modern  man's magazine style down pat, and his writing has all the typical  strengths of the genre:  fast pacing, immediacy,  verisimilitude.<br />Unfortunately, the book also has all the weaknesses:   there are too many jumps from subject to subject:  in one chapter, there  might be a dozen (maybe two) changes of scene, person, chronology.  All the  action sequences  (as opposed to background, historical, and scientific  information) are in the present tense.  And sometimes the author puts his  characters' words in quotes, sometimes italics, sometimes in neither, just  a \\"he said\\" or a \\"she thought\\" tagged on at the end.<br />These methods, which  are just fine for shorter works, become very wearing after a couple of  chapters have gone by.  Towards the end of the book especially, I found  myself skipping back and forth all over, restarting the sentence every time  the author slipped from past into present tense again, jumping  automatically ahead to the parts in italics, and trying to remember  characters I had lost track of that were now being reintroduced.  Abrupt  changes in narrative need to be signalled carefully by a writer, or else  the reader is in danger of getting lost.  I have to say I was lost a lot of  the time, and frustrated.<br />And the book just bristles with jargon - much,  much more is thrown in than is necessary.  Jargon certainly makes a story  more immediate and believeable, but these advantages comes at the price of  clarity.  I kept wondering if I was simply stupid not to know all these  terms and acronyms, or if I had missed their definitions earlier in the  book.  But finally, on page 200, I read what the author must have jotted  down verbatim out of a survivor's medical records:  \\"Eyes pearled, abdomen  and chest tenderness, pain to quadricep.  Fractured wrist, possibly ribs,  suspect internal injury.  Taking Tylenol-3 and seasick patch.\\"  Now, I  don't know sailing terms, but I do know medical ones, and there's  absolutely no reason for all this to be included in the book, especially  when the author has already described the survivor's injuries earlier - he  had mentioned them several times, in fact.  And the \\"pearled\\" reference  stands for \\"pupils equal, reactive, responsive to light\\" - which is not  explained here and is in fact not necessary for the reader to know - it  just means there's no head injury, which we already knew, since he was up  and talking.<br />My main point is, this is the sort of mistake you expect a  nervous new author to make;  it is also the sort of thing that any seasoned  editor worth his paycheck should be weeding out and throwing away.  Same  for the structural problems in the book:  the too many scene changes, the  too many tenses and quotation styles, the mixed-up, dizzying chronology:   where was the wise old geezer with the blue pencil here?  The Georges Bank,  for another example, is mentioned a dozen times before, on page 93, the  author finally defines what they are - why didn't the editor tell the  author that this info needed to be fit into the first few references to the  Bank?  It's a shame.  The author writes well in many ways;  he obviously  spent hundreds of hours researching this story;  the concept behind the  book is good, but it is still and all a difficult and trying read.  It may  make a lot of money;  it may be made into a movie, but it will never be a  well-written book.<br />There are also nowhere near the number of reference  lists and maps you would need to follow the story intelligently.  Included  is, simply, a list of the men on board the Andrea Gail and one map.  There  should have been lists of the many, many other main characters, their ships  or affiliations;  a glossary of terminology and acronyms;  and, above all,  an index.  This is the only non-fiction book I can remember reading that  didn't have an index in the back.  Once again, where was the editor?	2000-06-08

The parallels between the latter and this book at the time it was written  (193?) are striking.  The main character, &quot;Celia,&quot; has one child,  is a writer (Christie makes some interesting observations on her writing  habits), and loves to travel.  She is driven to the point of suicide (and,  though Christie probably never made such an attempt, she did disappear for  awhile) by her selfish husband's demands for a divorce.  Christie herself  divorced in 1928, because her husband wanted it, and, despite remarriage  and much subsequent happiness, never seems to have gotten over the shock of  such a thing happening, sort of how some children never get over their  parents' divorce.  The ending, also, is on a level with where Mrs. Christie  probably felt herself to be, psychologically, at that point in her  life.<br />Of course there are many differences - Christie was not, I think,  as close to her mother, and closer, I hope, to her daughter.  (Maybe she  flipped them, for dramatic purposes.)  But much of the childhood - the  Victorian grandmother, the trip to France - are in cinque.<br />The  above-mentioned autobiographical parts (especially about the agony of the  divorce, and the writing) were extremely interesting and worth reading the  book for.  The rest, unfortunately, drags, because, without the imposed  discipline and contrast of a whodunnit plotframe, Mrs. Christie is just too  sweet and gentle.  She goes on too long about her character's childhood,  for instance.  But it is a must for real Christie fans.  Read it, perhaps,  after reading her legitimate (and actually, less revealing)  &quot;Autobiography.&quot;  (And don't forget her other autobiography,  about her life with her second husband, the archeologist Max Mallowan:  &quot;Come, Tell Me How You Live.&quot;)	2000-06-01

But I found the explanations about ships, etc., to  be spotty - at certain places the author takes the time (and does a good  job) of stopping and explaining &quot;how ships work;&quot;  at other  times, he goes blithely on when further background is really needed.   Tacking, for instance, is a very important concept to understand in a story  like this, and it's not explained.  (Very few books written for the general  public about sail-powered sea voyages do, though - I finally learned about  it in a really great book, &quot;The Elizabethan World,&quot; by Lacey  Smith, in which it is shown how superior tacking ability helped English  ships outmaneuver the Spanish.)<br />Philbrick also has a little trouble  pacing the book in such a way as to keep the suspense up properly, although  the material is naturally suspenseful, of course.  Also, at times, the book  seems to be improperly edited:  the exposition isn't quite logical.  Before  the wreck, for example, one of the sailors jumps ship, and the author says  that this happened at a particularly bad time, since the crew was now  dangerously short.  But he also says jumping ship was very common.  So, was  it the captain's fault for not being prepared for such an eventuality?   Things like that - you don't quite understand the rationale.<br />I did enjoy  the book and would recommend it to anyone interested in the topic (though I  didn't read, and can't compare it to, the diary of the first mate, Mr.  Chase, that another reviewer has recommended as superior.)<br />If you want to  read only one book on shipwreck survival, the best one I've read is  &quot;The Wreck of the Medusa&quot; by Alexander McKee.	2000-05-30
US	52861081	R2TOXQXNJ5NAEP	0684842971	177682081	Varieties of Religious Experience	Books	5	128	132	N	Y	A Great Book by a Great Man	The previous reviews are very good descriptions of this book. I'd like to reiterate that it helps while reading to remember that this is primarily a study of many case histories of very personal and profound experiences with  God. They are mostly in the form of excerpts from autobiographies and  memoirs, mainly Christian and contemporary (the book was published in  1903), but many also from other times and faiths. There is no addressing  the pros and cons of organized religion here, or, for that matter, of  questions like whether miracles really happen, etc.<br />This book is a  microcosm, though. James touches on so many matters of religion and,  indeed, life and philosophy overall that the book makes valuable reading  for anyone interested in humans generally.<br />He talks, of necessity, quite  a bit about the subconscious, which had just recently been  &quot;invented,&quot; showing that profound religious experiences comes  from there, though that doesn't mean that they're not of divine origin:  perhaps it's our subconscious self that connects to God.<br />James then  analyzes these experiences from the pragmatic point of view of, Are these  experiences healthy? What are their &quot;fruits&quot;?<br />But there are no  ultimate &quot;Answers&quot; of the kind you find suggested in other works  of philosophy or theology.  Despite some heady speculation towards the end,  James sticks to the facts, and never expects his audience to accept  anything unproven.<br />Especially interesting, I thought, were the  descriptions of \\"conversion,\\" a two-fold experience consisting of spiritual  crisis and of release from that crisis and the reaching of a profound state  of surety and, usually, happiness. Besides many others, he describes the  conversion processes of John Bunyan (a schizophrenic) and Leo Tolstoy.  James makes the very interesting comparison of the process (nowadays called  &quot;being born again&quot;) with the natural process of adolescence, and  speculates that conversion crisis, as encouraged by the Protestant  churches, is perhaps one of the healthiest and safest ways of attaining  adulthood.<br />Also fascinating is James' description of \\"the Healthy-minded  Individual,\\" who is born with a trusting assurance of God's loving  presence, and who never goes through any crisis of conversion because he  doesn't need to. I myself would doubt the existence of these lucky people,  but then I recalled a person (my children's teacher) who is always  cheerful, energetic, and kind, and who I sincerely believe has never lost  her temper or been anything more than necessarily stern with her students,  parents, and other teachers. She has a profound, almost instinctive, faith  in God. That for me is living proof of the veracity of James' categories  and conclusions.<br />And James' own almost chivalrous kindness, honesty, and  respect for us, his audience make me feel that he himself, whether \\"once-\\"  or \\"twice-born,\\" had reached that higher level of morality and happiness;   it made reading this book a profound and inspiring experience.<br />Oddly, the  preface (by Martin E. Marty) of the version of &quot;Varieties&quot; that I  have (Penguin) does not mention the following, found in the preface to the  William James volume of the &quot;Great Books&quot; series:<br />&quot;James  had been concerned with religion from an empirical point of view as early  as 1869, when he had noted in a review the 'anomalous' and 'discreditable'  attitude of a so-called enlightened society toward psychical phenomena. To  ascertain the appropriate 'stall or pigeonhole' for these 'wild facts,' he  helped organize the American Society for Psychical Research in 1884. Two  years later he was invited to give the Gifford Lectures on Natural Religion  at the University of Edinburgh.<br />&quot;On a vacation climb in the  Adirondacks in 1898, James underwent a variety of religious experience: 'It  seemed as if the Gods of all the nature-mythologies were holding an  indescribable meeting in my breast with the moral Gods of the inner  life....Doubtless in more ways than one, things in the Edinburgh lectures  will be traceable to it,' he wrote his wife. The climb, however, overtaxed  his heart, which would not have impaired his health if he had not essayed  the Adirondacks the following summer and lost his way. There followed two  years of complete collapse. Thus the Gifford Lectures were not finished  until 1902, when they were also published in book form as 'The Varieties of  Religious Experience.'&quot;	2000-05-19

The author is showing us mankind's childhood, and she tells the story with simplicity.  Her illustrations remind us of the stone carvings and other artifacts of Mesopotamia, yet somehow they convey movement and expression beautifully.<br />The story of Eikkidu is my favorite.  God creates him, and leaves him asleep in the forest.  When Eikkidu wakes up, he does not know he is a strong man, and runs away from the first rabbits and small animals that he sees.  Gilgamesh eventually finds him and befriends him, and the two become inseparable.  Eikkidu becomes more or less civilized, but never, if I remember correctly, can bring himself to eat meat. When Eikkidu dies, Gilgamesh goes to the underworld to bring him back. A lovely, lovely story from the time and place of Zarathrustra, the sage who taught us to call God &quot;Friend.&quot;<br />For the sake of honesty, though, I must admit that my children didn't enjoy it as much as I did.  Though they did read it, they might have enjoyed a more violent, colorful version. Still, the story and the illustrations of this version are historically accurate and, I would think, better art, and children have to be exposed to those things for awhile before they learn to appreciate them.	2000-05-16

Apparently their  creation story was all written up in the sky and, as the stars and planets  moved, episodes in the creation were cyclically reinacted. This is not  described very straight-forwardly, though, and I'm still not sure if I've  got it right.<br />There is an attempt to make the whole thing read like a  mystery novel, sort of a la &quot;Celestine Prophesy&quot;: the book starts  out describing the eager young scientists mixing with the wise tribals in  an ancient ceremony. Later, for several chapters, one of the authors is  quoted at length about how she discovered some commonality amongst various  artifacts and codices which backed up some hypothesis, and which I entirely  lost sight of by the end.  She kept calling up friends and friends kept  calling her up until I thought I was watching a Gidget movie. All the  authors come off a little too New-Age loopy for me, adding lots of little  asides praising the aboriginal and putting down the modern, and talking  about how their life has been changed by their discoveries. But then, my  confusion with all that Jaguar-3-Peccary-Holy-Twins-Tree-of-Life stuff may  have made me just a bit grouchy.<br />At any rate, my point is, all the  reviews on this page (except the very good Kirkus one) make the book sound  like an easy read, which it isn't. It's a delineation of a hypothesis with  some adventure stuff thrown in for better surface marketability.  The  result is, to me, confusing. Granted, it's not an easy subject, but that  makes clear writing all the more important, especially if you're writing  for mass consumption.  Better to start out with one of Michael Coe's books  and go from there.	2000-05-10

This is Dr. Sagan's manifesto against scientific ignorance.  The primary target seems to be the kind of person who believes, for instance, that a cross-shaped crack in the sidewalk can be a sign from Heaven.<br />But that kind of person would never pick up a book like this.  <br />So, who is Dr. Sagan writing this book for?  The average,  intelligent non-scientist citizen?  But then, why does he spend roundly  half the book debunking \\"pseudoscience\\" like alien abduction, false memory  syndrome, and even witch burning?  Surely the average well-read citizen  doesn't believe in those things, either.  There have been no witch  burnings, I believe, in the U.S. for quite some time.<br />And, as an average  reader, I have to say I found this book boring and frustrating to read.   Dr. Sagan confuses scientific learning with common sense.  He belabors  matters of simple logic to a point far beyond boredom, and then skips over  the issues and questions that would, I think, spring to the mind of most of  his audience.<br />It's telling that Dr. Sagan starts this book out  with an anecdote about his standing up to a bully at an early age.   \\"Sometimes it was good to fight back,\\" he concludes.  The bully, we come to  understand, are we, the scientifically illiterate.  This book definitely  has a \\"Them vs. Us\\" slant which I found unnecessary and a little  paranoid.<br />Not to mention the frequent, gratuitous injections of  anti-religious fervor.  In many places you see Sagan, bizarrely, struggling  to offer science as a replacement for religion and superstition.  He refers  to the scientist's role as \\"prophetic.\\"  He calls the sum total of human  endeavor to understand, scientifically speaking, the universe as a sort of  \\"meta-mind\\" development.  He says \\"spiritual\\" doesn't necessarily have to  do with God.  But surely it would be dangerous to make a religion out of  science?  Sagan doesn't go into this, though, or show any signs of having  thought the issue out.<br />Dr. Saganseems to have written this book more to  satisfy his own emotional needs than anything else.  As such, I would  recommend it only to people who already agree with him and would derive  satisfaction from a rather muddled summation of the same old, same old.	2000-04-21
US	52861081	R2843CYPXAXRNO	0395369126	997200999	Decouverte Et Creation	Books	1	31	38	N	N	Part of a plot to stamp out the French language?	First of all, let me make clear that I'm writing about the &quot;cinquieme&quot; (5th) edition of this textbook.  The earlier editions aren't, I think, too bad.<br />This is a shockingly miserable textbook.  I've  been jotting down its faults as they crop up while I study 1st semester  French.  Here are some of them, though definitely not all (and no, this  isn't sour grapes -- I'm getting an &quot;A&quot;):<br />Firstly, all the  grammatical explanations are in French, and thus, very difficult to  understand for someone learning beginning French.  I realize the theory of  language immersion is currently in vogue, but this is a ridiculous  application.  Students of French need to learn common vocabulary, not words  like &quot;preposition&quot; and &quot;pronoun.&quot;  Even if they are  cognates, it's still hard to understand and a source of extreme  frustration, even for me, though I've taken French before.  Also, while the  student is stumbling through these explanations, he's probably also  mispronouncing them, and memorizing his own mispronunciations.  Then, to  avoid English, the editors resort to all sorts of extremes, like the silly  picture on p. 119.  And, at the end of it all, they still end up having to  use English footnotes, anyway (p. 114, etc.)<br />Another problem is the  choice of vocabulary.  They use irregular words (like &quot;oeil&quot; and  its plural, &quot;yeux,&quot; introduced too early on p. 20) in examples of  grammatical rules, making for more confusion than if they'd used simpler,  more regular words.  (Vocabulary words, in fact, are thrown in almost  without context: there are some 100 vocab words listed at the end of each  chapter, many of which have only been used once in the chapter, and not at  all in any exercise.  These lists have no accompanying English  translations, so you have to flip, flip, flip to the back of the book, a  big waste of time.)<br />The dictionary is not good.  There is no  English-to-French section, and in the French-to-English, some words are  missing (\\"demon,\\" for instance, used in an illustration on p. 49 but not in  dictionary, and \\"choque\\" is not defined - does it mean shocked, or  shocking?).  And of course there's no pronunciation key, a problem common  to many language texts nowadays but still bad news for the student of a  language that has many irregular pronunciations.  Also, there are problems  like the fact that ce/cet/cette/ces are all listed together in the  dictionary, so if you look up &quot;ces&quot; and don't remember it's the  plural of &quot;ce,&quot; you won't be able to find it.<br />Emphasis is not  on the type of things you would need to communicate.  In only Chapter 6,  they are teaching which articles need to be used for cities vs. countries,  something which takes a lot of memorization but would not be a big problem  if you didn't know it.  You have the feeling they just jumbled up the order  in which things are introduced so as to make it different from the previous  editions, so students couldn't get by with the old one.<br />Explanations are  so terse as to be incomplete:  in the same Chapter 6 mentioned above (p.  124), they list the rules for deciding which article to use, but then, when  the rules overlap, they don't say which one takes precedence.  I've noticed  this problem frequently.  Also, on p. 100, they give a list of colors to  learn, including \\"blond\\" and \\"brun,\\" but fail to note that these colors are  used for people but not objects.  Masculine and feminine are given, but no  plural forms, except for marron and orange.<br />There are other little signs  of thoughtlessness:  on p. 83, for instance, in a exercise on telling time:   they show two clocks at \\"12:00\\" and \\"12:20\\" but fail to show if it's  supposed to be noon or midnight, which you're supposed to be learning:   \\"midi\\" and \\"minuit.\\"<br />The workbook and audiotapes are even more sloppily  done:  there are sometimes lines in the workbook laboratory section that  are notsaid on the tape (the last few words in a list, for example, are  forgotten).  Often the choice of vocab in exercises is thoughtless:   they'll give 2 masculine singular sentences, for instance, leaving out  feminine and plural forms, which the student is supposed to be learning,  too.  There are never enough exercises, at any rate, in either text or  workbook, to go over everything being taught - probably the worst problem  out of the many.<br />The tape often leaves you no time to reply.  You might  think they expect you to use the pause button on your tape recorder -- but,  if so, why are there humongous pauses while they wait for you to write  things in?  And why do they have written exercises in a workbook, anyway?   Laboratory should be for speaking skills - you can do your writing at home.   (My teacher says it is because people weren't buying the workbooks, so the  editors took all the written exercises out of the textbook and put them in  the workbook, so students would have to buy both.)  Also, the speakers  speak at a normal-to-fast conversational rate, which is way too fast for  first year learners, resulting in more frustration.<br />Both textbook and  workbook have been dumbed down, which may explain a lot of the above  problems - it's almost like a slash job in places.  This may be common in  textbooks nowadays but the editors here could win awards.  It's like huge  chunks of content and sense were torn out to make more room for those nice,  wide, white borders - and the pictures.<br />\\"Decouverte et Creation,  cinquieme edition\\" is barely better than no text at all, especially since  the price is obscene.  Most teachers could probably do a better job  producing handouts on the fly.  Much better would be to have everyone in  the class buy \\"Teach Yourself French\\" or any of the many other  non-scholastic book and tape sets available.	2000-04-04
US	52861081	R335UL2VKEAQCE	0285623907	463963358	Ice Crash	Books	5	2	2	N	N	Exciting, ironic, unforgettable	This is a wonderfully exciting account of the career of a scientist and explorer who, unfortunately for him, happened to be the wrong thing (Italian) at the wrong time.  The author makes a good case for giving  Umberto Nobile credit for being the first man to cross over the North Pole  by air (in a balloon!), yet rather than being hailed in his country, he was  practically court-marshalled.  A reminder of the important role government  plays in either fostering or undermining its citizens' genius.<br />This book  has everything you'd want in a good read.  The subject piques your  interest, and the story itself, as well as the author's excellent writing  style, compels you on.  I would recommend it also as a book likely to help  foster an interest in history and technology in young people.  It's a story  you'll never forget.	2000-03-17

That way, you can pick and choose  according to what's important to you.<br />Also, he has written a little  personal blurb about each one, with anecdotes about, maybe, what kind of  animals he saw on the hiking trail or which specific campsite he likes  best.  Kids' preferences are also taken into account, and the question of  what time of year is best to visit.<br />It's true, this is not a backpacker's  guide - these campsites mostly all are for mixed groups (RVs, cars, etc.)  but Mai's suggestions and the quiet and privacy ratings will most likely  help you avoid problems.  There are a few camps where you have to hike in,  but they are attached to the larger campsites.<br />Mai also wrote the same  type book for Northern California, and of course it's available here on  Amazon.com, with some useful reviews with further info.	2000-02-08

Try to find a Hindu who's read &quot;India:  A Million Mutinies Now&quot; and liked it.  I don't know anything about  Muslim countries, but I am familiar with Indians (being married to one),  and his writing on India, in my opinion, is extremely perceptive and  straight-as-an-arrow honest.  Of course, my husband (who refuses to read  him), begs to differ.<br />Also - when he interjects stuff out of quotes,  like, &quot;He was confused&quot; or &quot;He didn't want to continue this  topic&quot; or whatever - that's simply to make the narrative more readable  by reducing 50 words of hesitation and body language into a short phrase.   Yes, if you've already made up your mind against Naipaul, you're going to  assume he's twisting the interviewee's words, but I believe Mr. Naipaul is  almost neurotic about letting his readers decide for themselves.  When he  does opine, it's obviously his opinion.<br />He does tend to have a kind of  naturally dyspeptic viewpoint on things, the emphasis of his inquiries are  on what's not working and why.  Also, he seems to especially enjoy poking  fun (maybe too much) at people who take themselves seriously.  This is a  style of commentary that we Westerners like but I think is construed as  inimical by people from the Eastern worlds.  But I would defend him without  hesitation against anyone who calls his integrity into question.  He's  writing extremely valuable stuff that's going to be used by historians for  centuries to come.  Sure, definitely, read someone who's sympathetic to  Islam, but read Naipaul, too.	2000-01-17

Yes, it carries you along;  yes, I don't doubt these are real people, and that the author really knows his Calcutta.  But I was really bugged by Lapierre's  &quot;everything's for the best in this best of all possible worlds&quot;  attitude.<br />One episode I remember:  a healthy young woman from a poor  family being given in arranged marriage to a leper.  Lepers, we are  informed cosily, have unusually strong sex drives, even though they're  dying. The woman, of course, will become part of the leper colony;  she  will contract leprosy;  her children will be lepers.  This doesn't bother  Lapierre - he paints a charming portrait of the wedding feast - he writes  about the tragedy as if, gee, if you look at it in just the right light,  folks, it's an affirmation of the life force!  This is the treatment  everything tragic receives, and we get the idea that the physical plane is  easily circumvented, and that if you give it a bit of the old college try,  life in Calcutta can put you on a higher spiritual plane, where you're  blissfully beyond suffering.  It's remisiscent of the Rosicrucian theory  that Christ never really suffered on the cross, he controlled the pain with  his psychic powers.<br />No, I've never been to Calcutta but my husband is  from the area - he used to have to go there occasionally for business  purposes, and he said that after an hour he always had a severe headache  from the clamor, dust, and car fumes.  Why is smog a horrible thing in L.A.  or Paris, but just another aid to a higher plane in Calcutta?<br />I don't  doubt it's possible to find happiness in Calcutta, and I am sure many good  people can be found there.  I don't even argue with the idea that we  first-world people can't appreciate life the way people who live on the  edge do.  But &quot;The City of Joy&quot; is just too facile.  I was glad  to hear of the protests staged by Calcuttans when &quot;City of Joy&quot;  the movie was being shot in the slums.<br />I got much more out of the  description of Calcutta found in chapter 5 of &quot;India:  A Million  Mutinies Now&quot; by V.S. Naipaul.	2000-01-12
US	52861081	R3CYGBG1CTC94W	067119030X	224273411	Dare Call It Treason	Books	5	21	21	N	N	Excellent description of WWI from French point of view	This book is supposed to be primarily about a short but very dangerous time during WWI (spring 1917), when the common French soldiers on the Western Front got fed up with the incompetence of their leaders and temporarily rose up against them, got good and drunk, and refused to fight. <br />But, in order to have us really understand why the soldiers acted (and felt) as they did, Mr. Watt sketches back quite a ways in French history (to the 1800's) and then spends several more chapters on the first years of WWI itself, so the bulk of the book is really an overview. He does a fantastic job at this -- I tried a few military histories of WWI and gave up on them, but Mr. Watt made everything clear to me, not only the movements and main battles (the Marne, the Somme, Verdun, and the Chemin generals were trying to do, why it worked or didn't work, and the effect the battles had on the total war effort and morale.<br />The book is invaluable reading even for just the descriptions of the trench warfare.  I never understood the significance of the term - why they were so hated - until reading this book. And Mr. Watt explains how the Germans and French were mismatched because WWI took place in the window of time after the invention of artillery but before the full-scale use of the tank. He tells how the French military leadership took a shamefully long time to figure out that bayonet charges (!) were useless against machine gun and artillery barages -- also, that the generals thought that to attack and never defend was the secret of military success. So the incredibly valiant French soldiers were sent out time and time again to trot, crawl and climb across the fields of barbed wire -- and be cut down before they could get anywhere near the Germans. After thousands and thousands of men were slaughtered, the generals realized they had to change their tactics and dig in, but even then, for the next 3 years, they continued to launch useless offensives, even though the clear-headedamong them realized that it had become a war of attrition.<br />Along with this recount of the military side of the War and how it made the French soldiers discouraged, Mr. Watt describes what was happening in France politically at the time, which also undermined the war.  Certain French leaders, politicians and newspapermen, pretty much aided and abetted the Germans, because their political base was the pacifist left-wing, and also because they assumed that France would lose the War and they personally would be in a better position for having fostered anti-war factionalism.<br />Despite these depressing events, Mr. Watt never descends to cynicism. He puts forward two heroes -- the military general Petain, who turns things around in the nick of time (at Verdun, and later during the mutinies), and, on the political side, \\"The Tiger,\\" Clemenceau, who ran France like a dictator for those final war years but managed to keep her intact. At the end of the book Mr. Watt tells us what happened post-war to these 2 and also to the traitorous Malvy and Caillaux. There are definitely surprises here - the French political mindset is hard to understand from my American point of view, and probably from others as well. As the author states, \\"It was as if during World War II a former President of the United States were conducting secret conversations with known traitors in the pay of Nazi Germany...and as if the Attorney General and his director of the F.B.I. were winking at the whole affair.\\"<br />Another shocker was the fact that there was at the time almost no independent press, and that one of the top liberal newspapers was being literally financially subsidized by the Germans! Mr. Watt explains that, for some reason, French newspaper ads didn't generate much profit, so, to survive, periodicals had to accept money from political factions. Astonishing, indeed.<br />Mr. Watt is a very fine writer, dramatic, as the subject matter calls for, and almost poetic when occasion demands.He is, as the dust jacket says, scrupulously fair, though not in the least supercilious or detached. And, though there is nothing made up or exaggerated, he manages to end each chapter in such a way as to impell you to the next.<br />For another great book by RM Watt on WWI, search \\"The Kings Depart.\\" If you need to read something on WWI, I would recommend both of these, for their clarity, passion, fairness, and just plain enjoyability.	2000-01-05

I saw this in my local public library and then ordered it through Amazon about 6 months ago as an out-of-print.  The used copy I got was in excellent condition.  Besides being a great casual read, I've already had 2 occasions in which it came in very handy for &quot;emergencies&quot;:   right now, for instance, my 5th grader has it at school for a report he's  going on Leif Erikkson:  the book has a maybe-6-page article about the  Vikings, including an overview on Eriksson's trips to the American  continent AND a good map of where he went.  The writing is excellent, and  so are the maps and pictures:  appropriate to topic, colorful, interesting  and imagination-inspiring.<br />The book consists of articles on great  explorers or envelope-pushers, starting with, I think, the Phoenicians and  ending with the first moonwalk.  These are topics that are not adequately  covered in other, more general history books, or at least not depicted in  as exciting a manner as they deserve.  For instance, the section on Scott's  doomed expedition to the South Pole - I had read a reference to that in, I  think, &quot;Into Thin Air&quot; by Jon Krakauer (another excellent read),  and wanted to learn more about it.  I went to the library and looked it up  -- they had a couple of books solely on Scott, including his annotated  diary, but I really wasn't interested enough to slog through that, and it  didn't look that interesting, anyway.  Then I remembered &quot;Great  Adventures,&quot; looked Scott up in it, and the article on him told me  everything I wanted to know, in a very entertaining manner, including how  Scott's expedition intertwined with Amundsen (Scott had been planning his  for years, Amundsen turned around after missing the chance to be first at  the North Pole and went immediately South in order to beat Scott), why  Scott lost (part of the problem was that Scott hated the idea of killing  and eating sled dogs, so he brought less-hearty ponies instead), a map of  their respective routes, photos of the expedition, quotes from the last  pages of the diary, blow-by-blow account of the expedition, etc.  Of  course, there's also an article on Amundsen.  (Did you know he used to  sleep with his window open as a teen growing up in Sweden, to toughen  himself up?  His mom would ask him why there was snow in his room.)<br />I  find each article gives as much info as you want, satisfies your curiosity  and helps you decide if you want to find out more with other books.  It's  perfectly suitable reading for children as well as adults.<br />I would rail  on for several more lines about, no wonder kids nowadays know nothing about  history, with the lousy, lifeless textbooks they're given in school, when  there are wonderful books like this OUT OF PRINT, but I don't want to sound  like a crank. I'd just advise you, if you want your kids to grow up with a  grasp of and appreciation for history, this is one of the books you should  have at home.	1999-12-10
US	52861081	R23ATZ6RMLI2PB	0023614811	324670362	Basic Mathematics: A Concept Approach (Juelg Developmental Mathematics Series)	Books	5	2	2	N	N	Thank You, Ms. Juelg, Wherever You Are	I can only give an opinion of this book based on what I've been using it for -- summer math class for my three children and me.  It's wonderful!  My kids are public school students and their teachers are great but, here in  California, the public schools are so far behind that you have to  supplement the curriculum yourself.  I was really dreading it, because I'm  not a math or science type.  Amazingly, this book makes it (relatively)  easy and fun!  It makes things make sense.  There's not too much text, no  chattiness or moralizing (I hate it when math teachers say, &quot;It's  easy!&quot;), just a clear demonstration of what's being taught.  It's  solid stuff, you really feel you're getting a solid grounding, and it  really is a concept approach.  Perhaps best of all, the amount of practice  problems is just right, lots of them within each section and lots at the  end of each section, then a more general test at the end of each chapter.  The problems are of 3 types:  plain old math notation problems, then word  problems, and then there is a 3rd section (&quot;B&quot;) that is more  difficult but that makes you think and serve as an intro to things taught  later on.  My children are 3rd, 4th, and 5th grade, a little brighter than  average but all three are different, the older one being a bit of a math  wiz and the littlest one still needing drilling on her addition and  multiplication facts -- this book works for all of us!  The &quot;B&quot;  problems I help them with more, though a lot of the time they understand as  well as I do, since kids are just as smart as grown-ups with this kind of  stuff, really.  I just copy off the tests and hand it to the oldest, and  with the youngest, I give her a few problems at a time with frequent  breaks.  I'm doing the problems too, and feel that I'm understanding a lot  of things for the first time -- factoring, for instance -- factoring is so  cool!  I never realized how useful it is.  And did you know you can figure  out whether a long number is divisible by a single digit by various tricks?   1722, for instance, is divisible by 3 because the digits add up to 12.   This type of trick turns out to be really useful when you're working with  fractions.  We are a little more than a third of the way through the book,  working on multiplying and dividing fractions now, and there is lots of  practical application.  At the end of every chapter is also a section on  how to use your calculator, which I realize now I didn't really know how to  use.  But you don't need a calculator to use the book, we do everything by  hand for the practice.  Later chapters look interesting -- decimals and  percentages, of course, but also an intro to geometry (measuring  circumference, etc.), solving equations (the book has already gotten us  ready for this by giving us some questions that would be easier to solve  this way), and square roots (maybe I'll finally find out what they're for).   I'm actually excited about it, and though my kids would still rather play  computer games, it's minimally painful for them, and a promise of ice cream  at the end of each section provides enough motivation.  This book is also  the one I would choose if I were relearning math by myself.  And there are  more books in the series by the same author -- I'm going to buy Ms. Juelg's  Beginning Algebra with Geometry through Amazon.  The only 2 problems I have  are that, since I'm using this book at home, it would help if the answers  at the end of the book were more complete -- they're only for the odd  numbers and don't give explanations.  Also, why in the world is this book  $72??!!!  I could pay half that price but $72 is just too much.  I keep  renewing it over and over at our local public library.  This books deserves  to be used on the front line of the war against mathematic ignorance, and  as such, should be subsidized, if necessary, by the government!  And Ms.  Juelg is a genius.  She would deserve a knighthood if we weren't a  republic.	1999-08-27
US	52861081	R3TAMWDV99TC1O	0671201174	295476656	Kings Depart	Books	5	28	28	N	Y	Fascinating, well-written, a real page-turner!	The failure of diplomacy and politics which was the Treaty of Versailles is often said to have led directly to the 2nd World War.This book is about the German socialist revolution after WWI but has a much larger  significance. In order to better illuminate the reasons for the revolution,  the author spends maybe half the book describing the whole end-of-war  scene, what was happening with the Allies, and the whole Treaty of  Versailles process.  The emphasis is on the diplomatic and political task  of making the peace, and boy, if you've ever looked down on the arts of  diplomacy and politics, this story is a real eye-opener!  For example,  after the German monarchy collapsed, the leading legitimate political party  was the Majority Socialists.  They were the only ones left to take over and  try to steer the country out of chaos.  Their legitimacy lay in the fact  that they had been handed the reins by the previous monarchical government,  and so could rule according to German law.  Unfortunately, one of the  leaders ran out to a balcony, and yelled to the crowds, &quot;Long live the  German Republic!&quot; which was a horrible mistake -- it implied that the  old, monarchical laws no longer applied, and that the Majority Socialists  had no legal standing anymore.  Also fascinating is the role that American  President Wilson's fussy, exacting, professorial temperament had in the  failure, and the unfortunate fact that the German diplomat the Majority  Socialists sent to represent them was a lousy public speaker.  And did you  know the French believed all along that there would soon be another war  with Germany?  This was why they insisted on extracting so much land and  money from the Germans, a punitive move which only made the 2nd World War  all the more inevitable.  The book is full of such fascinating examples.  I  am not a history student and generally have to read books on history  laboriously, one chapter at a time, forcing myself to pay attention.   Althoughthis is real, undiluted, non-romanticized history, it is so well  written that, after finishing every chapter, I wanted to go onto the next.    The author is an excellent writer, great at character description and at  suspense, though not in the least showy or overly present as a narrative  voice.  I plan to read every book of his I can get my hands on.	1999-08-11

Great atmosphere, and the plot's faults (a little cluttered and repetitive) can be seen as strengthening the presence of the  house itself, shut up and cluttered with Egyptian relics as it is.  The  ending is equivocal, but, I thought, very satisfying -- I won't give  anything away but I believe you have to think twice to understand what  really happened, more like Henry James than typical Bram Stoker.	1999-05-28

It's really in the traditional ghost story genre, heavy with atmosphere, though the hero is atypical (Vietnam vet) and the story is definitely in a male voice.  The  burnt-out vet (likeable, and you do identify with him) travels up to  back-country Maine in mid-winter to live in the cabin he has inherited from  his war buddy, &quot;Maynard.&quot;  It turns out to be a very strange  place.  Extremely isolated, at first it seems he only has to worry about  physical survival.  The haunting or supernatural part is subtle and complex  - I still haven't figured it all out, but it has to do not only with  Marnard and the house but what happened hundreds of years before.  Well  written!  There is a sequence with a hat, blown by the wind, that follows  the hero home, scaring him very badly.  That sort of thing is hard to write  credibly - the author does just fine, I was definitely spooked.  The ending  is nightmarish.  The sense of atmosphere is thick and prevailing, this is  one of those books that is more a &quot;place&quot; than a story.  Maybe  the reason it's out of print is that the ghost story audience hasn't caught  onto it, the author being mainly know for &quot;Summer of '42.&quot;	1999-05-28

I'm in the middle of doing my RN recertification through a home-study course, using this textbook.  It's so good I had to drop everything and see if Amazon had it.  Most nursing texts are so badly written and so  thoughtlessly edited that trying to get information out of them is horribly  frustrating.  I'm not having any trouble getting the information I'm  looking for (the answers to my Scantron questions) - and not only that, but  I find myself actually reading the text because it's so interesting!  It's  a case studies format, as the title suggests, and the studies are  fascinating - everything from hypothermia to testicular torsion is covered  - and seemingly very realistic, as absorbing as real ER work.  And, once  again, unlike most nursing texts, where the writer seems to just throw in  chunks of undigested factoids from the half-dozen reference books she just  happened to find at the medical library, this book follows a logical  progression. It anticipates and answers your questions as they come into  your mind.  And everything presented is pertinent, none of this &quot;a  thousand words where one will do&quot; stuff you usually get from our  buy-them-by-the-pound nursing texts.	1999-04-06
US	52861081	R29KDBEEPH5WX9	0679601287	705016221	Great Tales of Terror and the Supernatural (Modern Library)	Books	5	116	123	N	Y	Indispensible for Ghost Story Lovers	I've read all the stories in this book at least 3 times.  Most of the times I skip around, but twice I've read straight through -- the stories are so consistently good, and, though wide ranging, complement each other  so well.  These are NOT horror stories.  Horror (to me, at least)  implies not only more explicit violence, but also an attitude that reality  is, at core, physically and morally chaotic.  &quot;Dark Descent&quot; is a  horror anthology -- &quot;Great Tales&quot; is for the most part (although  &quot;The Great God Pan&quot; and H.P. Lovecraft's 2 stories provide some  exception) more old-fashioned &quot;ghost stories,&quot; and what mystery  genre critics would categorize as &quot;English cozy&quot;: pleasant  characters, warm surroundings introduced all the better to scare you with  later on.  The evil is seen through a hole in the curtain, so to speak, and  never engulfs.  The first group of stories (&quot;Tale of Terror&quot;)  are not exactly supernatural, but extremely suspenseful, with wonderful  denouements.  Poe's &quot;The Facts in the Strange Case of M.  Valdemar&quot; is wonderfully horrible - a dying man is hypnotised to keep  him alive (it turns out to be a mistake, of course).  &quot;Suspicion&quot;  by Dorothy Sayers is NOT a murder mystery, but a perfectly built-up tale of  suspense.  I've read it a dozen times and the pace of the story still  catches me.  &quot;Home for Christmas,&quot; in which a nice doctor kills  his bossy wife before leaving on vacation, would make a great Hitchcock  movie.  &quot;Moonlight Sonata&quot; is the short but shocking story of a  man who stays overnight at a friend's house and awakens to an unpleasant  visitor (not a ghost, but worse).  Despite the emphasis on surprise  endings, all of these stories have such great style and atmosphere that  they are often, if anything, better the 2nd or 3rd time around.  The  second group, &quot;Tales of the Supernatural,&quot; have all the qualities  mentioned above but are more wide ranging in terms of imaginativeness.  My  Man M.R. James fits right in here, of course, and 2 of his best tales -  &quot;Oh, Whistle and I'll Come to You, My Lad&quot; and &quot;Casting the  Runes&quot; - are featured.  Also Guy de Maupassant (&quot;Was It a  Dream?&quot;, in which a young lover spends the night mourning the death of  his mistress in a cemetery, is fabulous).  Also Rudyard Kipling;  E.F.  Benson;  Algernon Blackwood (&quot;Ancient Sorceries&quot; features a  mild-mannered Englishman oddly drawn to a small French village with a  history of witchcraft);  and such great titles as &quot;The Screaming  Skull&quot; and &quot;The Haunters and the Haunted or The House and the  Brain&quot; which, despite the campy names, will leave you far from  laughing.  There are stories in this section, also, that would better  be categorized as fantasy (&quot;The Celestial Omnibus&quot; and &quot;Adam  and Eve and Pinch-me&quot;).  I liked them a lot even though I don't  usually read fantasy.  The majority are SCARY, though, and all are  well-written by any standard (Henry James gives us &quot;Sir Edmund  Orme&quot; and Ernest Hemingway tells of &quot;The Killers&quot;).  If  you like a more modern style, more explicit sex and violence, less  atmosphere and more cut-to-the-chase, this book probably isn't for you.  But if you like good, old-fashioned, solid, subtle, clever writing, with  lots of atmosphere as well as great plotting (and you like to be scared),  then this is a must-have.	1998-12-29
