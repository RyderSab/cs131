Even though we know the murderess and the people looking for her, almost from page one, this is a good, easy, light pageturner. Perfect for your light summer reading. It IS predictable, and it DOES go on for a little longer than it should. But nevertheless, I could not put it down, and sat up half the night to finish it, and see if the good guy managed to teach that awful and unsympathetic Nora a good lesson. Don't expect too much from plot and characters, but with that in mind, it is really a page turner.	2005-07-10

Alex Cross is investigating a series of murders in Washington DC's southeast-area, and area the police does not care too much about, and where a murder a day hardly is a thing that raises any eyebrows with the people in the top of the city. But Alex and a handful of his trusted colleagues start their own investigation, and they are soon baffled by the patterne of what they belive to be a serial killer on a maniacal rampage. All the time we also get a good look into the mind of this psycho-killer, Geoff Shafer, a good British citizen, working at the British Embassy in Washington. To our killer, the whole world is beginning to look like a game, where you can determine your victim's fate by tossing some special dices.<br /><br />Alex Cross runs into a lot of obstacles, and also have to face some awful personal things in this novel. It is fast-paced and well written, and a very good read.	2005-07-10

Meaning I have been entertained, I have thought a little about what I am reading and that I have found the story flowing nicely along some safe streets, wandered before.<br /><br />The story of middleaged Jessie, and her facing her demons and looking at her life has been told many times before. And maybe also in better ways than in the Mermaid Chair. But there are some wonderful descriptions in this book, and in the book's best moment you can feel the nature, the sceneries and the interaction of the characters, and that is what makes this book rank a bit higher than 'just' 3*.<br /><br />Jessie leaves her husband Hugh in their home, as she is somewhat reluctantly forced to go to the island of her childhood to take care of her mother. The mother, Nelle, is sick and very disturbed, and Jessie soon senses that something she does not know about is going on.<br /><br />Jessie herself faces her childhood demons, and the reader also senses that there must be more to the story.<br /><br />The story is taking another turn, when Jessie falls in love with a monk from the nearby monestary. But all things are connected, either directly or in-directly.<br /><br />Also the Mermaid Chair plays an important role in Jessie's life, in all the characters lives in fact.<br /><br />What makes me rate this 4* instead of the 3* planned is the pace and happenings of the last 80 pages of the book. Happenings that made me think and feel.	2005-06-26

Trace is the 2nd book written in Cornwell's 'new style', where the story is not told in 'I-form'. First one was Blowfly. I did not like the last novels Black Notice and Last Precinct, but was rather disappointed with them. So it took a while for me to pick up Blowfly, but when I did, I wasn't disappointed.<br /><br />And this one, Trace, was even better. There are still dark forces running as an undercurrent &iacute;n Kay's, Marino's and Lucy's lives. Still many things has not been throughly talked through or 'analyzed'. I missed a bit about how Kay felt having Benton back in her life, but he is busy in Aspen, dealing with one of Lucy's sociopathic girlfriends, which Lucy seems to pick up all the time.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Kay and Marino are back in Richmond, trying to figure out what or who killed a young girl, found dead in her bed. It is clear, that she did not die of the flu, which from the beginning is cause of dead. While figuring all this out, we also meet the pathetic Dr. Marcus, who took over Dr. Scarpetta's ME office in Richmond. And of course, the case with the dead girl is a political hot potato, which Dr. Marcus will not touch, and that is why Kay is called in as a consultant.<br /><br />I found this book very good, and read it in no time. It is not exactly as the 'old' and classic Scarpetta novels, but still a great and chilling summer-read.	2005-06-23

This latest Prey novel has a great plot, great characters and is written in a flawless and easy language. Top-entertainment.<br /><br />Lucas Davenport is sent out to smooth things over in a case involving both the local police force and the Russian government. He is now happily married to Weather, and together they have a son, 9 months old Sam. So this story is not so much about Lucas' thoughts and 'troubles' with the women, but more about the case.<br /><br />A Russian has been murdered, a bag-lady has stolen the dead Russian's papers and pretty soon it becomes clear that nothing is as it seems. A Russian police officer comes to US to help solving the case, and with another officer they form a menage a trois the killer cannot outsmart.<br /><br />There are no real surprises in the book, as we know who the killer is from the first pages, but there are nevertheless lots of excitement and I was not disappointed.	2005-03-20

Frank grows up in Ireland: a poor, cold, damp, ugly, depressed Ireland. The Irish blames a lot on the English, Frank's family is dysfunctional to say it the least, and life is not just tough - it is very tough. The lives of Frank and his family seems doomed from the beginning<br /><br />And still, Frank McCourt manages to write an inspiring, heartwarming, funny and touching story. But also a story that will make you very sad, a story which, at some points, seem utterly hopeless. Between the lines you are able to read the humor, the humor that must have kept Frank McCourt (and his family) alive, even during the worst times.<br /><br />All in all, you get the feeling that Frank and his family really want life, as ugly and meaningless as it sometimes seem.<br /><br />I liked this book a lot, and look forward to read 'Tis.	2005-03-20

The meeting og Digory and Polly, the strange passageway between their houses, the 'mad' uncle Andrew and his aspirations to become a magician, his magic rings and the making of Narnia by strong and brave Aslan, the lion.<br /><br />I was also in awe of the description of the doomed kingdom Charns, where the evil queen/witch Jadis ruled.<br /><br />Looking much forward to read the rest.	2005-03-20
US	50919073	RY4G7D0VANCNH	0399150897	362587713	Blow Fly	Books	4	2	3	N	N	I liked it!	I think the Scarpetta-series started going downhill from 'Point Of Origin'. The last two books 'Black Notice' and 'The Last Precinct' were very disappointing. And thus I had not interest in reading 'Blow Fly' when it came out earlier. Knowing from the foreword of her Jack The Ripper book that Patricia Cornwell had grown tired of the Scarpetta-characters it is easy to see now how she wants them to suffer - and they have suffered a lot since 'Point of Origin'! Kay got more and more depressed, Lucy became even more obnoxious and Pete Marino drank and ate and smoked at an almost suicidal rate. Now some years has gone by, and 'Blow Fly' seems like a new beginning. Yes, the bad guys are the same as they were in the past two books, and yes, the characters has changed. But for the better. The story is very well written, new and interesting chracters are introduced, and you do not feel depressed anymore reading about Kay, Lucy and Pete. It did take a while to get used to the third person writing, but after 50 pages it does not feel weird any more. True, there is not much forensic investigation here, but a lot of loose ends from other books, and I personally found that a good thing, as it has been a long time ago since I read the last one. I am looking forward to read 'Trace' now, and hope it is as good as 'Blow Fly' or maybe even better.	2004-12-12

The story starts out in the usual and loveable way - Becky and Luke are still on their honeymoon, and everything is great. On their way back to their normal lives, it starts to go wrong. Both for Becky and Luke and for Sophie Kinsella. Becky overspends (as usual, but this time she REALLY overspends, and it is hard to believe that she has this kind of money) and hides her overspending from Luke. Back in London everything starts to go wrong. As usual one wants to say - but this time it is not cute or even remotely funny. Becky is too much, and it is very hard to believe how Luke can stand her, how anyone can stand her. Her non-shopping sister is more likeable than Becky, and it is in her company, the sister's, that Becky becomes most obnoxious and naive. And yes, it is also very hard to believe how one can be so naive and clueless. It used to be easy to see a little of yourself in Becky, thankfully that is not the case with this book. This one was not good enough, and I only recommend it if you feel you 'need' to read all the Shopaholic-books.	2004-12-03

The story about Sandy, the bored housewife with a dirty mind, and her husband Norman, their friends and families is funny and well written, but not as charming as other Judy Blume books. I am sure it created an outrage when it was first published, but today most adult readers will have read both sexier and more mature stuff than this. Not that it makes the story bad, but there are things a wife would never accept in our day and age, which she may have accepted in the 1970'es.<br /><br />Sandy is married to boring Norman, everything is planned, and Norman feels like they have a good life. On their wedding night he stated that he loved her, and then he also said that he did not expect her to ask or inquire about that again. When the story starts Sandy and Norman has been married in 12 years and Sandy is more than bored with Norman, their friends, their life, bored with everything. She starts to daydream, and her dreams are not pure and clean. They are dirty. Again, this is not something that will chock a reader in 2004, but there are funny and also touching moments in this book. The humour is definitely there, and it is a fast and easy read, which deals with universal problems - problems that couples had in 1970'es as well as in the 21. century.	2004-12-03

In this book Alex finds himself falling for his kid's headmistress, and he finds himself hunting a very bad serial killer, Gary Soneji, who has gone crazier than ever. We are told, through Gary Soneji's actions and thoughts, that he wants to kill Alex, no matter what it is going to take.<br /><br />At the same time, another serial killer, Mr. Smith, is roaming the streets of London, Paris and also the cities of USA. After some events which I will not reveal here, Mr. Smith comes to USA to hunt down people and kill them after his own very special pattern. Alex is thrown into this investigation as well, together with some of the hotshots from FBI. The hunt for the serialkillers is exciting to read, and it is well written, but I wish there had only been one storyline in this book, as I do not think that James Patterson has managed to juggle the two 'parts' of the book that well.	2004-12-02

I liked A Kiss Of Shadows, the previous novel in this series about faerie princess Meredith NicEssus, and I also liked this one, A Caress of Twilight. No doubt the Anita Blake series is the best one though.<br /><br />In A Caress of Twilight, Princess Merry finds herself back from faerie-land, in her apartment in Los Angeles, where she is working as a private eye. But Merry has other things on her mind, and her detective skills are put somewhat on hold in this one. Her more or less evil aunt, the Queen of the Unseelie Court, has named Merry her heir to the faerie throne IF she produces as child before the queen's own son, Prince Cel, does it.<br /><br />The Queen has given Merry a handful of men from her royal guard, and they take turns trying to impregnate Merry. Her goblin-pet Kitto also turns out to be something else in this book, and even though there is a little mystery, it is other things this story revolves around.<br /><br />I still haven't found out if Sidhe, Fey, Slouagh, Seelie, Unseelie etc are real words, but the book is entertaining and easily read. There are some (toned down) sexual scenes in the book, but it is not as 'weird' as in the previous novel. I did not love this book, but I am nevertheless looking forward to read the next one.	2004-11-17

Earlier this year I finally got around to read the book as well, and was not disappointed at all. The story is similar, of course, to the movie, but the book gives lots of moving, touching and funny details which are lost in the movie.<br /><br />Evelyn is a sad middleaged woman, who feels her life is empty and dull, and she is not impressed at first when she meets the old Ninny in a nursing home. Ninny starts telling Evelyn about her life in a small rural Southern town, and while Evelyn does not care at first, she soon becomes interested in all the people Ninny tells her about.<br /><br />The story goes back and forth in time, from the early 1930'es to our day. We hear about the friendship between two very strong women, Idgie and Ruth, and all the people they know in the little town Whistlestop. Idgie and Ruth owns the town cafe, and more than once it is subtly hinted that they have a [...] relationship. A detail, by the way, left out of the movie.<br /><br />The story also touches and deals with other subjects like slavery, racism, poverty but also love, faith, friendship.<br /><br />It is a wonderful history that will make you both laugh and cry, and I cannot recommend it enough.	2004-11-09

After his death he is confronted with 5 different people who all have a story to tell about their own lives. These stories all include some lesson for Eddie, getting him ready to find peace and go to heaven. There is a wonderful light tone in this book, even though Eddie and the people he meets in heaven all have their sorrows and sad lifestories. In fact, the meaning of their stories is to tell Eddie and also us, the readers, that no life is ever a wasted life, and no matter how unimportant one feels, we all have an impact on someone else's life.	2004-11-09

Nothing is really as it seems, and old secrets are being dug up, with fatal consequences for all involved.<br /><br />Because of some of those secrets being dug up, Sara and Jeffrey find themselves in the middle of a violent hostage situation 12 years later, when two men storm the police station with only one thing in mind - to kill Jeffrey.<br /><br />The troubled female officer, Lena Adams, who was raped and almost killed in the first book Blindsighted, and because of that unable to function as an officer, has been let back into the force.

It is a fast read, the main plot is good and it is always interesting to be hot on the heels of an evil serial killer. But the characters are not really coming to life, and the usual 'stubborn heroine with a troubled past' is used too often.<br /><br />Kimberly, the main character and heroine of the story, is a young FBI-trainee, and she is by coincidence and stubborness thrown into the investigation of a killer who has been killing for years. Kimberly is a troubled young woman with many demons, which is not making her life easier. She does not have any real friends, and her relationship with her father is neutral at best. When the serial killer starts dumping bodies close to the FBI training grounds, Kimberly cannot stay out of the investigation any more, even though her superiors has asked her to keep her nose out of it. Her father is an FBI agent who now has his own agency, and he suddenly shows up to help. Kimberly herself is also having personal motives to catch this killer, and while the time is running out, the clues comes together and it ends with a little twist which was just a little bit surprising. Hard core thriller readers will guess the identity of the killer long time before the final revelation.	2004-10-30

Burnt Offerings is yet another brilliant book in Laurell K. Hamilton's series about vampire hunter Anita Blake. Anita has experienced a lot, she is tough, she carries not one weapon but many weapons - and she knows her way around the monsters in her life. Or does she? Richard has left town (St. Louis) to lick his wounds (no pun intended) after Anita chose Jean-Claude instead of him. Jean-Claude and Anita are getting to know each other, having lots of intimate moments and things are looking good. Or at least they are until the ancient vampire council shows up in St. Louis. No one really knows what they are doing there, but they leave a trail of blood and violence and torture. Jean-Claude suspects that they are here to challenge him, and he prepares Anita for the violence to come. At the same time it seems like a crazy pyromaniac is roaming the streets, and Anita has to help the police. Her friends in the police force are starting to look at Anita in another way after she started dating the monsters, and it is going to be interesting to see what happens in the next book. Some of the other characters from previous novels re-appear in this one like Larry, the vampire hunter trainee and Anita's girlfriend Ronnie.<br /><br />It is a great read and it will make you want to jump right into the next one in the series.	2004-10-30

Like many of them, I also do not think that this is the best or the sharpest Lucas Davenport mystery. The action starts on page one when the killer wakes up, hungover. But we are not going deeper inside the killer's mind, which would have been a good thing, and one of the things I really have enjoyed in a lot of the other Prey novels.<br /><br />A super model has been murdered at a party, another woman is found dead in the same room, and pretty soon, the mediapeople are having a field day. The investigation starts, and the suspects are many. Lucas Davenport and his team has to work their way though an endless list of suspects, wasting a lot of time while all the time people keep getting killed.<br /><br />The plot is easy to follow, but there are some characters adn their actions that leave the reader with a feeling of unfinished business. It would have been interesting to cut down on the suspects and instead describing the remaining characters a bit more throughly.<br /><br />The book is called Easy Prey, it is also an easy read, but not as fulfilling or action packed as the other Davenport novels.	2004-09-04

She is a pretty young girl, but she is not happy. She has a disability, and people often think she is both naive and a little dumb. But Sookie is neither. She can read people's minds, and in order to keep people's thoughts out of her head, she has to put up a mental guard every day. This takes so much of her concentration that she often seems slow.<br /><br />One night, Sookie serves the vampire Bill a glass of red wine, and she is immediately attracted to him, as she cannot read his thoughts at all.<br /><br />Shortly after Sookie and Bill first meet, a murder happen in their quiet little Louisiana-town Bon Temps, where Bill is trying to mainstream, which is vampire-slang for trying to live among humans again. For reasons not to be revealed here, our heroine and our vampire gets involved in solving this murder, and the story starts to get going. Other vampires start to show up, Bill and Sookie tries to date, and Sookie also, for the first time in her life, has men running around her, finding her pretty and desirable.<br /><br />Halfway through the story, the characters start to do weird things, and the story get confusing. It is like the author wants to tell too much on too few pages, and it becomes a little hard to follow the storyline, there are a lot of why's and why not's. We learn about Sookie's past, and certain things in her past is unsettling, but absolutely un-neccesary for the story.<br /><br />But then the story seems to get onto the right track again, and the rest of the book is a funny and exciting read. It is not the best vampire-mystery ever, but it is definitely a series worth reading, and you will want to see the characters again.	2004-08-28

It is also about Madeline, who has this thing with jumping into the Mississippi and try to swim there. Cleo witnesses Madeline's first (actually, we find out later that it is her second) attempt to swim the river. Cleo becomes obsessed trying to find out what happened to Madeline, after she finds out that Madeline did not die from her swimming. In her quest to find Madeline, Cleo tours around The French Quarter in New Orleans, and the author has done a nice job descriping the city, the streets and the bars. While Cleo is searching, we also follow the life of Madeline, and via flasbacks we learn about their past and their families. Spelling Mississippi is a good book, but it moves a little slow, and is in some parts rather predictable. There are many cliches in the book, and that becomes a bit annoying, but there are small surprises here and there. All in all a nice, but somewhat average, read.	2004-08-12

Not necessarily a bad thing to write a book about, but Lucy and the other characters never seem to come alive in a believable way.

Jack hates the house and the endless rain, and he is ecstatic when he one day returns home, to announce that he has landed the job, and that they are moving to New York. Birdie reluctantly follows him, as she has done always, very sad to have to leave her beloved house. Before she has had time to settle down, a death in the family occurs, and Birdie decides that it is time for change. She goes home to Oregon, instead of going to New York, and in the next months, she is slowly 'waking up' to find a long lost talent, new friends, new hobbies and a changed step-mother, with whom she has always had a bad relationship. Jack, in New York, is in danger of just being a distant memory. But will their love for each other survive this separation? Will their family once again be a whole family, living together? Will Birdie learn to think of herself an take care of herself and her needs as much as she has done with others? Will she find a new and better life without a husband? The story moves nicely along, the characters are described in a sympathetic way, and Distant Shores is the perfect beach-book for the summer.	2004-07-12

That it true. But I do not agree that the book is not well-enough researched, or that it is filled with factual errors. Simply because this is a work of fiction, it is not a fact-book, and therefore should be treated like fiction, not the truth. I guess that is what some find annoying about Dan Brown's books: they think Dan Brown is trying to tell a true story, that every line i something that has happened. Well, it is not, it is 'just' a wonderful and exciting and fast-paced action read, with a lot of great stuff about ancient brotherhoods, religion, symbols and art. Robert Langdon and the beautiful scientist Vittoria are on a search for an evil scientfic device able to vipe out small cities. The device did not start out evil, but in the wrong hadns it has turned very evil indeed. This search takes them from one end of Rome to another, many riddles have to answered, many dangers have to avoided, and first of all, a lot of people and ancient institutions have to saved.	2004-06-27

But of course, a lot of other things goes on, and we get to know a whole lot of funny, annoying, loveable and crazy persons in the firm. The whole story is told through the e-mails the different people send to each other, and it is a very funny read.

Merry is hald human half fey, and belongs to the Unseelie Court, ruled by her ruthless aunt, the Queen of Air and Darkness.

Before Merry can be persuaded (or forced) back to the court, and before this series can really begin, we need a lot of background information on the special world being described in vivid detail in this book. We also need background info on the certain ways of feys and goblins and trolls and humans - and we specially needs to be aware of the huge sexual appetite these beings have. Merry is indeed interested in sex, and in the beginning, her boyfriend is a seal! changed into a human by accident. His greatest wish is to be changed back into a seal.

I read it in a few days, enjoyed it, and found the story to be well written. But - there is a but - it could be boring at times. It was definitely not the 5* nocel I had expected it to be. Anyway, I loved the ancient setting in the Roman city of Pompeii with all it's hustlers, decadent senators, prostitutes, slaves and gladiators. The main character is the young engineer Marcus, who has travelled from Rome to take over the job as water-engineer in the area around Pompeii. He soon discovers that something is wrong, and the story takes place on this the last days of Pompeii. Will Marcus get out of the city before the volcano erupts? Will he be able to save the girl he can't stop thinking about? Will he find out what happened to the missing water-engineer of Pompeii? The novel is full of interesting questions plus a good deal of 'lessons' about volcanoes, earthquakes and so on. A fairly good read, entertaing.	2004-06-20

Other reviewers has said the same thing, and I will repeat it: it is not good enough, it has been done better before! The Apprentice is a rip-off of great serial killer/frustrated police-woman/gruesome medical examiner facts-books by Patricia Cornwell, Kathy Reichs and others, who does it much better than Ms. Gerritsen. There is not much new in this book, and it is hard to feel anything for the characters. Even the serial killer is just annoying. Jane Rizzoli, the frustrated police-woman, battling not only with sexist issues at the station but also the mental and physical scars from the same serial killer in a previous book, is trying hard to find him again, when he escapes prison. She cannot admit that she is scared to death, and while we try hard to gain some sympahty for her, the killer is getting closer and also playing gruesome mindgames with her. She is almost too stubborn for her own good. When the story is about to get going, it ends. Too much space in this book is used to descibe Jane Rozzoli's mental health, and her angst and anxiety and it gets boring. I was not impressed with this book, but - will not rule out that I could pick up another Tess Gerritsen book another time.	2004-06-20

Well, they are all great, but the main-characters apart from Lucas Davemport and his team, are criminal women. And they are as hardcore as the male villains and serial killers we have met in other Davenport novels. Carmel is a high profile lawyer falling in love with a married man. As Carmel is used to get whatever she wants, and also is a sociopath, she is quick to put a contract out on the man's wife. She is recommended the female hit-woman Carla. Carla quickly takes out the wife, and Carmel can start her affair with the widowed man. But pretty soon things start to go wrong, and Carla is forced to bond with Carmel, and from then on, one killing takes another. Not only is Lucas Davenport on the look-out for them, the FBI is also trying to find them, and the book is a pageturner, an exciting and quick and satisfying read.	2004-06-20

On their way to the island, Teddy gets seasick, and the reader is already sensing that something is wrong with Teddy. And true enough. While searching for the missing patient, we learn that Teddy has some almost disabling migraines and that he is trying to deal with the horrors of World Was 2, where he was involved as a code-breaker. Teddy and Chuck suspects that there is more going on at Shutter Island than what just meets the eye, and this novel is masterly written. The ending is very surprising, and the author has managed to give the whole story and overall dark feeling, which just makes the story more intense. There are many things and happenings to think about in this book, and my guess is, that this is one of those books that will be better second time you read it.	2004-06-20

While the story and Ms. Friess life and her battle to become 'normal' is heartbreaking and sympathetic, and while the issues are very serious and should not be taken lightly in any circumstance, the writing lacks quality. The writing is flat, and the only thing keeping you reading is your sympathy with the victims of these unspeakable crimes.

And while Becky is fantazising about dresses and shoes, her soon-to-be mother in law, Luke's non-likeable mother and Becky's own homely mum, starts preparing two very different weddings.

She realizes, that before she has faced some of her and her family's demons from the past, she will not be able to completely give in to her boyfriend. We do not doubt that she loves him, but we also want to push Kate forward and let her face those demons. The story is set in country-side Canada, where life in many ways always have been sort of simple. Or so we think, it quickly proves to be the opposite, as life is never simple. The author shows that eduction and the broadening of horizons may be one of the most important things to achieve, but if you are not content, and if you bury your childhood and the things that happened back then, there will always be issues in the back of your mind, keeping you from finding true happiness. Many traumatic things happened during Kate's childhood, all the events starting with the death of her parents.<br />Crow Lake is a strong story about finding your place in life and accepting life, no matter how hard it can seem.	2004-06-04

Maybe this is just a masterly written good and dark story. Maybe a combination. Fall On Your Knees is definitely no walk in the park. It is a difficult, complex and thought-provoking story about an unfortunate and very dysfunctional family in the early 1900's. One is led to believe, from the first pages, that this could be a sweet lovestory, but this belief is shattered almost at once, and the story about this family's deranged life starts. There is no love lost between the father and the mother, who, in the beginning of the story is no more than a child of 13 years. Her family will not know of her anymore, and his family is dead. Their daughters grow up to become 4 very different women, and while this is not only their story, the main-plot circles around them and their lives. Fall On Your Knees is not a happy book, but it is not unhappy either, and there is a lot of dark humour between the lines all through the story. It can be difficult to grasp the hidden agenda in the story from the beginning, but it will become clear along the way. A very good piece of literary work, which deserves to become a modern classic.	2004-06-04

You really disappointed me in this one. The story and the storyline was, as usual, great. Anita has to deal with some horrible murders with a distict supernatural touch, and from the beginning it becomes clear, that this book is not so much about vampires as it is about shapeshifters. There is something wrong about these murders, apart from the supernatural aura about them. Someone or something is on the loose, and pretty soon, Anita is too close to the trail for comfort. And on the same time, she is having major second thoughts about her boyfriend Richard. In the last book, she found out that he was a shapeshifter, and in this book, she is trying to deal with that fact. Another reviewer has written about Richard and the difficulties for the reader accepting him as Anita's boyfriend. I agree. I find Richard disgusting, no matter how beautiful he is supposed to be when not being a werewolf. This is why I can 'only' rate this Anita Blake book with 3 stars. But, apart from this, Lunatic Cafe is a light, funny, scary and good read.	2004-06-04

Davenport is no longer with the Minneapolis police, but working on a higher level in the system. He is still solving crimes, but he is only sent out there of there are potential political dangers/issues involving the crime in question.<br />In this book, Lucas Davenport and one of his old partners from the Minneapolis Police, Del Capslock, are flying to another part of the state, a small town, where a couple has been found hanged. There is not question about this being a double murder, and it is of great importance that Lucas and Del solve this mystery very fast. Not only has there been comitted a horrible crime, the bigshot politicians are more than worried that hell will break loose when it becomes known that the hanged man was black. It smells like a lynching, and before the bodies have been cut down, a radical civil-rights man is on his way down to look at things. Lucas and Del start trying to figure out what has happened, as well as they try to put a lid on the racial issues there may be involved in this. They are in for a good deal of surprises. As they start digging, even more chilling secrets are revealed, and it soon becomes clear that this has nothing at all to do with racism. The book is written in typical John Sandford style, it is easy to read, the dialogue is great and the mystery and secrets are revealed layer by layer in a very good story. Highly recommendable.	2004-02-14

I liked that. I also liked the coziness one can find in a traditional thriller, it felt safe, but also somewhat predictable.<br />Peter Mullen is killed while relaxing on the beach. He is working as a valet, and this particular night, he is parking cars for the wealthy Neubauer-family at their annual May-party. On the very first pages, we also learn, that Peter had other talents, serving the rich and the famous. There is no hint, though, as to why it was necessary to kill him.<br />Needless to say, the rich and influential people want to call Peter's death and accident or a suicide. His brother, the law-student Jack and his grandfather, the 87 year old paralegal Mack, plus a circle of friends surrounding Jack, decides to take matters in to their own hands, and prove that Peter's death certainly was no accident. Shortly after they make their decision, funny things starts to happen, and soon they realise that perhaps it is not going to be as easy to prove as they first thought. They not only have to fight against the rich (bad) people, but also local authorities, shopkeepers, employers and such, seems to be very reluctant to say anything that could help solving the case. Even the law firm in New York, where Jack works, seems to be involved somehow.<br />The Beach House is written in a very easy language, it is entertaining, and it holds a few minor surprises as well. Good entertainment value for a vacation or if you have to spend a day or two in bed with a cold, but not a book that makes a lasting impression on you	2004-01-16

He is not sure that life holds anything for him, as well as Mrs. Blessings in her old age tries to come to terms with her own, somewhat &quot;wasted&quot; life.

He also decides to keep it a secret from Mrs. Blessings and the nosy housekeeper Nadine. Mrs. Blessings figures something out by accident, and for some reason she decides to help Skip with the baby. During the book we go back and forth between the present day, Mrs. Blessings past, and we also get a look into Skip's past. The language of this book is masterly done, and the going back and forth in time never becomes confusing. Both Skip's and Mrs. Blessing's lives are described with feelings, and you will feel that you know those people. It is hard not to be touched by this story, although it sometimes seems a tiny bit far-fetched.

Davenport is asked to figure this mystery out, while he officially works solving the Bekker case.<br />The story is great, and the plot smart. Although you know who the killer is from page one, you keep guessing almost to the end, how does he do it, how does he manage to keep hiding? And who is the Robin Hood? Is it Lily herself, killing off bad guys from the streets of New York? There are many layers in this story, but it never becomes boring, and the characters are likeable or realistic.

At the same time, historian Robert Langdon from Harvard, is giving a speech in Paris about symbols. It soon becomes clear, that Robert Langdon's visit to Paris was far from coincidental, as is the case with his involment in the Louvre murder. He does not know in the beginning, but the story shows that he, via his field of study in symbology and history, is very much involved indeed. It quickly becomes priority no. one to find the murderer. Jacques Sauni&eacute;re's granddaughter enters the scene, and from then there is no looking back. The book is very exciting and well written.<br />Dan Brown uses a lot of well known pieces of art, movies, books, scripts etc. to create a &quot;unbelievably believeable&quot; story, and it is hard not to become interested in many of the themes this book brings up. I recommend this book to anybody interested in a good story, history, religion, thrillers, symbols and magic.	2003-12-30

US	50919073	R1A20P93I71AZE	0425126064	355969221	Shadow Prey	Books	3	5	7	N	N	Indian prey	John Sandford's Minneapolis cop, Lucas Davenport, can't decide if he wants to stay with news-woman Jennifer and their baby-girl Sarah. When politicians start to get killed by Native Americans, it soon becomes clear, that something more than &quot;just&quot; random killings is going on. When a high profile politician from New York is killed, and it looks like the killer is headed towards Minneapolis, female cop Lily Rothenburg is sent there to crack the case. Lucas Davenport quickly finds himself very attracted to Lily, and while they try to solve the case, and more people gets killed, they also start an affair.<br />In the shadows, throughout the book, lurks a scary Native American called Shadow Love, and his Fathers, the Crows, who are the masterminds behind the killings, which are parts of a much greater scheme.<br />The stpry does not flow as easily as the other books by John  Sandford, and I was in fact a bit disappointed by this one. The last 150 pages are quite good, though, but it does take a while before the story gets going. The main plot, served already at the first pages, is however interesting, and it is hard not to develop some sort of sympathy with the Crows and their case, regardless of their methods. There is a  lot of politics in this book, and that may have been why I wasn't that excited about it.	2003-12-30
US	50919073	R1677DZMUAPJAC	0425146413	919005077	Night Prey	Books	3	8	9	N	N	Another good Prey-novel	This Prey-novel, Night Prey, is not the best I have read. But it is not a bad book, not at all. Lucas Davenport is back on the force, mostly working behind the scenes. In Night Prey he is on a hunt for a serial killer who preys on lonely women with average looks, women who nobody'll notice. The killer falls in love with a business woman, and starts stalking her. She is unaware of him, and it is not until the last part of the book she discovers what's going on, and then it is almost too late. Davenport also has to deal with a dying state-police woman, who has one goal in her life, before she dies: to catch this serial killer. The character-descriptions are not as well developed in this book as they have been in other John Sandford novels, but nevertheless, Night Prey is a fast read and it will keep you entertained while reading. It is not nail-biting exciting though, something I missed with this one.	2003-11-30
US	50919073	R3G9RSE76KDCKS	0312265867	394337300	To the Nines: Stephanie Plum Novels	Books	4	1	1	N	N	The latest Stephanie Plum adventure	As always it was a pleasure to sit back and relax with a Stephanie Plum book. In this one, Stephanie is trying to find a killer, who send his/her victims red roses and carnations before they are murdered. All the while she is trying to catch the killer, she finds herself marked as the next victim, and she has to look over her shoulder with every step she takes. The criminal plot in this book is not the strongest yet, but the ususal characters surrounding Stephanie more than make up for a weak plot. As usual, Stephanie moves in, temporarily, with her sexy boyfriend and cop, Joe Morelli, while the mysterious Ranger moves around on the fringes of her life as well. There are many funny scenes in this book, and it was a very good read. It can be read without knowing the other 8 previous books, but they are definitely also worth a read.	2003-11-17
US	50919073	R3IS4SEPDRIJXZ	0553273914	934590882	The House of the Spirits	Books	5	3	3	N	N	A Fantastic Story	I read  The House of The Spirits more than 10 years ago, and found it a fantastic read back then. A book that made me borh laugh and cry. I just finished the re-reading, and must say that it is still a fantastic book, so full of emotions that it is hard to forget the story and the persons in the story.<br />It is the patriarch, Esteban Trueba and his granddaughter, Alba, who tells us the story of the Trueba family, from the beginnings of the last century until the days of the miltary coup in the 1970'es.<br />Esteban is a powerful and extremely temperamental man, and his temper is like a red line through this story. He marries the almost angelic Clara, who can speak with the dead and move things without touching them. His love is so deep that he has trouble showing it, and his rage so extreme, that it make him do fatal mistakes again and again. He manages to estrange himself from Clara and their children, and things does not fall into place before the country has been overtaken by the military junta, and nothing is like it should be in Esteban's mind.<br />The language in this book is beautiful, and although the story is difficult to read at times, it is a pageturner. You have to know what happens to the persons you have become to love or hate through this story. It has to be considered a modern classic, adn it is highly recommendable to all.	2003-11-10

It is the best of the 3, but still not a 5-star read. The characters are still a little bit annoying, and the plots are still a little bit too much like Patricia Cornwell and Kathy Reichs, but that said, I enjoyed A Faint Cold Fear, and found it well written and myself guessing nearly to the end.<br />Sara has to examine an apparent college-suicide, and everything is going well until her sister Tessa is stabbed and nearly killed. Tessa is pregnant, and her boyfriend is black. When Sara and her ex husband, Chief of Police Jefferey Tolliver, discovers that the suicide was Jewish, speculation starts. Was it really a suicide, or was it murder. Could it all be connected through some racist-thing, are there white supremacists on campus or is it all coincidental? Working sometimes against, sometimes with Sara and Jeffrey we find Lena Adams, one of Jefferey Tollivers former detectives, who are now licking her wounds after a brutal rape, working as a campus security guard. Lena Adams is brought into the investigation because it seems like she knows something is going on around campus.<br />It is not until the final pages we find out what really happened, and all the way to the end of this book you will find yourself entertained, but there is a risk you will find some of the characters, specially Lena Adams, a little &quot;too much&quot; sometimes.	2003-11-04
US	50919073	R3KEGRHY18YIBN	0425157539	449281512	Sudden Prey	Books	5	5	6	N	N	A thrilling read	Sudden Prey is one of the best and most fast-paced mysteries I have read this year. Lucas Davenport and his team are on a man-hunt which quickly turns into a war between the good guys and the bad guys. The suspense is intense all the way through, and the book is un-putdownable. It is a book in John Sandford's Prey-series, but one does not have to have read all the previous novels to be able to really enjoy this. Do not read this book if you have things to do, you will not be able to do anything else but read! Highly recommendable.	2003-11-03

She is planning a much needed vacation with the man of her dreams. At the same time, her daughter Katy, is introducing her to her new boyfriend. Unfortunately, one thing leads to another, and Tempe finds herself thrown into a case involving bones, dead animals, birds, a missing family and a dead infant. As usual, Tempe cannot seperate work and her private life, and the case takes Tempe and the reader from one point to another. Sometimes there are too many characters and too many loose ends, and that is why this book does not get 5 stars. The book is well written and the plot is good, and it was a very fast read, that just kept going. Without knowing the other Tempe Brennan books, it may be a bit of a disappointing read, and it is definitely not Kathy Reich's best, but it is still worth reading and highly recommendable to anybody who like a good mystery!	2003-10-27

Hamilton. Anita lives in a society where vampires interact with humans, and they have equal rights. Anita is an animator, she can raise the dead. She does not believe that vampires should have equal rights, she believes that they are a menace to society, and she hunts them. In &quot;Guilty Pleasures&quot; she is hired, against her will, to find out who is murdering some of the city's prominent vampires, and this challenge takes her places she has never been before, and she is going to see things she never dreamed of. It is a very easy read, and very entertaining. The set up of the book; vampires/humans with equal rights, is very clever, and I am looking forward to read the other books in this series.	2003-10-27

I was reluctant at first, but it did not take me more than 20 pages to really get into the life of Dolores, her parents, grandmother, friends and foes.<br />Dolores lives a pretty normal and safe life until she is around 10 years old. From that point on, certain happenings shape her into the woman she is becoming 25 years later. Dolores, and a lot of the other characters in this book, goes through many things before Dolores' journey is over. Dolores' life is not easy, and it is not an easy book to read. There is nothing wrong with the writing, which flows easily, but some parts of the book are very emotional, and it is hard not to feel a little bit of Dolores pain. I really recommend this book.	2003-10-21

It has lots of great info on American horseracing-history and it is a true proof that looks isn't all. The lives of the trainers, owners and jockeys sometimes seems out of this world, but it is also a proof that life can be a great adventure. The author knows her stuff, and even though it is a non-fiction book, it was a pleasure to read it. It will appeal to anybody interested in a good story, but there are some technical terms that may be off-putting for some.	2003-10-20

There is the usual praise for the author's other books in the beginning of It's Okay, I'm.....and somewhere it says that Georgia, our heroine, is a youg Bridget Jones. And that is not all that wrong.<br />The book is about Georgia, aged 14 and her teenage trouble with parents, littlesister, boyfriends, school, looks etc.<br />The plot or non-plot of this book would have been utterly boring, if it wasn't for the very funny use of the English/British language. I am also sure every girl aged 12-99 can relate to some of Georgia's antics if not all of them.<br />I bought this book thinking it was about a young woman, not a teenage girl, but I nevertheless liked the book. I think all teenage girls will love it.	2003-08-31
US	50919073	R3ENA8BF0BMLR3	0312195516	226874686	The Red Tent	Books	4	1	2	N	N	An amazingly good read	This book was recommended to me by a book club friend, and I purchased it right away. However, it took me some months to actually sit down and read it, because I to begin with, felt that the story did not sound like anything I would like to read. How wrong I was!<br />The story about Laban's 4 daughters and Dinah, \\"their\\" daughter, is an amazing story about growing up, becoming a woman, about love and hate, about men and women, about sex, child births, triupmhs and tragedies. This book has it all, and even though it is build on biblical characters, it doesn't become \\"too biblical\\" in any way. The story is well developed and the characters easy to associate with, even though the story takes place more than 1000 years ago.<br />It is definitely a woman-book, and I am not sure all men will enjoy it as much as the women will.<br />I would have rated this 5 if the last part of the book had moved just a bit quicker and if the editors had cut maybe 20 or 30 pages out, but all in all this is a hughly recommendable book.	2003-08-31

The Empress File is the second in this series, but the first one I've read.<br />The computer-expert/artist/con-man Kidd receives a call late at night from his online friend Bobby, asking him to go to the town of Longstreet, where a black kid has been shot by the cops. The town is covering up this shooting, as it was the wrong boy who got shot.<br />The town's underground hard-core black politicians are mad, about the killing of the black boy which is just the latest thing in a row of injustices, redneck racism and corruption in this small Southern town.<br />Kidd is asked to help developing a scheme, making the current city council fall. His on and off lover, the burglar LuEllen, is brought in as his sidekick, and the story takes off.<br />There were some intrigues in this story concerning political stuff and computer technicalities that I couldn't quite figure out, but the story moves quickly along, and it is overall a fast and easy read. Some of the rednecks and their methods stand out as particular bad, and the freaky new-age mayor is also a good character.<br />Though I am not rating this story a 5 star read, I am sure I will read the other Kidd-novels by John Sandford.	2003-07-28
