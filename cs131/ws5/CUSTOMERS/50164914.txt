However, since he has gone to writing two books per year, his quality has fallen, and recent work has been particularly prone to the sort of glaring plot holes that faith in the author is stretched to the fracturing threshold.  Naked Prey is the latest example of Sandford's that could have used extra editing.  First chapter, opening scene: as spooky, vivid, and engaging an opening as any I can recall, yet in reading it, I noted the obvious, glaring fact that the baddie left fingerprints on the hand cuffs... apparently the police never checked. <br /> <br />There are many other examples, which I will skip to avoid spoiling the plot, but each chips away at the suspension of disbelief, at the trust invested by the reader in the author, until the plot deviates so radically from reality that one can no longer feel the outcome has relevence. <br /> <br />It's too bad, really, as Sandford is capable of so much more, as he demonstrated in early Prey's, back when he limited his output to one a year.  After Chosen Prey, which coincidentally had another fingerprint snafu, I'd convinced myself the series had run its course.  Two books later, I am forced to agree with that assessment.  His characters deserve much more.	2005-08-29

Sure, it succeeds in describing ways around and out of San Francisco, but does so much more.  Even for someone who's never been on two wheels, the descriptions of the neighborhoods, their attractions and history, is worth the investment.  I strongly recommend it, the best cycling guide book of its type I've read.<br />The one weakness is a lack of an index.  You might read an excellent review, for example, of a burrito shop, but recalling on which ride that review occurred may turn into a serial search operation.  Nevertheless, it still ranks as a 5-star on this rating scale.  Virtually a must-read for all cyclists in SF.	2004-02-09
US	50164914	R2QVSLSSL5FW0O	044661162X	77432495	Chasing the Dime	Books	3	3	3	N	N	nanotubular	With Chasing the Dime, Michael Connelly compellingly enters the intense world of high-risk technology start-ups.  I found the descriptions of Henry Pierce's involvment in his company and his work in carbon-based nanotechnology fascinating, with remarkable parallels with my own life.  I clearly recognized Henry's seemingly unresolvable conflicts.   And Michael's description of the molecular technology which was the object of Henry's obsession was realistic enough to me to be credible.  The investor chase was icing on the cake.<br />However, suspension of disbelief is a fragile thing, and in the<BR>case of Chasing the Dime, too often I found myself without explanation for events.  One obvious example is Henry, who's technological acuity is top-notch, seems to ignore the existence of search engines.  (a Google search for the phone number was the obvious approach from chapter 1...).  There are other examples.  Furthermore, the issue of why the phone company apparently ignored its policy of waiting before reassigning numbers was never addressed by numerous characters, including the police.   <br />The Google complaint may be nit-picking.  But imagine if a character sent a telegram instead of making a phone call or email.   That would be no more out of place.<br />Other actions, seemingly irrational, are explained by Henry's dance with insanity.  He is under enourmous stress professionally, socially, psychologically, and legally.   A few panicked moves or oversights are expected.<br />However, the finale is a classic case of &quot;deux ex machina&quot; --  the hand of God comes down and wraps things up in one chapter or less.  Although the finish is the hardest part of a novel to do well, Connelly normally scores.   Here, he's a bit off-target.<br />I don't think it's a coincidence that 2002 is the first year MC published more than one novel.   I'm convinced one per year is the limit for top-quality work.   Chasing the Dime was a really enjoyable and rewarding read, but the flaws were sufficiently obvious that I can't help but conclude it needed a bit more time.	2003-09-07

This is just the most egregious example. Elsewhere, action scenes are described unclearly, often requiring rereading to clarify the flow.<br />So on the local scale, the book falls short.  Clearly it lacks the level of editing and revision expected from a professional work.  But on the global scale, it also fails.  The book has the feel of being written on a page budget, the plot development dictated by the page number rather than by events and circumstances.   After clumsy middle-chapter plodding, things are wrapped up with remarkable efficiency as the magic number of 400 is approached.<br />The problem here is that Sandford, like so many best-selling authors, has gone to writing two books per year instead of the still-challenging one.  Compromises must be made, quality must suffer, but profit justifies all.  &quot;Mortal Prey&quot; rings with but an echo of the magic of such classics as &quot;Winter Prey&quot;.  It's not a total loss -- the echo, at least, is still there.  But why settle?<br />Unfortunately for me, this is the second consecuting Prey book which has missed the target, after &quot;Easy Prey&quot;.   So I am afraid I must now move on.   My strong recommendation -- start with Rules of Prey and go through the series.  The early books shine where these late works fail.   Don't fall &quot;prey&quot; to the &quot;best seller&quot; syndrome.	2003-09-07

It begins as an<BR>unread sequence of words, the whimsical construction<BR>of the author's mind.

Connelly for the first time describes<BR>Harry Bosch from the perspective of another primary character, Terry<BR>from Blood Work, contrasting it with Harry's view.<BR>This allows observations of Harry that<BR>wouldn't be possible from the conventional first-person of<BR>previous Bosch novels. Additionally, the presence of Terry allows a<BR>contrast of two very different characters. The risk with having two<BR>protagonists is their characteristics will tend to merge, both taking<BR>on those of the author. In the case of ADMTN, Connelly does a solid<BR>job of maintaining the distinct identity of each. In addition to the<BR>multi-perspective view of Bosch, there is a similar \\"study\\" of Terry,<BR>although Connelly fans have more invested in Bosch to date.<br />Second, it's a study in the descent into darkness. From his days in<BR>the tunnels of Vietnam, through his time with LAPD, Harry has been<BR>immersing himself in both physical and metaphorical darkness. The<BR>novel considers the effect of that prolonged exposure. Sure, it's an<BR>old theme (Luke's struggles with the Dark Side), but worth revisiting.<br />Third, it's a courtroom drama. Many have criticized this aspect of the<BR>book. It's a matter of taste -- I really enjoyed the court scenes,<BR>providing insight into the legal process with a Los Angeles spin in<BR>the Court TV age.  One of Connelly's great successes as a writer is he<BR>is able to capture the flavor of Los Angeles in a way most authors are<BR>unable to grasp. Chandler, Parker, Sandford, --- through their eyes,<BR>LA is a featureless, generic, list of place-names. Connelly gives it<BR>life.<br />And then there's the Hollywood theme. Connelly describes the power<BR>wielded by producers -- desperate actresses struggling for<BR>their professional lives, willing to do anything to expose themselves<BR>(pun intended) to those in positions of strength.  In aworld<BR>where success isn't necessarily due to merit but instead<BR>due to prior success, the stories of those trying to make the<BR>leap to the inner circle are compelling.<br />All the parts are strong.  Is it a classic of the genre, a masterpiece<BR>or signature work? Not quite, so it doesn't rate 5 stars. I almost<BR>drop it to three, due to what I consider a rather contrived plot,<BR>especially involving the film producer. But then what can one expect<BR>from a professional contriver, as film producers are?<br />So I'll give it four. Read the book -- if you enjoy courtroom<BR>dialogue, at least, you won't regret it.	2002-03-29

They describe well the style -- apparently<BR>discordant events are brought into harmony by the end,<BR>clues and events explained and tied together, the threads<BR>combined into a coherent tree.<br />Good stuff.<br />I recently reviewed &quot;Easy Prey&quot; in which I lamented the lack<BR>of key elements of good crime fiction there.  This book is the<BR>opposite -- it has it all.  The two most important are<BR>&quot;mystery&quot; and &quot;suspense&quot;, the former the challenge to explain<BR>unexplained past events, the latter the challenge to predict<BR>future ones.  Both of these elements are present in spades.<BR>They keep the pages turning, often with the wonderful<BR>&quot;Aha! I should have predicted that!&quot;  moments which make<BR>good works in the genre so rewarding.<br />I strongly recommend this book.  The only perhaps weakness<BR>is character development is a bit shallow -- it isn't Connelly's<BR>strong point, and here he's tackled the challenge of going from<BR>his speciality of male law enforcement figures by presenting<BR>a female law-breaking protagonist.  But he pulls it off<BR>competently, allowing the other elements of the book to show<BR>their strength.	2002-03-07

This has the advantage of keeping the action fresh; unlike the pig on the cover, the plot never gets stuck in the mud.   It's a nice feature.<br />But the other two which comes to mind is the number of books Parker has been writing each year.  I feel this results in a lack of polish in his late work.  His work would be improved by more focus on each book -- one per year is enough for most authors of quality work, and I think Parker should take that as a model.<br />Hush Money is a decent read.  Again, Spenser resists intimidation by the heavies.  Again, Spenser resists temptation from a highly attractive woman.  Again, Spenser and Hawk flex their muscle. Again, Spenser confronts controversial social issues.  The usual.<br />But the usual isn't bad.  Parker's writing, his description and dialogue, are always enjoyable even if the stories aren't as fresh as they once were.  If you're new to Parker, I recommend going back to the early works and starting the series in sequence.  If you get this far, you're obviously a fan, have a lot invested in the characters, and you'll like Hush Money.   But if you're a general fan of detective fiction, you might be disappointed by jumping right to his late work.  It's more about character, more about social issues, and less about detection, mystery, or suspense.	2000-12-30

It would have been inappropriate to have so intense a story follow so quickly -- the suspension of disbelief would have been been unsustainable.<br />So Sudden Mischief focuses on relationships more than action. While Pastimes illuminated Spenser's childhood, details of Susan's pre-Spenser history are exposed in Mischief.  This isn't as bad as it might seem.  Earlier in the series, I found Susan to be so self-absorbed I almost stopped reading.  However, she's since matured, developed, and become more an asset to Spenser's work than a liability.  I actually found her presence enjoyable here.<br />The &quot;mystery&quot; part of the book is more ordinary by Spenser standards.  As others have pointed out, there's all the usual Spenser elements, including his annual rejection  of supermonogamous temptations.  But the story is hardly very compelling.  There isn't much mystery there.  The reader is left in a more passive role, turning the pages to see what will happen next, without much speculation into or concern over what that will be.  Still, the story isn't overtly bad.<br />Even if it was, Parker's writing is always a joy.  So, if you're a fan of the Spenser series, Sudden Mischief is a worthwhile investment of your time, and not only for the development of Susan's character.	2000-12-28

Parker has consistently shown himself to be an excellent writer. Often, however, the quality of the story isn't up to the same standards.  In Small Vices, however, it is.<br />This is, I dare say, the best Spenser novel to date. Chance, Parker's previous contribution to the series, was a disappointment.  But like a weak jab setting up the knockout uppercut, Small Vices is top-notch.  There's mystery here, highly compelling characters (including perhaps the most interesting Spenser adversary to date), social commentary, excellent dialogue, several strong social themes, and, most of all, page-turning suspense.   And, unlike most suspense works, the finish wasn't a disappointment.<br />Parker's work is best read as part of the series.  However, this still rates four stars as a stand-alone work. You lose out on a lot of the history behind some of the characters, but it's still basically whole.<br />Maybe Parker, like Spenser, finally got off the decaf.  If so, I hope he stays off.  Sometimes, a small vice can be a good thing.<br />Dan	2000-12-15

Parker is an excellent author -- he could pull three stars out of a description of Spenser getting audited on his income taxes.  Maybe four.<br />But of his recent work, Chance is a bit of a disappointment. Mystery?  There isn't really a mystery here the reader can solve.  Character?  The new characters are all rather shallow, structureless, and uncompelling.  This may be a statement about the type of people attracted to Vegas, a city which plays a promonent role in the story, yet no insight is gained into the shallowness, no real new perspective is offered.   Suspense?  There really isn't much.   Drama? No, not much of that either.<br />Really there isn't much here, globally.  Locally, it's better. The interactions between Spenser and the others is, as usual, a joy to read.  And Spenser's verbal quips, cultural references, and interesting insights are worth the read.  But the book needs a bit more.  And Parker's shown before that he can provide it.<br />Note : This review is based on the book as a part of the Spenser series.   The Spenser books are best read in chronological sequence.  As a standalone book, this is  probably only two stars.	2000-12-13

What happened and who did it is never in question -- the issue is what will happen.  While this is being resolved, Parker reveals rich details about the principal characters, keeping the reader engaged throughout the entire book.<br />Viewpoint varies with the primary chapters, as usual in the Spenser series, from the detectives perspective. Between these, the victim Lisa's view is represented. This is quite nicely pulled off. <br />The welcomed trend in the series of deemphasizing the tiresome participation of Susan in the primary plot continues with Thin Air.  Additionally, giving a rest to the use of  Hawk as a superhero to completely suppress any opposition is also welcomed.  While Hawk is a very enjoyable character, he's overused in the books preceding this.<br />So Thin Air is highly recommended.  If there is one criticism, some of the action at the end strains credibility to the point of collapse.  But the reader is still touched by the result, something which can't often be said for genre work. This book only reinforces my assessment that Parker is an excellent writer.<br />Dan	2000-11-26

It has all the elements -- engaging characters, an interesting locale, a novel crime, and Parker's usual wonderful dialog.<br />However, like the play which opens the work, Walking Shadow drags on.  All the main characters seem to become bored with the case.  How can the reader avoid following their example?  It's a bad sign when I was relieved to finally reach the end, an end which was achieved without much of a climax.<br />Overall, it isn't a bad work, and is certainly recommended for fans of the Spenser series.

By the end, the simple story grows into one of Parker's most complex plots.<br />And as social commentary, it also succeeds.  In addition to Parker's comparison of different economic classes, he addresses the issue of homosexual prejudice.  It's all effectively done without being excessively didactic.<br />Paper Doll is highly recommended for fans of the series, even if you don't follow the best approach of reading them in chronological sequence.	2000-10-12

But it also describes the plot structure of the book.  Two plots, each involving pairs.  On one side, a double homicide.  On the other, a contrast of two relationships.  Both of these plots are rich in social commentary, clearly the focus of this book.<br />Content in works of the Spenser genre can be largely  partitioned into mystery and suspense.  The former is uncertainty over what happened,  while the latter is uncertainty over what will happen.  Double Deuce, however, is rather lacking in both.  As in Playmates, a book which precedes this one by several years, Parker uses the work to take a look at issues of  the black community.  Double Deuce is the more successful of the two.  Parker's views on the subject are certainly worth the reading, even if it isn't a classic of social commentary.	2000-10-06

The method of transportation via duplication is an interesting one, with clear ethical implications which we haven't as yet had to address. Additionally, the representation of the aliens was provoking -- the story never resolves who are the &quot;good guys&quot; and who are the &quot;bad guys&quot;, but then real life is rarely black and white.<br />But despite the positive aspects of the work, the end was a profound disappointment -- too much was unresolved.  Normally this wouldn't necessarily be a bad thing, but in this case the reader is left feeling empty; little is learned.  So while The Other End of Time has components of interest, overall it's lacking, and the characters, which are established in a promising fashion, descend towards the end into cliche.  The interesting  discrete elements fail to make a compelling package.<br />Overall, it's hard to recommend this book.	2000-10-04

It lacks the landmark status of A Study in Scarlet and the  overall drama of The Hound of the Baskervilles, but nevertheless is a  must-read for all Holmes fans and is strongly recommended to fans of  detective fiction.  The crime scene is a classic -- &quot;Watson, when you  have eliminated all other possibilities, the remaining possibility, no  matter how seemingly improbable, is nevertheless likely&quot;.... or  something like that.<br />While A Study in Scarlet deals rather unmercifully  with the Mormon colony in Utah, A Sign of Four presents what would now be  considered a strikingly politically incorrect perspective on India. It's an  historically interesting British viewpoint from late in the last  century.<br />Whether you read a public copy or get it from the University of  Virginia on-line archive, I strongly recommend A Sign of Four.

It's a true classic, and a  must-read for anyone who is interested in Holmes or, for that matter, the  general subject of criminal investigation. The description of Holmes and  his methods is not to be missed.<br />A Study in Scarlet is historic on many  fronts.  First, it contains an interesting British perspective on some  American history.  Second, it describes London of the last century from the  perspective of an author who was there.  And third, it is history itself, a  landmark work in detective fiction, and in the application of scientific  method to forensics.<br />But on top of all this, how can one resist the  chance to read a work which goes to four levels of quotation? Watson  quoting Gregson quoting Charpentier quoting Drebber, direct throughout, is  alone worth the price of admission.	2000-09-12

I started Spenser at book one, and  have proceeded in sequence. The life and strength of the earlier books had  recently wavered, as the series has at times become bogged down in the  relationship between Spenser and Susan.  Susan's general self-absorption is  bothersome, and Spenser's overt philosophization in her presence is losing  whatever novelty it ever had.  Indeed, as the chapters progressed, I  started to fear this book would continue the generally downward trend, with  Parker indulging in a Spenser commentary of his past and the philosophy of  life. Pastimes looked to be a struggle for even three stars.<br />But then,  things changed.  Parker moved on to what he does very well -- action.   Susan took a back seat, leaving Spenser to shine.  The closing chapters are  among the best I've read in the series, leaving me looking forward to  continue it with renewed enthusiasm.<br />Even if you haven't read all the  books preceding it, Pastime is a good selection.  Then, if you're hooked,  dig up a copy of the Godwulf Manuscript, and start the series in order.   The early books won't disappoint.	2000-09-10

And while the main story is one of pure suspense, with any  real element of mystery sacrificed to study the villain, Sandford weaves in  a subplot which is classic &quot;locked door&quot; (as another reviewer  puts it).  It's nicely done.<br />A question for those who've read the book :  If SSA is backwards, is SJ as well?  What's the author's name?	2000-09-02

Not only is it important for  continuity of plot and character development, but the earlier entries in  the series are better.  This review assumes you have done so -- the rating  is two stars as a standalone book.<br />Black Notice opens strongly.  Cornwell  does the best crime-scene description of any author I've read.  And, as  virtually all reviewers point out, her description of forensic medicine is  striking.<br />However, as this book progresses, it becomes mired in  Scarpetta's self-absorption.  Cornwell tries to transcend the genre in  which she demonstrated such skill in her early books, yet in so doing  neglects it.   This would be fine if the study in grief were especially  believable or insightful, but it instead approaches being maudlin,  excessive.<br />As the book approaches its finish, the social developments  seem better suited to pulp romance fiction.  As the thread wears on, the  remaining pages dwindle, leaving precious little space to conclude the  principal plot.<br />While the finish is certainly better than that of Point  of Origin, it is nevertheless lacking.  And as is the trend in her books,  the end comes quite suddenly. Too suddenly.  It's as if, during coverage of  a baseball game, the screen goes blank the instant the winning home run  ball crosses the threshold of the fence.  Game over.<br />Will I read the next  book in the series?  I've read them all, in order, to this point, so  probably.  But I have no problem waiting until the end of 2001, when it  comes out in paperback.	2000-08-27

And like other  reviewers, I found the style of Night Crew substantially different from  that of the Preys.<br />But I liked it.<br />With respect to the style -- there  are two really obvious differences.  One is the location, Los Angeles, as  opposed to Minneapolis-St Paul, the center of the Prey universe. This is  perhaps the biggest weakness of the book.  The reader doesn't get a real  feel for the locale, or the feeling Sandford spent much time there.  LA was  just  a name, with its associated collection of street names, but it could  have been almost anywhere else, for all I knew.  I had no sense of the  atmosphere that comes out in Michael Connelly's work.<br />The other obvious  difference is the main character is female.  I find it fascinating when an  author writes on a protagonist of the opposite gender.  In this case,  Sandford is more successful, as far as I can tell as a male. I never had  the feeling that the character was straying into a male  perspective.<br />Other aspects of the book were also good.  Unlike most of  the Prey material, this book was a bit more mystery, a bit less thriller.   In mysteries, the question is what did happen, while in thrillers, the  question is only what will happen.  And Sandford plays fair.   He provides  enough clues for educated conjecture without making it easy on the reader  to guess the answer.<br />I also liked the characters.  Probing characters  isn't Sandford's strong point in any of his work.  But I found the ones in  this book likeable and, unlike other reviewers, I found them  believable.<br />So I recommend Night Crew.  It was a lot of fun to read, and  I didn't feel at all cheated at the end.  It isn't Lucas Davenport, but it  doesn't need to be.	2000-08-24
US	50164914	R2JHJ1Y06XLSYS	0425141233	586426642	Winter Prey	Books	5	3	5	N	N	A memorable new chapter of Prey	Winter Prey maintains the standard of excellence established by Sandford  in the previous volumes of the Prey series.  In this work, he's able to  knit together multiple themes into a coherent work. Among these themes is  one with which, perhaps surprisingly, he hasn't really dealt in the  preceding four books -- the extreme cold of the North.  The cultural and  natural effects of this are both memorably represented. But perhaps the  strongest theme of the book is that of the manipulation of young minds.   It's noteworthy that in the preview of this book at the end of Silent Prey,  the Iceman was instead called the Teacher.  The name is tragically  appropriate.<br />Maybe the least strong feature of Sandford's writing is the  depth with which he represents his characters.  Yet by reading the series  in order, this isn't as much as a problem as it would be for a standalone  work.  From book to book, characters, especially Lucas, become more  familiar as they develop and progress.  For this reason and others I  strongly recommend these books be read in sequence.<br />Still, this book,  more than Silent Prey, works on its own.  While I give it the highest  rating, five stars, as part of the series, by itself it's still worth four.	2000-08-19
US	50164914	R3VVJLJRF7VMRM	0425137562	525066589	Silent Prey	Books	5	1	1	N	N	Sandford achieves excellence	I was amazed to find that, as much as I enjoyed Eyes of Prey, Silent Prey  was even better.  This book has it all -- characters, suspense, mystery,  scenery, and plot.  If Sandford's Prey series is, as it should be, read in  sequence (Rules, Shadow, Eyes, Silent,...), this book provides a nice  continuity by revisiting characters from the preceding works.   I don't  give 5-star ratings lightly -- this is the first in the series which I  think justifies it.  But in this book the series reaches a level of  excellence which is really memorable.	2000-08-14

This is #3 in the series, which is best read in sequence (I somewhat regret not starting at Rules of Prey).<br />This a well done work!  It really has all the components -- memorable characters, suspense, and, rare for Sandford, even a little dose of mystery.  Underlying the whole story is a theme of drug use, which is presented from different perspectives with a refreshingly neutral perspective.  I strongly recommend this one, but after you've read the first two.<br />The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is I reserve that rating for truly excellent books... I think this falls just a bit short of that level.	2000-08-11
US	50164914	R2H6OBBC08MWNF	042512343X	754912560	Poodle Springs	Books	4	2	2	N	N	Good on its own merit	This is Parker's book, as first four chapters, credited to Chandler, are a very small part of it.  Thus this book can be evaluated on several tiers: (1) Is it a seamless continuation of the style and character development of  Chandler's work? (2) Is it a valid representation of Chandler's characters,  perhaps in the style of Parker?  (3) Is it a good book on its own?<br />I  haven't read Chandler, so I'll stick with (3).  This book is a good read.   The story, characters, and plot are sufficiently engaging that I found it  hard to put down, which is rare for me.  Parker really excels at detective  fiction, and this ranks with his best.<br />One issue is that Marlowe as  represented here is like Spenser's twin brother, so if you're tired of  Spenser, you'll be only moderately refreshed by the new  protagonist.<br />Another is that  Parker's love for Boston and New England  doesn't extend to LA, Hollywood, and &quot;Poodle Springs&quot; (Newberry  Springs?).   There's a shallowness in his description, which is perhaps  partially justified. But Michael Connelly, for example, does a much better  job of capturing a feel for life in the Los Angeles region.<br />But still I  recommend this book.  On it's own, it's a good, engaging detective novel.	2000-08-01

However, once I did, I found the characters and stories engaging.<br />All three stories in the book were good.  Timothy is an  interesting character, whose lifestyle matches the author's writing style  -- sparse.  I identified well with Timothy.  Other characters also have  their own personalities, although they aren't as strong as the main  character.<br />Overall, it's a good read, especially if you like New York,  where the stories take place.	2000-07-19

His representation of the San Antonio and  Austin cultures is wonderful.  However, the  &quot;mystery&quot; part of this book is a bit weak. Still, it's a very  worthwhile read, and I look forward to the softcover release of the third  book in the series.<br />Dan	2000-07-06

The characterizations of Duane and Chantel are well done, but the story truly strains the limits of credibility.  And Parker  seems to be stagnating with Spenser and crew -- there is little if anything  here fresh or interesting, especially since an earlier book in the series  already deals with gambling's influence on sports.  Crimson Joy, the last  book in the series before this one, was much better.	2000-04-29
