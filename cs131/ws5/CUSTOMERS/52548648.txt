In the case of this Jo Bannister suspense series featuring Brodie Farrell, our reflection is on the nature of evil--real, true, and perverted evil--and on the price of commitment to justice.  Bannister's voice in this series is the voice of Daniel Hood, a voice of prophecy not unlike the Biblical Daniel--Hood sees much, and is blessed and tortured with understanding.  Even the pragmatic Brodie cannot fathom the evil that Daniel comes to understand and must dramatically act upon in the blazing last scene of this novel.  Perhaps you are thinking that I am failing miserably as a reviewer, because I'm not recounting any of the action and I'm not extending a tantalizing commentary on the plot.  But it's a tough reading experience, and a hard moment of reflection onces you've read the last words.  And when I put the book down, and stared numbly into space, I could only echo the last words of the book:\\"Finally Brodie sighed brokenly. \\"Oh, Daniel.\\"	2005-10-01

Apparently, there's nothing in the world that a good dream can't cure--including some tortured labyrinths of human behavior.  The book is mildly amusing: there's good description and informative background.  But the characters are caricatures and the plot is bogged down with dreams which do little to advance the plot.  Final result, in the last few seconds before the book put me to sleep, I had some pretty graphic dreams of my own....	2005-09-24

As I read through this in an afternoon, that's what I was thinking: this mystery reminds me of every sitcom I knew and loved, and some I didn't.  It's funny, but it plays for the quick guffaw, not the introspective chuckle.  And sometimes it plays for the slip-on-banana-peel howl.  It's an amusement of the shallow variety--good entertainment without much involvement.  And if that's your mood--it's good at what it does.  And there are no commercials.	2005-08-13

It's long, of course, and written as if the reader had all the time in the world to let the book fall in her lap while she stares off into space, thinking about racial prejudice, cosmic injustices, poverty, social inequality, and sexual perversion.  It meanders through the plot, pausing to look at perversions and personalities.  It examines its heroes: an ill-kept and socially inept police-woman, a black man who fights to retain his dignity and self-respect, and Lynley--who in his desire to save them all, wrong-headedly jeopardizes his own life and that of the innocent people he loves.  In the end, the reader must indeed reread the world's newspapers and evaluate the hysteria of the current Schiavo debates in the light of the shocking angst at the end of this novel.  \\"With No One as Witness\\"?  Indeed, we are all witnesses--this novel is a commentary on our world.  I recommend it, and encourage readers to allow time for pondering its many insights.	2005-04-23

Each one is good: well-written, with a sturdy plot and craftsman-like prose.  \\"Serpents Trail\\" meets my expectations of an enjoyable and interesting mystery experience.  And, I really enjoyed Maxie....she  is a new kind of heroine: older, practical, fiercely independent, and with an understanding of human behavior which comes with insight and experience.  There's nothing unbelievable in this tale: it's the story of how we were growing up in the '50's...innocent, conventional, afraid of social censure.  And the results of that environment lead to pain, deep secrets, obsession, and murder. And yes, the ending surprised me until I thought, as Maxie does in the final pages of the book, \\"Of course, that's the way it had to have been.  Funny I didn't see the clues.\\"  Like Maxie, I remember those early years, the treacherous innocence, and the painful effect they so often had on us survivors. This book is indeed a well-written story, with a thoughtful and sad conclusion.	2005-03-24

I had to struggle to finish this book--me, who loves mysteries and enjoys almost every minute of even the worst of them!  But \\"Footprints in the Butter\\" was a real turn-off--contrived, trite, and predictable.  I knew who did it by page 109 (and I'm a little slow on these things) and the thought of enduring another 140 pages of a shallow heroine, bad jokes, and terrible puns caused me to turn to the last page.

One of the reasons I enjoy reading mysteries is for the background: the settings, the characters, the specialized information.  But even the quaint setting of &quot;Painted Lady&quot; couldn't save this book: the writing is amateurish, the plot mechanisms unbelievable, and the background filled with every novice trick imaginable.  Lest I sound too harsh, consider paper with a watermark that coincidently assumes the shape of a murdered woman when wet--that's the crux of the mystery here. And then there are ghosts, which obediently appear during a seance and drop clues. There are the shallow characters, as well: the college professor who will poison and murder to get job security, but who only makes a cameo appearance in the book as a handy way to turn the plot.  And what passes for background information in the Elderhostel setting is a repeated description of the cologne worn by the hero, the number of bathroom stops on the bus trip, and the contents of the daily box lunch.<br />I've read other novels by Peter Abresch, and found them mildly entertaining.  But perhaps I've read one too many: this one was merely a bore.	2004-04-29

Because the pure fact of the matter is, one reviewer is right: this is a mystery lacking in traditional plot and character development that I often praise in my other reviews (and have been critical when these elements are absent). But you know, all the way through this book I didn't care!  Why? Because there is a stunning use of background, wit, and message.  I was caught up in the pollution issue, the life of the Metis people, and the Robert Parker-like spare prose and dialogue.  This book left me energised politically and intellectually, and aware of having experienced a thoroughly enjoyable weekend because of it.<br />I encourage you to read it.	2004-03-29

I can't add much to Mr. Nuss' review: I started to read this series as a fan of Steve Hamilton and really became facinated with the nature settings and the characterization.  I do think Heywood is better at the capsulized characters than the more extended ones: I found the women in the book particularly elusive as believable characters--but I loved Limpy and Honeypat and Scaffidi, and all the exotic backwoods populace captured in this novel. And as a long-time watcher of Michigan's political and economic climate as well as the various iterations of the Department of Natural Resources, I felt very at home with the various political struggles which are so much a part of this book.<br />The Woods Cop series is a discovery I'm glad I made: I have the next installment ready and waiting to begin this afternoon.	2004-02-07

A part of the time was in reading, and a part of the time was thinking about what I had read--a compliment to this novel. There's a great curiosity in me about living in a country colder and snowier than where I am now.  There's also a fascination with living simply, without 'things' and meaningless complications. And finally, I have a deep-seated admiration for Community, the way people live together and at the same time separately, respecting each other's differences.  <BR>   All of those ideas are in this book, along with a rip-roaring plot and some very good writing craftsmanship.

I have read a lot of mysteries in my time, and Death on a Silver Platter is among the notably worst. The characters are shallow and the action is over-plotted....  Meanwhile, we wade through a twisted plot filled with false relationships, superficial characters, and deceit and debauchery, which is supposed to pass for 'psychology' but instead is only a fleeting reference to every popular hang-up in today's world: abused children, illigitimate offspring, gays, and nymphomanics. None of these personalities are examined in any depth, their quirks are merely excuses for the plot to move forward.  As a result, one finishes the novel feeling tricked, unenlightened, and un-amused.	2003-12-22

Other reviews here have summarized the plot...suffice it to say the plot is simple, and the characters are complex. That's what makes this novel so compelling: it's populated by real people, albeit not always very nice ones, and these people are making their way in a world which is not friendly to them.  There's a layer of philosophy here too: organized religion, mysticism, and the occult all come into play as the story unfolds.  It's a satisfyingly deep and well-written book, and I recommend it highly.	2003-12-13

But in Dymmoch's first mystery novel, cats are metaphors for human behavior: independent, intelligent, and irrepressible.  Dymmoch writes about them well...in fact, Dymmoch is an excellent writer in general.  \\"The Man Who Understood Cats\\" is well written, and fairly well constructed, though I felt it a bit repetitive: the sequence of murders seemed similarly devised (suicides made to look like murders) and the ultimate discovery of the murder was an anticlimax: he was the least developed of characters and his motives remain unclear.<br />However, I enjoyed the setting and the partnership of cop and shrink, and I am looking forward to reading the next book in this series.	2003-06-22

I enjoyed the novel, as I have enjoyed all of Hamilton's Alex McKnight novels, not only because of the setting, but also because Hamilton is a darn good writer!  You don't have to be from Nowhere to understand the need to isolate yourself in the beauty of Northern Michigan, and to fear and resent the greed which drives men to murder each other and despoil the environment.  These are the themes of Steve Hamilton's books: weave them through an engrossing plot line filled with action and intelligence and you have this latest in the Alex McKnight series--and perhaps the best.	2003-06-22

True, I think, but what makes this novel even more unsettling is the thick, murky atmostphere of mistrust and suspicion depicted in the countries of Eastern<BR>Europe in the early 1990's. It is difficult for Americans to empathize with the fear and suspicion of those times, which is the setting of this novel.  The repressive and grim background  is indeed the leading force in the novel: it is a force which still impacts life in much of the Eastern Bloc today, accompanied by suspicion and corruption.<br />Against that setting, then, the characters assume heroic proportions. The desire of Wallander to do his job well and bring closure to the deaths, the courage of Major Liepa to confront corruption, and the passion of Baiba Liepa to revenge the murder of her husband--all assume epic dimensions when viewed against the social backdrop. The plot is thickened by the lies, fear, and deceit by which even the ordinary citizen must survive. The labyrinth is constructed with masterful prose and an observant eye, hallmarks of Mankell's craft as a writer.<br />\\"Dogs of Riga\\" is a classic of the genre. More complex and better crafted than the typical police procedural, it is a 'must read' for the epicurean mystery reader.	2003-05-28

It would be easy to categorize \\"Echos of Lies\\" a 'thriller' or a good mystery, but to do so would be to take the easy way out.  Jo Bannister's novel certainly fits those superficial descriptions--in fact, it rates most highly in the suspense department. But in all fairness to the author, there is much more going on here.  \\"Echos of Lies\\" is an examination of lies, and lies about lies.  Not only is the kidnapping of a young child a lie, all of the relationships which surround Sophie are filled with untruths and pain. And each of the characters who participates in her rescue must create their own deceptions and wrestle with the question of the destructive nature of truth.  When should they lie? When is it better to tell a half-truth, or no truth at all?  At the beginning of the novel, Daniel Hood is tortured relentlessly for information: the first words he speaks in chapter one are \\"I don't know...\\".<br />And he doesn't know.  Miraculously, he survives physically, and confronts his torturers. Miraculously, he unravels the mysteris surrounding kidnapping and death.  And at the end, the truth is too destructive to be told.  The last sentence of the book is Daniel's lie to the police inspector: \\"No,\\" he lied. \\"She never knew, and I never told her.\\"<br />This book is truly good writing.  More than just a challenging read or a thriller, it contains a penetrating depth of thought which makes it intellectually satisfying as well.	2003-05-26

As Westerners know, the confrontations between men and women are often acrimonious. Many books, with positions ranging from the militant to the yielding, have been written on the subject.  But this small novel, &quot;The Kalahari Typing School for Men&quot;, gently and quietly explores the relationships between men and women, and wisely and quietly illustrates the virtues of respect and patience as people learn to live together.<br />Yes, this is a 'detective' novel, and it's also a folk tale, an allegory, and a spiritual journey for all of the characters--and the reader.  The heroine, Precious Ramotswe, returns in The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency Series to confront a number of problems: a client who needs to make amends to important women in his life, an adopted son who is reaching puberty, a fiance who is fragile but growing stronger, an assistant who wants a man and finds one, and competition for her business with an obnoixious male detective.<br />But Precious is a well-rounded lady in her late thirties who possesses wisdom, maturity, and directness and sensibility. In less than 200 pages of this deceptively simple and exquisitely crafted novel, the problems are solved and--yes--the men learn to type.<br />The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency Series is a wonderful one. It is set in Botswana, where people mend tea cups rather than throw them away, the simplicity and dignity of the lifestyle is in itself a lesson.	2003-05-04

And I didn't want to, either--because I didn't want the experience of reading it to end.  &quot;In the Bleak Midwinter&quot; is one of the most skillfully crafted mysteries I've ever read: the plot is focused, and moves rapidly through the various personalities enmeshed in it: the priest, the police chief, the congregation, the tragic love story.  It's notable, too, for the characters we DON'T meet but who hover over the action: the chief's wife and the dead young mother.

At least one review has called Les Roberts a 'hard-boiled' writer.  Not so!  &quot;The Indian Sign&quot; is a mystery of intricate structure, and overtones of Greek tragedy...with traditional elements from the tragic hero/stoic Indian grandfather to the chorus of whining women who populate the novel and comment mournfully on the action. And it all rests upon the human shoulders of Milan, the flawed detective whose very human-ness moves the action to the surprising ending.	2002-11-18

Yes, there were good moments in this book, and a glimmering of history which redeems it.  But in a world saturated with holocaust stories, Paretsky's use of this background and character motivation was neither exceptional nor believable.  And in a genre which depends on strong characters, suspense, and careful plotting, the obsession with the WW II background causes the novel to trip and stumble, and the reader to yawn and wish the book would come to an end.	2002-11-18

I always get excited when I seem Mary Daheim's name as the author of a new bed-and-breakfast mystery...or at least I always USED to get excited.  &quot;Suture Self&quot; takes place in a hospital--the ultimate bed and breakfast--and is as cutsey and improbable as its title implies. The largest problem is the location, as you might guess: it's difficult to have three murders on your floor, have the various characters wander in your room and confess, and observe the hit and run from your hospital window. It just doesn't work.  And the humor that Daheim usually exhibits doesn't work either: it's strained and artificial, filled with weak puns and plays on words.<br />I'm saddened to see Daheim turn out such a weak product: this is a formulaic novel based on her past work but, unlike the hospital  in which it is set, the novel is  sterile and lacking in credibility and color.	2002-01-27

Whatever the reason, &quot;A Deadly Quiet&quot; is one of the best I've read in recent months.  Christopher Lane's prose is masterful, and evocative of the shivering stillness and sheets of snow.

I didn't care about them, and they didn't stop long enough to include me in the events.

I know it's not politically correct to pan a book on Amazon.Com...or at least other readers don't rate your review very highly if it is negative.  But I gotta tell you, this is one terrible book.<br />To begin, this book is just plain badly written. Ripley's prose style is commercial, trite, and melodramatic. The characters have 'pregnant pauses' and 'deep breathing', their eyes  'aswirl with tears'. The Sedona policeman scowls, and it is 'like observing a glaring, albino pumpkin as the lit candle in its skull transmogrified its face from pumpkin to devil.' Talk about tortured metaphors....<br />The characters don't save the bad prose, either.  They are stereotypes of New Agers who slip in and out of dark closets in floaty gowns and damp jockey shorts, carrying crystal skulls and beads.<br />The mystery itself has to do with who swiped the crystal skulls (named Maggie and Azul) at a conference of New Age devotees, and who goes among the bizarre population commiting murder now and then.<br />If there is a reality to the whole sordid mess, it is that the reader doesn't really care whodoneit, nor does the reader care about the crazies to whom it was done. Nor about the crystal skulls. When I finished, my 'eyes were aswirl with tears'....of boredom.	2001-08-05

Parker has a recipe for constructing a novel--lots of action, violence, rich and powerful criminals, and the characters of Spenser and his entourage. This novel is no different, as other reviewers have pointed out.<br />But what saves it is Parker's wonderful writing style: the ability to draw characters with a few simple brushstrokes, the wry humor and innate morality of Spenser, and the wealth of detail and background.<br />Hugger Mugger is one of the best Spenser-recipe novels Parker has written.

As in Smith's other novels of Russian life there is darkness, ambiguity and shadow. Much of the novel takes place in the dark, among ruins, with the central character wearing a heavy black overcoat even in the tropical heat. As Arkady Renko slides in and out of ruined buildings and the murky pollution of Havana Bay so too this novel evokes the destruction of greed and the loneliness and depravity of the soul.  <br />That this most Russian atmosphere is set in Havana, Cuba in the bright glare of the tropical sun is Martin Cruz Smith's statement of the enduring and universal nature of human depravity.  <br />But the heaviness of the novel is offset by the brilliance of detail, the writer's descriptions of Havana and its inhabitants, and of the sociology of life under the reign of Castro. The seduction of the small love story and the unravelling of motives, actions  and consequences make this a most worthwhile investment of a reader's time and imagination.	2001-07-02

The gun doesn't fire, the bad guy isn't killed, and none of us watch the well-deserved revenge we all so badly wanted.<br />But Dr. Purdue is gonna get him!  He is gonna make the Birdman twist in the wind. He sets an elaborate plot into motion, and it works!  Throughout the novel the Birdman sinks deeper and deeper into punishment, and the good guys win and win and win.  <br />So where's the suspense, you ask?  Well, for one thing we learn to have faith in Purdue's ability to anticipate the problems.  For another, his partnership with his wife Sarah saves the whole intricate design from disaster, despite their unconventional marriage arrangements.<br />And for the third, we find that the villan, who is indeed a villan, is not the REAL murderer...this whole giant concoction is designed to bring to justice the true 'bad guy', and in the last few pages, we open our eyes in surprise and shock.

Ron Weber's &quot;Catch and Keep&quot; is a good mystery. It has a good cast of characters, well drawn and true to life in Northern Michigan. The plot lines are twisted and interwoven: the environmental feuds, the Michigan militia, the challenges of human diversity--all of these are true to Northern Michigan as well.<br />And the description of the Borchard/Boardman, and of the town politics, and even the Big Boy turned brew pub and the tourist-clogged streets of Traverse City--all are realistic and well-described.<br />I should know: I live there! I have to say that not only has Weber selected an intriguing and beautiful area in which to set his mysteries, he has created real and believable characters and a fascinating plot line which has its foundation in Northern Michigan sociology and culture. <br />To my mind the fatal weakness in the novel is the understanding and portrayal of the women. Lucille, Sarah, and Allison are central to the action. It is the allure and secret of Lucille which brings the death of Allison and the passion of Sarah, not to mention the obsession of Mysterious Max. But Weber brings the reader no understanding of this motivation, no real empathy for the human tragedies displayed here.  It's a strangely academic and dispassionate view which leaves the reader puzzled and confused.	2001-07-01

Barry Maitland's second mystery, &quot;The Malcontenta&quot;, has all of that.<br />But what makes it an enjoyable five-stars is the wit and the characterization.  Maitland sees his world from a distance, a perspective which allows him some irony and wry humor as the novel unfolds...and gives him the latitude to create a bevvy of characters who are charming, intriguing, and very human.<br />This is a suberb mystery.

I've read Rick Riordan's novels, and I was most anxious for the arrival of this one.  Like it's predecessors, it's good--witty, self-deprecating, ironic, bright. There's lots of action--violence, mostly, with some pretty descriptive blood-and-gore scenes. And I enjoy the San Antonio setting--it's colorful and sharply drawn.<br />But there's a caution here: in my opinion, The Last King just isn't of the same caliber as the previous Tres novels: there are too many characters, too many subplots that take us nowhere, and too few characters the reader really cares about.  As a result, the ending seems an intellectual exercise in tying up loose ends, rather than a true conclusion that pulls together plot and character in some kind of meaningful discovery.<br />It's good, it's entertaining, but--in the end, it's rather a tedious bore.	2001-04-29

I found myself dozing off during the last ten pages--I had figured out whodunit and why, and I really didn't much care one way or the other.

In Pursuit of the Proper Sinner is a profound and intricate mystery, a stunning book!  It is so because it consists of layers upon layers of mysteries, each with its own victims and its own protagonists. Throughout the 600 tightly-written pages these characters interact with each other, and the layers of plot become interwoven, untangled, and enmeshed again.<br />The question is asked over and over: who is the 'proper sinner'? And for what crime?  If the title word 'proper' means 'appropriate', one must ask, for which crime? Murder? Pornography? Theft? Blackmail? Prositution? Insubordination? And if the title word 'proper' means 'possessed of propriety', then most of the many sinners in this intriguing novel qualify: they are all enamored of their own self worth and gratification--including Thomas Lynley and his partner Barbara Havers.<br />There is no resolution of the mysteries in this novel: there never can be a resolution to human frailty and the pain it causes. But in the end, a murderer is caught and the tangled  skeins rest coiled and ready for use again.<br />Hopefully it won't take Elizabeth George too long to weave another spell. I'll be waiting.	2001-04-15

Desiree Shapiro is a heroine who is usually good for a laugh.  She's human, funny, and fallible, and her perspective on the world makes her adventures quite delightful.<br />However, &quot;Murder Can Upset Your Mother&quot; is probably the weakest in this series of six novels by Selma Eichler.  The plot seems quite contrived, and filled with frustratingly false diversions--wedding dresses, food poisonings, and other events which don't contribute to either plot or characterization.<br />The ending, too, is formulaic: we knew who the murderer was, we even knew Desiree was going to catch him, and it was only a quirk of fate and a little sleight of handedness that the drugstore clerk identified the purchaser of the poison as quickly as she did.  And then, to add insult to injury, Eichler adds nothing less than a recipe for eggplant parmigiana. It's not even a particularly distinguished recipe, for heaven's sake...but it is in keeping with the mediocrity of the novel.	2001-03-26

With the introduction of Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro, Dennis Lehane takes on Robert Parker in his own turf...and gives Parker a real run for his money. Kenzie and Gennaro are great macho/macho-ess characters and Bubba the animal is an inspired foil. Add to that mix a full array of Irish, blacks, politicians, and a range moral and economic lowlife created with a skilled writer's touch: it's a strong beginning to a series of mystery novels.  I can't wait for the next one.	2001-03-06

There is little rapport with any of the characters, including Sam McCall. The background, which is one of political campaigns, might possibly be interesting if not so dry and specialized as it is in this book.  The environmental issues are reduced to the not-so-burning-question of 'will the yellow-backed minnow survive as a species', and the obvious answer is, &quot;who cares?&quot;.  The motive for murder is revealed by artifice: a newspaper story quoted in the last chapter.  And the prose is not deathless, but dead--and filled with needless typographical errors.  Consider, for instance, this quote: &quot;Without even a moment's hesitation, I raised my fun (sic) and fired.&quot; (p. 243)<br />Even on a snowy and boring Saturday afternoon, this is a novel to be missed.	2001-02-11

In my review of that book, I wondered if Barr was going to prove unable to meet the high standard of her previous excellent work.<br />In &quot;Deep South&quot;, Nevada Barr returns to the tip-top of my list of mystery writers with whose works I want to spend time! The story is well plotted, with many lines of suspense--all of which come together in a surprising and completely whole conclusion.  Add to the structural elegance of the novel the wonderful snapshots of the deep south: the good old boys, race and sexism, and the cloying sense of gentility masking a deep-seated moral decay.  Then, wrap plot and social comments together with a woman as central character--who is real and human and smart and strong.  And finally, add some beautiful descriptive prose.  There you have it! five stars for Nevada.<br />And by the way, that prose style deserves some of the reader's attention: as in her other novels, Barr has scenes that live on in our imaginations. Surviving a wild fire, crawling through a damp cave--these are images that stay with us after the book is finished.  In &quot;Deep South&quot;, the memorable scene for me is Anna's walk through the dank, dark Southern woods without a flashlight or the moon to guide her.  Sitting by a February fire in Northern Michigan, I could feel the moss and warm, damp ferns--and I was afraid.	2001-02-10

Add some witchcraft, some torture, some gruesome descriptions of dean humans and animals, covens of witches, and a baby-selling ring.  Toss in some poverty in some far-away place like Romania. Then set the whole thing in a remote Scottish town, and let the plot expand to encompass all of the aforementioned ingredients for, say, 400 pages. Give it a sensational name like &quot;The Death Pit&quot; and throw a few quotes on the cover like &quot;erotic energy&quot; and &quot;shocking secret&quot;. <br />And there you have it.

That's where Steve Hamilton's &quot;Winter of the Wolf Moon&quot; takes place--just across The Bridge from my home.  And I'm sitting here by my fire, reading this book, thinking that Alex McKnight could be my next door neighbor, the one with the small cabins and far too many snowmobiles screaming on the cold night air. I know those Indians, those casinos, and even the bars with the fireplaces and greasy hamburgers.<br />I didn't relate too well to the plot, I guess: I couldn't figure out why Dorothy Parrish had all those men chasing her around, including Alex. I didn't understand the presence of Molinov, or why a Russian was sitting in the middle of a Northern Michigan lake in an ice shanty, jigging with corpses and plugging his own men.<br />But somehow, I didn't care.  The action was exciting, and Steve Hamilton's sense of place and detail and his excellent prose style kept me sitting right there by my fire, finishing this novel in one sitting while outside the snowmobiles roared through the night.	2001-02-04

It is, first of all, beautifully written.  The narrative lines switch back and forth, skipping time and place, and are told in many voices--Indian, white, mythical, dreamers, the long dead.  Each voice is separate and yet joined in this awful tale of emerging horror. <br />And despite its complexity of voices and choruses, the novel  works.  Man's foolishness, evil, hatred, love, and courage wrap around the events of this book, the two days of suspense that the Walker family must undergo as the psychopath who stalks them works his long-planned evil.<br />J.A. Jance has written one of her best novels yet...not one of comforting stereotypes and afternoon melodrama, but one of the primal battle of good and evil. And with all that, The Kiss of Bees remains &quot;a novel of suspense&quot;, and an excellent one at that.	2001-01-27

And openness is a new characteristic for Kinsey Milhone. Always in the past 14 novels, we've glimpsed at her--she's almost a one dimensional assemblage of characteristics: exercise, junk food, neatness, generosity. It was almost as if Sue Grafton kept a list of personality traits and made sure that Kinsey exhibited them in each novel.<br />But this fifteenth in the series is different: Kinsey confronts her former husband and her former life, and the precipitous descision she made to leave both. The ramifications of her choice spelled disaster and pain for Mickey Magruder and -- ultimately -- for Kinsey the realization that Mickey was a hero of sorts.<br />Yes, this is an exiting mystery novel with the familiar excitment and color of Sue Grafton's excellent series.  But &quot;O&quot; is more: it is a portrait of an emerging woman who must learn to live with the sorrow of her past and present choices.	2001-01-27

It's descriptive, accurate, tense.  And usually, Buchanan's plots and characters catch me up as well.<br />But not this time.  Keppie, the serial murderess, is so wierd and wired that she is only an oddity, evoking no empathy from the reader.  Her victims gradually lose individuality and become  one senseless victim after another.  And Britt Montero, erstwhile girl journalist, ends up being stupid and self-indulgent: she does anything for the story, including ignoring those around her who desperately need her help.<br />So much for the characters.  It's also true that there is no mystery.  Keppie is a mass murderer.  Britt is a girl reporter in a dangerous situation.  Joey is a small boy who exists merely to arouse our sympathy, and then disappears.  The cops are after everybody. They catch Keppie, free Britt, and send Joey home.<br />But for the masterful prose style of Edna Buchanan, this novel deserves a miss.	2001-01-27

It is the story of a physically abusive relationship, and a documentary about how abuse insinuates itself from fathers to sons, often unacknowledged and unstopped. It's also a story of how the victims enable the abuser, be they mothers or wifes.<br />This is a book of many stories, however,and not all are sad.  There a good men in the book, and good women, too.  There are children who are loved and who are loving children.

There are some dry little jokes scattered about, and some clever puns, but not much in the way of plot to involve us or characters to care about. In the end, it is a relief to put the book down.

Usually I like Kate Fansler: she's an intelligent, logical woman whose wit and academic background add much to a mystery novel.  But even Kate's character couldn't transcend this dullish plot and improbable ending (I mean, after all, how do you get a man you have only met a couple of times to take off his clothes and show you the scar on his spine?).  And to base the conclusion of a novel on that artifice is neither believable or satisfying in a logical sense.	2001-01-10

As usual with Rita Mae Brown's books, I have an initial credibility gap when the animals start to talk.  But then I remember that they really function like the Greek chorus in the classic plays, and the comments are delightfully editorial and observative. I revel in the detail, too: the setting of the fox hunt, and the view that the fox hunt is a giant game with rules understood by people, horses, hounds, and foxes alike...that's a delightful perspective.  No, the murder isn't particularly important--it isn't meant to be.  The suspense comes from wondering which one of the two disgusting antagonists is gonna get done in, and the hope is---that they both will.      What's amazing about Brown is that she is able to prolong the suspense up to the very last ten pages: it's then that we find out who the murderer is, and what the motive is for the murder, and that--like the heroine, Sister--the reader feels happy about the demise of the man, and angry about the killing of the fox.     The novel exhibits a fine use of suspense and detail, and is a compelling look at social issues and behavior as well.	2001-01-09

Meredith Mitchell returns to England after years abroad with the British foreign service in Central Europe.  She settles in to a small town in the Cotswolds, is greeted by her old friend Chief Inspector Markby and her soon-to-be-murdered neighbor, Harriet Needham. There's lots of tea, horses, and heath-walkers in the course of events--even a handsome gypsy thrown in for good measure.

Abigail Pearson has a weak heart and--according to her daughter JoAnna--an addled brain.  Abigail lives alone in the family home and one night she suffers a heart 'attack', brought on by the appearance of the ghost of her husband.<br />The midnight visitor sets in motion a tornado of family events: Abigail's daughter and her hateful son argue over her fate, and her grandson and his pregnant young wife hover about, awaiting the promised legacy of the dark, ugly house--which they plan to sell to finance their start in life.<br />But events puzzle septuagenarian Emily Charters and her friend, Chicago detective Jeremy Ransom. They know the 'ghost' is human, and the torment of Abigail appears to have little motive, except for the nasty house that is all Abigail owns. What is the motive? What's the gain? And who begins killing off the players in this ill-fated, dysfunctional family?<br />The answers are surprising, and very real. &quot;Ransom Unpaid&quot; is a book about human motivation--greed, love, passion, and loneliness. It's well written, and is made more interesting by its character portrayal, particularly of the two old women.<br />I recommend it.	2000-12-09

It's descriptive, often intriguing in the construction of the Paris setting and characters. The plot has its moments, and the reader gets caught up in some very intriguing puzzles which inter-weave history, religion, and human passion. <br />But Cara Black has some fine tuning to do before she can become a truely good author.  First, simplify a little.  There are too many puzzles which are irrelevant, and details which don't add much to the progression of the story--fashionable coats, torn photographs, footprints leading nowhere.  There are a clutter of characters, too: many of them enter and exit without making much impression or contribution to the story.  <br />And finally, there's the heroine, Aimee. She's truely a superwoman: she can leap buildings, kick the heck out of some pretty strong men, and inspire some wolf whistles even after emerging from a garbage canister. She's good in bed, and great with computers. She carries her assistant, the dwarf, around like he's a rag doll, and she saves Paris from neo-Nazis.  By the end of the novel, the reader is truly tired--of the convoluted plot, of the over-populated landscape, and of Aimee.  It almost felt as if Cara Black was tired of it all as well: the ending came swiftly, suddenly, and without balancing out the complications of plot.<br />But in spite of those remarks, I will read another novel by this author: there's a great deal of promise in her writing and in her finished product.	2000-11-01

It isn't: Melrose Plant is the central character throughout most of the book.  As usual, Melrose is likeable and charming, with friends who are delightful characters, absurd representations of 'high society'.<br />In contrast to the froth is the underlying evil and perversion which is the impetus for the crimes and murders which take place. No, it's not pleasant subject material, but it is all too real--not even the gentle last scene can take away the bitter taste in our mouths.<br />But this is a good book: well-written and moving, with a plot line that is suspenseful and finely drawn. And it makes its point: no matter how much money and glamour one has, or how desperately one would like to escape the ugly side of human  behavior, evil is a reality for us all.	2000-10-15

Dick Francis is able to evoke vivid word pictures and draw fine characters with a minimum of strong, well-chosen words.  And as usual, he weaves a tale which is intricately involved in a specialized background.  For Francis fans, these observations aren't a surprise.  What is a surprise is the setting: weather forcasting! Airplanes.  Biology.  Radioactivity. What is a further surprise is that the novel was actually dull.  The plot itself strained credibility: a group of 'average' people who were brokering radioactive materials, spying, murdering each other, and breeding mushrooms and diseased cattle.  More than I could follow, or care about.<br />Keep your writing skills polished, Dick, but go back to the stables.  I liked you better on the racetrack.	2000-10-15

It is the story of a young woman who has lost her identity and continues to lose it as she finds herself deeper and deeper in a morass of passion, greed, bitterness, and sexuality.  Each way she turns, she finds a new persona for herself, and new victims.  Each shadowy profile she sees of herself is obliterated: she is beautiful, but hated; she is loved, and despised; she is rich, but poor. And she is a gentle human being who may also be a murderer.  <br />In the end, the relief comes not from finding out who is murdered and who has committed the crime, but from the simple act of knowing the truth, however shocking and ugly it may be.<br />This is a short book, but spare and beautiful. I recommend it.	2000-10-03

I enjoy, mostly, Kellerman's well-paced, evocative prose, and I find myself admiring his writing style and turning myself over to the book, regardless of where it is taking me and what twisted turning of plotline emerges.<br />Granted, &quot;Monster&quot; is convoluted and complex. There are many characters who play important roles, and much for the reader to assimilate.  The result is a book which takes its own time reaching its startling conclusions...don't expect to hurry through it. And don't expect a return to the characters of Alex and Milo--they are in the book, but only as a means to an end, not as persona in and of themselves.  Instead, the &quot;Monster&quot; is  populated by the mutants the name suggests.  <br />This is a good book. It's well written, carefully observed, and suspenseful. It just demands that the reader accept it on its own terms and move slowly and thoughtfully to the horrifying conclusion.	2000-10-01

Certainly &quot;Death du Jour&quot; began well: I enjoyed the writing--interesting characters and wonderfully evocative and detailed description.  I curled up on the couch and turned myself over to a pleasurable reading experience.  And it almost was...until the last quarter of the book. When Tempe's (whoever dreamed up that name?) sister becomes a part of the cult, and the unrelated threads all begin to be braided together in one unbelievable coincidence which spans Canada, the Carolina, Texas, and Belgium, and when the description of the final rescue bogged down in unnecessary detail--then I found myself dozing off and hoping that the book would be over.  After all, I reasoned, I'd read 350 pages, and I could make it through another 100. <br />But I sure was bored and fed up with the superficiality of the plot and innundated with biological and anthropological data. I'm glad the weekend is over! I can only wave two stars.	2000-10-01

This is the most tea-drinking-est mystery I've ever read!<br />I'm not being  flippant with that remark though: what the problem is with this novel is  that it's predictable,un-exciting, and filled with artifice.  The central  device is the characters-in-a-box setting: in this case, it's an artists'  colony in Woodstock. But so what?  The characters are all types, not  personalities: they could be anywhere, isolated and unable to leave.  The  murder is of a beautiful young authoress, who had the secret lowdown on the  murderer, of course.  Untangling the past is up to Claire, the heroine and  visiting writing instructor.  Claire has a Greek-chorus-friend in the  audacious child Meredith and a potential lover in the spiritual, wise  Indian guide named Two Joe.  It takes countless cups of tea, insights from  Meridith and solace from Two Joe before mystery is resolved in this mildly  amusing but all-too-predictable novel.	2000-08-28

From the very first page, when the letter  from Benton arrives a year after his 'death', to the last page, when the  murderer is identified, I was caught up in the characters, the plot, the  background, and suspense of this novel. My personal taste in the mystery  genre runs to novels which combine a richly textured setting with an  intellectually teasing plot--with, of course, a little action mixed in.   &quot;Black Notice&quot; has all of those elements along with Cornwell's  evocative prose and psychological insight.<br />In her immediately previous  novels, I felt Cornwell faltered some, and I feared she was losing her  edge--perhaps there were too many hastily written novels in a short period  of time.  But &quot;Black Notice&quot; is finely crafted and meticulously  researched (except for the very bad gaffe about using AOL in a government  setting)--Cornwell has returned to her previous fine form.	2000-08-27

It's always tricky for an author who is writing an addition to aseries of books to keep the integrity of the books preceding, and still write a book that can stand on its own.  &quot;Stray Kat Waltz&quot; leaves me bereft! <br />None-the-less, this is an intriguing story with an important background topic of spousal abuse and--probably--bi-polar disorder, as well as nursing home care and insurance fraud. These themes, plus a captivating plot line and deft characterization, make this novel a good choice for the mystery buff. I enjoyed it all the way through its surprising conclusion.	2000-08-20

Ultimately the core cannot be  severed by usual means: it is like a steel rod which holds the to center.   Heartwood is also the name of Billy Bob's home, the land farmed by his  father and the ranch which houses all that important to Billy Bob Holland.   <br />As the novel grows outward, Billy Bob and his values are indeed at the  center of it all.  The land, its history and its mystery, and the others  who love it are what Billy Bob must defend against those who would destroy  whatever stands in the way of the fulfillment of greed and sensual  desire.<br />The action of this novel swirls around Billy Bob: there are  murders, rapes, and human evil too obscene to be contemplated by most of  us. With a few deft words, James Lee Burke can bring to life the violent,  stupid, and twisted actions of greedy men--and Burke creates characters of  simplicity and goodness as well. These are the folks who populate the town  of Deaf Smith, Texas...or anywhere else, when we look closely.<br />It's not a  pretty sight, this look at life--but it's a real one, with compelling  lessons for us all.  James Lee Burke expands the mystery novel genre to a  new and challenging limit and creates and experience as strong and sound as  the core of the heartwood tree.	2000-08-15

I've read most of the other books in this series, and I've liked them a lot.  John Coffin is a curious creature--silent, stalwart, and at the same  time romantic and soft.  He's an ace detective with a white lap dog.  His  wife, Stella, is beautiful and talented, and driven to succeed as an  actress. She carries designer handbags and tells lies to those she loves,  including John.  <br />So, what we have are two enigmatic main characters and  a fluff of a dog, several murders, and the usual display of Gwendoline  Butler's flakes and perverts.  The plot is filled with twists and turns,  some of which lead to undisclosed past events and some of which are a  result of the characters' own dark secrets.<br />Do we have a good book?  Not  exactly.  Things do get logically put together in the end, and the motives  are sex, money, and revenge. But somehow, there's an integration lacking  here--too much of the plot and the characterization seems to be decorations  which are not integrated with function.  Like lace doilies on the arm of a  flowered chintz sofa, there's too much &quot;stuff&quot; to be anything but  a distraction.	2000-08-09

In rural  Texas, two murders keep Sheriff Dan Rhodes at the center of politics,  drugs, and gambling that surround a winning team. But as the sheriff  discovers, these murders aren't about people, they are about football. And  a winning team.  And keeping The Boys in the playoffs.    Not only is  &quot;Winning Can Be Murder&quot; an excellent mystery novel--well  constructed and populated with delightful characters, it is a comment on  social values of a small town. Throughout the action, a variety of small  town dignitaries exhort Sheriff Dan to solve the murders so the team won't  be distracted from winning the playoffs. He does, and the town will never  be the same.	2000-08-06

This book is the sixth in a series of Southern sisters (say THAT fast!) mysteries and like its predecessors, the gals are at it again.  One of the most humorous overtones  is their 'Southerness', their desire to be prim and proper ladies, and  still be the originals that they are. In this case, they join a ladies  investment club and solve a tangled tale of murder and greed.  Through it  all, their world is populated by incompetant officials, lecherous bankers,  and a next door neighbor man who is seen about town with a variety of  voluptous women.<br />The plot is skillfully told: Anne George is clearly a  writer who is a master at manipulating language for a colorful and  delightful reader experience.<br />This is a delightful book, and I am eagerly  awaiting the next in this series.	2000-07-04

This latest Joanna Brady mystery is a fairy tale, at least as far as the central character is concerned.  In it, Joanna--who has had her share of tragedy in the past--gets it all: the murderer, a nice man, a use for the  jewelry given her by her first husband, a daughter happy with her Mother's  choice of boyfriends, understanding inlaws, and professional  respect.<br />And, she gets to be the central character in another mystery by  J.A. Jance!  <br />I am a Jance fan, because I enjoy her fine writing skills  and tightly-plotted action lines.  Usually I like Jance's central  characters, too: J P Beaumont has depth in adversity in his battle with  alcohol, and Joanna Brady is a woman with a load of grief and guilt.  Somehow, though, in this novel Joanna is less real, more fantasy...and  because of that she slips into the realm of becoming a stereotypical  mystery novel heroine--beautiful, strong, intelligent, and invincible by  the normal adversity that would paralyze the rest of us.  <br />Still in all,  Outlaw Mountain is a good novel and an enjoyable reading experience, even  if the characterization isn't quite as mulilayered as Jance usually  develops.	2000-07-04

All of the elements are there...investigation, standard cop characters, junk food and bad coffee, and an unknown violent killer on the loose.<br />But it has an  additional element that saves the novel from the fate of some of its more  lackluster police procedure companions: it has a totally engaging and witty  heroine.  Alex Cooper is a smart, savvy, and classy lady...and well she  should be!  Her creator, Linda Fairstein, is a veteran of 20 years in the  DA Sex Crimes Unit in Manhattan, the very job Alex holds.  And Alex/Linda  bring to the novel a no-holds-barred look at this topic.  In addition, Alex  characterized as a real woman with a real career, one who cares about her  career, friends, and her life style.<br />The result is catchy, fun, and -- at  times -- shocking in its subject material.  Its a mystery well worth  picking up, with strong background, good plot, and some characters to care  about.	2000-06-06

This masterfully written novel opens with a terrific scene: the train porter wanders through the cars, picking up the detrius of a long night's travel. He finds a scarf, two raincoats, an umbrella, and a leak in the  heating system. Then he finds the corpse and his discovery sets off the  usual chain of events: ambulance, police, news reporters.<br />But the title  is &quot;The Sleeping-Car Murders&quot;: more than one.  And indeed, the  other passengers of car number 4 begin to die, violently and seemingly at  random. <br />Underlying these deaths, though, are the corrupt, evil, and  stupid motives of greed and ego. By the final pages, we realise that the  incidents are not random--yet even then the denoument is darkly  surprising.<br />Japrisot is a master writer.  His prose is spare and  evocative.  He is able to create memorable characters and dark suspense in  less than two hundred pages. He sweeps us up into a mystery which is  intricate and twisted, and he leaves us shocked and saddened by the evil of  human kind.	2000-05-26

Her Japanese aunt works hard at putting the finishing touches on her wayward niece, including lessons in flower arranging. As Rei  bows deeply and tries to follow the elaborate formal rituals of polite  society, she gets deeper and deeper in trouble: a corpse, an unacceptable  suitor, a philandering master teacher, and several attempted murders.  It's  the kind of wonderful setting in which the death threats are in haiku, the  flower shears are gruesome weapons, and any one of the oh-so-polite  Japanese has ample reason to have killed the victim. Rei is a thoroughly  likeable protagonist, the setting is evocative and finely drawn, and the  plot is filled with dark passion and unexpected twists and turns. I am  delighted with this book, and will read more novels by Sujata Massey.	2000-05-24

Lisa Robbins is psychiatrist, a woman whose world is populated by a patient who is stalking her, a husband who is a confirmed philanderer, an ex-priest cop, and an overprotective mother-in-law. Though Lisa is not the  criminal, nor is she the crime solver, this is her novel: it is about one  person's quarrel with the world and her suspicion of those who populate it.   It's a challenging mystery, densely populated, with a surprise ending. My  quarrel with the book is that it is rife with opportunities for interesting  character development and psychological insights, but none of the  characters are ever fully developed, and the reader is left with  impressions and shadows, not the sharp edges of well-defined  characterization.	2000-05-14

Have no doubt about it--if you enjoy a detailed setting, local color, well crafted plot, plenty of humor and human interest, some good writing, and a surprise ending, this is the book.  I enjoy the hero, Captain Bill Donovan.  He has a good  girlfriend, he's afraid of marriage, he's a recovering alcoholic, and a  self-taught Renaissance Man who enjoys learning and solves cases with his  intelligence and research.  The women in the book are the blackbelts and  the tough 'guys'; the men are less stereotypical and more human.  But the  main character is the City of New York, its ambiance and energy; Times  Square; and the Theater District.  Only in this setting could this story  occur...and that's a tribute to the quality of this book.	2000-05-09

Carrie, the heroine/sleuth is amusing: she's a frazzled relaxation therapist whose own deep-breathing and counting-backwards techniques don't always work for her--and no wonder! Carrie has almost  every predictable ingredient of the modern female detective novel going for  her, all in one book.  Count the ingredients: policeman boyfriend;  obnoxious ex-husband; meddling mother-in-law; teenaged children.  Add to  that some other familiar ingredients found in every mystery-story  kitchen--faithful friend, mistaken identity, lots of corpses, nicotine  poison and a missing handgun.  Whew! Lots to stir into 250 pages! But the  result is entertaining, if predictable. A little frothy, though--I'll vote  for a souffle.	2000-04-30

Two sisters bravely are making their way in the small-town South, selling antiques and caring for  their grandmother.  But grandma is murdered in her bed, the girls' antique  shop is destroyed and a good friend is killed, a mysterious gem and a hint  of grandma's secret past is unveiled, and--away we go! To England, and back  to New England--from The Big Island to a small island refuge of a wealthy  family, from a dog show to a horror show. And then a complicated (and  slightly unbelievable) ending when the murderer is revealed and the  17-year-silence of the younger sister is miraculously broken as she speaks  the words to solve the mystery.<br />Through it all, there are moments of wit  and humor to lighten the tone and cause a chuckle from the reader. And  there is certainly an inventive plot to keep us amused.	2000-04-30

It's short--in pages, and in time-line, and it's not overly burdened with plotting or diverting details.  It is, in a word, elegant. The events (a murder, a missing girl, a palette of suspects) are set against the backdrop  of a rock concert, complete with egotistical stars and fawning sycophants,  spoiled fans and irate neighbors.  But underlying it all are the basic  human failings of self-absorption and greed and it is these motivations  which lead to the horror and the desperation of the characters and their  actions. Rendell is, as usual, an incisive observer of the dark side of  humanity, and a writer who can portray the consequences with the short,  deft strokes of a master craftsman.	2000-04-30

Frankly, I don't  remember the exact date of Buddy's death myself, but that WAS my senior  year in high school in a small midwestern town, and I do remember much of  the setting and the evocative details of &quot;The Day the Music  Died&quot;.  The accuracy is there, as is the emotions and the social  pressures of that age: this story of abortion, murder, and jealousy is in  itself a tale of the repressed '50's.  It's populated by my long-forgotten  friends in poodle skirts and saddle shoes, their uptight parents and  repressed aunts and uncles, and the bipolar behavior of a teenaged  generation breaking loose from the past. This a wonderful mystery novel:  well written, well designed, and suspenseful. I'm anxiously waiting for  more novels by Ed Gorman.	2000-04-29

If you read mystery stories, as I do, to provide logic in an often illogical world, Cat in an Indigo Mood isn't going to meet that demand. Douglas' books are clever and quirky, fun and fantastic--but never filled  with logic and deduction in the traditional 'mystery novel' sense. The  characters themselves are an odd mixture of strange traits and exotic  behaviors. Many of them don't really fit into the plot line, and have no  reason for being in the novel, other than being delightfully flamboyant and  unusual. The reader must accept this and admire them for what they are in  and of themselves.  But don't expect these creatures to further the plot,  or even reappear again in this novel.  And expect some of the characters to  be dogs and cats who are smarter and more believable than their human  counterparts.      When I am in Las Vegas, I am always aware that the city  I see is a total amusement, built  for that reason only.  There are  gondolas through shopping malls and volcanos atop buildings, garnished with  neon and feather exotica.  The Midnight Louie mystery series is a lot like  that: a lot of enjoyable fuss and floss, an amusement that defies reality.	2000-04-21

And some nerdy guys who are developing major technological  breakthroughs in artificial intellegence (hence the robot and the boat. Get  it?) Add a car chase down a rocky mountain road and a shoot-em-up battle in  a gun shop and five dead people--this is a thrill-a-minute book in less  than 300 pages.

Susan Holtzer's other University of Michigan mysteries are a joy to read: Anneke and Karl are well developed, likeable characters and the University setting is an integral part of the unfolding of events.    But &quot;The  Silly Season&quot; doesn't continue with the same fine writing and skill.   Holtzer admits she's trying for a 'farce', an entr'acte, something light  and humorous. What she ends up with is a monumental bore.    The murder (of  a character so poorly developed we don't much care whether he's dead or  not) is set among some supposed UFO sightings, and the action is populated  by some cartoon-like, one dimensional Believers, who squabble among each  other like hungry ducks fighting over breadcrumbs of ideas. Anneke and Karl  are back--the policeman and his fiancee whom he improbably invites to  witness all kinds of action--and Zoe the student reporter and her  superficial friends. The story is bogged in UFO lore, and shallow people  argue and play tricks on each other and somebody even murders one of them.   But by the time the reader discovers that the UFOs are a lie and the murder  is real, the book has degenerated to a farce and the only truth is his  yawn.	2000-04-12

I've read 'em all...and Spenser and Hawk are always macho Spenser and Hawk, and Susan is perfect, and smart, and beautiful, and thin. Nothing much is different in &quot;Hush Money&quot;--except that there are two  plots which play off each other, both revolving around masculinity and  sexuality and the distortions that each can bring to human lives. That  lends a little depth to the action line, I think. Parker's writing style is  as spare and humorous as it always has been: delightful dialogue and punchy  chapter endings, and--something I hadn't realized before--nicely evocative  descriptions.  I was in Boston when I read this book, and so I slipped over  to Harvard Square and looked at it through Robert Parker's eyes. It's all  there, every wonderful detail. It's good stuff.	2000-04-12

These Pattern People are pasted  into a predictable plot line and mounted in a collage of scenes from the  Los Angeles we all know and love--windy roads, bad traffic, smog, slimy  characters, and corrupt cops.<br />Guess the only reason I gave the book three  stars is that I like the flashbacks...that technique relieves the screaming  boredom to a small extent.<br />Read the earlier books of Robert Crais.

Consider the hateful teenaged  daughter who holds her mother hostage, the mother who refused to belive her  daughter is a spoiled and greedy brat, and the cross-dressing computer geek  whose desire for money leads him to murder and theft.<br />All of this  intrigue is set in Minneapolis, a colorful city described in finely-drawn  detail and with obvious appreciation.<br />What holds it all together is Our  Hero, Holland Taylor...detective, martial arts expert, and jokester.  You  gotta like Taylor as he wisecracks his way through the action, strongarms  the ugly guys, and uncovers the perverted values of life around him.<br />As a  matter of fact, you gotta like this book!

I think it was the endless ferry rides...and the bifurcation  of the plot between the hospital room dramas (and melodramas) of Anna's  personal life and the crumbling ruins of the old hospital on Island II. It  was, perhaps, the overly dramatic symbolism of the island vs. the teeming  city, the worship  of Lady Liberty contrasted with the skinheads and the  partyboats who populate the novel, etc., etc.  I even began to see  symbolism in the bird droppings and Anna's last name, there was so much  literary contrivance.  And finally, there is the overly inflated and puffed  writing style which Barr uses heavily--long sentences loaded with  descriptors drag across the pages with increasing frequency.<br />Mind you, I  still enjoy a Nevada Barr novel and I look forward to the next one. But I  think in &quot;Liberty Falling&quot; Nevada Barr has not maintained her  earlier promise as a good all-around writer and teller of great stories.	2000-04-05

I am intrigued as I read the reviews of this book by how many reviewers commented on the 'character flaws' they saw in &quot;Prime Cut&quot; and how few commented on the novel itself. I think there's a reason for this.  Anyone who has lived and worked in a small town knows that life can be  pretty pedestrian by Big Apple standards, and so it would seem that this  plot (high fashion novels, real estate developments, politics, and life  among the greedy rich) might be pretty fantastic stuff for a small, sleepy  mountain town. But the element of fantasy doesn't hold for the characters:  Goldie, our erstwhile heroine, has a temper, a big mouth, and a fear of her  teenage son; Arch, her son, is greeting his manhood with bravado and  hormones; Tom, her policeman-husband, is making a terrible mess in the  kitchen with his carpetry attempts; and many of the other characters are  like some of our own neighbors--ill tempered, boorish, and not too bright.  The novel LOOKS like fantasy, and SOUNDS like real life, an incongruous  combination.  It's got several plot lines to keep us reading and racing to  the end, and some delectable recipes which will slow us down and clog our  arteries. In the last analysis it's a delightful dessert: a smooth creme  brulee with a tint of tangy citrus, as Goldie would say.	2000-03-12

I remember discussing the insights with a devout Catholic friend, and the suspense with another friend, an addicted mystery novel reader. But with &quot;No  Greater Love&quot;, I am hesitant about passing the book on to the folks  with whom I share books, in fear that they may think I am encouraging them  to spend their time reading it.  I certainly am not! This is a boring  book. The &quot;mystery&quot; structure is a gimmick--four pages of  prologue which are supposed to set the scene and carry the suspense  throughout an otherwise dull novel. The philosophical examination is  outdated as well: the role of women in the church, priestly politics, the  aftermath of Vatican II. Somehow it all seems cloistered and out of touch  with the real world--an outdated ideology populated with allegorical  characters who represent concepts, not people.  Four pages of italicized  prologue can't save 285 pages of boredom.	2000-03-08

It features identical twins who are opposites, mothers who  are all too believable, a witchy murder victim who deserves what she got, a  hint of feminism, and some decent writing--not the least of which is the  technique of using a twin to tell the story in alternating voices.

Carl Hiaasen does it masterfully well, Patricia Cornwell has  a long way to go before she gets a grip on humor and satire.	2000-01-07

I can't help but want to compare  the two novels, but that would be unfair: they are two entirely different  fictional types, and they each must stand alone.  Together, though, they  are complementary experiences.      Of the two, Ron Querry has a more  lyric, almost poetic style. The plot is thinner than Hillerman's, and  perhaps doesn't even do very well at bringing superstition, medicine, and  folk healing together. That criticism (if it is one) is irrelevant to the  impact of the book, with it's beautiful prose and sharp characterization.  Of particular note is the chapter &quot;Hashke&quot;, which takes place in  the Short Mountain Cafe, populated by the smoking, vacant eyed waitress and  the gum popping cashier in her tight plum-colored jeans and decorated  fingernails. Like the rest of the book, it's great prose--evocative,  precise, and moving.	1999-10-07

They were about people with real problems, real crises.  Then Rina got too good to be true, and Peter turned into a simp, and the plot lines got more outlandish in compensation  for the lack of characters.<br />In Moon Music, we have the end of the  slide--the pits, in fact. There's nothing believable or in the least bit  likeable about the characters in this book.  They are mutants (duh..that's  what radiation does to you...must be a moral here!) who are moral hybrids  and perverts.  They create their own hells, and Faye Kellerman creates a  lurid plot line.  Like the sinking sand at the end of the novel, the book  pulls at you, offers no foothold, and no bottom.  <br />I think Faye ought to  let Jonathan write the novels from now on: maybe she needs to take up  gardening or chamber music.	1999-08-08

As a reader of three mystery novels a week (average), I know there isn't much new in the plotting of a book--the formula is pretty familiar to me.  But this is one novel in which I didn't want the mysteries to be solved,  because then the book would end.  Blanch would take her adopted children  and her all-too-normal middle-aged frustrations and go home from the posh  resort--and I would lose a friend. Blanche and I don't share an ethnic or  social background, but we sure do share a lot of frustrations with teenaged  children, social climbers, middle-aged bodies, and fickle men.<br />And, it's  Blanche's quick wit and humanity that enables her to solve the mystery at  the same time she provides a valuable insight into her life and values, and  into my own.	1999-06-02

As an avid mystery reader, I am discriminating about giving 5 stars--but I had no hesitation with this well-crafted novel.  Solving the murders is, of course, the glue that holds  this book together...but it is the interplay between the three sisters who  have returned home to share memories, lovers, children and parents that  makes this a reading experience that is compelling and worthwhile, and far  more than just entertainment. The book is well written, too: good  description, nice characterization--an all around enjoyable mystery novel,  and one of the freshest and appealing stories I've read in a long time.	1999-01-26
