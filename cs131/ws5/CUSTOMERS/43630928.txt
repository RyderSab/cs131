Since defenses of the status quo regarding animal use have not been as forthcoming, Machan's book is a welcome, but disappointing, contribution to the debates.<br />Machan argues that the idea of animal rights is \\"a fiction\\" and \\"a trick.\\"  This is because a being has rights - it is wrong to harm it for pleasure or even serious benefits  - only if it has a \\"moral nature,\\" i.e., a \\"capacity\\" to see the difference between right and wrong and choose accordingly (pp. xv, 10).  Machan says humans are of that \\"kind\\" and animals are not and so concludes that humans have rights and animals have none.<br />But these arguments are imprecise: true, only humans have this capacity, but only some humans, not all.  Thus, his theory of rights seems to provide no protection for vulnerable humans who are not moral agents and so lack the moral nature he describes.<br />Machan disagrees: he argues that, contrary to appearances, human babies and severely mentally challenged individuals do not \\"lack moral agency altogether\\" (p. 16) and thus they have rights on his theory.  To see this, however, he says that we must consider them as they would exist \\"normally, not abnormally\\" and focus on the \\"healthy cases, not the special or exceptional ones\\" (p. 16; cf. pp. 38, 40).  Apparently, Machan thinks that since \\"normal\\" human beings are moral agents, abnormal humans are moral agents as well.  But this inference is clearly illegitimate: while exceptional humans' characteristics include some properties they share with normal humans (e.g., being biologically human), it is not true that, in general, all features of normal beings are shared by abnormal beings: e.g., quadriplegics and cancer patients are in their unfortunate conditions even though normal, healthy humans - whom they share much with - are not.<br />So, in the absence of arguments to the contrary, the fact that normal humans are moral agents does not make abnormal humans moral agents.  Thus, they do not meet Machan's necessary condition for rights; his defense of the rights of vulnerable humans fails and thereby so does his argument that animals have no moral rights.  His criticism of one implausible theory of rights - that if someone merely has an interest in something, then he or she has a right to that thing - does little to defend his position either.  <br />Machan's other main argument against animal rights is surprising.  He claims that if animals have the right to not be harmed at the hands of moral agents, then they also have that right against \\"politically incorrect\\" animals who, as he repeatedly observes throughout the book, are not moral agents (p. 12).  He argues that since they don't have that latter right (i.e., animals don't have rights against other animals), they don't have the former right (i.e., they have no rights against us).  Basically he suggests that - when it suits our pleasure - it is morally permissible for us to act like some animals and kill other animals.  Thankfully Machan does not endorse our imitating some animals by our eating our offspring (or our excrement), but since chickens, pigs, cows, rats, mice, and most primates are primarily vegetarian, they would surely welcome our imitation in that regard.<br />One important, surprising and encouraging remark might help resolve this ambivalence: Machan suggests that one might be \\"morally remiss\\" for not breaking the law to \\"invade\\" a neighbor's private property to rescue a cat who was being tortured by the neighbor, the cat's owner (p. 22).  If this is Machan's true view, then he clearly does not believe that humans should always come first and the Animal and Earth Liberation Fronts, as well as more moderate animal and environmental advocates, have found an ally in a most surprising place.	2004-07-16

Most of the chapters in this book seem to be written by scientists, not academic philosophers or ethicists.  So, unfortunately, they tend to not be very subtle, sophisticiated or carefully argued.  I'd recommend something written by specialists in ethics, not scientists, to learn more about how to reasonably address some of the ethical issues that confront scientists.  Almost any bioethics anthology edited by philosophers would do that. <br />I borrowed this book from the libary mostly because I was interested in looking at the chapters on animal experimentation.

He argues that since there are so many ways utility can be 'measured' (long term, short-term, utility of acts, rules, motives, etc.) and utilitarianism doesn't supply any principled answer to which measurement is *the* relevant measurement, utilitarianism is an indeterminate doctrine.  <br />It seems to me that a lot of these essays are founded on the simple mistaken conflation of workable decision making proceedures and criteria for actions' moral status.  If the basic utilitarian idea is that intrinsic goods should be maximized, then people should think about moral questions in whatever way will maximize the production of intrinsic goods.  If following certain rules will do this (and following the rules isn't *intrinsically* good, let's suppose), then fine; if not, then fine too. Once one has accepted utilitarianism, it's a largely empirical question how one should think about moral issues, not a philosophical one.	2003-08-12

It shows how the scientific study of animals, especially their cognitive abilities, has transformed our understanding of them. Animals and Science traces our evolving understanding of animal pain and considers its moral relevance to humans. It discusses Darwin's belief-shattering notion that species differences are not absolute, then traces its impact to the present day.<br />Ultimately, Animals and Science is about the nature of science-the kinds of questions science can and cannot answer, and the role of theory in shaping the interpretation of evidence.<br /> <BR>Features <BR>12 thought-provoking essays trace the evolution of our ideas about animals and their impact on science, medicine, and society<BR>The book includes an extensive collection of primary source documents, ranging from Thomas Aquinas's Summa contra Gentiles to Peter Singer's Animal Liberation<BR> <BR>Highlights <BR>Explores the moral debate ignited by the scientific discovery that animals and humans experience pain the same way, and chronicles the resulting emergence of animal welfare groups<BR>Details how comparative anatomy and vivisection in the 16th and 17th centuries revealed structural similarities between humans and animals<br />Niall Shanks is professor of philosophy and adjunct professor of biological sciences at East Tennessee State University, Johnson City, TN.

The students really liked the book.  I think they found him much more readable, easy-to-understand and convincing than Tom Regan or Peter Singer.  Rowlands has a rather \\"hip\\" writing style as well; more enjoyable than standard academic prose.  <br />Rowland's moral perspective is basically this: an action is morally OK only if you'd be willing to allow it to happen *IF* you didn't know who you were.  So, racist actions are wrong because you wouldn't want people to treat you that way if you were of race X; sexist actions are wrong because you wouldn't want to be treated that way if you were of sex Y. <br />Similarly, if you didn't know if you were a human or a non-human, would you want a system might allow you to suffer greatly and die young so that others could experience the (comparatively trivial) pleasures of eating you?  Or would you want a system where you could be tortured and killed in a lab to satisfy some scientists' curiosity, or electrocuted or gassed so someone could wear your skin and try to look cool (but actually look like an idiot)?  Definitely not!  Rowlands argues that since it would be irrational to choose such a world -- if you didn't know your species -- it's immoral for these things to happen in the actual world.  Basically, it comes down to seeing things from the others' point of view, walking in their shoes (or paws).  <br />This is a really great book (the forward by Colin McGinn is excellent as well); everyone should read it and see practical ethics at its best. It should be yet another thorn in the side of those who who torture and kill animals for fun and profit, as well as those who support them, and have nothing of any merit to say in their own defense. <br />One thing the book lacks is a \\"for further reading\\". ...	2003-05-26

Thompson's main goal is to criticize consequentialism but it appears that most consequentialists don't even accept the consequentialism that is her target, namely some kind of view that says we should promote *goodness simpliciter*, NOT goodness for sentient beings, goodness for persons, other states that are intrinsically good or whatever.  Thompson has an odd target and even if she refutes it, it's not clear what difference it makes to most other consequentialist theories.

Today, that book is in print, and you should  <BR>add this one to your summer reading list: ETERNAL TREBLINKA by Charles Patterson. I have just been informed by Mr. Patterson that his Eternal Treblinka has been nominated for the Pulitzer Prize. After reading Eternal Treblinka, I wrote this: <br />The flight from Newark, New Jersey, to Portland Oregon lasted six hours. On the plane, I read the rough draft version of \\"Eternal Treblinka,\\" an extraordinary book written by Charles Patterson that equates the real life and death experiences of ten billion farm animals raised each year for human consumption to the same Nazi atrocities suffered by six million Jews who became Hitler's \\"Final Solution.\\" <br />This is one of the best written, best researched animal rights books that I've ever had the pleasure to preview. Fresh from the memory of having read about Jews stuffed into cattle cars as they were being transported to the slaughterhouses of Aushwitz and Dachau, I myself became witness to the twenty-first century's foremost example of man's inhumanity to other living creatures. Our tortured kin. The animal holocaust. <br />Last Thursday morning, I drove from Portland to Mount St. Helens in Washington State. I had been attending the Raw Foods Festival in Portland, and found a few hours in between my talks to visit the scene of America's greatest natural volcanic disaster. On this hot summer day, I drove across a bridge spanning the cascading Columbia River, separating Portland from Vancouver. There next to my car was a 40-foot long silver van with holes large enough to see through. <br />Inside of the truck were dairy cows. They were packed tightly together-with no room to lie down. The cows had served man's purpose. Each individual lived her short lifetime of stress, first birthing a child who would be immediately taken from <BR>her, then injected with hormones that would painfully stretch her udder, depleting calcium from her own bones so that she would generate enough milk to fill 100 half-pint containers for school children to drink each day. Her ancestors naturally produced enough milk to have filled just four of those same containers. <br />The cow whose eyes I look into for just one moment would be made to suffer through hours or days of driving hundreds or thousands of miles to what was to become a dairyman's final solution. <br />Yesterday she died a violent death shared by 10,000 of her sisters. <br />Today she will share that same fate with 10,000 other Guernsey and Holstein cows on Route 80 or Route 66 or I-95, in Kansas, New Jersey, or Florida, on highways and neighborhoods where your children and mine sleep comfortably unaware of the predestined doom for living beings who have done nothing to merit such treatment. <br />Tomorrow the same, and the day after that. Eternal death. Eternal slaughter. Eternal Treblinka. <br />A holocaust occurs while meat eaters turn the other way, denying that such horrors could possibly exist. Were the German and Polish people who knew the fate of those trucked to Buchenwald and Treblinka any less moral or guilty than those who comprehend the truth about what really happens to farm animals? <br />I followed the truck for a bit until it veered off to the left, and I continued my drive in another direction. I took the high road, and she took the low road, and her look will forever haunt me. Her body will produce 2,000 quarter-pounders for one of many fast food franchises. <br />Her anus and cheeks, arms and legs, back and udder will be served so that others can have it their way. Today's slaughter will feed 20,000,000 people, and the year's tally of Elsie and her sisters will add up to seven billion kids meals served. <br />I feel the slaughterhouse. I hear the screams and know their fear. I smell the sweat and blood and suffer their pain. I internalize the agony and distress of transported animals. I envision the once green fields in which these animals grazed and the cold metallic ramp and smell of warm sticky blood that flows on the slaughterhouse floor and stains the psyche of us all. <br />I imagine the stun gun bolt to the head. The upside-down hoisting and the sliced  neck artery. The animal who chokes on her blood, and the man who slices off her legs as she kicks in fear from the ensuing pain of butchery. The last fifteen seconds of a death that no creature deserves. The arrogance of a man who eats the flesh and dares not consider the origin of each bite. <br />Nobel Prize-winning author Isaac Bashevis Singer once wrote about a man's love for his departed pet mouse: <br /> \\"What do they know-all these scholars, all these philosophers, all the leaders of the world - about such as you? They have convinced  themselves that man, the worst transgressor of all the species, is the crown of creation. All other creatures were created merely to provide him with food, pelts, to be tormented, exterminated.  In relation to them, all people are Nazis; for the animals it is an eternal Treblinka.\\" <br />I ceased eating meat four years ago. I now look at my pet dog, whom my daughters rescued from a shelter one day before she was due to be injected with man's final solution. I have come to love her. <br />Her name is Tykee, the goddess of fortune. Is she unlike the baby lamb or calf who is separated from her mother and shipped to the exterminator? I reflect on the Amazon parrot who recognizes me and sings \\"hello\\" when I visit my parents. Does the bird with green feathers differ significantly from the chicken with white plumage? <br />Do they not feel pain and deserve the right to live? I cannot eat them. I can no longer be then cause for their pain, although I once was a part of their genocide. I once denied responsibility for the acts of terror that occurred outside of my vision...outside of my consciousness. Their bodies were cut into smaller pieces and were broiled, baked, and fried. <br />Oh,that same crime of arrogance to which I now plead guilty! My penitence? Community service. I explain the act to meat eaters, and some turn their backs on me. Close their eyes. Shut their <BR>ears. Who wishes to deal with the truth and reality of death? <br />Arriving at Mount St. Helens, I carefully read one plaque after another, taking note of performances both heroic and ironic. I consider the day that once silenced the birds and boiled to death fish in the streams. A blink in the eye of geological <BR>time that stripped the landscape of the color green, divested pine trees of their needles and scattered whole trees like matchsticks across barren mountain tops. <br />I examined the original seismographs and warnings from hundreds of scientists to the residents to evacuate their homes and come to terms with an absolute truth. I became dumfounded by the arrogance of one man, Harry R. Truman, who lived alone in a cabin aside the lake below a mountain that would soon explode with the magnitude and power equivalent to 27,000 <BR>Hiroshima-type blasts. <br />A man who declined to leave that mountain. A man who denied a truth shared by others. An arrogant man who looked death in the face and refused to respect man's destiny. I try to imagine his final moment of sensibility. At the same time, in my own mind's eye I call upon the face of a cow in a truck on a bridge.\\"	2002-06-28

I found it to often presuppose that the reader was already fairly philosophically sophisticated, so I suspect the introductory student would get quite lost (and bored), unless the class were going at a quite slow speed (which is often the speed that good philosophy is done).  So, I don't think I'd recommend this book to students without much philosophy background.  It'd be good for more advanced students though. <br />The 'Notes' and 'For Further Reading' sections were full of good sources for scholars and students to track down.	2002-03-30

If you want to develop or improve your skills at identifying and evaluating arguments and reasoning (and you do, don't you?), this is the book for you.  Like no other text on critical thinking or informal logic, its clear, simple, precise and no-nonsense approach will help you become a clear and precise thinker.  Get a [used & cheap!] copy, study it, master it, and you will soon be able to see through much of the BS that is offered for and against all sorts of views, claims, beliefs, and policies.  On the positive side, you will learn what kinds of reasons would be good reasons to support various views and learn to rationally critique and defend your own beliefs and the reasons why you hold them.

One character is a compatiblist, the other a hard determinist, and the other an indeterminist-free willist.  While the free-willist's position sometimes seems to be presented as a rather weak position (perhaps it's difficult not to do this!), this book will very much help the introductory student see the forest for the trees in the free will debate.  This would be a good text to read before plunging into primary articles on the topic.  It's an entertaining book, the arguments are explicit, and there's very little fluff or irrelevant banter.	2002-01-29

It fails in both respects.  Those interested in the topics (and those who teach on the topic who try to give a balanced perspective on the issue) will have to wait for a future defense of the practice that actually engages the issues on a more scholarly level, especially with regards to the scientific aspects of the debate.<br />Two recent books, &quot;Brute Science: Dilemas of Animal Experimentation&quot; (by two philosophers and a scientist) and &quot;Sacred Cows and Golden Geese: The Human Cost of Experimentation on Animals,&quot; (by an MD and a DVM) have condemned the use of animals in medical research, product testing, and toxicology.  <br />Their condemnation is based on purely scientific reasons: small differences between species at the cellular level make it impossible to reliably extrapolate results from one species to another.  Since it can't be predicted how a drug will affect a mouse on the basis of how it affects a rat, it is all the more difficult to predict how a human will be affected by a drug, chemical or treatment on the basis of an animal's response.  <br />Thus, animals are poor models for human disease and physiological responses and so it's not in our best interest to use them as they are not a source of reliable information.  The details of medical history show that animal have not been reliable models; evolutionary theory explains why this is so.  <br />One not need have any views on &quot;animal rights&quot; or other philosophical matters to find vivisection highly suspect.  The historical and scientific case against the practice of trying to use one species to understand the diseases of another is strong, even on purely &quot;humanistic&quot; moral principles: if one wants the best for human health, it seems that spending resources on animal research is not a good investment; non-animal research methods are what bring the goods.  <br />The authors of the essays in this book do not adequately address the scientific objections to animal research.  They assert that animals have been and are essential to medical research (meaning, it couldn't be done without animals and were it stopped, medical progress would nearly stop), but they do not show how results from animal testing or research results from animals yields fruit for humans, and, most importantly, how those results could not have been obtained without animals (e.g., autopsies, clinical research, cellular research, technology).  They do not explain how animal researchers can infer useful information about humans, given the subtle, but extremely significant differences between species.  They do not address the objection from evolutionary theory and comparative physiology.  In fact, there is very little in the book about science at all, as it is all pitched at a very low level of scientific understanding.  This is unfortunate, since the critics of vivisection, at least above, argue for their positions in rather sophisticated manners, which presuppose at least a college-level understanding of biology.  <br />The historical claims in this book are poorly documented, and they fail to engage the critics responses.  Those who condemn animal research do not claim that animals were not used in the history of medicine: rather they argue that the use of animals was not necessary to whatever discoveries were made.  This can be shown through detailed careful studies of the history of medicine.  The authors of this book do not provide detailed histories, rather they merely assert that animals were necessary, but do not explain why this is so.  Their references are often suspect, as they often cite literature from animal research public relations and lobby organizations as sources of their history, not peer reviewed journals or professional-level histories of medicine.  <br />Unfortunately, none of the authors of this book are health professionals.It would have been helpful for their case had they been able to find an MD who could plausibly argue that he or she is able to provide the quality of care he or she does primarily because of animal research, not because of other research means.  <br />Throughout the book there is a lot of discussion about the tactics of animal rights activists.  This is wholly irrelevant to whether animal research is justified from scientific and/or moral points of view.  It is mentioned that throughout history people have nobly and rightly broken the law to fight injustice, but the question of whether the ALF and others are among this group is never discussed.  <br />With one exception, the book is philosophically disappointing. Singer's utilitarianism and Regan's rights view are misunderstood and very weak objections are leveled against them.  <br />Two authors argue for a &quot;Darwinian&quot; morality.  They argue that to not experiment on animals would be an evolutionary maladaptive strategy and so contrary to our own self interest, and so we should continue doing so.  This is surprising: usually morality is not defined in terms of self-interest, but if it were, this would very easily sanction exploiting other groups of humans as well, as it could easily be in our &quot;tribes&quot; advantage.  Perhaps these authors are unaware of the &quot;is--&gt;ought&quot; and &quot;can--&gt;should&quot; fallacies.  <br />One author argues that animals have the rights to be &quot;skinned,&quot; &quot;used in circuses, bullfights, cockfights, rodeos, etc.,&quot; to be hunted, and many more rights.  Also, animals have a &quot;special right&quot; to be &quot;the object of the culinary arts of Chinese and French chefs.&quot;  These are quite surprising rights to have.  <br />The final essay is quite good and is recommended.  The author shows just what one has to accept if one does not condemn animal experimentation on moral grounds.  <br />Generally, the essays in this book are disappointing.If there is a strong defense of vivisection, it is not to be found in this book.  Perhaps there will eventually be a book from the pro-vivisection side that is as scientifically and historically sophisticated and well-documented as the critics' books.  But this is doubtful.	2001-10-22
US	43630928	R2IUNT236SKD8Y	025202611X	578989527	Defending Animal Rights	Books	5	16	18	N	N	a brilliant collection of essays	In this collection of superbly-written and argued essays, Tom Regan, the leading defender of the moral rights of animals, restates and refines his main arguments that animals, like humans, have the right to be treated with respect and so not used by humans for food, clothing, experimental subjects, or entertainment.  <br />His arguments are strong and simple: if humans have rights (and lets suppose they do), why is this so?  What is it about humans that makes them have rights, that makes it wrong to kill them for food, entertainment, etc.?  It is very difficult to find plausible answers to those questions that do not imply that animals do not have rights as well.  Clearly Regan's critics have not.  <br />Those who challenge the status quo with respect to humanity's treatment of animals will find Regan's essays clear, carefully argued, and revealing of his great insight into moral philosophy and the moral life.  Defenders of the status quo--those who think that, by and large, society's treatment of animals is perfectly fine--have their difficult work cut out for them to reveal exactly where Regan's arguments have gone wrong.  <br />They need to explain exactly why, although it's wrong to kill and eat, hunt down, experiment on, or wear non-rational humans (e.g., infants, severly mentally challenged, anecephalics, the brain dead, etc.), it is perfectly OK to do these things to animals who have more advanced mental capacities and the same capacity to suffer.  <br />This is a very difficult challenge.  Regan responds to some (although, unfortunately probably not the best) of his critics on these points and shows that their criticisms either just *assume* that animals don't have rights and/or are riddled with argumentative and logical blunders.  Regan's critics are advised to take (or re-take) a logic course and learn what it is to &quot;beg the question&quot; and commit the &quot;fallacy of irrelevance&quot; before forming a new attack on Regan's arguments.  <br />Not all of Regan's essays are focused on ethics and animals.  One essay, &quot;Ivory Towers Should Not A Prison Make,&quot; concerns the challenges (and rewards) that academics, especially philosophers, face when publicly advocating for social change.  Politically or socially-active academics will find this essay to reveal great wisdom and insight.  <br />Regan also adopt the role of historian and documents that the objections raised in religious and scientific communities to abolishing slavery and for increasing rights for women, minorities, and homosexuals are very similar to the objections currently raised against the notion of animals having rights.  Regan shows that the &quot;Patterns of Resistance&quot; to fair and respectful treatment have been similar in all these &quot;liberation&quot; movements. <br />There is much in these essays of great wisdom and, often, beauty. They will appeal both to readers who already have an interest in ethics and animals and the animal rights movement.  They will also appeal to those who do not have this interest or background, but, hopefully--after reading these essays (and others like them)--soon will.	2001-10-18

Regan's section is where to begin. He argues that whether a being has rights (and which rights it has) depends on its psychological capacities, not its biological species per se. Since babies and mentally challenged humans (who aren't rational or autonomous) have the right not to be eaten, worn, experimented on, chased down and shot and their heads hung on the wall, etc., so do non-human animals, since their psychologies are of comparable, if not often greater, levels. QED. <br />Objections to Regan concern his general theory of rights, NOT whether animals have them, if anyone does (many plausible moralities deny &quot;rights&quot; in the sense Regan defends). <br />According to Cohen, animals do not have rights because they animals cannot engage in moral deliberation, act on principles, and be moral agents. <br />Many humans cannot cannot engage in moral deliberation, act on principles, and be moral agents and hvae the capacities that Cohen seems to think are necessary for having rights. But, most of us think it would be wrong to experiment on them and kill them, even if doing so would greatly advance our interests. Cohen agrees. But since some humans lack these capacities yet have rights, this shows that these capacities are not necessary for rights.  Cohen's denying rights to animals is arbitrary, a case of not treating beings with equal psychological capacities as equals: it is discrimination on the basis of species alone.  <br />Cohen replies that objections like this &quot;miss the point badly&quot; because human infants, the senile, and the severely mentally disabled &quot;have rights because they are human.&quot; He says that, &quot;The critical distinction is one of kind.&quot; Earlier Cohen said that the &quot;kind&quot; needed for rights possession was a moral and psychological kind; now he says that the relevant kind is the biological kind Homo sapiens. No justification is given for this switch and why humans who (evenpermanently) lack moral capacities have rights yet animals do not. <br />Cohen's reply to this objection--the so called &quot;argument from marginal cases&quot;--is unsuccessful and his main argument that animals do not have rights fails. Appeals to thinkers ranging from Aquinas and Augustine to Marx and Lenin, as well as appeals to &quot;immediate&quot; and &quot;certain&quot; intuitions, do little to defend his view either. His repeated ad hominem attacks on those who disagree with him do not help either. <br />Cohen also argues that animals don't have rights because it's in our interest to use them. It's scientificaly dubious that using animals for food and research is in our best interest (both vegetarian diets and human-based research are superior for meeting our needs), but questions about morality shouldn't be decided by appeal to self-interest anyway. Cohen's case that animals do not have rights is a disappointment.	2001-08-10
