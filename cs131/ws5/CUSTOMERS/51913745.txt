The events revolve around two &quot;tramps&quot;, although they are not refered to as such, and their life's agony. Vladimir especially feels isolated, for every day, it is as if he is the only one who remembers the past.  Is his friend Estragon so down in life that he purposefully represses each day (which is almost exactly the same as the next)?  This is very interesting in thought-provoking.

An integral part to any Shakespeare work is the presence of footnotes!  This book has a glossary, but it does not do any good because there is not sign in the actual text itself that one can look up specific words in the glossary.

For my whole life, I had heard about Macbeth, but knew little about the play itself, other than its setting (Scotland).  While I have not enjoyed some of the Shakespearean plays I have read, I truly enjoyed Macbeth.  The story is very psychologically stimulating; Lady Macbeth is an especially interesting character: ambitious, heartless, yet compassion that surfaces at times.  The whole issue of what fate is, when it is determined, how it is determined, how much of one's future is his fate, etc. is very thought-provoking!  Other than a few weak scenes where one has to wonder if Shakespeare was just getting a little too clever (like the lame reverse psychology Malcolm uses to test Macduff's loyalty; or Macduff's son's dying words &quot;He has killed me mother, Run away.&quot;)  Nonetheless, even better than Hamlet I would say (yet I know few will agree)	2000-12-11

Robin Cook's use of medicinal jargon separates makes the reader believe the veracity of the outbreak.  My only criticisms are that I believe the main character did not have a great reason as the book progressed, not to go the police; I also thought the resolution happened so quickly, that I was not quite sure what had happened to some of the characters in the climax......but maybe it is just me.  Nonetheless, this is excellent beach reading, and might even revive your fears of the dark.	2000-11-26

Her writing is filled with wit and humor.  Even at the most dramatic stages of the story, Kinsey Milhone (the first-person detective) will throw in a statement that will make you chuckle.  In addition, I liked the fact that the plot revolved around the well-to-do Wood family and the family intrigue that seems to accompany much of &quot;the aristocracy.&quot;  Good for what it tries to accomplish; nevertheless, I feel that Grafton's alphabet series has declined slightly since her first three novels.

As Mayor Orden (the mayor of the invaded town) says, even  if he is shot, a free people will rise to the occasion under a new leader.

As the traditional American frontier has basically ended, these symbolic stories of adventure and hardship do help to serve as a representation of challenges, but there are such better works that achieve these goals.  Even a novel like The Catcher in the Rye uses savvy to explain the ironies and  false pretenses that life offers.  Holden, like Buck, is faced with the  choice of how to adapt in a losing situation.  While you may now be  wondering how The Call of the Wild and this Salinger novel can be  paralleled, the point is that the theme is so universal and not restricted  by the plot, that there are many other works that accomplish similar goals.	2000-04-11

Binx and Kate are two extremely fascinating characters each searching for meaning in his or her own way.

While his philosophies on life are interesting, a recounting of each person he met (and basically each new person is once again won over by  the educated ascetic) becomes rather dull.  Also, an insert of the author's  own adventure is both vain and not essential.

This would have made for an  excellent short story used to support the ideas of H. David Thoreau, not an  entire book that rushes to the top of the superficial bestselling lists.

Much of the story, especially the first half, is filled with boring details  of life in Nebraska and unimportant events that occur in thier lives.   Characters are often times introduced superficially and then dug up again  later in the story, leaving the reader to feel that he or she is missing  something about the character being referred to.  Possibly someone who  enjoys the simple life and longs for the simple days of the past would get  more out of this book.	1999-08-21

Sinclair harshly criticizes the exploitations of capitalism and leads the reader to think more carefully about positive aspects of socialism.	1999-08-18

The plot is very &quot;on the surface&quot; and quick, possibly too quick.  More could have been done with character development,  and a more played out resolution could have been made.  The detective  Scudder could have had more dimensions to his personality, and more could  have been added about the details of his &quot;relationship&quot; with his  ex-wife and also more on how his hardened personality came to be.   Hopefully, some of his later Scudder novels were written better.	1999-08-06

Techniques used by the State to convict Bigger Thomas of the murder and rape of a younger, white  woman, is as interesting as Bigger's lawyer's explanation of how Whites  have caused these flaws in the Black society.  Very informative and  emotional.	1999-08-04

The importance of racism and religion continue to be stromg themes through the lives of each of the individuals that Faulkner follows.  While the  story is a little slow at times, Faulkner's unique style keeps the reader  interested and hookes.	1999-08-03

Many of the justifications that it uses in asserting  Christianity are the very things that atheists and agnostic disagree with.  For example, in one section, Lucy is the only one of the four children who  can see Aslan.  As a result, the other children have to follow her on Blind  Faith.  Well, blind faith here is necessary because we accept the faith  after knowing the truth.  In Christianity, we are expected to have blind  faith without knowing the truth.  Read this book to your child pr enjoy it  as an allegory as an adult, but be sure to talk about it with your children  also.	1999-05-30

I found all the stories to be repetitive thematically.  While it was better than say Crane's THE RED  BADGE OF COURAGE, it was not conveyed as intensly.  Remarque uses simple  words to try and convey powerful intense emotions, which was only somewhat  effective.  I did like reading something from the point of the losing  Germans, but I found it still dull.  Possibly someone who was in World War  II or in live combat situations would appreciate more the great losses  suffered by the protagonist.	1999-05-22

The arguments for communism are basically all the same, just told with different examples.  The protagonist's discovery that the word  &quot;I&quot; is not present in socialism is hardly a revalation to the  reader, only to the charcater.  This might be an effective book for someone  if they were alredy a communist or socialist, but people brought up in the  deomcratic and capitalist way of life will find that there are not too many  arguments that we have not heard.	1999-05-20

Basically, the philosophy of the Afrikaners could have been established in less than a page, instead of constantly &quot;quoting&quot; passages written by civil  rights leaders.  The main character's struggle, while both real and  symbolic, is one that is established, but not resolved.  Inspires some  thought, but not great.	1999-05-04

I have been able to have so many nights in which I would lie in bed for an hour just pondering the great ideas about the human nature that this book inspires.   Suspence and the Count's seemingly infinite wealth add to the intrigue.   (Though you do find out at the end just how much money he has!)  This book  can be read on so many levels, that anyone can get something out of this  book!	1999-04-25

It was very non-descriptive!  One did not even know where the action was taking place in many scenes.  Maybe I am too critical, but I  thought that the scene where Mrs. Roosevelt ventures into a strip club and  makes comments amd asks questions like, &quot;Oh, so is that what they call  a G string?&quot; was appealing to some sore ot lowly base instincts	1999-03-17

Of course, I would expect some repetition for effect, but some of the trivial  information was too often repeated.  Still, a good book.  If you liked  Fragments of Isabella, then you should enjoy this one.	1999-03-16

Still, the book presents a very rare case: a noble, who did not want to even be a  noble, is being unfairly held by the peasants who have seized control of  France and demand that all nobles be killed.  The book also can be  confusing at times.  This is basically, (in my opinion) like all Dickens'  works, average.	1999-03-03

His lack of confidence in his appearance hurts his overall anxiety level. He uses a handsome cadet's,  Christian's, looks to woo Roxanne with his (Cyrano's) own graceful words.  While unrealistic in nature, many of the morals of the story are presented  very cleverly. There are so many great lines in the play that are witty,  intriguing, or just funny! A great read for anyone.	1999-02-24

The exotic setting was fun, realistic,  and has inspired me to want to move to Spain to live for a few years when I  finnish college.  The wonderful tales of communal living is fascinating and  passionate!  A must read for 11-14 year olds!	1999-01-27

A great peace of literature that truly evinces the power of art.  Presenting a realistic view of Michelangelo as a man who lived and &quot;breathed best while carving the precious white marble,&quot; the  reader is able to live the life along side this man who cared about little  besides creating awesomeness (I believe terriblita in Italian, or a word of  that like.)  Feel every struggle along with him!  While sometimes the  historical information that his replete with a myriad of names gets  confusing, it is definately worth the read.  But do be prepared, I  calculated that this book laid out line to line would stretch about 2.6  miles in regular print!	1999-01-14

It was interesting at first to  compare the characters of the play to the same names we read about in  history books.  I felt that this is one of Shakespeare's most difficult  books to interpret in today's language.  Even though this edition does have  extensive foot (or in this book, side) notes, the reading process was  confusing having to look back in forth.  If you are just reading this play  to read some Shakespeare, try another less difficult Shakespeare work, like  A COMEDY OF ERRORS.  Thsi is much easier to understand, and for beginners,  you will probably enjoy it more.  But if you are a beginner looking for a  tragedy, try ROMEO and JULIET.  While the language can be confusing at  time, this classic story should really be read by all.	1998-10-08

The contradiction  between the Christians' contempt for &quot;Barabbas the Acquitted&quot; and  &quot;Christianity: Synonymous for 'Love'&quot; prove interesting.

(George Orwell's 1984 is my  favorite.)  This should be read by anyone, especially people exposed to  much diversity.  Throughout the masterpiece, I would think in my mind what  I thought would be the most effective cont nuation of the story from  whereever I was, and I would say 99 times out of 100 (No exageration!) the  book took the course that I thouught would be most effective.  If you are  looking for other books that empathize with the Jews, try EXODUS by Leon  Uris.  While EXODUS is not as good, it really gets you wrapped up in the  story.  READ THIS BOOK!	1998-09-10

I was  redy for entertaining, but cultured writing, new philosophic ideas, and  beautiful prose.  The only thing I found was philosophy, and not much if  that.  This book was probably much more appreciated at the time, for it was  truly a &quot;novel&quot; idea.  With all th enew science fiction and  horror novels of the time, the theme seems somewhat generic, and the  philosophic ideas presented about man are nice, but the story seems to be  put together hastily and without much consideration for details.  For  example, one second, Frankenstein (the creator of the monster) is studying  chemistry at a university, the next thing we know, he has the ability to  &quot;bestow life on an inatimate object!&quot;  Where did that come from?  Can we be any more random?  Such a complex story should have been longer  than 206 pages; perhaps a trilogy would have been more effective.  Only  read this if you are lookibg for a good thinking book, and have A LOT of  patience.	1998-08-24
