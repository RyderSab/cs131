In the last decade of the 18th century, William Henry Ireland really did produce a number of Shakespeare-related manuscripts (including a letter to the bard from Queen Elizabeth) that experts swore were authentic.  I know of no factual connection to Charles and Mary Lamb, but Mary's tragic history (somewhat telescoped here) dovetails nicely with that of Ireland, who, like Chatterton, was but a teenager when he committed his infamous forgeries, the most notorious of which was a \\"lost play\\" by Shakespeare entitled \\"Vortigern,\\" after the Dark-age British King.  Other sources give the full title of the play as \\"Vortigern and Rowena,\\" although this is never mentioned by Ackroyd, and there are other minor discrepancies as well (for instance, Ireland's so-called \\"patron\\" and source of the manuscripts is usually given as another young man and not a woman), but Ackroyd is not so much interested in the truth as in the \\"larger narrative.\\"  And a riveting narrative it is!  Along the way, we meet such period heavy hitters as Richard Brinsley Sheridan and Thomas de Quincey, and there are fine portraits of lesser-knowns such as Ireland's father, Samuel, an antiquarian who was ruined by the scandal, and Charles Lamb's circle of bibulous friends from the East India House, who stage a play of their own, portraying the \\"mechanicals\\" in Shakespeare's \\"Midsummer Night's Dream.\\"  The climax of the novel is a brilliantly realized staging of \\"Vortigern,\\" which may or may not have been the travesty it was later judged to be.  There is more attention to character and plot in \\"The Lambs of London\\" than is typical of Ackroyd's novels, thus making this one of his best.  I recommend it warmly.	2005-09-16

He is never less than a witty raconteur with an unswerving instinct for the mot juste.  As the present collection of short stories, \\"Fascination,\\" attests, he is also a brilliant ventriloquist, capable of embodying, alternately, an adolescent bicyclist, a 19-year-old asthmatic whose parents are both bodybuilders, a female performance artist, a writer named Edward with delusions of his own grandeur (in the collections's best two stories), and a host of dysfunctional middle-aged men.  These are narrators who are driven largely by \\"fascination\\" for unattainable love objects, like the American publisher in 1940s Cape Cod who meets \\"The Woman on the Beach with a Dog\\" and is capable of forgetting his own marriage even when hers intrudes.  The fascination here is in the unexpected twists and turns these stories take, including a side trip into Chekhovian territory in \\"The Pigeon.\\"  I enjoyed reading these stories; each is a testament to Boyd's mastery of the form; but I wasn't particularly engaged by any of them.  The plotting, to put it bluntly, is perfunctory.  I barely got interested in a character or situation, when the story concluded and I was shuffled on to the next character and situation.  I got the impression that these might be sketches for books that Boyd never got around to writing--compressed novels, as it were.  That being said, this is a much more satisfying collection than the earlier \\"The Destiny of Nathalie X,\\" which, with the exception of the mordantly funny title story (an insider's take on Hollywood), is even sketchier than \\"Fascination.\\"  Boyd, as his fans know from \\"On the Yankee Station\\" (his first collection of stories), \\"A Good Man in Africa,\\" and a raft of other books, is capable of so much more.  I'm certain Boyd has another comic masterpiece like \\"Stars and Bars\\" up his sleeve.  In the meantime, enjoy this collection for the jeu d'sprit it is.	2005-07-24

Each of the four, even Maureen, the mother of a \\"sick child,\\" is savvy enough to know about the drug culture--a simple overdose is quick and relatively painless--so why do they insist on throwing themselves off a building?  This is but one of many questions that will have readers scratching their heads at \\"A Long Way Down.\\"  The good news for pedestrian traffic, but the bad news for the rest of us, is that, once having met, the four decide to put off the big event for six weeks, in which time they hope to bond as a \\"gang.\\"  Now there's a Dr. Phil-worthy goal for the wounded and depressed!<br /><br />Here's the gang: Matthew is an ex-talk show host who thinks his prison sentence for having slept with a 15-year-old is unfair because he was \\"not a criminal\\" but \\"a television performer who made a mistake.\\"  Maureen is a mother whose adult life has been taken up by the needs of her disabled son.  Jess is eighteen going on eight, a rebel without a clue who peppers her every sentence with four-letter words.  Finally, J. J., the obligatory American in the mix (think film rights), is a washed-up musician whose bathroom library extends to Richard Yates (foreshadowing?) and Pauline Kael.  None of these people has a compelling reason for taking his or her own life, but the reader might, after putting up with these whiners for 333 pages.<br /><br />Believe it or not, Nick Hornby is one of my favorite writers.  Nothing will take away my pleasure in having read \\"About a Boy,\\" \\"High Fidelity,\\" and \\"Fever Pitch.\\"  I wasn't crazy about \\"How to be Good,\\" but it had its moments.  Still, \\"A Long Way Down\\" is a major disappointment.  When I think of all the Grand Guignol possibilities for a plot such as this--the gang might have drawn lots to kill one another, for instance, or they could have made a pact not to die, only to expire en masse in a subway crash--I can't help but feel let down by Hornby's failure of the imagination.  I know others of the author's fans will be outraged by my defection (alone again, naturally), but I take comfort from the mostly negative reviews on Amazon's UK site.  Apparently, \\"A Long Way Down\\" is more popular in America than in his native England.

They simply do not get translated.  Luckily, Rattawut Lapcharoensap has arrived to save the day.  Heavily courted by his publishers at Grove, Lapcharoensap, who is a mere 25, was born in Chicago and raised in Bangkok.  One secret to his success is that he writes in English.  Presently at work on a novel, he first came to the attention of his teachers when he enrolled in the University of Michigan's MFA program.  Within months of graduating, he had a contract to write two books.  The present work, \\"Sightseeing,\\" is a collection of short stories told from a variety of narrative perspectives, including that of an aging \\"farang\\" (western foreigner) who, following a stroke, comes to live with his son and his son's Thai wife in Bangkok, and a teenage girl, who is the horrified witness to her father's downfall once his luck changes and he begins losing at cockfighting.  Several of the stories are politically charged: in \\"Farangs,\\" a young man with a pet pig named Clint Eastwood, falls in love with an American girl: \\"I knew it was love when Clint Eastwood sniffed her crotch earlier that morning and the girl didn't scream or jump out of the sand or swat the pig like some of the other girls do.\\"  In \\"The Draft,\\" two young men gamble with their destinies when they pick cards in a draft lottery; one, named Wichu, is just beginning to understand that the fix is already in for his friend: \\"[Wichu] stands there and watches us pull our black cards from the urn, a blank look on his face . . . He never looks at me.  I want him to leave.  After a while, I can't look at him anymore.\\"  The writing is spare, the emotion wrenching.  If I have a complaint, it is simply that the last story, \\"Cockfighter,\\" goes on too long.  At ninety pages, it is the longest story in the book and so relentlessly downbeat that I became anxious for it to play itself out and for its author to stick in the final metaphorical knife.  With this one caveat, I can otherwise recommend \\"Sightseeing\\" unreservedly.  I eagerly await Lapcharoensap's second book, for which he is already contracted and which is rumored to be a novel.I can otherwise recommend \\"Sightseeing\\" unreservedly.

It's the story of a youthful hustler befriended by a john who gives him an unusual pet, a snail, the Harold of the title. The final showdown with a hotel desk clerk is probably the book's finest moment, but it helps to know that Oliver, the hustler, is probably oblivious to the pummeling he's given--he's endured far worse in life. In this case, Oliver's too focused on trying to shelter the mollusk in his palm to register the beating. Perhaps there's something happening on a Freudian level here: I can't help but think of Sir Lawrence Olivier's words to slave Tony Curtis in Spartacus on taste in the matter of oysters and snails. The book has a fragmentary feel, as if it were left over from one of the earlier works, The Heart is Deceitful Above All Things or Sarah, either one of which is a far richer, and much more deeply affecting, reading experience. Well, it is a short story, er, novella, after all, granted that it's decked out like a Christmas tree (it even has a bright green ribbon to mark your place). The introduction and afterword, the acknowledgements, and the illustrations run almost as long as the text.  To be fair, there is also an ample supply of the kind of richly textured prose that distinguished the earlier books, as in this passage regarding Oliver's relation to Larry, the john who gives him Harold: \\"Before bed I climb into the pajamas he got me, even though they're covered in dancing penguins, and I let him watch me do my balloon. And then I talk. I tell him what I tell no one until I fall asleep against him.\\" I'm looking forward to JT's third novel, rumored to be due out later this year, which should find him back on form. In the meantime, he'll be busy, writing lyrics for his band Thistle, hanging out with buds Tatum O'Neal and Debbie Harry, and otherwise hiding his megawatt celebrity under a bushel barrel. No matter what happens with the books, the next chapter in his life should be a corker.he next chapter in his life should be a corker.	2005-01-07

While lacking the scope of Hollinghurst's earlier novel, \\"The Swimming Pool Library,\\" and less ingratiating than \\"The Spell,\\" this is a very fine novel that has something important to say about Thatcher-era England (there, I managed to say it without using the word \\"go-go\\"). As in \\"The Spell,\\" however, it's often hard to reconcile the satire with Hollinghurst's obvious fascination with the very people he sets up to ridicule. Plus, as the novel's narrative center, Nick Guest (his last name says it all), is a bit too calculating to provide a touchstone character for the average reader (he is a 21-year-old virgin who answers a personal ad to have his first sex), and you may not care whether his fortunes rise or fall at story's end (they mostly rise--after all, Nick is only 25 at the conclusion of the novel and he manages to profit handsomely from his association with a wealthy lover). He is the man who came to dinner, with a vengeance. Having been invited home to spend the weekend by his college buddy, Toby Fedden (the attraction is hard to understand outside of the context of wealth and power), he stays on for four years, ostensibly to nursemaid the most fragile personality in the household, Toby's sister Catherine, who turns out to be the equal, in terms of calculation, not only of Nick, but of her own father, Gerald, a Tory MP whose ambitions run to having \\"the Lady\\" herself (Thatcher) as a houseguest. We're left with a suggestion that Nick might have AIDS, but there is little in the novel to support this--he is apparently a \\"top\\" who always uses protection and is regularly tested--although he is certainly unlucky in his lovers, both of whom get the disease. The pleasure in reading this novel, obviously influenced by James and Waugh, but also by Forster and Fitzgerald, is in the writing. Hollinghurst is a prose master who will have you reaching for the dictionary, as well as your French phrase book, to look up words like \\"enfilade\\" and \\"reredos\\" and phrases like \\"trou de gloire.\\"  He is also an expert on music, art, and antiquities. He is an aesthete with a soupcon of self-loathing that is often betrayed in his prose. He reserves some of his harshest satire for two rich American \\"Queens,\\" whose names, Treat Rush and Brad Craft, \\"sounded rather like porn actors.\\" It is these gentlemen who want to turn Nick's script for a Merchant-Ivory type production of James' \\"The Spoils of Poynton\\" into a vulgar sex romp (they particularly object to the name of James' heroine, Fleda Vetch). Nick may be a homosexual, but he is also a mensch; he doesn't take it up the chimney, nor does he resort to embarrassing camp. His sex (and drug) life apart, he is a bit of a voyeur, an \\"extra player\\" who is neither \\"visible\\" nor \\"relevant\\"--an \\"accidental eavesdropper.\\" Which probably explains why he has no friends in the Fedden household, when the excrement hits the fan. For students of literature who despair of nuance in the novel, \\"The Line of Beauty\\"--its very title, from a treatise on aesthetics by Hogarth, suggests a well-shaped arse as well as a line of cocaine--is for you. If Hollinghurst would only learn a little Jamesian detachment, he might indeed represent the best hope for the modern British novel.llinghurst is a prose master who will have you reaching for the dictionary, as well as your French phrase book, to look up words like \\"enfilade\\" and \\"reredos\\" and phrases like \\"trou de gloire.\\"  He is also an expert on music, art, and antiquities.

It consists of three lectures, originally delivered at the Globe in London, that treat the homosexual subtext in the Bard's poems and plays. It begins by  asking three questions: \\"Is it right to convey significances that could not have been in the mind of the author as he wrote? Is it, on the other hand, impossible to ignore them? How free can we be in our handling of texts from the past?\\" Great questions, all, and we shouldn't be too disappointed if the text doesn't offer any definitive answers. After all, the joy in reading a book like this is to spend an hour or two in the company of a man who has dedicated his career to Shakespeare and who knows him like the back of his hand. For instance, I had missed all that stuff about masturbation in Sonnet 4, in which the young male friend is accused of \\"having traffic with thyself alone.\\" As Dr. Johnson famously complained, Shakespeare couldn't resist a quibble. Another discovery involves a famous story by Oscar Wilde; I had no idea an \\"enlarged version\\" of \\"The Portrait of Mr. W.H.\\" existed.  Might the name of Wilde's boy player, Willie Hughes, be another pun? This will be, to some, a disappointingly brief offering, but Wells manages to pack more than a groat's worth of wit, and wisdom, into its pages.  One trusts that there will be more lectures and more books by this author, who leaves us with a promise: \\"I have by no means exhausted my subject.\\" His fans await the sequel.	2004-11-15

The book is a revelation.  I would like to know more about its publishing history.  Was it widely read?  When was it first available in the United States (I almost said \\"America,\\" but after reading Guevara's eloquent plea for a United Latin America, I won't make that mistake again)?  This tale of two friends from a middle-class background-one a medical student, the other a biochemist-hitting the road on a beat-up motorcycle (\\"La Poderosa II-the Mighty One) is both archetypal and mythic.  The discoveries they make are of a type that look forward to the men they will turn out to be.  Guevara continued to travel the rest of his life, even after he had married and fathered two children.  He died at a tragically young age, 39, in mysterious circumstances, and was buried in an unmarked grave in Bolivia.  The book is often poorly edited (I found a number of typos), but the Ocean Press edition more than compensates by providing several helpful features, including a chronology of Guevara's life, an introductory essay by his daughter, and a speech to medical students (potential \\"revolutionaries\\") from 1960.  Together, these features provide a much-needed context, especially for readers unfamiliar with Latin American history.  But the charm of the book lies in its evocation of the youthful \\"Che,\\" who is in so many ways a typical, as he puts it, \\"child\\" of his environment-the highly politicized Argentina of the Peron era.  The epiphany he achieves on his physical journey through post-colonial Chile, Peru, Colombia, and Venezuela is both a spiritual and a prophetic one: \\"I now knew...I knew that when the great guiding spirit cleaves humanity into two antagonistic halves, I would be with the people.\\"  But don't be put off.  Along the way, he and Alberto Granado have a raft of adventures, often side-splitting, and the editors have provided a couple of dozen photographs from the journey to keep you \\"in the picture.\\"  Above all, Guevara's personal charisma shines through the pages of this beautifully written book, which provides welcome insight into the heart and mind of a true revolutionary and man of the people.from the journey to keep you \\"in the picture.\\"  Above all, Guevara's personal charisma shines through the pages of this beautifully written book, which provides welcome insight into the heart and mind of a true revolutionary and man of the people.	2004-11-02

Chris himself is a fully realized character, a fan of Sherlock Holmes, whose worldview makes perfect sense as interpreted for us in Haddon's first-person narrative.  Unfortunately, the same cannot be said about the adult characters that surround him, most of whom appear to be suffering from Tourette's Syndrome.  I find it hard to believe that Chris' own father would regularly use such foul language in front of a child, but perhaps that's where the frustration of dealing with such a child leads him.  None of the adults is very sensitive to Chris's needs, with the possible exception of a counselor from school, Siobhan, who is referred to but little seen.  His mother, for example, is a complete cipher, especially when she is found to be living with a bounder.  Luckily for us, it's Chris who takes center stage in the novel, and his adventures are always fascinating, whether hiding out on a baggage \\"shelf\\" on a train to London or punching out a constable who presumes to lay hands on him.  He even manages to solve some complex mathematical equations along the way and to earn an A level in maths.  All in all, a flawed but rewarding read.	2004-09-03

Styan looks for clues to what the Bard envisioned in the texts of the plays themselves, as, for example, in this scene from &quot;The Winter's Tale,&quot; wherein a father wipes his son's nose: &quot;What! hast thou smutched thy nose? / They say it is a copy of mine. . . Come, captain, / We must be neat. . .&quot; as well as in the physical appearance of the Elizabethan stage, which allowed for a much greater flexibility in terms of blocking and grouping (not to mention violations of the unities) than the Victorian picture-frame stage of the last century.  Professor Styan's knowledge of the plays, which is encyclopedic, may lead to the occasional excess, but his analysis is difficult to argue with.  I am left with only one question: why doesn't the professor deal with what is undoubtedly Shakespeare's most famous stage direction, also from \\"The Winter's Tale\\": \\"Exit, pursued by a bear\\"?  Maybe he just didn't want to get into a discussion of whether or not a real bear, from a nearby bear-baiting arena, was used for the effect, and whether the bear could be relied upon to chase Antigonus upstage or downstage.	2004-07-03

The journey is fascinating.  Along the way, Ferguson offers tantalizing insights into the fantasy side of movies, as well as into the public and private lives of the actors who make them.  His choices run the gamut of hunks from Valentino to Tyrone Power, and Jan-Michael Vincent to Gael Garcia Bernal, with occasional forays into such related subjects as musclemen and porn stars.  There are extra-long articles on some of Ferguson's favorites, including Matt Dillon, Keanu Reeves, and Brad Pitt, but he also takes the time to pay homage to the occasional wannabe, such as Jack Beutel and Rodney Harvey.  The text has a tendency to go on too long, and Ferguson may at times appear overly obsessed with the pubic trail that leads from an actor's belly button into his speedo, but that's a minor quibble, and the kind of thing that will inevitably appeal to some readers.  Worse is the writer's frequent misplacement of his modifiers (as here on Bernie Schwarz's metamorphosis into Tony Curtis: \\"Like virtually every other Jew in town, a name change was mandated and he became Jimmy Curtis\\") and his problems with parallelism (as in this iconoclastic comment regarding \\"Some Like It Hot\\": \\"The film has been deified as one of the greatest screen comedies ever despite not being very funny and my opinion thankfully won't diminish the love audiences and critics have for it.\\"  In addition, as in \\"Bent Lens,\\" there is no index; there is, however, an appendix of sorts, which offers a credit each for a near-exhaustive list of actors, including many not treated in the main text.

One such \\"hero,\\" is Will Parker, who comes to New York from Idaho in 1983 in search of his friend, lover, and blood-brother, Charlie 2 Moons, whom he once betrayed in a moment of cowardice that has haunted him for two decades.  He is destined to spend six years in New York, at a time of crisis that demands sacrifice, not just from Will, but from his assortment of colorful friends, including perhaps the most tragic, Roosevelt Washington King, a one-time English professor cum drag queen/performance artist (and close friend of Elizabeth Taylor), who, having contracted AIDS, plans to exit this world in a \\"lucid compulsion to act polemically.\\" The action comes to a head for Will in a violent confrontation with an equestrian cop in Tompkins Square Park.  By this time, Will has \\"found\\" Charlie 2 Moons, lost one lover to suicide and another to madness, and seen his world nearly emptied of friends by AIDS.  This work represents a remarkable tight-rope walk for its author, as he veers between tragic realism and quotidian farce.  But, whereas he accomplished this feat quite nimbly in \\"The Man Who Fell in Love with the Moon,\\" here he often wavers.  Perhaps he identifies too closely with \\"Will of Heaven,\\" who is described as either a \\"handsome Einstein or intelligent Tom Selleck.\\" A glance at Spanbauer's picture on the back cover of my book reveals this as a spot-on description of the author himself, perhaps with a little Gene Shalit thrown in.  Spanbauer contracted AIDS while writing this book, which is a labor of love, dedicated to those who \\"have passed through the Door of the Dead.\\" If good intentions were enough, this would be a masterpiece.  As it is, \\"The City of Shy Hunters\\" is less of a novel than a collection of brilliant set-pieces, many of which will haunt the reader forever.

Oh, there are echoes of other great books, such as \\"One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest\\" and \\"Even Cowgirls Get the Blues\\" (other reviewers have mentioned \\"Little Big Man\\") but Tom Spanbauer's vision is unique: his subject is nothing less than the American identity, our dreams of reinvention and assilimilation, our fears and illusions, and the \\"human-being story\\" that is unique to each of us. Shed (tribal name Duivichi-un-Dua) begins life as the son as Buffalo Sweets, an Indian prostitute in the employ of Ida Richelieu, purveyor of Ida's Place, in Excellent, Idaho, a backwater in transition from frontier town to Morman community sometime at the beginning of the 20th century. When Billy Blizzard, who has been Ida's lover since he was thirteen, goes crazy, raping Shed and killing his mother, Shed goes to work for Ida as a male prostitute who lives \\"out-in-the-shed.\\" But when Alma Hatch, ex-Bible salesman and exotic dancer, pays to sleep with Shed, he panics and leaves town in search of his own identity. That's when he meets Dellwood Barker, the Man Who Fell in Love with the Moon. And that's only the beginning of this incredible story, which eventually brings Shed full circle to Excellent, where he, Dellwood, Ida, and Alma form a family (\\"better than any Morman family\\" and briefly to include a traveling troop of \\"authentic Negro\\" minstrels) that tests them all in ways they could never have imagined. As John Donne said of Chaucer's \\"Canterbury Tales\\": \\"here is God's plenty.\\" With \\"The Man Who Fell in Love with the Moon,\\" Spanbauer has earned a special place in American letters. I can think of no book since \\"Moby Dick\\" that offers such a vivid mosaic of American life, and no book so profound in its understanding of the human condition. This one goes beyond cult; it's a classic for all time.	2003-09-06
US	51986899	RW0GMKIIBLPIO	0060975520	736967873	Faraway Places	Books	5	1	1	N	N	A minor masterpiece	\\"Faraway Places\\" is an excellent introduction to the novels of Tom Spanbauer, author of \\"The Man Who Fell in Love with the Moon\\" and \\"City of Shy Hunters,\\" the first of which is a bonafide classic and the second a grand failure.  \\"Faraway Places\\" is a much shorter work than either of these, and its economy of style may surprise fans of Spanbauer's later books.  However, there is a treasure-trove of riches crammed into its 124 pages, not the least of which is the poetic quality of its prose.  \\"Faraway\\" is the coming-of-age story of Jacob Joseph Weber, a thirteen-year old who, once he witnesses a murder, finds out that the world is a much different place from the one his father has imagined for him, on their lonely Idaho farm.  It is a story of violence and betrayal, but it is also the story of forbidden passion and the possibility of something beyond the mundane reality of day-to-day existence.  It is also the story of incredible loss: \\"I would have liked to have slept and dreamed dreams with Geronimo.  But he was already too far away.\\"  This is a novel rife with metaphor and symbolism that rewards rereading.  You may understand Jacob, or Haji Baba, as he renames himself, better once you've read Spanbauer's other two novels, but \\"Faraway Places\\" stands on its own as a brilliant indictment of a time (the 1950s) and a place (the American Heartland) and of a self-serving philosophy that, ultimately, is built on a lie. \\"Everything is an illusion,\\" Mr. Energy tells Jacob, in the course of an eventful trip to the Blackfoot State Fair.  But it's the reality that cuts to the quick of Jacob's heart.	2003-08-21

After all, this is the Brit who gave us \\"Waterland\\" and \\"Last Orders,\\" a writer has been compared to Dickens and Faulkner.  That is not to say that there are not some good things about \\"Light of Day,\\" his latest novel.  The jokes may be a bit heavy-handed (a murderess is \\"dressed to kill\\"), but there is a residue of Swift's deadpan sense of humor.  His hero is a divorced detective who has taken up cooking and who can't seem to help bedding his female clients, and then assimilating them into his life.  As in his earlier, and far superior work, \\"Shuttlecock,\\" the story is a mystery that doesn't get solved-it's not the who that's important, but the why.  As in \\"The Sweet-Shop Owner\\" and \\"Waterland,\\" a leading character is a woman whose behavior is indecipherable, particularly to the man who loves her, George Webb (great name for a private eye, by the way), the answers to whose questions must await his loved one's re-emergence from prison into \\"the light of day.\\"  But the elements don't add up to much here.  The text is more like notes toward a novel, rather than the real thing itself.  I wanted to know more about these people, not in the sense of learning their motivation, which is understandably opaque, especially in the case of something as outr&eacute; as murder, but at least to the extent of seeing George in action with the object of his affection, Susan, on at least one occasion where he wasn't tongue-tied.  This novel took Swift seven years to write.  He has had bad patches before; between the marvels of \\"Waterland\\" and \\"Last Orders\\" came the disappointing \\"Out of This World\\" and \\"Ever After.\\"  But those were much more ambitious and therefore forgivable failures than \\"Light of Day,\\" which, while continuing to explore Swift's favorite theme of qualified hope for the future, is tentative at best.	2003-07-15

Like \\"The New Confessions,\\" which focused on the movie industry, this term-of-the-century novel takes its hero, an ecrivain manqu&eacute;, from his childhood in Uruguay, to his young boyhood at a British public school, through a number of ill-fated (and deadly boring) love affairs, to his interment as a spy in Switzerland (!) during World War II, to a teaching stint in Nigeria, and his unfortunate flirtation with the Baader-Meinhof gang.  There's considerable scope here for comedy of the type Boyd excels in, but little is made of the opportunity.  Logan Mountstuart is basically a whiner, a man born into privilege who blows every chance he has (and they are many) to succeed.  He writes a couple of popularly well-received novels (one is deemed by critics a \\"nastily unpleasant little shocker\\") early in his career then fails to produce for the next forty to fifty years.  I liked Logan best as a Stalky-like schoolboy, replete with a small cabal of geek friends, who learns he doesn't know as much as he thinks he does, about girls and football, among other things, and as an old gent living in London, who discovers that dog food, while it may not be gourmet fare, can be a suitable substitute in times of need.  The story ends in France, where Logan makes one last, quixotic gesture in the name of love, and falls once again on his face.  If you're looking for a superior examination of the writer's craft, try Anthony Burgess' monumental \\"Earthly Powers,\\" or Penelope Lively's brilliant cameo, \\"Moon Tiger.\\"  There is much to like about \\"Any Human Heart,\\" including some exquisite descriptive prose, and I certainly recommend it, especially to fans of Boyd, but if you're waiting for another work of comic genius like \\"Stars and Bars\\" or \\"A Good Man in Africa,\\" be patient.  We all know Boyd has it in him.Good Man in Africa,\\" be patient.  We all know Boyd has it in him.	2003-07-05

The photos are illuminating, and the text is authoritative.  Everybody knows the story of Bosie and Wilde, and most are aware that Lord Alfred was the offspring of the litigious aristocrat who gave boxing its Marquis of Queensbury rules.  That these two daffy nobs should have combined to bring down one of the brightest bulbs in the Empire is one of literatures great tragedies.  If I have a complaint about the text, it is simply that Murray appears to have convinced himself that Bosie was a great poet and sonneteer, whereas he was actually nothing of the sort.  His poetry is, typically, labored and often syntactically suspect.  He had a few inspired moments during his association with Wilde, and these resulted in the production of a handful of modestly successful works, including his most famous, Two Loves, with the line about the love that dare not speak its name.  Otherwise, Bosie dropped out of the limelight in the wake of Wildes death, only to surface occasionally throughout the first half of the 20th Century, when his name was attached to various court actions for libel, culminating in his being sentenced to jail for six months in the 20s.  It all makes for a fascinating study in self-flagellation.  Douglas may have been a footnote character, but sometimes the footnotes are needed to illuminate the primary text.  In this case, it is his relationship to Wilde that guarantees his footnote status and which, for better or worse, defined his life for the forty-five years he survived his better half.	2003-06-17

The editors have simply strung together an alphabetized listing of many (but not all) films touching on gay and lesbian themes.  But, if you're wondering where to start in this specialized area, \\"Bent Lens\\" provides some pointers.  A few caveats: the indices are limited to names of directors and genres (what about the stars?), there is no indication of what is and what is not available on video, and there are some factual errors (James LeGros is NOT the psycopathic killer in \\"Blood and Concrete,\\" for instance), but Daniel and Jackson have provided a valuable service here, and I'm especially grateful for the wealth of information on the many foreign films--from Hong Kong to Reykjavik--that so rarely reach these shores.

Of course, at this writing, \\"Vanishing Africa\\" is more than two decades old, but I had never even heard of it until I chanced to watch a documentary entitled \\"The Wonderful, Horrible Life of Leni Riefenstahl\\" on Sundance.  The film contains many a revelation about its fascinating subject, but none so remarkable as Riefenstahl's reincarnation, in the 1950s, as a nature photographer.  Banned, for all practical purposes, from making films, she turned her visual sense to advantage by traveling to the Sudan, where she spent twenty years photographing the Nubians and other endangered African peoples.  The images that result are every bit as striking and provocative as anything in \\"Triumph of the Will\\" or \\"Olympia.\\" Of equal interest is the introduction that Riefenstahl has provided for the book; her adventures in Africa were not confined to those behind the camera!  Fortunately, I am lucky enough to have a friend who possesses this rare and expensive book; I now want very badly to see the underwater film that Riefenstahl, who took up scuba diving in her 70s, completed last year, the same year she marked her centenary.	2003-04-08

Adair further speculates on the novel's position as the top gay classic of all time.  I especially liked Adair's observation that another Visconti masterpiece, the woefully neglected \\"Conversation Piece,\\" represents an updating of the Mann story to post-World War II Italy, with Burt Lancaster in the Aschenbach/Visconti role and Helmut Berger as Tadzio/himself.  Readers will note that Adair's own \\"Love and Death\\" is yet another updating of the same tale.  Taken ounce for ounce, a very substantial read.	2002-05-07

There is a wild west quality to both \\"The Heart is Deceitful Above All Things\\" and \\"Sarah,\\" both apparently set in the Appalachia of the last decade, that places them on the outskirts of time.  Cel phones and beepers, the staples of pimps and prostitutes, are nowhere in evidence, and would seem anachronistic if they were.  The novels might just as easily have been set in the 1970s as in the 1990s.  Having said that, Leroy's fictive world of horny CB'ers and the lot lizards who love them (for a price) is perfectly believable, even if it never, in fact, existed, and \\"Sarah,\\" the novel under consideration, is a near-masterpiece of its type.  Part Hugh Selby, part \\"Huckleberry Finn,\\" and part \\"Prscilla, Queen of the Desert,\\" \\"Sarah\\" nonetheless manages to defy categorization.  Its most obvious parallel is to Patrick McCabe's \\"Breakfast on Pluto,\\" which was criminally neglected in America; McCabe's novel tells the story of \\"Pussy,\\" an Irish teenager who sets out to reinvent himself as his mother and comes up with an amalgam of Dusty Springfield's beehived stage persona and Scott Walker's \\"Big Louise.\\"  Set against a backdrop of politics and violence in 1970s Britain, it is perhaps a more complex novel than \\"Sarah,\\" but a worthy companion to it.  Of the two works by Leroy, \\"The Heart is Deceitful Above All Things\\" tells the more affecting story, while \\"Sarah\\" is the more perfect construct.  There is an almost Tom Sawyer (or is it Nancy Drew?)-like quality to Cherry Vanilla's cumpulsion to dress up in his mother's leather skirts and lipstick and to best her at her own game: prostitution.  As a truck parking-lot lizard, Cherry leaves the maternal arms of one pimp to become the saint of another, who is deceived as to C. V.'s gender and who ends up exhibiting him as the reincarnation of Abraham's wife, Sarah, at a truckstop sideshow reminiscent of something out of Flannery O'Connor or, perhaps more appropriately, Charles Portis--Sarah, of course, being the narrator's mother's real name.  If, as has been rumored, Gun Van Sant has optioned the screen rights to the film, he should have a field day casting the gallery of grotesques who populate the novel.  In the space of a mere 166 pages (Picador edition), we are introduced to Pooh, who has second sight and who can see through the narrator's disguise; Le Loup, her pimp, who is confused by his tender regard for \\"Sarah\\"; and Laymon, who keeps pictures on his walls of little girls in frilly underwear and who is shocked to find what Sarah is hiding beneath hers.  Once his masquerade is discovered, and our hero is farmed out to a low-life named Stacey as a kind of second-string, male lot lizard by Le Loup, the action shifts to a truckstop version of an old-west stagecoach rescue, with transvestites and pimps... \\"Sarah\\" is a terrrific entertainment, a one-of-a-kind adventure, that prepares the reader for the more gut-wrenching reality of \\"The Heart is Deceitful Above All Things.\\"  There are moments in \\"Sarah\\" that anticipate the pathos of \\"Heart,\\" as when the narrator explains his attraction to prostitution: \\"I hold those moments--the tobacco and grease-stained hand lovingly caressing my throat, the lips parted in silent ecstasy, kissing my forehead like a parent placing a good-night kiss--I replay them in slow motion as if they took place with the prolonged consumed movements of someone running under water.\\"  That's writing--nay, poetry--of a tall order, and only one of many reasons to read this...first novel.es Portis--Sarah, of course, being the narrator's mother's real name.

True or not, the stories that comprise J. T. Leroy's &quot;The Heart is Deceitful Above All Things&quot; are convincing enough to lead even the most reluctant reader into accepting them as a legitimate vision of family and abuse in America.  All the usual suspects are here--the teenage mother with the substance abuse problem, who has turned to prostitution and is barely more than a child herself; the string of redneck boyfriends, who drive trucks or live in trailers, and who are just as capable of raping little boys as making love to Baby Doll girls; and the hell-fire and brimstone spouting preacher, who is the scourge of God when it comes to disciplining defenseless children and who may be more than just a grandfather to poor young Jeremiah, the Bible-named narrator of the stories and presumed autobiographical stand-in for Leroy--but Leroy keeps them fresh.  His writing is spare and convincingly adolescent, all the while it is clearly guided by an assured hand.  The only problem is that, for this reader at least, the pace is so relentlessly downbeat that, in spite of welcome flashes of humor, I was exhausted three-fourths of the way into the book and found the last two stories before &quot;Natoma Street&quot; to be overkill.  The climax of the novel (for it is so much more a novel than a collection of stories) occurs in &quot;Coal,&quot; in which we learn something of the horrors of Sarah's upbringing and can even forgive her, up to point, for the horrors she has in turn inflicted upon her son. I haven't read Leroy's &quot;Sarah,&quot; which I understand is to be made into a movie.  But it will now be as hard not to read that book as it would be for me to avert my eyes from a train wreck.  Paul Golding's &quot;The Abomination&quot; and Patrick McCabe's &quot;Breakfast on Pluto&quot; treat similar themes and are worthy reads in their own right, but &quot;The Heart is Deceitful Above All Things&quot; comes closer to approximating what hell must be like for an abused child.

The question of how a man like Blunt, or, in his present incarnation, Victor Maskell, could betray his country is a sticky one, but here the answer seems to be, quite casually.  Maskell never appears to be very comfortable in the role of socialist, except when he's put on the defensive by his mocking friends, but he is amused by the idea of spying, which dovetails nicely with his personal philosophy of stoicism, as in Seneca, the Roman philosopher who ended his own life after being implicated in a conspiracy against the emperor, Nero.  The obvious foreshadowing here is driven home by Maskell's obsession with a picture by Poussin depicting Seneca's suicide, which turns out to be possibly as fake as Maskell himself.  Irish by birth, a father and husband, soldier and scholar, Maskell is also a closet homosexual, as well as a distant relation of the Queen.  He is a mass of contradictions, who, having been betrayed as a spy and diagnosed as dying from cancer, has begun to wonder what was real and what illusory about his paradoxical life.  In the end, he must face up to the ultimate betrayal.  In &quot;The Untouchable,&quot; Banville offers a perceptive glimpse into the world of those among us who are obliged to lead a double life, sometimes by choice, as in the case of spies, and sometimes not, as in the case of homosexuals.  In the final analysis, spy and queer are not that far apart: the glamor and tawdriness, the mystery and banality, and always the backward look over one's shoulder. Victor Maskell may not be the most likeable of protagonists, but he is one of the most complex.	2001-07-14

When familiar faces from the earlier book appear in &quot;Glue,&quot; they are treated with suspicion or outright disdain.  Mark Renton, the hero of &quot;Trainspotting,&quot; is known to Gally, Terry, Billy, and Carl, the heroes of &quot;Glue,&quot; simply as the boy who betrayed his mates.  The idea is an interesting one, and Welsh makes sure that we come to know his heroes well.  But this time the ideas, and even the language, seem less fresh.  As in &quot;Trainspotting,&quot; the bulk of the novel, which is set primarily in Edinburgh, is written in Scottish dialect, and Welsh is a master of this form.  But, after having painstakingly developed his thesis in the first two-thirds of the book, he mostly abandons the vernacular language for a rather flat Brit English prose in the final third.  Even worse, subplots that are brought in to flesh out the narrative don't really mesh, especially the one involving an unconvincing friendship that develops between the priapic Juice Terry and an aging American pop star.  Nevertheless, &quot;Glue&quot; offers a handful of genuine laughs, and some memorable characterizations, as in the above-mentioned Juice Terry and his aging &quot;alter ego&quot; Post Alec.  But there is no one in the novel quite as engaging as Renton, the Sick Boy, Spud, or Begbie.  If you haven't already read &quot;Trainspotting,&quot; do so first.  And by all means, see the film.  Then you may be eager for whatever narrative crumbs Welsh has to offer in &quot;Glue.&quot;.&quot;	2001-06-23

As in his previous novels, the prose here is flawless.  No one can paint a dream landscape quite as effectively as Ishiguro (Shanghai in the late 1930s is a fit counterpoint to the chaos of the narrator's mind), while at the same time peopling it with sympathetic, if disturbed, characters.  One clue to understanding Christopher, the central charcter and first-person narrator of the book, is to think of him as an extension of his childhood reading, which would have included generous helpings of detective novels and thrillers, along with classics such as 'Great Expectations,' the name of whose hero, Pip, may have suggested Christopher's nickname, Puffin.  There is certainly a Dickensian irony in the supposed resolution to the story, which has Christopher the unwitting recepient of a villainous benefactor's largesse.  The best way to approach the book may be as Christopher's desperate attempt to make sense out of the tragedy of his childhood by casting himself as the Great Detective (a figure who does not exist outside of books) and his uncle (who was ultimately guilty of loving Puffin's mother from a not-too-discreet distance) as the arch-villain and architect of his unhappiness.  The result is a difficult, but rewarding novel that blurs the lines between fantasy and fiction while exploring the question of obligation, both to family and to those we chose to love.	2001-05-18

As in her earlier, supreior novel, &quot;Restoration,&quot; she treats her readers to a behind-the-scenes look at the private lives of the nobility, as told from the perspective of fictionalized factotums who are but pawns in the hands of their betters.  The narrative focus shifts back and forth among a large cast of characters, which includes King Christian of Denmark and his Royal Consort, Kirsten Munk, but the heart of the novel is really an English lutenist, Peter Claire, who falls in love with one of Kirsten's women-in-waiting, the emotionally fragile Emilia, and in whose  features the King senses the angelic presence of a childhood friend.  There are palace plots and intrigues to unravel, such as that of Kirsten's own mother to replace her in the king's affections with a serving wench, and skeletons in the royal closet, chief among which is Christian's mistreatment of the very friend, Bror Brorson, of whom Peter is a reminder, in an act of perfidy that continues to haunt him into old age.  But the story is best when it focuses on the fates of lesser mortals, such as Peter and Emilia, whose happiness is imperiled by the piques and passions  of their royal employers, although the king's coming to terms with the memory of Bror makes for a satisfying story arc that gives the novel closure.  The historical backdrop to &quot;Music and Silence&quot; is much less flamboyant, and therefore less compelling, than it was in &quot;Restoration,&quot; which drew upon the plague and the fire of London, but its quieter story is no less engrossing, and no less instructive of the period it embodies.  All in all, a good read.	2001-05-01

Some of the brightest names in contemporary Britlit (and a few from this side of the pond) are included, with editor Nick Hornby furnishing, not only a fine story, but also the book's foreward.  (Never, by the way, has a list of Acknowledgments, which drops the names of Emma Thompson and H. K. Rowling, among others, had a finer pedigree than the one that proceeds Hornby's introduction.)  It turns out the book was published in a good cause, that of autism, so you can feel good about yourself at the same time you enjoy the assortment of stories in this volume.  And they are, for the most part, marvelous.  Each reader will have his own favorites, but mine include Hornby's defense of modern art in \\"Nipple Jesus,\\" Irvine Welsh's homophobe's version of hell in \\"Catholic Guilt (You Know You Love It),\\" and, perhaps best of all, American Dave Egger's dog's eye view of life in \\"After I Was Thrown in the River and Before I Drowned.\\"  As someone else has already noted, the stories are mostly short, and, as I can personally attest, they make for great reading on a plane.  Nothing highbrow or overly angst-ridden here--despite the title--just good fun.	2001-04-06

Paul Golding is a master wordsmith with an uncanny ear for dialogue and a gift for characterization.  That the novel, ultimately, fails to cohere, is due to Golding's miscalculation in assembling it in two parts.  Part one, which is set in contemporary London and includes a devastatingly exact portrait of gay club life, introduces the reader to its first-person narrator, for the time being unnamed, who is toying with the idea of a tryst with Dave, the slightly older male prostitute whose personal ad he finds in a men's contact magazine: &quot;Big Uncut Man.  Handsome, lean, muscular, mature, trustworthy.&quot;  The outcome of that affair is left &quot;hanging&quot; as the narrative shifts to Santiago's (our hero's name is Santiago Moore Zamora) privileged childhood on an unidentified Spanish island, as the son of a British ex-public school boy and his ravishingly beautiful Spanish wife.  All of the right Freudian strings are plucked, and there is even an ex-nanny that the child has become fixated on, but there is little in his life, graced as it is by wealth and social standing, that makes &quot;Iago,&quot; as his mother calls him, particularly sympathetic.  In fact, he seems to be a bit of a whiner.  When his father-the villain in the piece--packs Iago off to his former Catholic boarding school in England, Santiago Zamora becomes James Moore, and it is in this guise that he has long-term affairs, first with a young teacher named Wolfe, who tells the linguistically challenged James that he is a &quot;bisection,&quot; and then with his music teacher, Mr. Fox.  There is little sense of exploitation here, as James, even at age nine, is essentially the controller in both affairs.  But there is an implication that James' parents, who are admittedly shallow and materialistic, are somehow the authors of their son's turpitude.  Perhaps it is his eagerness to seek refuge from the taunts of his fellow students-they call him &quot;woman&quot;--with such weak and unremarkable men that leads to James' self-loathing in the frame story, but the connection is not made clear.  However, there are some wonderfully realized set-pieces that more than compensate for the novel's structural weakness, including the story of James' only friendship at school (with a boy named Cross, who later betrays him) and the description of his last appearance (one he describes in terms of humiliation, rather than triumph) among his classmates, in flapper drag, before he leaves to attend Oxford.  James presents himself to the reader in all candor as a self-pitying ingrate and a snob, with his icy mother as his primary role model, but he is not without a sense of self-worth.  And that's what makes his infatuation with Dave, a mere phone number from the back of a magazine, whom he must pay money to be with, all the more puzzling.  Does he honestly hope for love from such an impersonal source?  The fifteen years between James' graduation from public school and his encounter with Dave are only hinted at.  Golding asks a lot if he intends his readers to fill in the gap themselves.  Writers as diverse as Orwell and Robert Graves have written unflinchingly of the English public school system, with its honor codes and institutionalized homosexuality; Golding's novel falls in that tradition.  I only wish he had spent less time at school and more in the bars, where his story breaks fresher ground.authors of their son's turpitude.

The novel opens, appropriately enough, at Oxford, where, in the shadow of their former classmates and professors, the friends have gathered some 25 years later for a Ball.  The narrative follows the movements of the group in a Mozartian roundelay, as each is, in turn, humiliated by revenants that appear to mock the potential they have, with one notable exception, so ingloriously squandered.  The title refers to a pact the graduates once made to underwrite a philosophical treatise to be written by David Crimond, the most charismatic of their set; to the consternation of each, however, it now appears that the book might actually become a reality, and the prospect of its publication leads the group to an orgy of self-reproach and soul searching.  The event of the Ball also inspires one wife to leave her husband and to take up with Crimond, a decision that leads to unexpected complications in all their lives.  The novel is full of comic and tragic moments whenever the principals, whom Murdoch likens to a chorus-line of snails, attempt to emerge from their shells.  A second generation of thirty-somethings is headed down the same path of dalliance as their elders, or so it seems, until, in the final pages, Murdoch offer an affirmation, of sorts, in the form of a pending marriage.  Readers familiar with earlier novels by the late Dame will not be disappointed by this weighty offering from 1987, which can only enhance Murdoch's already-secure reputation as one of the great novelists of her generation.	2001-02-23
US	51986899	RTCRKSJ03D41V	006092909X	123693579	Already Dead: A California Gothic	Books	4	17	18	N	N	Shades of Ken Kesey	Having read and enjoyed Denis Johnson's collection of loosely connected short stories, &quot;Jesus' Son,&quot; I was excited to find a remaindered copy of his novel, &quot;Already Dead&quot; at the bookstore.  I had pegged Johnson as a minimalist on the basis of &quot;Jesus' Son,&quot; a relatively quick read, but this more recent offering ran to over 430 pages.  It took some hundred pages to get a handle on the plot, but once the expository smoke had cleared and I had acclimated myself to Johnson's cast of quirky characters, the book began to take hold of my imagination.  The story involves a young man, Nelson Fairchild, the scion of a wealthy North California family, who makes a pact with the &quot;devil&quot; (in the form of a suicidal but otherwise underdrawn phantom named Carl Van Ness) to kill his wife, Winona, who stands between him and his inheritance.  Other characters, including John Navarro, a police officer transplanted from the killing fields of L.A. to bucolic coastal Northern California, and Clarence Meadows, Fairchild's partner in a marijauna farm, weave in and out of the narrative haze, but with limited impact on the reader.  The conclusion is less than satisfying, but I remain impressed by Johnson himself.  As a stylist he demonstrates an uncanny grasp of contemporary idiom, which includes a killer vocabulary (he added both &quot;jactitation&quot; and &quot;trigetour&quot; to my humble lexicon).  &quot;Already Dead&quot; appears to owe something to another author whose locus is the American West Coast, Ken Kesey, in the epic sense of &quot;Sometimes a Great Notion&quot; and in the surreal, stream-of-consciousness of both that novel and &quot;One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.&quot;  Kesey's muse burned out early; I hope that Johnson will continue to develop as an artist, next time in the service of a more powerful story.	2001-01-21

As in Hollinghurst's earlier work, &quot;The Spell&quot; is peopled with fully-fleshed characters whom we recognize from our own experience, but, this time out, they are given precious little to do.  The plot, such as it is, concerns the matching and mismatching of four homosexual men, ranging in age from 22 to 49, with the youngest, Danny, being the biological son of the eldest, Robin, who is an architect that specializes in renovation.  The novel is written from the omniscient point of view, with shy, doting Alex, the former lover of Justin (who now lives with Robin) and soon-to-be lover of Danny, providing the main narrative focus.  Much of the action is set at Robin's country home, which is located in Hardy's Dorset, a backwater where minds are emphatically closed on the subject of homosexuality but which nonetheless provides the Arcadian backdrop for courtship and romance.  Hollinghurst is working from an interesting palette--his principals pretty much run the gamut of gay &quot;types&quot;--but, for all his wit and erudition (Alex at one point finds himself in a dirty book store &quot;amid the alien porn&quot;--his characters and their amours fail to add up to anything more.  Whereas &quot;The Swimming Pool Library&quot; explored the end of an era in British gay life, &quot;The Spell&quot; seems too worshipful of clubbing and of the drug culture to be instructive on either of those subjects.  Read &quot;The Spell&quot; for its insights into the gay psyche, but don't expect any subtext.	2001-01-03

By comparison, &quot;Spiderweb&quot; may seem a bit insubstantial (it runs to a scant 218 pages), but in the event, it makes its brief quite handily.  Lively's premise seems to be that there are two types of people in the world, those who crave human contact, and those who don't.  Stella Brentwood, Lively's protagonist, is emphatically a member of the latter.  Having retired at age 65 from a career in anthropology, Stella does the unthinkable and &quot;settles down&quot; in a small West England village, where her attempts at domesticity include adopting a &quot;spaniel-type&quot; dog, which she names Bracken, in a sort of afterthought, as well as inheriting the affections of her late best friend's husband, Richard.  But when her dysfunctional neighbors' sons shoot Bracken, in a senseless act of brutality, and both Richard and her friend Judith, who is on the rebound from a Lesbian relationship, attempt to intrude on Stella's hermitage, she disentangles herself from the soap opera of West Country life, and her &quot;character detached&quot; cottage is once again for sale.  In spare, economic prose, Lively brings her characters and the West Country to life.  At one point in the novel, Stella muses that her career in anthropology reduces to a sort of intellectual parasitism.  The novel reader is an intellectual parasite who should delight in this reflection on retirement, incipient old age, and the spiderweb of human relationships.	2000-12-03

But I'm beginning to see its limitations as well. Somebody, perhahps Maltin himself, needs to come out with a companion volume that treats the vast library of TV movies that rarely get any play on the networks anymore but which hold fond memories for me (few are represented in the present volume, and previous entries for TV movies are missing). As it is, there are over 20,000 titles here, and, while I don't always agree with Maltin's ratings, I always appreciate his critical acumen. One quibble: every year since he began indexing \\"stars\\" in the back (I miss the director's index, by the way) I've been expecting him to add the name of Keanu Reeves. It's a curious omission. I can tell from the reviews of his films that Maltin generally likes Reeves, so this doesn't appear to be a deliberate slight. Edward Norton is there, and so is Matt Damon. Why not Reeves?

It is, rather, the story of William, a voice-over artist in London who has a monogamous relationship with Terry, an airline employee, and who enjoys tea-parties and socializing, but, who, in consequence of a medical crisis, has been reduced to sizing up his friends and neighbors as potential organ donors.  It is kidney disease that is slowly overtaking his life, dictating that he may not even sleep in the arms of his lover of fourteen years and that he must transfer his amatory fantasies onto an American porn star, Peter Hunter, who may himself be dying of a degenerative disease.  When we learn that William is in an AIDS ward, not because he has AIDS, but because he has just had a kidney transplant operation that appears to have gone badly, the narrative takes on the quality of a confession.  Williams remembers the petty moments in his life with Terry, as when he used to humiliate him in grocery stores by parodying Terry's mother, who &quot;listened&quot; to the syrup levels in tins of fruit before buying them.  Some of that pettiness threatens to follow William to the grave, as when he sends out a musical dedication to Terry over the hospital radio but misspells his lover's name as &quot;Terri&quot; on the request form to avoid embarrassment.  But it is William's authentic narrative voice--the voice of everyman--rendered in masterful stream-of-consciousness form, that will continue to haunt the reader look after he has put down the book.  Neither a stereotype nor an aberration, William is a man who lives and loves and who wants to continue doing both, just like the rest of us, even though he has been randomly picked out for extermination by a disease.  In &quot;The Waters of Thirst,&quot; Mars-Jones has written a novel that portrays a homosexual protagonist as everyman.

Matthew Kneale's &quot;English Passengers&quot; is the best novel I've read all year and the best historical fiction since &quot;The Sot-Weed  Factor.&quot;  Comedy and tragedy mix comfortably in this tale of a hapless  Vicar's irrational belief that the Biblical Garden of Eden was located in  Tasmania.  His obsession brings together an uproarious mix of Englishmen,  Manxmen, and Aborigines, as Vicar Wilson's voyage of discovery turns into  an indictment of empire and racism.  The novel offers a rich tapestry of  plot and character, with the Manx sea captain, Illian Quillian Kewley, a  true original, as its emotional center.  It is Kewley's humanity that keeps  the book--as well as the Sincerity, his ship--on course, even when events  turn tragic, as in the genocide of Tasmania's aboriginal population.

Hackball (read McCabe) is a master of the shaggy dog  story.  His narratives may evoke the spirits of Mary Shelley, E. A. Poe,  Nathaniel Hawthorne, and even James Hogg, but they do so for no apparent  purpose other than to frustrate the reader's expectations.  Take the last,  and longest of these tales, &quot;The Forbidden Love of Noreen  Tiernan.&quot;  When Noreen takes off for London to become a nurse at St.  Bart's, she is seduced into a, gulp, lesbian lifestyle, replete with razor  blades and leather.  When her lover, mother, and priest, in company with  Eustace De Vere-Bingham, &quot;the effing Protestant,&quot; journey to  London in hopes of returning the lass to Barntrosna, each is, like Noreen,  seduced by his or her baser nature.  Noreen's mother, for instance, belts a  sister superior at St. Bart's who dares to impugn Noreen's character, and  Fr Luke sets himself up as a kind of enabler/saint to drug addicts.  Even  those who find their way back to Barntrosna are haunted by their London  experience.  As always in a McCabe book, the joy here is in the author's  masterful use of language.  His periphrastic syntax and excessive use of  exclamation points should be familiar to readers of &quot;The Butcher  Boy&quot; and &quot;Breakfast on Pluto.&quot;  But &quot;Mondo  Desperado&quot; never quite rises to their level of brilliance.  It lacks  the emotional center provided by a Francie Brady or a Pussy Braden.  However, it will do quite nicely for a laugh or two while we await the  appearance of McCabe's next major work.

And while I don't propose to reveal the manner in  which Morse takes his final bow, I will say that he does so conclusively.  This time out, Morse and his steadfast but less gifted parnter, Sergeant  Lewis, must solve a murder that is already a year old, and one in which  their superior at the Thames Valley Police, Chief Superintendent Strange,  has taken a personal interest.  Oddly, Morse too appears to have had ties  to the victim, a middle-aged nurse who attended him during his last  hospital stay.  Could this explain his reluctance to join in the chase?  Meanwhile, Lewis must tread lightly as discrepancies in the evidence seem  to point to a cover-up that may well reach to the top of the police  hierarchy.  But the case soon takes an Oresteian turn when the most likely  suspects turn out to be members of the deceased's own family, and Morse  must sort through a mystifying web of alibis and motives to arrive at the  shabby truth.  As usual, the main interest in the novel is in watching the  Great Man ply his trade.  An avid crossword puzzler, Morse often seems to  be purposely obscurantist, especially to Lewis, who, like the reader, is  generally a quantum of steps behind him in the process of ratiocination.  If there's a lapse here, it is in the author's failure to adequately flesh  out the character of the victim, whose bloodlessness renders her an  unlikely target of murder, let alone of Morse's amours.  But this will be a  minor quibble for Dexter's fans.  When Lewis collapses in tears at novel's  end, he expresses the inconsolable grief of all who have followed Morse's  careeer from its inception to its remorseful end.	2000-05-01

A character in a Graham Swift novel complains that England is degenerating into a &quot;high-class&quot; Disneyland.  In &quot;England, England,&quot; Julian Barnes takes that none-too-original idea as the germ for his satire  on modern-day Blighty.  The problem is that a novel idea does not always  add up to a great novel.  I was actually reminded more of H. G. Wells'  &quot;Tono-Bungay&quot; than of anything by Swift when I read this novel,  and the potential is there for a pointed satire on &quot;Cool&quot;  Britannia.  However, the satire in &quot;England, England&quot; never  really develops.  I had the feeling, when I got to the end, that the middle  third of the novel was missing.  I am a great fan of Julian Barnes and have  never before felt that any of his novels were underwritten.  This time,  however, I was left wanting more.  Sir Jack Pitman, the book's most  interesting character, is caught in flagrante about halfway into the book  and practically disappears from its pages, leaving Barnes to focus on the  near-colorless Martha Cochrane, who, as the little girl that grew beans  competitively and worked jigsaw-puzzle maps of Britain, is meant to  represent the salt of her native earth. Unfortunately for Barnes' readers,  she lacks piquancy altogether.  There are lots of laughs along the way,  including a set piece involving a latter-day Dr. Johnson, who takes his  role as the Great Cham in Sir Jack's theme park to heart and develops a  commercially unhealthy fatalism, but the whole of &quot;England,  England&quot; is much less than the sum of its parts.	1999-08-04
