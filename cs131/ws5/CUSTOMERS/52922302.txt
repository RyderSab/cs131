Ditzy Stephanie is suppose to be out of the bounty hunter business...off the streets and working for Ranger.   She's still torn between Ranger and Morelli, still having her cars blown up, running around with Lulu and Grandma, and eating donuts.  It is the same same...not as many laughs as some of the others...but a good summer read anyway.	2005-07-10

This time the book was worth the read.  It is easy reading material, fast paced, keeps you guessing and page turning till the end.   Nothing heavy in this book, just a fun who-dun'it.	2005-06-24

While this book is not as funny as previous novels - it is entertaining. A fast read with a few giggles.   This bounty hunter series is &quot;comedy&quot; - NOT suspense.   It is Stefanie's typical bounty hunter lunacy.  Why are all these readers suddenly taking Stefanie Plum seriously???? <br />Yes, the potoato chip felon is dumb.  Books One through Nine also had much dumb, not realistic, tales.  Remember when she fell out of the tree in the backyard of the mob?  And all the funeral home stories?<BR>come on everyone..........lighten up.<br />Again, it isn't the best of the series but it will keep you entertained for a few hours.   <br />If you are new to this serious...don't start with this one.  Hot Six...possibly the funniest....will make you laugh laugh laugh.	2004-07-11

After reading it, and it was a struggle to read, I can only say I am glad I didn't pay hardcover prices to read one of my favorite authors.  Ms. Evanovich has let me down.<br />The book obviously didn't make the bestsellers list years ago - but now - the author is marketing it again....why, probably because she has a following who buys her books.  <br />Well, if the next book isn't any better than this.............I'll probably decide to read a few chapters in the bookstore before investing the money (hardcover OR paperback).	2002-11-09

She is quite clever, amazingly funny and knows how to incorporate the element of intrigue to keep the pages turning.<br />This is not a serious mystery story - so if you aren't into comedy...don't waste your time here.   This is not a book for anyone that takes life too seriously. <br />Now if you are wanting a fun read.... check it out.  Hot Six is a clever comedic story that includes a half-baked mystery plot, a wacky but relate-able romance, with some skrewball characters.  The story moves at such a quick pace that you won't want to put the book down. (Unless of course your sense of humor is a bit too serious, then forget it).  <br />Stephanie Plum will make you laugh - REALLY laugh - so if you are reading in public - be prepared for those around you to notice you are reading this book.	2002-07-04

Chapter 1 kept my interest, Chapter 2 I started to lose interest, and by Chapter 5 - I was wondering if it was ever going to get better.  It didn't.   I read it...but was disappointed.<br />First of all, this female character isn't very intelligent.   The main male charater is totally unrealistic.  No Fortune 500 CEO would waste the time of day doing what this guy did...... It was totally unbelievable.  It was suppose to poke fun...but I just didn't get it and thus didn't find any of it amusing at all.  Oh yea, except for Chapter 1.............  I probably won't read any more Jane Heller's.	2001-09-08

This book just doesn't have the same suspense.  The charachters are dull, story line isn't very exciting, and there is no intrique.  It is an easy read but I predicted the 'who done it' pretty soon into the story line.  Bottom line, I wasn't very interested in the who killed the young gay hooker story line and why.....no intrique....not a page turner.	2001-09-08

It use to be that I would read Sheldon's novels in one day.... fast paced, filled with intrique, twists and turns, characters that made you either love them or hate them or question them.... and when I was finished reading I was not only fulfilled but anxious for Sheldon's next novel.<br />Those were the days....<br />Now, I still can read his novels in one day, but....   this book (as many of his books in the past 7 years) are just not fulfilling.  The character development is lacking, the story has no intrique and when I finished, I wondered one more time...why do I still buy his books.   (The answer is because I remember those that I really loved, like Master of the Game, Rage of Angels, Windmills of the Gods,  and I keep hoping he'll have another one that reaches the same heights of enjoyment.)<br />After this book,  I'll read more Amazon reviews before I rush out to purchase the book on its first day of sale.  The book is just not worth it...   if you are a fan of Sheldon...wait for the paperpack.<br />If you have never read him before....buy any of the books I mentioned and you will truly enjoy his writing ability.	2000-10-14

HOWEVER, if you want a fun, fast-paced, entertaining novel - read Stuart's books.    I  enjoyed this, my husband enjoyed this, and my sister and brother-in-law  enjoyed this book.  Good 'lay on the beach or by the pool' novel.   While  some readers don't like like reading about restaurants, fine wine - I,  quite frankly, enjoy this touch that Stuart adds to the characters  escapades.    Serious readers should lighten up....or go buy War and  Peace...

Cooking such beautiful and delicious  food doesn't get more easy than this!  It is sure to impress.<br />Suggestion  to the authors,  next time add a few helpful hints along the way.  The  soft-shell crab batter was a little watery to really create the crisp  batter.   Adding ingredients slowly (club soda) with the instruction on the  correct consistency would have been helpful.<br />By the way,  leave it out on  the coffee table.
