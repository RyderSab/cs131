It's not bad enough that the poor girl lives in the Twin Cities where winters are downright hostile.  In addition to this, she just turned 30, just lost her job, and just got run over by a Pontiac Aztec.  Much to her surprise, she wakes up a few days later in the morgue.  Much to her disgust, she wakes up dressed in pink wearing cheap PayLess shoes!  Eouw.  Betsy knows immediately that the Evil Stepmother has struck again.  And it may be the last time, too, because the reborn undead Betsy isn't taking any crap from her stepmother or anyone else for that matter, including vampire kings who want to destroy her.  Can she help it if she was reborn an undead Queen of the Night?  She finds it a hassle, but other vamps will simply have to deal with it.  Betsy's best friend Jessica has no problem at all accepting that Betsy is now a vampire.  In fact, Jessica thinks it's very cool and has plans for Betsy to become an avenging angel of the night.  But first Betsy has to deal with the evil and ugly Nostro and the drop-dead gorgeous Eric Sinclair (her romantic antagonist).<br /><br />Join Betsy on her wisecracking romp through the night as she kicks the you-know-what out of would-be rapists and muggers and does battle with Nostro and his fiends.  Ladies with a shoe fetish will especially appreciate Betsy for her undying desire to possess endless pairs of Ferragamos, Manolos, and Jimmy Choos.  If you find Betsy's smarty-pants remarks annoying, take heart that you can polish this one off in a day and you'll probably have a lot of fun doing so.  I give Undead & Unwed a solid 3.5 stars.	2005-09-20
US	49484986	R2S95TIWL4TVCW	0316011770	454028739	The Historian	Books	2	21	25	N	N	"My dear and unfortunate [reader]"	Elizabeth Kostova pulled a fast one on Little, Brown and the Hopwood committee.  Apparently, LB had high hopes for this book, and judging from the book's position on the New York Times Bestseller List, their hopes were not in vain.  Unfortunately, for those of us hoping for an absorbing summer read, our hope, it seems, is in vain.<br /><br />The Historian purports to be The Historical Dracula, giving us the history of Vlad Tepes, aka Vlad the Impaler from Romania.  Ms. Kostova has written perhaps the book she would like to read while learning about central and eastern European history, because if you are a Europhile, you will probably enjoy this traipse all over the continent with the 3 main characters in 3 different time eras; yes, that's right.  While this approach can be effective, it isn't in this case, because the characters do not have distinctive voices. All they seem to do is run all over the place looking for someone or something, and nothing ever comes of it.  No sooner do they meet the person they were looking for do they find out there is yet ANOTHER person they have to track down to find another miniscule piece of the never-ending puzzle.<br /><br />So what are they looking for?  The teenage girl we meet in the beginning of the story is trying to unravel the mystery of the ancient journal she found in her father's library.  The book is blank save for a dragon in the center with the word Drakulya over it.  Apparently, this mystery chooses its own and her father was also one of the chosen.  Second, we have her father (Paul), back before he was a father, trying to find his missing graduate school professor and friend, Bartholomew Rossi, also one of the chosen.  Finally, Paul in current time has taken off to find the girl's mother, who the girl does not remember.  The book spends the majority of its time with Paul before he became a father, in central and Eastern Europe, trying to find Rossi.  There he encounters a number of mysterious other \\"chosen\\" individuals; how they all meet at one time or another is completely implausible, until you consider the power of Vlad over unsuspecting humans.  The dark and mysterious Helen, a fairly developed character, is a direct descendent of Vlad and she has already been bitten on the neck by a brutal librarian, no doubt one of Vlad's watchers or keepers or whatever they call themselves.<br /><br />Will Helen \\"turn\\"?  Has Rossi succumbed to Dracula?  Will they find Dracula's tomb?  I sure hope so, because after 642 pages I'm going to be very upset if something doesn't happen in this long-winded novel.  It took Kostova ten years to write this one.

Alice Hoffman's latest novel, The Ice Queen, is a great read for any season.  Having just finished it, I hope to see it on the bestseller lists this summer, because Hoffman has done an excellent job.  She has woven together the gothic, the ordinary, the spectacular, and the scientific to create a story that has depth and magic, meaning and entertainment.<br /><br />Our unnamed narrator learned a long time ago that she had the power to bring death by a single wish.  Like so many of the fairy tales that she loved as a child, life was illogical and dangerous and the wrong word uttered would bring a world of pain upon whomever she spoke of, whether she wanted it or not.  She learned this on a cold icy January night, the eve of her mother's 30th birthday.  Mom is going out to enjoy her birthday with friends, but her daughter stamps her foot and says, \\"I wish I never see you again!\\" all in childish selfishness, because she wants her mom to stay home with her.  Her wish comes true.  She makes a decision right then never to make another wish, to keep quiet.  Love is a dangerous thing; it's better not to feel much of anything at all.  She becomes The Ice Queen.<br /><br />Until she is struck by lightning and it changes her life forever, in the here and the now and in the ever after, two timelines that Hoffman's story is very much concerned with.<br /><br />Those who love the dark gothic death wish and fairy tales of the Brothers Grimm variety will find much kinship with this story (our heroine grows up to be a librarian but her secret passion is finding out about all the ways to die).  And what child hasn't felt responsible for something that really was not his or her fault, and carried guilt over things they did not control?  This story speaks to a very human part of all of us-the common belief that as children, we are responsible for the world around us.<br /><br />It takes something as dramatic as a lightning strike to change her life, and Hoffman shows this in the novel by melding the mysterious power of myth and fable, scientific fact for the meteorologist in you, and the slow, minute process of personal change and growth.<br /><br />There is so much in this novel, whether simply as a surface read or as a multi-layered story.  Hoffman is a master craftsman.  The story is told in a little over 200 pages (I read the book in about 12 hours), but there is much to linger over and ponder here, and don't be surprised if the story hits home in a very personal way.  In The Ice Queen, Hoffman has achieved the great task of fiction: to lie her way to the truth.  She tells many truths here of the human heart, how we are wounded, and how we can heal.<br /><br />I strongly recommend The Ice Queen for summer reading, or any season for that matter.

The story covers their friendship from its fragile beginnings at the Iowa Writers Workshop in 1985 until December 2002 when Lucy Grealy died at the age of 39 in New York City.<br /><br />Patchett's narrative is engaging and the inclusion of so many of Lucy's letters to Patchett raises the level of writing to poetic at times.  This is a book that I read every spare moment I had: at work during lunch, after work in the evenings, before bed, and on the weekend.  While Lucy's escapades got tiring near the last 30 pages of the book, the writing flowed enough that it was not a chore to finish the book at all, to reach the inevitable conclusion.<br /><br />Patchett loved and adored Lucy.  We see her going to almost any lengths to be a friend to Lucy.  While Lucy was clearly the belle of every ball (and their were many, many balls), she was nowhere near the friend to Ann that Ann was to her, and Ann was more than willing to accept the situation as it was. Apparently, lots of people were willing to accept Lucy as she was if only to bask in her glow.  Just from reading the book, I cannot for the life of me understand what was so magnetic about Lucy Grealy.  In terms of the four temperaments, Lucy was a classic sanguine: talkative, fun loving, always having to be the center of attention, and never taking life too serious as long as she was having a good time.  Ann seemed to be more of the phlegmatic type: relaxed, calm, and compliant, the one who maintained the daily routine of living.  Ann described herself as the industrious ant while Lucy was the grasshopper, boisterous and consuming.  Ann was perhaps way too complaint with Lucy, and while some reviewers think that Ann's indulgences of Lucy's misbehavior contributed to Lucy's demise, I disagree.  Lucy was on self-destruct for a very long time, and it would not have mattered what Ann or anyone else did.<br /><br />Because Lucy was an addict.  Her behavior, even before her narcotics abuse, was textbook-addict: manipulative, promiscuous, self-centered, selfish, and self-pitying.  It seemed Lucy's axis of values had been reversed-the things that one often values as important meant very little to Lucy, but she obsessively focused on the insignificant to the point of psychosis.<br /><br />It's easy to say that Lucy was set up to die the way she did from a young age; the debilitating jaw cancer, chemotherapy, and the many operations she endured during her lifetime may all have contributed to her eventual drug addiction.  But every addict has an introduction to drugs, whether it's surgeries, an older sibling or their own curiosity.  More than her history and even more than narcotics, it was arrogance and stubbornness that killed Lucy.  She was introduced to drug rehab and recovery programs a few times, but in the end it made no difference.<br /><br />Ann's memoir of her relationship with Lucy is a great read.  I hope that someday Ann will find a friend who can return her level of friendship.  While the book focuses so much on Lucy, Ann was that rare friend who loved without condition.  But not even that love could save Lucy Grealy.ree.

Desperate people in desperate situations.  Pain and jaded glibness.  A solid handle on the hard-boiled crime fiction style.  This is the short list of what you'll find in Richard Aleas's first offering in the Hard Case Crime series, a series he helped create and is currently the editor of.<br /><br />The last time John Blake saw Miranda Sugarman, they were comfy cozy in bed together, talking about their plans after high school graduation.  Ten years later, John sees Miranda's face in the paper under the headline \\"Stripped Found Murdered.\\"  When Blake takes it upon himself to find out what happened to his good girl, his partner tells him \\"you won't like what you find.\\" But Blake takes the case on anyway, out a sense of obligation to his high school flame.  Blakes' boss was right: the Miranda he knew in high school is a far cry from the Miranda who ended up dead on the rooftop of a New York strip joint.  Little Girl Lost tells us how she got there.<br /><br />It's been awhile since I read any James Cain, but film noir is fresh enough in my mind to know that Aleas hits all the high points of the genre.  It's told in current time using current technology but it's still crime noir, which reveals what we already suspected: technology changes, but human nature doesn't.<br /><br />Ride along with John Blake and his associates (the good, the bad, and especially the ugly).  He's faced with a moral dilemma near the end of the story, and he could go either way.  But I won't spill it.  You'll have to find out for yourself.<br /><br />Little Girl Lost is a solid 4-star read.	2005-03-23

A lunatic of any race is still just as crazy.  Greta Hicks is a psycho first and biracial second, so she isn't the stereotypical tragic mulatto.  We wish she would quietly drink herself into oblivion and leave other folks alone, but no.  This is the story of a psychotic's do-over, but this time she has a hostage.<br /><br />The narrator is a recent college grad from Berkeley, California, her home town.  She's moved to New York as the recipient of a prestigious journalism internship.  When we first meet her (we never learn her name), she's living in an old women's boarding house but soon to move in with her boyfriend Andrew.  One night at a party of Andrew's friends from Andover, our narrator is privy to the racist banter that can go on when people don't realize they're in mixed company.  And she is mixed, racially mixed, that is, and light-skinned and straight-haired enough to pass for white.  She sees a side of Andrew that she'd perhaps secretly feared was there, and when she does, she decides to leave him.  Now all she has to do is find a place to live in Manhattan where she knows no one and has no connections.  Enter Greta Hicks, a coworker, who knows of a sublet that's available.<br /><br />We see a young woman who's bright enough to be a journalism fellowship winner but who's unsure of herself.  It's this insecurity that allows Greta to get her hooks into the narrator.  What begins as payment of gratitude evolves into an uneasy and somewhat forced friendship and spirals down from there.<br /><br />Senna has a strong sense of the stark bleakness of New York in winter, the nothing sky and the bite of cold.  I felt the storyteller's desperation when she says \\"what do you have to do to find a place to live in this town?\\"and I felt her despair when she finally finds a place to live (thanks to Greta) and how abysmal it turns out to be.<br /><br />There are no ironic twists in this tale leading to great revelation or wisdom.  No doubt, many readers will see what's coming.  Symptomatic is a portrait of a modern woman gone insane, poisoned by her own bitterness and despair to the point of madness.  If you've ever been stalked, if you're biracial, or if you have a nostalgic longing for New York in winter, you will be \\"all in\\" with Symptomatic.  If you're not, it's no great loss.

Turns out that reading 52 books in 52 weeks isn't Ms. Nelson's only endeavor.  She really does work for a living.<br /><br />Which gives hope to the hopelessly addicted bookaholic who has to work full time but still dreams of reading everything under the sun.  Nelson confesses in the first sentence of her book that she's an insomniac and spends many late hours in her library with her closest friends, her books.  In So Many Books, So Little Time, she gives us an overview of how her project to read 52 books in 52 weeks turned out and what it's like to be a lifelong biblioholic.<br /><br />Unlike those born with book sickness, Nelson came to her \\"disease\\" late in life.  She didn't develop full-blown bookaholism until her college years, when friends and dollars were few and she discovered that with a library card she could be transported to any time and place in the entire world simply by reading.  That's when she discovered that reading was more than a \\"path to good grades.\\"<br /><br />So you'd think that she'd go on expounding wonderfully about the authors and books she loves, and giving no quarter to books she didn't love.  Unfortunately, I quickly learned why this book was filed in the Biography section of a major bookseller's store when I went looking for it soon after it was published.  Nelson spends more time talking about herself and her immediate family than she does the books she read.  At first, I was drawn in.  Then I was annoyed.  Eventually, I got over it and tried to simply focus on what she was saying about her reading.  But ultimately, her chatty style was disappointing for me.  Clearly, she's quite pleased with herself and her life, which is fine, but not what I was looking for.  I would prefer Virginia Woolf's The Common Reader.  But that's not fair.  Nelson is a columnist with the New York Post, not one of the greatest writers of the twentieth century.  Still, I would have preferred more book talk that didn't have Ms. Nelson, her son, or her husband at the center of it.<br /><br />What I did enjoy about So Many Books was the reality check, one book nut to another: the \\"double-booking,\\" because not all books are appropriate for all the places one can read.  The superficial way of judging others based on what they read.  The feeling of loss that comes at the end of a very good read, the sense that you haven't finished a book; you've lost a good friend.  Nelson goes one better than friends; she sees her books as lovers.  She talks about being torn over \\"to re-read or not to re-read?\\" and the surprises sometimes in store when we do.  And she talks about \\"reading's ability to beam you up to a different world.\\"<br /><br />The short, bite-size chapters make this a quick read, so if the book is annoying, it won't last long and you can get back to more serious reading.  I wouldn't go out of my way to read this book; for excellence in this genre of books about books, read Virginia Woolf's The Common Reader.k Post, not one of the greatest writers of the twentieth century.

But when Chantelle comes home to find her father on the floor, stricken with a heart attack, she prays to God for her father's life and promises Him that if He'll let her daddy live, she'll start \\"livin right.\\"  Next thing she knows, her father is revived and Chantelle sets out to keep her promise to God.<br /><br />The next 200+ pages cover six months in the life of Chantelle as she revisits old family wounds, cleans house in relationships she's been in for too long, and reevaluates who she is and what she wants out of life.<br /><br />Sweet Bye Bye is geared to twenty something females who are going through this time in their lives, and Christian women in this age group will find this book particularly entertaining.  It's definitely Christian chick lit, because a focus on God and trying to live life according to God's principles is what separates this book from typical chick lit novels.<br /><br />But Chantelle is no Sunday school teacher.  She wrestles with her flesh, her ambitions in the workplace, materialism, and all the struggles that abound in the post-modern world.  She's no goody two shoes; she's just another sister trying to live right and find that balance between living in the world and living God's way.<br /><br />You can polish this book off in a day or a weekend of concerted reading.  For what the book is-Christian chick lit-it definitely delivers.  It also has a fairy tale ending and the dialogue is sometimes a bit wooden and unrealistic, but once again the story is good for what it is.  I recommend this book for the young Christian woman struggling to live in the world with Godly integrity and without compromise.	2004-12-13

It's not half bad for the rest of us, either.  Not a great read, but certainly better than the current god-awful pulp from Dan Brown.  I wouldn't lump them together, but the work of both authors shares the themes of lost treasure and ancient secrets.  Grossman is an infinitely better writer than Brown; Grossman's a real writer.  As book critic for Time magazine, Grossman has clearly done his homework and it shows.<br /><br />In Codex, we meet Edward Wozny, a 25-year old investment banker in NYC, on the eve of his departure for a new banking job in London.  Edward is a wiz kid at investment banking but it comes too easily to him, and Edward doesn't know who he is or what he wants.  Edward just goes with the flow.  He can work like a dog so he does, and it pays well.<br /><br />When Edward is offered the opportunity to do a bit of book sleuthing, he's somewhat intrigued once he gets past his pride.  Don't these people know who he is?  \\"Dammit, Jim, I'm a banker, not a librarian!\\"  But it's his 2-week vacation between jobs and he doesn't have a clue what to do with himself anyway, so why not?  Suddenly as aimless as most other twentysomethings, he takes the bait.<br /><br />What follows is a cohesive story of chase, intrigue, romance and computer obsession.  Edward's computer geek buddy Zech turns Edward onto MOMUS, a terribly realistic computer game that seems to parallel Edward's search for the lost codex.  Eventually, Edward can't even remember what it was like to be a yuppified workaholic in lower Manhattan.  Between MOMUS, searching for the codex, and sleeping in, Edward practically becomes a slacker, dedicated to nothing but his current obsessive interests.<br /><br />Grossman can write and he's well read, no doubt about it.  But he's crowding too much into one book.  MOMUS could be another story altogether, and it doesn't come up in Codex often enough or integrally enough to be a good fit.  Once Edward hooks up with bookish female protagonist Margaret Napier, the story takes greater shape and the hunt for the lost codex is on in earnest.  Still, MOMUS doesn't quite fit.<br /><br />The motives of the codex benefactors remain a mystery, and it's my guess that they want the codex found because it will reveal that these supposedly rich-beyond-measure eccentrics are actually flat broke!

What makes Slater's book a standout, though, is that it's the experience of one of the first people to use Prozac for depression. Slater writes her diary ten years after she first started taking the drug regularly in 1988, so we get to read of the long-term affects of daily dosing and how the drug changed her life over time.  What was most interesting about Slater's story is how she had to learn to live life as a no-longer-depressed person.  Her entire life, depression and its consequences dominated her life, gave her life meaning and routine, and defined who she was.  When the \\"Zac\\" started working, she struggled to develop a new sense of herself, separate and apart from the depressed Lauren.<br />For me, the problem was that there wasn't enough experience there; something felt missing from the story. Perhaps it was the editor's fault. Or maybe my expectations were incorrect from the start.  Slater's history is briefly given: lifelong struggles with depression and other forms of mental illness, a history of hospitalizations and attempts at various therapies, none of which were successful until Prozac in 1988.  Perhaps I wanted to know more or I wanted the story to be told in a different style. I can't put my finger on it, but for this reader there was just something missing.  Slater's writing style is poetic, but it was sometimes a distraction.<br />I highly recommend the book to those interested in antidepressants for any reason, whether it's history of Prozac's rise to prominence (what some call the aspirin of our age), how it affects people over the short and long-term, or simple voyeurism into the mind and life of someone classified as mentally ill.  Lauren Slater truly benefited from this drug, and while many people think Prozac is tossed around too freely these days, she is an excellent example of whom this drug was originally developed for.  It's staggering and sad to think how many lives could have been saved if we'd had this drug fifty years ago.<br />Prozac Diary is a slim read that can be devoured in one day by the voracious reader.

US	49484986	RX6IRJSO88NWH	0671027360	141370518	Angels & Demons	Books	2	6	8	N	N	Absurd and Long-winded	Angels &amp; Demons is the absurd plot-driven prequel to Dan Brown's Da Vinci Code. The Vatican and the Illuminati are the two main characters of the tale.  Everyone else is peripheral. This is one of several sins that make the novel so bad-- there is no character development at all.  Michael Langdon is a one-dimensional Indiana Jones type (it's obvious author Dan Brown has celluloid ambitions) who's awakened at the crack of dawn and whisked off to Europe to become a major player in a centuries-old grudge match between the Illuminati and the Vatican.  But what the story is really about is what happens when one man tries to make himself God and rectify what he sees as unforgivable sin, with a disastrous outcome of course.<br />But you won't discover that until the last 50 pages of the book.  In the meantime, you'll get a primer on the Illuminati and be dragged all over and under Vatican City with Langdon and the ever-slender Vittoria as they try to prevent the murders of 4 cardinals and find the antimatter canister before it blows the Vatican and half of Rome to bits.<br />Brown has packed this pulp with tidbits about long-dead religions and cultures, medieval scientists, and Renaissance artists.  If you're interested in these topics, you could have a blast chasing down Brown's facts.  Or you could accept it all at face value and go along for the ride.<br />And what a ridiculous ride it is.  If you think the first 500 pages of the novel are completely absurd, wait until the last 50 pages.  It would appear that Brown has a gift for intricate plotting, and Behold! It all neatly wraps up in the end!  Or did he write an outline first and fill in the blanks to flesh out the (ahem) story?  That's my guess, and it's unfortunate because the story may have taken an intriguing turn if there were any character development beyond Langdon's 9 lives and ever-present Harris Tweed jacket, and Vittoria Vetra, the intelligent, mysterious, slender damsel in distress.  Of course Langdon gets the girl (after they've saved the world) with all the cute corniness of a James Bond movie.  The book is replete with Brown's pontifications on religion, Christianity, and the church's long history of suppressing scientists and scientific truth to protect the church's power.  Brown's bias is clear throughout the book, and this didactic pummeling reveals a weakness in his storytelling abilities.<br />The success of Da Vinci Code proves that one needn't be a decent writer to capture market share. You may enjoy Angels &amp; Demons, but I thought the book was silly and long-winded.  He could have cut the book by 200 pages for my taste.  It wouldn't have improved the writing, but at least it would have ended sooner.gdon gets the girl (after they've saved the world) with all the cute corniness of a James Bond movie.

This book was in the Staff Picks section of the bookstore and I'm so glad I plunked down the hardcover price.  The entertaining and often touching tales of Bob's life with a seemingly endless number of animals brought lots of smiles to my face and even had me afraid to read this book in public.  You never know when you're going to bust out laughing with this one, but I'd estimate that once on every page is a fairly good guess.  If you've ever toyed with the idea of starting your own Noah's Ark, here's your reality slam. Don't get that third, fifth, or tenth pet without reading this book first!<br />It started innocently enough with a bunny named Binky. Being a bunny slave to two angelic/demonic lagomorphs myself, I found it perfectly fitting that his story should start with a bunny rabbit. Rabbits hypnotize their owners into believing that they must acquire more rabbits, and where it stops no one can say.  There are animal tales aplenty here with a strong emphasis on the avian variety.  Parrots, ducks, turkeys, geese, starlings, you name it.  If birds are your fancy, you definitely don't want to miss this read.<br />Individuals who struggle with depression will also find a kindred spirit here, as Bob openly shares his experiences with depression and how the daily routine of caring for all his animals affected him for the better.<br />Every side of being a devoted pet owner is represented here, including the sadness and grief when a special pet dies or when pets suddenly abandon their posh digs for the call of the wild. The upbeat and hilarious commands the lion's share of the book, though, and many passages are to be read more than once as you marvel at the intelligence and antics of Bob and Linda's critters.<br />Contribute to the care and feeding of the Tarte Bunch now by picking up this book Today.  Don't wait for the paperback. If you're a pet owner, you know vets and feed don't come cheap.<br />Thanks, Bob, for sharing your brood with us.

Just read the jacket on her collection of short stories, Drinking Coffee Elsewhere.  The girl has already garnered more awards, prizes, and accolades than a lot of writers do in their entire careers.<br />And her writing shows why.  As an African American woman, I have to say it's wonderful to finally read fiction by another black woman that covers territory besides the worn-out male/female relationship.  Black or white, chick lit is pretty formulaic stuff that grows old very fast.<br />But ZZ (if I may) covers vast territory in her stories.  Childhood friendships; betrayal; racial conflict and the individual (and how friendship overcomes); international travel and finding yourself not only somewhere else, but someone else; black church life and the deceit that often accompanies it (white churches are no different, BTW).  This girl's language and dialog are authentic, and nothing is superfluous in her stories.  She uses irony with great skill and paints pictures that place the reader squarely in front of the action.  We see hope, compassion, humility, loss, and triumph  here.  And it's all written into captivating stories about people and situations we've known or been a part of.<br />Here's hoping Ms. Packer doesn't lose interest in writing. I can't wait to read her first novel.  I just hope she doesn't lower herself to chick lit.  That would be a colossal waste of her talents. But somehow, I don't think she'll have to scrape the bottom of any literary barrels for a very long time to come.  Keep your eye on this girl.  ZZ Packer is the one to watch.	2003-11-12

Practical and straightforward, two attributes to be expected from a dancer.  Dancers wrestle daily with the obstinacies of the flesh.  It's not about smoke and mirrors.  It's about hard work and commitment, the \\"habit\\" of showing up to do the work and developing one's creativity in the process.<br />2. Literary and literate.  Tharp quotes the Bible, Dostoyevsky, Mozart, and many other greats of the Western Canon to illustrate her points and show that the struggle to be creative is nothing new and that great artists have fought the same battles as anyone who strives to create.<br />3. Accessible. There's no mystery or theory of genius here other than the habit of work.  Tharp constantly makes the point that we have to establish habits for our creative pursuits or the work will not get done and the creativity will have no place to manifest.<br />4. Myth Busting. Mozart didn't get his musical genius from On High; in fact, he worked his fingers into early deformity from practicing so much.  Not that Tharp proposes hurting oneself in the creative quest.  She's merely making the point that practice is supreme, not sitting around waiting for the muse to make an appearance.  Her choice of Mozart is historical, but I've heard similar about Michael Jordan.  When other ball players were out doing whatever, Jordan was on the court practicing his shots.<br />5. Encouraging.  One of America's greatest choreographers shares her demons with us, so we know our fears aren't \\"special,\\" and no, they won't go away with success, so stop with the \\"if only.\\" Wrestling demons is just part of the process; it comes with the territory.<br />I love the layout of this book: an airy, elegant use of color, font, and white space, which parallels the visual of her stage work.  Tharp is very generous in sharing details of her work regimen and her methods for getting things done.  Obviously it works for her.  The good news is that because her methods are so practical, they can work for others, too.<br />Tharp uses photos very sparingly in this book, so if you're looking for a photo history of her career or her company, this isn't the book.  She focuses on the Creative Habit and she doesn't make herself or her work the center of the story; she draws on the experience and history of many well-known artistic giants and a few lesser known artists as well.<br />If you want to create or you're interested in the creative process, don't wait for the paperback.  I've seen many books on creativity, but this is by far the most practical and accessible one I've read.  Tharp knows that it takes hard work and good habits to create something tangible, and she doesn't waste our precious time on mystical mumbo jumbo or some magical &quot;way&quot; of the artist.  It's the work, folks.so practical, they can work for others, too.<br />Tharp uses photos very sparingly in this book, so if you're looking for a photo history of her career or her company, this isn't the book.

US	49484986	R77FSMZ7KTX6Y	0316666343	784206304	The Lovely Bones	Books	3	5	5	N	N	Ultimately Unsatisfying	Alice Sebold's The Lovely Bones has been on the New York Times Bestseller List in hardcover for close to 2 years.  I wanted to see what the big deal was.  Having finished the book, I still don't know what the book's mass appeal is about.<br />Don't get me wrong: Sebold knows how to turn a well-crafted sentence. She's brilliant here and there.  And she has a good grasp of capturing and showing painful human emotions and the slow, sorry slide into oblivion that a family often makes after a tragedy like the rape and murder of Susie Salmon, the story's narrator.  But for this reader, the book was ultimately unsatisfying. The cord running throughout the entire book, in my mind at least, was \\"how are they going to figure out who killed Susie, and when?\\" That's why I kept reading.  I kept waiting for it to happen.<br />But I had no closure.  Near the end (warning: spoiler), Susie breaks through to the other side and what does she do?  Years after her death, what does Susie want?  Does she seize a rare opportunity to tell who killed her, where her body is buried, and where the killer is?  She could; Susie is the standard omniscient narrator.  But she doesn't.  She uses her One Big Chance to get laid by her first almost-love. Oddly, that event gives some closure, as if to say it's okay that the killer got away if the victim is &quot;over it.&quot; But for me, the ending was a disappointment. There was no justice, no meaningful irony.  There was irony, but it was too neat, almost trite, I'd say.<br />The daily news is filled with stories of women and children who are brutally murdered by perpetrators who are never found. I understand Alice Sebold was a rape victim herself and told her story in her first book, \\"Lucky,\\" said to be so named because the police told her she was \\"lucky\\" to be alive, because another woman had been raped and murdered in the exact place where she was attacked. Alice knows the real deal because she's lived through it.  But I was hoping, right up until the end, that the cops (who get so close) were going to catch Susie's murderer. Who knows? Maybe Alice was telling the story of the woman who was killed where she was raped. Maybe he got away, too.<br />I'm glad I read The Lovely Bones, but I felt cheated at the end.  If I died and went to a heaven like Susie's, I'd be one angry ghost.  I'd come back and kill the murderer myself, just for banishing me to such a lackluster eternity. Maybe readers felt better about Susie's death, given the ending of the story.  Not this reader.

Meet Lance Armstrong, the illegitimate son of a single teenage mother in Texas, who became the fastest thing on a racing bike this planet has ever seen.  At the height of his early career, Lance was diagnosed with testicular cancer and beat the disease and the odds to survive, thrive, and prosper, often in the face of naysayers who said, \\"he's finished.\\"<br />I'm not a cancer survivor or a cyclist, so neither of those things drew me to this book.  I wanted to read how a champion, someone who's always been a winner, handles adversity.  I didn't come away with any formula for success; for one thing, Lance says explicitly in the book that he'd seen people with no strong will to live survive cancer while others who were absolutely determined to beat the illness died from cancer.  Looks like it simply wasn't Lance's time to go. Since his recovery, he's helped many other people with cancer and devoted a great deal of his time and resources to those struggling with the illness. He says that once you have cancer, you are forever a member of what he calls &quot;the cancer community.&quot;<br />Lance didn't strike me as someone with a sense of entitlement, a case of \\"that will never happen to me.\\" He was too busy pedaling.  But when he was diagnosed, he wasted no time applying the same tools and tactics to fighting cancer that he applied to racing.  The consistent thread between his illness and his championship bike racing was his approach to both: he's in it to win and he'll do whatever it takes to succeed. This is a man with true commitment, a very rare quality in today's hurry-up-I-want-it-all-right-now culture.<br />This story has a happy ending-he beat the disease, he won the Tour de France, he got the girl, and the happy little family walked off into the sunset.  That's the short version.  But it's no fairy tale.  Lance's story has given hope to many and enjoyment to others. An accessible, conversational tone runs throughout the book, and we get a sense of the Texas boy who grew up riding through the Texas prairie with a very determined will and a good sense of his natural gifts.  Easily polished off in a focused weekend.<br />*It's Not About The Bike* is also a great tribute to single moms and the power of a mother's unconditional love and support.

Not that there's anything wrong with that; I love reading about the writing process.  Yet in the context of a novel, that approach feels a tiny bit like a cheat to me.  In spite of that, once she gets past her anxiety, she finds a story worth telling and that's what drew me in.<br />Iris Greenfeder, the protagonist and narrator, is a writer who by her own confession, never finishes anything.  Instead of Ph.D. at the end of her name, she puts ABD for All But Dissertation.  She got her master's but didn't finish her Ph.D.  Her mother, the now deceased K. R. LaFleur, wrote two books in an unfinished trilogy about a fantasy world called Tirra Glynn.  Iris's mother was quite famous and Iris sees an opportunity to complete her dissertation by writing a memoir of her mother's life.  But first, she must uncover the circumstances of her mother's mysterious death.  She sets out for the Catskills to spend the summer at the grand vacation hotel that has been in her family for many years.  Over the summer, Iris hopes to find the missing manuscript of volume 3 of her mother's unfinished trilogy (egged on by her mother's infamous editor) and solve the mystery of her mother's death.<br />The question of whether a woman must sacrifice her art (and therefore, her self) to have a man in her life is a subtext throughout the story.  It factors into the lives of Iris, her mother, Iris's maternal aunt, and the deceased mother of Phoebe Nix (yes, rhymes with Stevie Nicks), a poet of Sylvia Plath-like fame.  Phoebe is a great character; I picture Parker Posie with a buzz cut.  Phoebe's mother committed suicide at the height of her success. There's a connection between Iris and Phoebe's parents, and that's one of the mysteries of the story.  Phoebe is certain that marriage and motherhood destroyed her artistic mother (her suicide has since been attributed to post-partum depression); Iris wonders if the same is true of her mother, although her mom died in a hotel fire on Coney Island.  The legend of the Selkie is the folktale-metaphor throughout the story, showing what happens when women sacrifice their art and identity to please man.<br />I'm not terribly thrilled with Iris's retelling of the Selkie legend, which is placed at the beginning of each chapter as excerpts from her mother's work.  But there's a heartbreakingly beautiful telling of the Japanese folktale, the Crane Wife on page 64.  A Japanese rendering of the universal \\"wife must sacrifice all for her husband\\" theme, this tragic folktale will leave you in tears.  It's thoughtfully woven in as a homework assignment from one of Iris's students.  My thanks to Carol Goodman for sharing this wonderful folktale with me. If she included the whole Iris-as-writing-instructor part just to share this exquisite little piece with the reader, it was 100% worth it.<br />No sooner does the plot thicken in one area of the story than Goodman adds a new, unpredicted twist to generate greater intrigue and momentum. Not as atmospheric and closely knit as Lake of Dead Languages, but a respectable follow-up.

Four 15-year-olds, all born in September, best friends for life.  Meet the magical, traveling pants that the girls share over their first summer apart, shipping the pants from DC to Greece to Baja California to South Carolina. Together, these five characters are the Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants.<br />Ann Brashares tells an engaging story, as she skillfully weaves the tales of the four girls (plus pants) together.  She's created characters you care about and surely ones that teens will identify with.  The four girls all learn life lessons over the summer:  Tibby learns the value of life from an unlikely friend struggling with leukemia; Carmen learns to accept herself and be honest about her feelings with her soon-to-be remarried Dad; Bridget learns that boys can't fill the hunger in her heart, and Lena finds the courage to love. As for the pants, well, who hasn't owned a perfect pair of blue jeans that fit as though they were made with only you in mind?  That's the magic of these pants: they fit all the girls perfectly and look fabulous.  Any girl knows immediately that these are indeed magic pants.<br />Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants is great for light beach reading or finding out what the young adult market reads.  Brashares has a good thing going:  she's already published the second installment, and with main characters this young and a strong market for chick lit, we could see more from Tibby, Bridget, Lena, and Carmen.  Long live the Sisterhood. And please send the pants to San Diego.  I need them to help me find a job.	2003-05-29

Would you still love her?  Perhaps this is the idea behind Bernard Schlink's 1995 international bestseller The Reader.<br />In The Reader, Schlink presents a story that is only shocking in its attempt at nazi sympathy. A sexual relationship between a willing 15-year old boy and an older woman is not news today or yesterday. What disturbs me is the basic premise of the story.  Are we to feel sympathy for this woman simply because she's illiterate?  Does her ignorance somehow lessen her crime? Does being illiterate explain her inhumanity, her ignorance of evil?  Not guilty by reason of illiteracy?<br />It's easy to believe that Hitler's ranks were filled with illiterates and miscreants. The idea that an illiterate woman kept the delicate, sickly girls from being gassed at Auschwitz to read to her (until she was through with them) isn't far-fetched.  Disgusting, yes.  Surprising, no.  Hanna's illiteracy and her attempts to conceal it make her brutality no less inhumane; if anything, it makes her worse because she's as proud as she is cruel.  She has no remorse about her actions.  But she's prideful enough to hide what she finds shameful-not that she's a cold-blooded killer, but that she can't read.  Outrageous.<br />Schlink's language typifies the German stereotype-stark, austere, harsh.  What's interesting is the philosophical questions he poses and his thought processes as he tries to think his way through a problem to the best conclusion.  But what is \\"best\\" based on, other than man's own system of values?  Isn't that what Hannah obeyed?  In her case, it's generally agreed that those values were of a madman.  When the protagonist wrestles with philosophical issues, he goes to his father, a philosopher by profession.  He comes away with no insights and no answers.  In the end, the story neatly concludes itself, and doesn't answer any moral questions.<br />The Reader is thinly veiled nazi sympathy, and that is ultimately the most shocking thing about Schlink's novel.  Schlink knew his case was indefensible; hence, the brevity of the novel.  If there were some deeper point he was attempting to make, it must have gotten lost in translation.ader is thinly veiled nazi sympathy, and that is ultimately the most shocking thing about Schlink's novel.

If you mourned finishing the Secret History, pick up Goodman's book.  While not as lush as Secret History, the Lake of Dead Languages has enough similarities to its predecessor to feel like a continuation of Tartt's book.<br />Heart Lake School for Girls in the Adirondacks is described as a \\"last resort for a certain kind of girl.\\"  That is, the kind of girl who's bright, troubled, and mostly a bother to her moneyed family.  Intelligent girls who've been kicked out of other boarding schools for the usual offenses (sex, drugs, acting out) are sent to Heart Lake. The school has steadily fallen in rank since its inception in the late 1800s.  Jane Hudson, the story's protagonist, was once a student there when the school was of a higher rank. When Jane separates from her husband and has to fend for herself and her daughter financially, she returns to Heart Lake to teach Latin (the dead language of the title) and regain her footing in life.<br />Heart Lake has a dark legend (some would say curse), and the teenage girls at the school work hard to keep the legend alive.  Problem is, actual events reinforce the legend, if not dictate the certainty of events.  In Jane's quest to get at the truth of the past and the present, two parallel stories unfold.<br />When the past seems to repeat itself at the school, Jane decides to find out exactly what happened all those years ago.  She muddles through the events of her youth at Heart Lake, carefully piecing together memories, family relations, old photos, and old journals to finally learn what happened to her close friends Lucy, Matt, and Deirdre.

The book opens with a hilarious narrative about the main character's nails of all things.<br />It's been years since I read Fabulous Nobodies, but it's a definite stand-out in a genre that didn't exist when the book was published in the early 90s.  If you're in your 20s, a slave to fashion, any or all of the above, you've got to read this book.  You can finish it in a day and you'll spend most of the time laughing at the antics of the main character and her crew. Our 20s are a great time of life (if only in retrospect), because we're no longer teenagers but not quite mature enough to be adults, so there's much goofing off, goofing around, and goofing up to learn from (or at least laugh about).  Fabulous Nobodies is filled with all three.  Don't miss this one.	2003-02-08

Woman (Red Dress Ink)	Books	2	1	1	N	N	Typical 20-Something Chick Lit	25-year-old Sarah moves to L.A. to set up housekeeping for her fiancee's arrival only to be dumped.  This is a common wake-up call for many females, and L.A. Woman is about Sarah's awakening and growth. The book's title is taken from a Doors tune of the same name, and the chapters are similarly named. An interesting choice, considering the Doors is 70s music and the clubbers in the book are all into techno. This incongruity is just one of several in the book.<br />The book took a while to get started; at first, Sarah was doormat to everyone. But things take a turn for the better around page 70 when Sarah finally stands up for herself against her outrageous boss. The doormat character was obviously an  unnatural stretch for author Cathy Yardley, and the story flowed much better after Sarah started to show a little backbone.  There's no shortage of clich&eacute; here, though. None of the characters are terribly original, but Yardley manages to develop them enough to elicit buy-in from the reader.  There's nothing literary here, either.<br />The good news is you can finish the book in one stay-indoors day. If you're in the mood for a very light read, L.A. Woman is as good a bet as any. The story is mildly entertaining, and will no doubt win many cheers from young women who've gone through Sarah's situation.	2002-12-21

Nor did I attend a highfalutin New England Ivy League school.  I didn't understand the occasional lines of Greek, Latin, and French in this book, and I'm not an intellectual snob.  But these small details don't detract from the thoroughly enjoyable experience of reading the Secret History.  If you appreciate a well-written, well-told story that entertains, has good character development, an intriguing story, and reveals more than a little about human nature, you're going to like this book.  As if that weren't enough, there's also a liberal dose of contempt for the rich, and who doesn't enjoy that?!  For those who've studied Greek, Latin, French or the classics, the story will be even more rewarding.<br />Tartt uses Richard, the most accessible character, to tell the story with ease and authenticity.  The six main characters (all in their early twenties) live in their own insular world at a small New England upper crust college, studying the classics with one solitary professor.  There's Henry, the leader and probably the one most likely to succeed as a true scholar; Francis, the skittish hypochondriac; Charles and Camilla, the twins; Bunny, the obnoxious and ill-fated one of the bunch; and Richard, the California kid from the most humble background of all.  At first, Richard can't believe his great luck to fall in with such a gilded clique, but as usual, things are not as they appear.  Soon, the outer world intrudes (they bring this upon themselves, of course) and things fall apart.  It's the telling of the unraveling that grips you as Tartt deftly controls how much to tell and when.  I marveled at her lush descriptions that rival a poet's, her skill at narrative and dialogue, and her most revealing descriptions of human mannerisms and behavior.  She repeatedly builds intrigue and tension all the way to the end of the 500+ pages of the novel.  This is no easy task, but she makes it look effortless. While reading it with an eye on technique, I think, \\"of course that's how it's done.\\"<br />When this book came out 10 years ago, Donna Tartt was reported to have been paid the highest publishing advance ever for a first book, over $400,000.  I don't know if the book is worth that or not, not knowing how worth is calculated in the publishing industry.  Still, having read the Secret History, I can see what all of Tartt's fans have been waiting for these past 10 years, and the Little Friend is now on my list of must-reads.<br />Secret History is \\"definitely cinematic, baby.\\"  Images of The Bad Seed, Village of the Damned, and the Talented Mr. Ripley came to mind early in the story as Tartt developed the characters.  The setting is so clearly drawn in some parts that I suspect Tartt wrote them with an eye on cinematic rendering.  A top Hollywood director currently holds the rights and I'm looking forward to the movie.<br />The Ballantine Books Reader's Circle edition contains \\"A Conversation with Donna Tartt\\" along with \\"Questions and Topics for Discussion\\" for those fortunate enough to read this book in a group setting.  I loved reading Tartt's list of authors she admires.  It's no surprise that her list of poets is even longer.  All of her interests are well represented in the Secret History, and if you share any of these, reading the book will be an even more fulfilling experience.<br />Don't be put off by the setting and character types in this book.  You don't have to be a literary snob to understand or enjoy the story.  It's worth the time to read the book, and if you're an aspiring writer, there is much here to educate and marvel at.

There's much here to satisfy the spiritual palate, but above all, T'ongil is a well-crafted love story about two mysterious people who discover in each other an ancient and other worldly connection.  Spirituality is more than a backdrop here.  It is an inseparable element that makes the main characters, Ainsley and Changmi (Rose), who and what they are.<br />Ainsley (the Tiger Whisperer as his peers know him) meets Changmi in an unlikely place in modern-day times.  Each is deeply familiar to the other, but they aren't sure why.  Both are apprehensive because of past wounds.  Still, they cannot leave one another alone and are inevitably drawn to each other in spite of fears and, in Changmi's case, occupational barriers.  There's something between these two that transcends the present and evokes primal memories of another existence.<br />Winter's skill as a poet shines throughout in his stunning descriptions of the southwestern landscape of America.  Having lived in the southwest for many years, I know his descriptions of land and sky are dead on accurate.  He obviously has experience with the topics his book explores.  Perhaps he's spent time in the Far East or the South Pacific and the American Southwest.  Or he has an understanding of Native American spirituality. One could easily get bogged down trying to cover far too much ground with so many subjects, but Winter holds all of these elements in perfect balance to create an intriguing and very readable debut novel.  T'ongil is a hybrid love story that is fundamentally about the longing for love and the search for one's soul mate.  Ainsley and Changmi have found that love in one another, but how will it culminate?  Finding out is a satisfying read.  Don't miss T'ongil.	2002-10-28

They have all bought into the lie \\"what you have is who you are\\" or my favorite rendering, \\"what you got is who you is.\\" They have all the trappings that we're brainwashed to believe will make us happy, but they all have holes in their souls because they live for nothing greater than glorifying self, a sure path to abysmal disappointment. The women in Little's story appear a little better than the men, but they're still after self-gratification, they merely choose procreation to achieve their ends while the men choose the traditional routes of sex, money, and power. No one seems to have a moral compass; one character in the story chants to himself \\"[think] only good thoughts\\" when he thinks he's on the verge of making partner at the firm, even though he just dumped his wife of 10 years for a model who's incapable of loving anyone other than herself (he just doesn't know it yet). The men are all womanizers (\\"dogs\\" and \\"players\\"). Through processing their failed relationships, the women emerge somewhat healthier for the moment, but the men remain lost and continue chasing their tails (and everyone else's).<br />The Itch made me grateful not to be a part of the MBA buppie world with its insatiable appetite for material consumption and never-ending quest for self-glorification. If your life resembles that of anyone in The Itch, I feel sorry for you.<br />It takes hope to scratch the itch; unfortunately this book does not provide any.	2002-07-09

Alcorn can write! You won't have to sacrifice technique or craft for content when you settle in with one of his books.<br />Ishbane Conspiracy is fun even for those of us who've long since left high school. It's evident someone closer to that age group (his daughters) helped write this book, because the dialogue and terminology is so current and authentic. And the way the story focuses on 4 characters and their relationships with each other draws the reader in and holds their attention, too.<br />How did he come up with those demon names? The part where one demon remarks that someone \\"now has the ghost\\", as in Holy Ghost, cracked me up. Even though it is crystal clear that Alcorn has used this as his soapbox, it's interesting to see how he does it using this technique. While I doubt that demons have such dialogues with each other (but how would I really know?), I got a kick out of seeing Satan's plan for destruction told from the viewpoint of his minions.<br />You can polish this book off in a weekend. I am so proud of Randy's Alcorn's skill as a writer. It's unfortunate that more so-called Christian writers are not as talented as he. Go, Randy!	2002-06-24

Astrology? Humor? Relationships? Vitriol? All of the above, which is what makes it so fun.  Ladies, if you've just been dumped or if you have a sneaking suspicion that the one you're with is a bastard, then this is the book for you.  This absolutely unapologetic volume of man hatred takes the done-to-death astrology motif and applies it to defining a man's most despicable traits with frightening accuracy.  Forget Linda Goodman's Love Signs.  It's the bad stuff that can hurt you, and Lang and Rajah have detailed all of it in brutal honesty and high hilarity.<br />This is the kind of book I want to throw away as soon as I've exorcised the demons that accompany my broken heart (and hurt pride), but that would be a waste, because I'm bound to need it again, even if only for some good old male-bashing fun.  It's a must have for gen Xers, nexters, boomers, and any woman who engages in the dating war.  It's well researched, well written, and well, it's just flat out a lot of fun.<br />Compatibility tests are included to find out which bastard suits you best.  After all, we still can't live with them or without them, bastard status notwithstanding.  Guaranteed to perk up the crestfallen and the downright despondent.	2002-06-14

In the burgeoning genre of chick lit, file Jill Davis's Girls' Poker Night under the sub-group neurotic WASP lit.  The book conjures up a beige and gray landscape; one of the characters is named The Cadaver, and it's perfect casting.  The main character, Ruby Capote, is a journalist who writes a daily column for the New York City News or some other made-up major daily newspaper in NYC.  As flaccid and tedious as the novel is, the author still gives Ruby a bit of a fairy tale life: she shows up to her NYC newspaper job to find a boss who was in love with her before they even met, or so he admits in one revelation.  Michael could have been a great character, but instead he's relegated to minor character status. He could have been as manipulative in his self-disclosures as Ruby is in her well-crafted indifference.<br />Ruby's ultra-uptight, neurotic, noncommittal status is exposed very early when she tells us she's got to break up with her boyfriend because he collects bread ties and has a waterbed with satin sheets.  Even considered in context with Ruby's history, her life is overwhelmingly self-centered and self-indulgent.  Author Jill Davis makes it clear that this story is all about a girl who can't commit, can't take a risk, and can't get it together to actually have a life, but if I knew this girl in real life, I'd slap her, tell her to grow up, get help, and get a life.  Even when she does talk with her therapist, it's all about thwarting the therapist's efforts, because Ruby is a self-saboteur who will not be coaxed into breakthroughs or their subsequent growth.  Why go to therapy at all?  I'd spend the hour and the money shoe-shopping.  But Ruby isn't that colorful.<br />Lines like \\"I don't know, he seems to miss some pretty basic stuff...Like how great I am\\" aren't convincing when she's just told us how afraid and bland and insecure she is.  She says she's great, but ultimately sounds like a character out of Prozac Nation, but without the attitude and drugs thrown in for edge.  She's way too white bread for that. If I had to give Ruby a voice, she would sound like the main character from \\"Daria,\\" the MTV animated series. She wouldn't say the same things, but she would have that monotone voice. Flat and bland.<br />It was hard to get a read on Davis's intentions for the novel.  When Ruby says, \\"A dapper man by nature, he would have worn a tuxedo if he were really trying to kill himself, I believe,\\" is that supposed to be witty?  Funny? Is it black comedy?  To me, Ruby just sounds crass.<br />With all of its self-obsession, neurosis, and unevenness, Girls' Poker Night is funny in parts, but the humor is sparse and the main character's emotional state is too hard to pin down. The book is uneven throughout.  Peripheral characters are undeveloped as well.  I'm not sure why they're there, except perhaps to give the book length.  The girls' weekly poker night is certainly not a gathering I looked forward to in the book; it did nothing to propel the story; all we see is the neurosis of Ruby and her friends.  It's nothing as interesting as Ruby being a killer poker player in juxtaposition to her personal life, capable of strategy and doggedness not found in her relationships, or anything as mundane as Ruby being a cheater.  She [stinks] at relationships AND poker.<br />By the middle of the book, my task was simply to finish reading it.  I finished, and thank God's it's over.  Learn from my experience and don't waste your time on this book.  Instead, wait for the movie to come out.

The idea behind the story is highly imaginative; I love the idea of a world where people are so passionate about literature and philosophical movements that there's a need for a literary detective branch of law enforcement.  Too cool!  I find myself re-reading passages simply to confirm that I read what I *thought* I read.  But then again, I'm not a purveyor of sci fi.  Still, I think the author has done a great job to weave a tale that is so far free of vulgarity, gore, violence, or perversion.<br />I give this book only 3 stars because in spite of its virtues, there's a lack of depth here.  I can't put my finger on it exactly, but I find myself wanting  M O R E  substance to the story.  Not to change the story, but for it to have more depth.  Perhaps more character building, more of an inside view of our girl Thursday.  Also, I wish there was more of an intermingling of the classic tale with the main story.  But perhaps it will develop in the next third of the story.<br />Meanwhile, I look forward to digging into this book.  I'd say it's worth the hardcover price, especially with a discount.	2002-04-24

Real publishers obviously knew this when they read the manuscript for The Other Side of Thirty.  The author is as stubborn as she is opinionated and got this one to market on her own.  Maybe that's admirable, but there's a lot to be said for realizing when you don't have anything original to say.<br />The Other Side of Thirty is one 30-something's opinions on body image, career, hobbies, finances, etc.  In other words, her shopping list of the controllable items in one's life, except of course, finding a man.  She laments wanting to feel wanted in a post-feminist world.  Ani asks, is a woman a true feminist if she needs a man to make her feel complete?  She answers that and a hundred other questions, all unilaterally in \\"the world as i see it\\" journal-style format.  There's not a real story here to distract the reader, no characters with challenging viewpoints, no situations to toss her much-cherished opinions into the crucible of real life.  There's only one email boyfriend whose messages we read, and of course, he doesn't challenge her or say anything the least bit unsupportive.  He is the model boyfriend, asking all the right questions and having all the right responses.<br />Education, career, relationships with friends, hobbies, etc. can be controlled to some extent in our lives.  But when it comes to that most intimate and revealing of relationships, a love bond with the opposite sex, there are many factors we can't control.  That's what bothers Ani, but I don't think she realizes it. She's done everything else right (hasn't she?) and yet at 30+, she still doesn't have a man.<br />Most women will agree with a lot of Ani's remarks and observations.  I found many things I agreed with and have been through, too, but so what?  Sometimes we need to approach old problems with new attitudes to find solutions.  This book offers no new perspective on things.  For the still-single-after-30-woman, there is a phase of reflection most women go through.  Maybe she'll get over it when she hits 40.  Thank God I did.fter-30-woman, there is a phase of reflection most women go through.  Maybe she'll get over it when she hits 40.  Thank God I did.	2002-02-08

I give this book 4 stars for its high fun quotient and its realistic portrayal of addiction--the lying, justification, denial, cut-and-run tactics, the whole bit.  I know!<br />In spite of not particularly liking the main character (I can't stand women whose only priority is how fabulous they look; too shallow for me), I found myself rooting for her when she stood up for herself or finally got honest about something.  Granted, it didn't happen very often.  Perhaps it's a credit to the author to create a character I could emotionally buy into; maybe I'm a sucker.  Either way, I wanted this crazy girl to snap out of it and get herself together.<br />While the laughs in this book aren't as many as in &quot;Bridget,&quot; it's still pretty funny, and several episodes are complete gut-busters.  Buy this book for yourself and all the compulsive shoppers in your life!	2001-12-12

This book is just what the doctor ordered. \\"Bridget\\" is a very quick read; you can polish it off in a day easily and you'll be laughing out loud the entire time. I kept expecting the neighbors to drop by and say \\"What are you doing in there?!\\"<br />Sadly, this book rings true for too many females, regardless of age or nationality. Discontentment with work, men, body image, and family are obviously universal. Misery loves company and \\"Bridget\\" proves it. Nothing lifts the spirits like realizing that you're no more (or less) neurotic than most everyone else. \\"The therapeutic value of a [reality check] is without parallel.\\" Buy this book!	2001-11-27

Alcorn can write! You won't have to sacrifice technique or craft for content when you settle in with one of his books.<br />Ishbane Conspiracy is fun even for those of us who've long since left high school. It's evident someone closer to that age group (his daughters) helped write this book, because the dialogue and terminology is so current and authentic. And the way the story focuses on 4 characters and their relationships with each other draws the reader in and holds their attention, too.<br />How did he come up with those demon names? The part where one demon remarks that someone &quot;now has the ghost&quot;, as in Holy Ghost, cracked me up. Even though it is crystal clear that Alcorn has used this as his soapbox, it's interesting to see how he does it using this technique. While I doubt that demons have such dialogues with each other, I got a kick out of seeing Satan's plan for destruction told from the viewpoint of his minions.<br />You can polish this book off in a weekend. I am so proud of Randy's Alcorn's skill as a writer. It's unfortunate that more so-called Christian writers are not as talented as he.	2001-09-20

So many books about weight loss only attack the outer problem.  But Crystal shows us how, by documenting her own process, to get to the root cause and deal with that.  There's no quick fix here, and Crystal states that up front in the introduction.  If you're not ready to get down and dirty and do the real work of facing compulsive overeating and its causes, this is not the book for you.<br />Crystal shares her story and reactions to situations and events in life that many, many women share, regardless of race.  She reminds me of things I had long forgotten.  Books that bring up the pain have the power to change us.  Crystal encourages us to take a look at that stuff, even when we're thinking &quot;that was 30 years ago.  How can that have anything to do with today?&quot;  It can and it does.  By sharing her journaling techniques and encouraging us to embrace age-old pain, Crystal leads us to see the root cause of our dependence on food and how to get free forever.<br />  Thanks, Crystal, for having the courage to share and help women who are struggling with this problem everywhere.  And thanks for doing it for YOU, not for a man or anyone else.	2001-04-30

I found a lot I could identify with in this book, and it brought up many forgotten incidents and feelings.  For that reason alone, it was worth the purchase price.<br /> Black, White and Jewish is also an interesting commentary on Alice Walker.  Reading Ms. Walker's books, I would think she'd be more attentive to her daughter's emotional needs.  But what I see is another American woman at a loss when it comes to connecting with her daughter.  In many ways, Rebecca's story reads like that of an adult child of divorce.  In contrast to her &quot;different&quot; racial status, she remained simply another American teenager, trying to figure out who she is.<br /> I'd like to read Rebecca's story in 10 years after she's (hopefully) had a chance to grow up.  It seems she hasn't quite figured out who she is yet.	2001-03-29

This book is very good at giving you a quick, intermediate level overview of different problem character types.  Armed with the overview information, you can seek out other resources for more in-depth research.  For example, her chapter on the narcissist was a very good overview and many of the traits overlapped with what was spelled out in Scott Wexler's book on passive aggressive behavior.<br />If you're clueless about your companion, this book is a good place to start looking for answers.	2001-02-28
