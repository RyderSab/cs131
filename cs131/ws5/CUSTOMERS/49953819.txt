In the second wedding the brides' dress gets ripped to shreds and  the gazebo falls on the bride and groom. The third wedding gets even worse  the culprit goes as far as to threaten the bride and turn all the power  off. In the foruth and final wedding the subject gets threwn off a little.  After the culprit is caught and put in jail, the brides' ex-boyfriend  kidnapps the bride and threatens the whole congregation with a bomb.

The other is that Mighty had previously witnessed his  father murder his mother, and very soon his father will be getting out of  jail.<br />This is a really groovy book because it is a &quot;page  turner.&quot;  The author gives such a clear, descriptive image of each  character that you can almost taste their personalities in your mouth.
