They are (as described by theirchapter titles):<BR> 1. Pedophilia in a male with a history of hypothyroidism<BR> 2. Masochistic disposition and rejected sex reassignment in a homosexual male with congenital micropenis<BR> 3. Sadomasochism in a male with congenital micropenis<BR> 4. Autoassassinophilia in a bisexual male with a history of congenital ambiguity of the sex organs<BR> 5. Masochism in a 46,XY female with Androgen-Insensitivity Syndrome<BR> 6. Bondage and Discipline in 45,X/46,XY female with a history of genital ambiguity and early childhood sex reassignment<BR> 7. Bondage and Discipline in a female with congenital vaginal atresia<BR> <BR> There is also a chapter on historical thoughts about causes of paraphilias, and a chapter summarising the concept of lovemaps, specifically relating to paraphilias (from Lovemaps, 1986; and Gay, Straight And In-Between, 1988). This book introduces a seventh Grand Paraphilic Stragagem (Paleodigm) not mentioned in those previous works, called Subrogation and Understudyship (later renamed Protectorship and Rescue). A chapter discusses possible causes of paraphilia, going beyond the Opponent Process Theory mentioned in previous works.<BR> <BR> Perhaps the greatest omission from this book in my view, given the book's specific focus on vandalized lovemaps (specifically paraphilias in this case) is that only two pages are devoted to the two important topics of prevention and treatment. The two pages of this chapter discuss some thoughts on the causes of the paraphilias in the seven biographies (and thus how those paraphilias could have been prevented), and treatment is left to merely mentioning treatment with the drugs MPA and CPA.	2000-04-13

It is currently published by Star Publications of India (and reprinted by western publishers); it is of the fairly low printing quality typical of books from  India.<BR><BR>The 180 page Sinhala-to-English section contains one or more  possible translations for each Sinhala term, or a very short description of  its meaning; most definitions take one or two column lines. The printing is  moderately small and often a bit smudged, so it can be difficult to  distinguish similar-looking Sinhala characters. Each two-column page  contains about 70 terms, for a rough total of 12,600.<BR><BR>The 140-page  English-to-Sinhala section is, interestingly, printed in considerably  smaller letters. Each English term gets an approximation of pronunciation  in Sinhala characters (for Sinhala readers wanting to know about an English  term), followed by a few words of a Sinhala translation, often containing  translations for related terms; eg the headword &quot;pension&quot; also  contains a translation for &quot;pensioner&quot;. Each pages contains about  65 main terms, for a total of about 9,100.<BR><BR>In my limited use, I have  found that the English-to-Sinhala section often doesn't have quite simple  terms, though thinking of synonyms sometimes helps. Interestingly, if you  have an idea of the Sinhala translation and look _that_ up, you often find  that you can find the very same word in the Sinhala-to-English  section.<BR><BR>I like the way this dictionary provides very short  translations/definitions for each term, especially as attempting to read a  Sinhala definition of an English word could otherwise be quite difficult,  when all you want is a list of possible translations. However, it clearly  isn't as comprehensive as a bigger dictionary could be; lacking not only  less common words but also common words too. 336 pages, 15 x 22 x 2.5 cm.	2000-04-07

Frank Baum himself; biographical details, his history of books, the writing of the 14 Oz books, his relations with illustators, and his involvement with stage plays and films based on Oz. This section, like the whole book, is illustrated with many black &amp; white illustrations, b&amp;w photographs, and a few color plates.<BR> <BR> The second chapter describes the ongoing Oz phenomenon taken over by Ruth Plumly Thompson and some later Oz authors, and includes pictures of the dustjackets of some of these books as well as many other illustrations.<BR> <BR> The third chapter deals specifically of course John R.

Here we learn something of Mavin's early life, along with her brother  Mertyn and the Wizard Himaggery, and the plot is set up for the following  two books in the trilogy.<BR>  <BR>  I certainly found this book an  enjoyable read -- more so as a teenager than I do now -- but Tepper's style  has changed a little in this and the other two Mavin books, as compared  with the True Game trilogy. The plot is more straight-forward, lacking the  interconnectedness which gave The True Game good re-reading potential;  having read the book once, there is less to gain from reading it again.	2000-01-21

(I actually have the Corgi 0-552-12620-9 edition.) The world created and described by Tepper has quite a lot of  depth and detail, but which isn't all presented right in front of you: it  was very enjoyable to read the first time, but only by rereading the book  can you start to put the pieces together to reveal a greater sense of the  interconnectedness of everything.

This is quite a thorough reference book for Baum's The Wonderful Wizard of Oz. It contains about 70 pages of biographical information about Baum, a history of the Oz series including some color plates, and related  discussions; a reproduction of The Wonderful Wizard of Oz printed with  correct colors with thorough annotations; a 20 page section about W. W.  Denslow's illustrations beyond the collaboration with Baum; and 20 pages of  bibliography.<BR><BR>Hearn makes a point of saying that the reproduction of  the Wizard reproduces the colors correctly; this is probably less of an  issue now that high quality facsimile editions are available, unlike say  the Dover edition of 1960. There are plenty of annotations, often fairly  long, which are interesting but aren't in the category of opening up whole  new worlds of perspective on the book. There are also some b&amp;w photos  and some other illustrations which hadn't been previously published. The  Annotated Wizard is probably most of interest to those with a particular  fascination about Oz, and those who are interested in a historical  perspective and context for Baum's first Oz book.

The bulk  of the book makes detailed comparisons between aspects of Tenniel's  illustrations and other similar illustrations and artwork by Tenniel and  his contemporaries, including Dodgson's own illustrations for &quot;Alice's  Adventures Under Ground&quot;, and a lot of comparison with  &quot;Punch&quot; illustrations, where Tenniel worked. The working  relationship between Dodgson and Tenniel is discussed, and Hancher also  describes the exacting extent to which both perfectionists wanted their  work done as best as possible, such as the very tight correlation between  text and layout of the illustrations demanded by Dodgson.<BR>  <BR>  A good  reference item for people interested in children's book illustrations of  the period, or of the original Tenniel-illustrated editions of Alice in  particular. 150 large-format (29 x 26 cm) landscape pages, with many black  &amp; white illustrations from Punch, the Macmillan editions of Alice,  Dodgson's handwritten manuscript, and other illustrations and artwork, on  only fair-quality paper.	2000-01-16

After begging from Alice that these stories be written in a  book, Charles Dodgson wrote a draft, and from this carefully handwrote and  illustrated &quot;Alice's Adventures Under Ground&quot;, which he gave to  Alice Liddell. Later, Charles used his draft to rewrite the stories in a  much expanded version which was published by Macmillan as &quot;Alice's  Adventures in Wonderland&quot;, and then went on to write &quot;Through the  Looking-Glass&quot;.   &quot;Alice's Adventures Under Ground&quot; is a  facsimile edition of the handwritten and hand illustrated manuscript, which  now resides in the British Museum. There have been previous facsimile  editions published, such as from Macmillan and Dover, but in black and  white only. This color facsimile is extremely well done: the quality of the  thick yellow paper is excellent, as is the brown printing. These, along  with the color reproduction of the cover and attribution pages, combine to  provide a great looking book that feels so wonderful to handle.   And of  course the story itself is marvelously enjoyable, and many of the same  episodes which became Alice's Adventures in Wonderland can be seen in this  precursor to that work.	2000-01-06

I picked up a copy of this when they were being remaindered for US$3.15 at my local major-chain bookstore. I love the idea of something new in the realm of sexuality education for young children - there're enough books  around for young children, but to have a board game is a good idea for  really opening up laughter, fun and openness around sexuality.<br />The set  contains a playing board that's 43 x 38 cm when unfolded, a die and four  playing tokens, a 24 page softcover booklet (22 x 22 cm), and a 6 page  parents' guide.<br />From the parent's guide: &quot;In the book, a child tells  about how he came into the world. The language is clear and direct, and  children can identify with the story. The father and mother are pictured in  their daily routine; there is nothing to surprise young readers. The  parents whisper sweet nothings to each other, but they also argue, they are  late in the morning, they have to cook dinner, etc. The tone is humerous,  which children love when it comes to talking about adults. ... The parents  argue about the division of household tasks on page 10 (both of them have  jobs), and end up making dinner together on page 11. This conveys a  non-sexist image of man-woman relations.&quot;<br />The board game tells the  story of the development of a child in the uterus from shortly after  conception until just before birth.	1999-02-03

Will an open physical environment have negative effects on the personalities and sexual  development of young people? Will seeing their parents nude cause children  to develop what some experts call an over-balanced attachment to mother and  father, and seduction anxiety? Or, as other experts believe, will nude  experiences in the physically open family inevitably lead to incest, create  terrible guilts and frustrations, and arouse parent-child rivalries? Will  the children in families where nudity is common be the victims of more  school failures and posess more sexual obsessions than those reared in  families where nudity is not allowed? [...]<br />&quot;[This] is the report on  a study which addresses the questions listed above and gives the reader a  chance to compare the opinions of the experts with the real-life  experiences of adults who grew up in open physical environments. This book  is the result of five years of research and writing plus added years for  follow-up on some of the cases. _Growing Up Without Shame_ represents the  first systematic attempt at studying the effects of a physically open  environment. We know this study is the first. We hope it is not the  last.&quot;<br />I found this book an easy, enjoyable read; it appears to give  serious consideration to the topic, reviewing experts' opinions and  researching the views of people who grew up in open environments. A more  technical examination of the data from the research is given in an  appendix.<br />Also contains a number of b&amp;w photos from nudist  environments, although these photos seem purely to brighten up the pages,  since they have no direct connection to the text where they are placed.	1999-01-28

Ok, this is a bit of a heavier, academic-type book, although the writing style is easy enough to read.<br />Bernstein has interviewed many children about their understanding about sexuality, particularly in terms of  pregnancy, birth and family structure. The book is filled with examples of  what children say and think, which can be fun to read.<br />Bernstein  separates children's responses into six rough stages of mental development,  which turn out to be fairly clearly differentiated. In each stage, she  describes and explains how children think, giving examples of what children  have said in interviews with her. She then also suggests how to talk to  children of each stage, taking into account their understanding and way of  thinking at that time.<br />There are also chapters on adoption and  stepfamilies, and generally how to discuss and make sense of the great  variety of family structures children encounter, and how children  understand them.<br />It's reasonably fun reading, if you have the  concentration to read through it all, and the desire to think about  yourself and your situation, and how you may improve your communication and  the understanding of the children you encounter.	1999-01-05

Its 27 pages contain just text that has come from someone's  laser printer, complete with a few typos and formatting problems. Ok, the  reproduction of those laser printouts is high; I have no complaint with the  quality of the reproduction. But it contains no illustrations or pictures  of any sort, although the front and back covers are colorful and cheery  (although irrelevant to the subject matter).<br />The actual text of the book  is noticably straight-forward and open, more so than other straight-forward  and open books. I like the way that it makes it clear upfront that there  are two objectives of contraception, to prevent (1) pregnancy, and (2)  disease. The remainder of the book generally discusses prevention of  pregnancy only, though; discussing the various types of  contraceptives.<br />The content of the text is very well written, but the  text doesn't deserve to be sold alone, unillustrated, at such a high price.  The title of this book is a bit misleading too; it's not specifically about  the condom, but rather about contraceptives generally. Discussion about  condoms takes up two pages of the text.	1999-01-02

Now _this_ is a sexuality education book for younger children different from any other I have seen. A breath of fresh air! 56 pages, black &amp; white, line illustrations throughout.<br />The book designed for pre-pubescent  children who are old enough to read (maybe age 5 to 12). The style of the  book is quite like a school workbook, though I don't think that's a  turn-off in this case. The text of the book talks directly to the reader,  not speaking abstractly. It's a workbook since on almost every page there  is space for the reader to draw a picture, write a response on the line  provided, or tick the box that best describes what they think or feel. The  illustrations invite coloring in.<br />The content of the book specifically  does not talk much about how babies are made or born, but rather about  other aspects of sexuality, specifically how the reader feels about  themself. The reader might want to just read the book, or fill it in and  keep it secret, or show someone what they have done.<br />I personally don't  like Marcia Quackenbush's illustrations that much, though others disagree.  (She also illustrated &quot;Period&quot; in the same style).<br />This is a  unique book (as far as I know), and I recommend it as something a bit more  interactive than simple information books. I think it'd be interesting to  give a copy of the book to a child multiple times as they grow up,  documenting their growing maturity about what they think and feel.	1999-01-02

There is a simple foreword and  introduction in four languages at the start, plus one page showing the  location of body parts within a vulva (again in four languages), but  otherwise no text.<br />To be honest, reading other people's comments about  this book, I wonder whether they are talking about this book.  &quot;Offensive subtext&quot;? Material of a &quot;prurient nature&quot;? A  book of humor? Only in the sense that perhaps some people may not take a  coloring in book of vulvas seriously.<br />Anyway, this book is an interesting  companion to Femalia, which contains actual photographs of vulvas. I'd rate  this book higher if it were of higher quality.	1999-01-02

The Body in Question was  and remains essential reading for anyone involved in criticizing, producing  (or reproducing), exhibiting, collecting, or legislating on contemporary  art. It raises some of the most important questions of our time --  questions of censorship, of AIDS information, of sexuality and gender, and  of that ever-shifting ground, public morality. Repression often breeds  overreaction -- an automatic reflex of defending controversial art without  necessarily getting the arguments right. The Body in Question is far more  thoughtful and focused,showing us again that openness breeds tolerance,  the basis of humanity and discovery.&quot; -- Anthony Korner, Publisher,  Artforum International.<br />&quot;Every page of The Body in Question helps us  to see and think in new ways. The book is a beautiful reminder of how  precious it is to see and think for ourselves.&quot; -- Leanne Katz,  Executive Director, National Coalition Against Censorship.<br />&quot;The  accompanying text leaves no room for misinterpretation: angry, thoughtful  essays ... explicate the dangerous times we live in and the necessity of  speaking the forbidden.... What [the photographs] tell is, beyond their  having a right to visual representation, is that our bodies are  tremendously mutable, exuberantly plastic, capable of registering countless  pains and pleasures.&quot; -- Stacey D'Erasmo, The Village Voice, January  15, 1991.<br />Back cover summary:<BR> &quot;The arts in this country have  come under increasing attack from political and religious leaders concerned  that certain works undermine public morality. The current climate of pious  outrage endangers a growing range of artistic expression, as self-appointed  censors attempt to impose their moral judgments and tastes through  political intimidation and legal threats.<br />&quot;Focusing on censorship,  the representation of AIDS, domestic violence, gender, sexuality, and other  concerns, The Body in Question is a major contribution to the growing  national debade about questions of artistic freedom and personal and  societal rights. Much of the photographic work that has recently been  attacked is presented here, along with insightful essays about these  important and timely questions. The Body in Question throws new light on  the issues behind the current furor over artistic expression and  censorship.&quot;	1998-12-08

I bought this book because it's illustrated by Arthur Robins, the  illustrator of the &quot;Where Did I Come From?&quot; series of books, and  indeed this book is marketed as being another book in the series -- and  it's size and style matches &quot;Where Did I Come From?&quot;. As a book  in this series, this book matches the quality, style and humor, and I'm  pleased to have it.<br />As for the subject matter -- having to wear glasses  -- I don't feel able to comment so well. It's written for children who do  have to wear glasses (or children who can empathise with those who do), but  perhaps don't understand why they have to wear glasses and other kids  don't. It explains the modern benefit that glasses provide people with  problem vision, gives an eye-anatomy lesson, tries to illustrate blurred  vision, discusses seeing an eye doctor, and how wearing glasses is  beneficial.<br />27 x 27 cm, 44 pages, color cartoon-style drawings, large  print.	1998-10-17

This is an extremely beautiful  book!<br />I bought this book as a photographic work, although there is  running text along with all the photographs. It's primarily about the joy  and great value of introducing babies and children to water and swimming in  a supportive environment, and it also has a good chapter on water birth.	1998-10-17

I bought the book because  it is so beautiful, and not so much because of the actual content of the  photographs.<br />It's a photographic work -- apart from some  &quot;introductory&quot; text in English and German, the book is filled  with large black and white photographs with no captions or text. Most of  the photos are full page, with the occasional two-page photo, and a  fold-out section in the middle.<br />All of the photographs are of women --  sensual, mildly erotic. Heterosexual males will probably find the book very  attractive.	1998-10-17

It contains 32 color  photographs of womens' vulvas; the photographs are extremely high quality,  extremely beautiful, and extremely well printed. I like to show the book to  as many people as I can; I think it's a brilliant book that all people  should consider owning.

US	52585804	R2PC9OQ41GBHAL	0312722753	617109613	Show Me!: A Picture Book of Sex for Children and Parents (English and German Edition)	Books	5	88	93	N	N	For ultra-progressive parents only; superb!	176 pages, 217 x 302 mm (slightly larger than A4), 69 extra-large  photographs (two-page spreads), 56 small photographs, a number of tiny  photographs. All photographs black and white; no illustrations, 36 pages of  explanatory text.<br />This is a book that will be considered superb by  ultra-progressive parents, children, and by pedophiles. Most parents, even  liberally-minded ones, will find this book confronting and offensive.  Disclaimer: I am an ultra-progressive parent, and my views are not those of  the majority.<br />This is a superb book for children and parents as a  resource to discuss sexuality in an ultra-progressive context. It begins  with 138 pages (69 double-page spreads) of black and white photographs  which are excellent quality, very gentle, beautiful, empathetic. Some of  the photographs are extremely explicit; the most explicit include erect  boys' penises and adults copulating. The photographs are accompanied by a  running dialog between some of the children and adults photographed, eg:  &quot;But I've got a PENIS and YOU don't.&quot;, &quot;SO WHAT? I've got a  VAGINA instead!&quot;<br />The 138 pages of large photographs are followed by  36 pages of explanatory text by Dr. Fleischhauer-Hardt, for parents, which  also include smaller photographs of a similar nature; the text discusses  sexuality and discussing sexuality with children.<br />This book is long out  of print, because of the hassle Will McBride has received over the book,  and the reluctance of any publisher to take it on. It is, however, followed  by Zeig Mal Mehr! (Show Me More!), which is currently in print in Germany,  but has never been published in English. And Will McBride hopes one day to  be able to write &quot;Show Me More Again!&quot;, the third in the  series.<br />Absolutely excellent for the few of us who are progressive  enough, but this book will go strongly against the value system of most  parents. I have spoken with two sexologists and two psychologists aboutthis book; they agree that it will offend most adults, but is useful for  the few who are sufficiently liberal-minded.	1998-10-14

The content is clever  and funny, but what I think I don't like is the style of the illustrator's  cartoons. I'm pleased to _have_ the book, as part of my Mayle collection,  but I wouldn't actually recommend it to anyone to read.	1998-09-02

Although it is a fairly light, fast read, it isn't quite a children's book  -- more designed for adults who enjoy Alice.	1998-09-02

With that in mind, and  the fact that I haven't read the actual text of the book closely: the book  is illustrated with 24 color photographs and numerous color pencil  drawings. The reproduction quality is only ok. This is the best  photographic book about baby massage I've found so far, but I haven't  stopped looking.	1998-09-02

Fremantle Arts  Centre Press.<br />I'm very surprised to see this book appear in Amazon's  catalog. The book contains many black and white photographs of Perth,  Fremantle and other areas in Western Australia from days of old (long  before I was born) and hence this book appealed to me, so that I had a  record of what my home city was like before I was born. From that point of  view, the book is certainly very adequate and recommended, although I  suspect it would have very limited appeal to anyone who is not familiar  with Perth, Australia.	1998-09-02

(Edition reviewed: &quot;The Joy of Birth : A Book for Families to  Share&quot;, London : Methuen Children's Books Ltd, 1987). 64 pages, 21.7 x  27.5 cm<br />This book is as much a photographic work as anything else; the  photos (108 of them, black &amp; white) are beautiful. Beginning from  pregnancy, going through labor, birth, the first week, babies needing  special care, and finishing with toddlerhood growing up, photographs are  accompanied by light text which is wonderfully empathetic, gentle, and can  be read by children on their own or with their parents.<br />Some of the  photos are a bit 1970s-ish, and the book could be improved by having color  photos too.	1998-08-29

This book is not afraid of using good illustrations in an  appropriate way -- for example, it's not afraid of using an illustration of  a naked person where useful (whereas most books avoid nudity except where  they absolutely have to).<br />The book is full of good text describing the  body system in question, paralleled with funny cartoon drawings and jokes  from the cartoon characters. Children will find this book easy to read and  enjoyable, although I think sometimes the jokes are a bit oblique and may  distract from what is trying to be explained (unless a parent is present to  explain how the joke fits in to the topic being discussed).	1998-08-29

Instead, it is broken into 27 chapters including not only chapters  titled (for example) &quot;Oral Sex&quot;, &quot;Growing Up&quot;, and  &quot;Birth Control&quot;; but also chapters like &quot;Words and  Graffiti&quot;, &quot;The Liberators&quot;, and &quot;In the Sex  Store&quot;. Each chapter discusses a number of topics. This book is  notable for discussing a very wide range of topics most books would not  mention. Dense print -- it'd take a long time to read from cover to cover,  highly informational.<br />Lots of illustrations, varying from small line  drawings through to full-page color photographs, although the print quality  is only average.<br />The book is good for its information and illustration  content, but it doesn't lend itself to bedtime reading or being idly  browsed; it's a bit heavy-going. In comparison, a book like  &quot;Sexwatching&quot; by Milton Diamond (which I rate 5 stars), although  not as diverse and dense in content, has much better visual appeal and can  be much more easily enjoyed.	1998-08-29

Books	5	8	8	N	N	Understanding Christian Heaven, positive discussion of death	Just as brilliant now as it was 20+ years ago when it was first published,  this book for young readers discusses the varying ideas and attitudes to  (Christian) Heaven, and death and dying. It also promotes an acceptance of  death, almost non-existant in Western societies. This book is for children  who are in Western society where Christian beliefs are known, but young  readers need not be from Christian families themselves for this book to be  very useful in helping them understand death and the Christian ideas of  Heaven.<br />Finally, the book emphasises that what is important, whatever  your belief systems, is to be kind, to tell the truth, to be happy (and it  explains _how_ to do each of these things).	1998-08-29

Also published as &quot;Let's Talk about Sex&quot; in the  UK.<br />This is the best sexuality education book for children I've seen (I  have been looking at many). Visually, the book presents extremely well --  it's in color throughout, has enjoyable pictures (colored pencil drawings),  and is not afraid of using nudity in pictures. It contains some great  cartoons animating the processes of menstruation (&quot;The Travels of the  Egg&quot;), ejaculation (&quot;The Travels of the Sperm&quot;), pregnancy  (&quot;The Further Adventures of the Egg and Sperm&quot;), and birth  (&quot;What a Trip!&quot;).<br />The attitudes expressed are excellent,  beginning with the bird and bee characters expressing different feelings  about learning about sexuality -- the bird finds everything facinating and  is very positive towards learning more; the bee feels more hesitant,  wanting time to feel ready. The positive attitude towards nudity I've  mentioned already; the attitudes towards (for example) homosexuality,  non-nuclear families, race, and masturbation demonstrate an acceptance of  difference, a respect for others, and a positive attitude to it all.<br />If  you are going to get only one book about sexuality, growing up and  adolescence, this is the book to buy. If you're going to get several books,  this is the first book to get!	1998-08-28

Uses correct words, simple language, humor, fun and empathy. Cartoonish illustrations.<br />This book is a little dated now - there are some language issues. <br />Topics are covered _very_ briefly. Indeed, since so much is covered so quickly, the book can be a bit confusing. However, the book is extremely good, popular, recommended, easily readable by young readers by themselves, and can provide a good oportunity for education between parents and children. But I'd suggest you also buy another sexuality education book for your child to provide different presentations of this important subject!	1998-07-19

A photographic, autobiographical work covering McBride's life up to the 1970s (&quot;To be continued&quot;). Excellent, high quality photographs of McBride's work, including some controversial items. Text in German and English, with emotionally sad overtone. This is a large, physically heavy, high quality book - but many photographs are printed as a spread across facing pages, causing the inevitable problem that the photos are marred by being broken across the binding in the middle.<br />McBride's work is hard to come by, most of it having been published in magazines, and in books now out of print. This book provides an overview of the incredibly vast quantity of photographs taken by McBride over his life, and it creates a longing to own a much more comprehensive set of his photos, as photographic prints (or on CDROM?) without the binding breaking up the photos.	1998-07-04
