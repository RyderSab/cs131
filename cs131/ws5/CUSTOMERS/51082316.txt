I'm not offended by that kind of humor (although I don't usually find bathroom humor all that amusing), but it left me feeling the book didn't belong in the same class as BAD CAT.   <br /> <br />I was glad to see BAD DOG, being a dog lover, but I wish it had been as funny as BAD CAT.  I can see where some parents wouldn't want their kids to read this book.  Still, there are some funny photos and pages, so it's worth a peek for the adults or older kids.	2005-10-11

It's an original novel on vengeance, based on a condition known as \\"vagina dentata.\\"  I had heard of this condition, although I don't know if any such thing has ever been proven, but it sure makes for an interesting weapon!  <br />You'll have fun reading this unless you're really squeamish.  If you like horror or thrillers, this one's unique and well-written.  Van Belkom has a strange mind, and that's a good thing.<br />The previous reviewer has already told you some things about the novel, so I'm not going into much detail, because I want to leave you with a reason to read the book.  It's worth the money.	2002-05-07

I never felt bored with any part of it.<br />The action begins right away, as we learn about Mansa Du Paul, who uses his gifts for evil, sacrificing children to his dark gods.  Mansa gets his comeuppance, but it's only a temporary setback, as he's much too powerful to be kept silent.  <br />Many years later, a Native American guards the area where Mansa is buried, but the evil escapes and possesses a little girl.  Her parents and the Native American (I've forgotten his name, but &quot;Jimmy&quot; keeps coming to mind) have only a short time to save the girl.  <br />This is a real page-turner, and well worth the money.	2001-06-02

I didn't know quite what to expect when I picked up this book on Amazon, and was surprised to find that it was shorter than expected.  But don't let the size fool you--there are great tales in this one.<br />A man whose once-beautiful garden withers and dies, a new girl in town who finds some of the other kids have strange rules for making friends, and a boy whose mother seems a bit controlling are amongst those who encounter the Carousel.  These were some of my favorite tales.  Charles Grant offers twists and turns and things aren't what you expect, adding up to a terrific novel.<br />Grant writes well and keeps things interesting, strange and horrible things happening all along.  I would have loved to read even more tales of the Black Carousel.  I think you will, too.	2001-04-21

It would have played out well as either, but it does get a little confusing with the two genres overlapping.  However, it's still a good read.<br />When loner Richard Rokeby forms a friendship with Jonathan Palmer, Jonathan's life changes.  Those who bullied him are afraid of Richard.  Even the teachers are afraid of him.  Richard isn't afraid of anyone.<br />When Jonathan stays with Richard during a half-holiday, they discover a Ouija board in an old trunk belonging to Richard's aunt.  The Ouija board allows Richard and Jonathan to seek revenge on those who have crossed them.  But Jonathan doesn't really want anyone hurt, and he begins to see his relationship with Richard may not be such a good thing.<br />Richard is cold, full of hate.  He blames his father for his mother's suicide, and refuses to forgive him.  He lost his mother:  He has no intention of losing Jonathan, too.  Jonathan wants his old friends back, but is terrified of Richard.  He knows Richard is evil and can do terrible things.  If only Richard could be stopped...	2001-02-18

The dead get back up, walk around their (former) homes for a while, then head out on a journey.  Everyone's trying to figure out why this is going on, and where the dead are going.  When you finally find out why it's happening, the story does get a bit more interesting.  Unfortunately, until you get there, it's kind of slow-going.	2001-02-18

I flipped through this book in my local bookstore and knew I had to have it.  I absolutely loved it!  Susan Jane Gilman not only makes a lot of great points concerning feminism, love, being assertive, and more.  Her sense of humor is great and lightens up the more serious issues. <br />I agree with most of her beliefs and opinions, and it was like reading a letter from a best friend for me.  Being a Smartmouth Goddess is about being a strong woman and not losing one bit of your femininity.<br />If you consider yourself an open-minded modern woman, check this one out.  It's a great title to put on your bookshelf.  I believe that Susan Jane Gilman is an author is an author to watch out for.	2001-02-18

However, some kids escape, find each other and form a survival group.  Together, they'll fight the adults and try to figure out what's happening.  <br />Readers won't figure out the cause of the adult population's loss of sanity.  It's not what you might expect.  You'll get a surprise ending that hasn't been done before, to my knowledge.<br />Will the kids survive?  Will the adults return to normal?  How widespread is the problem?  Why isn't there one pregnant female adult in the entire story (I'm curious if she'd rip out her stomach to destroy the fetus)?  Well, you'll just have to read BLOOD CRAZY to find out.	2001-02-18
US	51082316	R2MPCXKJ5DX6IF	0843943289	280456997	Sheik	Books	4	6	9	N	N	Typical But Enjoyable	SHEIK follows the same plot as many romances, but it's still a fun read.  The hero, Sheik Jamal, is arrogant and sexist, of course, and is stunned by the idea of women as men's equals when the beautiful Berber heroine, Zara, suggests it to him.  <br />One of the things I liked was that Jamal is also a pirate.  Of course, most of the novel takes place on land, so don't expect pirating adventures here.  <br />Jamal is the typical sexist hero, touching and groping his concubines and Zara as he pleases.  Being a modern woman, I found this rather annoying, but romance novels often star a hero who can molest women and arouse them at the same time.  No difference here--Zara doesn't want to be turned on by the sheik, but of course, she is.<br />Zara is the daughter of the leader of the Berbers and is strong and independent.  She's taken to the short-tempered Sultan after being captured by Jamal and his men, but Jamal finds he doesn't want the Sultan to have her, so he comes up with a plan to keep her with him.  Jamal's three concubines aren't pleased, especially when he begins to neglect them in favor of Zara.  <br />The two grow more fond of one another, and as their love grows, so does the danger.  The Sultan has wanted Zara's father Youssef's head for a long time, and would just as easily kill Zara.  Jamal, too, incurs the Sultan's wrath, and they must find a way to save themselves.  Although predictable, this is a fun, erotic novel.	2000-12-27

I didn't really know what it was about, except that it was a horror novel that had to do with Santa.  I'm always up for that, but nothing could have prepared me for this book!<br />While Devereaux isn't the first to eroticize Santa, he's done it in a way I've never seen before.  And it's not just Santa that's looking for a good time.  Sex is everywhere in this fairy tale.  Just when you think you've seen the peak of outrageousness, Devereaux goes one step beyond.  <br />This is one of the most original novels of any genre I've ever read.  Almost everyone is someone who they didn't used to be.  It's so outrageous it's downright hysterical!  I dare not say too much because new readers deserve all the surprises this title holds.<br />Another thing I liked was that Devereaux actually explains the history of how this book came into being, and why he wrote it.  While I read it, I kept thinking, What's this guy smoking???  Devereaux has the unique ability to open his mind and let everything spill forth, no holding back.  As one reviewer stated, it's not for the easily offended, but if you, too, have an open mind, you'll enjoy this wild ride of sex, love, and perversion.	2000-12-06

It starts out with a murder and a beheading, and the fun's only just begun.  A couple discover the victim and her killer in the morning, and the killer runs off with the head.  Enter the police.  Now the search is on to catch the man who did it.<br />A couple of punk kids may have some answers, but they're not interested in sharing.  Sheriff Hodges intends to persuade them, however.  He and &quot;The Pac&quot; aren't going to let this guy get away.<br />The story offers surprises and even a twist, and Laymon does a good job of not giving away anything until the moment it happens.  However, one flaw in the book is poor character development of Bass.  Fortunately, the rest of the book makes up for this.	2000-11-11

I noticed that a lot of copies had been sold from my local bookstore, but  I don't usually buy a book just for that reason.  This time, I did.  I like  thrillers, but I'm picky about them.  I just got the feeling I should buy  this one since it seemed so popular.  I'm glad I did!<br />The first pages  drew me in and I never got bored with the book.  A horrible murder is left  unsolved, and a cop is driven to suicide.  Eighteen years later, his  daughter has followed her father's footsteps and re-opens the case.  More  murders follow, and she must deal with the fact that her very own brother  may be the killer.<br />The ending surprised me and I didn't guess who it was  until a few paragraphs before it was revealed.  Alice Blanchard is an  author I'm going to watch!  DARKNESS PEERING will keep you guessing.	2000-08-27

Jessica isn't appreciative of her mother's  violent tendencies, but we never understand our parents when we're young.   She'll realize how wonderful her Mommy is when she inevitably turns into  her, as all of us young women do.<br />I was disappointed with the writing  style, however:  It's as if a teenager wrote this book.  Collins had a good  idea but his technique is lacking.  Also, like many authors, he doesn't  grasp childhood; many authors seem to make their young characters smarter  and much more mature than most kids are.  That's fine once in a while, but  it happens all too often.<br />Mommy is more of a villain in MOMMY than she is  in MOMMY'S DAY, but she will fulfill your fantasies of the mom who will  stand up for you.  We should all have mommies who care so much.<br />Jessica  better learn to appreciate her mother soon, though.  She doesn't want Mommy  to get mad at her.  When the person who loves you turns on you, who do you  turn to?<br />Hey, psychotics need love, too.	2000-07-08

I don't know how factual it is on Molokan  culture, since I know nothing of them, but I enjoyed it nonetheless.<br />The  Town is somewhat different than Little's other novels in that everything  doesn't become madness as quickly as usual.  I've usually enjoyed Little's  writing except for the fact that it's often predictable.<br />Some of the  things that happen in this book are downright funny--wait till you meet  Lurlene!--although I'd have liked more humor in it.  Mom was a bit sappy,  too.  Dad was the most boring character, though.<br />Go ahead and grab this  one.	2000-07-08

I quickly tired of the Saf Dar, wishing there'd been more action sooner.  <br />I was extremely annoyed that every time a piece of information was about to be  revealed, someone interrupted.  Chris was about to show his wife the shells  his son had given him, but she cut him off.  His son was about to take him  into the basement, and someone interrupted.  It happens all through the  book.<br />Chris is a terribly henpecked husband.  His wife raises a finger  and he knows to obey.  His son is the typical horror novel kid:  Smarter  and more mature than his age.  Why can't kids be kids?<br />The ending was  interesting; this wasn't a horrible book.  But it was frustrating getting  to the end.   Finally, maybe it was just that I got a copy from a bad batch  of printed books, but virtually every instance of &quot;Mr.&quot; and  &quot;Mrs.&quot; left off the period.  It was very annoying.  Overall, I  felt this book was a *sacrifice* of my time.	2000-07-02

This one doesn't.  The two reviewers before me aren't exaggerating about the &quot;he was a cop&quot; thing.  Maybe Schmidt should have titled  it as such.<br />I don't like animals being hurt or killed, even in stories,  but even that didn't make me hate this cult more than the main character.   However, the cult was corny!  They chanted the usual stuff, and all the  Satanic and evil symbols were thrown around haphazardly.  Black circles,  inverted pentagrams and crosses, black candles, and body parts are just put  together without rhyme or reason.  And I never exactly understood the  bald-headed leader with the black eyes; was he human, possessed, or  what?<br />This story might have been better had the main character drank  himself to death in the very beginning and let someone else be the main  character.	2000-06-18

My sister said it best:  &quot;Once you've read one of his books,  you've read them all.&quot;  But I wanted something to read and thought I'd  see if his more recent works would convince me to add him to my  &quot;favorite authors&quot; list.<br />While THE RIGHT HAND OF EVIL didn't  wow me, it at least seemed different than his usual stuff (keeping in mind  I'm talking about works I read back in the 80's).  It wasn't great, and was  similar to other haunted/possessed house stories I'd read by other authors,  but it was better than nothing.  I might give him another chance, if the  subject interested me, but I wouldn't expect greatness.  I hope he  surprises me next time.	2000-06-17

It's not a bad book to explain OCD, but there are better ones out there.  <br />Over and Over Again contains the usual information:  What OCD is like, some case examples,  treatment options, and the like.  Obviously, since it was written and  published some years ago, there is new information out there.  Still, this  will serve as a great reference.<br />If you write articles or books on OCD  and wish to cover the history of treatment, Over and Over Again will be  useful to gain information from the past.  <br />However, while it's  interesting reading, if you're looking for the most up-to-date information,  search for something more recently published.	2000-04-15

But soon, the pendulum predicts the same  thing over and over--UNSPEAKABLE HORRORS.<br />And this is where the story  really begins.  The little girl has to stop the evil that's  happening.<br /><br />Pendulum is something I'd recommend as one of the first  horrors for a teen.

I'd read parts of books with S&amp;M in them, but never a book specifically for S&amp;M fans.<br />I knew there'd be spanking and whipping, but this two-books-in-one story was violent!  Whipping, beating, rape, humiliation, slavery--and no mercy!  It through me for a loop, I must say!  The second story, The Peculiar Passions of Lady Meg, is a continuation of The Love Slave.<br />Underlying all the violence and abuse, however, is actually an interesting story of three women who try to save their dignity.  If you can get past the violence (or if you enjoy it but can see the underlying story), you might find Paul Little's ability to actually tell a story.	2000-04-02
