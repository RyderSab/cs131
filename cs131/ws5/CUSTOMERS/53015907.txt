Ms. Powers provides more than a blow by blow account of horror.  She recounts and analyzes the responses made to genocide by individuals and governments, primarily the US government.  Ms. Powers presents us with two horrendous facts: the fact of the genocides themselves and the fact of those who stand idly by while genocide is commited.  She condemns both.  Put starkly, she shows a United States willing to fight to defend things outside its border but not people outside its border.  We good and decent \\"realists\\" perceive our personal well-being to be dependent on things all over the world.  We do not perceive our well-being to be dependent on the well-being of people all over the world.  We did not perceive genocides of the Jews in Europe, of the Rwandans in Africa, the Armenians, Bosnians or Kurds in Europe and the Middle East or the Cambodians in Asia to threaten our well-being, unless and until that genocide threatened, as a kind of collateral damage, the things we believed we needed. <br />There are a few heroes: Raphael Lemkin, the people of Human Rights Watch and its predecessor organizations, the people of Amnesty International, Canadian Major General Romeo Dallaire, and a few State Department employees.  These stories alone make the book worth reading.  But there are no President heroes.  Wilson ignored the Armenian genocide, Franklin Roosevelt turned away Jews fleeing the Nazis, Carter, Reagan and Bush I ignored the Kurdish, Bosnian and Cambodian genocides, and Clinton somehow missed the Rwandan genocide until he learned to \\"feel their pain.\\"  Indeed, indifference did not mark the limits of US policy.  The US government supported Turkey, Iraq and the Pol Pot regime while they committed genocide.  Reagan and Bush I did not bother to bother Saddam Hussein about his gassing of the Kurds when it happened, but now, for Bush II, it's a convenient ploy in his call for war against him. <br />Genocide simply has not been a central concern of the US government.  When the US has acted, as it did in Bosnia and Kosovo, it has been forced to act, or acted out of embarassment. <br />Samantha Powers provides a clue as to why.  The clue is in the language.  When America's friend, ally and fellow freedom fighter, Saddam Hussein, was gassing his own citizens, Peter Galbraith, a staff member on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, traveled to Iraq and saw what Hussein was doing to the Kurds.  Despite his efforts, and the efforts of some Senators and Congress people, the US government went plodding along in its support of Saddam.  Galbraith's boss reported that there was a \\"backlash\\" against him.  \\"They would pooh-pooh him as `emotional.'\\"  (Page 228)   Powers also reports, re: Bosnia, that, \\"Most of the senior officials in the Bush (Bush I) administration, including ... Secretary of Defense Richard Cheney, ... and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Colin Powell, were traditional foreign policy \\"realists.\\"  The United States did not have the most powerful military in the history of the world in order to undertake squishy, humanitarian \\"social work.\\"\\"  (Page 261, my emphasis) Those who worked to stop the genocides, Powers writes, \\" were usually branded \\"emotional,\\" \\"irrational,\\" \\"soft,\\" or \\"naive.\\"\\" (Page 516) <br />\\"Emotional.\\"  \\"Irrational.\\"  \\"Squishy.\\"  \\"Soft.\\" \\"Humanitarian.\\"  \\"Social work.\\"  Women's work. <br />Four hundred years B.C.E., Sophocles wrote \\"Antigone.\\"  In that play, Creon, the king, forbids the burying of his enemy, Polynices, on pain of death.  But Polynices was Antigone's brother, and she buries him.  Before sentencing her to her death, Creon screams, \\"Go down below and love, if love you must - love the dead!  While I'm alive, no woman is going to lord it over me!\\"  Burying the dead and protecting the living has been decreed by king and president to be \\"women's work.\\"  Antigone replied, \\"Your wisdon appealed to one world - mine, another.\\"  (Robert Fagles, \\"Sophocles: The Three Theban Plays\\" Penguin Classics 1982)<br />Who's work is it then that governments do, that the dead who need burying grow and grow?  <br />What is left of a king or President or Secretary of State after he or she has sloughed off the emotional, the irrational, the squishy, the soft, the merely social?  <br />Samantha Powers shows us some answers.  Her book is riddled with such cardboard characters.  The fragment of a human being that remains is - and I choose the words intending full irony - as helpless as a woman when confronted by these greatest of evils.	2002-04-10

As the liberation theologian Gustavo Gutiérrez wrote, \\"Theology is reflection, a critical attitude.  The commitment of love, of service, comes first.  Theology follows; it is the second step.\\"  (Gustavo Gutiérrez: Essential Writings, James B. Nickoloff ed.)  Brock and Parker examine their lives and the abuse and violence they and others have suffered.  Their theology has roots in autobiography.  If this sounds radical, remember St. Augustine's \\"Confessions.\\"<br /> Brock and Parker find the costs of present atonement theology exorbitant.  They ask: what sort of god requires his son to die to redeem others' guilt?  (I use a small-g god to indicate god as a human concept which arises out of our lives, as did the idea that Jesus died for our sins.  St. Anselm thought it up in the twelfth century.  That doesn't make it wrong.  That makes it debatable.)  What sort of son would submit?  What sort of human being feels redeemed by such a death?  Does this theology twist god into being an abuser?  When a woman is sent back to her abusing husband who then kills her, how many murderers are there?<br />In telling their stories of the descent of violence, one generation to the next, and the struggle to understand and contain it, and the descent of love, one generation to the next, and the struggle to embody and inflame it, Brock and Parker work the idea of atonement into something closer to its original meaning: at-one-ment.  They find they cannot leave God behind.  (Big-G God.)  It's God who gets them through.  Their stories are hard and demanding.  Theirs is a scathingly honest, no punches pulled, gut level theology.<br />This issue is not angels-on-pin-head academic.  We Christians continue to cause our share of suffering and death in the world.  How does our idea of god play into our own penchant for violence?  If god demanded, for his own purposes, that his son submit to suffering and death, then it is only (super)natural that we demand, for our purposes, the same of our sons, daughters, wives, neighbors and enemies.  But if Christ's mission was to teach us how to relate to each other and his justice, mercy, kindness and charity proved so threatening to us that we killed him - we have a very different Christianity.  We have a very different God.  <br />\\"Proverbs of Ashes\\" is powerful and engrossing.  It is not a book to be taken lightly.	2002-03-25

Interspersing interviews with the powerful and humble with historical sketches, he conducts a harrowing tour of Liberia, Congo-Zaire, South Africa, the Sudan, Uganda and Rwanda.  Despite the endless slaughters, Africa, he shows us, is not the \\"dark\\",  mysterious or frighteningly \\"other\\" place we commonly think.  It is unfamiliar.  For that we have no one to blame but ourselves.  <br />Berkeley's thesis is that Africa's problems do not originate in ancient \\"tribal\\" animosities.   Without providing historical background (though he indicates where it is to be found), he begins by observing that, before the arrival of colonizing Europeans, Africa was a functioning continent, that is, neither heaven nor hell, but functioning.  The colonizers - he speaks primarily of the British and Belgians - ruled through what might be called \\"divide and exploit.\\"   Where there were tribal differences, the Europeans created animosity by using one group as their proxy to oppress another.   Where there were no tribes, the Europeans created them, as in Rwanda, and set one over the other.  The colonizers thought this worked well, and, from their skewed view, it did.  They made their money and got out, telling themselves that ripping off a continent was the same as civilizing it.  Those who'd been unfortunate enough to have served their colonial sentence at the bottom of the heap tended toward resentment.  Those who has served as the Euroman's proxies tended toward fear.  What we like to call \\"tribal\\" is nothing more than post-Colonial class war.  <br />And we all - Americans, Europeans, Soviets and Africans - love to manipulate the situation for private gain: the ripping off of Africa, chapter two.  That's the story Berkeley tells and tellsvery well.   Whether he's interviewing an American policy expert who invokes \\"tribalism\\" to justify supporting the most evil thugs and refusing to stop the slaughter, or the South African police who use \\"tribalism\\" to set African against African to keep South Africa under white domination, or the African leader (who is likely to possess a degree, even a doctorate, from a prestigious American university) who rises to power on a slogan of \\"tribalism\\", Berkeley shows that \\"tribalism\\" is a myth for all seasons.<br />Berkeley is not shy about confronting leaders with the massive death their quests for power have spawned.  Each bemoans the violence, yet each answers that he has no regrets about his role in it.  None.  Most of those interviewed are now dead, dead of conflict or \\"natural\\" causes.  Those who remain among the living will, in the not too distant future, be dead.  Their lives, their slaughters, their shallowness and indifference can be summed up in a few dozen pages.   They created nothing except death.  <br />The Africa Berkeley reveals is not so different from the \\"rest of the world.\\"  \\"Tribes\\", corporations, governments tend to fall somewhere along the spectrum of mafia-like organizations.  Africa is like everywhere else, only, for now, a little more so. <br />The only criticism I would offer is I would like to have learned about the resisters, those who struggle for food, housing, medical care, freedom and human rights.  That Berkeley thought them outside the scope of the book tends, despite his own best efforts, to reenforce the stereotype of the \\"African.\\"	2002-03-19
US	53015907	R1OGN1J0GZ2UDD	1583224890	746847725	9-11	Books	4	35	42	N	N	Forgetting is democracy's enemy	If you haven't read Chomsky before, this is a decent introduction to one of the most controversial public commentators of our time.  You'll want to read more of his work when you're finished with this.<br />The book is a collection of interviews with Mr. Chomsky conducted between September 11 and October 15.  It will be a long time, if ever, before we are able to make sense out these attacks given the images the media floats before us.  We instinctively look for answers that are both safe and comforting.  However, too many people died on 9-11 and since for us to accept the easy answers.  We must have the courage to look fearlessly at ourselves and the rest of the world.        <br />Despite, or because of the focus on 9-11, Chomsky delves into the past fifty years of world history, particularly regarding U.S foreign policy.  As always, he allows the facts to speak for themselves.  In this sense he is much like I.F. Stone.  When the Kennedy administration was testing nuclear devices and claiming that a test ban was unenforceable because such tests were not detectable, Stone simply read the newspaper.  The government argued that we would have no way of knowing whether the Soviet Union violated a test ban.  Stone pointed out that in the same newspaper (I believe it was the New York Times) which carried the Kennedy administration's position on page one, the back pages carried short and unheralded reports from as far away as Australia that geologists reported their seismographs had clearly recorded the test.  Chomsky works out of the same tradition.  While other commentators attempt to put a spin of one sort or another on a story, Chomsky relentlessly places the facts before his readers and asks: what do these facts tell you?  <br />He also insists on applying the standards the U.S applies to other nations to the U.S.  If another nation claimed that the deaths of tens of thousands of children are an acceptable byproduct of its foreign policy, we would, of course, deploreit.  Madeline Albright defended U.S. policy toward Iraq in those words.  When our friends in Indonesia, Angola and Central America use tactics we label terrorist when used by bin Laden, our presidents call them \\"freedom fighters\\".   <br />Chomsky does not blame the U.S. for the 9-11 attacks.  Terrorists are responsible for their own acts.  He does, however, demonstrate that the U.S. conducts itself in a manner that helps create a world in which terrorism is not only acceptable but flourishes.<br />His insistence on focusing on the facts and applying standards universally maddens his critics.  Nothing is left for them to do but call him names.<br />This small book is a big boost for democracy.	2002-03-14

Richard E. Rubenstein's \\"When Jesus Became God\\" is the bloody and harrowing tale of the Arian controversy which divided the Church in the fourth century.  Arius and his followers believed Jesus was not God, that God was God and Jesus, although very close to God, occupied a somewhat lower level.  The anti-Arians argued that Jesus was God, and that Jesus took human form on earth.<br />What could be more irrelevant?  Wait.  <br />The battle lines were roughly drawn between the eastern and western Roman Empire.  Constantine, on his was to reuniting the Empire, fought the battle at Milvian Bridge and regained Rome.  Before that battle he claimed to have seen in the heavens a cross and words to the effect, \\"In this sign you shall conquer.\\"  Poor Constantine has a lawsuit for misrepresentation.  The sign in the heavens should have continued (even if only in the small print that insurance companies use)... Well, waving a banner with the cross on it, he did win the battle.  A few years later he reunited the whole of the Empire and the persecuted Christian Church became the official Christian Church.  To the victor belongs the right to spoil it. <br />Rubenstein recounts the theological debates and mob battles that rocked the Empire.  Nowhere could three bishops of a similar persuasion meet without excommunicating at least one bishop of a different persuasion.  Nowhere could three people gather on a street corner without discussing theology and going off to burn their favorite `heretic' church.  Councils met, made pronouncements, then another council met and pronounced the former council invalid.  Kings marched, armies fought, grain collected for the poor was sold to buy arms (Ah!  Now you begin to seed some relevance)...  Etc.  Etc.  It's all very exciting.<br />But, why?  First off, these theologians had a big ego problem and a certainty about their own ability to understand theprecise meaning of obscure concepts...  Well, actually, we don't know.  They didn't leave any testimony as to why dock workers, bar tenders, and prostitutes felt so involved in theological issues.  Yes, prostitutes.  One group of bishops snuck a prostitute into the hotel room of a visiting bishop to discredit him.  However, she woke the unsupecting bishop and everyone else in the hotel by creaming and told them who had sent her.  Apparently she held firm views on the Arian controversy.  By the way, she is one of the few women in this story.  The Arian controversy was a man's thing.<br />The question that bothers me is: who cares?  Or: why did they care?  The Gospels don't explain the Son of God/Son of Man thing.  Jesus didn't spend the Sermon on the Mount or the Sermon on the Plain explaining the difference between substance and essence.  In his regard, the Aian controversy is like today's debate about homosexuality.  Fundamentalists and conservatives cite three or four scriptural references which they allege condemn homosexuality.  I invite you to pick up a Bible some time (not buy, but lift it, although it's okay to buy) and check its heft.  How many pages does it have?  How many of those tiny, insurance policy size words on each page?  And they want to send people to hell on the basis of their interpretation of three or four phrases?  Just like both sides in the Arian controversy.<br />The anti-Arians won.  Sort of.  Gregory of Nyssa came up with the idea of the Trinity.  With no Arians to beat up, the anti-Arians went big time into burning synagogues.  <br />So, rumor has it that there was this guy who taught that we should love God, love our neighbors as ourselves, love our enemies and turn the other cheek.  He said we should feed the hungry, clothe the naked, give drink to the thirsty, visit the sick, console the sorrowful, and visit prisoners.  He said when we do those things, we do them also for him and when we don't, we deny him.  Well, it's only a rumor.I don't know what made me think about it.  Besides, there's no money in the budget for this sort of thing.	2002-02-20

A Buddhist monk who fled the American War in Vietnam, Thich Nhat Hanh leads a world-wide community centered at Plum Village in south-west France.  A critic and target of both the Communist regime and the U.S. backed South, he became well-known in America and a friend of Martin Luther King and Daniel Berrigan.  Just as Chinese political oppression forced Tibetan Buddhists onto the world stage, Thich Nhat Hanh's exile allowed the West to come to know Zen better.  <br />\\"Zen Keys\\" is one of his earlier books and, unlike many others, is not a meditation text.  \\"Zen Keys\\" is a serious introduction to the history and practice of Zen from the Buddha to the present.  And Zen is practice.  Unlike Western religions, Zen does not rely on dogma.  Zen and Buddhism are methods of enlightenment, coming to know the real world.  We have learned to \\"see\\" they world through reason and emotions.  Reason and emotions are not bad; they are insufficient to come to know the world.   \\"Reality, he writes, \\"is only reality when it is not grasped conceptually.\\"  (112)   <br />Zen is the practice through which we come to know the world.  Using some of Thich Nhat Hanh's books and other works, I have tried meditation.  No, I have not attained enlightenment, but I have discovered all too many ways in which I have failed to see reality.  Have I come to be a better human being because of \\"practice\\"?  You'll have to ask someone else.  And, yes, it is disconcerting - but so freeing - to realize that my idea of myself is a construct I've assembled over time and not who I am.  <br />As Thich Nhat Hanh points out, Zen and Buddhism do not lead to \\"navel-gazing\\". He is a proponent of engaged Buddhism, a modern term which reaches back to one of the oldest schools of Buddhism.   He writes that in living in the world we have created, \\"What we lack is not an ideology or a doctrine that will save the world.  What we lack ismindfulness of what we are, of what our situation really is.\\"  (155)<br />Take that, you Communists and Capitalists!	2002-02-13

He worked for Oxfam, one of the world's premier development and relief organizations.  In his work, he helped some of the poorest and hungriest people on this planet.  He believed his work vital, but he observed and raised questions.  He saw that what needed to be done frequently did not get done.  Vaux and his associates, over stressed and under funded, decided sometimes who would live and who would not.  Food and medical aid became entangled with politics and military action.  Many of the people helped were less than innocent and sometimes guilty of horrific crimes.  Helping the vulnerable, the most laudable of tasks, he found, can itself be corrupting. <br />What saves this book from becoming another \\"realist\\" tome about how awful and hopeless we humans are, is Vaux's willingness to probe his own psyche as well as others'.  We're often able to make ourselves quite comfortable with the assessment that the human race is, as Vaux states, \\"a species of exceptional brutality and cruelty\\" (page iv).  We object only when the accusation is made against ourselves.  If our accuser presses on and places before us our own behavior, we may admit that, yes, sometimes we have, under certain circumstances, acted brutally.  But, we hasten to explain: circumstances forced us to act so.  We had our reasons.  They made us do it.  It's a cruel world.  Vaux rejects this sophistry.  He admits, \\"the possibility that I too could be a killer.\\"  (184) By \\"killer\\" he does not mean that he could serve in a UN peacekeeping force.  He means he is fully capable of having been on the wrong side in Somalia, Bosnia or Rwanda.  <br />From this non-privileged position, Vaux recounts debates among Oxfam staff about the identity of the organization: will it aim to promote development or be an emergency relief action?  Should Oxfam deliver aid to a society that oppresses women to the point that women will not benefit from the aid - or should the organization try to save as many lives as possible, even if most of them will be male?  Will accepting help from one side in a conflict - in this case trucks with armed soldiers to deliver food - compromise Oxfam's neutrality and its future effectiveness?  <br />It is also from this position that he raises his most  fundamental issue.  Vaux points out that aid workers are in positions of power and that power corrupts.  Aid organizations and workers develop interests, organizational and personal, in seeing that acts are done in a certain way and that they receive credit.  \\"Saving lives,\\" he writes, \\"can be intoxicating, especially when people are weak and vulnerable.\\"  (94) \\"The motive of pity so easily interacts with the motive for cruelty, and the desire to help so easily becomes the desire for power. ....  Managers in the `disaster relief industry', like those in charge of homes for children or the elderly, have the opportunity to abuse power because they are dealing with vulnerable people.\\"  (95)  Pity becomes contempt.<br />But, Vaux argues, \\"Self-knowledge is the prerequisite of humanity.\\"  (72)  \\"(T)o be happy requires a(n) ... abandonment of self - an ability to rejoice in other's success and in the formation of their altruism.\\"  (180)   As another person has pointed out, aid may be something done to people.  Better is to do something for people.  But the best is to do something with people.  Only the worker who has abandoned \\"self\\" is able to work with people.	2002-02-06

Kaplan in his earlier works, including \\"The Ends of the Earth\\" and \\"An Empire Wilderness\\" used a keen eye and sharp pen to uncover the intricacies and ambivalences of human and political life at the turn of the millennium.  He has shown himself steady in the face of evil.  Based on his past record, a new work by Kaplan deserves close attention.<br />In \\"Warrior Politics\\", Kaplan attempts to provide an ethic of power for the twenty-first century.  He reaches back to Livy and Thucydides to find the roots of such an ethic.  (xx) (All numbers are to page references in the 2002 hardcover edition.)  He propounds a \\"pagan\\" ethos.  Unfortunately, he never defines \\"pagan\\".  He finds this ethos in the Greeks and Romans, and in the framers of the Constitution, Alexander Hamilton, Churchill, Ronald Reagan, Yitzhak Rabin and Henry Kissinger.  This \\"pagan\\" ethos seems not to include Ghengis Khan, Attila the Hun, the Vikings, Hitler, Stalin or Mao.  There are apparently \\"good\\" pagans and \\"bad\\" pagans, but Kaplan fails to explain the difference.  \\"Good\\" pagans have in common the beliefs that, citing James Madison, \\"men are beyond redemption\\" (xxi), that, citing Machiavelli,  \\"good men bent on doing good must know how to do bad\\" (53), and, quoting Hamilton, that \\"Men are ambitious, vindictive, and rapacious.\\" (63)<br />To his credit, Kaplan acknowledges the challenges we face.  Globalization and global warming present grave dangers. (4, 11)  The benefits of capitalism are not distributed equitably and \\"the more dynamic the capitalist expansion, the more unequal the distribution of wealth\\". (5) But Kaplan does not present these as problems requiring solutions.  He does not use the term, but I could not help thinking that he sees systemic problems much like ancient pagans saw forces they did not understand: as Fates.  Since he offers no suggestions which might deal with these problems, it is fair to conclude that he sees the growing rift between rich and poor, the spread ofold and the creation of new diseases, increasing starvation, decreasing literacy, increasing homelessness, decreasing health care, increasing violence and decreasing democracy as inevitable.  For pagans, man stands helpless before the Fates.  <br />Given the inhumanity of the human race and facing insurmountable problems, Kaplan urges us to \\"think the unthinkable\\". (114)  But before we follow him there, we should note that he reaches this conclusion through a series of  \\"laughers\\".  Kaplan places a great deal of emphasis on Malthus.  While Malthus deserves credit for raising issues no one else had, he was plain wrong when he theorized that prosperity would lead people to have more children.  Exactly the opposite is the case.  Prosperity, particularly when combined with women's rights, reduces population growth.  Kaplan even tries to support Malthus' incorrect theory by citing his own experiences among poor, not wealthy, populations.  Kaplan also states, citing Hobbes, that \\"altruism is unnatural\\".   Hobbes may be of interest to students of the history of political theory, but he has nothing to offer to the study of human motivation.  Kaplan might have tried to learn from psychologists, sociologists, novelists or, better yet, from his family and the aid and human rights workers he's met in his travels around the world.  He multiplies his error by suggesting that affluence leads to altruism. (96)  No.  Nor is there any evidence that abject poverty leads to altruism.  But altruism exists.  People rescued Jews from under the noses of the Nazis.  Firemen run into burning buildings every day.  Aid workers risk their lives bringing food to starving people.  Soldiers, who appear to be Kaplan's heroes, risk their lives at least sometimes for the safety and health of others.  Kaplan's view of human nature is crippled.  No wonder he wants us to think the unthinkable.<br />His solution is, apparently, the benign dictator who will, in the name of good, do all those evil and \\"realistic\\" things the good requires.   Two problems.  First, since our benign dictator is a human being and therefore as selfish, unaltruistic, power hungry and scared of death as Kaplan says we all are, we cannot trust him.  This benign dictator begins to look a lot like George W. Free the Wealthy Enron Faith-Based Bush.  At best.  The second problem is that this kind of realism is a failure.  <br />One of Kaplan's prime examples of a leader who is \\"only as brutal as circumstances required\\" (54) is Rabin.  Kaplan reports, \\"In 1988, during the Palestinian Intifada, Israel's defense minister, Yitzhak Rabin, reportedly told Israeli soldiers to \\"go in and break their bones,\\" referring to Palestinian protesters.\\"  (52)  Kaplan does not give the details.  John Conroy in \\"Unspeakable Acts, Ordinary People: The Dynamics of Torture\\" does.  The operations were brutal.  Armed soldiers dragged unarmed civilians from their homes, handcuffed them and beat them senseless, breaking arms and legs and causing other injuries.  At least one of the Israeli soldiers involved was so outraged that he reported the incident and some of those responsible were prosecuted.  What Kaplan, very much in the tradition of other realists, does not mention is that the Intifada did not end and peace did not come to the Middle East.  Nor did peace come to Iran when the CIA overthrew the elected government there in 1953, or to Guatemala when the CIA overthrew the elected government there that same year.  Nor did peace come to Vietnam when the realists decided to back the French reoccupation, or to assassinate the President we had put in power there.  Nor did peace come to Chile when the CIA realists overthrew the elected government there.  Churchill, one of Kaplan's prime heroes, was unable to cope with that naked Indian named Gandhi.  Kaplan argues that the pagan virtues are realistic virtues and that religion is ineffective and mere wishful thinking.  However, the Roman Empire is long dead and the Jews and Christians that opposed it are still here.<br />We deserve much better than Kaplan offers us.	2002-01-22

My favorite is that believers believe because they (we: okay, disclaimer time: I'm a believer six days a week and on Sundays I rest) can't face their mortality.  They feel this somehow deals with Jeremiah, Christ, Gandhi, Bonhoeffer and the Berrigans.<br />Drs. Newberg and D'Aquili's book is therefore most welcome.  Without claiming to &quot;prove&quot; or &quot;disprove&quot; the &quot;truth&quot; of belief or mystical experience, they show that mystical experiences are rooted in brain biology, that mystical experiences are &quot;real&quot; human experiences.  &quot;Why God Won't Go Away&quot; is, at first glace, a simple, reader-friendly text in which the authors invent cute names for complicated concepts.  At second glance, that is, once one discovers the footnotes, the reader realizes he has a thoughtful, well-documented and incitfull  book.  I recommend the second.<br />This is, as the authors admit, an attempt to disclose what little scientists and the rest of us know about mystical experiences.  The book left me wanting more, not only concerning the neurobiology of mysticism, but also of conventional prayer, ecstatic prayer and shamanic trances.  Do believers in conventional religion based upon obedience to precepts and authority use the brain is similar ways?  What about believers in the prophetic religions of justice?<br />The larger question, that of whether the mystical experience is the experience of a transcendent or transcendent other, remains unanswered.  Evolution, being based on chance, even if the die are somewhat loaded, can err and produce a brain fixated on worshiping its own illusions.  On the other hand, mystics may be in a position similar to that of the first amoeba to sense light.  &quot;I 'see' things,&quot; she tells her psychiatrist, &quot;before I bump into them.&quot;  The good amoeba doctor wisely prescribes a medication to rid her of such experiences.<br />Only people who are impressed by how much we know will have answers.  Those who are impressed by our ignorance will reserve judgment and keep studying and meditating.	2001-06-12

What does it mean to then turn on the TV and see some one-in-ten-million proclaim, &quot;if you can dream it, you can do it?&quot;  What does it mean when a good employer is one that will let you live in your car in the lot behind the business?<br />Some argue that it is impossible to know what life is like for anyone other than yourself.  This has the unhappy effect of leaving each of us trapped in our own little disconnected universe unable to communicate our most basic experiences or understand those of our neighbors.  Barbara Ehrenreich proves otherwise.  We can imagine.  We can understand.  We can empathize.<br />Ms. Ehrenreich lives as best she can the life of a waitress, a maid and a sales person.  She doesn't do very well.  But then, neither do her co-workers.  Employers and customers do what they can to make the employees' lives miserable.  Low pay, long hours, no benefits and no way out is a sorry existence.  Ms. Ehrenreich has a way out.  She &quot;pretends&quot; at each job for a month, but even the &quot;pretending&quot; for such a short time is a near impossible task.  Better, she understands and conveys to us the trapped, minimalized lives of her co-workers.  A maid trips and falls.  &quot;'Something snapped,' she sobs.  'I heard it snap.'&quot;  Under duress from the author, she calls the boss  - and appologizes!  And keeps working.<br />What Ehrenreich shows us is that low wage work destroys individuals, families and communities more effectively than any welfare system however maliciously designed.  <br />The ancient Egyptians developed an economic system unsurpassed at building huge temples and great pyramids.  We have developed an economic system unsurpassed at making a few individuals and a few giant organizations unimaginably wealthy and powerful.  The wealthy and powerful are our temples and pyramids.  What we have yet to do is develop an economic system which is based upon and supports the freedom, dignity, needs and willingnes to work of each individual and community.  Ms. Ehrenreich demonstrates that the mind numbing requirement that we extract every last sweat bead of profit from each transaction permits no time or resources for living a decent life.<br />Barbara Ehrenreich has done us a service.	2001-06-10

He argues that the Holocaust is not an anomaly but a warning and sign of what we, as human beings, have become.  The Holocaust would not have happened save for modern civilization.  Technological know how is important, but not the only important factor.<br />Mass atrocity requires three things: that violence be authorized by a legitimate authority, that the violent actions be routinized, and that the victims be dehumanized.  Bauman recounts the experiments of Stanley Milgram in support of his argument.  I add that, after weeks of chanting &quot;Kill, kill, kill&quot; over and over, and of hearing the &quot;enemy&quot; described as &quot;dinks&quot;, &quot;slopes&quot;, &quot;gooks&quot;, &quot;japs&quot;, &quot;women&quot;, &quot;niggers&quot; and &quot;injuns&quot;, I was able to sit through a lecture on the &quot;law of war&quot; in which my medic class was instructed that one of our jobs would be to execute wounded prisoners.  Yes, that's illegal, immoral, and something terrorists do.  Military training works.  (If you respond that &quot;war is hell&quot; and that such things are normal, think of the fuss we put up about how our prisoners are treated.)<br />Military training works because normal socialization prepares us for it.  Society, Bauman writes, silences morality.  Rather than supporting our innate morality, society replaces it, teaching us what is good and what is bad, who is good and who is bad.  It divides the world into the &quot;moral universe&quot;, relatively small, and the universe in which we are encouraged to to act with amoral abandon.  Take, for instance, the example of &quot;family values&quot;.  The moral universe cannot shrink much further.  Yes, we should obey the law, if practicable, but only until we change it to allow us to do what we want.  We certainly aren't responsible for anyone outside the family.  Family values?  Christ pointed out that even the heathen support that.<br />The answer to the social design and engineering which created the Holocaust is, Bauman suggests, unconditional responsibility.  We, each of us as a moral agent, are responsible for and to everyone regardless of whether we believe them to be good or evil.  We and they are human.  It's a tough sell, but Bauman's argument that the alternative led to the Holocaust and will lead to more similar atrocities is convincing.<br />Bauman makes his arguments without jargon, with style and passion.  This is a most important and compelling book.  If you're going to read only one book this year, make it this one.	2001-05-29

Galeano opens with a reference to Alice of Wonderland fame.  He suggests that to discover the looking-glass world she woundn't need a mirror - only a window.  I think rather, assuming Alice were a white first-worlder (as am I), that her parents would make sure the windows were replaced with massive TV screens showing only Disney pastoral scenes.  Only bad Alices actually see what is.  <br />Upside Down doesn't have the accumulated force of Memory of Fire but it does have facts and humor.  In a moment reminiscent of I.F. Stone, Galeano reports that in the January 31, 1998 edition of a Uruguayan daily, the first page congratulated the Brazilian government on selling off the national telephone company.  The second page applauded same decision for getting rid of a &quot;burden to the treasury&quot;.  Page 16 reported that the national telephone company, this &quot;burden to the treasury&quot;, had made $3.9 billion in profits for 1997.  Quite a burden to the treasury.  It's a wonder anyone bought it.  <br />No more cribbed examples, but this book will have you laughing and crying.....	2001-05-08

Blindness, the inability or refusal to see why we commit violence and to see the effects of violence on ourselves and others that continue for generations, is a kind of spiritless, hopeless and, in the end, impotent power.<br />That is one of the points of this marvelous book, a collection of articles written by anthropologists who have been through or who have been with those who have been through violence.  Not only does violence kill, main and destroy, it changes those who live after.  Violence sears identities, amputates parts of self, twisting how the survivors see themselves and others.  We are some of those others.<br />From China to South Africa to Sri Lanka to the former Yugoslavia to India to Pakistan to Nigeria to what we call Western civilization, these essays carry us around the world to meet people to have done their human best to deal with inhumane circumstances.  Sorting identities of the circumsized as opposed to the non-circumsized, trying to be a man when men have no fathers and whose primary role is to serve as targets for the enemy, the erasure of identity through steralization and the importance of memory are questions faced by the most ordinary of people.  One of the most riviting and thought-provoking essays is titled, &quot;On Not Becoming a &quot;Terrorist&quot;&quot;.  In a culture of terrorism, can a person refuse to become one - and survive?  It was a Mayan social commentator, Sam Colop, coming to terms with the decades of mass murder, who described the conqueror type.  &quot;It is not merely that his power makes him blind,&quot; he wrote, &quot;nor that his power is accompanied by blindness, nor even that his power required blindness; it is, instead, quite simply that is blindness, his willed amorality, is his power, or a large part of it.&quot;  And is it then the victims who should likewise seize power?<br />Arthur Kleinman brings it all home to &quot;the violence in middle-class life under the regieme of disordered capitalism.&quot;&quot;Rather than view violence, then, simply as a set of discrete events, which quite obviously it can also be, the perspective I am advancing seeks to unearth those entrenched processes of ordering the social world and making (or realizing) culture that themselves are forms of violence: violence that is multiple, mundane, and perhaps all the more fundamental because it is hidden or secret violence out of which images of people are shaped, experiences of groups are coerced, and agency itself is engendered.&quot;  Or, to use a &quot;mundane&quot; example, can you recall in either a movie or TV show a single non-family dispute that was resolved without violence or aggression?  Can we any longer imagine a way of solving social and political problems without violence, the threat of violence, creating new weapons, passing &quot;tougher&quot; laws, building new prisons or insisting (making) &quot;the other person&quot; make the sacrifice?  <br />A great book.	2001-05-02

She rushed out to meet him on his way home from &quot;work&quot;.  &quot;I said, 'I know what you are doing in Sobibor.  My God, how can they?  What are you doing in this?  What is your part in it?'  Her husband answered, 'Look, little one, please calm down, please.  You must believe me.  I have nothing to do with any of this.'  I said, 'How can you be there and have nothing to do with it?'  And he answered, 'My work is purely administrative ....'  'You mean you don't see it happen?' I asked.  'Oh, yes,' he answered.  'I see it.  But I don't do anything to anybody.'&quot;<br />Gitta Sereny, who may be the world's best interviewer, sat down with Franz Stangl over a long period of time while he was in prison.  She interviewed him, Frau Stangl, their friends, relatives, those who finally tracked him down after the war, and survivors of the camps.  She is above all patient.  She listens.  Stangl's story is a familiar one, and not just in Nazi Germany.  We see and hear frequently only what we want to see and hear.  We remember what is convenient to remember.  As I write this, the US press is aglow with reports and opinions regarding the story that the former Senator Kerry has admitted killing civilians in Vietnam.  Surprise and shock, as if we were hearing such a report for the first time.  As if we aren't capable of the same.  As if we are always simply doing our job, as if doing our job were a virtue and a shield against responsibility for evil.  Yes, 30,000 children die of hunger every day.  Yes, the clothes I'm wearing were manufactured by a ten year old working fourteen hour days.  Yes, my SUV is helping destroy life on earth.  Yes, what I do today is making the world unlivable for my grandchildren.  Yes, I see it.  But I'm not doing anything to anybody.<br />In the end, Stangl admits.  &quot;But I was there.  So yes, in reality I share the guilt .... Because my guilt ... my guilt ... only now in these talks ... now that I have talked about it all for the first time ....  My guilt is that I am still here.  That is my guilt.  I should have died.  That was my guilt.&quot;  He died nineteen hours later of heart failure. <br />Sereny takes us into something much like Conrad's &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot;.  But here, through her skill, there is a realization, too late and too little for Stangl and his victims.  We, however, still have time.  This may be a hopeful book.	2001-05-02

There are several fair to good essays in this book: those by Lawrence E. Harrison (introduction), Jeffrey Sachs, Ronald Inglehart, Robert B. Edgerton, Richard A. Skweder (and the responses and re-responses!), Orlando Patterson and Barbara Crossette.  <br />As the reader proceeds from one essay to the next, differences emerge, a valuable editorial choice.  Some authors argue that culture is a factor, some that it matters a lot, and some, as if grasping for a magic wand, that culture is the only game in town.<br />The first problem that emerges is that each author has his or her own idea of development.  Although Harrison in his introduction lists literacy, life expectancy, the status of women, infant mortality, democracy and human rights, most contributors limit development to economic development, and economic development to the sum total of 'things' produced or possessed.  The issue of how people in general acquire these 'things' is largely avoided.<br />The second problem is that there is a crusade to ignore history.  David Landes writes that, through observing cultural characteristics, one could have easily predicted the economic rise of West Germany, Japan, Taiwan and South Korea.  Apparently all that money we spent in those places to hold back the Soviet Union, Red China and North Korea was wasted.  They would have done it anyway.  Mariano Grondona's historical and theological analysis of the role of religions is incredibly uninformed and simplistic.  (You ought to be able to state someone else's position correctly before criticising it.)  He even claims that, &quot;Martin Luther was the religious pioneer of intellectual pluralism.&quot;  And George III was Thomas Jefferson's best friend.  <br />More general is the dismissal of the colonialism/dependency &quot;myth&quot;.  The authors believe it's fair to attribute democracy and human rights to the United States, and criticize other countries for their lack of democracy and penchant for military governments.  However, the United States overthrew or helped overthrow freely, democratically elected governments in Iran (and brought the Shah to power), Guatemala (leading to 50 years in which tens of thousands of people were massacred), the Congo (we're still living with this one), Haiti (and this), Chile, Nicaragua, El Salvador, etc. etc.  The U.S. trained and funded the militaries in Latin America about which these authors now complain.  Why don't they know this?<br />Most importantly, almost all of these authors (Barbara Crossette and Orlando Patterson excepted) treat culture as if it were timeless, monolithic and outside history.  There are subcultures, family cultures, rural cultures, city cultures, town cultures and class cultures (for a start).  Cultures change.  Cultures adapt.  Cultures are ambigous.  The most precise the writers in this book get is the distinction between North and South Italy.<br />It is good, I have learned, to ask a few questions about books like this.  Who is speaking?  Whose voice is heard?  (It's not always the speaker's.)  Whose voice isn't heard?<br />Most important here are the voices not heard.  As far as I can tell, not one of these authors grew up poor or lived with the people he (she) now wants to advise.  Sad, but not surprising.  As close as anyone comes is the mention of liberation theology, which is totally mischaracterized.  (The authors who criticized it cannot have read a liberation theologian.)  No one asks the poor what they think would help.  <br />There are excellent books for those interested in the view from the bottom: Nancy Scheper-Hughes, &quot;Death Without Weeping&quot;; Roslyn Arlin Mickelson, &quot;Children on the Streets of the Americas&quot;; Jim Yong Kim et al, &quot;Dying for Growth&quot;; and Veena Das et al, &quot;Violence and Subjectivity&quot;.  For a critique of seeing-from-above, see, James C. Scott, &quot;Seeing Like a State&quot;.<br />Most dangerous is the pervasive concept that if someone is poor, it's their fault.  Herrnstein and Murray argued in &quot;The Bell Curve&quot; that the difference was genetic.  &quot;Culture Matters&quot; is one step over.  It's still their fault, but they can change.  I am not arguing that all cultures are equal.  I am arguing that it is taking the easy way out to treat a culture as if it were not the product of centuries of internal actions and reactions, its history and geography, as well as interactions with other cultures, histories and geographies.  Blame is a slippery slope.  As one U.S. Government Agent said about Native Americans, &quot;If they cannot be made like us, they must be killed.&quot;<br />The sadest mistake of all in this book is this.  Britain did not free the American colonies.  Slave owners did not end slavery.  Corporations did not invent rising wages.  Democracy, human rights and development are the products of insurrection.  Democracy, human rights and development are the achievements of revolutionaries, radicals and union organizers.  We can join with those of other cultures who are working for these things.  We can even ask their help bringing democracy, human rights and development here, right where we live.	2001-04-22

Richard Rubenstein writes of the holocaust, why it happened, why it happened when it did, and why it may happen again and again.<br />Rubenstein writes, &quot;We are more likely to understand the holocaust if we regard it as the expression of some of the most profound tendencies of Western civilization in the twentieth century.&quot;  He locates the cause of the holocaust in modernity which he describes as a combination of secularization, disenchantment with the world and rationalization.  Secularization is the loss of religious meaning.  What is, is, and that's all it is.  Disenchantment with the world is the labeling of heaven 'good' (followed by its abolition) and the world 'evil'.  Our Bible- grounded secular society gave rise to this dicotomy in Exodus when Adam and Eve originally sinned by gaining knowledge of good and evil.  Rationalism is the irrepressible need to master the world through calculation.<br />'Ours is not to question why, ours is just to do ...'<br />Modernity laid the foundation, and bureaucracy provided the means.  Bureaucracy's roots are deep in military organization.  Both require a hierarchical structure with decisions made only at the top.  Both require layers of non-individuals who follow orders without thought or input, even if the end of the process is massive death.  We were (are) just following orders.  Just let me do my job.  Don't bother me.  Bombing cities, manufacturing cigarettes, dealing drugs, killing the earth become matters not of choice but of necessity.  To make a moral judgment - any moral judgment - is to set oneself outside society.<br />'Ours is not to question why ...'<br />Perhaps this is why Rubenstein subtitled his book, &quot;The Holocaust  and the American Future.&quot;<br />'Ours is not to question.'	2001-04-21

This is not an idle witness, a standing by, a cool, detached observance.  Forche writes in her introduction, &quot;Modernity ...is marked by a superstitious worship of oppressive force and by a concomitant reliance on oblivion.&quot;  The witness of these poets neither worships force nor accepts oblivion.  <br />The effect of reading these poems, written in the face of war, genocide, oppression, despair and racism, even reading one or two at a time as I have been doing, raises the possibility that war, genocide, oppression, despair and racism are abject failures.  Whatever their effects, they accomplish nothing.  Resistance counts for everything.  Pasternak, an included poet, described his novel in words which describe this volume: &quot;besides the importance of described human lots and historical events there is an effort ... to portray the whole sequence of facts and beings and happenings like some moving entireness, like a developing, passing by, rolling and rushing inspiration, as if reality itself had freedom and choice and was composing itself out of numberless varients and versions.&quot;<br />Men and women from every continent give lie in their poems to the sad accusation that 'human dignity' and 'human rights' are 'western' or 'american' ideas imposed on the rest of the world.  The oppressors are as likely to be 'western' and 'american' as anyone else.   The witnesses &quot;Against Forgetting&quot; are everyone.<br />Because of witness, because of resistance, hope exists.  As another poet (Muriel Rukeyser) suggests: The whole thing - waterfront, war, city, / sons, daughters, me - / Must be re-imagined, / Sunon the orange-red roof.<br />Great book.

It is not about trouble-making women, women who think they are men, or women who hate men.  It is about women.  And men.<br />Journeys by Heart by Rita Nakashima Brock, a Christian feminist, concerns power, sin, pain and freedom.  The gift of feminist theology, like the gift of liberation theology, is to crack the shell of our imagined world and allow us, for the first time, to honestly see ourselves, each other, and the reality of creation, and to enter into an honest and open relationship with God.  <br />Personally, I (as a white, male, heterosexual etc., etc.) found most interesting Brock's analysis of the culturally determined concept of power which is assigned to men.  Male identity is defined by domination and submission.  Yes, submission - not only our domination of others, but the domination of others over us.  Our male identity, wrapped up in power and control, necessarily entails that we submit to the ideology of domination; that is, for the chance to dominate others we agree to submit to God, nation, leader, class, race, the corporate ethos, rules of morality or rules of immorality.  Our identities arise from submitting to limitations imposed on us, and from the limitations we impose on others.  Everything that moves is a threat to our identity.  This we call freedom.<br />Brock leads us beyond the traditional male and female 'ideals'.  The gospels, she argues, do not lead to the question: what would Jesus do in this situation?  The gospels lead to the questions: how can I be myself, understanding that Christ lives in me and in all people? what is my relationship to God, Christ, others and all creation?  what can I do to lessen the pain and suffering we all experience in different ways?<br />This is a book of reason, heart and faith.  Men (and women) can learn quite a lot from this powerful volume.	2001-04-15

An examination of what has separated Christians and Jews may serve as a starting point for looking at what separates Jews and Palestinians, Buddhists and Hindus (Sri Lanka), Hindus and Moslems (India-Pakistan), Catholics, Orthodox and Moslims (former Yugoslavia) and other violent divisions of the human race.  (Atheists are not exempt from this fault.)<br />Constantine's Sword examines Christians and their illusions, for it was their (our - I am Catholic) sense of possession of Christ, as if we had a deed to him or he were a magic jewel, that allowed us to separate the world into 'us' and 'them', the 'saved' and those who refused to be 'saved'.  Christians turned Christ into an idol.  We felt our possession of Christ, the Truth, allowed us to use any club, the bigger the better, to subdue others.  The others, by bowing to our violence, bow, not to Christ, but to us.  And so we feel like gods.<br />We snatched slavery (our own)from the jaws of freedom.<br />Simone Weil wrote that she would not join the Church because of feat of &quot;attaching (herself) as if to an earthly country.&quot;  &quot;The children of God should not have any other country here below but the universe itself, with the totality of all the reasoning creatures it ever has contained, contains, or ever will contain.  That is the native city to which we owe our love.&quot;  We might add 'unreasoning' creatures as well.<br />Carroll's book does not fail to mention that many Christians never fell into the trap of anti-semitism.  Noe does he forget the efforts of the Pope, however obscure and minimal, to stop the holocaust.  Accusations of one-sidedness or of being anti-Catholic not only miss the point, they are grossly unfair.<br />What he gives us is the opportunity to meditate on how our beliefs, however sincere, often allow us to failto see our own evil. And, with that meditation, to become children of God.  <br />It is time to seek forgiveness: Christ's and, in particular, those we have destroyed, sometimes in his name.	2001-04-15

The intent is to convince the &quot;other&quot; to accept what Christians believe as true.  The process has always been more complicated than that.<br />As the early church converted the Greeks, Greek concepts crept into Christian theology.<br />In 1531, only ten years after the Spanish conquest of Mexico, Juan Diego, a Christianized poor indigenous peasant walking down a path, heard beautiful music and stopped.  A woman appeared to him and identified herself as the Virgin Mary.  She told him that she wanted the Archbishop to build a temple on that site.  Juan Diego dutifully set off to the Archbishop who was less than impressed.  Reporting his failure, the Virgin told him where to find roses.  When he brought her the roses, she wrapped them in Juan Diego's cloak.  Once again, he set off to see the Archbishop.  Unwrapping the cloak to free the roses revealed a picture of the Virgin.  The Archbishop relented.<br />A conversion?  Of whom?  The Virgin spoke to Juan Diego in Nahuatl, not Spanish.  The Virgin wanted her temple built not in the city where the Archbishop had planned, but where she appeared: on a sacrificial site dedicated to Tonantzin, the virgin mother of the gods.  On Juan Diego's cloak, the Virgin's dress was red, the color of the god Huitzilopopchtli.  The blue-green of the background was the color of Ometeotl, the god of natural forces.  The Virgin wore a black band around her waist, a local sign of pregnancy.<br />A simple indian peasant had captured the Virgin Mary from the Spanish, or, if you prefer, the Virgin Mary had sided with oppressed.  This appearance of the Virgin is now known as Our Lady of Guadalupe, one of her most important apparitions.<br />Was Christianity compromised or enriched?<br />&quot;The Wounded Heart of God&quot; by Andrew Sung Park describes the influence the Korean concept of &quot;han&quot; is having on Christian theology.

Benning to protest it, you could do worse than begin with this book.  <br />The SOA is a U.S. run school whose mission is to train Central and South American military in the &quot;arts&quot; of anti-communism, counter-insurgency and keeping people in their place.  The curriculum includes (along with trips to Disney World?) what we like to call (when our ememies do it) terrorism.  Not only do the course materials detail specific methods, but some graduates have admitted what they have done.  The SOA claims - after copies were leaked -that these materials have been trashed.  How reassuring. <br />The use of torture, rape and wholesale massacre by U.S. and U.S. trained troops did not begin, nor, unfortunately, will it end with the SOA, but the establishment of a school which teaches atrocity as an insrument of policy may count as one of the more grandiose fits of hubris by our government.  The SOA even recruits soldiers who already have a history of ordering or committing atrocities.  No wonder we (the U.S.) oppose the establishment of the War Crimes Tribunal.<br />Then why the three stars?  The book is too short.  No one wants to hear their government is committing evil in their name.  The proof is in the details and there just aren't enough here.  Rather than presenting paraphrases of documents and testimony, the author would have strengthened the case by more direct quotes - or even reprinting all or portions in an appendix.  We need to know which graduate of what class did what to whom when.  Much additional information is available in other books.<br />If you're new to this topic, start here.  If you want more information, search Amazon under El Salvador, Nicaragua, Honduras, Panama, Carter, Reagan, Bush, Clinton etc.	2001-04-10

But, while there are many harrowing scenes and both despicable and heroic characters, there's precious little &quot;romance&quot; in this study of prostitution and the international sex trade in Asia (Korea, Japan, Philippines, Thailand and Taiwan) and the United States.  As the authors quote one prostitute, &quot;It kind of kills you, but it's over fast.&quot;  And yet, one Thai military officer, suspected of being more than a customer, took offence at the authors' use of  the term &quot;sex industry&quot;!<br />The authors, both Christian feminists, interviewed hundreds of prostitutes and those who would provide them refuge on both sides of the Pacific, and their analysis owes much to Liberation Theology, particularly Korean minjung theology.  <br />&quot;Evil,&quot; they write, &quot;should be reconceived as whatever increases human helplessness, reinforces or inflicts pain without a healing purpose, and/or creates separation from relationships of love and nurture.  Those three things - helplessness, pain, and separation - define evil as it is experienced by those exploited by the sex industry.&quot;  It is no surprise, the authors point out, that this particular form of evil trade has taken root in and between the United States and (with the exception of Singapore) the most developed and developing countries of Eastern Asia.   &quot;The temptations of market economic theory are to reduce every aspect of human life to its value in the marketplace. .... The way in which certain economic systems contribute to human sin is to institutionalize the lack of care in a society and to make the consequences of this lack of care invisible.&quot;<br />This is an extraordinarily written, researched and thoroughly thought out work.  The authors do their humanly best to understand and have compassion for all the players in this industry.  As an introduction to how the world presently works, there may be no better book.<br />Read it.	2001-04-08

Amabelle lost her parents, drowned in the river that separates Haiti and the Dominican Republic.  A kind Dominican took her home and she was raised with the man's daughter.  Many Haitians left their country for the Dominican Republic at that time, looking for work.  (U.S. troops occupied Haiti from 1915 to 1934.)  The landowners, such as the man who took Amabelle in, needed laborers and house servants and welcomed the Haitians.<br />By 1937, however, the Haitians have become superfluous people.  It is the Depression.  The Dominican military seems unable to make up its mind: deport the Haitians or kill them?  Her lover and most of her friends arrested, Amabelle flees.  She reaches Haiti, but she is now an exile twice.<br />Danticat shows how easy it is to learn to hate, to learn to butcher and the ease with which fear seeps into the narrow spaces between people.  She also shows, in Amabelle, the possibility of remaining humane.  Amabelle's strength, love, and kindness carry her - and others - through.  <br />Years later, she returns to the Dominican Republic to visit the woman she grew up with, whom she served, whose children she delivered.  But the sad chasm of history is wide.	2001-04-06

After the American War in Vietnam, the U.S. made a strategic decision to pay the locals to do our fighting.  In other words, a proxy war.  Lieutenant Colonel Domingo Monterrosa, the crafty, spirited and charismatic officer who commanded the Salvadoran forces at El Mozote, trained in Panama at the U.S. training installation later moved to Ft. Benning, Georgia and named the School of the Americas.  Graduates of the SOA have been implicated in the murders of thousands of civilians, Archbishop Romero and American nuns and priests.<br />What I found most interesting, contrary to my previous opinion, is that the Ambassador and at least several American officials in San Salvador believed something terrible had happened in El Mozote.  Without access to the site - it had been recaptured by the FMLN rebels - they could prove nothing.  Nevertheless, they attempted to communicate their fears to Washington.  Washington decided not to believe.  Instead, the New York Times recalled one of the reporters who had been to the site at FMLN invitation and had seen the bodies.  The story seemed unbelievable.<br />The story was, of course, Communist propaganda and therefore not to be believed.  Well, yes, the FMLN did broadcast the story with the intent of influencing Salvadorans and Americans.  It was propaganda.  It was also true.<br />There is a parallel in U.S. history.  (There may be more than one.)  During the 1920's and 30's and even later, the American and European press was rife with reports of mass murders in the Soviet Union.  The press reporting these attrocities had for years been reporting and editorializing against the Soviet threat and Communist revolution, many times exaggerating or being more than a little creative.  They had also supported the American-British-French invasion of the SovietUnion after WWI.  Liberals regarded these sources as unreliable and untrustworthy, and continued to defend Stalin.  The liberals were right, of course, just as the Reagan Administration was right: the reports were propaganda.  The reports were also true.<br />Sometimes the enemy is right.  We should take care to listen.	2001-04-05

The weather set the stage, but we humans turned bad situations into horrible famines.  All it took was a little doctrinaire Adam Smith. &quot;Famine has never arisen from any other cause but the violence of government attempting, by improper means, to remedy the inconvenience of dearth.&quot;  (Quoted page 31.)<br />Mr. Davis reports that, prior to Europe assuming the White Man's Burden, the Chinese, Indians and others peoples handled drought fine.  Assuming available transportation, these pagan, medieval and incompetent governments sent food from people which had an excess to people who had none.  The drought continued until the rains came, but this little common sense kindness avoided massive starvation. <br />Europeans knew better.  In some cases, feeding starving people became a crime.  Millions upon millions starved to death while those who ruled them, enslaved by their ideology of free markets, complained about their charges' mental and physical inferiority.  And watched them die.<br />Mike Davis' point is that climate and environment matter.  They matter a lot.  The final outcome, however, depends on us.<br />So tell me again: what's this global warming thing about?	2001-04-05

He carried a shrink wrapped stack of books three feet high and tried to sell me a knock-off copy of &quot;The Sorrow of War&quot;.  When I told him I'd read it, he broke into a bright smile.  He then offered to sell me Greene's &quot;The Quiet American&quot;.  When I told him I'd read that too, his eyes sparkled, his smile stretched and he put his arm around my shoulders.  He took me to meet his friends.  He said something in Vietnamese to them.  All of a sudden I felt like I was a rediscovered lost relative.  <br />&quot;The Sorrow of War&quot; is a book that's not so much read as experienced.  There is no escaping the intensity and naked reality presented.  The author is a survivor of the American War who fought in the North Vietnamese Army, but Bao Ninh is kind to neither the North Vietnamese Army nor the Americans and its allies.  There's no romanticism in this novel, only honesty.<br />Originally banned by the Communist government, the book proved so popular that the government reconsidered and lifted the ban.  It's now a national treasure.<br />In my next life, when I'm a teacher, I will assign this to my class to be read back-to-back with Tim O'Brien's &quot;The Things They Carried&quot;.  These books could stop a war.	2001-03-29

After reading less than humble authors who are certain they have most if not all the answers, I found this volume to be a delight.  The fifteen articles in this book, each concerning individuals and groups in a particular cultural/historical setting, address the phenomenon of &quot;social suffering&quot;.  While the dominant American cultural construct holds that virtually every experience is individual, these authors establish that life is, after all, social and individual, and much suffering (another unpopular topic) is created, experienced and coped with socially.  The first chapter, by Arthur Kleinman and Joan Kleinman, is alone worth the price of the book.  After discussing how we Americans present to ourselves and react to news of dire suffering, usually discretly presented without context and with no way to respond, the authors write, &quot;The American cultural rhetoric ... is changing from the language of caring to the language of efficiency and cost ....&quot;  Other essays address Mao's China, modern India, Nazi medicine, terror in Sri Lanka and torture.  Paul Farmer's essay regarding the lives of two of Haiti's destitute is particularly unnerving.  Some of the essays require close reading, but they are well worth the effort.  This is a book that will leave you with a broader and deeper perspective.	2001-03-21
