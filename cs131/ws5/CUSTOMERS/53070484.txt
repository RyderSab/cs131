For me, the main character of Lily Snow does not come across as a woman of \\"inherent goodness.\\"  She comes across as something of an idiot who simpy sloughs through a series of major catastrophes - any one of which would most likely have killed any normal person.  There is not any one incident in this book that could be considered to have any chance of actually happening to any one person, and yet this whole series of incidents just keeps bemusing one single character in this book.  This building up of incidents irritated me to the point that I felt like I just wanted to slap Lily for thinking that she should go ahead and do any of this nonsense.  As I worked my way through the story, I couldn't quite decide if the author detests Catholics and the Catholic Church and felt that he just had to make fun of all of us, or if he was simply trying to be amusing.  Either way, I was definitely not impressed with how he went about portraying the Church and Catholics.  If the character of Sister Lily was suppose to be some sort of positive and caring character, it did not work for me.	2005-01-06

Sister Genevieve, a Daughter of Charity sister, wanted to work with the poorest of the poor.  When she was sent to teach at a school in Belfast, Northern Ireland, she didn't initially feel that this was what she felt drawn to do.  As time went by, she came to realize how depressed an area West Belfast was.  Most of the Catholic families in the area had little or nothing.  Often, what they did have was negatively influenced by the Troubles of the 1970s and 1908s.  Sister Genevieve's personal strength helped her to run St. Louise's Catholic school, and to turn it into a haven for the girls who went to school there.  The school was able to offer them a true education that they would not have been able to get anywhere else.	2004-03-25

Ohlson presents herself exactly where she is in the scheme of things, and doesn't pretend to be something she isn't.

The opening chapters held promise, but as the story went along I became particularly disappointed with the characters.  The way that they interacted, the way that they developed, the way that the plot moved around them - it all left me cold.  I expected a certain amount of &quot;negativity&quot; within the story, because it seemed appropriate.  But the ending seemed to be not only negative, but also seemed to be not much of an ending.  At least, it wasn't much of an ending for me.  I was left feeling that nothing was really resolved.	2003-11-10

And not only a history of the habit, but a history of women in religious communities through the centuries.  There is a great deal of information in the book, even though it seems to be meant as only an introduction.  Both sides of the issue regarding the wearing of the habit today are presented.  It is interesting to me that those communities that wear some sort of habit are the communities that are most likely to draw interested women.  And yet, those women who belong to communities that don't wear a habit of any kind seem so dead-set against the wearing of a habit.  Also, the book's illustrations are quite nice.  The photos are a history in and of themselves.	2003-11-04

The &quot;dark and stormy night&quot;  approach worked for<br />me in this case, and I felt myself drawn to finishing the story and<br />finding out what happened to everyone.

The professional information is most likely accurate. A listing<BR>of movies and television roles for Dean Stockwell could be found<BR>in a number of places, and then used in this book.

She is a young Liverpool woman who wants to get away from a life<BR>that she believes is leading nowhere, and thinks that being a nun<BR>will help raise her up out of her old life.  The first part of the<BR>story is actually rather interesting.  Newman does a credible job<BR>of writing, and of developing most of her characters.  Yet, I was<BR>never quite comfortable with how the main character acted and<BR>reacted to people and events.  There always seemed to be some<BR>part of her that not only did not fit in, but also did not want to<BR>fit in, at the convent.  This culminates in her having a lesbian<BR>affair with one of the other nuns.  But, perhaps even more<BR>disquieting, is the character who she has the affair with at<BR>the convent.  This woman eventually decides to leave, and<BR>sees absolutely nothing wrong with what she did -  even given<BR>that she has taken a vow of chastity, and still thinks that she<BR>might have a vocation.  I consider most of this to not only<BR>confusing, but also untruthful.  Both of these women simply saw<BR>something they wanted, and went after it with little or no<BR>thought about the consequences.  And, then, they acted as if<BR>they did not do anything wrong.  In fact, they seem to think that<BR>they are right and everyone else is wrong in this instance.<BR>Doesn't quite jive with how things are - or even should be.	2003-05-08

She wrote of her family and convent life at the request of her confessors, and gives us a close look at what life in Mexico during the late 1600s and early 1700s was like for her. These are not the translations of her complete journals - there were 12 volumes - but, rather, selections from her writings. The selections give the reader a panoramic view of Madre Maria's life. The journal entries can be a bit slow-going at times, mostly because of the writing style that Maria used. And the writing style would seem to be typical for many who wrote these types of journals. I found the section &quot;Studies of Maria de San Jose's Life and Text&quot; to be much easier to read, and somewhat more interesting. This section gives us more historical information about her life, her family, and what convent life was like at the time that Madre Maria lived.	2001-08-24

Judging by the reviews that I've read here, readers seem to either really like or really hate this particular book.  There doesn't seem to be any middle ground.<br />And my reaction to &quot;The Bonesetter's Daughter&quot;?  It may have a flaw or two, but it is still one of the best books that I have ever read.  The story and the characters drew me in from the very beginning, and held on until the very end.  I wanted to know what, when, where, how and why the story was going to progress. Not too many books do that for me these days.<br />By the end of the story I felt such emotion that I wanted to cry for these characters.  I wanted to cry because of the importance of family for all people.  What Amy Tan wrote touched me that deeply.	2001-04-24

The author tells us what happened, but also lets us know that there is a fair amount of mystery and the unknown surrounding some of what happened.  I liked the fact that Schultz told readers when there were conflicts about information, and what different sources had to say about what information was available.  And she left us with a mystery.  What DID happen to Mary Anne Moffatt?  I'd like to know - even if I found her to be overbearing and annoying.	2001-03-28

And, though reviews can sometimes lead you astray, this book is a marvelous read!  I enjoyed it from beginning to end.  To see how far Julia Garnet travels, and how much she learns during this story, moved me.  And the changes move along slowly.  You aren't battered with them.  The reader sees Miss Garnet trying to work things through, so that she can move forward as she needs to.  A wonderful character.	2001-03-22

Everyone in the story seems to be eccentric, and perhaps that's why they all fit together so well.  I enjoyed the story, and the idea of place you could vacation where you'd actually have the time to read.  The two lists of authors that one of the brothers offered intrigued me.  And a couple of the stories that were told had me laughing out loud.	2001-03-09

I enjoyed the character of Miss Dempsey, the housekeeper.  She seemed the most human to me - even with her little eccentricities.  But I was very disappointed with how the story went with Sister Philomena.  Everything in the village - including the convent - was purposely dark, but I was hoping for growth of some sort with at least some of the characters.  But the only one who seemed to grow at all was Miss Dempsey.  Other characters might have moved on, but they did not necessarily grow in the process.	2001-03-07

The introduction of one of Brenda's ex-husbands was something that piqued my interest, though I'm not sure that I can picture the character of Brenda married to a character such as Nado. But, then, who knows what sometimes draws two people together? The twist at the end of the story, and the way it all came together, was something different.  But not necessarily unusual for Brenda.	2001-02-19

Even given the time period of the story, and the fact that at that time some women who were not fit to be nuns ended up in convents, I found all of the nuns in the story to be such liars and so plainly unfit to be nuns that I felt the convent shouldn't have been left standing at the end of the story.  It didn't seem to me that there was even one woman within the story who really should have stayed in the convent.  Perhaps Lady Elizabeth and Margherita came the closest - by the end of the story - to becoming &quot;real nuns.&quot;	2001-02-13

And the message is that they must remember that each of them is going to die.  Their responses to this are interesting.  Fear. Denial.  Acceptance.  Strange, and yet moving.

I enjoyed the characters, and wanted to see where the author was going to take them.  Even given a few slower spots in the story, places where Hylton seemed to drag out things just a bit too long, I mostly felt that the story moved forward well.  Not every character moved forward, and at least one or two actually seemed to move backward.  But real life can be like that for people.	2001-01-24

I bought this book on a whim, thinking that the plot synopsis sounded interesting enough to give it a try.  I wasn't particularly expecting anything great, but was very pleasantly surprised by the story.  It grabbed my interest right from the first page, and drew me in.  The Brenda Midnight character came across as someone who was willing to go out and be herself, but was also not a character so gung-ho about doing everything that she would grate on my nerves.  Just enough of both spunk and a certain amount of worry to seem very real.  And I liked the fact that some of what happened to her -  and what caused her to be heralded as a heroine - just fell into her lap by accident.  She didn't solve everything by brilliant deduction.	2001-01-16
US	53070484	R3QXODD3J6BAW4	0380729768	507436358	Sister	Books	4	3	3	N	Y	The search for understanding and truth.	It seems to me that these two things are at the center of this book.  Abigail Schiller finally reaches the point where she wants and needs to come to grips with the tragedy of her brother's disappearance so many years ago.  Intense.  Chilling. Convincing.  Beatifully written.  I found that I had to keep reading because I kept hoping that everything would be solved in the end.  And things were mostly solved, though not necessarily happily.	2000-12-04

One of the things that I liked about Lucy Kaylin's look at this subject was how she was able to say that she thought that having grown up without religion, she was free of all preconceived notions about nuns.  And then admits that she was in for a few surprises.  The book is a bit uneven in spots, but tries to take a look at conservative nuns, radical nuns, and just about everything in between.  Kaylin tries to show the great diversity of women who are striving to live spiritual lives.  I found some of the stories more moving than others.  And some of the women came across as more - I guess you could say more appealing than others.  But, then, isn't this how it is with everyone you meet or read about?  Some speak to you, and some just annoy you.	2000-11-14
US	53070484	R2PSSUI6KPZXA7	1575665468	972919432	Face Down In The Marrow-Bone Pie	Books	4	2	2	N	Y	A surprisingly enjoyable read.	I wasn't really sure that I would like this book, but the premise of the story interested me - so I thought that I'd give it a try. The story was much more entertaining than I originally thought it would be.  I liked the character of Susanna.  She was strong and, perhaps, more willful that can be healthy, but she could also be kind to those who others would see only as servants.  I haven't yet read any of the other books in the series, but one thing I'd like to see happen is that Susanna and Robert would grow closer as husband and wife.  Having Robert traipsing around with a &quot;woman in every port&quot; sort of life, could become annoying very fast.	2000-10-19
US	53070484	RO6F0536AAG8B	0375406328	449261090	Lying Awake	Books	4	3	4	N	Y	An extremely moving story told without an overflow of...	...emotion.  The ending reminded me of so much of what I've read of St. Therese of the Child Jesus.  Towards the end of her life she was in that profound &quot;dark night of the soul&quot; that seemed to tell her that she couldn't believe in anything connected to God.  And yet she fiercely clung to Him.  And I felt that - somehow - the character of Sister John would do the same.  After all her trials and yearnings for more than she thought she had, Sister John was still willing to fight. And to believe.  And I doubt that existentialism had much, if anything, to do with this.	2000-10-19

Speaks of the changes that the Protestant Anglo-Irish began to face after the War without being demeaning - of either those Anglo-Irish or the Irish Catholics.  The characters are charming and humorous, even when they are not suppose to be perfect.  Davis-Goff's writing style is what makes this story so thoroughly enjoyable.	2000-10-11

In fact, I liked The Nun's Tale more than Robb's first two Owen Archer  mysteries.  (Actually, I sat down and re-read the first two books in the  series before I read the third one because it had been such a long time  since I had read them that I didn't really remember the stories.  I found  that I liked the first two books more this time than I did the first time I  read them.)  The Nun's Tale did such a good job of holding my interest,  that I could hardly put it down.  The history was interesting, and the  characters were believable and very strong.  The only part that I wondered  about was why the characters who were suppose to be so good at unraveling  mysteries - and seemed to be pretty discerning people - didn't catch onto  the brother/sister thing that was going on much sooner than they did.  This  was something I picked up on fairly early in the story.  And I also have to  say that I didn't really find Dame Joanna to be a very likeable character -  and, in many ways, she wasn't suppose to be very likeable.	2000-09-15

And even though Richard Jury played a much smaller part than usual, I enjoyed seeing Melrose Plant take centerstage.  I like both of these characters very much.  The other continuing characters appeared just long  enough to be entertaining without being over-powering.  The deaths of the  two children seemed so incredibly sad to me. Especially when we find out  how they really were killed.  Tragic, and a showing of the depths to which  some people can sink.	2000-07-13

The story of a family slowly falling apart, each person too caught up in the intensity of what they are feeling and trying to find for themselves to be able to really help or comfort each other.  And it seems as if Eliza  loses something so joyful. Her joy in words and letters becomes so caught  up in what her father thinks that she should be trying to do with her  talent, those words and letters no longer speak to her.  Beautifully  written story that draws you into the lives of the characters.	2000-07-10

A story that works out the characters' problems in due course without forcing actions on them.  And it was sheer pleasure to read a book set in Ireland that didn't make everyone  in it out to be dark, dirty, horrible, mean, or viscious.  Too many of such  books that I've read - whether fiction or nonfiction - seem to want all of  the Irish, especially the clergy and religious, to be nothing but bad news.	2000-06-27

The author's first attempt to enter a convent struck me as a romantic leap that was not thought out at all.  It was almost as if she just woke up one morning and decided this is what she should do, whether it was right for  her or not.  Her second attempt came across much better.  This time she  tried to think things out, and seemed to be honestly trying to find out if  the convent was where she belonged.  There were moments that were very  amusing, moments that were very trying, and moments when I wondered how she  managed to last as long as she did in the religious life.	2000-06-27

I had never heard of the book or the author, but was intrigued by anyone being a &quot;gentle murderer.&quot; And with this story, the reader knows who the murderer is from the very beginning.  But I found myself quite  caught up in following those who don't know who he is.  The first person  looking for the killer is the priest who tried to help him in the  confessional.  Father Duffy hopes that the killer will go to the police,  but soon realizes that this isn't going to happen.  So he begins his search  for the man who reminded him of pictures of St. Francis.  And when the  murder is discovered, the police are soon also looking for this unknown  killer.  Sergeant Ben Goldsmith begins his search.  The question becomes,  can either the priest or the police find the killer before there is a risk  that he might kill again? As the search continues, Duffy and Goldsmith's  paths cross.  And they both know how important it is to find this killer.	2000-03-22

The bit of a twist that made an accident appear to be murder worked for me.  It made me think, 'Okay, this main character is on the edge of bragging about helping to solve murders in England, feels a bit put-out  because the Scottish police don't seem to want her help, and then realizes  that she might have made a mistake - and she wants to correct it.&quot;   It's nice to see a main character who is not only NOT perfect, but is made  to face how she might have hurt someone by her mistake.  She doesn't have  to see and solve everything on her own.	2000-02-18

I really enjoyed the first two mysteries in this series, and this one was even better than the those two.  This makes two &quot;old&quot; mysteries that Christine Bennett solves, but I like how she digs down and works at  finding the facts she needs.  I also like the fact that this character can  hold onto the good parts of the life she led as a nun. And that she still  feels close to the sisters she lived with for so many years.  Again,  Christine Bennett comes across as intelligent and caring.	2000-02-07

Lee Harris has done a decent job of creating a character that is not only an amateur sleuth, but an ex-nun.  Christine Bennett comes across as a balanced person who has decided to make a major change in her life, and takes the time to try to slowly learn a new way to live.  And she just  happens to get caught up in murders and mysteries along the way.  And this  story involves everything from people who escaped Nazi Germany to rare  books that are worth large sums of money.  The only part of the story that  I didn't care quite so much for was how easily the ex-nun seemed to decide  it was time to fall into bed with someone she liked.  Especially after she  had earlier said something about how she didn't want this sort of thing to  be tied up with the reasons why she left the convent. She had other  reasons.  I felt that this situation was rushed, and it did feel like the  character simply &quot;fell&quot; into it.  Almost as if the whole thing  was just expected, and would happen anyway, so why not now?  Didn't sit  well with me.	2000-01-28

I wasn't sure if I liked it at first, and almost gave up on it.  Instead I kept at it, and once I was past the first couple of chapters or so I found that I began to enjoy the story.  I became interested enough in the  characters to want to know what was going to happen to them.  And  interested enough to want to follow the story to see where it was going.  I  didn't, perhaps, enjoy it quite as much as some of the Tony Hillerman  books, but the series does have some very positive possibilities.	2000-01-18

I've never read any of Connie Wllis' Christmas stories before I bought this book.  In fact, the only other book of hers that I have read is &quot;To Say Nothing of the Dog.&quot;  I enjoyed that so much that I  thought I might enjoy &quot;Miracle and Other Christmas Stories.&quot;  And  I did.  Immensely!  I particularly liked &quot;Miracle&quot; and  &quot;Newsletter.&quot;  If only I could write a newsletter as off-the-wall  as the one in this book!  Of course, as soon as I read the term &quot;pod  people&quot; - and knew exactly what the author was talking about - I began  to wonder if I've seen one two many science fiction movies. And she also  just happened to have placed three of my favorite Christmas movies on her  list.  Talk about good taste.	2000-01-11

I was really looking forward to reading the book, but I have to say, though, that I did not particularly enjoy it.  I was, in fact, very disappointed in the story and the way that it was written.  For me, one of  the problems with the story is that it seemed so hard to follow.  One of  the things that I found irritating was an over-abundance of going back and  forth between what was suppose to be the past and the present, with little  or no easy transition between the two. Even given the fact that the story  was told from the view-point of a child, this just did not work for me.	1999-12-06

I was not sure if I would enjoy this book or not since I knew that it was about women who had left convent life.  I found some of the stories to be very moving, but some of them made me feel rather sad.  And some of the  stories really made me wonder about where the individual writers were  coming from because those stories seemed a bit off the wall.  The book did  show me that there certainly is a wide variety of personalities both in and  out of the convent!	1999-11-18
