But I will warn you that this book is readable and very approachable for the undergraduates.  That is part of what makes it so good.  This is not just for professional academics.  I think it succeeds admirably in what it wants to do.  And even if cultural biology is a viable field of endeavor that supplants evolutionary psychology, its need to make factors other than human nature look primary will always be suspect -- and rightfully so.	2003-12-15

I found that it was frequently quite interestingly focused on the way in which white nationalists have appropriated the style of thinking common to postmodernism.  An appeal to pity for suffering white kids, an appeal for special consideration under the law to remedy the suffering of Christian normals at the hands of a liberal elite.<br />What could be more chilling than that?	2003-12-15

He looks at some things you might not associate with the sociology of knowledge, but only so as to talk about the aspects relevant to his theme.  <BR>His theme is that the sociology of knowledge simply does not work.  <BR>This book is probably the most thorough available refutation of Bloor, Latour, The Strong Programme and what not.  Nola resists distraction and organizes his material effectively.  He clearly labels each proposition of his opponent's arguments.  And the thread of what he is saying is never lost.  <BR>Beyond the sociology of knowledge proper, there are admirable chapters on Wittgenstein, Marx, Foucault and Nietzsche.  In each of these cases, Nola's focus is on the aspects of these thinkers that either do help, or might be construed as helping the delusions of the sociology of knowledge crowd.  Each of these are clear and well structured.<BR>The Nietzsche chapter is in fact one of the clearest things about him in English today.  It ranks alongside May, Leiter, Schacht, Clark and other work on Nietzsche from competent analytic philosophers.  One might not associate Nietzsche with social means of explanation in the philosophy of science and logic.  However, there are a few passages that postmodernists and others have used to this end.  Nola shows that if those arguments they ascribe to Nietzsche were in fact his or not, they are inconsistent or worthless for some other reason.  So, while I have always figured Nietzsche to put psychology ahead of sociology just to begin with, I still find Nola's treatment of these corners of theory most helpful.  Also of interest to the Nietzsche scholar is Nola's more general treatment of Nietzsche's philosophy of logic, of his genealogical thought, and of his thinking on 'the asceticism of truth.' <BR>Highly recommended.	2003-12-15
US	49593611	R322ZBXUXLKPSR	0195160142	713496812	Living with Nietzsche: What the Great "Immoralist" Has to Teach Us	Books	2	14	21	N	N	Sloppy and inaccurate	The reviewers here seem to be getting things right. There is a liveliness to Solomon's prose, and it can be informative, and Solomon does bring up important stuff, as reviewer Schroeder says.  It is also true, as reviewers Wiz and Meister say, that Solomon achieves this by being breezy, light, sometimes incoherent, and always rather touchy feely.    I find that the book has barely a hint of structure to it.  What it has it gets from Solomon's ramblings about ad hominem fallacies in Nietzsche.  These remarks fill out the first chapter of the book, but they are talked about and hinted at in the introduction and elsewhere. Solomon has published these ideas about Nietzsche and ad hominem fallacies elsewhere.  They appear highly convoluted and specious to me.   Solomon has spent his entire career writing about virtue, and, predictably, the chapter on his specialty is the strongest one.    In response to reviewer Schroeder I will just say that Nietzsche never held that \\"resentment is always a corrupt motive\\" and so Solomon's criticism of Nietzsche on this front is a straw man. The same point is made by Dr. May in the book called Nietzsche's Ethics and His War on Morality.    Clearly the weakest part of the book is its confusion of ad hominem fallacies with things that are non-fallacious, such as reasoning about human motives and about human psychology.  There seems to be no good reason for Solomon to use the term ad hominem on many occasions where he does so.  It is as though he wants to have an important idea about logic, but his big idea amounts to calling psychological explanation ad hominem.  Explanations are not even arguments, so there can be no fallacy in them.	2003-08-08

Golomb was right that there was a 'lacuna' in Nietzschean studies involving the study of Nietzsche's psychology, and his relationship to Freud.  That would have been enough for a book.  But Golomb also has the issue of Heidegger to introduce all over the place.  As a result, this book becomes a Heideggerization of Freud and with him, Nietzsche.      If you want to learn about Nietzsche, you don't want to read this.  There are a couple of interesting enough chapters about the early development of Nietzsche's psychological thought.

But that is all, and the point at which its incompetence is best revealed is the conclusion.  Just before that, however, Nye tells us that Frege was insane.  Then she reaches the stellar conclusion that 'logic is insane', which seems to be her most famous thesis.  It is bought through dramatics alone.  The very thesis is a fallacy: it ascribes human pathos to inanimate or to abstract things.  'Logic is insane' is like saying that 'mathematics has a fireplace at home,' or that 'the pythagorean theorem was once a fish in a frying pan.' The other reviewer here constantly personifies abstractions, just like like Derrida and Nye.<br />Right near the start of her very short concluding chapter, Nye admits that she has employed ad hominem and genetic fallacies throughlut the book.  She then tries to justify their use.  Do not read the book until you fully understand her argument there.<br /> This book is a museum piece.  It is an example of the genre of the contracted book, in which the author promises to bring particular prejudices to bear on things that withstand all prejudice.  There is nothing feminist to say about logic, only about logicians and other actually political or moral things, becasue feminism is a moral or a political docrtrine, not a theory of logic.  There is nothing feminism can do about the primeness of three and the non-primeness of four.  Their moral and political categories are not suited for the assessment of abstractions like the primeness of three.  they are also unsuited to the assessment of the law of noncontradiction.<br />On the last page before the conclusion, Nye admits that she is not a logician.  She meant to say, not much of one.	2003-07-09

All who are tired of the new intellectual orthodoxy can acquire a trove of swift and mighty swords if they will master this book.  There are weapons and armor of every shape and size here, something for about any fight one may join in the swamps of postmodernism. <br />Devaney takes on the entire rhetoric involved in calling logic binary. She devastates the typical Hegelian errors PoMo theorists make about the law of noncontradiction. Her prose is lucid and swift. The book is of appropriate length, i.e, not too long, I would say. I did want more. I have seen no other book of work like this from a competent logician. <br />Devaney is very fair minded. For example, she separates Derrida from the pack who moralize the young over the bogey of 'binary logic' and 'binary thinking' and 'binary' everything else. That discussion is most valuable for anyone up against it in a hall full of irrationalists. Their paradoxes and stuff are usually just confusions. The chapter on the politics of the Logic of Both/And is superb. Derrida says all kinds of irresponsible stuff, and those who support him just moralize and politicize. Devaney has it that the myth of the 'Logic of Both/And' -- which is alleged to be true only when the law of non-contradiction is false--is not really Derrida's. It is a gift to Derrida from his followers -- the underlings made it up in his name. <br />Those who master this whole book will have a field day in the battle against the swelled and bloated croakers in the backwaters of the hatred of logic and science. So far as I know, this is the best logician's handbook against the current nonsense in existence.  As a tour of the madhouse where logic is postmodernized, it is unsurpassed as well.	2003-07-09

If you would like to see where this discussion reaches the point of its competence, read the discussion of the law of non-contradiction at the end.  This book is mainly a discussion of the history of logic.  At the end however, the author is discussing the law of noncontradiction as though it denied that independent propositions could both be true.  The law only asserts that a statement and its denial cannot both be true.  The discussion of Wittgenstein seems a lot like that of Andrea Nye, in 'Words of Power: A Feminist Reading of the History of Logic.'  Both think that genetic fallacies about logic are interesting and profound.  Nye even argued for that in the conclusion of her book.  Evans does not entertain us with such hopelessly wrongheaded chatter.  But he is not always getting his logic right.  The prose is readable, and one can learn about the history of logic from this book, and see the presentation, and so on.  But one should not trust all of the formulations that you find here, and beware the political and psychiatric talk.  The presentation is that of a gay male, which is in some sense the sole reason for this book's existence.	2003-07-09

Many out of control discussions are on hand, eventuating in nothing worth remembering.  The idea of this book seems to be to reinforce the idea that morality is boring, that no one should find thinking about morality interesting, and that if you just call boring prose dangerous, then it is.  The argument in this book goes all the way back to Paul Valery, Derrida's inspiration, who misunderstood Saussure.  Valery argues that philosophy has all the marks of literature, and so is indistinguishable from it, and so just is more literature -- no different from comic books, grafitti and wedding vows.  But Quine found no marks of science that were not to be found in philosophy, yet philosophy does not reduce to science.  The argument is no better from the side of art.  Philosophy does not reduce to art.  Valery was wrong, and so is the Magnus group.	2003-07-08

Rossett is by far the most Nietzschean of the French philosophers, and is hated by the vast majority of them for pointing out that Foucault, Irigaray, Derrida and the rest really do not know Nietzsche at all. For Rossett, PoMo is a kind of cruelty. It is based on hating reality -- the only true source of scandal. Affirmative philosophies, like those of Nietzsche, Spinoza and Empedocles, are simply not allowable. To like life and reality is not allowable. It is unsporting to be an atheist. It is unsporting to find reality acceptable and to force the complainers to defend their devaluation of the now. The complainers and the irrationalists never have to defend themselves.  Why is that?  They are following their cruelty, and we rationalists resist ours.  A must read.	2003-07-08

However, the characters reviewed are all postmodernists.  Schrift is utterly tolerant of the lunacy most of them write.  In fact, Schrift is one of the postmodernizers of Nietzsche.  He wants Nietzsche to worship at the feet of Derrida along with himself.  Schrift does not review, for example, Alain Finkielkraut, who is more popular in France than any of the PoMo big shots, and who does not share their opinion of Nietzsche.  He ignores Julien Benda as well.  And he never mentions Clement Rossett -- who had the temerity to point out that the entire movement claims to be Nietzschean, when nothing could be further from the truth.

It is based on a couple dozen short snippets of Nietzsche's work that Conway uses over and over again.  The rest of what the other reviewer who gave it only one star said is correct.  The whole point of Conway's book is to say that Nietzsche was vain, wanted nothing more than to control his followers, and that his readers are all fools -- which must surely include Conway.  Conway is a postmodernist whose prose is mostly unreadable.  His political orientation is Hegelian.  But Nietzsche was free of the Hegelian nonsense.  Conway rejects the individual.  But the individual is the central concept of Nietzsche's political thought.  Conway believes in totalitarianism, like Marx.  He has no faith in people, only in groups and their leaders.  Conway wants the PoMo future: utter ignorance and strong arm leaders who are allegedly benevolent because they have been freed of the fetters of law and existing contracts.  Conway thinks Nietzsche is an irrationalist, but Nietzsche ridiculed irrationalism throughout his career.  Conway and his postmodern moralist cohorts believe 'it is a sin against everything of value to become scientific' to cite just one bit of Nietzsche's mockery that fits the PoMo mind frame (CW Postscript 1).  This book is worth almost no one's time, and all students should avoid it.	2003-07-08

But Nietzsche is not one of those types.  Indeed, 'there is nothing outside the text' is one of those pieces of philosophical insanity that can only be compared to other such pieces: like Parmenides belief that nothing moves, or Barkeley's belief that there is no such thing as matter, or Palto's belief that things do not have their properties, or Kant's belief that because we have categories we cannot know, and so on.    Nehamas and postmodernism are outgrowths of German Idealism.  Nietzsche rejected that school.  Almost everything he fought he called 'idealism' at one point or another in hiw career.  He thought of German philosophy as a flight from reality, and a coward's philosophy designed to make a big show and distract everyone from how paltry and small minded one's German soul really was.  The very notion of life as literature is self-contradictory.  But, of course, like all postmodern theorists, Nehamas is un-selfcritical.  His rectitude is all that matters.  Like all postmodernists, he demands that we sacrifice our knowledge in order to accept an absurdity.  His absurdity: that a pretend Nietzsche is of the same value as the real Nietzsche -- that imaginary and real are equal.	2003-07-08

Women and feminism are the objects and sources of impossible moralities, impossible burdens and impossible logic. That has been observed before, and many have noted that feminism is ever the more central to all things today, especially political correctness. However, I know of no other sustained discussion of these and related ideas. Schwartz's final chapter on feminism is a page turner. His implication that all hope now rides with woman, along with his diagnosis of political correctness as infantile narcissistic attachment to the mother are exceptionally worth thinking about these days. Schwartz uses very interesting examples at times, especially in his analysis of the attempt to feminize and PC-ise the workplace, also in his analysis of the controversy over women in combat--a study of the irrational that is based on statements from our highest level military and state officials. One has a lot to chew on after seeing how PC logic, which is the logic of the ad hominem argument, is winning the day on this issue. ...	2002-12-13

Of the over forty titles I have read on contemporary punitive moralism, this one is by far the liveliest-in fact, the book is downright exciting.

She likes to talk about how the punitive rectitude we have all internalized works-how we all know it works, even though we think we don't, indeed, even though we think we are thoroughly fighting it. For this touch, and for the effort it took to write a cheerful style in spite of the personal danger incurred by stirring up the ever more creepy 60's moralizers, this book deserves an award.

This book will not answer exactly that question, but it will open your eyes to the incredible extent to which Americans have lost all sense for when it is appropriate and when it is inappropriate to meddle into the affairs of others. We have weather meddlers announcing every little storm to us on the evening news and reminding us to button up when the cold snaps start. We have a meddlesome health and nutrition racket that is official information on the evening news every day and an emotional testament in the mail every week. There is almost nothing to eat if you are too weak willed to resist the food moralizing industry. We have education moralizers in greater number than we have teachers. We have so many meddlers in the education game that education has become all but impossible. Then there are the meddling attorneys who see every misfortunate experience as the violation of some kind of right to pleasant times, or at any rate as an opportunity to meddle with the laws by testing and straining at them and the sanity of juries together. <br />This book is welcome relief. The subject matter is of extreme importance. Plato and Aristotle are in agreement that a portion of the state must meddle into the affairs of its citizens. There is no doubt, as the authors point out, that there is virtuous meddling. But there is also a point at which meddling is a vice. There can be no doubt about that either.<BR>In one chapter, the authors look at the ideologies of meddling. I found this valuable. They show that the so called right and left in politics is a terribly specious distinction in the understanding of cultural affairs. Meddling ideologies are shared by most sides in all affairs of state in America today. Even the libertarians are not above meddlesome intent. The work is well done. It deserves five stars for its subject matter and writing alone. But it is a book on the right topic at the right time. For that it deserves an extra award for timeliness and pertinence. The chapters outlining the types of meddlers and their means of self-promotion and self-justification are simply engrossing.	2001-09-02

Savor it.  David Stove not only talks about philosophy, even our precious analytic philosophy, with wit and derision, he actually does philosophy, and excellent analytic philosophy, in a lively and unforgettable style. This is an excellent book for students because it is humorous and very lively, but it also achieves and sustains levels of clarity rarely seen in discussions of solipsism, idealism, Kantian questions and a host of other 'problems.' Graduate students in every humane field can learn a great deal of philosophy from Stove, and students of philosophy have in this book a new model of excellence.     His style is humorous, aggressive and precise, while also being very gracious and conciliatory though never merciful enough to give up his belief that he is right after all. Stove is the most combative philosopher, both in style and substance, that I have come across in quite some time.  He believes that it is a myth that philosophy is largely based on arguments. He holds, in fact, that most philosophers, including the most famous ones, argue far too little.  Stove argues a lot.  Perhaps to make up for all the lost time...    If there has been a consistent strain to the negative remarks about Stove, it is probably that his style is not sanctimonious, or respectful or unctious enough to please the hotly moralistic puppy ears of our hypersenstive age. For example, Stove concludes that the world of Objective Idealism is merely the regular world spoken of in church and pulpit tones. He lampoons Nozick as having a make believe philosophy.  And there are other disrespectful things said. However, Stove is not engaged in any personal attacks. He has the goods on everyone he talks about, and he restricts his concerns to their arguments. He does not make fun of anyone, I would say.  It is more like he has fun while talking about the zany arguments philosophers fall for.      The main point of the book seems to be to take idealism down a notch or two.  A century and a half of idealism needs diagnosis, and not all diagnoses are flattering. Some are even offensive to morally feverish puppies.    And then there is the lingering guilt over positivism. Our age enjoys a guilt and punishment game played out over the graves of every positivist aspiration. If the most rational diagnosis of the scene at the death of positivism includes a recommendation that the patient be revived, walked about and exercised back into robust health (sans a few toes and some pride), then it is just too bad for those planning the funeral. Stove's Neo-Positivist Credo (the final chapter) is a very real threat to every obscurantist in the humanities.

For those of us tired out by the moralistic kulturkritiks on kampus, a little jostling of their heroic 'science studies' vanguard is most welcome and invigorating. What has been most amazing to me is the number of characters who have tried to rescue the editors at Social Text. There are characters here saying that it is dangerous for physicists to pronounce on the nature of science (even on the nature of physics) precisely because they are physicists! They actually print these kinds of fallacies in some places. <br />The editors of Lingua Franca have been most kind to our palates. They have included the old hippies with their hysteria and conspiracism right along with the sarcastic, the wise and the profound. The numerous newspaper stories about the hoax are a little tiresome, but the sheer number of them, from all around the world, gives the reader some sense of the world wide significance of what is at stake in the \\"science wars.\\" You will not be sorry if you buy this. Barbara Epstein's essay on \\"Postmodernism and the Left\\" is worth the price of the book. The other essays are quite helpful as well. I have not seen another book of exchanges between pomos and other thinkers. It is remarkable at times how the pomos just go right on committing their fallacies and using their rhetoric, even after some other person has just pointed out the fallacy or exploded the rhetoric in question. The book reaffirmed my belief that most of us are not pomos at all. Rather, there are very few. In fact, it is difficult to be one, since you have to get used to thinking without evidence, and to arguing with nothing to support you except your strong conviction. Until they have some evidence, the science studies crowd will remain a laughing stock.	2001-04-19

There is an opening section concentrating on Sokal's Hoax, with Sokal and others commenting on the affair. Gross and Levit, of Higher Superstition fame, log in with contributions that are well worth reading. There are essays addressing the Strong Programme, and discussions of Hobbes and the Airpump. Only three papers become very technical. A couple more are somewhat difficult. Meera Nanda's account of how radical science critique is playing out in the third world is excellent and chilling. The postmodernists have strengthened the hand of repressive regimes who reject science as western rationalism, and then set out to fashion an Islamic science or a Hindu arithmetic, etc. Nanda has case studies to back her up. Koertge contributed a nice paper on scientific literacy. Levit's attack on the central dogmas of science studies is quite a punch.  I enjoyed every minute of this collection and we need more essays like these.	2001-03-25

The book is quite lucid and clear, with numbered sections and subsections, and occasionally numbered paragraphs--like a work from Wittgenstein.  The numbers facilitate recall and research as well as May's presentation.  <br />The author holds, in short, that Nietzsche can only be at war with one strain of morality, not moral life per se, nor moral judgment, nor moral thought in toto.  This is the strain that Nietzsche called 'the morality that would unself man.'  It is variously said to be dacadence ethics, resentment ethics, ascetic morality, life-denying ethics and so on.  May organizes the various remarks and sorts the kinds of ethics under discussion.  He asks clear questions about the categories in question, and is anxious to point out that Nietzsche in no way rejects things ad hominem or via the genetic fallacy.  He does not reject, say, a belief because it is born of envy, or resentment, or etc.  His judgment is against only certain employments of resentment, and even against only certain functions life denial has come to fill.  As such, May's Nietzsche practices a far more nuanced form of moral judgment than most authors have assigned him.  <br />The final quarter of the work deals with the question of the value of truth, which is surely Nietzsche's most characteristic question.  May's Nietzsche comes off as entirely resistant to postmodernist hubris over the surprisingly low value they assign to truth.  Nietzsche assigns truth a very high value, especially for those who have responsibilities.  Honesty, which Nietzsche calls the youngest of the virtues, is, of course, the characteristic modern cruelty, and a cruelty whose value Nietzsche promotes and whose presuppostion, truth, Nietzsche must also value.  <br />May has done us all quite a favor by rendering certain contours of Nietzsche's moral thought so clearly.  A must read for serious students.	2001-03-25

It reviews all forms of counter-enlightenment zealotry individually: the postmodernists, the romantics, the zoologists of humanity, the cognitive machine theories of humanity, and so on.  Tallis is a very sensitive man who has gone to a great deal of effort to understand the arguments of the opponents of rationalism and science.  He has good credentials too, since he is an MD who has published an awful lot of articles in his field, gerontology.  He is British, to boot, so he writes well and with wit.  I know of no other complete review of the counter-enlightenment goofs under a single cover.  In addition, Tallis is careful to extract the Scottish from the French enlightenment, where the French is the strand with the excessive moral zeal that wanted to perfect all nations into models of the French, which is the chief thorn making the counter-enlightenment crowd angry.  If you take the social activism element out of the enlightenment, you are left with only the scientific element, and the charge that the enlightenment was an attempt at cultural hegemony is ludicrous.  The final chapter is a defense of the enlightenment that is careful, strenuous and clear eyed.  This book is excellent reading, and a very nice contribution to the central debate of our times.	2001-03-08

His Nietzsche is an irrationalist with no contributions to knowledge or philosophy worth remembering. The book is tiresome and the prose tends toward moralism, pedantry and saccarine pride at being a postmodern moralizer. The industry review supplied here at Amazon is innacurate: the chapters are on Birth of Tragedy, The Gay Science, Zarathustra and the Genealogy of Morals ONLY! There is no chapter on Beyond Good and Evil, not on The Antichrist, nor on Twilight of the Idols, nor on the autobiography. I disagree that Allison has covered the principal works since he ignores so many of them.<br />If you want another Heideggerian-Derridian \\"reading\\" that is more about living people than about Nietzsche, then maybe this is for you. But if you want to learn about Nietzsche's ideas and what he means for the real life of the mind today, this book will not assist you.	2001-03-08

Berlinerblau has done a convincing job of being fair to all sides, and he does not appear to admire any of the people he writes about.  This book says a lot about the way scholars look at one another these days, and the lessons he brings are useful in considering any number of entrenched disputes in the academy today.  In the end, the book has a rather depressing message: moral zealots are in charge on both sides of so called 'ideological warfare' today, and neither side is prepared to doubt their right to lie.  The book can be dry, but the kind of thing under discussion has no finer demonstration in any work I have read.  Luckily, the topic, Bernal's BLACK ATHENA, is a very curious case, especially since Bernal is a white man.  Some parts of this are engrossing.	2001-03-08

The main effort is in disentangling the moral intimidation of science from the actual aims and goals of science, especially in psychology and the social sciences.  There is a good opening chapter on psychology, Dr. Kendler's field, and from there many social issues are taken up, and the moralistic chaff is separated from the scientific wheat in most cases.  IQ tests, affirmative action, the nature/nurture controversy and the anti-scientific animus are just a few of the topics under the microscope.  The book is clear and very brief in places, but makes for very good reading.  He also has excellent sources.  Highly recommended.	2001-03-08

It covers numerous different attempts to found radical egalitarian communities, charting some very telling failures and stupidities that they ran into. It sports a devastating final chapter on the evil intent in the demand for more equality than it is reasonable to assume we could ever bring into being. The demand for ever more equality is a self-promotion, it is a vain strut, a moral pose that makes one important, ups your status. The radical moralizer is a wanna-be priest.	2000-10-25

I finally read this and liked it a great deal.<br />The central idea is that \\"radical multiculturalism\\" is distinguishable from what is known as critical legal studies, and that an inherently racist set of assumptions forms the core of radical multiculturalism. <br />Since the radical multiculturalist rejects appeals to the concept of merit (or just dessert), he or she cannot use that concept in an explanation of the disproportional success of Jews and Asians in the alleged white gentile male conspiracy that is the Western world in the eyes of all the alleged kulturexperts on kampus. Jews are overrepresented on law faculties, in the sciences, in the arts and so on, including hollywood and broadway. Asians are far more likely than whites to attend college, as are Jews, and so on. (The numbers involved here are well known and uncontroversial for the most part.) Since the radical multiculturalist holds that it is not merit that gets people where they are in the world, they seem to believe that Jews and Asians, like whites, do not deserve the success that they have enjoyed. In order to explain that unearned (unmerited) success, the multicultie critic can appeal either to:<br />A) Jews and Asians are highly successful manipulators of an unethical system (of the white male conspiracy), or <br />B) Jews and Asians are successful due to their own unethical systems (conspiracies) to promote themselves and their own power. <br />Both explanations open to the radical multicultie are prima facie racist, prima facie anti-Semitic, prima-facie slanderous of Asian people.<br />This is the heart of the book, the main charge against radical multicultie. The authors are interested in a larger point of view, however, including the rejection of truth and the rejection of objectivity in radical legal scholarship. Most interesting and weird of the highlights of this work are the authors' reports and commentaries on the new law review fashion of publishing stories. These first person narratives are alleged to teach a great deal more about the law than abstract legal reasoning 'ever could'--so plea the race romantics. Farber and Sherry have a field day with this nonsense. <br />I found the final chapter, anatomy of an ideology, very valuable. It is surely the most succinct statement of the way that American radicalism works that I have ever seen. All by itself, this chapter is worth the cost of the book. The fact that you get the long and extensive analysis of the racism inherent in multicultie makes this book money very well spent on a sizable amount of material that, due to its rational (not merely fashionable) nature, will never lose value. The arguments discussed vis a vis education in law, transfer immediately to other fields, that is, the point of view that Farber and Sherry have taken, and the tactics they use to undermine their opponents' views, are in no way limited to legal studies or legal practice. The entire book is transferable almost verbatim to disputes in English departments, in Business and so on. Radical multicultie is racism, and there should be no surprise in that, since it is the result of the caving in of the intellect to pity and moral tyrrany--that is to say, the american doctrine of identity politics developed in the wake of the general university policy of accomodating and making concessions to ignorance, envy, vanity, and even racist sentiments, as long as they were 'authentic' sentiments from \\"authetically pityable\\" classes. It is the result of these concessions, and as doctrine, amounts to special pleading for the allowableness of some forms of vileness, but not others. Ultimately, it is a policy sculpted to not demand non-racist attitudes from race baiters and other 'good racists'--. That kind of racism is good, and we need more of it, thinks the official radicalism on campus today.	2000-10-25

The entire book is well documented and nicely written. Sommers wisely leaves the misandry of gender feminism unanalysed as it would only clutter the book. But she takes on the misleading claims of the politicizers of classrooms and wins the argument with embarrassing ease. The case can be far more strongly put. I have been teaching logic for fifteen years. Almost every term a female (and usually a handful of them) leads the class in points earned for solving problems correctly. It has been very rare that a male does so. The feminist notion that logic is an evil, male enterprise designed to hurt ladies is a total fraud. Sommers is to be appreciated as one of the more significant truth tellers of our times. She has spoken truth to power. This book is popularly written and a real page turner. Bravo, Ms. Sommers!	2000-09-19

It makes for good reading too. Pearson's main point is that crime won't be well understood until the myth of female innocence is depotentiated. Excellent chapters on female criminality including women who give birth and then kill, women who kill their children later, women who kill family members, nurses who kill, predatory women, women who batter their (male or female) mates, female serial killers, and so on. Excellent accounts of how women use their femininity to avoid prosecution, or to become the preferred perpetrator, who gets first shot at copping for a lesser charge. <br />There is a later edition of this book with the subtitle: How women get away with murder, or something close to that.  I have no idea how different the two books are.	2000-08-08

It forms little in the way of an introduction to Nietzsche, because there are almost no citations from Nietzsche in it. The authors do a small service inadequately when they try to refute thirty rumors about Nietzsche--like that he was crazy or a postmodernist or an anti-Semite. Many of these thirty topics are too briefly addressed.      The authors write repeatedly and approvingly of Nietzsche's (alleged) use of ad hominem fallacies. They claim that he \\"relishes\\" the ad hominem argument (p. 64), which is nonsense, as Nietzsche was far too proud and too smart to resort to such a maneuver. They write that the ad hominem fallacy can be \\"a very good test of a view\\" (p 24).  This is nonsense, since arguments are not tests.  The authors also believe that if someone is sick and entertaining pessimistic views, that their sickness is grounds to discount the truth of the view in question (again, p. 64), which is simply insultingly stupid of them to say and a danger to all students. Solomon and Higgins even write a whole, 50 page chapter called \\"Nietzsche ad hominem\\" in which they list Nietzsche's 'top ten' figures from history along with his 'bottom ten'. This exercise in reducing Nietzsche's thought to the level of an internet rant is followed by an appendix that wants to be a dictionary of Nietzschean terms. It is no such thing, since it leaves out so many of the obvious terms, like the free spirit, to instead define terms like camel, lion and snake. The two idealists behind this manual for the nanny-culture want Nietzsche to serve as religious-moral symbolism rather than as a set of thoughts about the real world.  The student who resorts to this book will learn almost nothing about Nietzsche, but will instead absorb the shallow carelessness and crassness of a successful husband and wife team who have lost all sense and display no more critical acumen. Students, save your money!	2000-08-02

She does not believe, as another reviewer here has claimed, that women are natively stupid. Rather she claims repeatedly that they are stupid and emptyheaded by training and by choice--it is in their interest to remain stupid so as to escape responsibility. The feminists have done very little if anything a thing to change this. Their irresponsibility is legendary. They claim to have 'alternative ways of knowing' of which there can be none. They use these to escape charges of incoherence, lack of evidence or just plain meanness of spirit on any occasion they please. The academic community (including the men) have tired of the game, but it will go on for the forseeable future. The men are trained to protect the women, even when they are wrong, and pity them always. The women are engaged in the game of stacking the cards even more in favor of women, so they will do nothing. <br />This book is well worth reading. It is a cozy little book, well written and tasteful always. Vilar hopes that women can get over their irresponsibility and their use of men, but she holds out little hope.  There is nothing in this book that contradicts typical feminist \\"thinking\\" at all.	2000-08-02

The chapter on the deterioration of tolerance in China is especially helpful here. Mao and his moral dogmas were the catalyst. Prior to that, a Confucian tolerance reigned. The chapter on the French Revolution shows convincingly that the purists can be revolutionary, as any walk across campus today can reveal. The author is not interested in the zealots on campus these days, but instead aims his big guns at political tyrannies such as Communism and Fascism.	2000-08-02

This book is well worth reading. It demonstrates most amply Hollander's contention that intellectuals are not characterized solely by their critical abilities and habits. Rather, as Hollander points out time and again, they are also characterized by their opportunistic use of these abilities, and by their incredible credulity. Sartre is only one case in point: his fabulous skepticism is employed to prevent himself from coming face to face with the fact that Stalin was a monster and that Marxism could neither save a nation nor prevent mass murder. Our hyper-politicized faculty on Kampus today employ the same kinds of denial and opportunistic critique to save thier silly beliefs in the beneficence of multiculturalism, in the existence of patriarchy and in the explanatory power of cultural critique. Hollander's book is a must read for anyone who needs distance from the nonsense of our postmodernists, deconstructionists and other allegedly radical dogmas of the aging flower children.  All of them practice selective attention to their critical principles, scepticism for their enemies, and utter credultiy for their pals.	2000-05-02
