Jamie's search for answers leads her to Dillon's home and business.  Nate was killed in Dillon's home.<br />Stuart uses flashbacks to uncover the relationships of Jamie, Dillon and Nate.  The gradual revealing of the past kept me anxiously turning pages.  As Dillon and Jamie reunite--and maybe with Nate's ghost, they ignite an unfinished attraction.  <br />The relationship between Dillon and Jamie starts slowly.  Rekindling an old relationship, fighting it, and discovering their secrets gives insight into both leads.  As their relationship develops into more, Into the Fire book becomes quite sexy.

Emma, sheep farmer, and Stuart, viscount, become entangled after Stuart's carriage runs over Emma's prize sheep.  Emma tries to swindle the worth of the sheep from Stuart.  And Stuart tries to use Emma's swindling skills to get back his estate.  Stuart's Uncle Leonard swindled Stuart, convincing people of Stuart's death.<br />I'm afraid I was looking for a darker hero and Stuart seemed childish and arrogant, to me.  Expecting to see an experienced heroine, Emma seemed controlled and innocent, to me.  So much for my expectations.<br />Besides having a problem with the leads, I had problems with the plot, as the chair scene was physically impossible.  Nothing new in romance, I know.  But I expected more from Ms. Ivory.  Besides that, it wasn't particularly sexy or romantic.<br />The sting seemed short-changed, as if it was being sqeezed in among the love scenes.  And Leonard seemed quite dumb for a somewhat sucessful villian.<br />Ms. Ivory's prose shines in many places.  Some of her descriptions took me into the heart of the novel.  And Stuart's entrance into a bank made me take notice.  However, even with these pluses, I found UNTIE MY HEART a very disappointing read.	2002-12-06

Yes, her books have turned more towards suspense and away from romance. But, I think I enjoy my romantic suspense more suspense-minded anyway. The romance in her books can be a nice bonus.<br />Rennie is a surgeon who happened to foreman a jury. The jury released a probable killer, Lozada. During the trial, Lozada develops a \\"crush\\" on her. Whip is a burned-out cop who is after Lozada for the murder of his brother. Rennie and Whip come together, after the police focus on Rennie as a suspect of the murder of one of her colleagues. They never consider her the primary killer, more the motivator of the likely killer, Lozada. Whip realizes her innocence, quickly. As he begins to believe her, he protects her, learns to care for her. <br />I found the storyline not particularly original. Nor did the suspense grab me, nor did any sense of fear of the \\"bad\\" Lozada. However, I found the book very readable, well-written, and it did capture my interest. And Rennie's past makes for an interesting and unique heroine. Whip's characterization, however, seemed very familiar.<br />Also, the impetus that brings Rennie and Whip together, physically, for the first time, I found very shocking and unbelievable. I just didn't think Rennie's reaction to her tragedy was normal or likely. It certainly hurt the romance in THE CRUSH, for me.<br />With the lack of an unique storyline and a mediocre romance, I was disappointed in Sandra Brown's THE CRUSH.	2002-10-24

Along with his partner, they stop to question Avi Posner in his home.  After a confrontation, Billy the soon-to-be-hero, will plead for his life. Horribly wounded and embarrassed, he is treated for wounds both mental and physical. He then will return home, to Nebraska, still very affected by his experience. Demons will haunt him.<br />One of the things that makes this book so special, is the characterization of Billy Tree. Not often does a reader see such a severely haunted \\"hero\\", carry on so heroically. The peaceful town he has returned to, has turned out to be not so peaceful. It's a town full of secrets, and every kind of \\"bad guy\\" you could think of.<br />Besides Billy, the reader meets sister Kath, friend Joan, the sheriff who is also the coroner, and the tough guys and hoods from Billy's childhood. Those tough guys have sons, and they will be part of the force that drives Billy to help with a school shooting.<br />There's not a page to be turned in this action-packed book, without something happening. Besides the action, there's a mystery, some romance, and of course the small-town experience. Heartland is a great read.	2002-08-29

I found this book very interesting reading.  From each author, I gained new insight into why I like to read romance, and why it's written the way it is.  Many of us readers do like the &quot;alpha&quot; hero, or even as in Anne Stuart's words--the vampire hero.  Why the authors like them, write about them, and entertains us with these heroes, fascinates me. To read about the balance the adventurous heroine needs, entertains me.   And, I love Laura Kinsale's place-holder heroine, her writing on point of view, as well as Jayne Krentz's defense of the genre, in general. Excellent book, worth reading and keeping.	2002-08-22

Brandon will become enamored with Alyson, a woman with a hidden agenda.<br />To the writer's credit, I was able to read this suspense, but didn't find it particularly suspenseful.

All the secondary characters are fascinating, too.  And, I would like to see some of their stories continue.  <br />My only quibble with this book, was in the way all of Lauren's and Kit's mysteries, problems, are wrapped up so quickly.  A Summer to Remember, really should have been longer.  Otherwise, this book was almost perfect.	2002-08-18

And, her viewpoint is sad and touching, violent and scary, and funny and wistful.  I found her part, very engrossing.<br />But, I thought Ms. Seybold resorted to stereotypes, and things we've seen and read before, for the rest of the characters.  The father's anger and behavior is understandable, but expected.  And, what does the grieving wife and mother do?  The same here, as in many of those other sad and meaningful? books.  Then there is the wise grandmother, the weird friends. <br />And Susie returns to earth, to do what?  She was 14 years old when she was murdered.<br />Finally, the ending wasn't one I would hope for.  Too neat and quick a resolution, for me.	2002-08-15

Also, there's Ford, Rabbit, and Thomas and Phin pops in, and there are others.<br />It says something when my favorite character in the book and most memorable one is Clea, the bad girl; I could at least see her purpose, and the reasons for the things she did.  I did like Davy and Tilda, but their charcterizations were on the light side.  Mostly you read about their attempts at a physical relationship, and their attempts at recovering their missing items.  Also, there were the movie titles and song titles, and...<br />This book had some really good moments, and Ms. Crusie's writing is very clever.

Stonegate Farm on Still Lake, in Colby, Vermont is Sophie's choice for her undertaking.  Unfortunately, the area has a grisly history.  Twenty years before, the murders of three teenaged girls occurred there.  But, Sophie's determined, since her new farm will make a good home and project, for herself, her mother Grace, and teenaged sister, Marty.<br />John Smith, alias of Thomas Ingram Griffin, was convicted of the murders of the three girls.  On a technicality, he was released from prison just a few years after his incarceration.  John decides it is time to find the real murderer of the three girls.  Or, did he really do it?  He can't remember what happened the night the third girl was killed.  As fate would have it, he returns to Colby to rent a cabin neigboring Stonegate farm.  And, as fate would have it, Sophie and John will meet.<br />STILL LAKE is a fast-moving read.  The descriptions of the beautiful countryside in Vermont, put me there.  The relationship between Sophie and John is fascinating.  While they appear as opposites at first, I understood their attraction, felt the sexual tension, and enjoyed their lustful, then loving, romance.  <br />Secondary characters in STILL LAKE entertain also.  Grace seems befuddled, Marty an angst-filled teen, and yet each contributes to the fast-moving pages.  <br />While I think most readers would find the villian pretty obvious, I thought the real mystery was how and why the murders happened. Also, feeling the menace that comes from the villian throughout the book, adds to the suspense.  <br />STILL LAKE is the kind of book I look for.  It's a great story with a sexy romance, and  page-turning suspense.	2002-08-01

He then trys to convince Marietta to allow him to be a father to her baby, and her husband.  Sceptical scientist, Marietta, wants no part of his plans.  <br />Ms. Gardner does a wonderful job of making the sparks fly between Jax and Marietta.  And, she has a very interesting subplot about a secondary couple, which is almost as tantalizing. While, there are light touches of humor, for me, touches of tears, too. <br />THE MISCONCEPTION could have used a  more sensuality, and I wish the book had been longer.  I really enjoyed the secondary couple.  Finally, the ending was a bit over-the-top, for me.	2002-05-23

A masked woman and her cohorts robs railroad magnate, Rafe Belloch.  The woman's not content enough with just his money and loose valuables.  She has Rafe strip.  And as she laughingly escapes the scene of her crime, she taunts Rafe.  Rafe, embarassed and angry, swears revenge.<br />Two years later, Mystere Rillieux and Rafe are at a ball together.  It is in New York (1883), and also present at the ball,  people like the Astors and Vanderbilts.  Rafe immediately suspects Mystere as being his masked robber, and also Lady Moonlight.  Lady Moonlight is suspected of robbing rich patrons at New York's society's various entertainments.  The games between Mystere and Rafe begins, that night.<br />I probably enjoyed that opening scene between Mystere and Rafe, more than any other scene in this book.  Mystere seems adventuresome and tough.  As I met Mystere as Lady Moonlight, she seemed more a victim, and less sure of herself.  I guess I liked the first Mystere better.  And Rafe's character seemed to switch between tortured and cocky.  Because of these two--and I liked them--the appeal of the book faltered at times, for me.  Also, I would have enjoyed seeing more interactions between them.  MOONLIGHT BECOMES HER is heavily populated with a large supporting cast.<br />I really enjoyed MOONLIGHT BECOMES HER.  Ms. McKinney's writing definitely took me to the New York city of the 1880's.  This well-written book, was almost a keeper.	2001-11-18

Doing that causes tension enough in Moira's life, but her old boyfried Daniel, is also at that reunion. <br />Using the Irish conflict as the suspense part of Heather Graham's romantic suspense, was intriguing.  And, the book starts off very well. There's an early murder that sets up the feeling of menace, at Moira's family reunion.  Unfortunately, my full enjoyment of the book, probably ended at that point.<br />Moira's mixed feelings about her two men, Michael and Daniel, caused me, as a reader, feelings of distaste.  When she eventually decides on one of them, the romance felt short-changed.  Not the sex, just the romance. <br />Also, although there is another murder in the book, and Moira's life is threatened by accidents, for me, the culprit seemed rather obvious.  So, not only did I feel the romance was short-changed, so was the suspense.  Add those facts to the heavy details about the Irish conflict and the weak romance, I really felt disappointed by this book.  It really had a very good beginning.	2001-10-17

But, a book about sexual encounters between nice characters, just doesn't have enough substance, for me.  And, Jack's big secret at the end of the book, is almost too silly to include.  Especially, since there are big hints throughout the book, about his secret.  Romance light, Kleypas light, in this circumstance, just makes me miss the Kleypas style of some of her earlier books.

Pompasse had many vices, and one of them causes his murder.<br />Connor Maguire is a burnt out war correspondent.  Due to his wishes for escape from a career that took too much from him, he becomes a reporter for a scandal magazine, THE STARLIGHT. His new career will send him to cover the murder of Pompasse, and the women who have surrounded the famous painter, including Charlie.  He will go to Tuscany undercover, and meet Charlie on her return for Pompasse's funeral.<br />As sparks fly between Charlie and Connor, they will fight a mutual attraction, as well as try to solve the mystery of the murdered Pompasse.  Due to the painter's desire to be surrounded by very young, attractive women, there will be several suspects to choose from.  Charlie's mother, Pompasse's latest model, and even some of his now older, previous models will all be suspect.   <br />For me, the strongest part of THE WIDOW is the personification of the two leads, the tension between them, and a very sexy consumation.  The supporting cast is interesting, but I was really caught up in the drama between Charlie and Connor.  By the end of the book, I really felt like I knew them.<br />The weakest part of the book, for me, was the mystery.  Aristride Pompasse, most of the supporting cast are so unlikeable, that I didn't really care who the killer was.  For that reason alone, I would have given THE WIDOW 4 1/2 stars, instead of 5.  <br />Connor is not one of Anne Stuart's darker heroes, but he is a charmer.

Rafe's seduction, will change Julia's path.<br />As Rafe seduces Julia, he finds himself charmed, a bit seduced, himself.  They will marry; and, Julia will find out the true circumstances behind Rafe's seduction.  How their relationship endures, they achieve their HEA, is the main focus of MEET ME AT MIDNIGHT.<br />There are so many things I liked about this book.  I consider it very romantic.   Watching Julia and Rafe change and grow, due to their relationship, kept me turning the pages.  And, the sexuality in the book is very warm, but not overstated.  Finally, I found this book to be very tempestuous, emotional--something I haven't seen in a new book, for a long time.	2001-05-26

Unable to find out anything about the baby's parents, she adopts her, and names her Maggie.<br />Rand Higgins is horribly injured and disfigured, the night of the Chicago fire.  His wife leaves him and Chicago, and he believes his child, Christine, is dead.<br />Five years later, Lucy owns a bookstore, The Firebrand, and nees a loan.  She meets with a banker, Rand, and discovers the child she has adopted is his Christine.  She decides to tell Rand of her discovery, in spite of her deep love for Maggie. The dilemma between the two, Lucy and Rand--deciding what's best for Maggie.<br />Lucy is a suffragist, a fighter for equal rights for all, especially women.  Because of his past, Rand has a  natural, and understandable distrust for women.  In my mind, Ms. Wiggs bringing these two disparate people together in a believable way, is what makes this book so good.  Neither character's true self is sacrificed to bring this book to a HEA for all involved.  Lucy, Rand, and Maggie are wonderful characters.  And even secondary characters like Rand's grandmother, Lucy's mother seem to walk off the pages of THE FIREBRAND.<br />My only complaint with THE FIREBRAND would be that I, personally, would have liked to read more about the romance and relationship between Rand and Lucy.  And, I do prefer books with a little more sensuality.  Otherwise, this book was perfect.	2001-04-15

It only takes a few pages into the book, before you understand--Ellen has good reason to dislike Randy.  But, what can, what will Ellen do, to save her daughter.<br />As Ellen becomes involved in her daughter's problems, she revisits some of her own.  And, she and husband Scott, will be visited by their nephew, Neal.  Neal, is the character that will bring this mesmerizing book to its climax.  And, it's Neal who will contribute heavily, to the suspense of this page-turning read.<br />If you're like me--you're not going to find any characters in MOUTH TO MOUTH, ones you care about.  And yet, you'll have to keep reading this book, until you finish it.  It has a little bit of everything--action and suspense, family drama, a book full of unusual characters, and even sensuality.  I was sorry to finish this one.  And, I've already tracked down Kimball's previous book, UNDONE.	2001-04-15

But, they are friends only because their fathers are aquaintances.  They will spend time together, as their fathers do.  But, beyond that, they will barely acknowledge each other. Of the three boys, Dave has always been the different one, maybe the nerdy one, the victim.<br />On a day when the three are getting into mischief, a car stops, and a man calls out, claiming to be a policeman.  Of the three, only Dave will get into the man's car.  The car will speed away, leaving Sean and Jimmy behind; and, the three boys, will be sometime-friends no more.  Dave will escape the man/men that have captured him.  But he will return a troubled and tortured boy.  All his peers, and the adults he knows, will suspect what has happened to him.  His victimization will continue.<br />Years later, Jimmy's daughter is killed.  Jimmy has been in prison, has ties to his local mafia.  What he may or may not do to help solve his daughter's murder, is the focus of Lehane's Mystic River. And, Sean, a policeman, will be the officer leading the murder investigation of Jimmy's daughter. Dave, will become a center of that investigation.  Those who know Dave, including his wife, fears the &quot;victim&quot; has become a &quot;victimizer&quot;.<br />Even though it has been a month since I'd read this book, I have found myself haunted by it.  These boys/men seemed so real to me.  And yes, the book is depressing; there is no happy ending.  But, it is a book I didn't put down, until I'd finished it.	2001-03-08

Because of that, she will approach Kevin in a secretive way.  That, and her rash personality will cause her to do something that quite frankly, I see as unforgivable.  And, maybe, because of that poor beginning for me, I could not get into this book.  I just never learned to like Molly.  <br />Reckless, stupid, self-pitying, are all adjectives I could use to describe Molly.  And maybe because the book so centers on Molly, that Kevin's personality seems  to fade into the scenery, at times.  With several other issues going on in the book--the anti-gay group, two other romances, Kevin's problems with his parentage, his problem with the camp itself--I just didn't see any growing up, or growing together, between Molly and Kevin. <br />Ms. Phillips is such a skillful writer.  She writes scenes that are laugh-out-loud funny, and I particularly enjoyed the excerpts at the beginning of each chapter, that tells the story of Daphne the Bunny, and Benny the Badger.   I just wish I had enjoyed the story about Molly and Kevin.	2001-02-21

When he finds out that his &quot;deposit&quot; has been used, a baby born to someone, he must find them, both...Jake goes to the home of Annie, a rancher, a tea-leaf reader, a mother, but not a wife....<br />At first there is antagonism between Jake and Annie.  Eventually, there will be a friendship, a romance.  These two characters are opposites--Jake, a &quot;stuffed-shirt&quot; type, and Annie, a &quot;kook&quot;.  Somehow, though, you see them working together for Madeline's sake, (Baby), and maybe, each other, too.<br />The cover of this book made me think comedy. Yes, there are funny moments; but, the subject is a serious one.  Also, there's a sweet secondary romance, that held my interest.<br />One of the things I liked about this book is the origin of the title.  When you read about it, you will understand what I mean.  Something I didn't like was a bit of the comedy directed at the villianess.  Maybe a bit too &quot;slapstick&quot; for me. However, this book really was a pleasure to read.	2001-02-08

Later, when he finds her journal, he thinks she's a &quot;lady of the evening&quot;.  For in that journal, Olivia describes the men she has met. She uses that information, to pair off her friends.  When Hawke learns his mistake, he tries to make amends.  And, Olivia tries to avoid him.  Then, when Hawke learns Olivia owns property next to his home, he makes plans to seduce her.  What happens between these two is an interesting battle? romance?<br />The very best thing about this book, is the characterizations.    Olivia is a strong heroine, Hawke, the tortured hero who masks his pain with his charm, good looks.  Memories of a war he has survived has given him dreams, and thus, he drinks too much. As Hawke tries to conquer his demons, Olivia must decide what to do about the feelings she has for him. Besides the two wonderful leads, Ms. Becnel introduces us to some interesting family members of both Hawke, Olivia, and each plays an important roll in The Matchmaker. <br />As a reader, I found this book entertaining but lacking in passion?.  Hawke uses his sensuality to beguile Olivia, and I expected to see that in love scenes, as the relationship progressed. I found that part of this otherwise good book, weak.  Still, this is a book worth reading.  And, I will be looking for this author again.	2001-02-02

And yes, it is that, and  more....<br />LaCasa de Sombras (House of Shadows) in Los Angelos, is the only  real home Jilly Meyer has ever known.  She lives there with her adopted  sister Rachel-Ann, and her younger brother, Dean.   She is compelled to  protect both the house and her siblings from their villianous father,  Jackson Meyer.  <br />Coltrane is Jackson's lawyer, the keeper of Jackson's  secrets, and a man with an agenda.  As he contrives to move into the  House  of Shadows, he contrives to seduce Jilly.  Enigmatic and handsome, a man  with a revenge-laden plan, he will be suprised himself, by secrets within  the old mansion.<br />Besides the Meyer siblings and Coltrane, the house is  inhabited  by a pair of ghosts, Brenda and Ted, actress and director,  victims of a murder-suicide pact, years ago.<br />But, the focus of the novel  is Jilly and Coltrane.  Jilly is  strong but needy, Coltrane is harsh but  giving.  Their love scenes graduate from warm, to sexy, to hot.  Add to  their story, a secondary romance for Rachel-Ann, that may bring tears to  your eyes.  And, the otherworldly romance between Ted and Brenda, adds a  touch of laughter (and maybe a few tears, too).<br />Secrets and truths, love  and hate, revenge and redemption, collide in this fast-paced novel.  As I  finished it, I couldn't forget about Coltrane and Jilly and  Rachel-Ann...So, I picked the book up, and read it again.  Something I've  never done before.	2000-09-01

Murder	Mr. Perfect was a great book for me--for about a third of the way through.  <br />I've never read a book of Ms. Howard's, with so much humor.  And I enjoyed the byplay between characters, especially Jaine and Sam.  How Jaine  and Sam meet, is for me, the most enjoyable part of the book.  But, romance  occurs swiftly (there's no romantic conflict) and the murder/mystery  occurs.  It's at that point in the book, where it falters, for me.<br />If you  find one of your best friend's been murdered--do you feel like making  love...as fear and possibly murder, surround you.    The sex scenes are  sexy, and well done.  But they occur too     soon, too frequently, given  the circumstances.<br />Sam's a typical Linda Howard hero...BIG, handsome,  alpha and sex-driven.  Jaine's gifted with a smart mouth, brains,   beauty...And, I did enjoy them as a couple.  The secondary characters are  interesting; (including the murderer) but there may have been too many of  them to give any individual attention.<br />The mystery will be a  surprise...and there is a feeling of doom (when the comedy or sex isn't  going on).  I guess, this is a very mixed review....	2000-07-27

While reading this book, Ms. Brockway carried me away, and I visited that Isle, and its fascinating  inhabitants--including that villian I love to hate, Lord Carr.<br />While much  of the action takes place in London, the last half of this book is back on  the &quot;Isle&quot;, when Thomas Donne &quot;abducts&quot; Fia, the  ravishing one.  Thomas and Fia, have a past, present, but will they have a  future?  <br />Fia is a tormented heroine; she's very much like Ash.  Because  of her father, she doesn't feel deserving of good things.  And Thomas, has  an agenda that may make a romance between him and Fia seem impossible.<br />I  only put this book down when I had to, and when I finished it.  And, I  hated the fact that I may have taken my last trip to McClairen's Isle. In  the Ravishing One, you get to revisit all the &quot;special&quot;  inhabitants--Ash and Rhiannon, Raine and Favor, as well as Gunna and Lord  Carr.

To me, this book was none of the above...I  found this book very boring...None of the characters add thrills, suspense, or romance to the story.   And, never for a moment, was I excited, terrified, or immersed in this  book.  <br />I've read Ms. Garwood before.  Her male characters are usually  charismatic, her heroines entertaining, her love scenes, sexy. I saw none  of that, in this book. To me, two stars may be high.

Having gone through this situation myself, I believed the premise.  My problem was the book itself.  <br />Ms. Putney's characters, for me, displayed only surface emotions.  I  never understood their behavior patterns--the problems that drove them  apart.  Or, the problems that drove them together.  And, probably as it  SHOULDN'T be, I actually liked Donovan better than Kate.  <br />Secondly, I  found the story going in too many directions, with too many characters.   The problems of Tom, Kate's brother, may have belonged in another novel.   Also, the secondary romance, while nice, distracted me from what was  probably meant to be the &quot;burning point&quot;.  Add to that the  &quot;mystery?&quot;, you've got a book, that is, only half done--in  several places.  Also, I found Ms. Putney's contemporary-speak, uneven.   <br />Will I try another contemporary by Ms. Putney.  I kind of doubt it.

She has bartered her innocence for the release of Derrick, and her maid. <br />Years later, James  (Diego) returns to England to right the wrong done Honoria, by offering  marriage.  He also has a hidden motive. <br />The best part of this book, for  me, was Honoria herself.  She is such an entertaining heroine.  Reading the  conversations she has with herself, as she battles her attraction to James,  made this a worthy read.  Plot, secondary characters, as well as James,  made this a &quot;keeper&quot; for me.<br />The romance itself, is told mostly  in flashbacks.  Sexual tension is created this way.  It's not done in an  usual &quot;will they, or won't they&quot; scenario.  The romance builds,  along with the story, through the flashbacks.  Sometimes a method like this  can be confusing to the reader.  For me, it added suspense, as well as  sexual tension, to create a page-turning read.<br />There are many secondary  characters--Derrick, the fathers, servants, and villians.  All add to the  plot and, the romance.  <br />I found this book a special read; and Honoria  has become one of my favorite heroines.	2000-05-12

At  first, Cole suspects Jonet to be a possible murderess, seductress.  As they  overcome their suspicions, a romance develops. <br />Jonet is such an unusual  and strong heroine.  She loses control of her emotions, and her desire for  Cole.  It's an unusual slant, to read about a heroine pursuing a hero in  the way Jonet does.  Cole fights his attraction to Jonet; thus, he seems  strong and vulnerable, at the same time.  Both characters, help to make  this book an excellent read.<br />My only problems with A Woman Scorned had to  do with the wordiness, at the beginning of the book.  However, with the  great story, great characters, sexy love scenes--I'll keep the book anyway;  and, I'll read it again.	2000-05-12

He took Daisy's virginity, breaks her heart?, and leaves without any plesantries.  Nine years later, Nick hires Daisy as his bodyguard.  And, the fireworks are  renewed.<br />Baby Don't Go was not a good read, for me.  I had problems with  the stereotypes.  Daisy's a security specialist, wears combat boots, cuts  her own hair with manicure scissors, skips makeup.  Nick as a one-time  rich, playboy-type, calls Daisy Blondie, etc.; and, he has nicknames for  certain parts of his own person.  Daisy's male secretary, Reggie, and  Reggie's friends meet a certain stereotype also.  Then there's the  &quot;goons&quot;, and the pillar-of-society bad guy.  Maybe they are all  meant to be funny, but the humor was beyond me.  <br />Love/sex scenes, to me,  seemed long, detailed, boring.  I found myself skimming them.  I just  didn't see the relationship develop.  I didn't see where the feelings Daisy  and Nick had for each other, came from.  Neither one, were characters I  liked, or related to.<br />The plot, was secondary to relationships.  The  secondary characters, Mo (Nick's sister), and her husband Reid, were the  reason I kept reading the book.  And, Ms. Andersen's writing has a certain  flow, that kept me reading, also.  I just wish I had enjoyed the story, as  much as the writing.	2000-05-11

Holly pursues Sam, in spite of misgivings.  And the  relationship eventually progresses into a romance.   The characterizations  of both Holly and Sam, were very complete.  However, I found the romance  itself, lacking.  Sam is almost rude to Holly; and, I couldn't see where  their eventual feelings for each other, came from.  The love scenes  themselves, were more warm, rather than hot.<br />The main reason I would not  give SAFE HARBOR a better rating is due to my own expectations (right or  wrong).  I wanted to get to know the &quot;bad girl Eden&quot; a little  better.  Unfortunately, she only makes a couple appearances.  Also, I was  looking for more confrontations between characters like Eden, Holly's  parents, Sam and Holly etc.  Instead, I read about Holly's sister, her  sister's children, and her sister's bad marriage.  The book had little good  to say about any marriage, of any of the main characters.<br />Locale made  this book a good read. Also, I enjoyed Ms. Stockenberg's writing.  It's  very easy to turn the pages of this book.  Maybe not quite 4 stars--but,  certainly better than 3.	2000-04-29

However, when Devon happens upon Leah  &quot;where&quot; he does, and &quot;when&quot; he does...it's too much  coincidence for me. <br />Devon has a secret/secrets and Leah has a child.   Besides these situations, there's the families' feuds.  And, then an  &quot;old&quot; secret is revealed.  For me, there were too many problems,  too many obstacles, too easily solved.  I expected a more tumultuous read,  a more passionate romance.  Instead, it seemed a comfortable read with two  pleasing leads.  Even the love scene(s) seemed comfortable.

I'm not a fan of anthologies--stories too incomplete, rushed.  Ms. Stuart manages somehow, to convey a complete  romance in her story.  There's a prologue that makes you wonder....an  epilogue that is really cute.  In between you have, as the girls call him,  a &quot;hottie&quot; for a hero, and a very different heroine.

I didn't like the use of the baby, in this one.  But, the story is  romantic and is a good, sexy read.	2000-02-16

Her mother sends her to Treadwell School.  Nicola doesn't plan to stay.  However, fencing lessons with an owner of the school, and then with Lord Brian Boru, changes her plans.   Nicola is an unusually entertaining heroine.  Is she the 'ugly duckling'  whom turns into a 'swan'...or just a beauty in the eyes of Lord Brian and  her other suitor.<br />Lord Brian's crippled knee was often forgotten, by me,  due do his incredible magnetism.  He definitely is a 'tortured hero', but  one whose self pity never takes away from his 'hero' qualities.<br />The  scenes between Nicola and Brian develop gradually from antagonism, into  mutual admiration, into incredibly sexy scenes. <br />Other inhabitants from  the school, as well as Nicola's family, Brian's aide, are entertaining  secondary characters.<br />This was not a 'keeper' due to some unlikely scenes  in the book.  The ending was particularly weak, for me, due to a kidnapping  along with the arrival of Nicola's twin, and her mother's reappearance.   However, it was well worth my time and money.  Ms. Kingson's prose, just  flows....	2000-02-11

She's running from the mob; and he's running from her, his family, his memories.  Also, he's trying to protect Alessandra.<br />I really liked the ideas behind this story.  It  really is my favorite kind of read--one with plenty of action, some  suspense, good supporting characters (too good!), and love scenes.<br />My  problems with Body Guard/Bodyguard is the fact that the partner seemed much  more interesting than Harry.  Harry, for me, was actually the weaker lead.  I liked Alessandra.  She tries to take care of herself, rise from the ashes  etc. Harry is a tortured hero without a whole lot of pluses.  I'm afraid I  pictured Peter Falk of Columbo fame when I read this book.  At least, until  Harry put on his jeans.  Now Harry's partner--let's all hope that becomes a  full story!<br />I, too, had problems with the Azalea bush.  And so that I  don't give away too much plot--I'll say nothing more.  Also didn't like  Harry going to see his kids when he and Alessandra are being tracked.   Seemed way too risky and unlikely a scenario.  I guess to complete the  romance part of the story, Ms. Brockmann had to bring the characters  together.  But, I found that plot thread very weak.  <br />Finally, I think  this would be a better book to listen to or watch--because of all the  action and the plot.  Certainly not a bad read, just a disappointment.	2000-01-24

Kitty, the &quot;Cat&quot; and &quot;Tiger&quot; meet one night in the home of a wealthy Englishman.  Each is searching for a ruby called The Blood of India.<br />Tiger is actually Max, the adopted son of an Italian  count.  Kitty is the daughter of an Englishman and his half-Indian wife.   Due to a freedom attack on English children, Kitty had left India in fear.   Max reminds her of Cameron, a boy she was in love with while she lived in  India.  She saw Cameron killed; and she has dreamed of him, and India,  through the years.<br />Max and Kitty have an instant attraction.  However,  their desire for the same stone, will lure them into trouble and a  reluctant partnership.  Each has a compelling reason to find that stone,  The Blood of India.  And those reasons will pull them apart.  The story  itself, will tell us what, if anything, will bring them together.<br />Max and  Kitty are two magnetic leads.  Kitty flies planes, is an adventuress, and  is engaged to Cameron's half brother.  Max is a wealthy womanizer, and  adventurer, with a hidden past.  His sensual pull, grabbed me, as a reader.   I could easily see why Kitty would desire him.<br />I learned things about  India, it's beauty, some of it's history, while reading this book.  Ms.  O'Neal, herself, lived in India at one time.   Combined with the history,  is an interesting plot, lots of action, a complete cast of supporting  characters, and several sexy love scenes.<br />This is a book I really  enjoyed.

He gets an anonymous call about a person whom might have witnessed the murder of his brother-in-law, a womanizing senator. This particular case, tied to this  murder, is what cost Jake his job.  Naturally, he's anxious to pursue the  witness.  His policeman friends, his sister(wife of the dead man) want him  to forget about any such pursuits.<br />Sarah is hiding in a resort in Aspen.   She was in the senator's room, when he was murdered.  Why she was in the  room, and what she saw, are questions Jakes asks himself, as he's pursuing  her.  While tracking Sarah down, he develops a &quot;crush&quot;.  When he  meets her, it develops into more.<br />The premise of the book, the plot, is  good.  However, there were many times when I almost put the book down, and  didn't finish it.  It did not hold my interest as far as characterizations  were concerned.  Too many supporting players, not understanding their  motivations, made each one seem unimportant to the plot.  And, to make  matters worse, I thought I knew whom the &quot;bad guy&quot; was.  Not  knowing for sure, forced me to finish the book.  Unfortunately, I was  right.  And believe me, I think it's pretty obvious.<br />As far as the  romance is concerned...what romance?  Sarah naturally is mad at Jake when  she discovers his real motivation for being around her.  And if she  forgives Jake for that  motivation, why does she do so.  And love  scenes...what love scenes?  I don't remember the scenes in Ms. Ericson's  previous books, being this tepid.<br />The plot, the scenery, help me give  this book 3 stars.  But in reality, that's a little high.  For me, there  was no suspense, no romance, in Searching for Sarah.	2000-01-17

Each seduces the other; each feels guilty about it later.  Serena is seduced by Nicholas's need, and beauty.  Nicholas is seduced by Serena's loneliness, her beauty.  Each suspects the other of wrong motives.  <br />Ms. Bradley has an unique voice.  Her writing,  her sentence structures, her wording seems almost lyrical to me.  However,  she never veers into what I would term &quot;purple prose&quot;.<br />There is  a great villian...beautiful leads...interesting settings...sexy love  scenes.  All make for a great book, one that will probably  be a  &quot;keeper&quot; for me.  <br />I want to give it 5 stars, but I have a  couple of  things that bothered me throughout the book.  Nicholas is  definitely a tortured hero.  I have no problem with tortured heros; but, I  thought his reasoning on doubting Serena made no real sense--tortured hero  or not.  Serena's motive was a little more reasonable; but, I got tired of  reading about it.  Great devices to keep the leads apart--but maybe not  realistic ones.  But, neither quibble, would keep me from reading this book  again.  I hope to read more of this author's works, soon.	2000-01-11

Tessa must leave her grandfather and France, and return to England.  She leaves with her grandfather's secretary, Ross.  They have had an adversarial relationship. She is spoiled, and willful.  He is strong and  bossy; and, he has  secrets.  Their relationship, will lead to a marriage  of convenience.  Their marriage of convenience leads to a tempestuous  romance.<br />The Bride's Bodyguard starts with a murder, in the very first  chapter.  You immediately know, that you're reading a special historical.  It is one that has a mystery, a slow-developing love story, and quite a few  supporting players.  Each player is  well defined.  Each, has a role in the  mystery, as well as in the romance.  <br />Tessa and Ross are  beguiling  leads.  Tessa is both childish and mature, while being a strong heroine.   Ross is the enigmatic, tortured (with good reason) hero.  Their love scenes  together, are sexy, and wonderfully written. <br />This is a complete read,  for me.  It is a book, that has all the ingredients I need, in a romance.   It has a great plot, strong leads, a good supporting cast,and sexy love  scenes.	2000-01-10

Winnie the linguist, tries to correct the manners, elocution, of Mick the ratcatcher.  Two brothers bid Winnie and Mick do this in time for an important ball, which is to be hosted by Winnie's cousin.  Winnie doesn't  like her cousin; and, she is thrilled with the thought of fooling him.   Mick likes Winnie, and the possibility of earning a good deal of  money.<br />I've been reading Ms. Ivory since she started writing as Judy  Cuevas.  I always like her books.  And, to say that she has improved with  each book, is something I would agree with.  The first page, tells you that  you're reading a &quot;masterpiece&quot;.  But, it's just not my kind of  &quot;masterpiece&quot;.  And, I'll try to explain why....<br />Maybe, because  Ms. Ivory is such a good writer; her characterizations done so well, I  could never forget Winnie's spinsterish persona, her seemingly uptight  personality.  And, I had the same problem with Mick.  Handsome as he is,  sweet as his personality seems, ladies' man that he is, I never forget his  occupation.  As a result, I never learn to like Winnie or Mick.<br />The story  itself, is too contained for me.  It has very few supporting players--the  strongest support coming from the butler, Milton, and Mick's  &quot;pets&quot;.  Also, I found my attention wandering, and kept waiting  for something to happen.  I understand that most readers found the  relationship itself, that &quot;something&quot;.  For me, it's just not  quite enough.  I saw a book about mores, and the effects they have on  relationships.  But, I also saw it as a book about sexual tension.  And,  when I got to the part about the consumation of that tension--well, to be  honest, I really disliked the sound effects, and even the descriptions used  in the love scene.  Once again, Ms. Ivory just may have done too good a a  job with her writing, for me.<br />Finally, like others whom have read this  book, I found the ending to be too convenient, and unlikely.  <br />Will I  recommendthis book to friends?  No, probably not.  Will I recommend this  author?  Yes.  I will always be a fan of such skill, in storytelling.	2000-01-05

King Henry sends his court jester, Nicholas to the home of Hugh, the Earl of Fordham.  Nicholas is to be a wedding present for the earl, and his bride, Isabeau.  At the same time, Julianna, Isabeau's widowed daughter, is  summoned to the home also.  Nicholas and Julianna share a litter on their  ride to the earl's home.  We, as readers, get to eavesdrop on their  wickedly funny conversation.  And of course, we share in their romance, as  well.<br />Nicholas has a hidden agenda.  At King Henry's behest, he's to find  the chalice of Saint Hugelina, the Dragon, and bring it to him.  Julianna,  and others, stand in his way.  Julianna, has suffered a miserable marriage  and wishes to join a convent.  She has no wish to join with a  &quot;fool&quot;, a court jester.  Nicholas, however, has different ideas.  How Nicholas brings his two goals together, is what makes this book so very  good.<br />This story is peopled with many interesting supporting characters.   Hugh and Isabeau provide an unusual secondary romance.  There's a priest  who is truly evil, and a Brother Abbot who has his own agenda.  Gilbert, a  fosterling of Hugh's has a sweet face and a &quot;killer&quot; disposition.   All, and others, play major rolls in the finding of the chalice, and in  Julianna's and Nicholas' romance. <br />This is not a &quot;dark&quot;  romance.  There is humor, sly and clever innuendoes, Nicholas' rhymes,  bawdy songs.  If you're like me, you'll find yourself laughing out loud.   And yet none of the humor hurts the romance, at all.  The sensuality is  sweet, but also erotic.  And, Nicholas and Julianna felt very  &quot;real&quot; to me.  I read, and enjoyed this book in one sitting; and,  I will read it again soon.  This was a &quot;keeper&quot; for me!	1999-12-28

On the run from her past, Emma and daughter Gracie, stop in Port Flannery, Washington.  Emma meets Sheriff Elvis Donnelly.  The attraction between physically-flawed Elvis, and practically-perfect Emma is what makes this  book so  good.  Emma's a truly strong heroine; and, Elvis is less confident  in himself, than most heros in the romantic suspense genre. <br />When Emma's  past catches up with her, Elvis becomes Emma's and Gracie's protector.   Little surprizes occur, that keep the suspense and action moving.  <br />This  is an excellent book.  And while not as dark as Ms. Andersen's earliest  books (Obsession, Present Danger, Shadow Dance), it's nothing like either  of her &quot;Baby&quot; books. Humor is very subtle.	1999-12-21

The troupe  is filled with interesting people.  And even if you think you know all  that's going on, you'll probably still be surprized by some of the things  that happen.<br />I've enjoyed this book more than once.

She's a  disaster waiting to happen.  He's decided she's his good luck charm.  And  she thinks they are in love.  Resolving the charm/lover dilemna is the  story's theme.

Drake has the  mortgage to Alicia and Gerald's home. Drake has set the marriage up, to  seek vengeance.  In my view, this was the only &quot;scoundrelous&quot;  behaviour on Drake's part.<br />Drake cares for Alicia's mother.  He takes  into his employment the needy people he encounters--a deaf maid, an  accounts manager in a wheelchair, a drunken butler...and so on.   The only  conflict , is the original motivations for Drake's and Alicia's marriage.   I think, because of that, this is a slow read, at times.  Also, I felt  somewhat manipulated.  I felt the author tried too hard to get the reader  to love Drake.<br />This book, has many pluses.  I enjoyed the supporting  characters; a secondary romance was very entertaining.  The love scenes are  very well done.  There's no purple prose; but each scene, is uniquely sexy.   <br />This book may not be a keeper for me.

In fact skip all Ms. Brown's new books---she's trying to distance herself from us all.  Suspense fans, this is an OK read, Hammond Cross is an interesting character.  And the mystery,  did keep me guessing--for a short time.  This is one of those authors, that  has dropped off my automatic buy list.  This book is worth a trade at the  UBS, and that's about it!	1999-11-20

And, after buying both Ms. Howard's last books in hardback, I can tell you it WON'T happen again!  Her last book, Now You See Her was stupid, with it's hurried-up ending, and dragged out sensuality.   This one is just plain boring.  Where was the romance?  Pray tell me, what  was the mystery, that made this a romantic supsense?  And why bother with  those stupid love scenes?  They were just thrown in to add spice.  This is  definitely an author who's talents are depleting with each book.  Read her  old ones for the first time, or reread them!  Skip her last two books!	1999-11-20

But, he's also a killer; isn't he?  Margaret is destitute, and worried about her daughter; before, she is even willing to meet her dead husband's family.  One day in the home of this family, and you understand that Margaret might be better off worried about destitution!  Add to the mystery, a masquerade, Mardi Gras, a family mansion, weird  relatives; you really have a marvelous old-time gothic.	1999-11-13

The couple was very likeable; but, the romance does not develop.  I also had problems with Jerrot's inconsistencies on several of  the storylines.  She doesn't know what to do with Rik's daughter; and,  you're not real sure why she bothered with inserting her in the plot.  Ms.  Jerrot didn't know what to do about the subject of birth control either.   Each love scene, seems to cover it differently.  I also had a problem with  a horseback ride that the couple take.  While behind Rik on a horse, the  heroine describes seeing sweat roll down Rik's throat.  Physically, I don't  believe this is possible.  Is it poor editing?   It seems a sexy book like  this one, will be appreciated whether there are weaknesses or not.	1999-11-11

It's like taking a trip to the &quot; big easy&quot; with a very entertaining family!  Peter, (the crazy one) is  under house arrest, when Margaret comes to stay. She, and her daughter  might be the cure that Peter needs.  The mystery, sexual tension, and the  fun of Mardi Gras add to the spice of this great book.  It truly is a  keeper!	1999-11-06

As an Anne Stuart fan, it's very easy for me to recommend this book!  All three of these stories, are keeper material.  Rafe's Revenge is one of  those true &quot;opposites attract&quot; stories.  Rafe and Silver are  truly well-defined leads.  Hand in Glove takes the reader to a puppet  theater for romance and dark scares.  This is one of Ms. Stuart's more  violent, scary books.  And, it's also a true mystery with a strong  who-done-it plot; and the romance is quite sensual.  Partners in Crime is  one of Ms. Stuart's lighter stories.  It's about a lawyer who is mistaken  for a criminal, and the woman who hires him to do a little thieving.  The  romance is quite marvelous; the two leads are both headstrong and  determined.  Now or Never would be a real treasure for any romance reader  to have!	1999-10-31

Sometimes, after working all day, I need quick stories to read.  This book is perfect for those occasions.  The stories by all three authors have just  the right amount of scares and romance!  Dark Journey, by Anne Stuart is  probably the best of the 3, simply because of originality.  Only the  talented authors could write a story about death, and make it a romance.   Read this book anytime, for scares, vampires, and even a  &quot;romantic&quot; grim reaper!	1999-10-28

I thought to myself, why haven't I been reading Ms. Barnett.  Somewhat into  the story, I thought I discovered &quot;why&quot;.  There is absolutely no  realism to this book.  Sophie's behavior would never have been tolerated by  any type of royalty, or even medieval parent.  And, then Sophie hides from  Tobin; she has a stint with pigs, juggling with a troupe,(naturally, she  passes out witha a  bump on the head) after cutting her hair to spike-like  lengths---Isn't it a rather large coincidence that she happens to land in  Tobin's arms from a tree.  Must have been a small world they were in!  And  then the Sophie &quot;battle&quot; scenes....all I can say is Sophie  learned very fast, how to best skilled warriors!  And, for that spike-like  hair to be flowing down her back again, after only months had passed.... I  guess some of us wish our hair would grow that fast.  It's too bad.  The  premise of the story was good; Tobin and his problems interesting.  But in  order to add humor and probably &quot;feminism&quot; to the plot--it became  a very far-fetched story!	1999-10-27

This one, is not exactly  an adventuresome book; and then, to make it  longer...The plot was an original; the characters were interesting.   However, the book lacked spice and romance.  I just didn't feel it was  there.  So much good, is written about Ms. Putney's books; but boredom will  not encourage a reader, no matter how good the writer.	1999-10-27

Ms. Chance has always been one of my favorite authors; have at least 2 of her books as keepers in my personal collection. This is the first book of  hers that I didn't like at all!  It's too slow and sad a book, didn't  really have much to say, and I really disliked the heroine.  And, Ms.  Chance, where's the romance? the love scenes?  I'm not sure how the heroine  ends up with her answers, by the end of the book.  Ms. Chance has never  been a writer of sensual romance; but she writes a good love scene--when  she writes them.  I just can't think of anything positive to say about this  book; and I wish I could.	1999-10-26

Every time I read it, I feel I could read it again.  The ending is the type that brings happy tears to  your eyes.  You are on a rollercoaster with Anthony and Fleur--and it's a  wonderful ride.  Sensual, romantic, adventurous---everything you could look  for in a historical romance.  Oh Ms. Grahame, I concur, write again!	1999-10-25

How did he get his reputation?  I kept waiting to see the man  behind the reputation--and all I saw was a strong heroine, with a weak  hero.  She showed more of a rakish personality than he did!  Also didn't  like all the tangents the story went on--feminism, racism, relgious  freedom.  One theme would have been plenty.  Why did I give it 3 stars.   Barbara Samuel's writing skills do shine thru!	1999-10-25

Is it a romance, romantic suspense, ghost story, glitz?  Who done it?  I didn't  care; the girl was long gone!  Too many coincidences and stilted dialogue  added to my dislike of this story.  Then, there's the so-called love  scenes; added I'm sure to give the author's fans a fair dose of her  trademark sensuality.  I'd pass on this!	1999-10-25

Viv and Rafe come alive as few other characters do in any kind of fiction.  This is a dark story; full of adventure, action and intrigue. The sensuality is very strong; and the scenes are frequent.  But, the scenes  never seem out of place or too much, because they are so much a part of the  vibrant leads. The action scenes are somewhat gory; 1586 London is  described in detail. However, if you like a dark  book that keeps you  turning pages; this book has it all!	1999-10-22

For the mystery reader, this book has a mystery which will fool you; even though there's a clue practically on the first page!  The romance  is very iffy to begin with, then heats up as you turn the pages.  Molly is  a solve-it-herself heroine.  No cutesy, feisty person--but a person who's  understandably freightened when she wakes up in a hospital without her  memory.  Patrick, is eliminated as a suspect almost immediately; but is  still an enigma.  What is the relationship between the two?  You'll wonder  that the whole book, meanwhile enjoying a beautiful but scary country  estate (Wintersedge), jealous lovers,  weird relatives, and others.  Each  character adds his or her own spot to the story.  Very entertaining!  And  don't be fooled by the sweet cover.  This book is as dark as it is light.	1999-10-19

Out of the 4 stories, only Small's was what I would call erotic. And, there was certainly no romance in the story!   Johnson's section was just boring, and not worth reading and I didn't finish it. Devine's story might  have been sexy, had there been some romance to it.  Schone's story was  somewhat slow and not what I would call erotic.  An unusal sex act for a  male and female pair of lovers, is a far cry from eroticism to me!   However, the story made the best stab at being a romantic tale.  All four  authors are talented enough to have done better.	1999-10-16

Already, on pg. 32, I was entranced by the words of Anne Stuart.  Simon was in my house, and I was  lost in his and Alys's story.  He's the dark, tortured hero, but with  touches of humor and humanity.  She's meek and timid,or so she says.  But  Alys never hesitates to throw herself in harm's way to protect her sister;  and eventually Simon.  This is a medieval that has it all. Action, humor,  sweet sensuality, and two romances.  And the best thing about Anne's  secondary romance, is that it never takes anything away from the main  story; the romance and adventure of Alys and Simon of Navarre.	1999-09-20

She used to write serious, sexy, well-plotted books.  Now she writes so-called romantic comedies.  Lady Emma and Kenny, are two very superficial people.  Add to that,a lack of plot, a lack of sexual tension, and there's nothing  for me to enjoy about this book.  I can read about Texas in textbooks, or  even in SEP's previous books.

Susan has written great romantic suspense in the past--Exposure, On Thin Ice, Present Danger. All are worth rereading.  This one wasn't  worth finishing.  There is no suspense, no romance, just &quot;cute&quot;  sexual byplay.  Hot or not, it's not a book I'd recommend.	1999-09-01
