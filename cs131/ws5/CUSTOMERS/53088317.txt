Both Mr. Gilbert and his American twin Mr. Ambrose, prolific and omnipresent in the history stacks,  produce such a volume of paper that is quite impossible to be the work of  just single men. <br />Thinking more that in Mr. Gilbert's case, he has an  orchestra of researchers and copy writers who proffer up near finished  work, which he then edits into his style by removing the individuating  writing of others. This can lead to some amusing and albeit depressing  errors, some in fact and others in grammar. <br /> 1) page  84.  Colon,  Panama is and has always been on the Caribbean  coast of that  isthmus.<br /> 2) page 102. The bottom third of this page is  incomprehensibly garbled.  <br />Such blunders early on cast a shadow over  the following thousand pages. They are the kind of technical errors that  show a writing project out of control, pressured by time and budget; the  author's interest distracted as he becomes more of a manager and less of a  writer.  <br />Book Mills have huge advantages over the lone author; massively  parallel, coordinated  and detailed subject analysis, cross-proof reading,  platoons of research assistants spanning the globe on a single subject  hunt. And the authors ability to off-load both interest and responsibility  when his eye wanders.   <br />The down-side of the economies of scale are   that the writing stops; the slow consideration of every sentence, the  amusement of word play,  the passion that forces every detail into  perfection. Good-bye to all that.   Still, Mr. Gilbert's last  responsibility is to read the book that has his name on it. <br />This is not  the last nor the first of Mr. Gilbert's work that I have; but in stumbling  as a amateur historian over poor quality here,  I shall regard each  subsequent page and volume  with some skepticism.  Put this book up on your  shelf next to the volumes of another author cut by the same sword: David  Irving.	2000-05-04

First thing, she is run into a clamp chute and fertilized by a bovine  Grover Cleveland. Can you imagine?  After you stop laughing at  the idiocy  you realize that  this novel is all  down hill from there.  And it takes  real fortitude  to force your way  through the 500 pages of empty  childish  conceit.  Searching  for just   one  responsible  adult.  Again. In one afternoon she declines  a marriage  proposal, is blackmailed with the life of her daughter, and witnesses an  act of industrial sabotage--- what  does she do to relieve the stress;   She--goes---shopping!<br />The author  serves up a menu,  all victims: child  care, homelessness, immigrant  ignorance, emigration,  abortion, poverty,  racism, classism, elitism, socialism, communism,  gay and lesbianism,  unionism, urban crime, environmentalism; she has taken all the concerns of  the present  era and dumped them on a past age, conveniently  dead and  silent. She paints them all with the wide and soft brush of fo-concern,   just  a passing  notice  that the author  is nothing  if not P.C.; but  failing any cogent  analysis, any  attention  beyond the juvenile, any   adult  consideration whatsoever.    When she cannot  triangulate  a  comfortable position between the conflicts, she blames somebody else;  how  easy, how simple, how liberal, how Clintonesque.  She has made  a spectrum  of historical figures (all white males) simplistically  evil so that her  characters  can be better  victims; her obligation to the core of liberal  victimology. Chapter  after chapter, like so many serial episodes  of  \\"Ricki Lake\\", it's  a show , but  there  is no duty,  there  is no  responsibility,  there  is no conscience.   There  is only  the chatty ,  the vacant, the blas√©, the self-important.<br />I once attended a university  lecture on the regional political conflicts  that  developed into W.W.II;   the  speaker ( another  female) held up as her reference  Herman Wouk's  \\"TheWinds  of War\\",  a simplistic, easy  novel but her required historical  reading.   The danger  of badly  written historical novels, beyond being   easy and simple, are that their naive messages, appealing to the ignorant,  have a way of becoming  fact. That somewhere  an adult  is holding this  book up to audience  of young  people  saying  \\"history\\".  That  in a rich,  selfish, complacent  and lazy  society  the worst, as in any toilet bowl,  has a way of floating to the top.    \\"City  of Light\\"  floats.	2000-03-29

Let's limit the field to only those characters  known world-wide by just one name. Certainly  Hitler will be included within that group; more than some are,  like him,  at least mass murderers. So our century, more  sanguinary  than others seems to bestow  fame  upon  those who manage  to  climb  to the top of a mountain of corpses.   After the atrocity,   the  question  is always Why?  As if in finding the full, complete  and verified  explanation  would in some way soothe  our concerns  about  our world  and  ourselves. If we found the curriculum  and study guides  and the  library   and plans  for the Holocaust  Management  Business School ;  would we be  better  or worse off for knowing?  Mr. Rosenbaum  in looking  for Hitler  interviews  25 \\"explainers\\" a  collection of  historians, psychohistorians,   pundits, philosophers, all manner  of academia  with grant  money  to  spend and time to blow  a few years in Europe.  What  he finds are cliques,  and groups  in trench  warfare against  each  other, sniping  in the  professional journals, tossing press-release  grenades ; squadrons  of  publisits  carpet  faxing the media. <br />One explainer  is combing  all the  existent  photographs   of  early  20th century Vienna looking for just   one protean  image: Freud, Mahler  and Hilter walking  arm in arm on the  Ringstrasse.  If we had that  photo would  the  6 Million  rest  easier?    Would  it stop or start another  50 years of Hilter books?<br />One  dillusional explainer, a former literature student, parses  every Hitler  speach looking for \\"code-words\\" by  which Hitler communicated secret    messages to his followers.  Not finding them  doesn't  mean that Hitler  only meant  what he said; on the contrary , the very absence  of  \\"code-words\\" is  evidence  that  the secret  communications  were  made.   Go figure.  It is the lack of specific  commands  and orders that drive  this explainer and others to read between lines and words; finding just  what  they want. Has the same Rorschach  technique  been applied to  others  on our list, Gandhi, Einstein, Stalin, Mao, Freud, Churchill?  Does  it   tell us more about  the subject  or the \\"explainer\\"?  More  about  ourselves?<br />We meet the goofballs you already know , Goldhagen and his  friend Irving; but the real surprise,  the crank that makes  both  look  like a thoughtful, meticulous, professional historians,  is the unfortunate   Herr Lanzmann.  He has all the answers because  only he is allowed to ask  the questions; all other explainers  are revisionists, justifiers and  deniers...Nazis.  He is the true \\"paper  Eichmann\\" whose  work is to  destroy  all other  analysis, comment  and opinion;  a  Fascist  with a  small  `f'  that  only  Adolf could  hug. Has the community of explainers   accepted into their  fold a Hitlerian  character; hysterical  in his  eliminationist  and  exclusionary  rhetoric?  Are they  afraid of him?   Will they continue to allow  his rant?      <br />It seems to me that  Rosenbaum in bashing around on the world tour of Hitler Studies has  produced two things; the first is the best biography of Hitler yet , not  the tactical  military  dictator, but the person behind the image;   incomplete  but compressive.  The second  is a review of the convoluted and   politically  charged  community  of explainers; those with agendas and  those unbiased, but all engaged in an activity that insures , after a half  a century,   that Hitler lives.<br />Put this book up on your shelf next to  it's only comparable  volume: \\"The Hitler of History\\".	1999-10-12

They tell you nothing of what is inside.<br /><br />Ms. Sereny is  primarily an interviewer; in her book &quot;Into That Darkness&quot;  she  produces a biography of Franz Stangl, Kommandant of the Triblinka  extermination   Camp in central Poland in 1943.  For most of us he and his  deathcamp rank at the bottom  if not define human atrocity.  Ms. Sereny   talks to Stangl not a journalist or reporter but as a therapist, and  for  Stangl this is both the first time and the last time &quot;I never talked  to anyone like this&quot;; he dies hours afterwards.<br /><br />Her picture of  Stangl is of a man struggling with his own past behavior, so conflicted in  his inability to reconcile his personal concessions; he has developed into  two men.  One in continuous  battle with the other, irreconcilable in their  differences, both authors of the same criminal acts from inside one mind.   We see both Herr Stangls  parse, compartmentalize, excuse, avoid, dodge,  stonewall and counter-accuse  in a twisted effort to find a logic that   will allow them to inhabit  that  one mind.<br /><br />Just that Stangl  is  twisted in conflict at all means that there was in him a spark of  recognition of both good and evil as separate things.  Moral and immoral,  criminal and civil, humane  and inhumane;  that spark of conscience still  glows enough to allow  a dim and tardy discrimination.  That faint light  surrounded by all that darkness is what tears  him into two personalities;   its the only way he can reconcile  the behavior of both; its the only thing  that keeps him from becoming an animal. Ms. Sereny finds that animal and  turns its slowly in that dim light and destroys both the Stangls.<br /><br />A  third of this book hangs the heavy  cloak of complicity squarely on the  shoulders of the Vatican. She is not too kind to Simon Wiesenthal  either.<br /><br />Put this book up on your shelf next to Arendt.	1999-04-29

For those of us whom have read Macdonald's &quot;Somme&quot;, Tuchman's matchless &quot;August 1914&quot;, or Cecil's &quot;Flowers of Battle&quot;, this book is a cumulation and a closure. Having done the  preparatory reading  of the histories and the literature of W.W.I; with  O'Shea we follow his journey into the geography of both.O'Shea is a walking  tour of literature, history, geography, politics, tactics, and culture;  with many a comment directed toward us the grandchildren of those so  twisted in self-destruction that it  is still in evidence on the landscape  eight  decades after; it is still reflected in the politics of today. His  is a walking commentary, with reference to  and critique of every social  aspect that contributed to and resulted from the Western Front. O'Shea's  observation is clear. The losers in war list their dead individually, so  the endless drone of the recitation of the names of the victims will mask  the names of the criminal.The statistics of the Great War are still  staggering: From the Battle of the Somme, 73,412 bodies unidentified,  600,000 known dead just on the Allied side, one battle. From the Battle of  the Argonne,  more shot and shell fired in 72 hours than in the entire US  Civil War. From Verdun, 60,000 French dead in 60 minutes.

It is an exploration of an archaic vocabulary and a lost culture  using a storytellers skill that was last used by Homer. The story and plot  are irrelevant other than McCarthy has fashioned a group of crudely  chiseled characters on a wide wide horizon of fine resolution; and he moves  the characters across a blasted panorama in a pounding and relentless  drama. There are portions of the prose that are so perfect in assembly and  content that, like the Bible and just a half dozen other documents in  English, they should be read aloud.<br /> In the thousands of books that I  will read in the second half of my life I hope to find one more  to equal  this Blood Meridian.Put this book up on a shelf next to Homer, Cervantes,  Melville, and Joyce.	1999-01-20

Drakes first edge in his  line of work was that he sailed to the West Indies with shallow water boats  on board his transatlantic ships, in partially assembled form or complete  'ready for action' towed behind.  His second edge was that he had the  sponsorship of the Queen of the Realm, E1.  With The  Royal Patronage, like  007 he could do whatever, no problem.  Let Sir Fancis test his new maritime  tactics in the shallow lagoons and bays of the Caribbean against the hated  Espanish, if he succeeds everybody's rich, if he fails he's dead. In the  early years Sr. Francis exploited every advantage; particularly the huge  differences in time and distance between the government of Spain and its  Western claims. In  Francis' time those regions barely qualified as any  governmental area, so far from  authority and management they were.   Happening upon a likely victim,  our pirate simply cut a deal with the site  governors, the treasure caravan leaders, and the treasure ship captains in  transit. Francis took most but left enough to make the employees rich.  He  cast off with fair regards for all people, and  everybody  involved looked  forward to the &quot;Good Pirates&quot; return next season. Philip of Spain  was more circumspect. Over a period of years he established his authority  via clear management lines of responsibility and procedures for the  transportation of loot and filthy lugar.  After the Spanish King  consolidated his realm, Sr. Francis days were done. The Spanish had yet  another use for our pirate hero. It was Spanish Literature that was first  to elevate Sr. Francis  to the place of folk hero, epic warrior, and  national poltergeist.  For a generation whisper of &quot;El Dragon&quot;  was sufficient to warn every child to bed and more importantly every  shippingmanager, captain and dock clerk to do his best for King and kind.	1998-11-17

The book presents a few maps poorly drawn without  relief, detail, contrast or clarity;  primitive  and in every aspect uninformative.  It makes this reader sick to follow the detailed accounts of 3 armies  maneuvering against 2 opposing forces in a complex geography; where each  commander is trying to maximize every geographical advantage, and be  referred to the included maps that actually detract from the clarity of the  story.  Every military historian knows that in a conflict between two  forces the geography is always the third combatant. Nowhere more so than in  the last half of the US Civil War where the minority forces were in a  protracted defensive struggle. Shermans only equal, Joe E. Johnston, was a  master of defensive topography; all the more reason to bless Sherman's  biography with maps worthy of both  characters and the conflict.  Hirshson,  if he understood this, let his editor proffer maps that are  &quot;cute&quot; rather than useful. In reading this book you should take  along your copy of the &quot;West Point Atlas of American Wars  Vol.1.&quot;, or refer back to Mr. Foote's boatanchor for topographic  resolution.

Second  only to securing the safety of his nation Mr. Churchill, historian,  essayist, biographer, and critic, had to produce his version first. Of the  major personalities of  that era Churchill  was the only one who wrote; who  got his version to the world.  Irving's biography  shows why Churchill had  to write.The book is not for the casual  reader. The assumption is that the  reader has a few WW2 histories, European geography, and British politics  well  understood. Irving's sole effort is to sift through the fine details  of the accepted history and find contradictions, new events, and additional  interpretations of the facts.  His book is so packed with detail, all  contexturally suspended on a web of assumption and  conclusion,  that  without some background you will  miss  the astonishing story. Irving is  not afraid  to surmise given some  facts and not afraid  to stretch to  obvious conclusions, he could be dead wrong but at least he's got it out  there.  Irving has gone deeper into the details and  found both more  complicated personalities and events,  and having found new and startling  information he can interpret them the way he pleases.  His Biographies are  not flattering, on first take, but by adding new and counter-characteristic  details,  Irving makes  Churchill  more real, more fallible, and his  accomplishments all  the more extraordinary.  Irving is not shy of adding  a black-eye where the documents support it,  and he (Irving) has taken a  few slaps for doing so; but only because he is emphatic in relating what he  has found, and dares his critics to prove the obverse.<br />Irving is good for  us readers of history. You should find the best historical writing at least  controversial, if not outrageous.

Reisner reports the greed, ignorance and arrogance of government agencies without a  plan nor a policy nor guidance nor responsibility. How would we be living now,  had the COE, USBR or anyone in government had any kind of thoughtful water policy other than dam everything?<br />Few people are going to read this for fun. Researchers, water, hydroelectric and agricultural  pros,  folks with their own article or book in mind, political historians; all these are going to use this as a reference.  Readers of purpose that may check the bibliography first or at least keep going back to it as they notice items in the text.  The problem is that the Penguin edition is missing the bibliography for chapter 8.  You may want to check another edition to make sure you've got the complete package.<br />If you live west of the 100th meridian, drink water and read; the co! ! mplete book should be on your shelf.

Now hear this!<br />Ready for a true life sea shanty?<br />Follow now our hard living, hard loving, and hard drinking Swordfishermen as they set out to the stormy NorthAtlantic in search of the last remaining and elusive Xiphias gladius.  Watch our intrepid fishermen orchestrate their on-board fax-machines, satellite photos, observation aircraft, and Doppler sonar to locate and catch each remaining individual fish. Witness their women pine and worry  themselves into alcohol lubricated neurosis waiting in port. Marvel at the  Fishermans Co-op aggressive extermination of the species, and equally aggressive search for Federal subsidies.  Sortie with the National Guard Air Sea Rescue (your tax dollars at work) when our heroes are too drunk to find the radio for their hourly report.   <br />&quot;The Perfect  Storm&quot; should have remained a short story.  You can hear the editor enthuse Mr. Junger to &quot;fill it out&quot; with tales of Ninja air-sea rescue types,  their helicopters and satellite communications, and nerdy NOAA types with their  computer models.  But  after our heroes die it is pretty much a Tom Clancy gee-whiz, techo-display.  That's just  what a young author needs to get his first book turned into a &quot;treatment&quot; and that into a  screen-play and that into a monster Christmas movie... and you can select the cast.  <br />It's a fast book. You will read it in one sitting, I am sure that the movie will be just as fast and just as anemic. I see in the reviews that this book is compared many times to  Krakauer's  twin best sellers;  that is to be expected from readers who choose their books strictly off the Newspapers List. In the end it is a book about foul weather.   Those of us interested in shipping and ocean survival  will defer to  the long out of print &quot;Posted Missing&quot; by Alan Villers, detailing big ships in big trouble;  J.McPhee's &quot;Looking for a Ship&quot;, solely for his eerie 4 page account ofall the ships lost in one month worldwide;  and  the ocean survival epic of this century &quot;Endurance&quot; by A. Lansing, 1915. Junger is not even close to any of these writers in subject or skill. <br />Put this book up on your shelf next to Clancy or Crighton.<br />That is all! That is all!	1998-05-26

Lee Harvey Oswald walks into your living room sits down and says &quot;Hi, Y'all&quot;.<br />The Assassination, even now after 34 years, has no closure.  Into the information gap run Mr. DeLillo, Mr. Mailer and dozens if not hundreds of writers, film directors, columnist, and TV producers.  The Assassination remains a cottage industry whose customers are the best of us and also the worst of us.<br />Mr. DeLillo's effort has the advantage of all the intervening years of facts and fiction between November 1963 and now;  and he has fashioned a plausible Mr. Oswald and clearly plausible characters surrounding the Southern U.S. in 1963. <br />What you will get here is a Lee Harvey Oswald that is so close that you can smell him, you can also smell agents and low-lifes by the dozens for whom assassination, be it in Haiti, Chile, Cuba or Texas was just another assignment directed by &quot;people of trust&quot;.  Mr. DeLillo  produces an environment that like Le Carre', he shows how an image is reflected by rumor in  a mirror image of a mirror held by a triple agent holding 3 other mirrors. <br />In the end you will comfort yourself in the &quot;fiction&quot; classification of the book, comfort yourself that you have read the &quot;truth&quot;, comfort yourself that DeLillo is just guessing, comfort yourself that DeLillo is exactly right. <br />Put this book up on your shelf right next to your copy of S.Hunter's &quot;Point of Impact&quot;.	1997-12-01

The Australian forces are given a rare forum to explain their contribution to the Pacific conflict; deservedly characterized by the author as &quot;the best land army of the war&quot;. It was the AIF that patented guerrilla warfare, before the American material tsunami, in its most brutal, savage, and murderous aspect. Perhaps it is only the ANZAC's that had the most to loose in a Japanese victory. They clearly fought on the personal and intimate basis of hatred and survival.<br />   This is a rare '90's book that clearly focuses on the Japanese military as a demonic cult of death. That military managed an engine of war that would not accept conditional defeat, and insured the unnecessary deaths of millions of people.  Battle histories are usually one-sided efforts because the loosing side is typically dead; in this conflict the Japanese military was exterminated in total by own their design.  This book contains the recollections of dozens of combat veterans who quickly adapted to a new form of warfare in a punishing environment.<br />Put this book up on your shelf next to your &quot;The Pacific War&quot; by J.

Far from Frank Norris or Jack London or Sinclair Lewis or authors intent to describe the homesteading life; there is no manifesto here.  There is no bright definition between the good and evil, nor an epic struggle against the land and climate,  nor a guerrilla war of one class against another.  All the folks here get on rather well considering that two of the three women characters are murders and all of the men are but domesticated farm animals.  More (or less) the book lacks even the basic description that  would link the reader to the land; no colorful seasonal changes,  no waves of migrating birds, no surf on the shore, no  simple enjoyment of the earth as the day begins.  No Steinbeck here. No Barry Lopez, no Ted Morgan.  We have here the novel of the ruminants; grubbing, rutting, and wondering what it is all about.  Put this book up in your medicine cabinet; try to read 20 pages whenever you cannot sleep.	1997-11-30

If you have ever wondered how those most beautiful Eskimo sculptures and prints have found their way to your local gallery; this book tells you how. <br /> Mr. Houston was the first artist to recognize and search out the Inuit artforms and   to  deliver them to the art markets  &quot;outside&quot;.   In every detail, name by name, you can read about the  Inuit art culture from the very first  stone figures and bone scluptures, to the  latest prints. <br />Second this is a book about  Arctic.  Adventure on a epic scale.  Mr. Houstons' honeymoon was one of the very few trips from east to west across Baffin Island by sled.  Mr and Mrs. Houston spent  years in the Arctic living in the Inuit way; both their sons spoke  Inuktitut in preference to English and preferred raw seal meat to... well that  was all there was to eat. <br />Sadly there are in this book no prints of  the Inuit art, nor photos of the artists, nor any example of the art described in the text.  For all the journeys by sled, boat, plane, and on foot there  are no suitable maps.  For a book about a culture that is so completely linked to  geography, there are no maps for the reader to follow  nor plates for the art lover to love.  <br />The most astonsihing event of the book occurs on page 9.  A very young Mr. Houston steps off of  a plane in the Hudson's Bay Arctic, looks around,  and flatly refuses to live any place else;  He stays for 15 years.  <br />You can add Mr. Houston to the list with Barry Lopez, William Vollmann , Farley Mowat, and John McPhee;  thoes  writers that get the Arctic Expericence	1997-08-14

In the same paragraph she/he can be the disgruntled fellow officer and a breath later the wife of that same affronted officer, enraptured by the demon Admiral  Fisher;  who has just put her husband down.  Fisher was a man who would destroy many a career without compunction , but in such a way that  the victims would name their first male child after him.  Go figure.  <br />Winston-O-Files will find little here but two characters so similar, so individual, and so revolutionary, that they could have been twins.  <br />Ms. Morris writes this book in the second person taking us into Admiral Fishers quarters on board the &quot;Renown&quot; and letting the effusive and entertaining and somewhat  comedic  Admiral  lead us on a tour of his life.  Morris is clearly in love with Jacky and through attention and  sensitivity writes a gripping and compassionate biography. <br />Wedge this book in next to your  Manchester and Churchill and, oh'ya,  your James Morris	1997-08-11
