Hundreds of Questions You'd Only Ask a Doctor After Your Third Martini	Books	3	7	9	N	N	Good content, annoying presentation	While the questions and answers provided in this book are entertaining, the overall work is hurt by too many attempts at humor that simply get in the way of our enjoyment. <br /> <br />The array of questions is pretty thorough given the book's size, and there are some genuinely funny answers.  However, when the authors try too hard at humor, the book suffers.  Too many times it seems forced, especially during the sections that are supposed to cover dialogue between the authors.  All the talk about their proclivities towards acting like frat boys also grows stale quickly.  What saves this book is that the questions they ask are easily relatable, as I'm sure we've all wondered about many of them. <br /> <br />Finally, a note about the battle over \\"padded\\" postings that seems to be raging here.  If you look through the first several pages of reviews, you'll notice several from a \\"J.Andrews,\\" mostly titled \\"Good Times.\\"  It does make me wonder about the validity of some of these reviews.	2005-09-13
US	49565872	R1IXAID1PTBBB8	1401337031	844957384	ESPN College Football Encyclopedia: The Complete History of the Game	Books	3	37	41	N	N	Great resource, but not without faults	I'd really echo what the first reviewer wrote, that this is a valuable book hurt by some poor editing.  And since this publication is meant to be a complete and authoritative source for college football, those mistakes detract from its overall value. <br /> <br />The capsule looks at each program are great.  Not only can you look back at scores and performance from past years, but the leaders for each team are a useful resource.  It's fun to look at certain schools, to see how their fortunes have risen and fallen over long periods of time.  The historical polls are also enjoyable to look at, for much the same reason, seeing which teams have stuck around near the top for long periods of time, while others come and go. <br /> <br />The essays are also interesting, although I would have liked a few more of them.  I don't think they need to give a comprehensive history of the college game (those already exist), but examining certain trends or particular eras/teams would have been a nice addition. <br /> <br />This book really does fill a niche for the sports fan, and even with some errors this book is well worth the price.  However, I think that any great reference work should be completely authoritative, and that's where this one falls short.  A great book, but one whose next edition should really be a 5-star effort.	2005-09-02

However, it takes no more than a few pages to realize that O'Connor is not falling into any such trap.  Instead, he has produced one of the best sports to come out in recent years, and one of the best basketball books I've ever read. <br /> <br />I'm sure that even the casual sports fan is aware of Sebastian Telfair, given the magazine covers he graced during his senior year of high school basketball.  Knowing a good subject when he sees it, O'Connor decided to follow the Telfair story on a personal level, talking to ST throughout his final year, as well as having discussions with everyone around him - and I mean everyone, including family, friends, teammates, high school and college coaches, ADs, scouts, etc.  What we get is an incredibly detailed portrait of what it felt like to be Telfair during an absolutely crazy time in his life. <br /> <br />While athletes are portrayed as vain and greedy, Telfair actually comes off very well in this book.  It's not that O'Connor unfairly keeps him above the fray, it's just that Telfair seems like a genuinely good person who happens to be an incredibly gifted and hardworking athlete.  The same, however, can't be said of his family.  His parents, especially, come across as greedy and self-centered, always looking at how the success of Sebastian (as well as Stephon Marbury and Jamel Thomas before him) might help them out of their tough financial situations.  Same goes for plenty of non-family members, who seem in many cases to feel that they're entitled to some kind of kickback for having helped Telfair get to where he is today. <br /> <br />The writing is smooth and descriptive, never becoming bogged down too much with O'Connor's subjective views or wasted words.  It's like reading a piece of fiction at times, given the fact that so many invovled come across as characters someone would have created if they didn't already exist.  This is a masterpiece of sports writing, a truly great book, and I would recommend it to anyone, even those without a great interest in basketball. <br />	2005-08-05

They'll never be able to match what BP has done for baseball fans, simply because football doesn't have the depth of stats found in baseball, but they're getting better. <br /> <br />One thing I like about this year's edition is that their player comments seem to have a little more thought put into them than in year's past.  In previous editions, they've felt like a hurried add-on to the stats, but they seem more able to stand on their own this time around. <br /> <br />A continuing problem is the seeming lack of an editor, or even someone to make sure that player names are spelled correctly.  Really, this is something that shouldn't happen, given that the whole point of your book is to judge these players.  It happens on the cover, and it happens several times throughout the book.  There are also a number of obvious grammatical errors that should have been caught.  They don't take away from the points made by the writers, but they certainly don't help the publication seem very professional. <br /> <br />This isn't something I would think of only for the fantasy fan.  I'd consider this important also for those fans looking to learn a little more about certain players, as well as serving as a quick reference resource during the upcoming season.  And for fantasy fans, I hope this year's projections at certain positions are better than last year - as an example, Jeff Garcia was ranked near the top of the QB listings last season, and we all know how close he actually came to that!  It's always tough to predict performance, but here's hoping they do it this time, considering it's a big part of why this book exists.	2005-08-04

The same goes for coaches, whose careers stats are also included.  For this year's expected crop of rookies, college stats are included. <br /> <br />There is no analysis, only statistics, which is to be expected from the Register.  What makes this publication so valuable is that, even with many stats available on the Internet, this is still the fastest and easiest way to find what you're looking for when it comes to football statistics. <br /> <br />Along with the 2005 NFL Record and Fact Book, this is a book that football fans should have readily available during the NFL season.	2005-07-26

And while it's not worth the months-long hype that went on before its release, it's still a good read. <br /> <br />The different types of people - travelers, harlequins, members of the Brethren - are interesting, and the story itself is simple but enjoyable.  And I'm hoping that the momentum of this book can carry into a second effort. <br /> <br />However, for all of its good qualities, this book is somewhat of a mess.  First off, there are simply too many repetitive sections - for example, how many times do we need to be reminded of the Harlequins' bravery, or of the fact that the Brethren really like order in their lives?  And further, there are some glaring editing errors, including a scene in which the wrong brother's name is given.  I can forgive some small points, but using the wrong name?  I know this isn't really the fault of the author, but shouldn't the editors have done a better job considering how hard they've been pushing this title? <br /> <br />I'd still recommend this one, but I'm really hoping for a tighter effort in the second book of this series.	2005-07-26

Instead, it's a no-nonsense guide to the food we eat, one that examines caloric intake, fats, etc., without laying on the platitudes found in many such guides. For years, Wllett has been emphasizing the importance of avoiding trans fats, an essential point that the rest of the nutrition world seems finally to have caught up with.  <br /> <br />If you're looking for sound and reasonable advice about your diet, this is easily the best book around. You might not drop 10 pounds in 2 weeks, but it can have a definite positive impact on long-term health.  <br />	2005-07-25

And while it may not quite measure up to the first, it's nonetheless an excellent and fun read. <br /> <br />This time around, Dexter is forced to do a lot of biding his time.  His nemesis, Sergeant Doakes, has taken his suspicion of Dexter to another level, going so far as to trail our poor serial killer around during his non-working hours.  But while that eliminates some of Dexter's activities, it also provides the book with some great humor.  Because of Doakes' suspicions, Dexter is forced to make himself look more \\"normal\\" by spending additional time with girlfriend Rita and her children.  The funniest parts of this novel come in seeing Dexter's efforts to seem like an average guy, and the feelings he has about playing this part. <br /> <br />Dexter is eventually freed from these chains because of one Dr. Danco, a gentleman who seems to share with Dexter some traits, notably the ability to kill well.  Dexter is drawn into the case by his sister Deborah, and his involvement becomes more intense when Deborah's new boyfriend arises as a possible victim for Danco.  Danco's exploits are quite horrendous, making Dexter's look downright normal by comparison, and there are actually some pretty squeamish moments when the Doctor's victims are found. <br /> <br />I don't think it's fair to say that this second book is any less funny, dark, or enjoyable than the first.  I guess it's just difficult to follow such an excellent first novel with an equally outstanding effort, if only because the originality is no longer there. <br /> <br />Regardless, I believe that anyone who enjoyed Lindsay's first will do the same this time around.  Definitely one of the best works of fiction I've read so far this year, this is one I'd recommend highly.	2005-07-19

This year's publication also includes a new fantasy section, with projections given for players at the offensive slots.   <br /> <br />One of the more useful and interesting aspects of this book is a section titled, \\"Inside the Numbers.\\"  This is where a fan can find information about what players have the most TDs, yards, etc. over the past 2,3, and 4 seasons.  It's where you can learn that Torry Holt has 700 yards more receiving than TO over the past 4 seasons, but has reached the end zone 19 fewer times.  It also includes great esoteric information like a list of the coldest games in NFL history, or team records in games decided by a field goal or less over the past 35 seasons.  And for some of the league's superstars, there is a breakdown of their career performance against each team. <br /> <br />If there's one item that's obviously lacking, it's a register of all current players and their career stats.  However, including that info would turn an already 784-page long book into something much longer, and there are existing publications that provide those stats. <br /> <br />If you're someone who spends their Sundays in the fall and early winter settled on your couch with a remote control at the go, this is one you should own.  It's a fantastic reference source for the season, and it costs less than $12.  Again, this is an essential purchase, one I can't recommend highly enough.	2005-07-18

Dave gets involved in some trouble, sticks his nose where he probably shouldn't (usually involving a wealthy and important person), and uses his pitbull-like instincts to avoid letting go until he has resolved the problem. <br /> <br />The tale this time revolves around the almost-half-century long disappearance of a young prostitute named Ida, who had been befriended by Dave and his brother, Jimmie.  When the young woman's name is spoken by a dying man, the past is brought into the present, and Dave and Jimmie are soon on the hunt for Ida.  Of course, this being a Robicheaux book, they inevitably encounter all sorts of baddies while doing so, including the wealthy Chalon family, at least one of whom may have been involved. <br /> <br />As always, Robicheaux's writing is almost lyrical, and he can describe many of the same physical details he's covered in other novels without boring the reader.  Clete Purcell also appears, spicing things up with his brutal violence and strange wisdom.  And just to surprise us, Burke also throws in a very unexpected romantic involvement for Dave. <br /> <br />Burke is one of our best contemporary novelists, and this is another piece of proof towards that.  Anyone who has enjoyed past works from this series should like this one.	2005-07-12

With this latest, spun from Philadelphia Chickens, she's created another one that both parents and children will love. <br /> <br />Featuring a bunch of hippos playing on the beach, the song is an homage to our belly buttons.  Knowing the fascination that so many kids have with their navel, this one is sure to please.  The hippo illustrations are exactly what you'd expect from Boynton, and the rhymes are silly fun.  And anyone who reads this one will especially enjoy the hippo baby who can only say, \\"Bee-bo,\\" when referring to their belly button. <br /> <br />Boynton seems to have an amazing understanding and perception of exactly what young children will enjoy in a board book.  This is another winner, to add to an already extensive list of impressive works.	2005-07-08

Thankfully, while Tres' act might wear somewhat thin, his girlfriend Maia Lee is around to pick up the slack. <br /> <br />The premise involves the shooting of cop Ana Deleon, and its relation to a cold case from almost 20 years before.  Ralph Arguello, Ana's husband and Tres' friend, is an obvious and likely suspect, so it's up to Tres to help keep him free and to prove his innocence.  Given that the case also ties into the White family, San Antonio's largest crime family, Tres must also keep Ralph from their grasp. <br /> <br />While Tres' behavior might seem somewhat old hat to those who have read the other books in the series, Maia emerges as a character equal to Tres.  Her actions, both physical and otherwise, help the book through some weak spots.  Hopefully, this will keep the series going strong for a while. <br /> <br />As I said in the title, this certainly isn't the best effort of the series - I'd put it somewhere in the middle.  But I still think Tres, Maia, and the others have room to grow, and I think the series can sustain itself for a few more novels.  Riordan is one of our most undervalued contemporary crime/p.i. writers, and it would be great to see this series grow in popularity.	2005-06-29

What makes it so much fun is that the book can be used not only as a reading tool, but the words allow you to physically interact with your child.  When I talk about her \\"top side,\\" she'll give me her head to rub, and laugh when I do so.  Same with her bottom side - and with the \\"inside,\\" she'll even open her mouth so I can stick my finger inside. <br /> <br />I find that great books for really young children are difficult to find, so this has been a real treat.

Too many of the jokes just fall flat (you can almost hear the little drum kick after some of them), and some of them already feel dated.  There are some great lines, but they're unfortunately too few.   <br /> <br />Scheft, a former writer for David Letterman, now writes what I consider to be one of the weaker elements of SI - a humor column that isn't often funny.  I don't doubt that Scheft is funny, especially given the fact that Larry David sings his praises.  However, that humor just doesn't come through in this book, and much of it can seem monotonous. <br /> <br />I think this may have worked better if the book was shorter, given that they could have been more selective about choosing material.  Or perhaps they should have waited longer, until Scheft had enough quality jokes to justify the length of the book. <br /> <br />This is a fun book to flip through for a few minutes, but certainly not an essential read.	2005-06-23

While Saginor gives the reader plenty to talk about, I really think she pulls some punches when it comes to her relationship with her father. <br /> <br />The stories are just what most of us would picture, mostly dealing with drink, drugs and sex.  And while none of it probably should surprise us, given the setting, it's still jarring to read what kind of behavior the author is subjected to as a child.  Her early sexual activity with both men and women isn't surprising, either, but it's heartbreaking. <br /> <br />Like an earlier review mentioned, I think the author goes easy on her dad, a man who pretty much abandoned her to be raised by the motley collection of Playmates and hangers-on.  At the same time, given his own behaviors, maybe that was for the best. <br /> <br />An interesting book, but a sad one.  It might not surprise anyone, but it still makes for a good read.	2005-06-23

Lincoln quickly surmises that the attempt has something to do with what Geneva may know, but it's up to Rhyme, Sachs et al to figure out exactly what that means. <br /> <br />What seperates Deaver from many thriller writers is that he presents his characters as more than one-dimensional representations of good and evil.  As always, Rhyme is at times a jerk, besides being a brilliant investigator.  And while the person chasing Geneva is obviously bad, a great deal of time is spent on filling out his character, instead of just showing him as an evil monster. <br /> <br />I'd be shocked if anyone could figure out every twist that happens in this book, since there are a number of them.  It's a credit to Deaver that he can pull these tricks without losing the reader, or without cheapening his book.  As with the whole Lincoln Rhyme series, I'd highly recommend this one.	2005-06-23

For those who have read other anti-Hilary books, or who read the columns of many leading conservatives in the media, most of this will seem repetitive.  And I think there's still a good book - and a more balanced one - waiting to be written about Ms Clinton. <br /> <br />As with most of these books, your political viewpoint will undoubtedly affect your enjoyment of the book.  The left won't want to hear any of the valid criticisms, a fact that's already been proven by all the one-star reviews on here by people who probably haven't even read the dust jacket, much less the book itself.  If you lean towards the right, or if you're just a Hilary-hater in general, you'll likely enjoy reading about her supposed evil, scheming ways. <br /> <br />Klein's writing is good, even if some of what he writes seems unbelievable.  He tends to reach at times, but without that reaching this book wouldn't have generated such controversry.  This is just another average entry in a crowded field of books about political leaders, one not much better or worse than most of what is already out there.	2005-06-21

These interviews are very telling, and it's a great way to get a more \\"first-person\\" perspective.  When Shiflett injects his view, his opinions are obviously biased (although, to his credit, he doesn't try to pretend towards objectivity), so the interview format works well in balancing the book. <br /> <br />No church really comes off badly in this work, and the Baptists are the ones who are most surprising, coming off very well, especially given the portrayal the more left-leaning media often gives of them. <br /> <br />My biggest complaint about the book is that there's really no new ground broken.  Shiflett makes his points well, but this is stuff we've all heard before.  A more minor complaint would be the fact that, as the PW review mentions, there are some poor editing errors in the book - not just words, but getting names of people wrong.  Really, this is something that should have been caught. <br /> <br />While Shiflett makes his points clearly, it's unlikely that this books is likely to change many minds one way or the other.  Your existing religious beliefs are likely to be the greatest influencing factor in how you feel about this book.  As a middle-of-the-road type, I think he's done a pretty good job of getting a handle on a tough subject. <br /> <br />	2005-06-10

I'd read the review for this months ago in Kirkus, and my first thought was, \\"How is Hornby going to pull off a book around such an odd topic?\\"  Well, I should have known better than to worry, as Hornby pulls it off with humor and great flair. <br /> <br />As you probably already know, the plot involves 4 people who meet while preparing to jump to their deaths from a famous suicide spot.  Instead of doing so, they band together to form one of the strangest support group/families you'll ever read about. <br /> <br />I think many who read this one will feel bad about laughing out loud at certain passages, given the darkness of the subject.  However, the ability to make us do that, to be able to laugh at topics like death and suicide, is what makes Hornby a great writer.  Even in deadly serious situations, he's able to inject his wit and make us take things just a little bit lighter. <br /> <br />I've been waiting for this one, and it was well worth the wait.  Not only do I feel like my expectations and anxieties were met, but that they were easily surpassed.  I can't recommend this one highly enough.  With all the poor fiction that gets released every week, it's such a great feeling when a gem like this one comes along.	2005-06-08

However, I don't read Finder's novels because of their realism - he's a great escapist writer, and this novel is no exception. <br /> <br />I won't rehash the story, but suffice to say that it's tightly told, with little space wasted despite the fact that this one is somehwhat lengthy.  Nick Stratton is a sympathetic and believable protagonist, and most of the characters are fleshed out well by Finder.  His writing is, as usual, crisp, and he doesn't waste time on events unimportant to the story. <br /> <br />For anyone looking for a quick, exciting read that goes beyond a typical thriller, this one is a good choice.  It's not his best effort, but this is definitely another winner from Finder.	2005-06-08

With his latest, a story told from ending to beginning, he solidifies this reputation. <br /> <br />Unlike Ellis's earlier work, the story here is really secondary to the writing method.  The book begins with the stopping of a terrorist action, and the suicide of a woman, Allison Pagone, allegedly involved in the plot.  From there, the story moves backward in time, as the reader tries to figure out exactly what has happened, and why. <br /> <br />Initially, I really thought little would be revealed from the past that would have much of an impact on the book's beginning.  I thought most of it would be filler, just a device to allow Ellis to pull off a tricky piece of writing.  However, what we learn as the story goes backwards in time changes much of our perception about we've already read, and many readers will probably find themselves flipping back to re-read certain sections.   <br /> <br />I think many authors could write a book in this format, from the present through the past.  To Ellis's great credit, though, he does so while creating an excellent mystery, one that will have many scratching their heads until book's end.  I'd recommend any of Ellis's books, all of which have been great, and this one is no exception.	2005-06-01
US	49565872	R3K3ZSVZ06BUGA	0553382071	157538292	The Boys Are Back in Town	Books	4	0	2	N	N	Golden's best book yet	Chris Golden has written a number of page-turners for teens, and with this book he has finally done the same for adults. <br /> <br />The premise is an interesting one.  While back in his hometown for a high school reunion, Will James mentions Mike, a friend who he's yet to see at the gathering.  When another friend chastises him for joking about Mike, who apparently died in their senior year of high school, it begins a chain reaction of events that causes Will's memories to begin changing.  As Will's memories continue to change - and never for the better - he's forced to revisit a dark area of his own past, if he's to have any chance to correct everything that is now going wrong. <br /> <br />The prose, as usual with Golden, can be clunky at times.  I think this is a remnant of all those years of writing teen fiction, but it can be somewhat frustrating at times.  Fortunately, the story is more than good enough to overcome these shortcomings, and Golden does a great job of letting events unfold at a proper pace. <br /> <br />It's refreshing to read a horror/suspense book that doesn't simply recycle a plot we've seen a thousand times.  Golden has fashioned a winner, the best book he's written to date.  It's not classic lit, but it's definitely an excellent read.	2005-05-23
US	49565872	R124BYDU8BEF7V	1592131646	971364386	Rookies Of The Year	Books	3	1	2	N	Y	Great idea hurt by omissions and lack of criticism	I was really looking forward to this book as a way to become more familiar with the different players, and types of players, who had won the ROY award.  And while it serves well as an introduction to these players, its value is hurt by the author's too-positive, never-say-a-bad-word-about-anybody approach. <br /> <br />The division of players is interesting.  Instead of a simple chronological approach, they're divided by those who became HOFers, those who would also win an MVP award during their careers, those who became managers, those with short careers, and a catch-all section for the rest.  Each is given about 1-2 pages of discussion, along with some basic stats for their rookie year and career.  While not presenting the players chronologically is at first confusing, the approach turns out to be quite a good one. <br /> <br />My biggest criticism is that the author chooses too often to highlight only the positive stats for a player, while completely ignoring the negative.  Two examples of this - First, he makes a point of Rod Carew's fine 1979 ALCS, when he hit .412, yet fails to mention at all that Carew was 4-for-33 in his 3 other ALCS appearances.  He does the same type of selective inclusion with Orlando Cepeda.  Although stressing his great 1969 ALCS, where he hit .455, there's no mention that he was only a .207 postseaon hitter.  Now, I don't expect a heavy-handed, ultracritical approach, but some balance would be nice.  While there is some of this approach shown in the area dealing with the short-career guys, the book too often is almost hagiographic in its approach to certain players. <br /> <br />Finally, there are a few errors that should have been caught by the author or a fact-checker.  Again using Carew as an example, the author states that he hit 5 homers in 9 ALCS games with the Angels.  In reality, he never hit a postseason homer, and never even hit more than 3 homers in a season with the Angels! <br /> <br />This is an enjoyable, light book thatmany baseball fans should enjoy.  Just don't go into it expecting an authoritative, comprehensive review or analysis.	2005-05-19
US	49565872	R28HBLG19IV3PM	055338208X	142603019	Wildwood Road	Books	3	14	16	N	N	Excellent story, but with some shortcomings	Golden has taken an old tradition - the haunting of a man by a ghost - and given it a bit of a spin in his latest oferring. <br /> <br />Michael Dansky seems to have a close-to-perfect life - great job, good friends, a beautiful and intelligent wife.  However, it all falls apart once he becomes haunted, and it's up to him to put things back together.  What made this stand out a little is that Michael's haunting also endangers his wife, upping the ante for him to correct things. <br /> <br />The story is hurt by a couple of problems.  First, the characters of Michael and Jillian seem a little too perfect.  He smiles whenever he looks at her, they apparently never have arguments, their sex life is perfect, their friends and coworkers all love and admire them - maybe these couples really exist, but they don't make for sympathetic characters.  Secondly, there is a great deal of action in the novel, often at the expense of character development or the use of Golden's writing skills.  It's like the author was told to package everything under a certain number of pages, and the writing suffers. <br /> <br />Golden has written a lot of teen novels, and this often feels like one.  The story and plotting are excellent, but there's little use of literary devices or sections that depend more on literary skill than on action taking place.  It's still a good book, but not on the level of his previous effort (The Boys are Back in Town). <br /> <br />A fast read, but don't go into it with high expectations.	2005-05-18

However, my belief upon finishing is that, while the writing is definitely literary, this is hardly a page-turner.  Instead, it's just an average novel, one that I wouldn't consider a necessary read. <br /> <br />While the mystery surrounds a relic called the Stela of Paser, the book is really more of an examination of its protagonist, Walter Rothschild.  I know this has been compared by some to the Da Vinci Code, and that's unfair.  Dan Brown wrote a great book, but one that was simply a page-turner based on the mystery, with his characters really secondary in the story.  With this novel, Bondurant really focuses on his characters, with the events serving more as a backdrop. <br /> <br />Bondurant is certainly a good writer, but the story simply gets bogged down in parts.  I don't expect non-stop action, but it just felt like much more could have happened, and I believe that some of the focus on Rothschild could have been shifted to covering the novel's action. <br /> <br />Again, this certainly isn't a bad book, and I think Bondurant is a good writer.  However, I really feel that anyone going in hoping for a true page-turning literary thriller will be disappointed.	2005-05-02

My personal bias aside, though, this is an interesting book both in terms of the game, and in terms of the look inside the mind of a man considered one of the great managers of our generation. <br /> <br />This book will not impress the casual fan, or anyone reading it simply because they've like Bissinger's past work.  There's a ton of detail about baseball that might cause many to tune out, but it's worth sticking with.  Larussa is obviously an intelligent man, and that comes across in his discussions on several topics.  He also possesses an obvious love for the game, which many fans will appreciate. <br /> <br />There's a reason why Larussa has won several managerial awards, beyond the fact that he's managed a number of talent-laden teams.  He understands the game, and he strikes a good balance between the science of baseball and managerial intuition.  He wants to win at almost any cost, but he also cares about his players and organization. <br /> <br />Love or hate him - and there are many in both camps - Larussa is a fascinating baseball character.  This should prove of interest to any fan of Larussa, the Cards, or baseball in general. <br /> <br />	2005-04-19

So it's to Pearson's credit that he's able to craft an enjoyable, fast-paced read despite the fact that you know what the ultimate outcome is going to be. <br /> <br />The action at times can seem pretty unbelievable, but that can be forgiven in a thriller.  The characters of Roland Larson and Hope Stevens are both well-crafted, and Pearson does a good job of bringing romance into the story without it becoming overly sappy. <br /> <br />Pearson is a pro, and it shows again in this one.

In his latest effort, however, Siegel provides a chain of unlikely, almost impossible, events that make it difficult to believe anything like this could happen. <br /> <br />The story is pretty straightforward - A couple goes to Colombia to adopt a baby, only to be taken hostage.  To free his wife and new child, our hero must smuggle drugs back into the U.S.  Of course, complications ensue, and he must fight to find a way to save his family and himself.  To that end, it's an effective story, one that anyone with a child can relate to. <br /> <br />The reason I don't think this rates 4-5 stars is that, as I said earlier, the events that take place simply become too unbelievable to have any credence.  It's unfortunate, because I believe this could have been a great book if Siegel had chosen to focus less on trying to shock us with plot twists, and more on the efforts of a desperate man trying to save his family.  Ultimately, the book becomes predictable, and it's easy to guess the outcome. <br /> <br />Siegel is a fine writer, and I don't question his ability to keep the pages turning.  However, I think he needs to worry less about twists (just like in Derailed) and focus on his strength, which is in building tension.  He's written 3 good books to this point, but I think he can get better.	2005-04-07
US	49565872	R3OHL6XNS97YEZ	0743245911	734522183	Luckiest Man: The Life and Death of Lou Gehrig	Books	5	100	102	N	N	Great ballplayer, and a great person	If you're looking for an exhaustive biography of Gehrig, one of the best to ever grace a diamond, look no further.  Eig has written a wonderful book that gives great insight into not only Gehrig the player, but also Gehrig the man. <br /> <br />It's obvious from the discussion of his upbringing that Gehrig was not a \\"typical\\" Yankee star, one who would enjoy the bright lights and fame.  As a child, and continuing into his adult life, he was a shy, modest person who wanted only to work hard and do his best.  His relationship, or lack thereof, with fellow superstar Babe Ruth, is given a lot of coverage, and is one of the more interesting aspects of the book.  Given Gehrig's background and social anxieties, it's not really surprising that he and Ruth (along with other teammates) never seemed to mesh. <br /> <br />While the coverage given to his seasons with the Yankees is comprehensive, it's the anecdotes and off-the-field stuff that really add to the existing knowledge we have of Gehrig.  And even when we know towards the end of the book exactly what's going to happen, Eig still manages to present the onset of his illness and eventual death dramatically, without simply playing on emotions.  I was surprised to learn that his ALS had begun its onset in '38, and not a year later when he was forced to call it quits. <br /> <br />Eig presents Gehrig well, without romanticizing him or turning his book into a hagiography.  While I think any baseball fan will love this book, I don't think being a fan of the sport is a prerequisite to enjoyment.  This is a great biography of a genuinely good man, one who always seemed unsure about being in the spotlight.  Highly recommended.	2005-03-24

However, he makes it clear at other times that this can be a poor approach.  I've got no problem with contradiction, but a little further explanation would have been nice. <br /> <br />This felt like a book that could have been much longer, and one that could have gone deeper, instead of providing plenty of light, anecdotal incidents to prove a point.  While it's one that you'll probably enjoy, it just doesn't leave you with much in the end.	2005-03-23

For each player, there is a fairly comprehensive writeup (as much as can be expected when having to cover so many players), including their performance to this point, what can be expected, and their chances of developing into contributing major league players.  The teams are also ranked in regard to player development, and their drafts are discussed and critiqued.<br /><br />As a fan during baseball season, it's difficult to follow the prospects just from your own team, and impossible to know what's going on with the other 29 clubs.  It's great to have a book like this that can be used as a reference source throughout the season, especially when some of the kids start getting called up to the majors.<br /><br />There's really not a lot out there about prospects.  The annual Scouting Notebook offers some coverage, but their focus is on guys who will contribute in the current year.  If you're interested in the future, this is an important purchase.  Along with John Sickels' Baseball Prospect Book (available only on his website), the BA prospect book should prove both handy and interesting during the season.	2005-03-21

While she's likable, she's also very human in her thoughts and actions, not a superwoman like too many fictional characters. <br /> <br />While the plot includes a serial killer in New Orleans, the book is really about Cat's past and her attempt to get past those events.  Of course, this past eventually ties in somewhat to the present, but Cat is really the focus, far more than the murders.  There's plenty of action and mystery, and Iles keeps the reader hanging for most of the book. <br /> <br />Thrillers are a dime a dozen, but excellent ones like this are far more rare.  An excellent novel, one that will have most readers rushing to get to the end.	2005-03-10

About Great Managing, Great Leading, and Sustained Individual Success	Books	5	14	17	N	N	Great examples, few platitudes	It's difficult to evaluate a book like this so shortly after reading it, since it doesn't give you time to actually apply the insights the author is pushing.  However, it's clear that Buckingham has written another excellent management guide, one that cuts through the frivolity to provide actual answers. <br /> <br />What I liked about this one is that it doesn't use generalities, or vague concepts that are open to various interpretations.  As usual, Buckingham gets right to the heart of the matter, in terms that will help managers (and others) apply the lessons he presents. <br /> <br />I'm always skeptical of these types of management books, as there are so many that are poorly written and completely useless.  This is neither of those - instead, it's a useful, practical guide that should help many people both in an out of the workplace.	2005-03-08

However, this is a pretty disappointing effort, one that isn't nearly as comprehensive or helpful as I would have hoped. <br /> <br />The first section of the book is devoted to articles discussing the history of the draft, including its growth into the spectacle that it is today.  There are also looks at hits and misses, and other historical aspects of the draft.  While some of these are interesting, it's also disappointing that at least one of them is just a reprint of a previous TSN article. <br /> <br />The biggest problem with this book is in its presentation of each year's draft.  Instead of giving a round-by-round recap, it gives only a list of draft picks by team.  For example, if you look at 2004, it won't list who went in each round, only who each team picked.  While it's great to check how your favorite team did each year, I believe that a straight recap by round is absolutely essential, and that's missing.  If you want to know the second-rounders for a given year, you'll have to search through the recap for each team.  To me, this omission really deflates the value of this resource. <br /> <br />Another item I found lacking is some kind of \\"tracker\\" as to how players drafted by each teams, or players drafted in particular rounds, fared in the NFL.  I don't expect anything too comprehensive, but I'd like to know how many players by each round went on to pro careers, or which teams in the past couple of decades have done the best job in the late rounds.  Even if some of it might be anecdotal, it would certainly make for interesting reading. <br /> <br />On the positive side, the list of players drafted from each college is cool.  It lists the schools alpahbetically, then gives all the players drafted from that school in chronological order.  I'd love to see them do the same with high schools, but I'm not sure about the feasability of doing so. <br /> <br/>It seems like this is going to be an annual publication, so there's hope for improvement in the presentation and in what's offered.  Such a book is a great idea, but its value at this point is limited.  With some improvement, it could become an essential purchase.	2005-03-07

This time around, Valentine is hired to figure out how Ricky Smith (the Mr. Lucky of the title) is turning everything he touches to gold. <br /> <br />Valentine is a rarity among protagonists, an older gentleman who manages to hold his own pretty well, while still managing to seem human and vulnerable.  Too many characters in such novels seem to possess almost superhuman abilities, but Valentine is a fallible hero.  The other characters aren't flushed out as well as Tony, but they're still interesting. <br /> <br />The action is paced well, scenes of physical altercations interspersed nicely with thought and discussion.  One minor complaint I have is that the dialogue sometimes seems stilted, but it doesn't detract from enjoyment of the novel.   <br /> <br />I'd recommend this for anyone who likes a fast-paced read with some mystery thrown in the mix.  It's a truly enjoyable book with an excellent lead character.  And you really can't beat that price! <br /> <br />	2005-03-02

What they've done again this year is to pack that knowledge into an excellent publication, one that should be an essential purchase for any fan. <br /> <br />For those who have read previous editions, the layout and content will be familiar, but nonetheless interesting and useful.  Personally, I find the team essays and articles to be the most interesting parts of the book.  That's not to take away from the stats, which help to separate this book from many others, but the group does a great job on the team pages of including a great amount of detail in a relatively small space.  And the casual fan, unfamiliar with terms like VORP and PECOTA, will likely find this book an eye-opener, one that shows a completely different approach to the game than do so many others. <br /> <br />For fantasy players, this is a great resource, complaints about its publication date not withstanding.  However, beyond its fantasy value, it's a great book to have around for the season.  The amount of material packed in these pages is incredible, and the price is amazingly low.  I'd suggest making room for this one on your coffee table, and keeping it there all season long.  It should serve of great value as both an excellent read, and a great reference source for the 2005 season.	2005-02-28

A man falls into an affair, gets found out and blackmailed, and can't do anything about it without ruining multiple families.  Unfortunately, while the first half of the book succeeds in keeping the pages turning, problems in the second half ultimately bring the book down to the level of an ordinary thriller. <br /> <br />As a previous reviewer stated, there are a number of improbabilities that hurt this book.  While I know you have to suspend your disbelief to enjoy almost any thriller, Siegel asks too much of this, as too many unlikely events occur, and pieces fall too conveniently into place.  It also doesn't help that we can see a twist coming shortly after getting into the novel - this could be forgiven, if only it was handled better. <br /> <br />As a cautionary tale against cheating on our wives, this one definitely succeeds.  However, it's disappointing that there was such a letdown as the book went on, especially given its brilliant start.  I'd still recommend reading it, especially given the dearth of truly good thrillers, but I don't think it measures up to his first novel.  Nonetheless, I'm still looking forward to the release of Detour next month.	2005-02-21

They've culled items that are better covered in other publications, which does make this a more economical purchase than buying several other books. <br /> <br />The team information and coverage of the minors isn't nearly as good as the Baseball America almanac, but suffices nevertheless.  The records included are fleshed out more in the TSN Record Book, and both the Bill James annual and Baseball Prospectus provide greater coverage of 2004 individual stats.  Again, though, the coverage here is decent. <br /> <br />If you only purchase one guide for the season, I'd recommend the Major League Baseball Fact Book, which should be shipping soon.  It provides an excellent review of the previous season, along with giving more detailed historical coverage of each team.  TSN publishes that one, too, which I think is interesting given the great overlap among the two.  Still, the TSN guide is a pretty good book.	2005-02-21

Instead, it's a no-nonsense guide to the food we eat, one that examines caloric intake, fats, etc., without laying on the platitudes found in many such guides.  I think it's interesting that Willett discusses the importance of avoiding trans fats, an essential point that the rest of the nutrition world seems finally to have caught up with.   <br /> <br />To me, the discussion of the traditional \\"food pyramid\\" and its faults is one of the best things I've ever read in a nutrition guide.

More than simply a Christian rallying cry to the portrayal of religion in books like The Da Vinci Code, this is a fairly objective examination, backed up with sound research. <br /> <br />Movies like Lord of the Rings are discussed, as is the Gospel of Thomas, the James Ossuary, and others.  The Pates never fall into the trap of simply disputing something because it doesn't fit their beliefs, always looking for evidence, a science/religion marriage that is used very effectively. <br /> <br />I'm not offended at all by items like The Da Vinci Code (which I couldn't put down), and I was a little annoyed at all the books written to refute what was nothing more than a simple piece of entertainment.  So this book was a welcome one, and it's the best of its kind that I've read.  I'd recommend it, especially to those confused or bothered by the media's portrayal of religion.	2005-02-21

That range shows in his choices here, which run from classics like \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\" to brilliant works of anime like \\"Grave of the Fireflies.\\"  I've always thought of Ebert as the \\"common man\\" among movie critics, and this book furthers that reputation. <br /> <br />Each entry is given 3-4 pages of discussion, and a picture is also included from each film.  More than just a review, these entries explain what makes each film \\"great\\" in Ebert's view.  While I might not agree with every selection, it's difficult to argue with his reasoning for their inclusion.  For all films, he looks beyond the obvious reasons for greatness, focusing on cinematography in individual scenes, music selection, and other items that are often overlooked by those of us who have only seen the film once. <br /> <br />I get the feeling Ebert has hundreds more of such films on his list, so I'll forward to the next collection.  With excellent writing and strong arguments, I'd highly recommend this volume for any movie fan.	2005-02-21

Books	5	19	20	N	N	Can't go wrong with Katz's flap books	Take Karen Katz's fantastic illustrations, combine them with a simple lift-the-flap story, and you've got a set that should provide hours of fun for your baby. <br /> <br />This set includes 3 of her more popular titles.  Belly Button and Toes both talk about different body parts, while the third book is a hide-and-seek game between Mommy and baby.  The first 2 are useful in introducing children to names for their body parts, and all 3 will amuse even younger babies simply because of the drawings.  Our 7-month-old is too young to grasp the concept of noses, tummies, etc., but she loves to pull the flaps and to make excited noises when she sees the illustrations of the babies. <br /> <br />You'd think that these might wear out their welcome quickly, but that hasn't been my personal experience.  I've found that kids will continue going back to these ones over and over again.  An inexpensive and worthwhile purchase.	2005-02-09
US	49565872	RRZ66TOMARB15	0892047682	415831533	Scouting Notebook: Your Advanced Scout for 2005 (Sporting News STATS Major League Scouting Notebook)	Books	5	6	8	N	N	An essential purchase for any baseball fan	Along with Baseball Prospectus and the Bill James annual, this is a book that should be on every fan's coffee table throughout the baseball season.  Full of detailed scouting analysis on hundreds of major leaguers, it complements the statistical annuals perfectly, helping to provide a complete picture of each player. <br /> <br />There are 22 players listed for each team, with 12 getting full pages and the others shown with 2 on a page.  Each player's vitals are included on their page, along with situational stats.  For batters, a diagram is included to show hitting tendencies, while pitchers are given a pitching profile showing a further breakdown of their performance versus the league average.  The player evaluations are divided into 4 categories - a recap of their 2004 season, pitching or hitting depending on their position, defense, and a 2005 outlook.  For the players who have to share a page, the hitting/pitching is cominbed with the defense.  Managers and stadiums are also given individual pages, and the park factors and managerial tendencies are useful. <br /> <br />Since more than 22 players contribute to any team, each franchise is also given a couple of pages devoted to \\"Other\\" players, whose stats and evaluation are presented in a succinct, boxscore-type format.  Each team also has a section where several of their top minor league prospects are evaluated.  This number is limited, since the book's main focus is on players expected to contribute to the big team in the upcoming season.  <br /> <br />The only complaints I have about this book are minor.  One is that the stats in the back of the book list batting average first among stats for hitters.  I think even non-stat junkies now accept the fact that OBP or OPS are better measuring sticks for hitters, so I think it would make more sense to list one of those ahead of average.  However, that's truly a minor issue.  The focus of this book is scouting, and that's something it presents beautifully.  <br /> <br />This is one I look forward to every year, and the 2005 edition does not disappoint.  This is one to keep by your side during the baseball season, as it should prove both informative and entertaining.	2005-02-09

Considering the popularity of pro football in this country, the historical literature on the game has really been lacking, especially when compared to the thousands of works on baseball.  Finally, McCambridge has crafted what should prove as the definitive history of the game, one that any fan of football should enjoy. <br /> <br />Although it's a 500-page book, the author's style makes this a pretty brisk read.  While full of details, the book isn't overwhelmed by them, always giving the reader an excellent view of the big picture, and of the role that each person and event plays.  It's clear that the author admires many of the people he talks about, but he still manages to present both praise and criticism, never letting his work become hagiographic.  His treatment of the AFL-NFL relationship during the years before their merger is the best I've seen. <br /> <br />This is truly a book that's just been waiting to be written.  Thankfully, McCambridge has done great justice to a subject ripe for examination.  I think this should be necessary reading for anyone who considers themselves a serious fan.	2005-02-08

As someone with a young daughter, I found it to be both a cautionary tale and an engrossing memoir.  For anyone who has an alcoholic or binge drinker in their family, you'll be able to relate on some level.  For me, it was interesting to hear about the experience from the perspective of a young woman. <br /> <br />The author writes lucidly and poetically about her past, showing the effects of her lifestyle without ever trying to invoke pity for anything that happened to her in the past.  It makes one wonder how common her story, or at least certain elements of it, are to many young women.   <br /> <br />Although the material is often heavy and depressing, this one will keep your attention.  A terrific and frightening account.	2005-02-08

For fans who watched a lot of ball in the '70s, this should be especially enjoyable. <br /> <br />What's interesting about Ballew's book is that he didn't focus on the decade's biggest stars.  Several of the interviewees were outstanding players - Vida Blue, Tommy John, Bob Boone - but there's not a Hall of Famer among the bunch, and lesser names like Fred Patek and Don Money are given an equally large share of time.  This approach is great, as it gives us perspectives from several angles, not just from dominant players. <br /> <br />Highly recommended, a good book to leaf through while watching an early season game.	2005-02-01
US	49565872	R29WUROCLVUF8Z	1566635519	628960448	The Pitch That Killed	Books	5	13	14	N	Y	Among the best baseball books ever written	Take a compelling story - the evil Carl Mays felling the likable Ray Chapman with a pitch - combine it with a brilliant writer, and the result is this book, one of the best-ever baseball reads. <br /> <br />Sowell manages to transport the reader back to the period in which the story takes place (1910s and 1920s), while still allowing the tale to play out without clutter or unnecessary writing.  Unlike the many one-dimensional portrayals of Mays included in other works, Sowell paints him as a complex character, a great pitcher who obviously battled some emotional issues.  The death of Chapman doesn't need to be dressed up to be heartbreaking, and Sowell presents the situation in a straightforward manner. <br /> <br />From the first page to the end of the book, it's difficult to find fault with anything.  Just a compelling story told by a great writer, this is a book that any fan of baseball should read.	2005-02-01

Little is glossed over, and both Herb Brooks and several players are examined in detail.  Brooks is not portrayed as a saint, but his genius in creating a team and a system to win gold shines through. <br /> <br />The Russians are not treated as a bunch of villains, but instead are shown to be just as human as the American boys.  The political climate of the time obviously made the victory that much sweeter, and Coffey does an excellent job of setting the victory against that backdrop. <br /> <br />As a hockey fan, it's difficult to think of a greater moment than watching the players and crowd go crazy as those final seconds ticked away - for many of us, it still gives us chills 25 years later.  This book does a wonderful job of honoring one of the great moments in American sports history.	2005-01-18

Included are the regular season and postseason stats for anyone who appeared in the majors in 2004.  Don't expect to see advanced stats like VORP or EqERA, but there are items like lefty-righty batting and pitching breakdowns. <br /> <br />For a traditional stats publication, TSN has done a decent job.  If you need something with more Sabermetric info, I'd suggest waiting for Prospectus, or using the BP site.	2005-01-17

It aims only to be a recap of the year in sports, as well as a historical reference, both of which it does well. <br /> <br />The Olympic coverage is excellent, as is the recap of the 2004 baseball season.  One thing ESPN does exceptionally well is baseball, and that shows in this book. <br /> <br />The only negative to this item is that it plays too much on the ESPN brand - things like Sportscenter Top 10 lists are cute, but I'd rather just have the facts.  Still, I'd recommend this as something for sports fans to keep on their bookshelves.  Sure, you can find most of the info online if you know where to look, but it's nice to have convenient access all in one place.	2005-01-17

I don't think any of us read his novels looking for any kind of enlightment, but instead we only want an intelligent, fun ride.  To that end, The Broker is a success. <br /> <br />Unlike some of his more recent books, this one sticks to his old formula - a sympathetic character, intrigue, and a \\"chase\\" leading into a good ending.  The only thing that drags the book down is that Backman's time in Italy reads at times like a pastoral novel.  I'm all for character development, but we learn more at times about the country than about Backman. <br /> <br />I still look back on early efforts like A Time to Kill and The Firm as being Grisham's best.  This doesn't reach that level, but it's certainly a welcome improvement from recent material. <br />	2005-01-12

Martin spends the novel doing 2 things - trying to prove to others who he really is, and questioning his own existence. <br /> <br />While he may not be breaking any new ground, Van Cauweleart definitely makes the reader think about the value and meaning of memories and self-awareness.  A great book, one that would likely be worthy of 5 stars if not for the poor finish.	2005-01-04

For stats junkies who just want the numbers, it's a great book.  For those who prefer Prospectus and their comments (for better or, often, worse), this may be a disappointment because of its lack of commentary on players. <br /> <br />There is some discussion of items like the career projections and injury projections, but no essays that make his Abstracts or other books like Win Shares so popular.  I'd definitely consider this a must for 2005 - a concise, easy to use guide to the essential stats that can be kept on your coffee table all season - but I wouldn't recommend it for anyone who doesn't share an obsession with stats.	2004-11-24

However, this is a surprisingly insightful look at the Yankee dynasty, delivered in an interesting format. <br /> <br />Interspersing action from Game 7 of the 2001 World Series with a look at the members of the Yankees' organizations - not only the players, but also Steinbrenner, Cashman, Gene Michael, etc. - Olney examines the building of the dynasty, and how it finally came apart. <br /> <br />I think all baseball fans, regardless of whether they love or hate the Yankees, should enjoy this one.  Simply put, it's a good baseball book, and Olney does a terrific job.	2004-11-24

Despite his fall from grace, Jack is still known as a man with a skill for finding things.  Enter the beautiful older woman (one of many cliches this book gets away with) with the missing daughter, and Jack's back in action.  Inevitably, he has encounters with all sorts of seedy types, leading to a resolution that may not satisfy some readers.<br />The story may not be original, but Bruen's writing more than makes up for it.  A great read for fans of the P.I. novel, especially those who appreciate strong writing.  Unfortunately, this book will likely be overlooked in favor of others, but for anyone interested it's definitely worth the time.	2003-01-03

However, I'll give him credit for at least making people aware of the history and development of the SUV.  I thought the most interesting aspect of the book was its examination of how the auto industry sees SUV buyers.  As one of them, I wouldn't agree with their characterizations completely, but I guess that should be expected. <br />As for the perception of SUV drivers acting like maniacs cutting others off and tailgating, I have two questions - did this not exist before SUVs?  And do drivers of smaller cars not do the same?<br />I'm all for safety, which is why I'd never buy any horrible American-built SUV.  And while I'm not a paranoid ultra-rightist, I have to agree that the media's presentation of SUVs as killing machines is a little off.  Of course they're more dangerous than a car - look at the size of them.  <br />Bradsher raises some good points, but a more fair and balanced treatment would have been appreciated.	2002-12-30

However, since this is \\"the\\" classic of the fantasy genre (sorry, Harry Potter fans), I figured I'd better read it before I could criticize it.  It turned out to be an excellent trilogy, well-written with some timeless messages.<br />I wouldn't go so far as [...] to compare it to the Bible (anotehr good piece of fiction?), and I wouldn't call it the greatest novel ever written - I don't think it compares with Moby Dick or a few other classics.  However, I think that all of my fellow critics of the whole fantasy genre should try reading this.  I know very few people who actively dislike Tolkein, but I know many who have never picked up anything he's written.  An excellent pick if you're going to read any fantasy.  I get the feeling it's all downhill from here.	2001-12-03
