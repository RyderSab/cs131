I bought it after thinking about what I wanted to read this summer (I always make lists of books I want to read over the summer before it begins). I decided it might be fun in get into more chick-lit(ish) type of books, because they are charectorized as being light, fun and airy, and sounded like perfect summer reads. This would be the first of its kind I would read. I would be dissapointed. I, like the many other people who read this book,was snagged by the tite and idea that we'd find out what it was like to be behind the scenes of a chic,top-selling fashion magazine. What I got was a array of complaints and an EXTREMEly annoying charector. The narrator Andrea is soppoused to be smart and sarcastically witty, but I just found her annoying. The errands her boss sends her on are not as over-the-top as the book jacket suggests. She has to get her coffe, drop off some clothes, and call a few people. Now, im not saying that I wouldint mind having to do these same things day after day, but it's really not enough to complain in a whole BOOK about. Also, this book is just plain CORNY at times. Esp. when her boy-freind Alex is involved. I must admit that I couldin't read the whole book; not only because it was so boring, but also because I litterally had an allegric reaction to the pages it was printed on, so I don't know if im fully qualified to review this book. I only got to chapter 11, but from what I read, I wouldin't reccomend this book. I WOULD reccomend &quot;The Nannie Diaries&quot;, which is somewhat similar in the way it's about working for the rich, but is MUCH better. I just finished it tonight, and was very happy with it!	2004-05-28

Of all my expierence of practicing Wicca, this book here has got to be filled with the most difficult and advanced spells I've ever read of. Several of them could be described as IMpossible.Many of the items crucial to do them are either very expensive, or are only available in certain parts of the world! This being said, im sure that they're much more affective because of the lengths needed to go thru to complete any of these.	2004-02-09

When Tubby Robin Wilson is Pledged by Elizabeth for the Pi Beta Alpha, Jessica and her freinds Cara Walker and Lila Fowler throw her Difficult, and very emabaressing tasks such as running Several Miles around the Track in front of Half the Student Body, getting Bruce Patman to Take Her to the Discomarathon (Ha,ha,ha! Well, it was the Early 80's!), Go to the Beach in a Bikini and Play Volleyball, and Steal Test Answers from thier Overbearing Chemistery Teacher, All in Order to be able to Join the Soroity.

When she finds out Lila has been Shop-Lifting for the Attention of her Father, she asks Elizabeth Not to Tell Jessica, which her sister Highly Suspects...Overall, this was a Very Enjoyable read. I was suprised that Lila Connfinded in Elizabeth so much. I didn't even think they were Even Freinds! The Story of Robin and her Loss of Weight was Inspirational, if not Far-Fetched for her to Lose all that Weight in a Week. Reccomended.	2003-08-24

Okay, im a BIG collector of Grosset and Dunlap and other publishers Childrens Books from the 1910's, all the way to the 1960's (Exspecially Mystery Ones), from Nancy Drew, to The Rover Boys. I was out Antiqeing when I found &quot;Cherry Ames: Seinor Nurse&quot; (I had to write a Review about it Here because theres no page for it!), w/ it's dust-jaket in good condition, for a really good price. I've heared wonderful thing's about the series, so I decided to give it a shot. I don't know if it was because I never read the first one, or what, but I never really could get into it. Things eventually started to move along...Before I just decided to quit reading. Because I don't know much about being a nurse, and medical techniques, yadda, yadda, yadda, I found this book a bit confusing at times...Also, I just got bored stiff. The whole book is mainly about Cherry on Check-Ups, taking care of patients, and her assiting doctors in the operating room. As you can see, this is exactly fascinating reading. All in all, I think I'll stick to mysterys instead of medical guides...	2003-08-13

This is seriously the FUNNIEST book I have ever read! Ive read it over a ZILLION times now! Shinchan NEVER fails to raise my spirits! My only complaint is how poorly made the book(s) itself is...Already 5 pages have fallen out! Otherwise, I am VERY pleased with the whole thing! Its the only anime I ever read now! As for him being the Bart Simpson of Japan?!?! Well...I wouldint exactly say that...hes done ALOT more worse things than any Simpson ever has! Also, the author really seems to understand about how kindergardeners think and behave...Shinchan seems so real! As for the artwork...I wouldint say it's BAD (you should see the CARTOON!), but really basic...Overall, I denfinetly reccomend this!	2003-06-29

I almost felt like I was obligated to read this as my mother had gotten it for me for a surprise (*she thought it looked cute*), and I didn't want to hurt her feelings...And, ironically, this book focuses more on mother/daughter relationships, while the first one, parents were pushed aside, and were just sort of there...There was ALOT of drama in this one...Carmen and her mother dating again, Bridget finding out about her mothers past, Tibby facing Bailey's death, and, most notable of all, Lena and Kostos's relationship...Some parts were rather hard to swallow, as with the first one. Bridget was (temporarely) a much different person from the first, Biran played a much more important role, and Lena seemed to be much more (much, MUCH more) open about her feelings toward Kostos...It was also several pages longer than its predecessor, therefore it took a few days later to finish it than TSHOTTP...The seconed to last chapter was un-necessary and just seem to add more bulk to it (which may have been the point...) but it all ended sweetly in the end...Overall, I say if you liked the first one, you'll probably enjoy this one too, maybe even better....	2003-06-24

Well, first off, I'll tell you that at 14, believe or not, this was the first Judy Blume book i've ever read. I mainly chose this book becuase im into 40's pop-culture and fashion, and, well, I liked the cover. About that. Sally looks a bit older than she turned out to be on it(I thought she may have been in her early teens...), so I thought this book may be suitable for my age group...As it turned out, she was a little imaginative 10 yr. old girl who made up stories and dreamed of being a ballerina...BUT, I still found it to be a fairly entertaining book, but which had no real plot to it. It really turned out to be a kids book. I sort-of think of Sally as the Anne of Green Gables of the Late 40's...I think maybe Tiger Eyes may appeal to me more...	2003-06-15

Soon she encounters the pretensious young golfer Martin Bartescue. An arrogant golf stroke leads her into the woods rather to find her ball, she discovers a brass jewel case. Knowing her father is on the lookout of a ring of jewel thieves, Nancy is soon underway upon another adventure. The revision of this book, considering it was written in the 70's, which is to most fans known to be the era in which the worst books were written, wasn't all that bad. Although the internal art work is just TERRIBLE as in most Nancy's around this time, the writing is average. Although the original is ten times superior to the revision, I'd still reccomend it...	2003-03-01

In this volume, Nancy is asked to solve a case as to where Juliana Johonson, a famous dancer, has disappeared to, so she can collect her inherentince, the Heath Castle, in time. One thing leads to another, and, of course, Nancy saves the day once again, not excepting an offered reward.  This, like many of the later re-writes in the 70's, is dull, lifeless, and stale. The writing is bland and there is no charector development whatsover. I have read every yellow-spined Nancy and have to say that about only half the set is any good. If you possibly can, try to read the originals written by Mildred Wirt during the 30's and 40's....the golden-age of Nancy Drew, although (most) of the revised and later ones are not bad (some of them classics), the originals are the best....	2003-01-21

This series is alot, if not completely, different from the Baby-Sitters Club series. Im not saying this is a bad thing, but im not saying it's a good thing. Ann M.'s writing style is way diffrent, and so are the charectors. They have bigger and a little more important problems from those of Kristy, Claudia, Mallory, Stacey, Jessise, etc. Finishing this book only minutes ago, I have to say it was quite chessy at times. I felt a little embaressed for the author who was obviously trying to make the charector sound \\"cool\\". I thought Amalia's drawings were a little, well, stupid, and the dialouge kind of corny.

It seemed as if the writer('s) really did'nt care what thier readers would think of thier work, just as long a they got thier pay check, they were happy. And the art is atroucious! The cover paintings arent too bad, but its the illustrations inside the books that really show the lazziness of the artist. I really liked the original illustrater's (which was Russel Tandy) approach. He would first actually read the whole book before going to work, unlike Nappi who would doodle a few pencil drawings that looked as if they came from a generic color book from Big Lots...

While I loved Matilda and *liked* The Witches, I found this book almost, well, comepletely stupid. Mr. Hoppy has loved his neigbor Ms. Silver for a very long time, but has never summond up the courage to tell her his feelings. One day while they were having a chat, Ms. Silver mentions that she worries about her much loved tortises size. So Mr.Silver comes up with a ridiculous plan to make it look the it had grown, then before you know it, they're married. I read this book in about twenty minutes, and i can never see how this can be depictied as a novel. The story was absolutely just plain stupid! This was written for younger audiences, I kept that in mind, but I dont think it's the kind of story children would like, there's no point to it! NOT reccomended.	2002-05-06

So far I have only read the Lady Red bird one, which was quite difficult to read, which I still liked though, and the Zhizo one or whatever, you know, the African one, which proved to be to short and very boring. But this one was funny, interesting, and very educational. Marie Antionette an seem like an air-head sometimes, but she had that Scarlett O'hara feeling in her. Shes head-strong and determined to learn all her lessons. The thing I disliked was I did a little research on her and found that she was really a little brat who got everything she wanted. Her peronallity is deciving of what she was really like in history in this book.	2002-04-14

Madison is constanly saying stupid things like, \\"thats cooler than cool\\", or \\"thats so bizzaro' Another thing is, shes to nice! She doesnt have much of a pesonality. When you think about it, this is not what kids act. As for the story, Madsion complains about how much she misses freinds Egg (theres a REALLY stupid reason why hes called that) and Aimee. I think the author just thought kids thought names like Egg are cool, though she trys to hide this behind the fact that hes called that because he got hit by eggs one year on Halloween...Very boring story line. This is one of thse books that you count how many pages are left until you FINALLY finish the story.I started out liking it, but it got worse and worse, and the authors writing started to decline. If you feel you MUST read this book, borrow it from a freind or the libary.	2002-04-14

I just about mmbled over the names. Plus, if you noticed, on the top of the book it says \\"Special Edition\\". Whats so special about it? It looks pretty much the same as the othe ones. Hard back, gold lined pages, pretty illustration on the cover.Nothing new.	2002-04-14

Im only half way thorough the 5th chapter, but I have found that this book just keeps me asking questions. They don't give enough info. And theres not alot of detail. Sometimes I just have no idea what they're talking about, I just get lost! Example: When Artemis is fiddling around with some screws and a magnet, they dont give enough backround to whats going on, so I have no idea where or what they're doing. It feels like the author was just so enthusiastic about the story, he left out abunch of needed details for he was in some kind of flurry....For now, I give this book a three, this is a very frusterating story...	2002-03-23

If you read this series in order starting with the first, you may not get the best impression of the rest of the series. The story's simple enough to follow to be able to start with any volume of this \\"woeful series\\". I read first the 5th and 6th, 7th and 8th, then the first four...At first I was skeptical about the series, after hearing that it wasn't as good as Harry Potter, but I have gotten more \\"into\\" this series than any other I have before.	2002-03-22

The charectors are very realistic and neat in thier own way. I thought it was sad the way Enid and Rebecca grew apart ( it's even sadder in the movie. I got mad at Enid for neglecting Rebecca all the time, and not content to move in with her ( which sort of made me hate the record collector for pulling them apart).	2002-03-06

From what I have seen, the author pretty much stole most of his ideas from an issue I have once seen of that magazine. This guy is sick.... and, yes, he claims he did keep in mind that kids would also read this piece of \\"art\\", but fails to keep perverted jokes out of it. I'd be pretty [angry] if I were J.K. Rowling.... I mean, why would a fan of her work want to make fun of it? Another note: the price on this book is ridiculois, 10 bucks for a soft cover book? And yes, I HAVE read this, so I know what im talking about....	2002-03-03

Due to the reviews, you may have guessed this was a good one. This one brings a whole new turn to the series. At first, the series may have seemed dull and a little out of place, but from this one one the series gets better. Note: this is an important book in the series, even though its a later book in the series, this probably another good book to start with ( besides the first) if you want to read the whole collection.	2002-02-17
