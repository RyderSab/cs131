Iovine really de-mystifies toddlerhood in a relatable and funny way. I liked the Top Ten lists, the tongue-in-cheek style of writing, and the constant advice to calm down and stop stressing. I also appreciated the chapter on fashion, something you won't see mentioned at all in most parenting guides. Very enjoyable to read--even sections that don't apply to me--and highly recommended for mommies.	2005-09-13

My favorites? \\"A Temporary Matter\\", in which an Indian couple, struggling after a miscarriage, finds solace during a week of nightly blackouts, \\"When Mr. Pirzada Came to Dine\\" about a young Indian girl living in America who learns about the Pakistan civil war through the visits of a worried house guest, and \\"The Third and Final Continent\\", a story about an immigrant who finds common ground with a 103 year old American woman through manners, politeness, and civility long abandoned in 1960's America. Many of the stories touch upon the subject of Indians interacting with westerners, but not all of them. I don't usually read short story collections, but this one is exceptional and highly recommended.	2005-02-06

Books	5	11	17	N	Y	Right on, Michael Moore	Liberals these days have fewer and fewer educated, well-informed people willing to speak out for our side, especially in this country of 'red states' where raising questions about the current administration is seen as unpatriotic and 'liberal' is suddenly a bad word. Between FOX news and AM talk radio shows, alot of brainwashing has been going on and the media is increasingly one-sided. Enter Michael Moore, who is not afraid to criticize, speak his mind, point out glaring facts that have been completely ignored by the media, and generally confirm my suspicions about the Bush administration and its big business ties, cuts in social programs, disregard for the environment, support of religion in government, military aggression, and overall lack of progressive vision.  <br /> <br />I think the most important statistic of the book is that Gore won the 2000 election by 539,898 votes but was cheated out of the presidency by an unstoppably corrupt GOP, headed by George Bush.  <br /> <br />Moore delves into other important issues, including the increasing stupidity of Americans (obvious from this last election's result), racial inequality, corporate greed, our distressing foreign policy, and the weakness of democrats in the legislature. Very much a thought provoking book that everyone should read.	2004-12-15

In the midst of it all is a kidnapped labrador retriever and the lobbyist's wife. One can't help but notice the 'us vs. them' theme of the novel--politicians and developers are evil, extreme nature-hating sadists, while  conservationists are beacons of intelligence and pathos. Even I, as a liberal, can see exagerrated stereotypes at use in the novel. Nevertheless, it's often fun to read and the story line is truly unique. The characters are colorful, although there are probably too many of them. Throw in Barbie dolls and a rhino and it starts to feel like a circus. Not highly recommended, but not bad either.	2004-10-31

Although I appreciate the novel's central themes--loss of religion, loss of natioanl identity--I have little patience for the convoluted metaphors and imagery. It just took the pleasure out of reading and reminded me of the headache I got trying to read 'Foucault's Pendulum' (Umberto Eco). The first part of the novel was the most interesting, introducing the characters, but their visions after the fall to earth are just too bizarre and bewildering, lacking a story line or point of focus. Maybe I'm just a stupid American, but I think reading should be enjoyable, and this novel simply wasn't.	2004-09-26

Somehow Lamott is able to make the tough first year of her son's into a hilariously funny read. She's dealing with alot more than sleeplessness and colic-- staying sober, single motherhood, and financial woes are just the beginning. Love for her son, faith in God, and a bevy of supportive friends and family help her along the way. Great to read if you're a new mom because you can compare notes (yeah, my kid does that) and can easily empathize. Religion fills in the gaps of her life, without dominating the novel. Lamott's writing is honest and evocative. Makes you wonder if there's going to be an updated version, since baby Sam must be a teen by now.	2004-08-09

Mary is surrounded by advisors and lords, who are untrustworthy and scheming despite seemingly close relationships with her. Her brother James and her closest advisor, Lethington, spend a great deal of time negotiating her marriage amongst European leaders, namely Queen Elizabeth of England. Her choice of husband ultimately leads to chaos, rebellion, scandal, and accusations of murder and adultery. <br />The novel is well-written and very concise, but weighed down by a flurry of lords, dukes, and royals that are really hard to keep track of. Take the web on the cover illustration as a big hint--it's not eay to grasp the relationships between characters, and new characters are being introduced even in the final chapters of the novel. The family tree at the start of the book doesn't help much.<br />Great novel for those who love to read historically-based novels, but a bit of a struggle unless you have a great attention span and alot of patience.	2003-12-02

But as his financial security destabilizes, so does his moral character. It's an interesting progression, all the more fascinating because it gives us working class types an opportunity to despise the filthy rich.

Iwasaki's claim that the novel is a distortion of her life story did little to diminish my attention span as I read this book. I simply could not put it down. In fact, I used the People magazine article about her as a bookmark.  <br />Anyway, I thought this novel would be all about feet-binding and sex, but it's actually very tastefully written and focuses more on the intense competitiveness between Geisha than on their sexual lives--competition for security in the form of a wealthy danna, or sponsor. This novel was much better than I'd expected. I think the author did a great job considering he was writing in a woman's voice and dealing with such a mysterious and private world.	2003-05-17

Every component of colonial life is examined--slavery, relations with Indian tribes, relations with Europe and the ensuing political conflicts, and the status of women.  Clara and Catalyntie emerge from their lives as Seneca captives to choose two divergent paths--Dutch Catalyntie in search of wealth and business success, black Clara in a search of the inner peace that her external world has denied her based on race. But they both find love from the same man, Malcolm Stapleton, an aspiring soldier who struggles with his own issues of identity and belonging, religion and country.

After escaping, he transforms into the Count of Monte Cristo (with the help of an uncovered treasure), and infiltrates Parisian high society with the intention of ruining the men who unjustly imprisoned him fourteen years prior. <br />An interesting story with a lot of drama, but the Count is a bit larger than life, richer than the wealthiest man in Paris, extravagant, and omnipresent in a really annoying way. Rather than retaining the modesty of the Marseille sailor he used to be, he turns into this perfect, almost deity figure who can do no wrong, cures the sick, solves everyone's problems,walks on water, etc... <br />There are alot of detailed discussion about money in the novel, perhaps a sign of the times and the birth of capitalism. Money and politics are the tools used by the Count to get revenge. <br />This novel is definitely better than the movie that came out last year (distorted Hollywood [junk]) but it was not as amazing as I'd expected. By the way, I read the full, unabridged edition, but this was the only edition I could write a review for.	2003-01-09

No detail is left out and no stone unturned, resulting in what is, at times, a jumbled panoply of lawyers, deal-making, press attention, and family dysfunction. Throw in a miserable 'love story' between two self-absorbed and selfish individuals, and you have yourself a Pulitzer Prize winner. <br />It's hard to keep track and stay interested when the plot and focus of the novel turns from Gilmore to the circus of press, lawyers, movie directors, and judges surrounding him. Here's a selfish, cold-blooded, vile murderer and sociopath who commands the attention and admiration of the press and the nation because he's to be the first person executed in the US in 20 years and because he welcomes the sentence. Well big deal....<br />I really feel for the families of Benny Bushnell and Max Jensen, who had to endure seeing their loved ones' killer on tv, on magazine covers, sought out for interviews and having movies made about him while little attention was paid to the victims. What a shame! <br />Quantity surpasses quality in this novel, if you ask me. Less is more...I say this NOT because I dislike long novels, but because a lot of the minutia details in the novel don't contribute much to the overall story , are simply distracting, and although it shows what a huge effort was made in writing the novel, it adds little entertainment or educational value to the book. For example, do we really need to know about Lawrence Schiller's flight schedule and his relationship with his girlfriend? Or Gary's former cellmate's medical troubles? Those are just a few examples...extraneous rambling in a novel of otherwise great import which is just unnecessarily long.	2002-12-17

Twain refers to everyone, from the Portuguese to Arabs and even some Italians as savages. The modern reader should be 'understanding', recognizing that this is written in a time when political correctness and the reasons behind it were unheard of, but I couldn't help twinging over Twain's predjudices. Nevertheless, I rarely start a book without finishing, so I kept on, motivated by laugh-out-loud scenarios Twain vividly describes, bold cynicism, and what turns out to be, quite simply, a really good story. It's easy to see why this is not included on most school reading lists, but it has some entertainment value nonetheless. Plus, Twain's writing is superb, like nothing you'll find on today's bestseller lists.	2002-10-01

Mahfouz in \\"Palace Walk\\". A loving father sees his well-intentioned strictness backfire in many ways in this novel of family closeness. Amina, a devoted wife and mother, has no qualms about being kept under lock and key by her husband, and has her beliefs confirmed by the disastrous consequences of a secret excursion.<br />One of the more intriguing characters in the novel is Yasin, eldest son of Al-Sayyid Ahmad, and most likely to follow in his father's footsteps. Passion for music, wine, and women runs unchecked in his blood and, like his father, would rather spend the night in the company of mistresses and friends than with his family. <br />Fahmy is the intellectual heart of the family and has a devotion to his country's fight for independence that surpasses family ties and respect for his father's wishes. His undercover behavior and quest for martyrdom helps explain modern Muslim fundamentalism. <br />The sisters Aisha and Khadija are in a race for marriage, complicated by the extreme beauty of the younger sister and the disfiguring nose of the eldest.<br />Kamal lends a child's perspective to the novel, questioning the norms of Egyptian society and forging a shaky bond with occupying English soldiers. He's the fly on the wall that we'd all like to be, as readers, curious and questioning.<br />Overall, this is a profoundly intriguing novel that fully penetrates the minds of every character in \\"Palace Walk\\", and in doing so provides the reader with a significant portrayal of an Egyptian society steeped in culture and ruled by religion.	2002-08-02

Just when she seems to have hit an emotional rock bottom, she is dealt another blow: a disturbed student falsely accuses her of sexual molestation and she is carted off to jail, leaving behind two daughters, her Wisconsin farm, and her faithful(?) husband. The novel is written very realistically, exposing emotions and insecurities, strengths and weaknesses. Alice is repeatedly the guilt-filled victim--of a false accusation, of battery while in jail, and of her husband's infidelity--yet she has this unrealistic ability to forgive and understand. That's probably why I only gave this novel 4 stars--the main character's lack of anger is unrealistic to me.

Repeated exposure to proper Spanish grammar, verb tenses, and vocabulary is far more beneficial to me than rote memorization from a textbook, and sometimes the stories are so interesting that you forget that you're reading a different language. The folklore of Latin America is brought to life by the stories, which cover many scenarios and countries. My biggest criticsm is that the dictionary in the back should include more words, and the translation could be more literal, if possible.

Family dynamics are impacted by politics, forbidden love, Westerners, and nature. The lushness of the Southern Indian landscape is brought to life through the details--a bird, an insect, a plant. The author writes with an eloquent playfulness (at times ridiculous) and frequent repetition, which kind of turns the novel into poetry. Also courageously written, touching upon issues rarely mentioned outwardly in Indian culture, and especially by Indian women.<br />I traveled to India 4 years ago as a student, didn't stay there long, (hard to fit in, being an almost 6 foot tall black woman-many stares) but I will always be fascinated by Indian culture and literature.	2001-11-05

After reading the first few pages of Clockwork Orange, I thought it would be too painful to continue, but the word substitutions gradually became clear, and the story evolved into a powerful and-surprisingly-humorous narrative. Gang leader Alex rebels against society in every way, rejecting decency, work, and even language. His mischief eventually leads him to prison at age 15, and mishaps there result in his being selected for criminal rehab by association. The rest is what turns the novel into a classic--the criminal becomes victim, grows more charming in the process, and learns how to grow up.	2001-10-04
US	50610253	R1DT8U9U3Y74WW	0345427637	327814320	The Angel of Darkness	Books	3	0	1	N	N	Historical thriller, but less history, more thriller	A mismatched group of investigators, spearheaded by a touch-feely Dr. Kreizler, investigate the crimes of a suspected kidnapper in Angel of Darkness. The story is narrated by a rootbeer-drinking adolescent with ties to New York's underworld. The investigators seem to build a firm case against Libby Hatch, and come close to understanding her psyche (clearly Munchausen's syndrome--not even mentioned in the author's acknowledgements) but she slips through their fingers. The novel seems to deteriorate after that, with the author turning to street brawls and other cliches to keep the story going. The novel seemed to have very little connection to New York in the 19th century, and the tv-movie type ending is really pathetic. The reader is never really convinced of Libby Hatch's ferocity, there's very little suspense, and many aspects of the story are unconvincing.	2001-09-16
US	50610253	R2D8ENKSZXTDQJ	080411109X	207990769	The Hundred Secret Senses	Books	4	1	1	N	N	Past and present lives, connected by yin eyes	In The Hundred Secret Senses, the author delves into the realm of magic realism, explores the theme of reincarnation, and creates a wonderfully amicable character in Kwan. The best part of the novel is its humor--Kwan's struggle with the English language and her innocent nagging of her American-born sister Olivia. Her telling of the Christian missionaries' story and her connection to them in a past life turns out to be a focal part of the novel, but I eventually dreaded reading these sometimes boring accounts. I didn't enjoy Secret Senses as much as Tam's other novels (especially Kitchen God's Wife), but overall it was an interesting read. The author doesn't utilize magic realism quite as effectively as Garcia Marquez or Allende, but still creates a convincing spiritual connection between the generations.	2001-08-18
US	50610253	R2I9CZA0ODX0V	0812521463	477457064	Aztec	Books	3	9	20	N	N	A grand account of the Aztecs, but disturbingly flawed	I thoroughly enjoyed learning about Aztec culture and civilization in this lengthy and detailed novel, but the author's tendency towards writing as graphically as possible is pretty disturbing. Of course I expected to read about the human sacrifices well-documented by historians, but the author includes detailed accounts of fictional massacres and perverse tortures (especially of women) that are on the same literary level as a horror novel.<br />While in one passage, he writes poetically and in a respectable literary style, in the next he sounds more like Stephen King, perhaps trying to be as gross as possible to add shock-value to the novel. The author also probes deeper into the main character's sex life than is necessary in an historical fiction novel, including such perversions as sex with a boy and with small children, which almost made me stop reading the novel. Surely such offensive acts were/are, unfortunately, a shameful part of even the most advanced civilizations' secret lives, but their inclusion added little of substance to the novel, and instead detracts greatly from the enjoyment of it.<br />If the author had focused more on getting facts correct about the Aztecs, and less on disgusting his readers, this would have been a more engaging novel to read.	2001-08-05
US	50610253	RFJ1LLQZ8WL29	0375700757	11590154	Cold Mountain: A Novel	Books	5	7	9	N	N	More than a war love story	As if daily life and basic survival weren't hard enough in the mid 19th century, Charles Frazier adds to it the impact of war , solitude, and separation in &quot;Cold Mountain&quot;. The reader first meets Inman as he lies in a hospital bed, recovering from a battle wound and contemplating his continued service in the ongoing Civil War. After a fellow soldier dies without completing  his life's work, Inamn makes the decision to live life for himself, and thus begins a journey on foot back to his hometown (located at the base of Cold Mountain) and to his love Ada. I've always enjoyed a novel that encompasses adventure, travel, and journeying. &quot;Cold Mountain&quot; has it all, while at the same time rising to the level of great literature. Frazier uses country dialects and varied descriptive elements to bring the Confederate South alive. Ada is a shining light in the novel, being transformed from a delicate Charleston society lady to a self-sufficient farm propietress by Ruby, who has a survival story of her own.<br />Although the novel is filled with tragedy, despair, and suffering, this helps to add strength to the characters and depth to the work. If you can make it through a few slow parts, you'll find this to be a fully enjoyable reading experience.	2001-05-23

Everest Disaster	Books	5	0	0	N	N	Couldn't put this one down	The force of nature, and its impact on even the most highly trained climbers on Everest, is recreated in Into Thin Air with amazing attention to detail. Krakauer acquaints the reader with the history of Everest-climbing expeditions, the teams on the mountain during the disaster, the particular members of his own climbing team, and then a compelling look at what happened before , during, and after the hurricane-strength storm that took so many lives that day. You won't be able to put the book down when Krakauer begins to describe the frustration and agony he experienced during the day's climb, then the confusion and chaos as the storm hit and his team became scattered and irretrievable on the mountaintop. Krakauer is exceedingly regretful about some decisions he made on that fateful day, and the reader can feel the weight of his remorse and sorrow through his candid writing. This adds to the somnolence of the novel, but also empowers the work with deep emotion. More than a chronology of what happened on Everest on May 10, 1996, Into Thin Air is an outpouring of honest sentiment from Krakauer, who clearly experienced a great deal of pain at the tragic loss of admirable colleagues.	2001-05-03
US	50610253	RZ4TMV1PXDGMG	068484477X	709347155	Stones from the River	Books	4	1	1	N	N	The Infallible Zwerg	In Stones from the River, Ursula Hegi writes brilliantly, bringing color and light to a dark period of German history. Hegi's portrayal of the horrors and inhumanity of Nazi Germany is realistic and honest, and runs parallel with the sadness of Trudi's life. From beginning to end, the novel is filled with sadness: the impact of short stature on a child's life, the shock of losing one's mother, the humiliation of personal violation, being witness to the pain of war, and then losing her only love to that war. This adds power to the novel, and strength to Trudi's character, but since the work is weighed down by constant despair, it is less believable and less enjoyable. Trudi is not only a repeated victim in the novel, but also an infallible person, praised even for the gossip she spreads, and placed on a superhuman pedestal by the author. She reads minds and knows what people feel, rescues Jews and aids everyone around her despite their exclusion of her in the past. This is, supposedly, the uplifting part of Hegi's work, but imparting angelic qualities to the main character also makes the novel less real. Overall a pleasant reading experience, but not original, and not as profound as The Tin Drum, the other Zwerg World War 2 German novel.	2001-04-05

Kate Chopin captivates her readers with a story of transformation and growth, and writes with clarity and ease. Perhaps most enjoyable about &quot;The Awakening&quot; and Kate Chopin's short stories is the vivid New Orleans setting. Chopin pays attention to the charms of Louisiana in this novel--Creole cooking and language, Southern black and French mannerisms of the time--not limiting herself by focusing on members of the elite. Definitely worth checking out!	2001-02-20
US	50610253	RC5QT3YAATIRH	0452280621	675572194	Beloved	Books	5	4	5	N	N	Mesmerizing!	Toni Morrison explores the depths of maternal love in 'Beloved', and in doing so creates a stunning and unique literary work, fully deserving of the Nobel and Pulitzer prizes it won. After escaping slavery and reestablishing herself in Ohio with her children, Sethe is thrown into a murderous rage when attempts at recapture are made, and kills her eldest child--the only way to ensure her daughter's freedom. The child then returns--as spirit and as full grown woman--to reclaim her mother's love. More than a ghost story, Beloved is a novel about unconditional love, family ties, the enduring scars of slavery, and the strength of a people, when joined as a community, to abolish any form of evil. But it is the writing that makes this novel so special, evoking another time, reading like poetry, and allowing the story to unfold almost like a mystery. Sure, it's no easy read, but it's highly enjoyable and definitely worth it in the end.	2001-01-08

Steinbeck creates angelic characters in Adam and his son Aron, pure evil in Adam's wife Cathy, and a testy coexistence of the two in Caleb and Charles. He strips away the shells of these characters, exposing human nature and its many complexities to the reader. Powerful emotions like love, jealousy, and shame shape the novel and its characters. Steinbeck writes with rugged honesty and incomparable beauty, making East of Eden a treasured American classic.	2000-12-24

By tracing a few conspicuous genetic traits, we follow several family lines through the Norman Conquest, the Reformation, Shakespeare, Elizabethan times, the Industrial revolution, WWII, and everything in between. Although events in the lives of the various family members in the novel is written in such a way as to pique one's interest in the parallel historical events of the time, at the end of the novel no one character stands out. It seems, instead, that the same heros and villians are just reborn every chapter. Nevertheless, this is an enjoyable work of historical fiction that will probably become an enduring classic.	2000-11-17

Newland Archer-the central figure in the novel- is torn between a woman who  represents tradition (and never questions the social order) and the woman  he loves, who challenges the limits of society's tolerance, and seems  oblivious in doing so. Throughout the novel, Archer is beseiged by thoughts  of following his heart, but is drawn by propiety to never break with  tradition. One is reminded of &quot;The House of Mirth&quot;, another great  work by Wharton, in which the central character's social blunder in the  first chapter of the novel results in an irreparable decline into the lower  classes.  <br />Not only does Wharton enlighten the reader on the social codes  of conduct during &quot;The Age of Innocence&quot;, but she also fills the  novel with the dress codes, dining codes, and proper codes of etiquette  which were so important in the daily lives of the members of New York's  high society. This stunning attention to detail really takes the reader to  a different time and place, and it's a fascinating journey.	2000-07-31
