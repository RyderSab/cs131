The loss of control powers loss of just about everything else, especially the lives of the hero and heroine. Alas, the stupidity involved so overwhelms that the saving grace of the latter part of the tale is leached away. <br />Lizzie Fitzgerald has been infatuatedly in love with Lord Tyrell de Warrene since age 10. At 16 she meets him at the de Warrene masquerade ball, where he makes an assignation with her. She does not keep it, but there is a dreadful fruit of that night anyway. Her elder spoilt sister Anna is pregnant and to Tyrell. Sisterly betrayal. Little Miss Lizzie really did not show much intelligence, but now she jettisons whatever she had by claiming the child as her own. Martyr extradinaire! No, just plain daft. Perhaps she wanted what she could get of Tyrell, if she could not have him? Phut. <br />Naturally this nonsense rebounds upon all concerened, when Tyrell is identified as the father and the consquences come home to roost. <br />It is the relationship and stormy sorting out between the pair that picks the painful tale up - but not enough. <br />The sheer stupidity, daftness and later manipulative deceits of Lizzie and the nasty, conniving lust of Tyrell in the beginning of his dealings with her are too much.	2005-09-07

He is, in fact, Geoffrey Dorrington, Earl of Cheriton and heir to the Duke of Passmore. He has previously been the usual careless young sprig about Town, but now is eager to have a purpose in life. <br />The book opens with his dog related meeting with Cassie Hartwell, last unmarried daughter to the local vicar. Her mother is desperate to marry her off, but Cassie is unconcerned regarding her single state. However, that all changes once the handsome new steward arrives and Mrs. Hartwell is none too pleased. Especially as she has been making other arrangements with the local squire regarding his unappealing nephew Rodney Gilbert. <br />A very unexciting, if sweet tale on an old, old theme. Cassie is a nice girl and that's about it, despite the paens of Geoffrey and most of the inhabitants of the area regarding her goodness, sweetness and lightness. <br />The slight plot twist is frankly silly. Cassie betrays her lack of wits by stealing Rodney's pack of hounds one night after she sees him hit one of them. Alas, such a crime in this period would be shockingly serious. Englishmen and their legal system were very hardheaded indeed on the topic of stealing. She plunks herself square into a mess and rather nastily in fact expects Geoffrey to get her out of it.  <br />The foxhound digression apart, the tale was slight. The background characters were almost caricatures, especially Mrs. Hartwell.  <br />A pleasant amusement, but dull at bottom.	2005-08-24

It's a nice positive to the dreaded cut-backs taking place in the Regency genre. <br />This very charming addition is nothing like the Clarke fantasy, being a far lighter, but not less enjoyable, view of the Regency world through a magical glass. <br />Niclas Seymour is a lesser magician member of the ancient magical Seymour family. The Seymours have dwelt in Wales for many centuries and worked hard to establish themselves as powerful in the land through the march of English history, while keeping their magic secret from mortal society. <br />When we meet Niclas, he is nearly at the end of his tether, having been placed under a 'blood curse' by his actions regarding a friend. Thus for years he has been unable to sleep or find any rest. For him this is particularly nasty, as he has the gift of reading thoughts and so he is continually bombarded by the minds of ordinary people. <br />In despair he meets his cousin, Malachai, Lord Graymar, head of the family and the most powerful wizard in Europe and asks for his help regarding a plan. To pay the 'blood' debt his proposes to help Julia Linley, cousin to the man whose blood brought down the curse. Julia is being sent by her family to wrench her Aunt from the clutches of Seymour black sheep Ffinian in Wales. <br />His lost reputation as a Corinthian and eligible gentleman are against him, but he somehow manages to convince Julia's society aunt to act as escort. <br />Julia is in turmoil, as she has been hopelessly in love with Niclas for years, since her disastrous debut when she was an antidote. Now, however, he instantly notices her and is very interested and not just for her beauty. She has a surprising effect on him, he cannot read her thoughts and when she touches him the thoughts of others are calmed. He feels as peace. <br />They set out for Wales and find their way throughunexpected dangers posed by a powerful wizard enemy of the family. <br />Both Niclas and Julia are attractive protaganists. Great to have a magically minded gentleman, not continually in rut or tortured to screaming point by his angst. Niclas is tortured, but he doesn't wallow. <br />The magic is well blended into the real world - done convincingly, believably. <br />The story carries the reader along and sexual tension is there, without taking over the tale. <br />An engrossing read and there's more to come soon. I'll be waiting. <br />	2005-08-18

Though it has nothing to do with Sir Walter Scott's famous poem of this title. <br />Here we have the story of Hector MacLean (twin brother to Lachlan of the previous tale) and his bride by trickery Christina MacLeod. Hector, while pursuing the affairs of the Lord of the Isles, takes shelter during a storm with the MacLeods. MacLeod has seven daughters, the second being the beautiful Mariota who immediately catches Hector's eye. Soon he is asking her father for her in marriage. He, however, has other ideas. First, he thinks his stunning daugher could aim far higher to profit the family and second, he is superstitious and believes his eldest daughter, Christina should marry first. So he appears to agree with Hector to marry Mariota, but deviously manages to hand him his eldest. <br />Christina, for her part, has nursed a yearning for Hector since first seeing him months ago. She is honestly reluctant to aid the deception, but puts up little real fight to her father's bullying exercise of authority. <br />Once Hector awakens the next morning, after falling into the bridal bed drunk, he is livid and all set to annul the marriage. <br />The story moves at a fair pace and keeps one interested to follow the developing attraction and relationship between the pair. A strong political plot underlies it and holds well.  <br />Both main characters are well drawn and we get cameo appearances from Lachlan and Mairi. Christina's sister, Mariota, is revealed as a selfish shrew with a nasty turn of mind.  <br />A good, solid read, strong in romance and adventure	2005-07-30

A definite change from his place in the legends and also the tale diverges from that of Geraint and Enid. In fact it bears very little resemblance to it at all. It has little to do with that tale's portrayal of husbandly mistrust and testing of love. Rather this is another tale of the knight coming to the rescue of a much persecuted lady. <br />The lady in question is Elen who is a daughter of Wales, whose entire family has been murdered by their war-like neighbour Urien. Who tried to force her mother to reject Arthur's overtures and side with his making war against Camelot. Elen herself would have met the same fate, but for her being called into the elvish realm to aid its queen in a dangerous childbirth. <br />At the back of Urien is Morgaine the evil enchantress who is also his lover. She sees Elen's own magic as a threat and horrifically imprisons her heart in the breast of a hawk. Elen is also under the behest of whoever controls the bird - Urien. <br />Somehow she uses her magic to send a massage to Merlin, begging Arthur's aid. He promptly sends Agravaine and Geraint. <br />Geraint, however, is determined to do more than gather information and becomes Elen's saviour. After their escape they then quest for a magic spear to free Elen and kill Urien. <br />This a fast tale, full of wonderfully realized magic that is both believable and dreadful. Elen and Geraint move through several realms and have to grope their way through many deceits and the machinations of various powers on their quest. <br />So now I am again left waiting eagerly for part three. Agravaine next I hope. <br />	2005-07-02

Finally I have been able to get a hold of it and found it to be far better than most of these reviewers have allowed. <br />Daphne is indeed a young woman who allowed a shocking experience to cloud her life for ten years. However I do not think this damns her as a believable or sympathetic heroine. I suspect this violent antipathy by critics to be more a case of modern sensibility being unable to cope with a revulsion for sex by a very young girl's experience. Maybe a trifle too strong, but understandable under Daphne's circumstances. For her grandfather leaves her to hide from it and so the problem is left to fester until first, she meets Lord Alexander and second, her grandfather finally realises his own mortality. <br />From then on, she is pushed and pulled into the real world and does indeed grow from her enforced private world that had no counter to the folly experience. <br />Oliver does this well, if a trifle fast. The diary plays a role here to reveal Daphne's progress. It also helps in her final resolution with Alexander.	2005-07-02

I saw much praise and looked forward to reading it. Unfortunately I was badly disappointed. If you liked Baroness Orczy's classic, be warned. This is a pale, irritating copy. I though Guy C. Clayton's attempt to use the book downright annoying, but at least it held together as a story. <br />It's a story within a story. Eloise Kelly travels in England to pursue research regarding secret agents of the Revolutionary era, specifically the Scarlet Pimpernel and his successors, the Purple Gentian and the Pink Carnation. She is given papers relating to the latter two, by a descendent of Sir Richard Selwick, the Purple Gentian.  <br />The inset tale then unfolds. Amy Balcourt has burned to pursue a life of adventure for years, having, with her mother, escaped the French Revolution. So when her brother invites her home during the peace she jumps at the chance, accompanied by cousin Jane and chaperone Miss Gwen. They soon meet Selwick on the boat to France. There follows much burbling between Amy and Selwick from their instant attraction. The nature of Selwick's masquerade also dictates an instant antipathy, when Amy discovers he associates with Bonoparte. The tale continues through much chit chat between the pair of an allegedly witty nature. It also lurches along in great leaps of adventure that are absurd. <br />We meet the brother involved in something nefarious with a shady Englishman who is suspected of being the Gentian. We then meet Bonoparte and Josephine at her salon and are subjected to a nonsensical scene involving him and Miss Gwen berating him. My patience, already being tried, became stretched. <br />The further adventures of Amy defy logic and belief. She listens at doors, is let loose in the Tuilleries, finds secret papers, jumps from second storey windows nary a scratch, meets men at midnight without thought and nearly is seduced in a boat. She's a first class pain. More hair than wit. Jane was far more interesting. <br />Danger abounds but is far too easily overcome to be taken seriously.  <br />Richard is marginally better than Amy, but as soon as he kisses her, whilst on his mission, his brains leak out and he never recovers them.  <br />This is not romantic adventure, it's a risible romp. <br />Read the original, it's got more true adventure, suspense and romance for all its age. <br />	2005-06-15

Both she and the tale are dramatically introduced, as she is speeding to her father's court on Isla to stop the hanging of an innocent man. Here, she meets Lachlan Maclean and his brother Hector. She and Lachlan are immediately attracted. Lachlan, however, is attracted to more than her spirit and beauty. He is ambitious for both his clan and himself. Marrying Mairi is attractive in every possible way to Lachlan the Wily, a man very much of his times. <br />The Lord of the Isles had other, dynastic, ideas for his daughter's marriage involving an alliance with the Royal House. <br />The tale that follows involves much clan intrigue and plotting for power, as the romance races ahead of events and Lachlan tries to control both. <br />It is a well told tale. The romance runs without doubt. Lachlan is an especially believable man, with an eye to ambition and the lady. Mairi is attractive, her only real trouble being that she loses all her intelligence when Lachlan and her attraction to him is involved. Melts into a puddle actually. <br />She recovers a bit of her spirit when Lachlan reveals his calculating side, but I still felt she let the man walk all over her. <br />A fast moving adventure, with the romance perhaps taking a second place to the plotting of clan Maclean. <br />	2005-05-17

Mystery, a desperate hero, disillusioned heroine, the supernatural, enforced closeness ... Sounded good, possibly engrossing. <br />Alas, expectations were gravely disappointed. Gravely. <br />Lady Victoria Wakefield, a cyncial spinster of 32, confronts Byron, the Duke of Raeburn to wipe out her brother's gaming debt to him. However, there's more to the 'debt' than meets the eye. Byron has another, more serious, connection to the brother, that fires him to want revenge. He also has a mysterious, unnamed secret of a personal nature. Hints of the supernatural here. <br />He makes a 'devil's' bargain with our heroine. <br />The stage is set for an explosive, exploration of hero and heroine by each other within the claustrophobic atmosphere of dark night and darker passion. <br />Except it didn't do that. It just was yet another tale of the heroine sacrificing her 'all' for her family. Actually it didn't do that either, as the lady was more interested in her own arid desires. Altogether too modern and no thought for the consequences. <br />A lot of bedroom steaming, but no romance alas. No meeting of anything, but bodies. <br />The dark mystery also slumped. <br />A disappointment on all counts. <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-05-09

Alas neither past, nor promise is fulfilled. <br />Esme, Lady Iddesford is a mysterious young woman of a highly exotic, and scarlet reputation. Benedict Hadley is a charming, young lord of impeccable reputation. They meet during the London Season under confusing circumstances. Each is pursuing uncomfortble aims for family reasons. She is attempting to thwart the courtship of her step-grandaughter Jane by the villainous Letellier. He is attempting to keep an eye on the man on the instructions of his father. Their aims clash and an instant attraction pulls them together. <br />Benedict is confused by her pull and beauty, not to mention the mystery of her contradictory actions. She is horrified by her attraction to him, she who has been detached from men and able to manipulate them. <br />Yes, this all sound good, but the tale is lost in a mist, no a thick fog, of the telling. There is way too much showing and little telling. We are put into both Benedict's mind and Esme's thoughts far too often and as a result are awash in their opinions. There is no clear thread. Oddly enough, all this showing does not show us anything about the other characters. We are told about Letellier's villainy, the father's coldness, etc, but nothing is truly shown of them.  <br />I finished the book, but felt I had been dragged to do so. It angered me in the end. Especially Esme, who was supposed to be a wronged woman, but truly ended up being a shrill creature who enjoyed feeling wronged and manipulating men to satisfy her sense of ill-usage. I know that was not the author's intent, but Esme was a pain. Mind, Benedict was only marginally better, wallowing as he did in his own sense of ill-usage over his father. <br />Not good and disappointing from a previously fine author	2005-04-26

They travel to London and the Unicorn Bank to put a stop to it and fail. Ellie's father commits suicide and she is left destitute. She is alone in the world apart from a missing uncle. <br />She meets, by chance, Lord Griffin. They are mesmerised by each other and he kisses her. Athan, Lord Griffin is stunned by her, as she is the image of a painting in his possession. A very improper painting. Neither think to meet again.  <br />Then Ellie finds her Uncle John, who co-incidentally, lives on Griffin's Welsh estate trying to make a living making fine china.  <br />There are several complications. Athan is almost engaged to a young woman under his care, Fleur Tudor - who is not what she seems. However, it is the melodramatic machinations of the Russian, Prince Paul Dalmatsky involving revenge and a stolen diamond that really drive the plot. <br />The romance, alas, really takes second place. It is very much 'at first sight' and the tale of the portrait is over complicated, confusing and (at bottom) faintly ridiculous. There are several scenes of psychic connection between the pair that have a very good romantic charge. However, Ellie's being in the presence of others at these times, negates their appeal. There's no real romance between them, of discovery and doubt and fears regarding each other. <br />The tale moves well, is full of drama, but is not Heath at her best. Not enough feeling, maybe, between the hero and heroine.	2005-04-21

The new Viscount, having waited long enough in his opinion, wants her gone and the house available for his residence. To that end he sends his wastrel brother Sir Charles to remove her and Delphine with all possible speed. In fact he forces Charles to do this, as Charles is badly in debt due to his ruinous lifestyle of gambling and drinking. Charles has also been the butt of much cruelty through his club foot and been thwarted in his ambition to be in the army. <br />Thus our stage is set. <br />This is a well written, interesting and moving romance. Interesting, in that it upends our usual ideas about this type of situation. For usually the widow with a child being forced from her home has all our sympathy and the man evicting her is cast as a villain for so doing. However, during the course of the tale, we discover such not to be the case. The new viscount has waited for her to leave, she is not destitute, she has a perfectly good home to which to remove, she has a good income. Nell is being unreasonable, but I don't think, desptite this unreasonableness, that her thoughts and actions are unbelievable, maybe foolish ... She seems to have been under great mental stress and is only just beginning to emerge from beneath her husband's heavy handed treatment. She has been clinging to familiarity and cannot see out of her well worn groove. <br />Similarly, Charles is also jolted from his pattern. As he leaves London, we can see his dissatisfaction with his ruinous, pointless life and once at Meadow House he is able to do more than moan. He is already rejecting that and wants to change. He is seen as looking back upon his childhood pain and understanding it, he is putting that bitterness behind him.  <br />Both he and Nell are wounded characters who are struggling to burst from the past and their steps forward are made more surely by their developing relationship. For they are undeniably attracted to each other almost from the first. <br />Only Nell's reaction to discovering Charles' reasons for acting for his brother is overdone. <br />A beautifully realized romance. <br />	2005-04-11

The romance between the enforcably married couple is charming and tender, but pushed very much to the sidelines by the machinations of the nasty Elkin, the equally nasty Walter and their various, vicious henchmen.

He of course is no such thing, being Captain Lord Nathan Christopher Thornton, younger son of a duke. He has been, reluctantly, assigned to the orders of the Earl of Rutherford, Allyson's father.  He would far rather be back with the army, having just recovered from recent wounds. Now, however, he must protect Allyson in the guise of a footman. <br />Neither are happy with the situation, to him she's a spoilt young lady of the ton, to her he's an annoyance dogging her every step and curbing her independence. <br />A familiar story, but there is far more bursting out all over the place. Allyson is visited by a child ghost of the family, Maryvictoria, who trys to advise her in the most irritating ways and appears at the most awkward times. She is indeed irritating to us as well, but proves useful to resolve a dangerous situation near the end. Then Allyson is also a crusader for the fallen women. <br />Not to be outdone by her, Nathan has an enormous chip on his shoulder about his father and brother. The usual 'you don't care because I'm different' rant alas. Both father and brother appear and the brother is soundly panned. He also complicates the plot by aspiring to Allyson's hand in a very luke-warm dynastic way. <br />There are political complications of the Earl and blackmailing of the countess. <br />All a bit much and the romance is suffering as a result. <br />It was entertaining and went at a fair clip, but just too busy.  <br />	2005-02-26

A very eccentric lady who is trying to establish a moral lending library and has Prudence doing cataloguing work. She soon meets her son Alwyn who is trying to establish himself as an architect. <br />How their romance develops with the help of a cat and her kittens is the tale. <br />A very sparse, stretched one. The characters are sketched well initially, but never develop any character past those first impressions. Other bits and pieces of plot points are thrown in and never properly developed. One about Prudence somehow writing an advice column just hangs. It nearly finished a chapter early and some machinations by Prudence's mother rounded it off in a very odd way. The final plot twists were mere flashed images of the high points of a forced return, a horrid marriage plan and a swift rescue by Alwyn. <br />There was a certain custard pie, fun humour to the writing that should have been left to develop, but just did not. It became the basis of the story, and shrill instead of the entertaining telling of the tale. <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-02-22

Fenella is pleased, and also much intrigued by Giles herself. <br />It works and soon Dora and Charlie are married. <br />Then some months later, friends alert Fenella to Charlie's odd behaviour. He is planning to lease Yelden Hall - this is disturbing as the family knows Dora is longing to return to the country for the imminent birth of their first child. <br />Fenella decides to investigate on her visit to London for a season, but once there begins to discover that the marriage is not all roses. Charlie is keeping secrets from Dora, pursues a hectic social life apart from her, is worryingly close to Constance Maxfield ... However, Fenella also meets the exciting Giles once more. <br />The story then unfolds through the discovery of the troubled marriage, Charlie's gambling and Fenella's determined pursuit of the truth. Giles is soon involved and they both realize their attraction. Though Fenella resists it, due to her discovery of his rakish past and worry that he is aiding the corruption of Charlie. <br />Fenella is a particularly sympathetic and well drawn character, although her youthful confusion is exhibited most tellingly in foolish behaviourand a determined mistrust of Giles. She almost destroys her relations with Giles because of it and her mulish refusal to trust him. Giles also is a believably written man, who has outgrown youthful folly, yet retains his air of danger and is a fitting counter to the heroine.  <br />Tragedy does more than touch the story before its conclusion, but it does not end it and leave the reader with a dark doomed conclusion.  <br />Highly recommended <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-02-21

It did not really help set the period, the creation of which was very patchy. <br />Eloise Hamelin is left in confusion, by the departure of her father Sir John, after his being charged with treason. The Earl of Kenworth soon arrives, along with Sir Roland St. Marten to pursue the matter. Kenworth obviously has a personal axe to grind and knows more about the affair. Roland is sent by King Edward to manage the estate in the interim. <br />Spice is added to the mix, by the earlier acrimony between Eloise and Roland from the non-marriage of her to his half-brother Hugh. The tale then trots along a bit bumpily to machinations and plots, as Eloise escapes to help her father and Roland pursues.  <br />It's not a bad story, but the predictability overwhelms -especially as regards the spirited Eloise. She has the label 'feisty' written all over her and was the least medieval of ladies and allegedly perfect to all and sundry. Then there was the way the pair finally fell into each other's arms ... <br />Not unpleasant, but very creaky.	2005-02-12

This is a book I have been wanting to read for some time - it being Savery's first romance published some years ago in hardback.<br /><br />With all that build up, bad things are all too likely, but thank goodness I was not disappointed. This is a uniformly enjoyable book.<br /><br />Lady Ardith Winter is the last of the Winter roses of the title, being the youngest of four sisters. They all were successful debutantes in London due to their blonde beauty. Alas, Ardith is completely different, dark, tall and outspokenly intelligent. As a result of this difference she has an outsize conviction of her own ugliness, much compounded by her disastrous season in London some years ago. Now she lives in happy, busy independence breeding horses, with her companion on the estate left to her by her aunt Sibley.<br /><br />Then her father wrecks it all by a stupid outburst after the birth of yet another grandaughter. He will pay 10,000 pounds to the daughter who will produce a grandson. This brings out the worst in his sons-in-law and there hangs the tale.<br /><br />For St. John, the Marquis of Rohampton, then re-enters Ardith's life. The disastrous London season crashed due to an awful scene involving his proposal to her. She thinks he played a cruel joke and he, utterly sincere, was devasted by her total rejection of him in the years since.<br /><br />Now he takes new heart and decides to slowly win her back.<br /><br />How he does so makes an engrossing read. There are good secondary characters, the blustering father, the silly sisters and their dim husbands, even if they are at times a trifle one dimensional.<br /><br />My only niggle, was that Ardith was too determined in her conviction of her own lack of attraction and so treated St. John quite badly as a result.	2005-01-29

I had misgivings about this book when I saw the title, but pushed them away with the interest of the story premise. However, I should have listened - an alleged twist on an Austen title is often an indicator of bad things. <br />Lady Eleanor Griffin decides she has had enough of being confined by her brothers and her position. She wants fun.  <br />Enter Valentine, Marquis of Deverill, a friend of her eldest brother, set to keep an eye on her. He is a typical rake who is now put in a quandry by his position of trust to this young lady who is also fast becoming an object of desire. <br />Well this all sounded good, Valentine sounded good. Alas it was not good. At all. <br />It was chiefly Eleanor, she was just too, too much the modern heroine dressed in Regency costume posturing against a wallpaper regency background. She was simply not believable for a young lady of the time, apart from the fact that she was immature, with more hair than wit. She wanted to have 'fun' and apparently gets what she wanted with Valentine with no thought for the consequences.   <br />Unrealistic. <br />	2005-01-08

When the wicked ones travel to London, she makes further discoveries through the stirring of her own fire magic and the help of her stepmother, the village witch/nurse. <br />At the same time Reginald Fenyx, an Air Master returns home scarred in both body and mind by the war and a horrifying accident involving his torture by earth elementals. <br />The scene is set for romance and drama, as Reggie and Eleanor find each other and fight their own demons and the evil Allison. <br />This was a gripping tale, the only thing wrong was that the author made 'the mixture too rich' and tried to jam in far too much. Too much of every conceivable type of magic, and also too much of trying to also be a social commentary. <br />Minor niggles, but they did detract from the story.	2005-01-05

The characters are sympathetic, but not portrayed as in any way approaching perfection. Both defects and virtues are presented in a natural, real way. They are more than mere cardboard figures manipulated by the author. <br />Both hero and heroine are strong characters, but although they of course they are obviously set to clash over the Belevedere Tower, they do not behave with pig-headed stupidity. As all too often does occur in historical romance fiction. <br />True, there is a strong element of melodrama with Cassandra's husband's violent return, but it was not foolishly far-fetched. <br />Daniel was particularly well rounded, for in the beginning he definitely had forfeited some reader sympathy by is treatment of his mistress. However, his very real growth as the book progressed showed this was not a permanent fault of character.  <br />	2005-01-04

Their first meeting is fraught with wrong impressions, but Hebe realizes her error. He is not arrogant, but exhausted and indeed seems to be some kind of army agent. <br />They are mutually attracted and meet again. All seems set fine for a romance and a passionate kiss on a balcony is exchanged. Then Alex receives a letter from England, it is an acceptance by a lady to his proposal of some months ago. The romance is shattered. <br />Both are full of mistaken feelings and misunderstandings. Then Hebe sails for England with her newly married stepmother. Alex of course is on the same ship.  <br />Alas the ship is engulfed by a storm and the whole tale is wrenched off course. Hebe, for all her prior good sense, goes up on deck and she and Alex are swept overboard.  <br />The tale never recovers. <br />In fact it gets worse. I did not think it possible, but each page just increased the velocity of its descent. <br />Alex is ill, they walk for miles in a suspiciously short time, they hide in a oddly handy hut of Alex's for his missions, a French troop somehow arrives... <br />Alex and Hebe were very good characters and they also seem to descend into the cardboard realms. <br />Such a shame, but the story was ruined by bad melodrama. <br />	2004-12-31

Very much a fantasy tale too, despite it being marketed by the new Luna imprint which is supposed to be romance and fantasy. In some of the titles the balance has been maintainted, others the romance has dominated, but here the romance has been definitely in the background.  <br />A complex tale trying to encompass several characters at the same time in interweaving points of view. It makes engrossing reading, but it does detract severely from reader sympathy. Many of the protagonists are most unattractive, even when the author twists our tails and shows us the other side of an apparent villain. <br />The world of entwined magic across the worlds of the Sidhe and mortals in well done and engrossing. There is horror too in spades with the flesh eating evil of the goblins. <br />Good but not great. The mixture is often too rich.

There was much that was good, but there was much to counterbalance and drag it down.  <br />The Duke of Alban, disillusioned with life, leaves Brighton to visit his favourite aunt. Alban is wary and cynical regarding women. His wife ran away with a lover and his most recent mistress was playing a double game with him. Three men accompany him, an old friend, a social acquaintance and a slight acquaintance who somehow tagged along. Unbeknownst to him, his aunt has become blind and very much needs her companion, Mrs. Kittie Douglas. <br />Kittie is a widow in need of employment, due to her dead husband's gambling. She has an unrealistically noble picture of Alban, as she has been reading his letters to his aunt. Of course he appears all that is good and she suspects she is more than a little in love with this idealised picture. Hardly surprising that she should immediately be strongly attracted to him when they meet. <br />He finds himself similarly drawn to her. However, his thoughts are not at all honourable. He feels torn between his instinctive desire to seduce her and his conscience telling him he should not, because of her position. <br />The second man, Lord Orkeney muddies the waters, by immediately flirting with Kittie. <br />Two friends of Kittie's then arrive to complicate relationships with the other two men. Spring might have been in the air. <br />Basically this is a story of how Alban and Kittie fight within themselves regarding their deep attraction. He wants her, but will not consider marriage. She wants him, but cannot reconcile herself to being a mistress - to her it is an insult and debasement. <br />Orkeney is all the time complicating the issue, on purpose as is obvious. He is lying to both of them. Alban may have wanted excuses to see Kittie as being open to being his mistress, but he does see behaviour that is strong evidence to that effect. Here Kittie is astonishingly stupid. <br />A strong story, but I really could not get to like Kittie and Alban more than tepidly. They were both so bristling with resentments and suspicions. Maybe being so privy to their thoughts made it a bit too claustrophobic. <br />There were also several secondary plot threads that were created and showed promise of interest, but then were not developed. A pity.  <br />The ending was good and made up for some of the sluggish internalising of hero and heroine. <br />As usual Simpson recreates the era convincingly. The characters do actually think as such men and women of the period would have done.	2004-08-14

Not at all the usual Regency tale of romance in a social setting of the town or country. The love story very much took a back seat to the story of the Leprechaun, as I suppose was indicated by the title itself.  <br />Beth Longford forces herself into the house of her cousin John, the Earl of Wayneathe to try and obtain his help to save her beloved forest, the Heartwood, at the family estate. Her father the Baron is ruthlessly chopping the ancient forest down for the money and out of revenge on John, who is his heir following the death of his son Terence. <br />John is holding a riotous orgy and is not pleased to have to see Beth at all, indeed he takes a few minutes to even recognize her. He has been pursuing this hedonistic existence to blot out the pain of losing his family. A soldier he had already fought at Waterloo and there had his cousin Terence shot beside him and his mother and brothers were soon after killed in a fire. He wants to escape and have no more of love or responsibility. <br />Beth of course wants him to act to the contrary. She tries to persuade him, and eventually leaves in despair of the fate of her woods. For not only are they in danger, but also the leprecaun, Shawn. <br />He is a secret she shared with John and her grandparents. John now does not believe in him. <br />John eventually finds he cannot forget his duties after all, nor the lovely cousin. He travels to the family seat to confront the Baron. <br />The bad Baron father is all that and more, vicious, drunk, despises his wife, a gamester who has tried to sell his daughter twice. Very unpleasant. <br />Shawn is an interesting creature, with a tragic tale of his own lost love that is a thread running through the story. <br />The stage is set. <br />Very dramatic and very much a story with a strong environmental message. This was done well, but it stuck out as an extremely modern take on the subject. I almost expected Beth to set up a protest tent or chain herself to a tree. <br />Unfortunately this is why the love story suffers. It is more a case of he falls in love with Beth and we do not see how or why. <br />Oh they are both good characters, convincingly drawn, sympathetic, believable.  <br />An enjoyable tale - just more love would have been better.	2004-08-07

The author tries hard, but the poor things are not in any way sympathetic. Angarred is a particularly unattractive young woman for a heroine. She is supposed to be free spirited and interesting, but alas she is simply a selfish little pain. One could not feel much pity for one so self-obsessed.

Armed as the black knight and aided only by the ex-novice monk Baldwin, she is fuelled by a furious thirst for vengeance against the evil de Morte brothers, authors of her suffering. <br />At the opening of the tale, she has already dispatched one, quickly chops up a second and then rides on for the remaining trio. With all the much vaunted evil of these fallen angels, Seraphim's defeat of them is just not believable, it is far too easy. <br />On the road to vengeance, she encounters Dominique San Juste. He is a changeling faery desperately seeking his own origins, who joins her for that end. He is definitely the best part of the tale. Interesting, haunted, handsome, magical etc. etc. Far too good for the slightly cardboard Sera. She is described in glowing terms as being so very wonderful, but unfortunately she is not that at all. <br />There is a good deal of horror enmeshed in the story, of the nasty slimy type. The way in which the next two demons are dispatched is more than revolting.  <br />Secrets of both Sera and Dominique eventually emerge on the journey and then in the final confrontation with the most evil brother, Lucifer. <br />A shame so much promise was lost in the mix.	2004-07-24

Raine is in fact twelve 'crowns' or lands at a very uncertain point in its history. The king is dead and his young daughter Tessera is being crowned queen. The mage Vevay, chief counsellor to the king, fears she cannot rule well and hold the realm together. <br />Tessera is strangely apart from her duties and almost seems simple-minded. <br />At the same time, a book written in a strange 'alphabet of thorns' is put into Nepenthe's hands for translation. She should have simply handed it to the librarians, but instead she secretly kept it for her own work by some strange compulsion and attraction she felt for this alphabet. <br />As Nepenthe is drawn ever more fascinatedly into the book (an ancient saga of Axis, Emperor of the Night and Kane his infinitely powerful sorcerer), so too is the security of Raine brought into question by powers both tangible and, even more dangerously, intangible and magical. <br />A sleeping king rises to warn of terrible danger, magic awakens in the confused Tessera, a mysterious wood with a life of its own draws wanderers in, evil leaps from history into the present ... <br />McKillip's prose always flows and eddies to draw in the reader's attention and almost make one read faster to catch its meanings. This tale is not nearly so dense and fey as some others. Yet, it also is full of ideas only glimpsed and a rich world that is not merely skimmed over as a mere background. <br />This is a finely realized, beautiful tale.	2004-07-24

However, the Viscount was accompanied by his friend Peregrine Campion - a wealthy man of trade who made his fortune in India. He almost immediately see straight through Judith's little plots and is determined to thwart the fortune huntress.<BR>This is a very familiar premise with a slight entertaining twist. The tale moves fast, and the background is very lightly sketched. Characterisations are convincing, if a little broadly done in places. <BR>Judith is very much modelled on Heyer's Frederica, the managing, elder sister who is determined to launch a reluctant, compliant younger one. She is only a pale imitation of course, and also ever so slightly stupid. She just cannot imagine she will not marry the Viscount on the strength of one short house party. For all that, she is likable.<BR>Peregrine is also a likable gentleman, even if his friendship with Westfall is not altogether convincing. He has a tortured past, which takes over the second half of the book. Its resolution and his developing relationship with Judith actually better than the initial premise setting up the plot.<BR>There are many good things here, but there is a good deal to off-set them. Clunking plot devices abound, characters are introduced and disappear when they have fulfilled their purpose (a maid is ill and needs devoted nursing, a young lady is a rival, a gossipy nasty). Peregrine's history in India is dumped into the middle of the tale and sits there like a too-rich fruit cake by slowing down the story. <BR>Entertaining, but uneven. Shows promise	2004-07-19

There is nary a drawing room or high perch phaeton in sight and the nearest society miss is definitely a long way off stage in the far background of this rollicking high adventure.<BR>Maggie Bonner is companion to Alice Fescue, a young lady recently betrothed to Lord Barkin. While travelling to join him on his distant Hebridean Island estate, the lady decamps and it is left to Maggie to return the betrothal gift of the valuable Barkin Emeralds to the earl. Then everything is turned on its head, first she is robbed of the emeralds by a seeming pirate and then she is kidnapped to the island of St. Columba. <BR>Gulliver McGuigan is no pirate, but a desperate man trying to grab the attention of Barkin to help save the island and its people from an ever more quickening slide into poverty.<BR>Naturally there is plenty of spark between the spirited pair, as Maggie angrily tries to convince him she is not Barkin's betrothed. Of course attraction soon spices up the mix of fast-paced action. Maggie and Gulliver are a realistic pair and it is a pleasure to follow their interaction.<BR>This is a very enjoyable and eminently readable tale. The romance is not too much pushed to the edges by the action and blend in well. Maybe the romance simply springs into being too quickly considering the few days involved, without any development, but that's a quibble regarding realism and not writing.<BR>Secondary characters, Gulliver's cousin Dorcas and Lord Barkin, are also well realized, if not given much page space.<BR>Great stuff.	2004-07-12

Dustfinger is a most sympathetic creation, so terribly out of place and torn from the moorings of his own world.

He is fascinated by the university and its scholarship, if not its prejudices and professors. Then Jane Brailsford sweeps onto the scene. She is a witch, a very feminist one, who is a teacher at the female magical college in France of Greenlaw. She is at Glasscastle not just to harry her professor brother Robert, but to persuade Nicholas Fell (the most eccentric of eccentrics) to take up his post as Warden of the West.<BR>The tale then takes off with great velocity, nearly as fast and enthusiastically as Jane does in her brother's motor car as she sets about her tasks. For there is more going on in England than meets the eye, there is something wrong with magic itself and Fell is determined to refuse his post until he can heal the problem.<BR>The whole magical world created by Stevermer is wonderfully realized and believable through its grounding in realities. Magic is presented as a strong part of this world without too much oohing and aahing. <BR>Then the characters of Lambert and Jane are so well presented, and so very engaging. They strike sparks off each other, but are never shrill or stupid or unnecessarily argumentative. Jane resents the stupid prejudices against women, but does not belay the point continually. She simply goes ahead regardless, but is not revoltingly feisty.<BR>The mysteries and dangerous plots are full of surprises, but not so obscure as to defy our puzzlings. There is a choice of villains and a great piece of villainy in the Agincourt weapon itself.

At the same time, she inexplicably helps save the outlaw Rath who literally comes crashing into her life. She dislikes everything about him.<BR>The scene is set for a 'quest' tale, with the Maura and Rath struggling alone to fulfill her task. They are pursued by the evil magicians of the Han throughout. <BR>The pair of course are irresistibly attracted to each other, but are firmly kept apart by Maura's strong devotion to her Waiting King.<BR>This was an enjoyable read, the story easily kept the reader's interest. However the plot itself suffered from being continually bogged down by the 'saving' of hero and heroine by each other. Maura get captured by thieves. Rath is captured by the Han. It clogged the pace.<BR>Both Rath and Maura were believable and the chemistry between them was well done. This contributed to the feeling that the love story was much more to the fore than the fantasy elements. The background of Umbria was very lightly sketched in indeed, and in places became mere wallpaper. There are really no secondary characters at all, Langbard is ruthlessly eliminated very early in the tale. This made the hero and heroine carry a far too heavy burden, as almost every other character was merely a name and a few cardboard virtues or vices.<BR>Still, I would like to know what happens next, as there is very obviously more in this saga	2004-06-29

His lawyer has interesting news for him - to be sure he is to inherit a good deal of money necessary for the running of the estate from both his father and grandmother. However... there are some very nasty strings attached to each and the said strings are pulling against each other. His father's will impels him to marry a 'lady' who attends his cousin's forthcoming marriage within a month or lose his unentailed inheritance to his cousin. If that is not enough, his grandmother's will grimly requires him to remain celibate for 100 days to teach him a moral lesson! Robert is not amused.<BR>Fate, though, rescues him from a fate worse than death with a nasty cousin in the person of Miss Jemima Jewell, an unexpected 'guest' at the wedding. Very unexpected - as she is the daughter of a master sweep who attends as a part of one of the 'traditional' superstitions attached to the wedding. She is also a 'lady', due to the fact of her education as one at the hands of Mrs. Montagu's school. The by-product of this has also been her own alienation from her origins, especially her father who is wanting to marry her off to his own advantage.<BR>The pair are instantly attracted. Robert eventually persuades her to make a marriage 'in name only' and she agrees to find her own independance. Then fate tweaks the tale again and the marriage becomes real. They travel to his country estate - they both begin to know each other and discover their roles.<BR>This is a most charming tale, despite all the blind eyes one must turn to the improbabilites of trick wills, noblemen marrying sweep's daughters and daft lawyers.<BR>Robert and Jemimna are believable and very sympathetic characters. Jemima is especially wary of him and his station, her gradual acceptance of the reality of his sincerity is well done. Poor Robert's double bind is stretched out to create a good deal of sexual tension between the pair. <BR>Jemima's brother is also swept into the tale involving a murder, highway robbery and yet another unlikely romance.<BR>All highly charged - very entertaining, but definitely requiring a grave suspension of reality.	2004-06-19

In despair she flees her home and, in desperate straits with the dark wizard, is rescued by Gawain.<BR>The story then continues with their journey to Camelot, with much magic, danger and battle along the way. <BR>Euberacon, however, also has other deeper plans for Camelot and is involved with other dark, malevolent powers wanting to overthrow Arthur. There is a particularly nasty witchy Kerra, who has a slimy relationship with ravens.<BR>Two of the tales relating to Gawain are used here, those involving the Green Knight and The Loathly Lady. The first is particularly well realized, but the second rather falls down.<BR>An engaging take on Arthurian legend. Also the first of a projected series involving Gawain's brothers. I'll definitely be reading them, being particularly curious about the dour Agravaine.	2004-06-08

Most unpleasant to say the least.<BR>Edmund's heir is his cousin Lucas, a naval Captain who had been forced into the service by his family, after some youthful wild oat sowing scandals in the neighbourhood. He did not want to be in the navy, but found his feet - now he does not want to be land-locked. He is especially hamstrung by the reputation of his youth, which has made him into a rake to be avoided at all costs. This is not helped by his cousin's own very slimy behaviour towards every female in the district, as well as his delinquencies regarding the estate. A tough introduction, especially when the neighbourhood gossips are out in full force!<BR>Penelope is by way of being his greatest help, very much against her will - but not her attraction to him. She has been allegedly mourning the death of her betrothed some years ago at Salamanca, while also looking after her dead sister's twins, ruthlessly left in her care by her brother-in-law. Her status as permanently bereaved is however a smokescreen to protect herself from men.<BR>These two are believable characters, drawn with enough depth to give us insight into them. Penelope is extremely wary of Lucas, due to his shockingly over the top reputation and her own resistance to the pull of his charm. Every woman appears to her to be all too easily mown down by his smile and easy manner.<BR>Their mutual game of one step forward and two steps back is not too overdone to become annoying. <BR>This is pulled along irresistably by the necessity of finding the murderer - as the neighbourhood has viciously decided Lucas is prime suspect (after all one vice muct breed all the rest).<BR>One oddity, however, was the way Penelope's parents were portayed. The father was not there at all, while the mother waspresented as lost in a book all the time. Most odd - and made one wonder just how did Penelope grow up so sensibly in the first place.<BR>A good, pleasantly enjoyable read - not a nasty jolt anywhere regarding modernity.	2004-06-07

As a result I gave it the middling option of 3 stars.<BR>The premise is one common to Regencies. The unmonied titled hero has to marry the untitled monied heroine. Here it is Lord Michael Lyndon and Chloe Russell. Chloe, alas, had been spitefully nicknamed &quot;Miss Bumblebroth&quot; by society and suffered for it during her season. She withdrew herself from further hurt, but now her brother and sister-in-law have arranged her marriage to Michael. He, also, has been dragooned into the matter by his father the Earl to bring in much needed money for their estates.<BR>Chloe might be clumsy, but she's no fool and amusingly attempts to give him a disgust of her at their first meeting (where he is to propose). She also paints and is busy making a fortune unbeknownst to her family. A believable sympathetic young lady.<BR>Michael is similarly well drawn and instantly likable - not a rake or a dandy, but a Corinthian who has been straining at the fatherly leash that has kept him from his desire to run the family estate of Chimneys.<BR>There is instant attraction on both their parts and although both had intended to negate the whole matter, they find themselves wanting to be married.<BR>So they marry and discover each other and their hidden sorrows. Chloes anguish as being tormented as a child by her cousins and brother is really brought far more to the fore than the tragic history that Michael hides. Really, it seemed her pain ought to have paled into insignificance at that which was haunting him and his parents, and definitely tainting his relationship with his father. Chloe kept on falling back on her clumsiness and needing constant reassurance from him, and going about quailing at her cousin Edwin. When we discovered the reasons behind this fear of Edwin, I felt deflated and asked 'Is that all?'. One suspected something far worse.<BR>Chloe's problems just pushed Michaels into the background and his recovery through her advice was made into a few vague lines regarding unseen events. A let down. Maybe this was due to the publisher's restraints regarding the length of the book, as there were other side issues that seemed cut short to the detriment of the story and its characters. The ending itself suffered badly in this respect.<BR>The supposedly dirty dish, Edwin, I felt definitely was hard done by. He really had the potential to be an interesting character, but was shoved aside by Michael's desire to pummel him at every turn for so much as glancing at Chloe. Why does assault and battery at the hands of the hero deserve applause, when the exact behaviour from the semi-villain curry contempt?<BR>As I said I enjoyed most of this story - well written for the most part, good characters, a believable recreation of Regency society.	2004-06-05

This is a well created world of Aronsdale, actually a small kingdom set within a wider world of which we are only given small glimpses. Charm Headwind was plucked from a happy life because of her magical mage abilities. Muller Dawnfield was forced into his role as heir to his uncle King Doran after the death of his son and grandson. Accordingly they are meant to wed for the sake of Aronsdale. However, a new possible female mage is found in the person of Iris and then the plot thickens and deepens with the discovery by her of Jarid the true heir to the throne. The kingdom is then threatened by the more powerful neighbouring kingdom of Harsdown and an evil dark mage. <BR>The love stories are well to the fore and are presented with a sensitive touch. All four lovers are sympathetic and each has a different set of personal demons to grapple with and overcome.<BR>The story kept me reading, it had suspense and well drawn secondary characters in support. I will look forward to another tale set in this world - there are several vague loose ends that appear set to be picked up to that end.<BR>However, there were frequent jarring phrasings and words that ought to have been ironed out by the editorial process. The villain was also set up in an interesting way, but at the end the entire premise collapsed most unconvincingly. Indeed the final scenes regarding the fate of Harsdown were irritating, especially after so much that was good.	2004-06-04

Julia is obsessed with her horses and wants to keep both them and control of their welfare, but her father is ill and will not make it easy - he desires her marriage. Henry has a young daughter and desperately wants some normal female influence in her life to counter his aunt and uncle. He regards them as more than merely eccentric and believes there is bad blood tending, to madness, in the family. Indeed he fears it for himself and wants no more children.<BR>Sounds promising - a much used theme, but often effective. Not here unfortunately. <BR>Julia is simply an hysterical pain in the neck who needs to mature a good deal before either marrying, or being given charge of a child. She agrees unreservedly to a marriage of convenience without a physical relationship or love and immediately becomes angry when that it is not on offer. In addition, she is obsessed with her so-called 'mannish' appearance, height and awkwardness. <BR>Henry is only one notch better - he thinks he can control her by a display of passion to stop her mouth. Naturally she suddenly becomes all allure and woman to him.<BR>The tale then proceeds in a series of confrontations between the pair, especially over Julia's handling of the horses and the daughter. Each is sillier than the next. What is especially painful to read, is the escalating way in which Henry uses sex as a weapon in the fight and Julia tries to do the same. It begins to take a slightly sickening tinge.<BR>I do not like giving up on a book and not finishing it, but this turgid tale came near to being closed well before the last page.<BR>Not recommended in any way.	2004-05-31

Kingsley utilizes them to quite good effect. <BR>Charles Kirk still suffering the effects of wounds both mental and physical sustained from his service on the Peninsular is all set to start a new life as the custodian of one of his bother's estates, when he encounters the 'damsel in distress'- Serena Fairchild. She, as the daughter of and Earl has been shockingly kidnapped from a London park in the midst of a successful season as a reigning Incomparable, about which she was beginning to feel disillusioned.<BR>He immediately helps her to escape a pair of villains in the employ of a foppish rejected suitor and the two then embark upon a series of exhausting escapes across the English countryside to find a safe haven. The three villains shadow them with clever determination and are not wholely in tune. In fact the number one villain is well known to Charles from Portugal and it is a moot point who this horror is bent upon capturing - Charles or Serena. <BR>The books sets a cracking pace, while at the same time revealing the characters of Serena and Charles and developing their growing attraction to each other. We also learn of the reason behind Charles' pain regarding the war and he begins to recover to some degree (with Serena's help of course!)<BR>This was a good read, with several quibbles. Most notably the later plot development involving Charles allowing Serena to travel alone and thus be nabbed is most unconvincing.	2004-05-29

One evening, much to her disgust, he brings home a trio of friends to gamble. The next day Amy picks up a lottery ticket in the dishevilled room and decides to go along to the draw in a fit of curiosity. To her shock - the winning ticket is hers! Or rather she holds the winning ticket and has absolutely no idea who is its rightful owner. Wholly honest, she feels she must find the owner, very much over the horrified protests of her family who were delighted at the prospect of real money. She sets out to discover which gambler of the evening it could be.<BR>The rakish Earl of Tallant, Joss, was one of the aforementioned gamblers of that night and is in fact the true owner. She is both attracted to his person and repulsed by his character. He also finds himself attracted and very much interested against his inclinations (he is intent upon finding out what she will do with the ticket).<BR>The machinations of several shady characters and Tallant's own sister force the pair into an odd relationship wherein they both discover more than they bargained for.<BR>This is a completely charming tale, engaging hero and heroine. Neither are overly prone to theatrics and both in the end discover each other to be highly principled. The era was also believably created without modern mores irritatingly being slated home to the characters.<BR>A great read.	2004-05-29

In this instance it is it Miss Cicely Haringay who it the former and Mr Alex Evington the latter. Swirling in the background is a mystery associated with businessman Alex regarding the real reason he has purchased Cicely's home - Oakleigh Manor. <BR>These two of course start out with the usual set of angry prejudices about the respective classes to which each belongs. She hates him for buying her precious home, his ignorance of its traditions and feels a repugnance for a social climber. He dislikes her for being brought up in luxury and ease and shakes his head at traditions he has no real wish to understand.<BR>A much used plot that often works well. Here is does not - alas it is not even close to working. The two leads have some charm and are each likable. However the plot runs off the road in much the same way Cicely's bicycle does in the excruciating scene where the pair first meet. She is made to work for him, he is made to consult her about the manor. <BR>It ought to work - but does not. It is deadly dull and poor Cicely and Alex ought to run off together to a more interesting book.	2004-05-10

Dreadful I know, but I am almost helpless with curiosity when I see a fresh addition to this very long and seeminlgy endless list of the imaginings of others regarding our favourite characters and stories from Austen.<BR>'Pride and Prejudice' I suspect to be the most popular in this regard, and so when I saw this one and read its premise I was intrigued. A new slant on the whole matter! We have had Miss Austen as detective in Stephanie Barron's series and now Darcy and Elizabeth!<BR>Alas all my anticipation did not meet a happy eventuality. I found this made a good start with the opening scenes of the wedding and re-introducing the characters, but ... The whole thing upended itself with the arrival in London and Caroline Bingley's engagement to the mysterious American gentleman. It definitely became Gothic suspense and this is a genre that does not sit well with Austen, especially if one considers her gentle, sharp parodying of it in 'Northanger Abbey'. The resolution made my eyebrows shoot up with annoyance - the supernatural! All the good things in it were subsumed by this and it became silly. Very sad.	2004-05-04

She invades the hunting box of Richard the Marquess of Ardath, who she knows had been pursuing Clarissa. He indeed had been, with certain intentions that included marriage. Alas, for both parties, she is not there nor in fact anywhere to be found.<BR>The weeks until Christmas that ensue prove to be both eventful and eye-opening for Augusta the bluestocking and Richard the rake. Poor Augusta's bemused invasion by the children was well done, (deserted by both her cat and her personal maid!).<BR>Well of course the pair fall very easily in love with the children as well as each other. In fact Richard rather over does the fond 'father' and practically lives in the quartet's pockets. <BR>This was a charming story, with both hero and heroine nicely drawn (if a little lightly). The three children are not horribly good or bad, convincingly childish without being twee. My only complaint in this regard, was that both the adults were far to lenient with the little creatures, apparently being unable to resist melting looks and beseeching big eyes.<BR>This and also the very strange fact of just why Richard would want to marry a widow with three very young children kept the story from the five stars. Huntington gives the standard explantion of Richard thinking Clarissa as good a match as any and that he lusted after her - but the children really stretched this piece of conventionality.<BR>A light, charming, entertaining confection in keeping with the Christmas setting.	2004-04-20

Her unjust dismissal by her current employer, for the prejudiced reason that she is sister to a well-known campaigner for prison reform, has an unexpected result. His wife, to make up for the injustice, gives her a large sum of money. At the same time Lord Granville, knowing of the dismissal, offers her a new post with his own children with a generous wage. Flushed with her own independance, she rather rudely refuses his offer. All too soon she must eat her words and ask for the job, due to her profligate brother's theft of the money. She travels to his country estate and finds the children well provided for materially, but in need of their father's attention.<BR>Thus the stage is set for a romance between Granville and Lucy.<BR>A slightly melodramatic one, but an enjoyable one nonetheless. <BR>The attraction is strong and the situation is made more impossible by Granville's political ambitions and his mother's matchmaking and dreadful arrogance. <BR>There is a charming secondary romance involving Granville's invalid sister and her suitor who writes her very bad poetry.<BR>Another review comments on Kennedy's historical accuracy, unfortunately this is not true. She has many things right, but her politics are woefully wrong and as she has made Granville a Whig with prime ministerial ambitions, it intrudes into the story. The worst is that she is writing of Granville as if he had to worry about being re-elected to a seat in the Commons, when he is in fact an Earl and so had a seat in the Lords.<BR>That and other slips aside, the hero and heroine are well drawn and sympathetic. Granville maybe is better than Lucy, who is a bit too perfect and does not seem to change her views at all.<BR>The melodrama is cranked up to full heat with the plot development involving the dishonest brother and poor Lucy is put through the wringer.<BR>A good story, sympathetic characters - but marred.	2004-03-29

Too much holly, ivy, mistletoe, snow, snow fights, snow angels, sledding, etc. I began to feel like Scrooge and almost uttered an exasperated, 'humbug'. Perhaps here in the nearly 40 degree heat of an Australian Christmas I was not happy to read of snow and wrapping up in ultra-warm clothes.<BR>No, it was just too much of everything, including the overt messages of reconciliation and redeeming love. I would have enjoyed the stories individually, but together I was going into sugar shock.<BR>The best tale was the new one - 'A Family Christmas', a story of an arranged marriage between Edwin, the son of a 'Cit' and Elizabeth, the daughter of needy aristocracy. The hero and heroine were sympathetically drawn and each point of view presented realistically and individually. No obvious siding with the female point of view, or that of the 'worthy' son of the unpretentious. Not only was their realization of mutual love touchingly portrayed, but the growth of Elizabeth into herself was well done. She felt able and strong enough to make a stand for her life and self in opposing her overforceful mother.<BR>The next three all had charm, but were not nearly so good. <BR>'The Star of Bethlehem' - a story of a marriage going wrong, saved by the loss of a precious engagement ring and the appearance of a climbing boy.<BR>'The Best Gift' - the story of a teacher being drawn into the new relationship between a pupil and her uncle.<BR>'Playing House' - the renewal of an old romance between the father of a lonely, young girl and the orphaned eldest daughter of a family contemplating their parting at Christmas.<BR>However, the last,- No Room At the Inn, annoyed me profoundly. The teeth-grindingly allegorical nature of paralelling the birth of a child to a poor, unmarried couple forced to seek shelter in dreadful weather at an isolated inn, was more than too much. The smug vicar/doctor holding off his help regarding the imminent birth, to bring out the best in the other occupants of the inn, made me angry instead of touched. Child birth in this era was definitely not something to be taken lightly.<BR>Probably better to read these over a long period of time and not all at once.	2004-01-20

Then she realizes that there will doubtless be serious trouble with him, due to her guests - a travelling troupe of actors. They have been a source of comfort, friendship and occupation since the loss of her mother and step-father. Presuming the Earl would throw them out on their collective ears, she decided to conceal them as servants.<BR>Naturally confusion follows and the two are soon drawn to each other.<BR>I enjoyed the characters of Marcus and Julia. Marcus was an especially sympathetic hero, his situation and upbringing gradually being revealed and showing how his views of his father's remarriage had been formed. Now, all this is being changed - mostly due to Julia and his awakening feelings for her.<br />Julia definitely was charming - but just a bit too charming. A bit too perfect, except for her jealousy of Lady Angela the local belle. <BR>A particular scene involving a syllabub and the psuedo servants was meant to be hilarious and at the Lady's expense. Except, it would have been seen as cruel directed at the heroine. There seemed to simply be a nasty tinge to the presentation of the competition and her father. They were meant to be dreadful in every way - why? if Julia was so wonderful? Surelyshe did not need such an extreme contrast. It and other similar touches reduced the story to the slapstick level.<BR>The other problem, was the enormous black plot hole. How could Julia and Marcus be living together at Rosemount without scandal? Not a whisper of impropriety from anyone. The plot introduced 'scandal' only when cranked out at the correct moment in a very laboured piece of a manufactured cliched situation.<BR>A pleasant read - but there were problems that reduced it.	2004-01-10

None of which impressed her very romantic sister, Olivia, who strenuously objected at length. <BR>The sisters travel to London for pleasure and purchase a wardrobe for Elise, while staying with their aunt, Ravinia Longfellow. Whilst there, Elise soon decides she does not want a marriage of convenience and common sense after all. She meets a very charming, flirtatious young man, James Gray, and writes to break the engagement. However, all is not well for this affair of the heart. Confusion reigns when her sister appears to be similarly smitten. <BR>The mix is highly flavoured by Aunt Ravinia's family, all in the house for the Christmas holidays, and the said aunt's managing proclivities. They are particularly evident in relation to the son of a friend, Walter Belvedere, devoted to scholarship and very unsociable.<BR>Walter and Elise become involved in a false betrothal and here the plot runs off the rails. This was really quite unnecessary and never at all convincing - even to the other characters.<BR>The best part of the story was the family interactions - although the author seems to have changed her mind mid-way about which set of siblings are to be the disruptives.<BR>As a result it is more a family tale than a romance. Sibling squabbles and childish pranks abound with two sets of children involved.<BR>Elise had good points, but she suddenly turned into a frothy, fool with the arrival in London and never really recovered. Walter was far more interesting and I pitied him sincerely in the toils of Aunt Ravinia (teeth grittingly bossy of her whole family). His explanations of his understandable attitudes to so-called manners in social situations are priceless. Elise enjoys her offence at them and labels them rude, principally as they ignore her own right to attention.<BR>Enjoyable, better than the Icy predecessor. A slight charmer, with faults.	2004-01-06

He finds her to be a foolish chit of a girl. Naturally they are meant, by the author, for each other - but only after Ivy runs through an infatuation with Edward one of the brothers (a very slippery charmer indeed).<BR>This all sounds very promising - but never really engages, mostly due to the fact that Ivy is surely one of the most irritating young girls I have read in a Regency for some time. She jumps on every word Westbrook utters, takes offence and rips back at him petulently at every turn. He is so much a man of sense, that one cannot understand why he proceeds to abandon his all too correct opinion of her and fall in love with the silly widgeon. After this change of heart, he tells her several times he thinks her intelligent and unusual etc. - and one cannot understand it, as she never exhibits any of those characteristics.<BR>There were saving graces, I particularly liked the scene where 'Romeo and Juliet' is played for the servants and they add their very proper early 19th Century views of propriety to their comments on the play.

She is also not an<BR>author to be lightly taken up at will, for a pleasant few minutes. Her writing requires concentration and time. <BR>Here she is starting on a new series featuring Lucrezia <BR>Borgia and it is an engrossing opener. We are launched <BR>directly into both the poisoning murder of one of her <BR>ladies in waiting and her confusing, tentative relationship<BR>with her husband Alfonso.<BR>She realizes immediately that she must solve this murder,to<BR>clear her name and be able to continue this new life that <BR>she has found so much more pleasant than her former fraught<BR>life in Rome.<BR>There is a good deal of period detail that convincingly establishes the background, without becoming a history lecture.  <BR>The tortuous life of the Ferrara court is revealed through <BR>the relationships between the characters. They all obviously have a life of their own, independant of the main plot.<br />Occasionally the dialogue is too wordy, the conversations sag to a too-distant point, but this does not distract permanently<BR>from the story.<BR>The relationship between the politically married couple, however, is far more fascinating and often I wanted the mystery to disappear, so that more would be revealed about Alfonso.<BR>He is far more of an engrossing mystery to both the reader <BR>and Lucrezia. The final paragraph scene between husband and wife is a dreadful teaser.<BR>I shall definitely be reading the next installment - for just this reason.	2003-12-24

The premise initially worried me - the self-righteous American berating the allegedly dissolute, useless aristocrat. However, the heroine, Constance Locke, may have indeed expressed herself in this way at first, but she redeemed herself soon after. She realised that there could be other opinions than her own. Lord Yates was very much the likable, seemingly foolish unheroic nobleman. He is caught at the beginning of this tale, at the crossroads, for him, of deeper thoughts on life. He is discovering the aimlessness of his existance and finding his usual pleasures empty. The influence of the family tomb on his state of mind, is particularly well done and is a recurrent motif.<BR>Both of these characters are well drawn and likable from the first. They are both willing and ready to change and not stupidly stubborn in their behaviour.<BR>Read and enjoy.	2003-12-22

Julius, Lord Claredon and Victoria Mallory are too much the caricatures, the cardboard cutouts, to be anything much more than irritating. He is more interesting than her by a whisker. Her petulance is just too much. A nice juicy murder with her as victim? There is a good deal of charm in the author's writing, and her stories are often entertaining. Alas not here.	2003-12-15

Something went wrong and gradually we begin to realize that there is more to the sad tale than meets the eye, rather it relates to what can only just be seen out of the corner of our eyes. There are dark doings related to both Jovian and a mysterious Sir Erebus Lethe. Anthea's new step-sister Corinna fresh from Ireland is also a large, innocent part in a sinister web of evil-tinged magic.<BR>The tale jumps and starts quite a bit and eventually jolts into the country very unconvincingly for more dastardly deeds of a supernatural nature.<BR>I enjoyed the tale, it has far more of the Persphone spring myth than romance between Anthea and Jovian. The only real fault, was that too much time was spent in complicated explanations of just how and why this Greek myth tranported itself over time into the English countryside.<BR>Heath's supernatural tales are always an interesting read, and sometimes the mix just does not work. This one, however, did to good effect	2003-12-09

Fortunately her 'service' is not to her and her cardboard daughters, but the aunt's brother Addison Banks, a typical absent-minded scientific gentleman with a balloon.<BR>Her prince is Gabriel Crowe, sent down into the depths of the country to find a bride on the express orders of his irate father. Here, his mother madly (and rather unbelievably) informs the whole county of this intention, so that every mother and daughter are in hot pursuit.<BR>Naturally the pair meet through circumstance and Ella is mistaken for a servant by her dreadful appearance. <BR>There is much fun had from her small feet in quest of a pair of shoes that actually fit. <BR>The ball becomes a garden party and Ella never actually is the cynosure of all eyes in dancing with her 'prince'. They merely sigh in a secluded corner of the garden.<BR>The evil aunt, the unfeeling mother, the eccentric uncle, the feckless brother of Gabriel etc. all combine in a climax where hero and heroine accidentally fly off in a runaway balloon.<BR>This was a pleasant, charming, very light tale. Ella and Gabriel are well done, but their supporting cast are mostly far too lightly sketched in, as are some of the situations that move the story forward. The mother, aunt and daughters are especially weak. The secondary thread involving Gabriel's brother's romance is unbelievable and irritating. The finale - the timely inheritance to make all right - is also just too pat. <BR>Definitely not memorable. However, this was an entertaining read for an idle few hours.	2003-11-29

Having read several others of Tennant's continuations, I ought to have known better. For once again the author has decided to refocus a well-known book to make it read as she thinks it ought to be seen. <BR>The book is mainly told from Adele's point of view, changing as she ages in tone to reflect her new, less childish perspectives. Then there are also several changes to the narrative of other characters: Rochester, Mrs. Fairfax and Grace Poole (of all people!). These made an already wobbly narrative thread, a jolting one. It was Wuthering Heights and not Jane Eyre that was written in this fashion.<BR>I also could not help but be confused by several background references made in the text to such things as railway fortunes, Parisian boulevardes and Puccini operas. Were these meant to show the narrative was actually coming from the distance of many years? For none of these things were appropriate to the period setting. Odd and irritating.<BR>Then the storyline itself seemed to be trying to out trump Bronte in the melodrama stakes. The whole of the drawn out conclusion with Adele's flight to Paris was too much. Tennant truly did evoke some beautiful, almost lyrical images - but it ill fitted the overall tone of dark melodrama. The whole mystery of Adele's birth being given an extra notch of dark deeds, was far too unbelievable.<BR>I felt slightly insulted and definitely thankful that I had read it courtesy of my local library.	2003-08-19

She, in the usual tradition of 'strong-willed' heroines, refuses him. Neither the proposal or a further meeting would have occurred but for their connection through Rebecca's grandfather. In London, at the reading of his will, the pair shockingly discover they are joint owners of his cotton mill. Naturally they are soon spitting at each other. Mysterious accidents follow, culminating in an attempt to burn down the mill and her rescuing him. A promising mystery, attraction between the protagonists ... everything is there - but chemistry and interest. For some reason the tale falls flat. Rebecca is presented as independant, intelligent etc. etc. - but demonstrates none of these attributes. She places herself in foolish situations and then hands over decisions to the suddenly wonderful Joshua without much struggle at all. She becomes dull. There is of course a villain - but he is so flat as to be thinner than cardboard. Very disappointing.	2003-07-29

So, straight to my opinion - I liked the story, I enjoyed my read ... but ... Yes, there is a good deal that drags an interesting tale into bouts of boredom. We are privy too far too much of Miles's thoughts, it is good to know the hero's mind - but after a few pargraphs one felt a trifle overloaded. It began to slow down the action drastically and repeat itself. <BR>The subplots involving the various members of Miles's family were very perfunctory and regarding his siblings, definitely bore the dire air of being possible sequels. The blackmail subplot involving his mother stuck out like a sore thumb. All that lead up with the mother's odd character and behaviour with Annabelle, and the revelation seemed very much an anti-climax for all its drama. Perhaps because the mother was an unconvincing mish-mash? She had absolutely no character - but maybe this was the author's intention. The subplot involving Annabelle's father was far better done and definitely a surprise. This was handled well, Annabelle's reaction of dismay and disillusion was particularly believable.<BR>Both Miles and Annabelle were well drawn charcters, even if they droned on to themselves in a wallowing manner. The illness, the recovery and Annabelle's change due to the whole experience were the backbone of the book. Again, well done. So the irritations stood out more.	2003-07-17

This I think is definitely her best novel. There was little I could fault in it - and if I did, it felt like nit-picking.<BR>Selwood Priory is inherited by Rev. Veryan Selwood from his extremely dissolute old relative, Sir Walter (an old-fashioned, drinking, gambling, wenching English squire type straight out of Tom Jones). However, the old lech also left a daughter Dorothy, as well as his discarded mistress(who was Dorothy's governess many years ago) and his two illegitimate children by her. Apparently he spread his favours far and wide, leaving a bevy of futher illegitimate children, who crop up throughout the novel in various stations in life.<BR>The Priory is not exactly a well run estate and a large part of Sir Walter's income is derived from extremely profitable smuggling operations. Dorothy has a serious stake in this, as the funds for the ship involved was filched by her dear father from her dowry.<BR>So the stage is set - Veryan is very much the quiet, bookish, terribly innocent man of learning; Dorothy is prepared to resent him for disrupting their lives and particularly is concerned for her ex-governess and half siblings.<BR>These two are poles apart - so they each grow and discover each other in the course of the story. Veryan learns not to be so rigid, Dorothy learns there is far more to him and that, in the end, he has the intelligence to properly run the estate once he finds his way.	2003-06-11

If it had any faults, I definitely forgot them under the spell of its charm. <BR>The 'forced' engagement undertaken by the couple with the intention of later breaking it, is almost a hoary old cliche in this genre. Sometimes it works and mostly it is just a yawn - one has read it all too often. Here, however, there was no such impulse or faint praise. <BR>The characters were all sympathetic and believable - from the protagonists Gil and Chloe, to the important secondaries of Gil's sister, brother-in-law and Lord Rival. <BR>Chloe actually matures in a believable way, she is made to see the error of her youthful attempts to make everything right as being foolish. She discovers how little she truly knows about those she loves the most and suffers as the result of grave misjudgments of her sister's marriage and relations with the rakish Rival. <BR>However, the most interesting lesson she is taught, is at Gil's hands. His angry confrontation with her, that makes her realize the depths of her selfish lack of consideration for him and his opinions is very well done indeed. All too often the heroine in a romance does such things and escapes censure at the hero's hands, while the hero is always rightly brought to book. <BR>Rival of course is the too-attractive semi-villain many love to sigh over. He very successfully almost overshadows Gil - but his undoubted paucity of active virtues put him into the category of the undeserving. Thankfully Gil was not 'too good to be true', no he was definitely very human and his realization of love was well drawn.<BR>Of course the 'in' joke of the Heyer references made the reading all the more enjoyable.	2003-05-29

Indeed, the pivot of most of her stories is usually a particularly hard fact of life - and often death as well (something not often emphasized in a romance novel per se).<BR>Both hero and heroine are well drawn and the reader is soon definitely sympathetic to the feelings of each. The truth of war and its true cost are definitely underlying this tale. <br />Jesse's love for Elinore is obvious from the start, and throughout we are actually more shown his deep feelings and point of view, than hers. His strength of character is obvious, but his realization of it himself is a large part of the enjoyment of the story. Elinore's feelings are not so easily discerned by the reader, perhaps because she is resolutely not wanting to know them herself due to her hard life.<BR>I was only prevented from giving it a top mark, by two things. First, the very melodramatic resolution of their return to the British Army. It just seemed a stroke too much. Second, the short conclusion of the story in a summation of Jesse and Elinore's married life in England. I wanted to be shown some of their happiness - to contrast with the wrenching suffering & the vale of tears through which they had passed.<BR>Well written and an undeniably engrossing story.	2003-05-26

I definitely liked many aspects of it, but a good deal of it also spoiled my feeling anything more than a mild liking (at best) for it. I think it was spoiled for me from the point, very early on, where Amelia mistook Andreas for a Catholic priest. I just could not think any girl could be that ignorant. Well perhaps it just shows how ignorant the English were about Catholics - but it seemed slightly unbelievable that she believed him to be a priest simply because he wore black. So her continued belief during this initial portion of their relationship, made her even appear even sillier. She just seemed to enjoy feeling superior to him as regards money as well and thus her character seemed shallow.	2003-05-20

Rachel was a rather tantalising character from the first book involving her brother. She had been definitely set as unsympathetic and almost hissable. Her treatment of the Colin Varens, who has been dreadfully in love with her for years, was a definite black mark. Now here, she is redeemed by herself and discovers there is more to life than she had previously thought. A good marriage had been her goal in life, and now she discovers that her idea of this being solely a matter of economics, convenience and social status are not enough. A desire for love breaks through her iced-in self.<BR>There are of course secondary plots involved - involving first her stuffy betrothed and then also Colin's sister Andromeda.<BR>These two involved good ideas, but I felt them to have been sped through in their resolution. This feeling of the book needing more depth was also echoed in Rachel's own story. We are shown how Rachel changes, and it is understandable - but it seemed too quick, too rushed. She suddenly seems to turn over her new leaf and it is far too sudden and as as result not as convincing. <BR>This was a good story, but it could have been so much better and I know Simpson can do this better.	2003-05-20
