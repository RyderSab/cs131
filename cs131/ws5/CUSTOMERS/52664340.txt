Davis has written the only full-length biography of John C. Breckinridge, who is one of the most fascinating and yet one of the least well known figures in all of American history.<br />Davis begins by charting Breckinridge's early years as a lawyer, his rise in Kentucky state politics and then national politics, his role as Vice-President and his reluctant campaign for the Presidency in 1860. Davis then provides an excellent overview of Breckinridge's career as a Confederate military leader, fighting on nearly every front of the war and ending the war as the Confederate Secretary of State. Davis also gives an outstanding account of Breckinridge's dramatic escape from the country following the Confederate defeat, which was an adventure so extraoridinary that it should be made into a movie. Davis concludes his work by describing Breckinridge's years as an exile before his final return to Kentucky and his tragic early death.<br />Davis is one of the country's best historians of the Civil War, and this book is an excellent manifestation of his scholarly and literary gifts. Not only is it full of information, allowing the reader to truly feel as though they have a solid understanding of Breckinridge's life, but it is written in such a fine style that it is always entertaining and never dull.	2002-07-09

It is an extremely well-written and well-researched history of Scotland following the unification with England in 1707, built around the contributions Scots have made to the modern world. Filled with historical detail, it still manages to be easily readable and there is scarcely a dull paragraph in the entire work.<br />The author provides a window through which the reader can peer into the fascinating world of mid-18th Century Scotland and the people who inhabited it. Adam Smith, David Hume, Lord Kames, James Watt and other crucial figures to Western history walk through these pages. Not only is this work informative, but it is wonderfully entertaining- exactly what popular history should be.<br />This book fills what had been a missing gap in popular history. I urge you to read it.	2002-07-08

The style is excellent and one easily gets a feel for both Captain Cook as a person and the world in which he lived.<br />However, it should be pointed out that Dugard is not a professional historian, so readers seeking a highly-detailed source of information on Cook may be disappointed. Indeed, the book doesn't even have an index.<br />That said, this book is very good and won't disappoint you.	2002-07-01

The author does a fine job, with a large amount of detail being presented in a readable style. One comes away feeling they have gained a solid understanding of the campaign.<br />The book could have made better it the author had carefully examined the mindset of Napoleon himself, and how he felt about everything he was doing. The book also ended rather abruptly, without a discussion of the long-term effects of Napoleon's campaign.<br />Despite those flaws, this book was very good and should be read by anyone attempting to understand the Napoleonic period.	2002-06-26

He seems much more concerned with grinding his own political axe than in presenting an accurate view of history. Other historians have dismissed his work as being closer to fiction than reality.<br />A better study on the period of 1813-1814 is R.F.

In addition to providing a fairly thorough outline of the events of Voltaire's life (it would require a massive, multivolume work for a complete picture of the man), this book also properly puts Voltaire in the context of the 18th Century Enlightenment, of which he was the brightest light. <BR>While highly-researched and scholarly, it is also very readable and does not descend into the pedantic writing style so many academics are guilty of. Both the professional scholar and the interested layperson would find this work valuable.	2001-11-16

Dr. Dunn has done an excellent job: his writing style flows nicely and his research is first-rate. In addition to being highly informative, this book is simply good to read.<br />This book would be useful to anyone who seeks to understand the relationship between the Soviet Union and the United States during the 1930s and 40s. It also helps illustrate how the Soviet Union worked and gives interesting insight into the personality of Stalin himself.<br />People who are particularly fond of Franklin Roosevelt might not like some of Dr. Dunn's conclusions, however. Be warned.	2001-09-19

Simply put, it is a massive organizational study of Napoleon's armed forces, from an infantryman deep in Russia to the military police on the streets of Paris. The amount of detail contained within this volume staggers the mind, and yet Elting is such an effective writer that the book is never slow. In fact, the author's witty and sometimes sarcastic writing style makes it a delightful read.<br />Elting assumes the reader has some general knowledge of the Napoleonic period, so if you're not well-versed in the history of that time you will encounter names of people and battles that are unfamiliar to you.<br />Elting is also clearly fond of Napoleon as a soldier and a man, so all you Napoleon-haters out there would be well advised to avoid this book (you might learn things which challenge your viewpoint).<br />All in all, I thought this book was a wonderful work of history and I thoroughly enjoyed reading it.	2001-09-03

Brands has written a biography that is both immensely informative and wonderfully entertaining. He presents great amounts of detail but never allows the reader to become bogged down in it, and his fluid prose makes the book easily readable. Whether you know something about Franklin or nothing at all, this book will give you a solid understanding of the man's life and work. Franklin is history's greatest example of a well-lived life, and his story should be an inspiration to everyone. I strongly urge you to read this book: you will both learn something and be uplifted.	2001-09-03

It is almost certainly the best account available of the events of 1813-1814. Military and political events are properly balanced, with neither receiving too much or too little attention. The author is also able to draw about the characters themselves, especially Napoleon himself. Marshal Ney and Marshal Marmont receive their fair share, and the only real complaint I would have is that the author needlessly repeats the fact that Marshal MacDonald was the son of a Scottish clansman about a dozen times.	2001-07-15

If I hadn't checked the copyright date when I bought it, I might have thought this worek had been published only recently. The detailed information the author provides is fascinating and is presented in such a way that it avoids clouding the writing or boring the reader. One gets a feel not only for what Franklin did, but for what sort of man he was. The author is sympathetic to the object of his study, but not to the point where it becomes distracting. All in all, a wonderful read which contains an immense amount of fascinating information.	2001-06-08

The author laid out his thesis quite openly and made a convincing argument for it, although he was never dogmatic about it. One complaint- the early Italian campaigns are covered in exhaustive detail, while all the post-Marengo campaigns are treated with comparative brevity. I think the author should have written a more balanced treatment. For example, the 1814 campaign in France is dealt with in a few paragraphs when, in my view, it should have had a complete chapter devoted to it. Nevertheless, I thought this book was good and the information contained in it was quite enlightening.	2001-06-08

But he's not a short-term thinker; much of the book deals with his ideas of Mars colonization and the eventual terraformation of the planet. Although much of it may be overly optimistic, there are no proposals which seem impossible; everything Zubrin discusses in this could, in theory, be done. Some of the best writing within the book deals not with the technical aspects of sending a mission to Mars, but Zubrin's heartfelt reasons for WHY such a mission should be sent in the first place. I recommend this book to anyone.	2001-05-19

The way the author begins each chapter with a tiny fictionalized section is a nice touch. And the chapter dealing with how the exploitation of space resources can be used to help solve some of Earth's environmental problems is very good.<br />There are a few complaints. The author is an expert on asteroids, and spends the bulk of the book discussing them at the expense of the Moon, Mars and the outer planets. Mercury, a potential source of energy due to its proximity to the Sun, is not even mentioned. And terraforming is likewise ignored.<br />Still, a good book which I would recommend to anyone interested in space colonization.	2001-05-19
US	52664340	RJA7FMX2Z9RCO	0399145761	539869630	What if...?	Books	4	1	1	N	N	Pretty good, but some absurdity thrown in	I liked this book quite a bit and would recommend it. The chapter dealing with the Mongol invasion of Europe in the 13th Century was simply outstanding, and the chapter on the American Revolution was quite thought-provoking. But I thought the Civil War section was unimaginative; in speculating as to what might have happened if Lee's orders hadn't been lost in September, 1862, the author describes a battle taking place at (surprise, surprise) Gettysburg. The chapter dealing with the Aztec defeat of Cortez had great promise but a good deal of nonsense; how on Earth could the Aztecs have built a navy? Also, the sections on World War One and World War Two could have been much better. Still, for all its faults, I thought this book was an entertaining read.	2001-05-18

Books	1	74	121	N	N	Ridiculous and absurd	The now-infamous Kennedy brothers produced a work that no self-respecting historian, whether they be Northerners or Southerners, would ever take seriously. They have no idea how to do historical research, their arguments are full to the brim with meaningless statements, their sources are flimsy to say the least, their references lack any authority whatsoever, and their approach is so dripping with partisanship and anger that I find it difficult to believe how any reasonably intelligent and objective person can take this stuff seriously. As a Southerner whose ancestors fought in the Civil War as members of the 35th North Carolina Infantry, I believe in honoring Southern history. What I object to is twisting Southern history into a falsehood designed merely to promote one's personal political and racial views.	2000-12-02

As a person who has read just about every book concerning the Atlanta Campaign that I can get my hands on, I can say without hesitation that this  is the best of the lot. Indeed, of all the books on the history of the  Civil War, this is my favorite. The research is exhaustive and the detail  incredible. Castel sees the war through the eyes of the highest ranking  generals and the lowest privates. Quite balanced, with none of the regional  basis so often encountered in Civil War history. Brilliant.	2000-08-17

In this book, he takes us beyond Mars to  the other worlds in our solar system, beyond them to the other stars of our  galaxy, and, as an added bonus, threw in some insightful thoughts  concerning the possibility of extraterristrial intelligence. For those  people who haven't read &quot;The Case for Mars,&quot; Zubrin includes a  chapter summarizing it. I would strongly urge you, however, to read  &quot;The Case for Mars&quot; as soon as you can possibly get your hands on  it. Most of the ideas of this book will come to pass, if they do at all,  long after anyone alive today has long since gone. Therefore, it lacks some  of the uplifting delight of &quot;The Case for Mars.&quot; Nevertheless,  this book is fascinating and should be on everyone's book shelf.	2000-04-09

Although his contributions were perhaps as great as those of Jefferson, Franklin, and Washington, we have not even gone to the trouble of erecting a statue of  him in Washington D.C. Fruchtman's biography gives a wonderful portrait of  this complicated man. Most studies of Paine tend to be overly apologetic or  overly critical; Fruchtman succeeds in giving him balanced treatment. He is  frank about Paine's successes and Paine's failures. This biography should  be considered the definitive work on Thomas Paine. Anyone who loves freedom  should study the life of this remarkable American. Fruchtman's biography is  a good place to start.	1999-10-14

I am fed up with McDowell treating Christians as if they were stupid children. This is the final book of his I shall ever read. The \\"moral truths\\" which McDowell presents are either one of two things. First, some of them are so incredibly obvious that no person seriously doubts them, and any fool could have figured them out for himself. Or second, they are outdated and anachronistic relics of a past that is best left behind. Reading this book made me think that McDowell belongs somewhere in the mid-1800s rather than on the verge of the 21st Century. Clearly, if his point of view is followed, Christianity will be pulled backward, rather than moved forward.	1999-03-26
