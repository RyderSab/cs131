It amazes me how everyone seems to think they can write a story.  This one proves they can't.  I tried to read it as it unfolded but just couldn't.  I finally skimmed thru it to the end.  What a waste of paper, ink and time. <br />Don't pick up this book.	2005-07-19

This was the most dragged out, disgusting book I have ever picked up.  I have found I can skim books I don't like and still get enough out of the senseless story to rate it.   Jamie needed to be hit over the head a few times to discover Dillon's true worth, but then I guess he wanted her to believe the worst. <br /> <br />This book left a bad taste in my mouth.   I need to find something that will rid me of it, maybe a John Grisham.	2005-07-19

For instance how is everyone in the little unheard of community of Ravenkill right up with the happenings in The Hague?  Does world wide news reach little burgs that fast.  And what was with Andrew Franconia the innkeeper that he calls the US Marshalls as soon as Maggie registers?   I don't get it, everyone seems to know what everyone else is doing faster than they can move about.   So I guess I'll have to finish the story to find all the answers if they are revealed.	2005-06-24

I thought I was reading Danielle Steele, who I have given up on because of her repetitious driving of her point across.  So they are living with a lot of angst, get on with it.   Should she try to save Beth, cause she couldn't save Glenda? Will Nick turn out to be another guy to do her wrong even if she feels such a strong attraction to him?  Can he ever forgive himself for not making Alyssa wear her helmet.  Stay tuned for the next chapter in this soap saga.  No one wants to tell anyone anything but they are all sure trying to find out everyone's secrets.   That's a small town for you, you can never outrun your past.	2005-06-20

I liked Marie and she was more correct in her opinions than her professor. <br />The only thing I can say for sure was that John flew, and 2 people wrote books on what they felt they knew about him. <br />As for being a good portrayal of modern Indian Culture, I don't believe it is.  As for the casinos on Indian Land, don't go there hoping to see Indians cause what you will find are the same addicted gamblers you would find anywhere. <br />Not sure if I would recommend this book or not,  but it does make you think, if you can hang in there and get through all the details.	2005-06-19

Since there have been countless books in between I can't remember that one \\"Come the Spring\\".   I enjoyed this book more than any I have read for a long time.

He ex-husband really did a number on her and she started investigating things when it was almost too late.

I see the majority feel the same.  There isn't anything new in this book, just a retelling of all the characters pasts and their connections to each other.  Someone said the characters had changed so much they were unrecognizable.   I don't agree, expecially Marino, if anything is has become more gross, in looks and behavior.  Who'd put up with a boorish slob like that anyway.  I really don't think I need to finish this disgusting, rambling story as the ending sounds to be anti-climatic. <br />Come on Ms Cornwell you are capable of better than this.	2005-04-27

I didn't even know Janet Leigh wrote novels, but boy can she.  Almost everything in this wonderful story of a loving family turns out the way you would like it to. <br />I had my doubts when I read the synopsis, I thought I don't know-a story about tinsel town?  But it rivited me to it.  My only disappointment is that it didn't cover more of Penelope and Jude's life together and gave minute detail to all the years before, but it was worth hanging in there.   Find a copy and read this for sure. <br />	2005-03-20

I find it so sloppy I have even laughed in a couple places.  First how does one on their deathbed desire and perform great sex?  Next how does everyone Max runs into know all about this super secret group, so secret if one's \\"cover\\" is blown he has to be eliminated by one of the other  \\"secret' agents?  <br />Is there not multiple ways to protect glass windows from being broken and enabling thrown rocks to hit just what they should? Have you ever heard of grating covering the glass?  The sun for the sick scientist can still enter.    Have you ever tried to hold insects from flying through broken windows with your blouse and just your 2 arms- not likely.   I could go on and on but you get the idea.   And what do they plan to do with the missing canister?   hmmmm   let me think.  There's a line of spray trucks ready to spray the entire town - doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure that out and I haven't finished the book yet. <br />Save you money or if you want to dispute this review, borrow the book.	2005-03-16

I have to agree with some of the other reviews that the character of Paris was not very well developed. What an empty life she had sentanced herself to.   How much quilt does one have to repay?   Not only was this DJ allowed to sit in on and contribute to investigative discussions so was the 17 year old Gavin.  My what twisted lives those teens lived, imagine them all becoming adults.   Watch out world another bunch of twisted offspring.  It was indeed suspenseful and kept you guessing on which of the 4 perverts was actually Valentino.  They were all guilty of something, some more than others.  What a shame those wealthy pampered teens didn't have some good clubs to spend their energies on. <br />Sandra Brown still rates as one of my many read authors.	2005-02-23

Namely the ability of Sir Peter to reach his home by phone after it had been explained the phone lines had been cut outside the home requiring Tom to run to the neighbors to call emergency. <br />All in all I think the author did a bang up job for a first novel	2005-02-17

How the others had to be quick to keep up with Amanda's inventive stories.   Sir Gareth was a jewel.  I think this was the first book by Heyer I've read, but I will look for more.

Clumsy Claire just kept falling into trouble so Hero Nick could race to the rescue.  And what a lame ending!. Why did it take a year after all the tragic events to get around to taking down the bridge?  And our star crossed lovers still weren't married?  I wonder if anyone has tested silk ties to see how much weight they will support tossed over a rough steel girder of a bridge?   This story started out pretty good, mystery and an attraction between two people, but it fell apart somewhere 1/2 way through.  I was just skimming through the pages at the end untill it was somewhat tied up and explained.  The author tried a little too hard to weave every thing in to one story and it was not very cohesive.  Even absent dad rallied at the end in spite of his constant dialysis treatments.   <br />Sorry Ms Harper try again <br />	2005-01-25

It is hard to visualize FBI or Secret Service agents behaving like these have so far.  When did men need anything more than their underwear to sleep in? to need to wear a woman's nightgown?   Give me a break!.  And what's with the dog running the show?   One can be a canine enthusiast without having them running the house where ever and when ever they go.

The struggle the characters had to realize their dreams was gut-wrenching, any weaker person would have broken.  Some of the reviewers couldn't understand why Rio was like he was, but I think the reasons for his inner workings was clearly explained. Like one of the other characters he befriended said Rio's life would have broke a weaker man.   He not only had stronger beliefs than anyone ever, but he was a friend to so many in their time of need.   The story couldn't have unfolded any other way in order for Hope to learn the far reaches of the kindness and unselfishness of the man Rio was.    <br />Yes there should have been a sequel to show us more of what went into realizing the fruit of the dream of Hope for the Valley of the Sun.	2005-01-11

Not knowing anything about the Asian culture I found this story to be just terrible.   The brutality and utter disregard about the welfare of people, women especially was a total downer.  I felt nothing but revulsion reading this story.  No characters to admire at all and no integrity to each other.  Anyone could be bought and everyone betrayed everyone else.

I am referring to lost lover Morrell.  If V.I. makes a profit in her crazy investigative career it's a miracle.  Massage's and motels for a few hours rest, 3 traffic tickets for overparking because she couldn't get back to her car in time, just a few examples.

Well this doesn't appear to be a very popular book, or else readers weren't interested enough to write a review.   I would have to agree more closely with reviewer #2.  The book was very slow and skipped around so many characters it was difficult to keep them straight.  It's a wonder, Gerald,Paul/Frank could keep his story straight he told so many lies.  He must have had some talent tho' to be hired by 2 different Universities and didn't seem to lack money, dressed nicely, drove a BMW, etc.  The story does make one stop and think tho' about the effort a twisted mind goes to to pull off the subterfuge he did.	2004-09-16

It is hard to categorize this story, what was it meant to be?  Totally unbelievable mystery? ghost story? love story? Fairy tale about goblins and bad men wanting to do away with children?  Take your pick, it is a bit of all the above <br />I buy very few books for this very reason.  At least I don't feel bad that I actually put out money for garbage.

If they couldn't afford all three, they should have adopted all three out to a family that could raise and love them without separating them. <br /> <br />And to be able to pull off a triple wedding in one week, we all know that's not possible with full custom made gowns.

I can understand how the &quot;cowboy&quot; got and kept his alluring shape, but how did the novelist in the 2nd story do it? Occasionally chopping down a tree? I found it difficult to remember Gwen's mom was stated as being 47. Her mannerisms and expressions and behavior spoke of someone at least 20 years or more older. Do 47 year old women go around calling 35 year old male boarders darling? And everyone was dear with a pat on the hand. I have a 47 year old daughter and she certainly doesn't act like that, nor do I. Yes what was the reason to republish these 2 old novels in a new book?	2004-08-05

Most of her books I've enjoyed but this one was over the top.  Hard to find someone in this to really like, maybe Teddy showing a maturity beyond his years.  Although John has had time to get over his wife's betrayal and death, learning she was going to leave him anyway, he has his head so inside himself he can't see his kids.  Teddy does the best he can for his sister just 3 years younger, but she shows no maturity at all, not enough to even take baths.  I agree with others that the ending was just too much and to have it all crammed into the last 3 or 4 pages it was mind boggling.  Too bad John didn't wake up and become aware of his surroundings sooner.  The story was very slow moving and in all those pages no new territory was covered at all, just more of the same.  The only thing that would have topped the ending would have been to have Merrill break out of his high security death row cell.    You tell me how John and Katy can find any peace in their minds and hearts to have a life together, is beyond me.   They are too damaged and traumatized.	2004-08-02

Is this a British thing calling all females cows?  A more disreputable character I would hate to meet.  I can't find one good thing to say about this author.  The story was way too long and left a lot of holes not filled in.  Course who would have suspected 2 women, but after rounding up everyone Frost could he was bound to stumble on the actual perps.

I guess there were no talking animals in it.  Guess not too much effort was put into solving the mystery at the time of Nola's disappearance cause everyone thought the 2 eloped.

One thing for sure no one lacks for money in Ms. Steel's stories, jetting everywhere, staying in 4 Star hotels, calling for cars to take them everywhere.  It's a world I can't comprehend. Most people would have been bankrupt after a 2 month hospital stay and 9 months in a top notch rehab.  Also a small detail but how does Bill hop into the shower from his wheelchair?  None of the hotels I've stayed in have a shower you can roll into and I'm sure Isabella did not reserve a room for physically challenged.<BR>I was VERY disappointed in the end when Gordon did not get his come uppance.

I just think she has the greatest way with words and the things her characters say without saying anything, by just a scowl, or smothered smile are so eloquent.  I don't know if she means to continue with Charlotte and Thomas or Mr Monk now that she is starting a new series, but I will miss them for sure.  This was a great story and even with the obvious it's not the whole story.  Sometimes I wonder who really solves these crimes Thomas or Charlotte.    Don't mis this new chapter in their lives.	2004-07-02

I have to congratulate the rest of the reviewers that have ploughed their way through this entire series. I read one before this \\"Defiant Hero\\" and that's enough for me, thank you.  It is hard to believe a writer could drag out a story that takes place in 1 week folks, check the dates, but the way she did this was to sandwich in all the childhood trauma of Roger/Sam and the letter writing between Dot and Walt. She not only filled us in on all the background but kept beating us over the head with it.  And talk about sexual hangups these characters had them all.  At least any more in this series will have a change of pace you can hope since there are some career changes taking place, and maybe everyone will get lucky and Max will go off to Kenya and do some real adjusting.	2004-06-27

After reading the part about Alyssa's 2 sisters pregnancies, I realized this sounded familiar and checked my list of books read. I checked this one out from the library, didn't go looking for it on purpose.  This story is just too much to swallow.  Why does an author try to cover EVERY subject in the world with one story?  Terrorist, AKA 9/11, spousal and child abuse, porn, inter-racial marriages, red neck stereo type casting, FBI paranoia,etc? Better to pick one theme and stick to it.  I hope our countries security and safety is not hinged on these sex obessed people as described in this plot.    Help.  Did we really swallow the accident Gina had with Max just happening to be there to the rescue?  And that the drivers mimiced her cousin that was her father's 4 youngest brother's 3rd youngest son.   Give me a break. My last foray into the world as seen by Ms. Brockmann.	2004-06-26

It was all I could do to finish. During the reading of this fairy tale I can't help but wonder why the author doesn't follow her own theme.  First Becca is on her own, no one believes her, then she is totally believed and surrounded by agents watching her every move. They all wear kevlar vests to storm an empty house, except for the corpse of course.  Then when they figure the badman is going to spring on them any minute they go for a 3 mile run in the fresh air.  A house full of armed agents and the bad man still waltzes in and does what he wants.  Where were the kevlar vests then?   And one Zippo lighter manages to ignite cloth while everyone is trying to stop him?   I could go on and on but you get the message.  That's it for this author.  Don't we all wish for that magic computer that can just get into everything and find out everything?	2004-06-14

I use the library exclusively for my reading material. So this one did not come to me with reccommendation by a friend.  I grew up on the &quot;prairie&quot; and his descriptions are so on target it is scary.  I had an uncle die in a grain storage accident so it happens for sure.   By the end and the unveiling of one of the guilty parties, I was left to wonder which of the characters now living or dead were actually guilty of what.<BR>Wiltse is a very decriptive writer and I laughed til I couldn't see with some of the scenes, especially the &quot;stinking condition&quot; Billy would get himself into.

First how dumb was Kasey's late husband Mark that he accepted the fact she was pregnant and still married her?  His first suspect should have been his friend he asked to take her to the party, duh.   Then there were the little attention grabbing headlines in the the daily news that everyone took as gospel and jumped on the accusation bandwagon.

Would that we could all change for the better as easy as these characters. I too was surprised that crafty Matt just faded away in the face of a new and improved Angela.

I have read many of Luanne Rice's books, so there must be something I like about the stories.  I use the public library and buy very few books, thankfully so if I pick a bummer it's no big deal.   I found myself skimming over pages and pages at a time cause they were just too wordy and filled up with unnecessary descriptions and thoughts.  One reviewer said the characters were so realistic, but I disagree.  In reality would one gardening job provide enough income for a family of 4?    I also found the exchanges between the FBI agent and Bay to be a stretch.<BR>But all's well that ends well.

This is the first novel I have read that tells about life from a gay man's perspective.  Sometimes he seemed to be reluctantly gay but gay none the less.  I was sympathetic to siblings that remembered things differently from their childhoods, almost like they lived with different families, as is the case with siblings.

I found the inconsistencies a fault too, plus Malcome's first wife was called Polly in one part of the book and he talked about her as Becky in the last one.  I found the plot just too unbelievable.  What kind of grandpappy was he anyway? He sure didn't parcel out those babies with any concern to their futures or their pasts.  When two of the four were actually full sisters and the other two actually twins, why did he split them up by giving them to two different son's of his to raise?   I found it all a bit much and then to have two of the girl's mom be right there under their noses was the crowning touch.  You have to wonder how an author arrives at such twisted tales.	2003-12-15

Everyone comments on the incest, but it was just skimmed over in the story, except in James first revulsion in what he felt for his daughter Kathleen.  We don't find out anything about the episode of James with his daughter Frances except during Mercedes daydreaming flashback.   But it took us till the very last while Lily read her mother's diary to learn who her lover was.  Then it switches to James actions on arriving in New York to realize who the father is.     I just think it is so sad to read about people's lives that are so completely destroyed through lack of communication and compassion for one and another.

It was suspenseful enough to hold my interest,but was pretty slow moving.  The first 340 pages kept going over the same material and the story didn't start moving to a solution until the last 40 pages and then had a sloppy ending.  Much of the mess in the end could have been avoided if the characters hadn't been so slow to respond.  Too many gaps in the everyday activities of the main characters, that weren't where they should be when they should be and too much wandering off singly by the sisters that knew someone was out to get them.	2002-12-23

US	49051253	RDSXDUF6GW0A9	0671510053	357229344	The Shipping News	Books	1	1	4	N	N	Forget it!	I don't think I even read to page 100, just could not get into this book.  I read constantly and keep track of the books I read by author, by year to make sure I don't pick up one that sounds good that I have read before.<BR>I think the main reason I checked this out from the library was because it had been made into a movie.   All I could think about when I started it was the description of the main character sure didn't fit Kevin Spacey!<BR>So giving this one star even is not a qualified rating.  Sorry but no thanks.	2002-03-23

To not be aware of being followed and putting people who aided him lives at risk was just too much.  And when he does find Sabina again, he parks his car that has been chased for 2 months right out in front of the apartment she has been hiding in.   The story is being stretched out over 1500 pages and nothing new has happened so far.	2001-09-24
