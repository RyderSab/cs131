I got out of the book that you should not drop out of school and you should apply yourself.

This novel did teach me a fact thought that some African-Americans owned slaves before the Civil War which is something I never knew about.

He is the best author I have ever read and this book does nothing to dimish that accolade.  Life in those times, on a farm, kid growing up, learning life/death, how to take care of animals is all addressed in this novel as themes.  I think this book should be read by all junior high school students.  Students in the city will probably have a hard time relating but that is the best thing in a novel where it will take you places and times that you don't normally get an experience in.	2004-03-04

I had to really push myself to finish it and not put it down.  The Remains of the Day is his best novel.  This one is worth the read though to see the overall plot structure in the end.
