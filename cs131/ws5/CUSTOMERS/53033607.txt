It's a nice overview of many royals who are skipped over in the US, although the author dwells on some details for too long, and skims over others  (particularly in the British royalty section, although that may be a  relief).  The centerpiece, obviously, of the book is the Iran section which  details the role of three of its Pahlavi queens and also the Princess  Ashraf.  Although I certainly would have liked more in some sections  (particularly the Greek), and less in others (such as the long citation of  Queen Noor's achievements, which no one needs to know), overall the book  was a nice examination and provided some interesting details.	2000-05-10

Having little interest in the  Death Knight's personal story-because I'm just dabbing into Dragonlance  right now-I read it as a straight, linear book.        And it came off  rather well-done.  Quite literally, too, at the end when the gods bake all  major characters of the book (with the gory exception of three elf maidens  on the side of a certain road...).  But on the serious track, the book is  an interesting read for someone who doesn't try to poke through all the  tidbits of Loren Soth's life.          The biggest fault is not in the  prose or style of van Belkom, but rather that he never really delves into  Lord Soth's character.  Throughout the book, Loren Soth is the doomed man,  haunted by past misdeeds but also rationalizing his actions with his noble  title and reputation.  Yet though his madness is quite vivid in portrayal,  he is only a masked character, and one is inclined to feel more sorry for  say the trio of elves he cuts down on the way to (or depending on your  viewpoint, back from) Istar.         There are also some good parts about  the pyschology of the Kingpriest of Istar.  The Cataclysm isn't well  portrayed in this book, not a shame, but one does wish for more depiction  of the scene where the fiery mountain collides with the planet.  Of course,  the event has been detailed elsewhere so any extensive depiction here might  come off as redundant.         There is plenty of gore in the book, and  it's very much domestic in nature, and to some people it may be exceedingly  disturbing.  The murder of a wife and child is bad enough, but when  repeated... At the end, LORD SOTH is very much one of those books that is interesting  to read but lacking the Dragonlance atmosphere.  One can say the same thing  about THE IRDA, any of the Fifth Age books, and so on (and on the badly  faring side, there is THE DARK QUEEN...)  Good to read, but in the end it  felt like a distraction from Krynn's main road.	1998-11-29

Joining the ranks of lost histories such as THE IRDA and THE DARGONESTI, THE DRAGONS is an amazing conclusion to the series that sifts through the obscure races of Krynn.        People who want to know about the history of  Dragonlance's most focal race will love this book, which spans over 8000  years of history from the beginnings of the world to the defeat of Ariakas  at Neraka.  Even better: THE DRAGONS is not only an exceedingly detailed  &quot;history&quot; book, it's also a finely written novel in its own  right.          Of all the rich Dragonlance books, THE DRAGONS probably has  one of the largest casts.  Some four or five generations of the firstborn  race are detailed, starting with the children of Paladine's daughters and  finishing with the evil great-grandchild of Takhisis.  It's recommended  that you read &quot;Aurora's Eggs&quot; from THE DRAGONS AT WAR anthology  before this book, because the first chapters pick up right after the short  story.  The best part is, both stories are great reads on their own, even  better together but hardly necessary for enjoyment.        Douglas Niles  has quite an ability to juggle viewpoints, perspectives, and also gloss  over important events without making them seem frivolous.  For example,  whereas other books can spend chapters on the Cataclysm, the dragons are  unaware of the immense armageddon wreaking havoc on Krynn, and thus Niles  appropriately makes little mention of it.  The effect at the end is of one  long, arduous journey completed-but a journey that was enjoyable from the  start.         Also a testament to Niles is the fact that despite having so  many characters (he does appear to make some small lapses, however, in  numbers and mentions) he never lets the focal dragons slide.  Any other  author might fully develop the evil Crematia and leave her descendants  form-letter characters.  But the development of each personality is full,  although at the end, there are a handful of weaker characters.THE  DRAGONS is also excellent in how much history it spans.  THE LEGEND OF HUMA  (Richard A. Knaak) is retold in the viewpoint of the dragons, including the  adored silver dragon Heart.  The stories of the exile of the three moons of  Krynn, the creation of the evil draconians, the exodus to northern utopia,  and the return to ancestral Kharolis are only a few of the incredible  pageantry one will find in this book.  Unfortunately there is also plenty  of death, too, so much that it becomes predictable in the end, and this is  probably the biggest flaw I can find with the book.  Otherwise, it's a  shiner.         At the last page, it feels like Douglas Niles has written a  1000 page book, not a 300 novel.  A definite must read.	1998-11-29
US	53033607	R1QSUDO5G1C93Y	0671696033	350110378	Daughter of Destiny: An Autobiography	Books	4	8	10	N	N	Vivid, if incomplete, portrayal of Mrs. Bhutto	Benazir Bhutto is a striking personality-she is both hated and loved in  Pakistan, very much Indira Gandhi on a somewhat smaller scale.         Her  autobiography begins with her reaction to her father's death-Zulfikar Ali  Bhutto was hanged by General Zia ul-Haq after a military coup and the  pleadings of the world community.  Throughout the book, Benazir paints Zia  as the ultimate devil, the evil that consumed Pakistan and sent her family  into prison or death.        The book is extremely melodramatic in tone,  but to me it was quite appealing-not as a portrayal of Mrs. Bhutto's  personality but rather as another testament in the mixed reviews of her  reign.  The book ends with the votes about to be cast in her favor-and they  did.  Benazir was elected to two terms, but was dismissed by Pakistan's  President and replaced by political rival Nawaz Sharif.  She has been  accused of financial laundering and at one time had an arrest warrant  placed on her in Pakistan.         Though her character is now under  question, Benazir Bhutto still remains a well-spoken, articulate voice, and  there is no better reflection of these qualities than in DAUGHTER OF  DESTINY.  She speaks without much bitterness-there is only moderate waxing  of effluvium about the cruel fates her early destiny went through.  Though,  not having experienced life in Pakistan under her rule as Prime Minister, I  cannot form any political or personal view towards Mrs. Bhutto, one thing  is clear to me-she has the ability to make her voice heard.  Whether or not  she is 'defending' American airstrikes against the Taliban in Afghanistan  or speaking of how she believes her brother's shooting death was related to  a conspiracy to remove the 'Bhutto factor from Pakistani politics', Benazir  has an articulate and clear voice.  Now if only her morals and character  were so lucid.	1998-10-14

Famous artists such as Pete  Venters, Quentin Hoover, Donato Giancola, John Avon, and Terese Nielsen  create a stormy world wracked with strife and death.  We see the legendary  paintings, sketches, and drawings that breathe life into such places as the  Stronghold, the Skyshroud Forest, and the Dream Halls.  And vivid  characters are represented with handfuls of card arts, style guides, and  behind the scenes sketches.  This book lays out the story, environment, and  aura of the Rath Cycle experience in a conscientious, experienced form  which shows meticulous preparation and a beautiful final product.  Who can  forget the legendary Vanguard painting of the Dark Angel Selenia, poised to  strike at the onlooker?  Or Donato Giancola's Havoc, showing Orim  attracting the fury of the Furnace of Rath around her?  Or even the  paintings of the mischievous Squee, a goblin with a heart and intelligence  far beyond his peers.  And for a look to the dark side, the City of  Traitors, huddled around the gigantic Furnace of Rath.  <br />  The  Weatherlight, its crew, and every inch of the worlds of the Rath Cycle are  detailed beautifully.  One will want to look through the glistening pages  many times-everything holds a meaning just waiting to be unlocked.  Even  the title page for each chapter invokes curiosities: we see a depiction of  the Null Moon, Dominaria's artificial moon (and possibly something of ill  meaning from the Phyrexians?) and an added oval with each chapter's  progression.   <br />  The Art of Magic: the Gathering is without a doubt  among the best books to come out of Wizards of the Coast and TSR for a long  time.  A must buy worth every cent.	1998-08-30

It plows over some of the old storylines, but manages to present a coherent, plausible tale of the brothers Urza and Mishra. <br /> The book begins with a prologue-set on the 'night before the end of the world.'  It quickly follows up with an accurate depiction of the Brothers' lives under the artificer-scholar Tocasia, and then gradually progresses to the climactic meeting in the hidden Cave of Koilos.  There is some very interesting writing in the stages after this, when Urza courts the Princess Kayla bin-Kroog.  In general, the book is exemplary compared to most other Magic: the Gathering novels, though its memorable scenes mainly draw their power from the player's familiarity with characters, scenes, cards, etc.  Perhaps the most fascinating portion of this book i! s the meeting between Urza's son and the elven queen Titania, and the scenes that precede it-they are remarkably vivid and worth re-reading.  The final battle is not as exciting as should befit it, nor is the destruction wreaked by the magical Sylex (an artifact capable of destroying entire continents) but the rest of the book makes up for the drop off at the end.  Overall, an absorbing, faithful book.	1998-08-04

Most likely the Krynn aficionado will be more appreciative of the finer nuances of THE DRAGONS OF CHAOS but I found it a delight to read.	1998-08-04

The tension-charged confrontation between Vonotar the Traitor and the Guildmaster, the firestorm attack upon the city of Toran, and the flight to Holmgard are highlights of this book.	1998-07-24

An instrumental figure in the titanic Solti Ring, Culshaw's Ring Resounding offered a clear, bright view on Wagner's phenomenon, a 16-hour opera cycle that has been regarded, with the Chartres Cathedral at Notre Dame, as one of Western art's pinnacles.  Reflections does the same: it shows Culshaw's personal yet often virtually universal thinking.<br /> This book was drawn from Culshaw's lectures, in the intermissions, which appeared on the Met Opera broadcast of the entire Ring Cycle some years back.  Essentially this is a volume printed by popular demand.  Reflections is a &quot;middle ground&quot; to read.  The book's character analysis tends to be concise yet much more meaningful than the general pages and pages of review, and the same applies for the rest of the volume.  The connections forged by this book between Wagner's Ring and general humanity are strong, and Reflections is certainly a good companion to the Ring for those who seek to find a greater awareness within Wagner's work.  The photographs and illustrations are in the style of Wieland Wagner's famous Bayreuth productions.  They seem, to me, a perfect choice for the book.  John Culshaw's words are designed to get the reader thinking about Wagner's meaning: Wieland's sets and lightings are likewise very open to interpretation.	1998-03-29
US	53033607	RQITVKTPARQY9	0879101016	466986942	Ring Resounding	Books	5	7	7	N	N	Absolute essential	Justly called everything from &quot;the greatest recording of anything&quot; to &quot;the insurpassable&quot;, the legendary Ring of the Nibelungen Cycle deserves its rich history.  Most audiences' eyes will have already been caught by this fabulous work of Wagner's incredible genius, from the Levine/Behrens performance with the Metropolitan to the original Bayreuth productions.  Though there is an abundance of Ring recordings and several very fine complete Cycles on compact disc, few can even compare to the stunning Solti recording. <br />    John Culshaw's chronicle of the events leading into the titanic, historic feat of the Sofiensaal recording of the Ring is a stunning, open memoir.  There is valuable insight into the character of many of the singers, musicians, and producers.  There are unusual tales told in this book, from Regine Crespin's kick to insults directed at Kirsten Flagstad.  Furthermore, the entire book is written in an easy-going manner, so that it in no way resembles a stuffy, pompous book that could scare off the general populace.  Even if you are not familiar with the Ring Cycle, the book is an excellent stepping-stone.  To those who are, especially with the Solti recording, the book is invaluable.  Reading it will add a whole new dimension to the music: memoirs include countless events, including the orchestral squabbles with Decca at Die Walkure, Joan Sutherland's and Kirsten Flagstad's seemingly inadequate roles, Birgit Nilsson's performances, and the death of a beloved cast member of Das Rheingold, before the Ring's final, complete release.  The photographs are also tasteful: though many of them directly chronicle the event of recording, a great deal of the others set the mood of Vienna and the past history of the Ring. <br />  This book is indeed rare-I found only one copy at the local library.  Yet it is to me the most important book of its kind.  A must-have to all interested.	1998-03-29

A somewhat limpid followup to Crystal Singer, Killashandra focuses on the Crystal Singer Ree as she journeys to distant Optheria on an assignment to repair the Optherian organ-and spy on the planet. <br /> The Optherian Elders are panicked- it seems that a musician named Comgail has shattered the main manual for the grand Organ, which is vital to the annual Summer Festival (which naturally brings in large revenues from the tourism).  Killashandra, as an experienced pianist and crystal singer, must not only repair the organ but spy in Optheria.  <br /> Curiously, Optheria is a perfect world.  It is the picture of prim and proper, a planet of chastity.  But no one ever leaves Optheria, even though there are hundreds of  other planets to see.  <br /> As Killashandra explores, she discovers new love and a dark, startling secret.  Optheria's Elders are using the organs to subliminate and brainwash the populace, making them docile and ruthlessly suppressing any opposition from the rebel islands.  Furthermore, Killashandra finds herself in a terrible dilemna: for to leave Optheria, she must consign the man she loves to trial... <br /> Killashandra follows in the same style as its predecessor, Crystal Singer.  Our heroine Killashandra Ree is a bratty, melodramatic soprano courting the audience with her flashy on-off stage dialogue and actions.  <br /> The story begins some time after Crystal Singer: it is here that the one value that should have been repeated appears.  Killashandra is ruined: her black crystal claim has been destroyed, a sickness rages through her veins, and she must leave the man she loves to save him.  But it is soon  that her despair ends and an all-too perfect story begins. <br /> Right off the bat Killashandra is the perfect heroine with no flaws except her self-centered personality (which is actually a good attribute in this story!).  She sweeps into the scene, disrupts a dinner with the leaders of a foreign planet, and sweeps out to greet some delicacies that were placed in her room in the hopes they would satisfy her insatiable needs.  Every move Killashandra makes is absolutely perfect and flawless, as are those of Lars Dahl.  The rest of the cast, with few exceptions, is positively ludicrous. <br /> With the exception of Killashandra's character (which, as a side note, was better in Crystal Singer but not by much and dramatically improves in Crystal Line) and the perfect plot line, there are quite a few &quot;goodies&quot; in here.  McCaffrey's weaving is clear, and enjoyable to read.  Though I didn't find the island scenes enjoyable to read, many others have.  Furthermore, there is also the usual &quot;dark secret to the perfect paradise&quot; plot.  Very good, but as a whole not as good as Crystal Singer was.  Certainly there is room for improvement in this one.	1998-01-11
US	53033607	RJP79UUU6564X	0803714645	794841547	Doom of the Haunted Opera	Books	5	7	7	N	N	Very smooth transition from author to author	Brad Strickland must have faced a considerable task when he began the completion of John Bellair's books. For years, John's heroes of Anthony Monday, Johnny Dixon, Lewis Barnavelt and Rose Rita Pottinger kept the reader busy as they explored and fell into all sorts of settings and supernatural events.  From the Windrow curse to the dark secret of Weatherend, the books that Bellairs wrote captivated me, and it certainly wasn't just because of the plot twists and ever-changing settings.  Bellairs had a style of writing that made his books close to the reader, even with a setting in another time or even another dimension.  Brad Strickland has proved that the transition from the now unfortunately late Bellairs to him is going smoothly.  His Hand of the Necromancer did not fail as he went &quot;solo&quot;, and neither does the Doom of the Haunted Opera, which was begun by Bellairs as a sketch and finished by Strickland. <br /> Our Lewis Barnavelt and Rose Rita are stuck in cozy (But boring) little New Zebedee, waiting for excitement.  Discovering an old opera score, the excitement quickly comes when all adults in the town are swept up in the music rush.  The composer of the opera's grandson comes to town, and it is quickly revealed that he has more interests with New Zebedee's inhabitants than just performing a dusty old work and setting up shop at the local Four Seasons Hotel.  But unfortunately, pending the performance of an aria from the opera called &quot;The Sealing&quot;, a mysterious fog has descended upon New Zebedee and trapped everyone inside it.  And the sinister machinations of our dear villain (posing as the willing opera conducter, and world famous singer as well) go deeper and deeper...<br /> This book was very good; it provided the familiar characters fans of Bellairs' have grown to love yet produced a new predicament (the sealing off of the town, though this curiously resembles Lewis's imprisonment inside Barnavelt Manor in a previous Bellairs/Stricklandnovel, The Vengeance of the Witch-Finder) and a new villain.  Certainly Brad Strickland has pulled it off; Doom of the Haunted Opera is true Bellairs, yet Strickland has also managed to add a little of his own flavor into the story without warping its style.  Not as climactic and eerie as the Ghost in the Mirror (which I consider to be an incredible achievement) or as creepy as The Drum, the Doll, and the Zombie, but very good.  With the new books out, Bellairs' series have not died.  Brad Strickland has managed to continue the Bellairs spirit, but also with something new.	1998-01-03

The royal family returns from the heretic city of Akhetaten.  Several members meet unfortunate deaths.  The Queen cannot produce an heir.  In other words, just another day in old Mother Egypt.<br /> Now, the bad side of this comes in the form of the novel itself.  Normally I would wonder if there could be a book even worse than the previous A God Against Gods-but now I do not even fear the literary Hell...after I have been through Return to Thebes. <br />  The old devils of A God Against Gods return to haunt the reader.  Pompous prose, distanced characters, a flimsy plot that, while being somewhat historically correct, cracks immediately under the heat and pressure of the heavy, overdone words-that is what Return to Thebes subjects the reader to.  Yes, there are some good moments to this book, but they are even less than A God Against Gods.  A completely unsatisfying disgrace.	1997-11-30

Oddly enough, Pegasus In Flight was published before To Ride Pegasus.  Even more interesting are the characters.  It is recommended that you don't read the two books in order of publishing-instead, start on To Ride Pegasus and then move on to this also fine novel.<br />  The most interesting features of this novel are the appearances of familiar characters from other Talent Series books or their descendants or ancestors.  We see Sascha Roznine, undoubtedly a relative of Vascha Roznine in TRP; we see Dorotea Horvarth and her son Miklos; Rhyssa Owen is undoubtedly the daughter of Daffy op Owen; and perhaps most heartening of all, we see the first Peter Reidinger.  Later, in the Talent books, his descendant would become one of the best and most explosive personalities.  This all is very good, as it binds the novel to others in the series. <br />  Pegasus in Flight takes place one generation after To Ride Pegasus and centuries before the Rowan books. A call for Talents to work on the world-wide project of Padrugoi, which would be the stepping stone of mankind to the heavens, is led by the brutal Russian engineer Ludmilla Ivanova Barchenka, who will stop at nothing to strip Earth of its Talents.  In the midst of this gigantic, frenetic circus of a project lies foul play-Rhyssa, her future love interest, and others uncover terrifying statistics of some &quot;accidents&quot; that have been occuring on Padrugoi. <br />  In the meantime, Tirla is a scruffy girl living in the dark Linears of Jerhattan.  Here she ekes out a living by helping alleyway mothers elude the illegal-peoples check as well as doing various other deeds.  Her knack for languages makes her an important person in the Linear G-unknownst to her, this &quot;knack&quot; is actually a very strong Talent.  In the meantime, Tirla struggles to elude the perverted Yassim, who deals in unsavory uses of children stolen from the Linears or sold by their parents. <br />  Young Peter Reidinger was an ordinary boy until he was suddenly paralyzed.  This paralysis forced his mind to transfer motor functions to another part of the brain-and gave him a powerful Talent.  <br />  Rhyssa, Sascha, Dave Lehardt and the other Talented strive to save the kidnapped Tirla and Peter whilst evading Ludmilla Barchenka's persistent assaults for kinetic Talents.  And as they do, they meet danger, love, and dark plots and conspiracies head on. <br />    Pegasus in Flight is rather disappointing when compared to its beautifully written followers.  The plot was wonderfully done, only very often Anne would convolute or add some sort of detailing, or just something that would make it a little more &quot;muddled&quot;.  There are several very dry points, as in To Ride Pegasus, but there are some really wonderful scenes and pages and chapters that warrant reading over and over again.  <br />  Mostly Pegasus in Flight is a rather fine novel, but given a choice over this or the, say Rowan or Damia, the other Talent book would win.  Series fans must read-as for others, it is a very good stepping stone into the Talent world, giving the reader a full immersion into this far-future series, but the Rowan serves the purpose just as well.  Try it-you just might like it.	1997-11-27

The entire Lady of the Reeds revolves like a spinning top or like those tiles in old cathedrals around Lady Thu.  It is so unfortunate, then, as to how unpitiable the &quot;ambitious&quot; witch was made out.        As the book progressed, I had to ask myself, &quot;Where is the author of the Twelfth Transforming?  Where is Pauline of the Child of the Morning?  Where is that writing flair that accompanied the dangerously exciting domestic tragedy we call Mirage and the Canadians call Scroll of Saqquara?&quot;  The answer, it seemed, was that Pauline was in her nadir writing about one of the most detestable (to me) creatures to walk on the earth...and trying to make her seem all right.            It is almost humorous to see Pauline attempt to instil good into the Lady Thu-this entire thing mirrors Shostakovich attempting to justify all of Katerina Ismailova's crimes in Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk.           What is most striking is that the reader never really gets in with how the author intends the protagonists to be.  Thu is ambitious, good, but driven to do the things she must do-that is what the author says.  What Thu says, though, is &quot;I am evil, lazy, and decided to contrive my harem conspiracy simply because my emery board broke.  And by the way, I intend to break out of prison because 'tomorrow is a bright new, sunny day'&quot;.          But that is not all.  Pauline's greatest asset in her books was her capability to bring the pageantry and opulence of pharaonic Egypt to life in Child of the Morning and Twelfth Transforming.  She fails to do so here.  There is no marble flooring in Ramesses' time, and the Crown Prince Ramses was remembered mostly because his mummy was so ugly (as compared to the handsome Ramses in Lady of the Reeds).        Lady of the Reeds is not confined to one place, but its seemingly rapid shifting of rooms and scenes make it seem so.  Pauline's other book, Mirage, on the other hand, was confined entirelyto a domestic soap opera of &quot;dumb husband marries evil-and dead-woman, forces old wife to leave, brings about death of son, destroys three souls and eventually falls victim to machination of God Thoth&quot;.  Pauline actually makes this outrageous tale work, and wonderfully too.  Well, the plaster is cracked here and the foundation stone flawed.  Lady of the Reeds comes tumbling down, ending with Thu head over heels in the rubble and a lot of wasted marble, useless sideshow characters, and an idiot of a pharaoh.

US	53033607	R1HOF8NZHGJ77M	0385001991	545786849	A God Against the Gods	Books	1	4	15	N	N	A Pretentious, almost blasphemous heaving pomposity	Once in a while any reader will encounter a true terror of a book.  This inevitable fate came to me in the form of A God Against Gods and its almost as bad sequel, Return to Thebes.<br /> Most apparently appalling and offensive is the pomposity, the pretentious ways that the characters of the bizarre Amarna end of the illustrious XVIIIth Dynasty are portrayed.  Pharaoh Akhenaten's mysterious, romantic vision is reduced to screaming hysterics and overblown dramatics.  Princess Meritaten, who aspires to be the next Queen Hatshepsut, is even worse.  She is a plaster cast of a person, and unfortunately for the reader the plaster begins cracking from the start.  Characters to and fro are so weak, so distorted, and worst of all, so detached from the reader that I was tempted to hurl the library copy of the book across the room.<br /><br />Drama is wonderful in books.  In fact, for historical novels portraying the odd Royal Family of the late Egyptian 18th Dynasty, drama is a must.  But in this blasphemous, stuffed with chaff work, drama is the worst enemy of the book, the plot, and the reader.  Everywhere the characters only talk to themselves.  &quot;Presently I shall take poison&quot;, &quot;Oh, they are dead!&quot;, &quot;I am so nervous&quot;, all of these show the fatal cracks of Allen Drury's bilogy.  It is clear to the reader that unfortunately the author is incapable of bringing forth true emotions at many times, especially when he must have the character say explicitly just what he or she is feeling.<br /><br />But don't worry, prospective readers.  There are some meritorious things that partially bring back this horror from the clutches of literary Tartarus.  For example, the death scenes of Meritaten, Smenkhkara, Nefertiti, and the birth scenes of Ankhesenamun's children are very descriptive, and though too fanciful for some people's taste (i.e. though it is possible, the public murders of Nefertiti and Akhenaten do not completely reflect history) they are worth reading, the shafts of light that penetrate this overdramatic, even operatic novel.  But you may also find the book almost worthless, like I did.<br /><br />The final great crack in this book is the detachment of the characters.  The reader cannot identify with the characters at all, even though the characters reflect and talk to themselves extensively (which is usually the most effective way of conveying personality to the reader).  I had hoped that in their conversations with themselves the protagonists would reveal more of their bland, hidden characters, but instead they distance themselves from not only the plot and other characters but the reader.<br /><br />Read A God Against Gods and Return to Thebes...if you have nothing better to do except scrub mildew off of your bathtub.eading, the shafts of light that penetrate this overdramatic, even operatic novel.

US	53033607	RNNC6JBEA8L2W	0804101302	572078542	The Twelfth Transforming	Books	5	7	8	N	N	Absolutely a must-read	Personally, I believe that this is Pauline Gedge's Magnum Scriptus.  I have read her triumphant Child of the Morning, her Stargate, her Eagle and the Raven, and her House of Dreams and Illusions, and this one is the true triumph.  How ironic it is that the story itself is anything but triumphant! <br /> The bizarre cast of the Amarna royal family of Egypt is the subject of this novel.  Immediately the reader can tell that the book will revolve around several large characters, with the rest of the prolific cast revolving around them, very much like moons around planets.  <br /> At the center of the book is the tragic, aging heroine. Queen Tiye is the unforgettable protagonist that encompasses so many qualities she is almost ethereal.  Yet despite being a divine being in the eyes of her people, an empress of the most powerful nation on earth, Tiye is painfully human.  She is forced to marry her own son in the hopes that she can salvage the wreckage of the empires of Egypt.  She is forced to accept the murder of her daughter by her niece.  She is forced to make decisions that put Egypt on the balance.  And ultimately, the brave and illustrious queen commits suicide. <br /> Akhenaten is the visionary that romanticists have protrayed him to be.  The Sun Pharaoh is everything the reader expects: he is a dreamy, detached being, out of tune with his nation, his family, and even himself. He cares for none but his great god Aten. <br /> Nefertiti is the dominant power-struggler here.  She is part malicious, but this malice comes from the stress of being incapable of producing a male heir, from being forced with the choice of either commanding the murder of her cousin or dying herself, and from the horrors of a loveless marriage to a raving lunatic that is destroying all of Egypt.  One catches glimpses of everything from almost evil to frustration and soft emotion with Nefertiti, but nothing solid except for her pride and strength.  She is every bit the Great Queen and DivineOne as her part-enemy Tiye is. <br /> The book is filled with poignant scenes that history has left behind.  Ankhesenamun, Princess and Queen of Egypt, is the most striking.  She is the sole survivor of her family after her father, brothers, and husband are murdered, her five sisters die, one committing suicide, and her two children dying at birth.  The princess is jerked along with fate: after finding love in a marriage her husband is murdered, her children die, and she is compelled to marry her clever and scheming grandfather Ay.  The farewell scene where Ankhesenamun, now queen, bids goodbye to her mother, the funeral scenes where the royal family variously mourns or ignores the deaths of so many of their relatives, all touch the reader's heart.  <br /> This is a true must-read.  Though sometimes a little dry, Pauline Gedge lacks none of that luster she seemed to be missing in Mirage/Scroll of Saqquara.  Egypt truly comes to life under her hands in this novel.  Whether or not you like emotion, romance, or suspense, this book has it all.	1997-10-21

Set years before the Rowan, this book is an early indicator as to how powerful a writer Anne McCaffrey is. <br /> The reader is immediately captured by the wild plans of Henry Darrow and the discovery of psionic &quot;Talent&quot;. This far-off future world isn't as alien as one would expect: familiar allusions and settings only make the story even more real.  <br />  What is the greatest part of the tale is that Anne McCaffrey chose to focus mainly on women protagonists.  Charity, Amalda, Dorotea, Molly-they all have the grace and character that would later characterize the Rowan books.  Anne's male figures aren't too bad either-there is less of that macho bashing-type of sci-fi person and more of the sensitive and logical side.  <br />  But amidst love and war come even more surprises.  An incredibly powerful Gypsy woman leaves a path of death and theft across the city as she struggles with her life, which ends tragically.  A hard man has his eyes set on ruling the world, and to bring that dream about he uses Amalda, a simple girl with the power to control thousands of people.  And from death comes life: the newborn Dorotea has the power to find hidden Talents. <br />  Throughout this book the reader is immensely thrilled and satisfied.  To Ride Pegasus truly deserves to be given the attention other McCaffrey books get.	1997-09-28

Undoubtedly one is compelled to compare Cosette to its magnificent predecessor.  But even from a fair standpoint I could not find enough merits in this utter disgrace. <br /> First off: Kalpakian has truly turned the novel into what we call &quot;cheap trash&quot;.  Profanity streams steadily in and out of the book so often one wonders if Azelma has anything to do but swear.  The heroic characters of before have become beggars in the dusty and dirty alleyways of Paris.  Cosette herself, as promised, trips over the edge and falls into debasement-but she never gets back up.  The atmosphere of Cosette is permeated with the stench of rotting words and decomposing plots.  <br />  To compare Cosette to Les Miserables would be completely unfair, as few can ever hope to match Victor Hugo's genius.  But even read by itself Cosette gives the readers chills-alone, to a reader who has not read Les Miserables, Cosette is just plainly terrible.  Whilst I have read Les Miserables in all of its thousand page glory around seven times, Cosette has warranted only one reading before I happily returned it to the library shelf from where it came.  Don't bother with this book bursting at the seams with pulsing trash and garbage.	1997-09-28

When the reader begins the Rowan Series, this book convinces him or her that it is truly going to be good.  It opens innocuously enough: a remote mining settlement on the planet Altair; a large rainstorm; a mother rushing home with her parcels.  And a child in its sturdy little hopper, unaware that an immense amount of mud is about to slide into the Rowan camp in a wave of brown sludge and obliterate it so completely the rest of the planet won't know it's gone until days later...when the child broadcasts a psychic wail so loud the entire planet hears it.  The child's immense potential is immediately realized...  Thus begins the Rowan's tale and life.  It is a tale of courage, triumph and loss.  Still young, the Rowan loses two of her most treasured companions, almost loses her own life, and leads an entire star system and its collected minds to a triumphant defeat over an alien armada determined to exterminate the Human race once and for all.  And in the midst of all this she finds a true love, amidst the ruins of interstellar battle, a man whose mind is as powerful as hers.  And with the guidance she needs the Rowan discovers who her parents were and who she really is.  This book is a must-read for both readers of Anne Mccaffrey and the sci-fi genre in general.	1997-08-18

Were it not for the fact that it is the sequel to one of Anne Mccaffrey's most popular science-fiction books Damia could very well be about a real person in another time.  Damia is that real.  The reader is instantly captivated: Damia's little adventures when she is little, from innocent things like running around the Callisto Moon Base to getting caught inside a capsule at the worst possible moment draw from the reader everything from humor to even apprehension.  As the story matures so does Damia, and her roles become more than that of a mischievious child-she is a heroine, an average woman, and a phenomenon all in one.  Anne Mccaffrey was also careful to make sure that while the story centered on Damia, the other characters, some designed to stand on the sidelines until they  recieved the spotlight and limelight, developed as well, so the overall impression one gets is of a wonderful tale that is so intricate and rapturous you'd be hard pressed to put the book down.  There are more dangers to Damia than a pool and growing up, though-alien species are focusing on her world, and not all have benign intentions. Her wrenching battle with a terrible, malignant mind erodes a great deal of her, more than just her mental powers.  Fortunately she eventually emerges, fully recovered, to deal with a new species, one whose intentions are to ally with the Humans and to project both of them into a new era of peace and triumph. <br />  I must admit I was rather put-off by the novel when I saw it on the shelf: the Greek Damia ate her children, so I did not look forward to reading the tale, even if it were by Anne Mccaffrey. But when I read the Rowan, and then started on Damia, I realized the instant I opened up the book this is not that Damia: the heroine I read was a brave, compassionate, and human character, and I'm certain you will agree.	1997-08-14

Although I have read many of Anne's novels, Damia's Children truly captured my imagination and interest.  The book opens leasurely, some years after its predecessor, the book Damia.  The beautifully written openings describe in great detail the individual characters of Damia's Talented children, but it foreshadows the menace the reader expects.  And true to its promises, the book plunges into an exciting expedition where the combined fleets of both the Human and Mrdini species track down the home world of their decades-old enemies, the Hive.   But this book is not just about space-battles and &quot;star wars&quot;.  The reader witnesses the growing-up and maturing of Damia's four eldest children, and we even see glimpses of characters that one would expect to be obsolete: the Rowan, Isthia Raven, and the rest of Damia's children's predecessors who played such a large part in previous books.  The book is definitely, without a doubt, a must-read, especially if you have read the previous two books, The Rowan and Damia..	1997-08-14

Anne McCaffrey's Crystal Singer trilogy was incredibly written, but Crystal Singer shone the brightest.  Anne paints the picture of Killashandra Ree: a woman with no prospects on her home planet, a woman who turns to a mysterious guild and risks her memory and life to be one of the Crystal Singers.  Killashandra is vividly alive: by the time the reader has read about fifty pages he or she will virtually not be able to tell the difference between her, a paper and ink girl, and a real one.  Her thoughts, her actions and her emotions are astoundingly realistic.

Song of Time, spanning the legacy of an ancient spell that could destroy all of the multiverse, is an immersive, intricate, and certainly well-written novel.  The characters are developed to the point where you feel that you know them better than you know the palm of your hand, the settings made so real you can feel the sun burning on your back at the sandy ruins of Old Sumifa.  Dialogue is just...well, real!  The characters have different voices, and the voices appear not only in dialogue but in thoughts.  The assassin Saelin's malicious and nefarious mental conversations with himself make for a truly interesting picture.  And there is that atmosphere: although the adventurers travel from the trash-ridden Barca to the ice-kingdom of Drufalden the reader feels an exotic tone overlaying it all (although at times that sense comes only from a discarded hair ribbon!). <br />   Song of Time is an astounding and amazing book, and unlike other novels you can read it over and over again without tiring.

Many years ago the Shianti created a magical artefact called the Moonstone, but this relic disrupted the balance of the world of Magnamund, and the Shianti were forced to seal it into a Trianon in the plane of Daziarn as well as remain forever on the Isle of Lorn. <br />  Some time later, a great wizard called Shasarak rose to power.  Aided by the Shadakine, great warriors from the Sadai Desert, Shasarak brutally destroyed all major nations of Southern Magnamund, creating a vast empire.  The Shianti watched with fear as Shasarak grew in power, and someday the fates have promised that the evil tyrant will cross the Sea of Dreams to the Isle of Lorn and fight with the Shianti for total domination once and for all...<br />  Aided by seven sisters, the Shadakine Wytches, who possess mastery of animal language, evil magic, and the Kazim Stones, magical hearts of creatures of stone, Shasarak also mastered vast legions of daemons and spirits, and has ruthlessly persecuted the pilgrims of the Shianti and other religions.  Once, long ago, Shasarak had control of a wondrous but terrible artefact called the Sunstone, a gem that had the power of the sun, but its abuse led to the destruction of an entire civilization...with power like that the Wytch-King has all of the human nations in his iron grip. <br />  The Shianti, unable to help, prayed for assistance.  And on the stormy night when Shasarak was crowned King of the Shadakine Empire, a ship ran aground.

But your most dangerous foe is not of an inhuman empire: he was one of your countrymen, and he has revealed the deepest secrets of Sommerlund.  Orchestrating the destruction of the Kai and much of Sommerlund, Vonotar the Traitor is possibly the most powerful magician in the world of Magnamund, for he has bound both good and evil magic together.

The Sword of the Sun is also the name of the book that encompasses both The Tides of Treachery and this The Sword of the Sun.  That book is extremely hard to find.  This volume of Lone Wolf Legends chronicles the results of Vonotar the Traitor's betrayal to Sommerlund.       Vonotar the Traitor, after failing to overthrow the Guildmaster of Toran and exploding one of his brethren's heart  (The Guildmaster had named Vonotar to be his successor, ironically) fled to the Darklands, with both advanced knowledge of good magic and a rudimentary knowledge of the Nadziran arts, the black magics.  Upon arriving in the Darklands, the sorcerer was met by a pack of Giaks, the stupid and evil spawn the Darklords breed for slaves.  Befriending a Giak, which he named Carag (Vassagonian for &quot;cesspool&quot;), Vonotar flew to the Darkland fortress of Kaag, the citadel of Archlord Zagarna.       Vonotar exchanged with the evil being knowledge that could destroy Sommerlund for knowledge of the Nadziranim arts.  Now skilled in both black and white magic, Vonotar had effectively married both together.  His magical prowess was enough to make him the most powerful sorcerer in Magnamund, the world Lone Wolf takes place upon, but Zagarna had exacted a price for the exchange: should Vonotar turn on him, the Nadziranim sorcerers would scatter the sorcerer's body to the four winds.       Vonotar had manipulated all of the other Darklords in believing that he was superior to all of them but Zagarna.  He slowly insinuated his power, and Zagarna grew weaker and weaker...       With the Darkland army poised to conquer Sommerlund, the Kai hero Lone Wolf must journey far to take the Sommerswerd, the Sword of the Sun.  Vonotar has learned of Lone Wolf, the last of the Kai, and has made preparations to make sure the warrior never reaches his destination of Hammerdal...

When I was eight years old I fingered through my cousin's high school version of Les Miserables.  I caught glimpses of names that fascinated me: Fantine, Cosette, Eponine, Azelma, Thenardier, Marius, Jean Valjean.  It has been three years since I flipped through that book, and I have just completed Les Miserables.<br />  Les Miserables is very much like a Requiem.  Its sweetness is from its sadness.  Victor Hugo could have written this tragic tale only if he had been touched by a pain so profound he was changed for life, and the sad backstory of his life alone brings the pain in this book to life. At points in the story his words almost seem to burst with torrents of tears in ink, and it is amazing he can control his rhetoric and prose at these times.<br />  This incredible novel defies words.  Words cannot describe the incredibleness, the magnificence, and the quiet somberness that the tale captures.  From the bustling streets of Paris to the weeds that conceal Jean Valjean's final resting place, the descriptions alone make Les Miserables so real I feel like I have been in Paris forever, even though I have never been to France.  I first found Les Miserables in this version at a little bookstore, and promptly sat down and read through the wonderfully steady entrance of the book to Jean Valjean's wretched debut, all the while gripping the pages tightly without realizing it.  By the time I was finished, the book looked like it had gone through the blender, but that did not tarnish the charm and the magic of the tale captured in ink and paper.  Nowhere else have I been able to find such a magnificent work.<br />  I never did see the musical, or hear it on CD or tape.  I didn't need a play to bring life to a tale so life-like that  if it weren't only ink and paper I would not be able to tell the difference between real and unreal.  Whether or not you are just a teenager or an octogenarian, Les Miserables is for everyone.  It is such a pure and unstained work of inner beauty that anyone can appreciate it.  The evil and good expressed in this amazing tale defies words.<br />  I know no French, and therefore I do not know what bourgeouis is and all those intriguing if not accurate bits in The Year 1817.  I have found that you could have a vocabulary of a seven year old and still be deeply touched by Les Miserables.<br />  After I read the book (and the quality of this version was incredible) I felt as if I had gone through a long journey.  The book's most beautiful feature is that it does not dwell overly and completely on sad matters: there is always that little undertone, but brightness does shine.  The reader feels little pain knowing that Jean Valjean has finally rested, and Fantine's life before the dramatic despair that follows the disappearance of Cosette from her life is wonderfully bright-but it makes the tortuous life of Fantine afterwards even more painful to read.<br />  Les Miserables is something that you must read.  Nowhere else will you find love, war, hate, despair and pain all put into one beautiful, magnificent package	1997-04-11
