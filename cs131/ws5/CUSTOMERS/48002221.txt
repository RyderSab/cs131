Stephanie's sixth outing is slightly better than her fifth. <br />For one thing, the romance sub-plot is not so prominent here as in the previous book. The humour which made the series popular is also back. Along with Grandma Mazur there's the Mooner, the Dealer and two vicious but thoroughly incompetent thugs who all guest star as Hot Six's comic casts. Mind you, they are not there just for the laughs. All of them are somehow essential to the overall plot. <br />The plot, as with all Stephanie Plum books, is not really important. It never has been. We read the books for the humour and/or the romance. In book six the humour level is up a notch and the romance down a notch, thank goodness. That made reading the 300-odd pages a breeze.<br />Better than High Five but not as good as One for the Money. So I'm giving it 3 stars.	2002-05-24

In fact, it gives a whole lot of way! Female readers will enjoy this book but the discerning crime-fiction fan probably wont (no matter what their gender).<br />If you already have the first four books and must have this one in your collection, then buy it. Its your money. But if you dont mind, then skip it. Its a dud. Unless of course if you enjoy reading romance novels pretending to be mystery novels.<br />The two stars are for Grandma Mazur. Otherwise, I'd give it just one star.	2002-05-20

I don't hate his work but at the same time I don't wait for his next book with bated breath either. He is just an author whose books never ever appear on my 'must buy' list.<br />Saying that, however, his novel \\"Christine\\" is a cracking read. The scares are subtle; tugging at your subconscious rather than going for your jugular vein. There are no ghouls lurking and not much violence either...at least not until the latter half of the book.<br />Readers who are looking for gore will be disappointed and should look elsewhere. Basically, \\"Christine\\" is about a possessed car. You don't own Christine. She owns you. And now she owns Arnie Cunningham; a shy, geeky kid with a bad complexion. Arnie loves Christine. He'll do anything for her and no one should stand between him and his beloved car. Or else.....<br />Stephen King does a wonderful job here. What could easily have been a cheesy story of an evil car on a killing spree, we have instead a story of obsession, possession and the stain of past crimes \\"reaching out to the present\\". More subtle, more frightening than a simple 'bad car kills people' plot.<br />We also get to learn the history of the car and its first owner but King doesnt give all the details. In fact, more questions are raised intead of answered. That, I think, is a mark of a good horror story. Let it be ambiguous. Dont answer all the questions. Let the reader draw his/her own conclusions. Its scarier (and thus, more fun) that way.<br />Stephen King is still not one of my favourite authors but I am willing to give credit where credit is due. \\"Christine\\" is indeed a good yarn and deserves the 4 stars that I'm giving. Coming from a non-fan, that is high praise indeed.	2002-05-06
US	48002221	R30TM4WH2E4LCL	0060082739	92035455	Gallows Thief	Books	3	18	22	N	N	Race against time	Bernard Cornwell, famous for his Sharpe series, has now ventured into the historical whodunnit genre. While it was a good book overall, this reviewer felt that it was quite lightweight.<br />The protagonist, Rider Sandman, has been tasked by the Home Secretary to determine the guilt or innocence of Charles Corday, due to be hanged in a week. The more Sandman investigates, the more convinced he is of Corday's innocence. But to steal Corday away from the gallows (hence the title) Sandman has to present hard evidence to the Home Secretary. <br />There is nothing special about the characters in the book. Sandman is well rounded enough. He is more Poirot than Sam Spade; honest, intelligent and principled. Endearing to him will not be difficult.<br />However, the rest of the cast seem like stock characters from any novel set in the 19th century. The rogue, the wench, a couple of rich aristocrats with manners of a pig...they're all there. There's even a surprise witness who naturally doesnt turn up till the end of the book to wrap things up nice and neat.<br />All in all, veterans of crime fiction may not be impressed with this simple effort. Fans of Cornwell might want to try it for no other reason other than because it was written by their favourite author. But if you want to wait for the cheaper paperback version, I wont blame you.<br />A 3 star book.	2002-05-01

Jackson's Haunting delivers while Matheson's Hell House doesn't. <br />The author failed to make the reader feel any sympathy for any of the 4 sacrificial lambs...sorry, protagonists. Not for the scientist Barnet, nor for his wife, nor for the enthusiastic Florence and no sympathy either for Ben Fischer, the sole survivor of a previous expedition to the house. Lacking a character to root for, one felt like an outsider distantly observing these characters running around without caring what happens to them. What could have been a great book became a mediocre one. <br />The only saving grace is the brief history of Belasco and Belasco House as told by Ben Fischer. Reading Belasco's origin and the depravities he brought to the house is like looking at a gruesome accident. You'll feel disgusted but you can't help looking anyway. <br />Unfortunately, Fischer's tale lasts only for a few pages. After that its back to not very frightening scares and low-level thrills. Mind you, there was one chilling scene when Florence the medium was attacked by a cat. The description of the attack was such that one could almost feel the cat biting and clawing on one's self. But one good scary scene in an almost 300 page novel does not a good horror novel make.<br />Richard Matheson is a great writer. He has written excellent stuff such as, \\"I am Legend\\" and his collection of short stories, \\"Nightmare at 20,000 feet\\" is a must have. \\"Hell House\\" however is not an essential book to have in your library. So Stephen King likes it. So what? He aint God.<br />For a very good haunted house novel other than the aforementionedShirley Jackson's \\"Haunting...\\", I heartily recommend Susan Hill's \\"WOMAN IN BLACK\\".	2002-04-11

Its very rare for the publishers to commission a Trek book featuring the non-human races. But when they do they are usually quite good. A STITCH IN TIME and THE 39th RULE are two good examples.<br />MY ENEMY MY ALLY on the other hand is okay. Just okay, in my opinion. Not Wow, Great or Amazing. Perhaps because it did not reveal much on how and why the Romulans think and behave they way they do. It does offer a brief glimpse of their political structure though. A structure based on cronyism, favours and mutual interests and not one based on merit. In other words, just like 20th century Earth! Also, author Diane Duane breathes life into the Romulan language which is perhaps far more taxing on the tounge than Klingon. D. Duane's talent has always been character development and it shows here.<br />The characterisations of the Kirk and co. are also spot on. The cunning Kirk, grouchy Bones, unflappable Spock. Its all there. There is a particularly amusing scene where the good Doctor beat Spock in 4D chess. The Vulcan was so surprised he almost showed an expression. Almost. The scenes featuring the Horta ensign were nicely written as well.<br />The plot itself comes in second after the interesting vignettes one gets to read in both the Romulan and Federation chapters. It is basically about an out of favour Romulan commander who decides to turn traitor because she is disgusted with the Empire's new secret project:- harnessing the mind powers of the Vulcans. Imagine a secretive race like the Romulans with strong almost psychic capabilities of the Vulcans. They could rule the Alpha quadrant in no time. With the help of Kirk, the Romulan commander intends to foil the project.<br />If you like Trek, you will no doubt like MY ENEMY MY ALLY. Its a quick fast read. If you have never read Trek but would like to start somewhere, this book is good place to start.ok is good place to start.	2002-04-02

He complained about the cookie cutter characters, the similiarities of the plots in all the books and the lack of humour. He believed that if it wasnt for the female fans, the Stephanie Plum series would have disappeared a long time ago.<br />Well, to each his own.<br />I am a male reader and a new fan of Janet Evanovich's (JE) sassy and ditzy bounty hunter. The characters are over the top and zany and, yes, can be found in other genres like cop shows and sitcoms. Perhaps that is why the series is so sucessful. The readers are familiar with the cast and find it reassuring. It doesnt matter whether Grandma Mazur sounds like that old woman from the &quot;GOLDEN GIRLS&quot;, never mind the fact that Ranger reminds one of Batman or that Lula, Joyce, Morelli, Vinnie, Connie and the rest all sound as if they came straight from Central Casting. It does not bother the fans because obviously that's what they WANT. Otherwise the series would not, at the time of writing, have 8 books in it. <br />About the similiar plot lines...well, that's nothing new in a long running series. Stephanie Plum is a bounty hunter. All her books are about her hunting down people who didnt turn up in court after they've been bailed by Vinne the bail bondsman. Usually the reason they skipped court is connected with the pile of bodies that Stephanie discovers in every book. Along the way she meets kooky characters, violent thugs and has lots of fun dodging bullets and other attempts on her life. <br />In every, single, one of her books. <br />Now, doesnt that fit the description of practically every popular long running series in print out there? Laurell Hamilton's Anita Blake series, Carl Hiaasen's Florida crime capers, even Grisham's legal dramas have been accused of being carbon copies of each other. Other big name authors who have been accused the same are Stephen King, Tom Clancy and Sue Grafton(who was the author that the male reviewer recommended every one read instead of JE).<br />What makes up for the lukewarm mysteries, and lets face it they are lukewarm more often than not, is JE's great dialogue and hilarious situations that she puts Stephanie in. Most of it revolves around Stephanie and Grandma Mazur or Stephanie and the street wise Lula. In book four, though, there's a new character in the form of Sally Sweet who is a cross dresser and gets tangled up in Stephanie's latest case. I havent read books 5, 6, 7 &amp; 8 so I dont know if Sally becomes a regular. By the end of the book she moves in with some friends and no more is said of her (waittaminute...its a GUY...why am I referring him as &quot;her&quot;?). I hope he appears in later books. He's an asset to Stephanie's ever growing posse. <br />Yes, the writing is formulaic. Yes, the characters are nothing special. Yes, you will probably have that &quot;been there, read that&quot; feeling. But my advise to JE is, &quot;If it aint broke, dont fix it.&quot; Your many fans are having lots of fun reading your books so far and when it gets boring and tiresome, we will just tell you by not buying any more of your books. Here's hoping that that day is somewhere in the faaarrrr future.<br />As Lula would say, &quot;Damn skippy&quot;	2002-04-02

Those who are checking out the series the first time should get the &quot;Three Plums in One&quot; Omnibus. Those who didnt return after finishing the second book, though, should hop on back onto the bandwagon. Its okay. All is forgiven. <br />The gang's all here. Connie, Lula the ex-hooker, Ranger, Morelli, Pa and Ma Plum, Grandma Mazur and Rex the lovable hamster. Steph is still a bumbling agent but slightly more experienced now. She's very out of shape though. In one scene, Ranger finished 50 push ups in five minutes while Steph managed to squeeze in...one! <br />Ranger plays a more active role here than in the second book. Not only is he assisting Stephanie in her search for her FTA but is also pushing her to get fit with early morning jogs. This is one thing that I found inconsistent though. In the first book we read that Stephanie likes to run a few miles to stay in shape. But now Ranger has to force her to exercise. Mind you, the story did take place in the cold month of January and Ms. Plum isnt that obsessive on fitness anyway (she eats doughnuts like a cop, fer crying out loud!). <br />But this is to nitpick.<br />The story itself is fast-paced. The dead bodies are piled high (as per usual), the mystery keeps you interested and the humour is very tongue in cheek. <br />Its the humour that stays in your memory long after you've finished the book:- Stephanie's hair turning orange after a visit to the hairdresser's (&quot;You look like Ronald McDonald&quot;); or when Stephanie's mom and grandma had their noses pressed to the glass pane, squinting into the night waiting for Stephanie and all she could say to Ranger was, &quot;My sister's normal. Always has been.&quot;<br />I guess you had to be there. <br />So be there.	2002-03-27

Janet Evanovich (JE) doesnt turn her heroine into an expert bond agent in 20 pages or less. Stephanie Plum doesn't run around with guns blazing a la Dirty Harry from the word go. She's new in the bounty hunter job and it shows. She makes mistakes. Dumb ones too. Even better, she's willing to admit it. And that makes the story even more alluring. Seldom do we read of a protagonist who is not already an expert in his or her field. Of course JE has the luxury of a series to groom Ms. Plum and 'ONE FOR THE MONEY' is the best debut I've read for a long time and the best place to start the series (obviously, since its the first book...duhh). This way the reader can witness Stephanie's evolution from ditzy deadbeat to experienced agent as the series progresses.<br />The fugitive she has to apprehend used to be the kid who took away her virginity when she was 16. Now Joe Morelli's a cop on the run, wanted for shooting an unarmed man. Her search for him quickly turns into an investigation into whether or not he shot a man and why. <br />The book alternates between funny and scary. The funny part is when she has to go to dinner at her parents' in the \\"burg\\". Her grandma is just hilarious (she's even funnier in subsequent books). Watch out for the scene involving Grandma Mazur, a loaded gun and a roast chicken. If you dont laugh after reading that, you have no soul.<br />The scary part is when she is stalked by a crazed boxer named Benito Ramirez. Benito likes to hurt women and he wants to hurt Stephanie the most. The gruesome scenes are when Benito tortures (and rapes?) a woman and forces Stephanie to listen and when he beats up Lula the prostitute because he saw her talking to Stephanie. <br />This balance of light hearted and tense scenes make for a cracking read. Veteran bond agent Ranger, Vinnie the bail bondsman, his secretary Connie, Stephanie's parents and her grandma Mazur make up a great supporting cast and contribute even more to a wonderful series debut.<br />Click on the \\"Add to shopping basket\\" button now.	2002-03-26

After a wonderful debut, one would expect something better or at least on par in the follow up but I did not find it here.<br />It is still a good read though. This time Stephanie Plum is hunting Kenny Mancuso who jumped bail for shooting his friend in the knee. Soon after, his friend is found dead and the trail leads back to Kenny. In the meantime, our heroine is hired by a mortician to find 24 coffins that has gone missing. Who would want to steal a coffin, never mind 24? Stephanie doesnt want to know but the with the rent due and money being a problem....well, beggars cant be choosers.<br />There's less of Ranger in this book but more of Grandma Mazur. In fact, the old woman takes an active part in this book. She is even more hilarious here and even has the chance to give the Dirty Harry speech. Other amusing vignettes include Stephanie finding a parking space big enough for a Buick, Grandma's visits to the funeral parlour and the Plum family staring at a penis just before having dinner (well, I thought it was funny).<br />But what about the story itself? It felt stretched out, truth be told. Could've ended 100 pages sooner. The funny parts were indeed funny but the tense parts weren't. Stephanie's ineptness at apprehending her man makes it frustrating to read sometimes but it has to be remembered that Steph is still a rookie learning the ropes. <br />Overall, it is not a bad read. If you want to stick to the series then you'll have to get \\"TWO FOR THE DOUGH\\" if nothing more than to have a complete collection and to follow the developments in Stephanie's life. But if you're a first time reader then start with \\"ONE FOR THE MONEY\\", rush thru this one and then enjoy the third book.	2002-03-26

Thankfully there aren't many but they do exist. Perhaps she should not have mixed genres (spy thrillers and crime). Mind you, there isn't a James Bond chase scene in the book but the opening pages takes the reader to a fictional Arab nation on the verge of a coup d etat and sees its young prince exchanging ideas with his English pilot on how to smuggle out the royal jewels.<br />I am not spoiling anyone's surprise when I say the deaths in this novel are connected directly or indrectly to the jewels (which have ended up in a girls school, by the way). The three murders all come rather late in the book and as such the revelation of the culprit by Poirot feels rushed.<br />Yes, the book is touted as a &quot;Hercule Poirot mystery&quot;  although we only get to see him three quarters into the story. Since almost all of the investigation was handled by the local inspector, an undercover Special Branch officer and a very intelligent girl, it would have been better if they tied it all up with no need for Poirot to show up.<br />All in all, I was not impressed with Cat Among the Pigeons. Those new to her work should start with other titles as this one may turn them off Agatha Christie, who was a good mystery writer actually. Her mystery novels usually ends with the reader (me, in this case) gasping and going, &quot;Damn! She's good.&quot; <br />This one didn't. Nuff said.	2002-03-14

It has a twist which few readers, if any, could have guessed beforehand. For that alone I'm giving it 4 stars. Not 5 because even though the story is good, I dont think it deserves the full 5 stars. <br />Its a typical English countryside murder which Agatha Christie is famous for. There is something about the English countryside that attracts crime writers to it. Perhaps it is the chilling fact that the genteel and peaceful facade of the country sometimes hides a hypocritical and evil nature of some of its populace. You'd expect this in the cities but not in Warmsley Heath or Meadowbank or wherever. \\"I wouldnt have thought that nice Mrs So and So down the street poisoned her husband. Gosh! The very idea!\\" <br />Well, a woman did poison her husband. Someone found out and is blackmailing her. Roger Ackroyd knows who the blackmailer is. Roger Ackroyd is found dead. Enter Hercule Poirot.<br />This book has been equally praised and criticised. It is praised for its audacity and ingenuity in fooling the reader and criticised for its mediocre style of writing. I do agree that Agatha Christie is not really a good writer per se but she is a good MYSTERY writer. She may be accused of writing poor dialogue and filling her books with one-dimensional characters, but she makes up for it by giving her readers damnably tricky conundrums. I suppose she can be compared to Tom Clancy. Clancy's prose makes the reader roll his/her eyes sometimes but damn it, he can write a battle scene! As can Christie when it comes to a murder mystery.<br />This novel is one of her greatest conjuring tricks and is worth subsequent reads to find out how Christie deceives her readers. The story is straightforward enough but it is the twist in the end that leaves the reader going, \\"Well, I'll be darned...\\"	2002-03-12

The world famous case of the \\"Murder on the Orient Express\\" (MotOE). It is so famous, even people who have never read Christie know who did it. I first read it 12 years ago even though someone had already revealed to me the identity of the murderer. I've never forgiven him. But I read it anyway to find out for myself how Agatha Christie constructed the story in order to fool her readers.<br />Christie was probably inspired by the true story of the 'Lindbergh baby' kidnapping. Charles Lindbergh (he who flew across the Atlantic alone) had an infant child who was kidnapped and murdered even after the ransom had been paid. <br />The background to MotOE is also similar to the Lindbergh case. The victim is revealed to have been involved in a kidnap-murder case a few years back and got away with it. Was he punished for his crimes at last? Was he murdered for something totally unrelated? Or was he a victim of mistaken identity? <br />The usual suspects remind one of the typical English drawing room murder mysteries: an English colonel, a Russian princess, a count, a beautiful mysterious woman...they are all here. And Hercule Poirot has to discover who the murderer is and why, all by using his \\"little grey cells, mon ami.\\" <br />The revelation in the final pages will surprise the reader yet it will not strain belief too much. MotOE has been accused of being incredulous and downright silly but I disagree. Those who feel that way probably forgot that they are reading a fiction novel. I am sure one will find it a lot of fun if only to find out who from among the varied cast did it. You'll be gobsmacked, I assure you :)<br />The solution will also show the reader why MotOE is famous in its uniqueness and has never been copied (no writer dares to).<br />Another Agatha Christie mystery that features an incredible revelation and giving an \\"I would never have guessed that\\" feeling to the reader is \\"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd\\". Both the Ackroyd and the Orient Express booksshould be in the Murder Mysteries Hall of Fame, if there is one.	2002-03-12

And if you can spot the major clue which Christie practically signposted on page.....well, all I'm saying is that if you can spot it then you'll probably have a good hunch who did the dirty deed. <br />Or would you?<br />For the case IS puzzling as more bodies begin to pile up (three people die in the book). Poirot himself is confused and asks, \\"If A has a motive to kill C and B has a motive to kill D, would it make sense if A killed D and B killed C?\\"<br />Perfect book for that 2-3 hour plane, train or car ride.	2002-03-12

A great collection of 'howdunnit' mysteries. Murder most foul (the fictional kind of course) is made more fun for the reader when the crime was committed in an impossible manner. How did a fresh corpse end up in a coffin which has laid undisturbed for two decades? How did the murderer-thief escape from a 10th floor showroom that was constantly under observation (and with only one exit...guarded, naturally)?<br />Most of the short stories here were written specifically for this book but there are some great classics as well like &quot;The Silver Curtain&quot;, &quot;The Adventure of the Jacobean House&quot; and my personal favourite, &quot;Off the Face of the Earth&quot; by Clayton Rawson.<br />I admire the authors who must have racked their brains to come up with ingenious, incredible, seemingly impossible yet logical solutions to their stories. The reader is challenged to solve it but amateurs like me just dont bother. I prefer to sit back and enjoy the ride.<br />As I write this, amazon.com has does not have ready copies of this anthology. Since its a UK published book, I advise potential sleuths to log onto amazon.co.uk. They have more copies of this book than they know what to do with!!	2002-01-04
US	48002221	RT7HBFDAWM54	0061040967	373959935	The Last Hero: A Discworld Fable (Discworld Novels)	Books	4	41	43	N	N	Great stuff but not for Disc newbies	If you're new to the Discworld, then &quot;The Last Hero&quot; is not the place to start. Sure you can read and still enjoy it but you'll enjoy it even more if you already have some background knowledge of this wonderful fantasy world (like why is the Librarian an ape and how come the best lawyer in Ankh is a zombie?)<br />For those of us who have joined the roller coaster ride that is the Discworld novels, this coffee book production is must have if only for the great Kidby artwork. In fact, I think the book was more Paul Kidby's than Terry's.  The all-too-short story, it seems to me, played second fiddle to the visualisation of well known characters like Rincewind, Carrot and Cohen.<br />Saying that though, the tale isnt half bad. Old Cohen the Barbarian, last seen in &quot;Interesting Times&quot;, goes on a final big quest. He and his compatriots, the Silver Horde, may not survive the quest. Thats not the problem. The problem is Cohen's quest may cause the end of all life on the Disc. Enter Rincewind....<br />After growing up reading Disc books with cover art by Josh Kirby, its quite strange (but not much) to see a different version of well known characters. Rincewind as drawn by Kidby is younger and Carrot more handsome. The Librarian is...dare I say it?...cute and Ponder Stibbons looks like Harry Potter.<br /><br />But the most beautiful of all are the splash pages throughout the book. Great A'Tuin, City of Ankh-Morpork, the sea water dropping off the edge of the Disc, the Silver Horde with Cohen leading the charge....Simply eye candy par excellence!<br />Also, check out the 'Mona Lisa' in page 30. Better than the original HAHAHAHA!!<br />Finally, this is also the first Discworld novel that share the same cover in both UK and US. Usually, the US covers are just dead boring. How come they cant use the Josh Kirby covers for the American editions?? Too much red tape??	2001-11-14

Adults will enjoy it too	Its a Discworld tale aimed at younger readers (ages 9-12) but I dont care. Its a DISCWORLD novel, people! Besides, if kids can enjoy the &quot;regular&quot; Discworld books, why cant an adult enjoy this one? <br />Terry Pratchett (TP) does not patronise his target audience in this novel. The storyline tackles heavy issues but done in such a way that it wont turn off the younger mindset. Such is TP's creativity that he's able to tell a tale for his younger fans without appearing to be a doddering old man preaching to the kiddies. In fact, his fans of all ages will laugh themselves silly at the ever present humour, though the young 'uns will enjoy it more as the references are more recognisable to them.<br />The regular Discworld characters do not make an appearance (Death has a cameo, though) but again that does not affect the story for veteran Disc fans...although events that happened in other Disc books are hinted at, which is nice. Besides, this is an &quot;Amazing Maurice&quot; novel, so let the cat and his rats shine.<br />TP has parodied Shakespeare's plays, Hollywood, politics, murder mysteries and err...Australia in his previous works and this time its the turn of the Brothers Grimm 'Pied Piper' fairy tale. Maurice the cat runs a very profitable scam involving the rodents and a naive kid who can play a pipe but this being a Discworld book, things soon go pear-shaped real quick. There is evil about and it does not like cats. <br />All in all, TP has once again created lovable characters to populate the Discworld and join the ranks of fan favourites like DEATH, the Patrician, Granny Weatherwax, Commander Vimes and the Librarian (oook!). I hope there will be other books featuring Maurice and/or the rats in either the regular Discworld books or this &quot;Young Readers&quot; set. <br />My only criticism is the cover. Why oh why do the Discworld novels published in the US cant have great cover art like its UK counterpart??? This novel suffers the same fate as theregular Disc novels published in the US -- boring covers. Go to amazon.co.uk to see what I mean.	2001-11-13

A lot of souls out there waiting to be processed, y'know?<br />Easy. Get an apprentice. Experience not important. Horse, scythe and all the curry you'll ever need.<br />But dont get too involved with your...eer..'clients'. Thats what Mort did, though. Saved someone who was supposed to die just because he thinks she's cute. But the world doesnt like that. When a person who's supposed to die is still walking around, things begin to turn pear-shaped.<br />So DEATH (no, Im not shouting) needs to sort things out. But where is he? He joined a conga line and is having a jolly time.<br />This is where the Discworld books start to become laugh out loud funny. The first three books was okay but 'Mort' is the book where Pratchett finally found his funny bone and infects everyone with the laughing disease.<br />Those who have yet to start the fun ride through the Discworld and the great city of Ankh Morpork should start their journey here. <br />Enjoy.	2001-09-07
US	48002221	R3JPD7WZN1RJJ3	0061020702	727722067	The Light Fantastic	Books	3	9	10	N	N	Its okay if you give it a miss...	Picks up where 'Colour of Magic' left off. Rincewind and Twoflower is thrown from one problem to another with a quick solution always close at hand to help them.<br />Actually, you should only read 'Colour of Magic' and 'Light Fantastic' if you are a completist. Otherwise, I recommend readers new to the Discworld to start with the 3rd book featuring the Witches or better yet the 4th book featuring DEATH. <br />'Light Fantastic' isnt bad. In fact I think its slightly better than the first book. But like I said you wont miss anything much if you dont read them and jump straight to 'Equal Rites' or 'Mort'.  <br />Rincewind, despite starring in a few other Discworld novels, has never quite reached the popularity of other Discworld regulars like the City Watch, Granny Weatherwax or DEATH. I dont know why but I think Rincewind just doesnt have that much pizzazz as a character. <br />Still, not a bad read.	2001-09-07

The book that gave birth to the craze.<br />Those who have read the other Discworld books first before reading 'Colour of Magic' may find this book not as funny and the writing not as smooth. That is to be understood. It is the first book after all. <br />Well known characters may also seem different. Death is potrayed as Death should be; dark and sinister. It is a contrast from his later appearances, especially in his own books 'Mort' and 'Reaper Man', where he (it?) is more...well, funnier. Other Discworld regulars also make their first appearances here such as the Patrician and the City Watch officers. Oh, the famous Mended Drum (Ankh Morpork's hippest hangout) is featured as well in the early part of the book...but something happens to it.<br />In fact, something happens to at least half the city. It catches fire. Then it floods. The inept wizard Rincewind swears its not his fault. Nor is it Twoflower's. It just so happens that trouble is attracted to them like pubescent boys are to Britney Spears.<br />Rincewind is a failed wizard with only one spell in his head. A spell so powerful other spells run away. Twoflower is a tourist from a faraway land who wants to see the fabled city of Ankh Morpork. Rincewind has to look after him and make sure he's not hurt by order of the Patrician...or else. Of course this being Rincewind and the world being the Disc, a nice leisurely stroll through the sights and sounds of Ankh Morpock are well nigh impossible. Its more like a gallop. <br />'Colour of Magic' reads like a typical fantasy novel like 'The Hobbit' albeit with more jokes. The reader is roller-coastered from one mishap to the next with a permanent grin on his/her face.<br />And that's all your face will probably make. A grin. Not a chuckle. Nor a guffaw. Read the other Discworld books if you want to laugh out loud. Especially the ones that feature Death or the City Watch. Saying that though, 'Colourof Magic' is still a good book from the fertile mind of Terry Pratchett. After all, if it wasnt good enough there wouldn't be a Discworld series.<br />3 stars.	2001-09-02
US	48002221	R7T43OQXC637B	0812550706	401439625	Ender's Game (The Ender Quintet)	Books	5	1	1	N	N	Politics, brutality, manipulation, war...and he's only a kid	The world has survived 2 alien bug invasions and the International Fleet will be damned if they are going to wait for the third one to arrive. So they seek out the brightest kids they can find, put them in a military school in space and pick the best kid to command Earth's fleet. Ender is his name.<br />There isnt any hard sf theories in this novel. In fact most of the space battles take place in the training room in the form of mock battles between kids. So if you want to read about sci-fi a la Asimov, Clarke or Hamilton you'll be disappointed. In fact if it wasnt for the alien bugs or the school in space, this should not be classified as sci-fi at all. <br />I picked up this book because I was bored and I'm glad I did!! Simple premise yet damn entertaining.<br />An excellent story about the inherent good and evil in all of us. Read Ender's Shadow immediately after this one. Its not a sequel but more of a parallel novel which is equally good. Read it while 'Game' is still fresh in your mind.	2001-08-23

Ender's Shadow is like &quot;Rosencrantz and Guilderstein are Dead&quot; to Game's &quot;Hamlet&quot;.<br />The plot also shifts from Bean in space to Sister Carlotta on earth, a nun who 'discovered' him for the I.F. and wants to know Bean's origin. I wont reveal anything here except to say...this kid is different, different even from the other prodigies in the school.<br />Another great book from Orson Scott Card.	2001-08-23

Its a pity, in my opinion, that he failed to instill the same sense of wonder and adventure in his other series including the sequel to the Belgariad -- The Mallorean Saga.<br />Enjoy the epic that is The Belgariad. Dont bother about Eddings' other works (Mallorean, Tamuli etc etc). They are not as good.	2001-08-20

After that I just jumped to the last 2 chapters to see what happened, but I really didnt care anymore.<br />I read Bradbury's &quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot; years ago and loved it. When this book was touted to be similiar to 'Fahrenheit', I expected another interesting romp. Boy, was I wrong.<br />The only saving grace was its alternate chapters where we can read of the early days of the anti-old art movement (which is why I give this book 2 stars instead of 1). But even that didnt hold my attention long.<br />If I can only use one word to describe the book, it would be:- BORING.	2001-06-22
