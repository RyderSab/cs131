The most striking personality must be that of the most infamous of the 19, the Egyptian Mohamed Mohamed el-Amir Awad el-Sayed Atta, who piloted the jet into the North Tower. His hate-filled eyes stare out from the cover of \\"Perfect Soldiers\\" in a sickly greenish light. In addition to the hate, there is absolute determination. It is the stare of someone who will get what he wants, or die trying, or both. There can be no doubt that it was his monomania and discipline more than any other factor that brought the scheme off. <br /> <br />His public life as a student and employee would not suggest a murderer. He was diligent and persistent and intelligent, a competent student who respected his teachers, a valued and reliable employee at an urban planning firm, who prayed at break time. On the other hand, McDermott's research into his personal life in Germany reveals just the sort of fanatic one would expect: a young man unwilling to make eye contact with women, a roommate who never cleans up the kitchen, a martinet who seethed at the disorganized chatter in a movie house before the feature started. One thinks of Hitler or Lenin: humorless, uptight, permanently fixed on the objective. When one of his friends asks him why he never laughs, he answers, \\"How can you laugh when people are dying in Palestine?\\"  <br /> <br />The other hijacker whose story fascinates is the one who piloted the plane that went down in Pennsylvania. He is shown with his wife in the photograph section of the book. As much as Atta looks the part, so Ziad Jarrah looks impossible for the part. His wife is lovely, they are holding hands, and instead of the steely stare of the zealot, Jarrah has the easy smile of a happy, affluent, handsome student, which in fact he was. He came from a middle class Beirut family that lived just a couple blocks from the site of the Sabra Massacre. Within a year of his arrival in Germany he had fallen in love with the woman who would become his wife, a Turkish dentistry student. He had also begun to transform himself into a terrorist. <br /> <br />\\"Perfect Soldiers\\" is many stories of many plotters, all with links to al Qaida, all circling back in some way to 9/11. Reading them, I frequently got the feeling that prior to 9/11 the most powerful nation in the world was protecting its own shores with all the wariness of Little Red Riding Hood. In tracing the steps of Ramzi Yousef, the first World Trade Center bomber, McDermott describes his arrival at Kennedy Airport, \\"dressed like a peacock...in a bright orange, brown, and olive green three-piece silk ensemble with flowing sleeves and ballooning harem pants\\" and no visa.  <br /> <br />\\"He was given a choice of being deported or arrested. He chose arrest and was immediately freed on his own recognizance, walked out of the airport and took a taxi to Brooklyn.\\" <br /> <br />What on earth is the meaning of that? That he was freed with the understanding that he would come back to the authorities about getting a visa when he had more time? Just because the guy who came in on the flight with him had \\"military manuals, jihad magazines, recipes for chemical explosives, and more false IDs\\" in his baggage, does that mean that he, Ramzi Yousef, should be kept overlong at the immigration turnstile? Apparently not. After all, he had important business in Brooklyn. <br /> <br />Similarly, Zacarias Moussaoui, the loony would-be hijacker who expressed an interest to a flight school in being taught to \\"fly in a `professional' like manners (sic) one of the big airliners...Boeing 747, 757,767, or 777 and or Airbus 300 ...The level I would like to achieve is to be able to takeoff and land\\", was identified by the flight school and the FBI as a likely terrorist and arrested on August 14, 2001. The FBI was denied permission to search his computer, which, it was revealed the following September, had a good deal of information about bin Laden and Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and the Hamburg cell, possibly enough to have foiled the plot. <br /> <br />All in all, a masterful work, seeming more drama than journalism. McDermott plays only one false note as far as I could tell. That is in describing the squadron of grunt soldiers who came from Saudi Arabia to help the pilots: <br /> <br />\\"The Saudi economy had simply not produced worthwhile jobs for the growing ranks of Saudi young adults...they were set adrift. With nowhere to go economically, they went where they were called by their religion.\\" <br /> <br />Nonsense. All the hijackers had enough economic resources to get visas to the US at a time when visas were denied if the State Department suspected the applicant were an \\"economic migrant\\". They had plenty of places to go economically. They chose to go into terrorism for other reasons. In an otherwise cogent discussion of 9/11, the author falls into the talking head delusion that the attacks were due to anything-joblessness, lack of freedom, misunderstanding--anything but what their perpetrators said they were: retaliation for attacks on Muslims, chiefly Palestinian Muslims. The giant atrocity on 9/11 was vengeance for the 60-year string of lesser atrocities inflicted on the Palestinians by the Israelis and their allies, the Americans. The collapse of the towers was a not-so-distant echo of the collapse of the King David Hotel in 1946. <br />	2005-09-28

Beginning with the Subaru Outback mentioned on page xvi., and proceeding through the yacht on page 147, and the proceeds from sale of Main stock on page 165, and the \\"spectacular retainer\\" from Stone and Webster Engineering Corp. on page 171, and the \\"lucrative deal\\" causing obscene windfall profits from the sale of Independent Power Systems on page 185, and all retirement plans and benefit packages from Main, and finally, all royalties and speaking fees stemming from this fabulous Amazon bestseller----all must be liquidated and put into a fund that will provide the indigenous people of Ecuador with solar panels, lifetime subscriptions to Mother Jones, Kerry bumperstickers, yachts, free Middlebury tuition, and unlimited blow dart replacements.  <br /> <br />Consider yourself lucky, John, that your atonement does not include prison time. It should, considering you knew about and did nothing to prevent, and in fact substantially abetted, the following: <br />1) Rape of the Amazon rain forest (p. 124) <br />2) Iranian revolution and hostage crisis (p.118) <br />3) Assassination of Omar Torrijos by the CIA (pp. 158-61) <br />4) The rise of Osama bin Laden (p. 81-98) <br /> <br />You can no longer conceal these crimes from the world, John, for they found their way into your book. Your professions of guilt and self-loathing are not enough. For full atonement on #1 above,  you must go to the cacique of the Quechua and wash his feet with your tears, then dry them with your hair. Repeat this process on several Shiite mullahs for #2.  For # 3, go to the north bank of the Panama Canal and shoot a live webcast with you proclaiming the names of those responsible (we know you know, for you are an insider of long standing). And for #4, you must of course, find Osama bin Laden and bring him to justice, as you have brought to justice by your courageous outspokenness George Schultz, Caspar Weinberger, and all the others in the Bechtel cabal.  <br /> <br />Do these things, John, and the world will be lenient. Neglect to do them, and the world will know you as something akin to OJ Simpson vowing to find the murderer of his wife--not so much an economic hit man as an egomaniac blowhard. <br />	2005-09-06

When I first picked it up in 1982 I flew through it in a few days. Recently I obtained the audio edition and began listening to the 43 tapes. It has lost exactly none of its engrossing qualities. Whatever one may think about his megalomania, it's impossible not to get caught up in the sweep of time and change that his life embodied. Born in 1888 when horse and buggy ruled the road, he was responsible more than anyone else in the world for the car-and-truck dominated society we now inhabit. Starting out as a nave idealist, he evolved into the diametrical opposite of that: a callous, all-powerful autocrat growing like a malignant tumor in the heart of a free society. In the twenties he struggles against the owners of vast estates to open up the beaches and open space of Long Island to the urban poor. By the fifties he is ramming eight lane highways down the middle of the neighborhoods of the urban poor, condemning scores of buildings at a stroke and displacing hundreds of families, and destroying the day-to-day lives of those who remain next to the likes of the Cross Bronx Expressway and the BQE.  <br /> <br />One can speculate that the problem was that he was unelected and therefore immune to checks and balances, much like J. Edgar Hoover. But then, Robert Caro's other subject, Lyndon Johnson, did perhaps ten times the damage that Moses did, and he was elected repeatedly. It all makes for great reading-or listening if you happen to be caught in traffic. <br />	2005-08-07

This could mean only one thing: the once-remaindered guide had stood the test of time and become a classic, coveted by collectors. <br /> <br />As I thumbed through the text in preparation for a trip from Nogales down to Hermosillo and Guaymas, it didn't take long to see why. Joe Cummings is several cuts above the typical travel writer. In addition to the usual thumbnail sketches of hotels and restaurants, there were sidebars on the curious plants and animals of the region, one page glossaries on branches of cuisine such as antojitos and agave liquor, and, to me most fascinating, short profiles of various aboriginal cultures that have been in Northern Mexico for centuries-the Seris, the Tarahumaras, the Huicholes, and even a group of Kickapoo who left Wisconsin in 1775 when they saw the neighborhood was going downhill, and who've lived in Coahuila ever since. <br /> <br />The pictures, small as they are, are superb. There are accurate maps of the entire region and of every state, and of all but the smallest of towns, and of the centers of cities. The first 132 pages are jammed with every sort of useful general information one can think of, from a short history of the area, to a discussion of the food, to tips on shopping, to a list of Mexican consulates on this side of the border. And, once you are in the state by state travel section of the book, those thumbnail sketches of hotels and restaurants cover a great many establishments, with the emphasis on the more economical ones, but occasionally straying into luxury. <br /> <br />The book winds up, as any good reference volume does, with a series of lists: airlines serving Northern Mexico, railway schedules, a Spanish glossary, and a thorough bibliography, where I saw two books that I'd read previously but which I never dreamed I'd see on the same page: A translation of Alvar Nunez Cabeza de Vaca's \\"Naufragios\\" and Suzy Gershman's \\"Born to Shop Mexico\\", which really shows how far the region has come since the 1530s. <br />	2005-08-05

Stephens publishes his first book on the Maya and it is hailed by Edgar Allen Poe, among others, as \\"perhaps the most interesting book of travel ever published\\". His second book on the Maya, the one for sale on this page, was called \\"better than its brother\\" by William Hickling Prescott. 153 years slip by, and a new edition of \\"Incidents of Travel in Yucatan\\" is published by none other than Smithsonian Books.<br /><br />I made the mistake of assuming the new edition, coming from Smithsonian Books, would be of high quality. How wrong I was.<br /><br />Mr. Ackerman, in his own words, has reduced the text of this classic \\"by two thirds, but aims to preserve the spirit and essence of the original work\\". That's right, this \\"editor\\" cuts out 67% of one of the greatest works of literature in history, and has the impudence and effrontery to say he aims to preserve the book's spirit and essence. Then, taking the concept of hubris to a new level, he puts his name on the cover under that of the author--as though he had actually added something.<br /><br />He has added nothing, only subtracted. Besides the 67% of the text, he also removed the name of Frederick Catherwood, who did the marvelous drawings, from the cover.<br /><br />In the introduction, there is not the slightest hint of shame for the gut job, which he describes: \\"I have eliminated Stephens' description of the journeys to and from the region...I have tightened Stephens' prose, eliminated the detailed measurements of buildings and mounds, and excised long historical digressions and anecdotes...I have not used ellipses to indicate compression...\\"<br /><br />With all the eliminations and excisions and hackings, Ackerman elects to leave in place misspellings because they \\"reveal Stephens' character and time\\". Let me get this straight. Historical digressions and anecdotes, admired by the likes of Poe and Prescott, must be cut. But misspellings must be preserved to reveal character and time? What sort of a wacky caricature of a scholar did the Smithsonian Scholarly Book Fund give a grant to?<br /><br />I have tried to fathom why a person with an interest in archaeology and history and literature would maim a book in this fashion, but I'm at a loss. One would expect this sort of thing if Spielberg were making a biopic about Stephens. Then, the cuts would be necessary to fit the story into a 90-minute slot while keeping enough space for a sassy love interest and a talking jaguar. But this is a fantastic book that eight generations of readers from around the world have loved in its entirety.<br /><br />Where is the Dover edition?	2005-05-04
US	52767766	R31FJ9A3ZVA4JG	0060934816	903452926	Shanghai : The Rise and Fall of a Decadent City 1842-1949	Books	4	7	8	N	N	Casablanca on the Yangste	\\"Shanghai\\", the book, is a good history of one of the world's great crossroads. Stella Dong follows the fortunes of Shanghai for 107 years and enlivens the chronicle with hundreds of its colorful and sometimes truly unsavory denizens. From its main formative event, the Opium War of 1839-42, to the closing of an era with the takeover of the communists in 1949, Shanghai was filled and refilled with sharpers and refugees from around the globe. <br /> <br />The Opium War, less a war than a program of intimidation conducted by the British to protect the \\"right\\" of Scottish magnates and Iraqi Jews and others to sell opium in Chinese ports, led to a treaty in 1842 which provided for the establishment of a foreign section in Shanghai. Here, the British and other nationalities could operate without being subject to the laws of China. <br /> <br />So, like Hong Kong, the foreign section became a piece of Europe grafted onto China. The British, then the Americans and the French, operated what amounted to microcolonies almost completely devoted to commerce. The opium trade was foremost, followed by cotton, but the trade in human beings was also big in Shanghai, so much so that the very name of the city was given to the practice of abducting Chinese. American, British, and French companies kidnapped or \\"Shanghaied\\" Chinese men and took them away in ships resembling slave ships to work in mines and plantations in the Americas under conditions very similar to slavery.  <br /> <br />Christian missionaries, who had operated in China for centuries, now had more clout and a safe base of operations from which to wield it. They started drives to abolish prostitution and foot-binding, the latter being a thousand-year-old practice peculiar to the Chinese.  They were successful, according to Dong, in eradicating foot-binding in a relatively short period of time (30 years). I had heard of foot-binding before, and I knew that at some point it had stopped, but before reading this book I didn't know that missionaries had started the drive to abolish it. If true, it certainly counterbalances some of the less humane things the missionaries are known for. <br /> <br />The Japanese showed up in Shanghai in 1894 after winning a war with China, and demanded the same sort of privileges as the Europeans and Americans. Not content with just a part of Shanghai, however, they would shortly return for all of it. In the mean time, the Bolsheviks triumphed in Russia, and White Russian refugees flooded into Shanghai from Vladivostok to the north. Dong notes that this was a type of European the Shanghainese had not seen before: destitute and desperate. Yet just as they blended into the other cities of the Russian exodus such as Berlin and New York, the Russians were soon an integral part of Shanghai, thriving chiefly in the various realms of nightlife: cabarets, tearooms, restaurants, dance halls... <br /> <br />By 1920 all the elements were assembled for a scene as glamorous and decadent as any the world has seen, and it played out in Shanghai against the backdrop of one of the world's oldest monarchies changing into a republic. Like all great parties, however, it lasted but a moment. The Japanese came and shut things down in 1937. After they were defeated, the Shanghainese had only four short years to recover before the Chinese Communists came and put an end to any sort of foreign influence that remained.  <br /> <br />Dong keeps strictly to 1949 as her endpoint, and one can't fault her for that. Still, it would be very interesting to know the fate of all the capitalist enterprises that thrived in the city. Is there any connection at all, for example, between any of the old merchant houses and the burgeoning Chinese communist/capitalists who work there now? After all, there was only about 30 years from 1949 to the time that Deng proclaimed \\"to get rich is glorious\\". Perhaps more than just the buildings on the Bund survive. <br />	2005-04-26

Not as dramatic as the California gold rush or the Civil War, it is all the same a remarkable moment in time when people poured into the largely uninhabited interior of the continent and started a new society. M.H. Dunlop draws on dozens of travel journals to make a portrait that is unusually rich and textured.<br /><br />Comparing the old journals to modern tourist lit, she finds attitudes and outlooks that have survived to the present day, such as the wishful thinking for an idyllic landscape with waterfalls and scenic overlooks. Just as early travelers such as Charles Dickens and Frances Trollope found the vast unquaint landscape dispiriting and comfortless, so too are modern brochures reluctant to speak of the millions of square miles devoted to industrial agriculture. Instead, they tout a Victorian ideal of gingerbread cottages and food festivals completely separated from the production and producers of the food. If one set out today to see the Midwest in a car armed with tourist brochures, the culture shock would be similar to that suffered by 19th century Europeans who set out on a trip along the Ohio River expecting something similar to the valley of the Loire.<br /><br />I found the plentiful and pithy quotations of the early inhabitants to be especially evocative of the period. In describing how outsiders could not comprehend the settlers' passion for clear-cutting the landscape, Dunlop quotes a local who in turn could not understand some more recent settlers' decision to leave a few oak trees standing around their house: \\"Well! I should think there was oak trees enough without keeping `em in a body's dooryard!\\"  Stage passengers who were asked by Trollope why they didn't complain directly to an innkeeper about food so bad that among themselves they said it amounted to \\"poisoning folks\\", replied that they did not complain because innkeepers couldn't \\"bear to be found fault with\\".<br /><br />The exploration of the eating habits of the early inhabitants forms an especially fascinating chapter: \\"A Table Set For Hundreds\\". Many travelers reported on the phenomenon wherein a dinner bell would ring in a steamship or hotel and the guests would surge to the table and wordlessly demolish huge amounts of food in a matter of ten or fifteen minutes, then just as quickly retreat from the dining area to wait for the next ringing of the bell. The American folkways puzzled foreigners much, but probably not as much as they would a 21st century American transported back to that time and place. What, for example, would today's medical professional make of the plague of tobacco spit, which was ubiquitous? \\"Streets, walkways, boat decks, the floors of trains and hotel lobbies, all were described by travelers as coated with brown slime. Frances Trollope claimed it to be impossible for women to protect their dresses from it...\\" And what would today's riverboat gambler think of the rigid separation of the sexes on riverboats of that time, seemingly more in keeping with a fundamentalist morality than with a desire to provide comfortable transport?<br /><br />\\"Sixty Miles\\" is occasionally marred by feminism and class warfare--a sort of retroactive resentment over women having had to do housekeeping 175 years ago while the men were out chopping trees and slaughtering hogs. This can probably be ascribed to the author's milieu, which is academe, where history is generally not acceptable unless it contains feminist or Marxist \\"analysis\\". But overall the book is very readable and quite witty, and not at all typical of histories written by academics.eepers couldn't \\"bear to be found fault with\\". <br /> <br />The exploration of the eating habits of the early inhabitants forms an especially fascinating chapter: \\"A Table Set For Hundreds\\".

It profiles 50 wildflowers and makes mention of the locale of dozens more in the course of the text on the 50 hikes. In this way, one can make flower identification moving from the book to the trail or the other way around. The photos, over 100 in all, are of very high quality. <br /> <br />The author, Christine Maxa, is well-informed and concise. By the time you've read through a few of the hikes and profiles, you realize she's every bit as at ease with wildlife as her portrait with an elephant would imply. She shows not only a familiarity with the flowers, but also a wide knowledge of the pollinators and predators and parasites that dwell among them: the cochineal insect, source of the rich red dye prized for centuries by aboriginal Americans and Europeans alike; hummingbirds, which carry pollen on their heads; bees, which carry it on every part of their bodies; forest rangers, which carry the full force of the federal government when charging the spectacular parking fees described in the \\"Special Considerations\\" section of the hiking guides.  <br /> <br />One of the nice things about learning about desert flowers is that there are relatively few of them, so that one can become well-versed and appear authoritative in a relatively short time. Even so, surprises abound. American carrot, which appears on many of the hikes, is a real carrot of the genus Daucus, though Maxa does not say whether the root is edible. Scorpion weed and rattlesnake weed, despite their ominous names, are benign and pretty, while larkspur, a beautiful type of delphinium, is highly poisonous. <br /> <br />This guide's greatest strength, fittingly enough, is its information. I had wondered in the past whether teddy bear cholla and jumping cholla were one and the same plant. A quick trip to the handy 2-page index of common and scientific names confirmed that it was. This sort of detail may seem simple, but it's often surprisingly hard to come by, given the widespread fear among Americans of Latin binomial nomenclature. And despite the title's reference to Arizona desert, the flowers discussed are by no means restricted to that state. Eleven years ago in the California part of Death Valley I noticed a widespread infestation of a parasite that resembled a tangle of orange string. Thanks to this book I finally know what it was: Dodder (p.134), a plant related to morning glory that lacks leaves and roots and chlorophyll. Of further  interest in the profile are two common names for dodder that at first glance seem to describe mutually exclusive traits: love vine and strangleweed. <br />	2005-03-24
US	52767766	R21WVDPDDN7E8C	0345472519	234078777	Stalking the Vietcong: Inside Operation Phoenix: A Personal Account	Books	5	53	59	N	N	The Right Way To Do It	Part memoir, part case study, part entertainment, \\"Stalking the Vietcong\\" is the most incisive look at the Vietnam War and the Vietnamese that I have seen. As an army intelligence officer, Stuart Herrington spent 20 months in the Hau Nghia province near Saigon plumbing  assorted Vietcong defectors and POWs for information, and passing it on to the South Vietnamese military to act upon. Initially he is reluctant to go to Vietnam, being somewhat dovish and skeptical on the war. But by the end of the 20 months he has become so engrossed in his mission and so taken by Vietnamese culture that the only way to make him leave is a direct order from higher-ups at the Pentagon. It's evident that he, for one, came to believe strongly in the goal of preventing the second half of the Vietnamese people from being subjugated. <br /> <br />Herrington shows in his narrative not only what he was doing to eradicate the Vietcong, but also what the Vietcong were doing to make themselves need eradicating. The insidious spread of their \\"shadow government\\" meant dirt poor peasants had to pay a rice tax to them in addition to whatever they had to pay to the legitimate government. The young men of the villages and hamlets, if they somehow escaped being drafted into the army of South Vietnam, would be subject to conscription into the guerilla forces operating in the area. It is this shadow government that Herrington attacks, acting, as far as I can tell, in the mode of a classic spymaster in his utilization of defectors.  <br /> <br />Though they are all poor, Herrington's informants do not rally to the government side for money, as in many other Cold War spy contests. Instead, they want a way out of the communist war machine which calls on them to spend years on end away from their families in swamps and jungles, fighting endlessly to \\"liberate\\" fellow Vietnamese who don't particularly want to be liberated. The overall impression I take from the half dozen cases discussed is of a peasantry,north and south, being forced to serve as cannon fodder for a dispute raging in the capitals of Russia and America and China and France. They are a people profoundly war weary who more than anything else just want to be left alone. <br /> <br />The attention to colorful  and amusing detail is not something one would expect from an account written by an army intelligence operative, and some is unforgettable, like the North Vietnamese POW kicking \\"off his Ho Chi Minh sandals and squatting barefoot on the (American) general's couch. I barked at him in Vietnamese to get his feet off the furniture...\\". Equally memorable is the account of the feast of \\"Dog Cooked Seven Ways\\" where Herrington, striving as always to respect local customs, plows his way \\"through dog fondue, dog spareribs, and canine cutlets...\\" The seventh and most nutritious course is probably not suitable to discuss on a page that may be read by college town vegetarians. Suffice it to say that it brings to mind another ancient civilization, that of the Chinese, where the cuisine blends aboriginal delicacies with highly refined culinary methods. <br /> <br />Herrington's enthusiastic consumption of the feast served to show his Vietnamese friends that not every American conforms to the stereotype, widely held among Asians, that Americans love their dogs more than their wives. But it also highlights the lengths to which he would go to understand the Vietnamese and thereby better accomplish his mission. It's a pity Kennedy and Johnson didn't first send a few \\"advisors\\" like him to check things out before committing tens of thousands of infantry \\"advisors\\". As well, today's military intelligence people could benefit by the reading of this account, particularly Herrington's emphasis on obtaining information from traumatized survivors through small kindnesses and soothing talk rather than abuse and brutal incarceration. <br /> <br />   <br />	2005-02-08

In the former, a victim of corporate wrongdoing is compensated, either through a verdict after a trial or an out-of-court settlement. In the latter, fast buck operators who've passed the bar exam contact thousands of victims promising a settlement to them if they will join their plaintiff class. They then come to a settlement with the offending company, take out  a huge cut for themselves, and split up the paltry remains among their thousands of \\"clients\\". The focus is not justice or law or compassion, but fast profit, almost as if the class of victims were a block of stock options to be exercised at the most opportune moment. <br /> <br />Clay Carter, Grisham's protagonist, never takes a case to trial, seldom even sees the inside of a courtroom. Instead, his resources are poured into advertising for victims to enlarge his plaintiff classes, and into the trappings of wealth to show his prospective clients that he has pulled off big scores in the past. After they sign with him, his client/victims get a couple of phone calls, a perfunctory medical exam, and a few months later, a check that is woefully low in light of what they have suffered. <br /> <br />The companies that are the targets of Carter's assaults are crippled financially, sometimes driven into backruptcy, throwing thousands out of work. In one case this results in some painful retaliation on Carter, which is satisfying enough to the casual reader. But to those who read this to gain a greater understanding of the diseased tort law system, the ray of hope seems to be personified in the lawyer who steps in toward the end of the story to form a plaintiff class of Carter's dead or dying former clients. A plan is formed to sue him for a crime that seems to be all too rarely prosecuted: legal malpractice. <br /> <br />Not being a lawyer, I can't tell how realistic the circumstancesunderpinning this tale are. The dollar amounts seem high, but then the normal fee for a normal lawyer seems high to me. If Grisham's hyperbole in \\"King of Torts\\" is only minor, then he has done the public a service in illuminating a serious public problem.	2005-02-02
US	52767766	R3PWFNS0BPAQT9	0316821152	561092916	Special Tasks	Books	5	5	7	N	N	View From the Kremlin	More than any other work I've seen, Special Tasks illuminates the Soviet experience. Its author lived it from beginning to end, joining the Red Army in 1919 at the age of 12 and offering his opinion 7 decades later on what Gorbachev did wrong in his attempts to keep the Soviet Union together. <br /> <br />During those 70 years Sudoplatov is at or close to the very center of all the Soviet leadership was known for. He lived through the purges of the Thirties, directed the assassins of Trotsky, played a major role in the defeat of the Nazis, coordinated the theft of atomic secrets from the US, was arrested and imprisoned and tortured, then spent another 20 years in a sort of twilight struggle for rehabilitation, which was finally granted him just days after the dissolution of the Soviet Union. The breadth of this memoir is truly astounding. And while at times it becomes difficult to read due to his tendency to digress into details about persons most readers would not know the significance of, the details about well-known persons and events keep one reading past the digressions: Oppenheimer and Fermi feeding atomic secrets to the Russians in the altruistic belief that a balance of power was preferable to an American monopoly (one thinks of the recent Pakistani scientist who spread nuclear knowledge around for the same reason); Ramon Mercador killing Trotsky with an ice ax while his mother waited in a car outside; then giving all the details of the assassination to Sudoplatov in person in 1969--thirty years later--when they'd both done many, many hard years in prison: the control of emigre scientists in America such as George Gamow through threats to their families in Russia... <br /> <br />Sudoplatov makes no apologies nor seems to have any regrets about what he and Stalin and the others did. He states plainly in the Prologue: \\"We did not believe there was any moral question involved in killing Trotsky or any other of our former comrades who had turned against us. We believed we were in a life and death struggle for the salvation of our grand experiment...\\" <br /> <br />So we are left to wonder whether Sudoplatov, who seems to be a basically decent person playing rough in the service of his country really believes that 10-15 million of his former comrades had really turned against communism and  deserved to die for the \\"salvation\\" of the \\"grand experiment\\". Are we to believe that he believes all of Stalin's purges were justified and Kruschev's were not?  <br /> <br />Like Albert Speer, Sudoplatov is more than a little reticent about the mass murders he was a witness to. A Ukranian by birth, he says nothing about the millions of Ukranians who died during Stalin's collectivization and subjugation of that country, though he worked in Ukraine for the Party through the Twenties, when those horrors took place. There is not the slightest mention of the famines or the shipping off of entire Ukranian villages to death camps. <br /> <br />In a way, one can't blame him. There is a limit to the amount of such things a person can deal with. He was very young and no doubt counted himself lucky to have escaped it. Still, one would like to know what he thinks about it now.	2004-12-13
US	52767766	R2STIIW63MY37E	0060936975	378058051	How I Accidentally Joined the Vast Right-Wing Conspiracy	Books	4	5	10	N	N	Zeal of the Convert	Harry Stein's tale is an amusing one of a junior communist and facile liberal's journey to thinking, critical citizen. Its biggest flaw is the carryover of some of that facile uncritical thinking, namely, replacing knee-jerk blame America first tendencies with knee-jerk glorify America tendencies, coupled with the French bashing that has become so fashionable of late. <br /> <br />This is on display most prominently on page 162 in the paragraph that ends with the name Clinton. Stein lashes the French and Clinton simultaneously, holding up Washington and Jefferson in stark contrast to the Debauched Ones. Our America, he crows, \\"routinely (gives) rise to figures of towering character\\" while France has \\"invariably produced midgets\\". <br /> <br />Well hold on just a moment. If we're speaking of morals, I don't think we can overlook the slaves. It would seem to be immoral to own a single one. In David McCullough's book on Adams he notes that Washington and Jefferson owned over 200 slaves each. And I wouldn't go for that amber tinted fiction that the Founding Fathers' slaves were treated so well that they weren't even unhappy about being slaves. GW could not tell a lie about a cherry tree, but could he tell a young black girl she could not go to school, nor play with dolls, nor marry the man of her choice, nor even leave his plantation in Virginia? Apparently so, times 200. Or perhaps he delegated the authority to his overseers to convey those messages, along with all the other messages used to control slaves: body parts cut off runaways; forced breeding; parents separated from young children... <br /> <br />A child born on the 4th of July, 1776 on Jefferson's plantation might have lived to be 85 and still have no liberty. That child would have to live over 185 years in Virginia before being granted the right to pursue happiness on an equal footing with other Americans. For two centuries, towering character after towering character was unable to bring the US even with France in the treatment of people of African descent. In the 1950s many of the jazz greats preferred to live among France's moral \\"midgets\\" because they treated them as artist of great talent, as opposed to Virginia, where they were just \\"coloreds\\", not even fit to use the same drinking fountain as the towering descendents of the towering characters. <br /> <br />As Stein heaps scorn on the French for the collapse in 1940 he fails to consider the protective effects of thousands of miles of ocean between America and Nazi Germany. When he touts the American War of Independence he forgets the French naval blockade of Cornwallis at Yorktown, which more than any other factor won the war. <br /> <br />As for Stein's absurd suggestion that the French Resistance was a myth--that's on a par with suggesting the Underground Railroad was a myth, historical amnesia at best, desecration of fallen heroes at worst. <br /> <br />Stein is better when relating the folly of his former fellow travellers and what they've evolved (is that the right word?) into: animal rights activists demanding (and being granted!)authority to guard against the abuse of cockroaches on a Barry Sonnenfeld movie set. One wonders whether such lunacy is a harbinger of worse things to come, or just a relic of the madness that began to be rolled back at the dawn of the Reagan era, when Stein's transformation began.	2004-11-22
US	52767766	R1RLY3OE0JJYAM	0793144914	961102119	Flipping Properties: Generate Instant Cash Profits in Real Estate	Books	3	52	55	N	N	They Call Him Flipper	Informative book, though slick as a dolphin's back. The biggest drawback, in my view, is that the strategy is based solely on distressed properties--the so-called motivated seller. The authors make this clear from the get-go, defining &quot;distressed property&quot; on page 3, and cautioning the reader throughout the book to deal only with motivated sellers.<br />This approach makes good sense, but it cuts out a world full of wonder: the physically sub-par house in the upscale neighborhood. Sellers in such places are seldom highly motivated, but who can deny that there are profits to be made there? Too, distressed properties are the domain of the giant wholesalers such as Homvesters,Inc., so you have very well financed competition.<br />I read all the way through just to see what the process was like in these sorts of transactions. Title problems in particular interested me since motivated sellers are apt to be up to their eyeballs in liens and judgements. On page 79 I found this information: &quot;Even if the title report shows problems with the title, the contract is still in force if the seller can cure the problems before closing.&quot;<br />And if the seller can't, which is highly probable, since they acquired the problems and signed a contract to sell the house to get out of the problems? Well then the authors have 3 solutions for you, the buyer, and they all start with &quot;Sue&quot;.<br />1. Sue for specific performance<BR>2. Sue for damages<BR>3. Sue for return of the earnest money<br />So unless you're a lawyer, which Bronchick is, you can kiss your prospective profits goodbye just prior to signing and sending a check to the lawyer of your choice. No one you see is smarter than he.<br />Not surprisingly, the authors recommend doing business as a corporation, since we &quot;live in a litigious society...Eighty million lawsuits are filed every year.&quot; Scandalous. In addition, Bronchick and Dahlstrom provide timely and comic advice for keeping your marriage together as you make the transition to flipper: &quot;If you are married, make sure your spouse reads this material with you and participates in the fun process of making money.&quot;	2004-04-04
US	52767766	R1GRFLWZ7ZGLWT	0812966732	633811695	Lazy B: Growing up on a Cattle Ranch in the American Southwest	Books	5	16	16	N	N	Only the B was Lazy	Growing up in a city, I always wondered during car trips through ranchland how the people there lived. Was it a hard life? Lonely? Were they like us in the city?<br />I knew from movies and TV that calves in pastures were grown into large steers through a gradual process of fistfighting and gunslinging, with the cowboys taking frequent breaks to drink whiskey and play poker. But that was only part of the story. What role did the women and children play? Why the windmills? Who provided basic services?<br />All these questions and more have now been answered by a Supreme Court Justice, of all things. Lazy B is Sandra Day O'Connor's memoir of her girlhood on a ranch in the desert Southwest. The simple unaffected style of her writing is just right to convey the power of the story: a family living on a desolate ranch for 113 years--a happy family, a resourceful and persistent family.<br />The Day ranch had already been operating for 50 years when Sandra was born in 1930, and was still going strong when she was appointed to the high court 51 years later. The Days didn't have hot running water until 1937, but when they did it was from a solar heater designed by Sandra's father--40 years ahead of the solar energy craze of the 1970s.<br />That sort of self reliance and innovation is one of the main themes of the book: when they needed more water they built windmills to bring it up out of the ground. When the windmills broke, they fixed them. Before the windmills and solar heater, the limited hot water for bathing was used in sequence: first Sandra's mother, then her father, then the children, then the ranch hands, if they had any interest in the water that remained. Not a cushy life, but several of the cowboys liked it enough to stay at Lazy B for over 50 years.<br />The self-reliance in the area of first aid is even more striking: Sandra's father successfully mending the uterus of a cow with a wine bottle and some stitches; one of the cowhands giving himself a root canal with red hot baling wire, or taping his broken finger to a nail so he could keep working.<br />And while all of them--Mom,Dad,kids,cowhands--did whatever they had to do to keep working, O'Connor's memories are overwhelmingly happy ones of card games and wild animal pets and riding through the desert and, more than anything else, conversations. One gets the impression that no one ever had a better childhood.<br />O'Connor may or may not be a great justice--I don't know much about the law--but it seems to me that she was a part of something great long before she ever got a law degree. A happy family and a solvent ranch are two things which are hard to maintain for more than a dozen years. The Days did it for a dozen plus a year and a century. Looking at the picture on page 257, I see the very bedrock of the country.	2004-03-11
US	52767766	R2M8DMWV4FZ0WW	0142000957	323802732	Killing Pablo: The Hunt for the World's Greatest Outlaw	Books	5	3	3	N	N	First Rate Crime Drama	In reading KILLING PABLO, I was struck by the likeness of Pablo Escobar to later terrrorists such as UBL and Saddam. For example, the Colombian trafficker demands investigation of &quot;human rights abuses&quot; and backs up his demand with a threat to place a 10,000 kg bomb in a Colombian govmnt office. He sends a suicide bomber to blow up an Avianca jet in flight, killing all 110 passengers, then issues more demands: &quot;We want peace...We do not accept the numerous arbitrary raids on our families, the ransacking, the repressive detentions, the judicial frame-ups, the anti-patriotic and illegal extraditions, the violations of all our rights...&quot; To &quot;make a statement to the Colombian government&quot; he orders a captured army officer to be tortured to death slowly.<br />It is a scenario which seems to be becoming ever more common: a thug with endless amounts of money attempting to impose the law of the jungle on the world. It's not wild to speculate that if he hadn't been killed, Pablo Escobar might well have beaten bin Laden to the punch in landing a major attack on US soil.<br />Mark Bowden does a thorough job of giving the political context as well as the intimate details of the hunt for Escobar. The drug lord is shown to be a functioning pothead with delusions of grandeur of remarkable severity, seeing himself as a sort of messianic guerilla, a cross between Che Guevara, Vito Corleone, and Christ. He maunders while stoned that terrorism is &quot;the atomic bomb for poor people&quot;. One doesn't need too lively an imagination to see what he, a person rich enough to buy an atomic bomb, would do with it to help the poor people for whom he cared so deeply.<br />The unreal quality of the saga is brought home most vividly in the chapter on Escobar's &quot;imprisonment&quot;, a bizarre charade in which Escobar carried on his coke business from the confines of a specially built &quot;prison&quot; where his supporters had buried an arsenal of machine guns just in case the incarceration was not to his liking. Here, the &quot;guards&quot; served drinks on the sidelines while the &quot;inmates&quot; played endless games of soccer. After a little over a year Escobar does leave, resuming his former life of fugitive and terrrorist. President Gavira of Colombia makes a fateful resolution: &quot;This was the last time he and the country would be humiliated by Pablo Escobar. There would be no more deals, no more special prisons. Pablo would be hunted down and killed...there was no other way. Pablo was a criminal with not restraints, no boundaries. He could do anything; he WOULD do anything.&quot;<br />It takes one more year to run him to ground, which the Colombians do with the help of the US DEA and a vigilante group called Los Pepes. The manhunt and the methods frequently stray into questionable legal terrain, just as in the searches for Saddam and UBL. But there can be little doubt that it was either Escobar or the Colombian government that would survive, not both. Aside from the fascinating story, KILLING PABLO is an excellent case study of how a crime organization like the Medellin cartel, if left to fester, has the potential to grow into a full dictatorship.	2004-02-27

He notes that &quot;scorekeepers still keep score on boards&quot;. He might also have added that the early scoring was the first expression of binary code, the language understood by the tiny chips that run the giant scoreboards at the Super Bowl, as well as every other scoreboard or &quot;computer&quot; on Earth.<br />Epstein gives here a curious insider/outsider account of the book business over the last half century. He was decidedly inside when he began in the fifties, working with Bennett Cerf and Donald Klopfer to &quot;publish&quot; such legends as Nabokov and Faulkner. His anecdote of Nabokov is a gem. He runs into the author in the bar of the Paris Ritz in the early seventies. Nabokov, in a loud Hawaiian shirt and a loud Midwestern accent, raises a toast to Richard Nixon. Why Nixon? Because he believed Nixon would eventually triumph over the Viet Cong and that would lead, dominolike, to the fall of the Soviet Union, enabling him to return to his beloved homeland.<br />By the eighties Epstein and his ilk are being overwhelmed by mass market forces. Chain bookstores seem to be taking over the industry and reducing drastically the numbers of titles available for sale (and by extension able to be published). The pressure of real estate costs at the malls steadily reduced the selection at bookstores to a handful of bestsellers, &quot;whose faithful readers are addicted to their formulaic melodramas&quot;. Publishers who in Epstein's early years were like intellectual families had by the eighties been reduced to mere distributors and advertisers. Between 1986 and 1996, he relates, &quot;63 of the 100 bestselling titles were written by a mere 6 writers&quot;.<br />By way of hinting at what was to come, Epstein tells of meeting a man who in the 1950s described to Epstein in some detail...the Internet. Epstein liked and respected the man, Norbert Wiener, an engineering prof at MIT, but &quot;dismissed this prophecy as science fiction&quot;. Courageously, Epstein admits his failure to take the prophecy seriously reflected &quot;the limitations of my own worldview at the time and that of my intellectual friends who were increasingly absorbed in Cold War issues and felt that the fate of Western civilization depended upon the positions they took in their articles for Partisan Review or in their dinner party conversation&quot;. One sees the limitations of his worldview pop up again when he meets a man named Bezos, who is committed to changing the book business. After a fairly short time, Epstein pronounces Bezos to be &quot;committed to an incorrect business model&quot;.<br />But in spite of revealing himself to be a bit of a mossback, Epstein also gives what I found to be one of the most exhilerating glimpses anywhere of what technology can do for the book business: A kiosk, containing an &quot;ATM machine for books&quot;. In it, an integrated set of computer, internet connection, laser printer, and binder. You put your money in, type onto a keyboard what text you want--anything from a transcript of the Nixon tapes to a copy of LOLITA to a handbook of Siberian butterflies--and the computer downloads it, the laser prints it, and the binder binds it. It doesn't matter if it's &quot;out of print&quot;. That phrase is obsolescent. It doesn't matter if the book is banned. The newly printed and bound book will fall into a slot like a can of Coke. Your wait will be perhaps 5 minutes in 2005, falling to 5 seconds in 2010.	2004-02-22

It's a desert and we get a lot of oil there. Then a couple years ago people began paying more attention to what Robert Baer and a few others in the various spy agencies had been saying about Saudi Arabia for many years: no oil is cheap enough to be a good trade-off for what's cooking over there. Cheap oil isn't worth allowing an &quot;ally&quot; to keep half it population (the female half) in the equivalent of apartheid. Cheap oil isn't worth allowing an &quot;ally&quot; to nurture terrorist organizations on its own soil and to send money to them elsewhere. It's not even worth it when the Saudis reciprocate by buying huge amounts of military hardware and commercial aircraft from US companies. There's got to be a change, and Baer tells why.<br />The fact that a book like this is published, albeit with various names blacked out, suggests the wheels are beginning to turn on the Saudi problem, which in many ways is linked to the terrorism problem. Baer follows the by-now familiar path leading from 15 Saudi 9/11 thugs: Al Qaida, an offshoot of the Muslim Brotherhood, which is hosted and protected by the Wahabi sect of Sunni Islam, which is in turn hosted and protected by the Saudi royal family. Unlike many books on the US/Saudi connection, this one doesn't spin off into blame assignment or polemics on solar power and tax policy. Baer stays focussed on the central question: How did we get into the unhealthy and too-close relationship, and just how bad is it?<br />The roots reach back to Franklin Roosevelt. The supply of oil that had been crucial to the war effort Roosevelt saw as vital to America's postwar development, so he made it permanent. After FDR inked a deal with King Ibn Saud aboard a US warship in 1945, every president from both parties continued and expanded the relationship. One problem, as Baer sees it, is that in all their dealings with Ibn Saud and his successors, American presidents made no mention of Ibn Taymiyah, patron saint of the Muslim Brotherhood. That is to say all administrations failed to take seriously the threat of Muslim fanaticism that has always been present in Saudi Arabia.<br />The US government continues to accept, even post 9/11, intelligence access to our &quot;ally&quot; that is so severely restricted as to be non-existent. Even after the fall of the Soviet Union, when there was no longer any reason to accept restrictions in order to combat a greater evil, nothing changed. <br />For our part, neither Congress nor any administration compelled the CIA and NSA and others to shift their focus and resources to the Muslim Brotherhood, not even after the assassination of Sadat, nor the first World Trade bombing, nor the Luxor attack in 1997, nor dozens of other less publicized attacks. Now the focus and resources are there, but they can't be deployed at the epicenter of Brotherhood growth, Saudi Arabia. Why? Because the Saudis don't want us there. Why don't they want us there? Because they are doing things that can't be justified by any religion or political ideology.<br />Baer's book and career are proof that 9/11 wasn't the result of an &quot;intelligence failure&quot;. He and certain other intelligence agency operatives have long wanted to get more information and take more action against the world's largest terrrorist organization. It was a policy failure of presidents and Congresses, who after the Cold War failed to see the necessity of redirecting the intelligence agencies' resources in general, and of gaining access to Saudi Arabia in particular. One can only hope that books like this will have a stronger influence on policymakers as time goes by.	2004-02-21

The main obstacle that kept me from moving was the thought of a lawyer's fee. Now, this lawyer/author, Christine Sovich, brings the good news that the services of her expensive profession are not necessary to create a perfectly legal will. You can get this book/CD combo for about the price of six minutes of a lawyer's time.<br />I had a list of questions about the process, which the book was concise enough to answer in ten minutes of page flipping.<BR>Question 1. What happens if you die without a will? Answer: A state court decides who gets everything you leave behind. The court makes these decisions in accordance with your state's intestate succession laws. In the process of getting this good and simple answer, my attention was drawn to a fascinating table on page 184 that shows who gets what in various intestate scenarios. For example, if you die unmarried with no surviving children or siblings or parents, your entire estate goes to your grandparents. If they are dead, the state starts searching for aunts and uncles.<br />Question 2. How does one ensure the will is legally binding? Answer: Make sure that you are at least 18 and of sound mind. Make sure the will is in writing, preferably printed. (Video wills are only legal in the state where the Simpsons reside.) Lastly, the will must be signed and dated in the presence of at least 2 and preferably 3 adult witnesses, and the witnesses must also sign and date.<br />Question 3. Who tells the state court that you have a will and that it is legally binding and who carries out its provisions? Answer: The Executor. This impressive title goes to whomever you select for the role. The legal requirements of the executor are the same as for witnesses. The practical requirement is that he or she must be well-organized and knows where to lay hands on your will if you should pass away.<br />After finding these basic things out so quickly and efficiently, I resolved to buy WRITE YOUR WILL IN A WEEKEND as a handbook for the details as I write my will, which may or may not take me a weekend. The writing is clear and plain, but also provides all the mellifluous legal terms that sound Old English, terms like \\"escheat\\" and \\"surety bond\\" and \\"forced heirship\\". Shopping enthusiasts will be interested to know that the legal term for all personal, movable property is \\"personality\\".<br />Sovich has an ability, finely honed during her career as an estate planning lawyer, to bring up all the right questions about the process at the right time, and to answer them--all in 172 pages of fairly large font. The other 160 pages are appendices--interesting and useful in their own way, but not indispensable.	2004-02-14

Sure, Menzies goes overboard at times, as when he asserts in the Postscript that &quot;Coronado's expedition met Chinese people in Tiguex&quot; with nary a &quot;might have&quot; in sight. But isn't it just as great a stretch to suggest, as historians have, that the east coast of Australia was charted for the first time by James Cook in 1769 after sailing about 12,000 miles, when for centuries there had been highly skilled Chinese mariners and cartographers just 2000 miles to the north?<br />Part of the great attraction of Menzies' writing is his exuberant imagination, which is all too rare in historians. On the other hand, his exuberance is tempered and his imagination is informed by a strict military discipline, formed during a career as navigator and commander in the British Royal Navy.<br />Whatever the Chinese may have discovered or charted in 1421--South America, North America, Australia, South Africa...(with a thousand ships gone for 2 years they must have found something) it's a fantastic story. Their felling of vast forests in China and Vietnam to build the fleet and the Forbidden City has obvious parallels to the megalomania of many governments today. Their fondness for a diet rich in vegetables which protected them from scurvy in 1421 (Cook thought sour kraut was the key) was evident still in the 19th century when they built the Central Pacific railroad through the High Sierra, and for that matter evident still on any Chinese restaurant menu today. <br />All in all a refreshing new look at the history of world exploration from a different angle.	2004-02-13

When someone responds negatively to their product they seek to silence that person. Failing that, they repackage the same product. If that doesn't work, they rename the product. Then they present the product in a different size. Anything, abosolutely anything, but listen to the customer who gripes.<br />I don't think Spector grasps the depth of this change. When Amazon gives a forum to ordinary people to speak where previously only &quot;professionals&quot; could, that's as profound a shift as from monarchy to democracy.  Giving equal space on the electronic bookshelf to an arcane book on geology and a convenience store bestseller is as revolutionary as Martin Luther's 95 theses getting equal billing with the pronouncements of the pope. In terms of sales, if I can buy what I want instead of just what the &quot;professionals&quot; want me to buy, I'm going to buy more.<br />Most of the other factors in Amazon's success have been done before: hiring smart people, working long hours, providing great customer service...but no other retailer ever had a selection larger than the Library of Congress. And no other retailer ever gave customers around the globe a public forum for feedback. I would have liked to have seen more on this unique aspect of Amazon in GET BIG FAST, and less of the sort of business school platitudes that make up the &quot;Takeaways&quot; sections at the end of each chapter.	2004-02-10

In most cases the resorts' gouging rest upon a firm foundation of reasonably priced public land leases, usually involving the US Forest Service, an agency of the Dept of Agriculture.<br />This last detail presents a problem for Clifford and his publisher, Sierra Club Books, For as logging and mining revenues to the USDA decline, it is hesitant to raise too sharply the rents or regulations on its new, relatively clean tenants, the resort operators. When Clifford makes the case for saving elk or lynx habitat the Forest Service is no doubt sympathetic, but probably a lot more interested in saving its own budget, and all the jobs that it supports. And a ski run, while not ideal, is a much better place for wildlife to thrive than what's left after a mining company extracts ore.<br />In Colorado there is a pair of sites, both mentioned in DOWNHILL SLIDE: Copper Mtn. Ski Area, and just 5 miles up the road, the mothballed Climax Molybdenum Mine. Copper Mtn has cut down some trees for ski runs and probably uses too much water for snowmaking and doesn't build housing in its &quot;village&quot; for non-rich people--but these are all things that can be fixed. At Climax what is left is agray, treeless wasteland of slag heaps and tailing ponds. Half a mountain has been eaten away and the leftover sludge sluiced onto a vast flat area resembling a parking lot, into which you could fit dozens of parking lots as big as the one at Copper. Clifford spends many pages criticizing Copper and its owner, Intrawest Corp, but cites Climax only in a lone paragraph as a company which paid a good wage to its employees. <br />It seems to me that authors and publishers of perceptive and thoughtful books such as this one ought to propose real solutions to problems they elucidate. For example, why not build  low cost employee housing for Copper Mtn on top of the wasteland at Climax? Anything, but anything they built, even Bauhaus, would be an improvement over what is there now. Looking at a map, one sees that a high speed quad could be run about 3 miles from this proposed employee housing to the top of Copper Mtn, thus cutting down on the commuter traffic from Leadville. The illegal workers discussed in Chapter 9 could realize the all-too-often elusive American Dream of skiing to work.	2004-01-26
US	52767766	R13QFEXVIU1IM4	1566634407	313766150	The Closed Circle: An Interpretation of the Arabs	Books	5	57	60	N	N	None Better on the Arabs	Although it makes one pessimistic about prospects for the Arabs, THE CLOSED CIRCLE gives answers to a lot of the questions that people have about that part of the world, question such as: Why the lack of heavy industry? Why the disdain for higher learning? Why the obsessive hatred of Israel? Why the hopelessly inept militaries? and Why the grandiose bluster they use in place of effective militaries?<br />Pryce-Jones wondered, too, for a lifetime, then took three years to produce this \\"interpretation\\", which is more comprehensive and lucid than any of the other works I've seen on the subject. His thesis is fairly simple: the Arabs, more than any other society, are bound by a code of shame and honor, which prevents them from advancing in nearly every field of human endeavor. The only dynamism in their sclerotic society is what Pryce-Jones calls \\"power challenging\\", the process by which one despot knocks another off his pedestal and assumes it himself, though even this can hardly be called dynamic, since one is just like another. They all operate according to these rules of power challenging, which may more simply be called the law of the jungle.<br />The shame/honor and power challenging theses explain a wide range of phenomena that can be baffling to an outsider. On one of the lowest levels, the village, Pryce-Jones gives the example of a local leader who decides to install an irrigation pump to improve agriculture. When a consultant warns of technical problems, the leader avoids the shame of appearing ignorant by pushing ahead with his plan, heedless of the warning. The pump overirrigates, leading to salinification, which ruins the village agriculture. But instead of being blamed by the village for the ruin, the local leader is honored for getting his way.<br />On a larger scale, why is it that Saudi Arabia, whose total revenues from oil some time ago passed the trillion dollar mark, needs the USA to defend it, needs American and European technicians to operate itsoilfields, and needs imported labor from South Asia for any non-technical work? Simple: \\"Technical tasks, and of course laboring in all forms, demeaningly connote low status, and therefore shame.\\" Thus, the Saudi squadrons of AWACS and other warplanes, and tanks, and sophisticated naval equipment, etc., are virtually useless to them, because while the purchase of such stuff brings honor, the maintenance and operation of it is low class and shameful. A fighter jet is little more than a trophy to show off to ones friends-and enemies. Rather than use a jet to defend themselves, \\"Al Saud prefer the technique of using money defensively...and to convert possible challengers into clients...the Saudis extend their money-favor nexus over the whole Middle East, enmeshing into it the entire spectrum of Arab power holders and challengers. The daily task of the Saudi ruler consists in assessing friends and opponents and then buying or holding them off, estimating and apportioning subsidies, bribes, subventions, the whole gamut of open or concealed transfers of money.\\"<br />Pryce-Jones goes methodically through each Arab society, even one, Turkey, that is not technically Arab, and finds the same pattern in each: leaders that grab their power through violence, and hold onto it through violence and money. Even the much-heralded \\"Man of Peace\\", Anwar Sadat, began his career as a Nazi sympathizer, writing glowingly of Hitler in 1953 that the German had \\"become immortal in Germany\\" and that was \\"reason enough for pride\\". Sadat's subsequent protean career as a power holder took him through \\"pro-Nazi, pro-Soviet, socialist, capitalist, Jew-hater, and peacemaker\\" phases, the one constant being his always-cunning response to power challengers. After finally being murdered by a determined group of challengers, Sadat was commemorated by a handful of American presidents in his last permutation, that of peacemaker. His power holding legacy is carried on by Mubarak with Sadat's methods of repression and ample amounts of money, gotten not from oil, but from US foreign aid-payoffs for peace.<br />Pryce-Jones' thesis is not that all Arabs are murderous and power hungry. It does seem to be that one can't rise beyond a certain level in Arab society without being so. All of the leaders are authoritarian. None of the polities are open and democratic. Anyone who has traveled anywhere in the Middle East or Maghreb has met gentle and hard-working Arabs. Many Arabs would admire a leader such as Martin Luther King. But it would never occur to the leaders of the Arabs to take anything but a venal or violent approach to a problem. It's impossible to conceive, for instance, of Yasser Arafat leading a non-violent protest march through Israeli checkpoints on a day when Gaza was sealed off. Even if he were convinced that such an act would get him what he wanted politically, he would be unable to carry it out because of the enormous shame he would feel at being shown in such an ostensibly powerless position. What is shown in CLOSED CIRCLE is that it is impossible to take power or hold power in Arab society without employing the despotic methods of Gaddhafi or Sadat or Sadam or Faud or Arafat.<br />It's a pity that a book of this stature should be out of print in hardback. Something this vital ought to be available with one of the print-on-demand publishers.	2004-01-13
US	52767766	R1T944GVJ9QGW2	0316091634	468648830	The Houseguest: A Novel	Books	5	6	6	N	N	The Limits of Hospitality	It begins innocuously enough, with an explanation of how the ominous process began which led to the decision to kill a man. And not just any man: a guest. And not just any guest: a guest who is a \\"superb cook\\" and an adept car mechanic and an experienced lifeguard, and has cause to exercise all these skills and more in the service of his hosts and hostesses. As it begins, so it unfolds, that something which appears normal becomes twisted and unpredictable. A family spending time at their beach house is sucked into a vortex of horror and danger which is largely an illusion, and conclude the execution of their guest is the only way out of the vortex.<br />As is customary with Berger the narrator is the most amusing voice, especially when he employs a 19th century formality. When Lydia, one of the family, is saved from drowning it's as though the producers of \\"Baywatch\\" had told Charles Dickens exactly what they wanted and he did his best to give it to them: \\"'Lydia!'a stern, almost military voice cried down. It was the person, a man who had earlier been kissing her, not for erotic purposes but to claim her for life; ... performing the emergency maneuvers by which she might be revived.\\"<br />And after her revival: \\"She was offended by (his) tone, but in the next instant remembered it was he who saved her life and so acquired a certain authority over it. She wept softly, humiliated by the memory of the powerlessness into which she had fallen with the first grasp of the undertow.\\"<br />The narrator expresses the crude facile TVish thoughts of each character in stately, elegant turns of speech worthy of the greatest masters of the form. All characters that is, except Chuck, the houseguest, who remains an enigma. We never are privy to his thoughts, only to his speech and actions, which swing wildly from flip to analytic, from accomodating to provocative, from solicitous to menacing and back again. No one even knows who invited him to the house, yet he is virtually omniscent, dominating each encounter with the others, laying bare their secrets and reveling in their discomfiture.<br />One finds this delightfully bizarre comic sensibility in the opening of many novels--novels which usually degenerate into tedious formulaic moralizing. Berger maintains the magic to the very end.	2003-12-10

A diplomat is always a bore. SIR VIDIA'S SHADOW contains two writers, fully opinionated, and no diplomats. There is much about VS Naipaul in this portrait by Paul Theroux that is the sort of thing that is normally obscured by diplomacy: ambition, egotism, overbearance, intransigence, candor...Naipaul is a real piece of work, and Theroux shows him in all his glory. Perhaps he went further into the personal than was proper, but that is Naipaul's misfortune, not ours.<br />I've read many other books by Theroux and Naipaul, some good, others less than that. I like the nonfiction of both better than their fiction. But never have I read anything by either of them as compelling as this. I tore through SIR VIDIA'S SHADOW in two sittings. I don't know whether it's due more to Naipaul's charm or the skill of SIR VIDIA'S author, Theroux.<br />They begin in Uganda, sparring, as writers do, over other writers. Theroux mentions his admiration for Nabokov, whom Naipaul rejects: \\"Forget Nabokov. Read Death in Venice. Pay close attention to the accumulation of thought.\\" This dismissal was surprising because as the persona of Vidia the Great Writer was developed through the book I was reminded constantly of Nabokov, particularly Nabokov's volume of criticism called STRONG OPINIONS. And Nabokov's scorn of Mann was second only to his scorn of Freud. But Naipaul and Nabokov have in common their legendary erudition, their strong opinions expressed elegantly, seldom dipping into vulgarity, their rootless lives lived mostly far from their natal homes, their wary eyes kept peeled for the brutes of the world--Naipaul sees at once that Uganda is on theverge of anarchy and goes around asking the people what they will do when the \\"crunch\\" comes. Just five years later the crunch does come in the form of Idi Amin.<br />Coming from Third World squalor himself, Naipaul has no patience for the make believe that constitutes Ugandan government, universities, and newspapers. He marries, 30 years later, the same female about whom he says, in a spasm of vituperation, \\"What a horrible child!\\" Then the irony becomes still heavier when Theroux, a lover of children, is harshly abused by the new wife of his longtime friend.<br />Theroux reveal nearly as much of himself as of Naipaul while playing a sort of straight man to his friend's winsome incorrigibility. The pair could hardly be more dissimilar: while Naipaul is driven into a foul mood just by the nearness of African families laughing and playing music on a Sunday, Theroux revels in their society, speaking Swahili, teaching English, and coupling with African women with joyous abandon. Somewhere in Theroux's other writings I'd gotten the impression that he was a bit of a New England puritan. But next to the fastidious Vidia, who is paralyzed with revulsion merely by a workman sitting on his (Naipaul's) bed, Theroux looks positively sybaritic.<br />The writing is so fluid and well-timed that it looks easy. But there is so much, such exquisite renderings of dozens of day-to-day encounters over the course of 30 years, that Theroux must either have the memory of an Intel chip, or the exuberant creativity of the finest writers of fiction, or both. SIR VIDIA'S SHADOW rises far above mere biography or memoir to become a marvellous work of art.	2003-12-02

Not Barbara Ehrenreich. This slim volume is kept lively with its self-deprecating humor and biting wit. True, some of the players are ready made self-parodies, such as WalMart, which urges its employees to think of their managers not as bosses, but &quot;servant leaders&quot;, and of goofing off not as goofing off, but &quot;time theft&quot;.<br />But Ehrenreich goes beyond such easy pickings in her talks with the &quot;Wal-Martians&quot; to find deeper levels of comic thought. The servant leader at her job interview had read Sam Walton's book and &quot;found that the three pillars of Wal-Mart philosophy precisely fit her own, and these are service, excellence (or something like that), and she can't remember the third&quot;. On the personality survey part of the application the servant leader assures Ehrenreich that there are &quot;no right or wrong answers&quot;, and tells her ten minutes later that she's gotten three answers wrong.<br />In her time as a maid in Maine, she learns that the trend in cleaning is to keep the use of water to a minimum. The focus is on the &quot;cosmetic touches&quot;:fluffing pillows, combing the fringes of rugs, leaving a &quot;fernlike pattern&quot; with the tracks of a vacuum cleaner. The maid in Maine section is unlikely to cause housekeepers in New England to organize, but may welll give pause to those middle class millions who in the nineties go the absurd idea that they were too busy or exalted to clean their own homes. As maid, Ehrenreich notes all the quirks of the maid service system even as she cleans, exercising fully her gift for wry observation. At one point I thought she had veered into homoeroticism as she related scrubbing submissively on her hands and knees at the feet of a dominant rich woman (a certain Mrs.W), but it turned out that Mrs. W. had only come close to the scrubbing maid/narrator to remind her to do the entryway.<br />In each of her jobs--waitress, maid, retail clerk--she details the frustrations and humiliations that anyone who had held such a job knows all too well, then couples this struggle with the struggle to find low cost housing--and never finds a viable match; that is, never finds a place to live that will not break her low wage budget. It should be noted that in this search for housing she only goes to multiplex corporate facilities such as motels and apartment buildings (and once to a trailor park), never exploring the possiblities in non-transient neighborhoods where apartments in houses or small buildings are offered by ordinary people needing additional income. This is odd considering activists' usual passion for community interactivity.<br />Strange, too, is her classification of cigarettes on p.213 as a cost of living rather than an avoidable tax on the poor and ignorant, the very reverse of health insurance. She is silent on other tax matters that affect the poor as well, such as the flat payroll tax which begins gnawing into low wage workers' earnings the moment they pick up the cleaning rag. Nor does she say whether she conscientously calculated and paid (as required by law) the tax on her tip income in Florida.<br />Still, NICKEL AND DIMED is generally thoughtful and a pleasure to read. A good sequel to it would find the author going undercover as a small (or large) business owner determined to make her enterprise successful while at the same time paying a &quot;living wage&quot; to her mostly unskilled and uneducated employees.	2003-11-25

I found out eventually how to sell, but not the cost, and not quickly.<br />I began by browsing the inspirational stories of people who'd sold all they wanted and more and of people who'd bought an item they'd been searching for for years. Then I went to the beginning to learn about eBay. But the beginning is geared for people who are turning on their computers for the first time: what is email? what is a browser? &quot;Clicking a link will move you forward to that page&quot; etc...<br />So I skipped to the section on how to sell. Again I found myself swamped with basic info. For example, Griffith devotes several pages to explaining step by step the sort of registration process most people have gone through dozens of times on other sites. Then he goes into digital photography for 36 pages. All useful, no doubt, to someone who has decided to sell. But not to someone who wants some idea of PRICE. <br />I went to the index to look up &quot;fees&quot;. I found three entries, two of which (Final Value Fee and Turbolister) were arcane and of no use to me. The other was &quot;listings&quot;. Thinking I'd found what I wanted, I quickly flipped to p.273, where I found, not a schedule of fees nor a percentage of any kind, but rather a tiny reproduction of a web page with tiny numbers representing the fees for a ceramic jug pictured on the previous page.<br />What is going on here? Is eBay shy about money? Are they ashamed of charging fees and making money? Do they want to imply in their &quot;Official Bible&quot; that their services are free? Did Griffith neglect to put in this information because it was not upbeat enough for his enthusiastic compendium of online auctioneering?<br />Another annoying feature is the vast amount of white space on each page, with tiny reproductions of web pages marooned in the middle. Is it too much to ask that publishers blow up the web page images so that their text is at least equal in font size to that of the book itself? I've noticed this trend in other computer books. What is this passion for empty white space? If a web page image is so unimportant that it can be shown at one third the size of the regular text, why show it at all?<br />Griffith goes on to discuss topics such as setting up your own store and dealing with piles of feedback, but this reader had lost heart, and in any case could not find his magnifying glass.	2003-11-18
US	52767766	R3UQ2ZITAPCG0L	0385245300	135972287	Long Time Gone: The Autobiography of David Crosby	Books	5	54	59	N	N	More Entertaining Than The Music	David Crosby had the good sense to enlist help in writing this book--lots of help--and the result is stunning. Instead of a typically self-absorbed druggy memoir, it becomes part oral history, part biography, part raree show--all in all a sweeping portrait of a man and an era. The list of celebrities and hangers-on who contribute their recollections is long, too long to give here. Among the most amusing is David Geffen, the producer, who was, in his own words, \\"a formidable figure always\\". Not formidable enough, however, to keep himself from being bullied by Crosby into taking an envelope of weed through airport security and being handcuffed and jailed.<br />Geffen had already begun to have doubts about his business relations with the singer after Crosby talked him into financing a movie in which \\"a tribe of nomads arrives at a campsite, spends a night and a day, and moves on, leaving the environment lovingly unblemished\\". The script was written by Crosby and an equally stoned partner. Geffen perceived at once that the film would be something less than a blockbuster, and pulled the plug on it even as Crosby was scouting locations.<br />But this sort of thing was quite mild compared to the hilarity of Crosby's hard drug phase, which followed his soft drug phase. Marijuana gave way to cocaine, and cocaine led to the breakdown of the barrier between his nostrils. As a precautionary measure, Crosby switched to freebase cocaine, which is smoked rather than snorted. This effort at health protection was in vain, however, as freebase turned out to be one of the most addictive substances on earth, demanding tribute from its hapless user virtually round the clock. So fierce was his desire to get the stuff into his lungs that he excused himself from a crisis intervention featuring such stars as Jackson Browne, Graham Nash, and Grace Slick, to go to the back room to be alone with his pipe.<br />And, with a propane torch for the odd procedure which turns ordinary cocaine into \\"freebase\\" Crosby slipped many times, leaving his body not \\"lovingly unblemished\\", but rather covered with burns and impetigo. By the eighties he was consuming thousands of dollars worth a day of the drug, and his life became a dizzing round of nightclubs, treatment centers, airplane rides (paying no attention to the illumination of the No Smoking sign), and binges with the ever-present torch and pipe in operation even while driving. \\"'I'm the best no-hands knee-steering driver in the world,' he would reassure startled passengers.\\" <br />That may have been true, but in 1982 he passed out from coke overload while on his way to a demonstration at a nuclear power plant, and smashed into the center divider of the San Diego Freeway, and was busted by the Man. Here is laid bare the dilemma of the addict/activist: in order to save the people from radiation, he must at the same time endanger the people by driving while comatose. Law enforcement, after a couple more such incidents, decided he was a clear and present danger.<br />Yet he hung on for another 4 years, struggling to live as a functioning addict, even as his friends abandon him and the long arm of the law reaches ever closer. Obdurate to the point of psychosis, Crosby continues to cling to his guitar and torch and pipe until he has nowhere to turn but the nearest police station to make a clean breast of things. He finally kicks his addiction for good, not in the plush confines of Betty Ford, but in a solitary confinement box in a Texas prison, and emerges about a year later, with a greater knowledge of himself and of mattress fabrication procedures.<br />If there ever was a story about which the phrase \\"cautionary tale\\" is not a cliche, this is it. I'm surprised Geffen hasn't made it into a blockbuster.	2003-11-10
US	52767766	R2TMII3ELG7UIL	0911469036	91099686	Stalking The Wild Asparagus	Books	5	94	95	N	N	Ancient Cuisine	Toward the end of ASPARAGUS, Euell Gibbons relates stopping during a stroll with his wife \\"at a couple of blooming elder bushes and collecting  a bag of elder blow with next morning's breakfast in mind\\". Clearly, he has a recipe for this strange woodland product, elder blow. That's just one of the strengths of this very strong volume: plenty of recipes and tips to make wild fare taste good. Unlike today's whole food zealot, Gibbons doesn't hesitate to add refined food such as butter or bacon or sugar to his natural bounty. He is equally authoritative on cooking as on gathering, giving clear steps on making everything from stuffed grape leaves to fried frog's legs to Elder Blow Fritters.<br />But for me the real charm of Gibbons is his evocation of how we ate in the past; far, far in the past when all food was wild food. He speculates that mankind has probably eaten \\"many millions of tons more of acorns...than of the cereal grains\\". Fascinating, when you consider that no groceries now carry this formerly prevalent staple, as though it were as useless as an 8-track tape. Gibbons reminds that dandelions were prescribed by primitive doctors to ward off diseases caused by vitamin deficiency long before we had any concept of a vitamin. He is mindful, as he plucks wild grape leaves, that the Vikings reported the presence of grapes on our continent a thousand years ago, and thought that important enough to name it Vinland.<br />His style is what one would expect from an amiable, erudite grandfather, a member of one of the last generations that saw starvation in America, and that knew the delight of tasting fresh spring greens after a long winter without vegetables. His type is often dismissed as corny and hopelessly outdated because they persist in old habits that have been rendered obsolete by refrigeration  and truck farms. But his type pays no attention to such ridicule, focussing instead on the joys of hunting and gathering--not just for the meat and free vegetables, but also the pleasure of a \\"creative protest against the artificiality of our daily lives\\" or the pleasure of observing a \\"child's unspoiled sense of wonder\\" at \\"living, at least in part, as our more primitive forebears did\\". Reading ASPARAGUS is like watching such a child.	2003-11-10
US	52767766	R3JOZBIBUFFW6A	0895263025	278651227	Partners in Power: The Clintons and Their America	Books	3	15	21	N	N	Seignorial Privilege	I looked forward to reading about the early life of Bill Clinton and his early marriage and the Arkansas days, etc, and this book has a lot on that--quite substantial. So I was a little shocked to arrive at page 440, where Morris refers to &quot;Clinton's extra-marital relations with literally hundreds of women&quot; Hundreds? That would be a minimum of 200. That's really quite a lot. I had always assumed a dozen or two.<br />I began to wonder how that would work. Is a governorship such an easy job (just a lot of paper signing and speechifying) that an accomplished shmoozer can fit it in between hundreds of trysts? Whatever you think of his politics, it must be admitted that it's quite an accomplishment, especially considering he wasn't really all that interested in the governorship or the trysts, but rather the presidency.<br />And what of the &quot;Partner in Power&quot;? Could she see early on that her husband was a politician of such consumate skill that he was a shoe-in for the presidency, and so chose to overlook his turning Arkansas into his personal harem? And what of Hilary's other partner in power, Vince Foster, now dead? If Morris touches on their &quot;semi-private kisses and furtive squeezes&quot;, an &quot;intimate professional bond between two attorneys&quot;, then surely he ought to dig a bit deeper on the cause of Foster's death. No sign of depression prior to the suicide. No death threats. What on earth happened to Vince Foster.<br />All these deeply intriguing topics--Bill's monumental multi-tasking, Hillary's apparent acquiescence, Foster's mysterious death--are touched on but lightly. What really interests Morris is financial scandal, into which category he places, seemingly, any transaction over $10,000. The book is larded with endless, and I mean Endless, details of money for campaigns, money made in teal estate, many made in banking, in retail, in government, in law, in public and in private--all with the implication or explicit assertion that a crime was committed. And Morris doesn't stop with the Clintons. The Republicans  and Reagan in particular come under his moral lash for using too much money to get elected or to celebrate having been elected. Literally hundreds of pages are devoted to venting his indignation at the expenditure of money in politics, almost as though he believes that the only ones fit to govern are indigent altar boys or investigative reporters.<br />This reader would have liked less of the sort or quasi-incrimminatory fodder that fills the pages of the Village Voice and more probing into the feudatory state of Arkansas, perhaps interviewing some of the hundreds of women. There's a gripping story there, a noir classic, but I doubt it will be revealed by poring over old account ledgers.	2003-11-06
US	52767766	R28KCETHBHE3WZ	0684842548	62503323	Vietnam the Necessary War: A Reinterpretation of America's Most Disastrous Military Conflict	Books	3	56	77	N	N	Credibility Calculus	As a child, watching reports of the Vietnam War on TV, I was puzzled. I had seen movies and read books about World War II, in which American and Russsian forces pushed straight to Berlin to cut off the enemy's head. Why weren't we doing that now? Where was the push to Hanoi? The adults patted my little head. It's not that simple, Timmy. We don't want to take Hanoi. We just want to change their behavior. If we bomb them, but refrain from taking control of their country, they'll realize we mean well and they'll change their behavior.<br />Now comes Michael Lind to pat the heads of all who would question the Best and the Brightest's most famous and ghastly fiasco. The dust jacket touts his demolishing of &quot;the stale orthodoxies of the left and the right&quot;. The first stale orthodoxy to be demolished is the idea that we should not have have gone in the first place. Hence the title: Necessary War. Lind's view is that it was a proxy battle in the Cold War. Nothing new in that, but it does come as news to me that the reason for Vietnam was to demonstrate our &quot;credibility as a military superpower&quot;. Not only did this flimsy reason suffice for war, according to the author, but to achieve this credibility it was &quot;not necessary for the United States to win the Vietnam War&quot;.<br />I had to reread this section several times to be sure I hadn't misconstrued his meaning or come across an editing lapse. No, it was really there: the reason to go to war in Vietnam was to Demonstrate our Credibility. We didn't really have to win, or even stay very long. How long? Lind doesn't measure it in months or years. He measures it in lives. This calculation, which befouls page 79, asserts: &quot;Washington should have imposed an informal limit on the number of American lives it was willing to spend&quot;. It &quot;ended up spending nearly sixty thousand lives&quot; when, according to Lind, it could only &quot;afford to lose 15,000-20,000 soldiers...before the public turned against it.&quot; You don't need to win to retain credibility and prestige, just &quot;spend&quot; 20,000 lives (excluding the 900,000 Vietnamese--they don't count), cut your losses, and split.<br />Perhaps growing up in the computer age has caused Lind to confuse war with a video game. I certainly hope I'm not the first to point out that American lives, nor Vietnamese lives, are not chips to be spent by him and the other senior fellows in Washington on some nebulous product called American Prestige or American Credibility. Of course, such callous speculation is not new or fresh. The monocled, frock-coated diplomats of the first World War sent millions to the slaughter for...what was it? French prestige? German credibility? There are many things worth fighting for, but prestige and credibility are not among them.<br />Lind then moves on to another orthodoxy to demolish, what he pretentiously calls the &quot;praetorian critique&quot;. This is the notion, held by the expendable grunts in the military, that they were not allowed to win in Vietnam. He dismisses as &quot;myth&quot; this belief held by &quot;92% of Vietnam veterans polled by the VA&quot;, and also by Ronald Reagan. He then ticks off a number of reasons why we couldn't seize Hanoi, which boil down to 1)The Chinese would come 2)The Russians would come. But his main &quot;fresh&quot; contention to demolish the stale praetorian critique is that the war was not winnable because the US military was too inflexible to adapt to a guerilla war. But that's okay because we didn't need to win to demonstrate our credibility, which, you'll remember, was the whole point of the war in the first place.<br />This line of thinking--we have to go to war to show our credibility, but we can't win the war, but that's okay because we can still show our credibility by losing, and the losing can be blamed on the military, and nobody will mention that civilians control the military--this line of thinking is the very fault line that gave rise to the conservative orogeny which continues to this day, which is not coincidentally a movement grounded in common sense and common decency. Common sense tells you you're not going to be the first military in history to win a war by remaining permanently on the defensive. Common decency dictates that you don't send conscripted boys to be traumatized and maimed and paralyzed and killed unless you have a very good reason. Preservation of Prestige is not such a reason. It's not even close.<br />Back when I was watching this war on TV it never occurred to me that people in power in America could think this way about their own citizenry. This book shows that people like Michael Lind and Lyndon Johnson who view war as a sort of board game or adjunct to the election process are fairly common.	2003-10-10

I thought particularly strong  the early chapters on colonial and post-revolution America. One sees in Jefferson an early version of a common type today: the person who is adamantly opposed to debt and credit instruments because he himself is hopelessly swamped in debt. Today's debt paranoiac shuns credit cards and deferred payment schemes of all stripes in favor of cash (paper dollars and checks drawn on bank accounts). But for Jefferson those very paper dollars and banks were suspect. For him, the only \\"real\\" money was metallic: gold or silver. The only stores of value in his opinion were coins or bullion or land.<br />This brought him into opposition to Hamilton, who wanted to inaugurate the new republic by assuming a huge load of debt (all the promises of payment represented by the wartime \\"Continentals\\"). Hamilton had a plan to set up a bank and issue paper money backed by gold reserves which didn't exist yet, but which he was confident could be built up by land sales and import duties. His plan, a risky scheme in Jefferson's opinion, was approved by Congress, and our little country began its life with a whopping 42 million dollar debt (p. 102). In spite of Jefferson's misgivings, the scheme worked so well that some twenty years later Jefferson himself was able to double the nation's land area by buying Louisiana from Napoleon.<br />I was disappointed that in this book, devoted as it is to various forms the dollar took over the years, no mention was made of the exact type of payment by Jefferson for Louisiana. Was it gold bullion? American gold dollars? Spanish gold dollars? Was there some of the paper money that he so despised? Was there a mortgage involved? Or a more racy installment plan (No interest and no payments until May 1808, or until the emperor conquers Russia, whichever comes first! Don't delay! Act now!)<br />\\"Greenback\\" then goes into satisfying detail on the banknote phenomenon, the system of the 19th century whereby banks printed notes (dollars, promises to pay) and either backed them up or did not back them up with gold in their vaults. As I understand it, the US government did not start printing such notes until the Civil War, and it did not become the sole legal printer of dollars until the 1920s. I would have liked more detail about how that latter change came about. What was the exact last day when you could use a dollar printed by a bank. Why did they wait so long to pass such a law, which seems perfectly natural to us now? Might the conversion have had anything to do with the subsequent worldwide depression? All fascinating questions for a follow-up volume which I hope will come from the febrile pen of Mr. Goodwin.	2003-05-27
US	52767766	R24BBH49XM8LTW	014023828X	480160740	The Tortilla Curtain (Penguin Books with Reading Guides)	Books	5	10	12	N	N	A Better Sort of Unwashed Horde	The Steinbeck epigraph that precedes this novel is apt; Boyle  is a true heir of the Steinbeck tradition. It's all here: the slangy language; the hard luck; the jarring, ugly, inhumanity that pops up in lovely, fragrant California. But Boyle also adds an element not present in Steinbeck: the comical antics of those in L.A. who may be termed The Fortunate Ones. Here is the Realtor who treats dogs like people and vice versa. Here is the Realtor's husband, an effete Sierra Club type who, when not inflicting granola and fiber bars on his son, is typing precious essays on nature topics reminiscent of Boot's \\"Lush Places\\". Steinbeck didn't have a lot of empathy or sympathy for the Fortunate Ones, but Boyle wades right in and finds out what they're all about. Then he juxtaposes what they're all about with the endless struggle and misery of the Not-so-Fortunate Ones, achieving an effect that is often grotesque.<br />One of the main themes of Tortilla Curtain is the unwashed hordes washing over California, both underpinning and undermining the society that has evolved there since Mexico \\"ceded\\" it to the U.S. The historical irony that a courtly and gracious society was overrun by unwashed hordes of mostly poor Americans in the 19th century lends color to this 20th century narrative. Here, where the camino real has been transmogrified into Camino Realty, vegetarians and activists eye the dirty people from the leather confines of their luxury vehicles and fret about property values and environmental degradation. The dirty people, neo-Joads, sleep on the ground at night John Muir style and loiter by day at the labor exchange, wondering how fate can be so lopsided. A young woman dreams for \\"one of those houses...a clean white one made out of lumber that smells like the mountains, with a gas range and a refrigerator and maybe a little yard so you can plant a garden...nothing fancy, no palaces-just four walls and a roof. Was that so much to ask?\\"<br />Yes, it is, comes the answerfrom the owners of the palaces, the Arroyo Blanco Community Association. The answer to the threat of the unwashed hordes is a security wall and a security gate to keep out all unwashed hordes and wild dogs. It is to be built by contractors employing unwashed hordes. And they damn well better not loiter near the wall after they've finished building it.<br />Of course this is fiction and one can't draw too many conclusions about the immigration problem from a highly entertaining story crafted by an artist whose mastery of his medium ranks with Berger and Updike. But one message is inescapable: sweet, gentle people who come illegally to the U.S. to work (and, yes, to eat and sleep and have babies, too) are not as great a threat as, for example, those who come to bring dangerous drugs or take flying lessons. They ought to be treated like people, whether one welcomes them or sends them back.	2003-04-18

He admits it's a little illegal, but notes too the chances of getting caught are slim. So it makes good business sense-low risk/reward ratio, opportunity galore, and anyway you've sort of been at loose ends since retiring from the navy. Heck, you've got to be bold and take some risks to get anywhere in this world.<br />Or it might go like this: you're a young man and you admire and respect your dad. Nothing unusual in that-he's your dad! He was in the navy and he wants you to follow in his footsteps, so you do. And he says he'll pay you good money for classified documents-sure it's a little risky, but if you want to be a Man you have to take a risk now and then. Or, you could live your life as a wimp. It's your choice. So that leads to the most bone-chilling scene in the horror story: Dad smirking and wise-cracking while his son, his own and only son, is gets life in prison. Well, 25 years, but to a 22-year-old, that's life.<br />Howard Blum did a lot of research for this book: countless interviews, reams of technical documents on law and espionage and naval procedure, letters. But it doesn't read like some legal tract or academic research project. It reads like a B movie script, tawdry and melodramatic, with much attention given to the day-to-day problems of international spies and their families: the alcoholic wife, the wayward children, the ... struggle for respect. And when it's over there is the melancholy realization that the alcoholic wife and the wayward children were the lucky ones, if you can call it that. They avoided the lure of the psychotic monster at the center of the drama. The son was next luckiest. I read that he got out on parole after 15 years.parole after 15 years.	2003-04-18

It is this blessing-and-curse quality of the opiates that is the foundation of Martin Booth's sweeping work, \\"Opium\\". After 350 pages of truly engrossing history, he sums up with a few words: \\"few doctors would be hard-hearted enough to practise medicine without it. Millions have been enslaved by it: yet it has also destroyed millions of lives, enslaved whole cultures, and invidiously corrupted human society to its very core.\\"<br />To those who would legalize the stuff and be done with it, I recommend the chapter on Britain in the Industrial Revolution. Mothers fed their babies \\"soothing syrups\\" purchased legally at the local apothecary. Such syrups contained laudanum or morphine in order to quiet the crying of babies and help them sleep. These things the syrups did, but they also addicted the children, so that by the age of three or four they resembled \\"little old men or (were) wizened like a little monkey\\".<br />Those who favor the get-tough methods currently in vogue in the US would do well to read of the ups and downs of the international traffic over the last two centuries.  The odds of defeating a business as lucrative as heroin seem to be very slim indeed. The emperor of China couldn't do it, and neither have any of the US administrations. In fact, China seems to be one of the hotbeds of the trade, and US consumption is high. Booth doesn't make any recommendations, for it's not a public policy book, as is Jill Jonnes' equally excellent history, which recommends stigmatization of drug use and conducting a war against the trade. \\"Opium\\" rather shows where we've been (we being just about every society on the globe) and the current state of things. As for the future, Booth doesn't hazard a guess or push a solution. He doesn't have to. His illumination of the long and tortured history of humans and the poppy is enough to suggest a middle course, neither drug war nor drug festival.	2001-08-04
US	52767766	R3KNPONAPL49DP	0965187926	389070090	The Empty Quarter	Books	4	4	6	N	N	So That's What They Do Over There With All Work And No Play	I once pondered, from my squalid apartment in Boston, joining a friend who was heading down to Texas to get a job on an oil rig. He told me nothing could go wrong and the pay was stratospheric. The oil industry was in dire need of guys like us to help get their oil out of the ground and into gastanks where it belonged. Still, due to certain unanswered questions,  I continued to hesitate. Then my friend went on a five week drinking binge and nothing ever came of the plan to go to Texas.<br /> Now, twenty years later, &quot;The Empty Quarter&quot; answers all my questions, questions like: Are there girls on oil rigs? Do roughnecks really mix their drinks with screwdrivers like it says in Trivial Pursuit? Does one have to be physically strong to be a roughneck? Is the title literal, i.e., is the employment contingent on the condition of the neck. Is roughneck related in any way to redneck? Or is the condition of the neck a result of the job, and if so, does it happen to women, too, or are their necks protected by long silky hair tumbling luxuriantly from under their hardhats? If there are no women on oil rigs, do they work close by in some sort of air-conditioned office, or, in the case of an offshore rig, on a boat moored within shouting distance of the platform? What is the social status of a roughneck? Is he or she afforded the same level of personal dignity as, say, a busboy in a New Wave dance club?<br />The story takes place on a rig in Saudi Arabia, where the protagonist, Logan, struggles to escape from the smothering influence of his onetime mentor, Jamie Strong. They are not roughnecks, having moved up a few notches on the oilfield ladder. They command a crew of roughnecks, who are from India. Far from being rednecks, these roughnecks are practicing Muslims, who send their earnings home to destitute families, much as Mexicans do from their jobs in the US. The Indians are treated less than respectfully by the Americans and Europeans, much as Mexicans are treated in Texas or California. In fact, the whole scenario is reminiscent of Texas of the Fifties, with Strong playing a sort of Lyndon Johnson, a powerful and demented yokel, with no thought of anything outside his own gluttonous appetites. <br />On a previous job in the North Sea, Strong had manipulated some machinery so as to deliberately maim some English roughnecks whom he felt did not show him the proper deference. During the investigation of the crime he switches tactics from swaggering to sniveling, and suborns the callow Logan to perjure himself. In this way he at once evades punishment and brings Logan further under his power by involving him in the crime. <br />Sadly enough, there are no women on oil rigs, and this could partially explain the tolerance of and connivance in racism and mayhem, since men do trend more toward bestiality when women are not present. It's unclear whether their nonpresence is due to Saudi strictures on mingling of the sexes, or to the heavy nature of the equipment used. &quot;Empty Quarter&quot; is full of huge and deadly machinery: tongs, drawworks drum, slug tank, rotary table, cathead... but none of it is never defined or explained in any way, which lends a patina of historicity to the story, as though it were an actual journal dug out of a roughneck's battered locker in the aftermath of an industrial accident.<br />So, too, does the story of &quot;Empty Quarter&quot; play out: inexplicable yet seemingly inexorable. The men on the rig rank themselves by race in an era when race has been discredited as a means to determine quality; they settle their differences by brawling in an age when lawsuits and subterfuge have been shown more effective in vanquishing foes. Most puzzling of all is that all the brawling and race-baiting and hatred is in the quest of a commodity that they won't even own, that their own nations won't even own when it is finally gotten out of the ground, so that these poor myopic men are at each other's throats fora few bucks an hour, like Treasure of the Sierra Madre set in a Taco Bell. All in all, it seems a tale of a world that is already disappearing. Probably by now there is software that can do Strong or Logan's job better than either of them--and not fly into a murderous rage when the roughnecks disobey it.	2001-07-25
US	52767766	R2MUXWZ8CGOQ41	0805057404	242443224	Drinking the Sea at Gaza: Days and Nights in a Land Under Siege	Books	4	36	43	N	N	Take A Closer Look. Recall What It Was Like.	It's well established that most child abusers were themselves abused as children. It's now  apparent that the same cycle occurs on the national level. The Jews, having been abused for centuries and brought to the very brink of annihilation, now abuse millions of people  with tactics and methods typically found in fascism. The fact that the government of Israel is not fascist does nothing to ameliorate the suffering of those within its borders whom it treats as refugees and prisoners of war and second class citizens. <br />Amira Hass, an Israeli journalist, has documented this appalling mess admirably. The ridiculous notion promulgated elsewhere on this page that &quot;Drinking the Sea&quot; is a Marxist tract &quot;built on rage&quot; has no basis in reality. Hass may or may not be a Marxist, but in 352 pages I saw nothing promoting communism or socialism--and I do look for that kind of thing.  As for it's being &quot;built on rage&quot;, one might as well sniff about Solzhenitsyn's work being &quot;built on rage&quot; or Elie Wiesel's or Harry Wu's. When it comes to the inhumanity described by these writers and by Hass,  rage is not a bad thing. However, I did not see it in this book. To the contrary, I found her treatment of an outrageous subject very even-handed, almost blandly journalistic at times. <br />One shortcoming in &quot;Drinking the Sea&quot; was a the lack of a minimal background to place Gaza into an historic and demographic framework for those around the world who don't know Gaza from Giza. It could be easily done just by extending the chronology on page xv back about fifty years to the Thirties, when Jews began arriving in great numbers in Palestine, an unincorporated area roughly the size of New Hampshire or Belize. Already living in Palestine were roughly one million Muslims, who didn't claim any particular nationality for themselves. That number grew to about 1.3 million by the time Israel established itself in 1948. About 800,000 of them were driven out of their homes when the Arab states attacked Israel (note that the Arabs are distinct from Palestinians; the Palestinians have never had a military). Some of the refugees went to Egypt, some to Jordan, some to Syria, and some went to Gaza, a tiny strip of desert next to the Mediterranean. When Hass arrived there in 1993 to cover a story for an Israeli paper, it was home to close to a million Palestinians.<br />While ostensibly under the control of the nascent Palestinian state, Hass painstakingly explains how Gaza is in reality under the control of Israel, whose soldiers run it like a prison camp. I found it fascinating that within Gaza there are Palestinian roads and Israeli roads. The Israeli roads are for access to Israeli settlements within Gaza, and also for the Israeli army to patrol and shoot anyone who seems to be threatening said settlements. In other words, Gaza is to be under Palestinian control eventually, except for those areas that are settled by Israelis and those areas that the army needs to protects the areas settled by Israelis. In other words, Palestine is not to be a real state, but rather a well-guarded labor pool for Israel. And if the laborers get uppity in any way (rock-throwing, curfew violation, tax evasion, unauthorized movement), Gaza is &quot;hermetically sealed&quot;. <br />Any house in Gaza suspected of harboring troublemakers (rock-throwers, pamphlet-writers) is destroyed. Young men are hauled away in the middle of the night to spend years in Israeli prisons. Men under the age of forty or unmarried men of any age are not allowed to cross into Israel to work. Those who try to build a business within Gaza are effectively crushed by the frequent sealings of the border. Produce rots before it can be released for shipment to export markets. Materials coming into Gaza must be inspected by Israeli officials, at their leisure. Storage fees must be paid by Gaza businesspeople while they wait, sometimes months, for the Israeli officials to inspect the shipments.<br />There is no justification for treating a people this way. Running off to Washington for meetings and photo opportunities is no solution. Tightening the vice on Gaza is no solution. The conclusion I draw from this book is that the solution lies in treating the Palestinians as the Jews would like to have been treated in Europe over the centuries: as a people entitled to the same dignity and humanity as those who wield the power.	2001-01-15
US	52767766	R1S3I2A5SRV9E9	0060194545	230910287	The Secret War Against Hanoi: Kennedy's and Johnson's Use of Spies, Saboteurs, and Covert Warriors In North Vietnam	Books	4	12	14	N	N	Turned out less well than the Peace Corps	As each book based on declassified data comes out, the story of Vietnam and the Great American Stumble there becomes more clear.<br /> &quot;The Secret War Against Hanoi&quot; is particularly good in its own way. It elucidates the liberal train of thought as they were starting the war in 1961. On January 28 Kennedy had been president for 8 days. Vietnam was divided, the French were gone, and the Viet Cong were prosecuting a campaign of terrorism in the South in order to destabilize it  and absorb it into the North. On that day Kennedy met with his National Security Council and listened to what was (in his view) the bad news on Vietnam: if the current conditions persisted, the South would fall to the Communists.<br />Why a little underdeveloped country in Asia should have been of such concern to Kennedy is anyone's guess, but what is no longer in doubt is that major American involvement in Vietnam began at that NSC meeting of Jan 28, when Kennedy stated that he wanted &quot;guerillas to operate in the North&quot;.  All that followed for 13 years was built upon that one simple sentiment expressed by the new president.<br />He wanted guerillas to operate in the North because, as he expressed it in April of that year, &quot;We are opposed around the world by a monolithic and ruthless conspiracy that relies primarily on covert means for expanding its sphere of influence--on infiltration instead of invasion, on subversion instead of elections, on intimidation instead of free choice, on guerillas by night instead of armies by day.&quot; Kennedy was intent on fighting back in kind: infiltrating, subverting, and deploying guerillas by night. <br />Presumably, the CIA would train Vietnamese spies and guerillas and inflict them on the North. But the Bay of Pigs fiasco happened that April, and the Kennedy brothers were convinced the fault for that lay with the CIA. Therefore they gave the job of training and inserting spies and guerillas into North Vietnam to the Pentagon, which had little experience in such operations.<br />There followed a string of failures, where  hundreds of  Vietnamese spies and saboteurs were sent up north, and never heard from again. Or North Vietnamese fishermen would be hauled off to an island and treated to an elaborate charade intended to show them that a revolt against the communist government was imminent. Shultz discusses these attempts in a dispassionate tone, but one gets a growing sense of waste and futility from the narrative. Any of the career espionage people at the CIA could have told Kennedy that it was virtually impossible to plant people in a closed totalitarian society like North Vietnam, even if, as in the case of the CIA, that's your business. But to have the Pentagon take a crack at it? Well, you might as well try to get HUD to send a rocket to the moon.<br />But Kennedy's obsession with and faith in covert action remained unabated till the day of his death. His cabinet, McNamara in particular, shared his enthusiasm. Eventually the Pentagon adopted the attitude that if you want anything done in Vietnam, you have to do it yourself. So covert actions began to include Americans, at the same time the overt effort began ramping up under Johnson.<br />The efforts were redirected toward more practical targets, such as the Ho Chi Minh Trail (the construction of which began in 1959), but the approach was no more practical. This wasn't a &quot;real war&quot;, according to the brightest minds in Washington; it was more of a diplomatic game. Therefore, restrictions had to be placed on the units operating against the trail builders. Special forces could not go beyond 10 kilometers into &quot;neutral&quot; Laos. The North Vietnamese, displaying the practicality and opportunism that became their hallmark, would then route their trail 11 kilometers from the Laos-Vietnam border. Their spies, unlike those of the Pentagon, were quite effective.<br />It wasn't any secret that cutting off the Ho Chi Minh trail would cut off the stream of men and materiel into the South. Shultz quotes Bui Tin, the NVA officer who accepted the surrender of the South in 1975: &quot;If Johnson had granted General Westmoreland's request to enter Laos and block the Ho Chi Minh Trail, Hanoi could not have won the war.&quot; <br />As simple as that. Straight from the lips of an opposing officer. In retrospect, it seems like the logical thing to do: cut off the enemy's supply line. But from its very beginning on January 28, 1961, the Vietnam War was not conducted logically.<br />Perhaps the Kennedy-Johnson crowd's truly wacky ambivalence can best be glimpsed on pages 34-35. Shultz relates how President Kennedy was &quot;stunned&quot; by the images of Buddhist monks immolating themselves in protest of the Diem government's repression. Diem's sister-in-law, who seems to have been a cross between Immelda Marcos and Leona Helmsley, referred to the immolations as &quot;barbecues&quot;. At the same time, South Vietnamese generals were planning a coup. It was dawning on the government of the US that the government of its ally was corrupt and effete and repressive. So where did the Kennedy Administration choose to direct its energies? Toward Hanoi: &quot;escalation of the covert war against Hanoi became a major agenda item. The decision was made to turn up the pressure on the North.&quot; <br />With policy like this being made by the Best and the Brightest, one can only shudder at what a catastrophe we'd have had if our leaders had been merely average.	2001-01-03

The dearth of good books on Mexico makes this one very welcome. It's architecture rests largely on two character portraits: one of Ernesto Zedillo, and the other of the man who calls himself Subcommander Marcos. There is some sketchy material, too, on Carlos Salinas, but it's the type of data that adds to the enigma of the man rather than to our understanding of him. <br />With Zedillo, one can see why two huge accomplishments coincided with his term in office, and went largely unlauded: 1) the payback of the bailout money ahead of time, and 2) the holding of real elections.<br />Oppenheimer shows Zedillo to be honest and smart--unlike many Mexican politicians, his degree from an Ivy League school was not just window dressing; he really is a trained economist. But he was not very popular. As an uncorruptible technocrat, he never would have gotten the nod to be the new president if not for the assassination of Colosio, whose campaign manager he was at the time of the murder. But once he was thrust in by Fate to the number one spot, he proved unusually effective. He was not fashionable or charismatic, and not very well loved by the electorate, which understandably blamed him for the devaluation which occurred at the very beginning of his term. Carlos Salinas was fashionable and charismatic, and there can be little doubt that the conditions necessitating the devaluation accumulated during his term. <br />Even now, with Zedillo gone, those two accomplishments loom over the future more powerfully than anything else that has happened in Mexico for many years.The payback of the bailout money signals that though there may be stumbles on the way to free trade with the US, a quick recovery is possible instead of a long Japanese-style tailspin. The bailout money could have gone into the pockets of well-placed Mexicans, (where now are the millions that the World Bank poured into Russia?) but it did not. I would guess that a lot of credit for that goes to the unfashionably honest Zedillo. <br />The conversion to a truly multiparty system where it is possible for anyone to win also bodes well for the future, both economically and culturally. Mexico could have started having real elections a long time ago, elections that were more than just costly and showy formalities, but it did not. They didn't have a real election until it was time to replace Zedillo. The irony is that a corrupt system put into power an honest man, who then reformed it. <br />The other character that makes this book work is Rafael Guillen, AKA Subcommander Marcos, the leader of the Zapatista uprising, who turns out to be neither an Indian nor a peasant nor even a native of Chiapas, but simply a garden variety marxist from a middle class family in Tampico. An undereducated and underworked lout, he acquired a degree from the National Autonomous University of Mexico with a dissertation on capitalist oppression (what else?). Employing in this dissertation a style reminiscent of the Unabomber, he revealed the family to be the first &quot;unit of oppression&quot;, followed by schools, the second &quot;unit of oppression&quot;, and so on. The only thing that can break this ubiquitous oppression, according to the budding Subcommander, is &quot;proletarian politics&quot;. <br />Oppenheimer doesn't go into how this ideological huckster managed to convince the peasants of Chiapas he could help them--that would be an excellent and highly entertaining book in itself--, but he does show clearly what type of person cooked up the rebellion, which did no good for anyone. In short, it was the kind of person without enough sense to use something other than a ski mask (wool?) to disguise himself in the tropics.<br />By making plain the character of these two men, Oppenheimer adds much to our understanding of what has gone on in Mexico in the last few years. Still, much goes unanswered, such as the actual legality or illegality of the billionaires' banquet, where each of thirty rich men pledged $25 million to the PRI for the election of 1994. Oppenheimer tells of what a scandal there was when the publication El Economista broke the story, but doesn't say whether anyone was prosecuted or even had in fact broken the law. The implication of the secrecy of the banquet and the subsequent scandal, is that there are legal limits on campaign contributions in Mexico, as there are in the US. I'm not sure this is the case.<br />If in fact there are no legal limits, it becomes a question of whether Mexicans in general disapproved of their richest compatriots throwing their financial weight around. It's to Oppenheimer's credit that he notes the alternative to wealthy men giving dizzying sums to the PRI, which is the Mexican government giving dizzying sums to the PRI, which is the way it had been done since the Revolution.<br />Frankly, if I were a Mexican taxpayer, I'd rather the PRI got its money from the billionaires.	2000-12-06

That a 24-year-old could have written it as a first novel I find astonishing. <br />To read it is to glimpse an America with one foot still in the nineteenth century and one placed in the maelstrom that brought the second world war and the welfare state.<br />Cass McCay, the hero, is one of the landless, unlettered, unloved, underfed, lonely drifters of the Depression, what Algren called a Final Descendant of the South, one of the &quot;wild and hardy tribe that had given Jackson and Lincoln birth...slaveless yeomen who had never cared for slaves or land...&quot;  He explains in the Preface:  &quot;Nobody owned a man who owned a gun along the wild frontier. But now that the frontier was gone, where did the man go?&quot;<br />Cass is the offspring of one of those who have nowhere to go. In the Rio Grande valley of West Texas Cass lives in a shack &quot;like a casual box on the border;  wooden and half-accidental&quot; with his brother and sister and father. They live a life about a half step up from that of a family of coyotes, eating only oatmeal or rice for days on end, scrounging coal from halted boxcars, taking turns to go get what the &quot;Relief Station&quot; is giving that week. So one can see how his people spun out of the chaos of the Civil War, still bleeding after 60 years, and drifting toward Franklin Roosevelt's and Lyndon Johnson's way of poverty. His older brother is scarred from a war in France where he was gassed while fighting for something he hadn't the slightest understanding of: &quot;...nobody told nothin' but Jesus-killin' lies. Told us it was dooty to fight fo' this pesthole--told me...Oh, ah didn't believe all they told, none of us did, but we laughed and went anyhow. Now look at me.&quot; <br />Cass spends a lot of time down by the railroad tracks listening to men and boys who ride the rails, dreaming: &quot;Ah'd like to get out of this pesthole someday. Ah'd go to Laredo or Dallas or Tucson.&quot; <br />When his father bludgeons Bryan in the face over some trifle, Cass leaves home without saying goodbye, as one would flee a war or epidemic, and takes to the railroads.    <br />And then he is what Algren called a &quot;Final Descendant&quot;: a rootless anonymity, a &quot;youth alienated from family and faith, illiterate and utterly displaced...a Southerner unable to bear scorn, who had yet born scorn all his days...who wandered through some great city's aimless din, past roar of cab and cabaret, belonging to nothing and nobody.&quot; He pilfers and begs and stares in incomprehension.<br />He is a gentle boy stumbling through a world of unspeakable brutality and cruelty. The &quot;Boots&quot; of the title is a symbol of the men most feared by Cass and his ilk: the railroad bull, the jailer, the cop...Boots are used as weapons and are the mark of authority. But as awful as the booted men are, they are not as bad as the ever-present hunger, the &quot;wolf howling behind your navel&quot;.<br />Today's dispossessed in the US often as not struggle with obesity instead of hunger. &quot;Somebody in Boots&quot; is one of the last chronicles of the struggle with starvation that went on for hundreds of generations, and that is now clearly over. The authoritarianism and brutality and callousness toward pain that Cass endures is unfortunately still with us.	2000-11-06

He quotes Kennedy's inaugural, which included the  pledge to &quot;bear any burden, meet any hardship, support any friend,  oppose any foe to assure the survival and the success of liberty&quot;. In  &quot;Peace With Honor?&quot;, his elegiac second memoir, we see the awful  damage such grandiose promises can wreak.<br />Of course, any of the Cubans  stranded without air support at the Bay of Pigs could have told the  Vietnamese that some burdens were too heavy for the US to bear. Arthur  Schlesinger explains in &quot;A Thousand Days&quot; how JFK didn't want to  turn world opinion against his administration by supporting the invasion.  That was a quick decision. In Richard Shultz' new book he details JFK's  efforts to wage a covert war against Hanoi and still remain within the  boundaries of all the international treaties. In other words, he decided to  stop the North secretly, so as to maintain his honor--a less quick  decision, but a decision all the same.<br />By the time of the fall of Saigon,  the very notion of honor in Vietnam had become a little more than a source  of bitter jokes. &quot;Peace With Honor?&quot; refers to President Nixon's  version of honor in Vietnam, the Paris Peace Agreement. The question mark  is added, I presume, because of the way Hanoi &quot;honored&quot; the  agreement, and the way America enforced it. A ceasefire was declared, the  Americans withdrew, the North regrouped, and attacked, and overran the  South.  &quot;Peace With Honor?&quot; is the final chapter of the tale that  began with the pledge to &quot;bear any burden&quot;.  After fifteen long  years the burden of Vietnam had become too heavy.  A friend had to be  betrayed and abandoned. <br />Herrington is unique in my experience with  writers on Vietnam in that he knows the  language. The Halberstams and the  Karnows and the McNamaras have poured an ocean of words into explanations  and perspectives of the war, but it all seems a little abstract next to  Herrington's personal accounts. I doubt whether you can understand a  culture or its problems, much less solve them, unless you speak to its  people, and you can't speak to its people unless you know their language.  Imagine trying to liberate France from the Nazis with no French speakers on  your team. It could have been done, but would been much harder. Probably  half the people in the Roosevelt administration knew some French. I wonder  whether there was even one person in the Kennedy or Johnson or Nixon  administrations that spoke Vietnamese. <br />&quot;Peace With Honor?&quot;  then, is a portrait of the Vietnamese people, not just the southerners but  those from the north as well, people from Hanoi and Saigon as well as  peasants from the countryside. There is the heart-rending story of an  18-year-old boy drafted and killed in a few days, because his family elects  not to pay off the conscription sergeant.  There is the outrage and  incomprehension of the South Vietnamese who watch the North violate the  ceasefire with impunity and grind ever closer to their home. There is Col.  Herrington's personal account of the evacuation airplane full of babies  that crashed soon after take-off. He arrived to find the plane's fuselage  &quot;twisted and burning in the mud&quot;, and in the field around it  &quot;mud-covered infants strewn everywhere --some of them ashen-faced and  quiet, others screaming in pain or fright&quot;. It would take the heart of  a communist to view such a scene as a propaganda opportunity, and indeed  that's what it became, with Hanoi's representatives claiming that the  Americans were taking Vietnamese children to concentration camps.<br />One  gets the impression from his conversations with North Vietnamese that they  believed their own propaganda: an NVA Major insists Hanoi was bombed into  rubble and that the socialist masses rebuilt the city, employing, according  to Herrington, sophisticated aging techniques to make the buildings appear  seventy years old. Another NVA Major tries to explain away the mass graves  of civilians slaughtered in the city of Hue after it was taken during the  Tet Offensive by saying they were caught in a crossfire. Herrington asks  him whether he finds it unusual that the civilians had their hands tied  behind their backs during the &quot;crossfire&quot;.<br />The final third of  the book finds Herrington struggling to evacuate as many people as he can  from the collapsing Saigon. As for anyone who has come to know and love a  culture, it was extremely painful for him to see it sacked. He spent a lot  of time reassuring panic-stricken people that they would not be left behind  to be reeducated or murdered. We Americans tend to view conflicts as  presenting two options: stay and fight; or turn and run. But for the  Saigonese in 1975 there was nowhere to run. In Cambodia, the only nearby  country, the communists were arranging an even more efficient solution to  the class enemy problem. Running in all other directions brought you to the  sea.<br />So there was extreme terror and desperation.  Near the end of the  evacuation Herrington receives and obeys orders to leave on the final  helicopter, though  420 people who have been assured of safe passage are  still waiting on the embassy stairway. For the people of Vietnam this  helicopter that never comes is the final betrayal.<br />I was reminded of the  words of a novel that had been written a half a century before the war:  &quot;They were careless people, Tom and Daisy--they smashed up things and  creatures and then retreated back into their money or their vast  carelessness, or whatever it was that kept them together, and let other  people clean up the mess they had made...&quot;	2000-08-23
US	52767766	RY7PHN5S54BFM	0679768122	381866424	Albert Speer: His Battle with Truth	Books	5	29	30	N	N	Engrossing	While it is intriguing to speculate whether Speer knew or did not know about the extermination of the Jews, that is only the smallest part of this  vast work of scholarship. Gitta Sereny came to the conclusion that Speer  was neither moral nor immoral, but rather &quot;morally extinguished&quot;.  That is a somewhat ambiguous term, but from what I read in Speer's books  and from what Sereny reveals in this one, I take it to mean something  fairly simple: Speer was aware of people being imprisoned and killed, but  really didn't pay much attention because he was too busy with his  career.<br />He noticed Jews being lined up at the Berlin train station to be  taken somewhere; he didn't have the inclination or the time to find out why  or where. He noticed that his boss had started a war; he was too busy to  wonder whether the war was justified--he was an architect and any number of  projects had to be attended to. His boss ordered him to assume leadership  of armaments production for the war; refusing the order was not an option.  He discovered that armaments production was accomplished largely by slaves,  who died in great numbers at their work.  Perhaps he heard of work areas  where very little work was done and very, very large numbers of people  died, of causes unrelated to work. Perhaps he did not. Sereny's book is  largely a probe into whether he knew about the extermination camps or  not.<br />Of his repentance after the war there can be little doubt. He  quarrels in Spandau with the other Nazis over whether they did anything  wrong. He is mocked by one of his closest former Nazi friends for his  &quot;public mea culpas&quot;. He speaks with a chaplain in Spandau about  his desire to make himself a &quot;different man&quot;. He exchanges  letters with Rabbi Robert Geis, a tremendously moving encounter--the Jew  forgiving the Nazi. Just the fact that he would sit down for numerous  interviews with Sereny, an author of books on death camps, speaks of his  consciousness of the crimes he was associated with, and his desire to  confront them.<br />What I found most compelling was the glimpse Sereny's  interviews afford us into a society that had gone completely over the edge,  taking not just soldiers and guards and politicians, but also a great many  children. It's easy to forget that many of these murderers had families.  Speer had five children. Goebbels had six, all given names beginning with  H. There is a photo in the book showing a number of these children arranged  around Adolf Hitler on his birthday. Speer himself was a very young man  when he first came under the spell of Hitler.<br />In following the thread of  her investigation into Speer, Sereny arrives at Posen Castle, October 6,  1943, where Himmler is addressing an assembly of gauleiters:   &quot;...think for a moment how many party comrades have addressed one of  those petitions to us in which was written that of course all Jews are  pigs, but so-and-so is a decent Jew who should be exempted...I daresay that  according to the number of such petitions...there must have been more decent  Jews in Germany than there were Jews altogether...each of you, in your own  province, knows good respectable National Socialists, each of whom knows  one decent Jew...&quot;<br />The irony is really remarkable if you stop to think  about it: the minister in charge of genocide complaining that he is  overwhelmed with requests from Nazis to spare Jews. He goes on to say how  he made the difficult decision to kill not just the men, but also the women  and children, and congratulates himself on his foresight: &quot;I did not  think I was justified in exterminating the men, but to leave their children  to grow up and take revenge on our sons and grandchildren.&quot;  The bland  and practical tone is that of a civil engineer: I did not think I should  put a sidewalk there because that would not leave enough space for the cars  to park. <br />He continues, slipping into the stilted anddelusional diction  that is more common to Nazi speech: &quot;This order was the most difficult  one we were ever given...I think I can say that it has been carried out  without damaging the minds or spirits of our men. The danger was great and  ever present.&quot; (Of what? Of damage to the spirit?) &quot;...the  difference between the two possibilities...to become cruel and heartless and  no longer to respect human life, or to become soft and succumb to weakness  and nervous breakdowns...the way between Scylla and Charybdis is appallingly  narrow.&quot; <br />One wonders if that would have been Himmler's defense had  he survived to Nuremberg: &quot;I exterminated the Jews in order to keep  myself from having a nervous breakdown.&quot; Here is what is at the heart  of my fascination with Albert Speer: unlike Himmler and Goebbels and the  rest, he was not a lunatic. Sereny includes this passage from Posen Castle  because there is an unresolved question as to whether Speer was present   for Himmler's speech, and hence informed of the policy of genocide. But I  don't think it matters. Speer was accessory to so many monstrous crimes  that his knowledge or ignorance of the most monstrous one becomes moot.  <br />The more interesting question is how a man with the capacity for  technical brilliance and decency and remorse, and a host of the other  attributes that are best in mankind, could be a party to, and indeed a  powerful engine of, one of the humanity's most ghastly episodes. This book  doesn't entirely answer that question--no book could--but it is an  absorbing and engrossing effort toward doing so.	2000-08-20
US	52767766	R13Q385LBFOCXU	0425143570	188969850	Thunder Point (Sean Dillon)	Books	5	7	11	N	N	Bottoms Up!	This is the finest book about drinking I've ever seen. With every action, or conversation, emotion, or other thing of interest,  a drink is enjoyed  by the characters. Recent studies have shown that a good drink will  noticeably improve the dramatic quality of a story. That is quite evident  in Thunder Point, whose 320 pages are enhanced with no less than 87 glasses  of various types of beer, wine, and spirituous liquor. That is an average  of one every 3.5 pages! If only real life could be so liquid!<br />There is an  amusing subplot about a U-boat wreck in the waters off the Virgin Islands,  but the real action is where the booze is. And I would caution readers new  to Higgins that not just action is denoted by the approach of the  bartender. Characterizations are also neatly done by the bottle, so to  speak. The hero, Sean Dillon, is Irish, but he loves champagne. This  renders him romantic, and not a little enigmatic. This is not to say he  won't drink other things such as Irish whiskey or even scotch, but the core  of his personality is built by champagne. Would you believe he even goes  for a bit of brandy after a dive in the cold ocean?<br />Also, the impeccably  correct English brigadier who runs covert operations for England prefers  scotch, but by the end of the tale he has begun to unbend to the extent  that he starts to enjoy champagne, too, seemingly as much as Dillon! I hope  it won't be considered a spoiler to relate that while in the first half of  the book scotch is running neck and neck with champagne for frequency of  mention, by the end champagne has outstripped scotch by 23 glasses--39 to  16. This is in keeping with the generally celebratory and joyous tone of  the work. <br />It's a testimony to Higgins' considerable skill as a writer  that in the last thirty pages when the characters' drinking falls off, he  neatly picks up the slack with mayhem. And the author has clearly done his  homework in this department. Not only do the villains kill everyone who  knows anything about the submarine, just as they do in real life, so too do  the agents of Her Majesty kill everyone who knows anything about the  villains. Is it just coincidence that this is how it happens in Hollywood?  I don't think so. I think Mr. Higgins has access to the highest levels of  government, which in turn are tutored by the sages of Los Angeles. And this  is fitting. For years and years Hollywood has been telling us that any  problem can be solved with a gun. The box office figures show that they are  right. When will people listen?<br />Not only that, but this recent trend  toward not smoking and toward accusing smokers of being not romantic is  utterly demolished by Sean Dillon. He has a special lighter called a Zippo,  and when he uses it to light one of his cigarettes (I'm not sure which  brand he likes best, but a champagne called Krug is his favorite champagne)  you just know something cool is going to happen. For example, when one of  the evil men who is in on the plot to get a briefcase out of the submarine  thinks he is going to escape punishment, Dillon is right on the scene and  his arrival is heralded by the Zippo. Get this: the Zippo is turned on not  to light Dillon's own cigarette, but the evil man's! Then Dillon disposes  of the evil man.<br />Don't be turned off by the idea that this is all about  scotch and champagne. Beer and wine play an important part, and there is a  healthy amount of gin as well. The vodka lovers among you will have to wait  until Dillon goes to Russia to sort out some problem there. And if tequila  is your favorite, take heart. While there are no references to tequila in  Thunder Point, the Virgin Islands are not far from Mexico. Not far at all.  Maybe Higgins will send Dillon, Zippo flaring, to the cantinas of Chiapas  to work with Subcommandant Marcos to solve that troublesome situation.	2000-08-06

For several years now I've watched references in various newspapers to see how Al Sharpton is portrayed. In general, the references are negative. He is called a racist, a demagogue, a hate-monger, a rabble-rouser, a  charlatan, and opportunist...I never saw any column or article that spoke  well of him, so I was pleased to find he had this book out, which tells his  side of the story.<br />It seems to me he's gotten a bad rap. His fame comes  mainly out of the Howard Beach and Bensonhurst murders and the Tawana  Brawley affair. In the Brawley affair he apparently was duped.  In Howard  Beach and Bensonhurst his actions were, in my view, exemplary and  necessary. <br />Compare the aftermath of the Rodney King verdict in LA to the  aftermath of Howard Beach. In LA they had a massive riot. In Howard Beach  Reverend Sharpton led a series of peaceful protest marches. It's not  farfetched to suggest that a riot could have occurred after Howard Beach.  Instead, Sharpton organized marches in the best tradition of nonviolent  protest.<br />Even if Michael Griffith had not been chased out onto the Belt  Parkway and struck by a car and killed, the protest marches would have been  justified. The reason he was chased was that his car broke down in a  neighborhood where the inhabitants had the peculiar idea that they were  entitled to decide who could come into their neighborhood, and who could  not. It was &quot;their turf &quot;. The same was true of Bensonhurst. The  people of Bensonhurst had the idea, supported by years of official  acquiescence, that they were entitled to keep blacks out of their  neighborhood.<br />In the South forty years ago that was known as segregation,  and people deliberately marched and rode in the front of busses and drank  from water fountains to put a stop to it. In New York in the eighties it  didn't go by the name of segregation and it wasn't written into the city  charter, but it was by and large the same thing. Sharpton could have  incited a riot, or given his tacit blessing to the people who are always  ready to go that route. Instead, and to his credit, he chose the tactics of  Martin Luther King, Jr.<br />Sharpton rightly points out that New York liberal  Democrats don't like to be compared to Dixiecrats, but none of the  Democrats in power at the time helped him break down the racial barriers:  not Mayor Koch; not Governor Cuomo. They could have helped him take the  first steps in the desegregation of Howard Beach and Bensonhurst, but they  chose not to, preferring instead a comfortable (for them) status quo.<br />On  the other hand, Rev. Sharpton is completely inaccurate in suggesting the  &quot;rage&quot; of the Howard Beach racists was built up by Ronald Reagan  and George Bush. In an otherwise well-written and thoughtful book, he  claims that Republicans have been &quot;telling white folks that the reason  the country doesn't work is blacks...&quot;Why are your taxes so high?  Blacks. They're all on welfare and their bankrupting us. Why is there so  much unemployment in Howard Beach? Why can't the young people get  meaningful work? Blacks.&quot;&quot; In a single paragraph he unjustly  smears his political enemies in the same way  the media smears him. Neither  Reagan nor Bush ever blamed the woes of the country on blacks nor advocated  violence or hatred, just as Rev. Sharpton never advocated violence or  hatred. Nothing useful can come of any of these hyperbolic accusations. In  fact, there are more than a few similarities in the way Reagan and Sharpton  got into the face of the liberal establishment to force change.<br />In  addition to all the political wrangling, Go and Tell Pharaoh is a story of  an interesting man. One can't help but admire a child who began preaching  Christianity at the age of four, at a time when so many other  four-year-olds were content to watch Captain Kangaroo. Perhaps more  remarkable is that he kept at it five years later when a great tragedy  struck his family. Like his unusual hair, and the touching story behind it,  there is more to Al Sharpton than meets the eye. This book is a closer  look.	2000-07-23

The breadth of historical and political research is reminiscent of Robert Caro. The delivery and pacing is Scorcesian. The attention to details of method (such as a team of  detectives practicing for weeks the speedy dismantling of a Jaguar's dashn  order to plant a bug) brings to mind Stuart Herrington's book on spy  catching.<br />Beyond all the above, what I liked most about Gangbusters was  the way it gives the lie to the Hollywood version of the mafia. Ever since  Puzo hit the jackpot in the seventies, writers and filmmakers have given us  progressively more romantic and glamorous versions of ever more despicable  acts by the mob, almost as though its lawbreaking was exempt from social  condemnation because it was a part of their culture, and therefore  valuable. In this worldview, Thomas Dewey is a martinet and Gaetano  Lucchese a pillar of society. Rudolf Giuliani is a fanatical fascist and  Sam Gravano a courageous hero. The CIA and FBI are evil conspiracies, while  the Cosa Nostra is a benevolent organization devoted to helping the working  guy.<br />Gangbusters demolishes these ridiculous social myths in many ways,  probably the most powerful being the story of Jerry Kubecka, a simple man  with the modest aspiration of running a garbage hauling business on Long  Island. Refusing to pay off the mafia thugs who demanded control of his  business, Kubecka let himself in for decades of  vandalism and violence,  that only ended after his son had been murdered. <br />The political powers in  New York and elsewhere looked the other way for decades. Special sections  were set up in prisons for mobsters to pass away nominal sentences in  luxury. As early as the thirties J. Edgar Hoover was saying there was no  such thing as the mafia. As late as 1986 Mario Cuomo was saying in the New  York Times that there was no such thing as the mafia. Volkman skillfully  tells the story of the people who exposed and put a stop to these monstrouspublic lies, and the vast crimes they were intended to conceal.	2000-07-20

Richardson goes over his impoverished youth in Texas, and his stunning rise in  California, but doesn't go very far into how it occurred. For example,  Brown was said to be an intellectual, a voracious reader in his youth.  Richardson says virtually nothing about WHAT Brown read. We learn nothing  of the thinkers or writers Brown admired. Nothing is said about his work  habits, his passions, his view of history, the kind of society he would  like to shape. <br />Over and over we are told of Brown's love of beautiful  women, his &quot;flamboyance&quot;, his expensive tastes. But who among us  does not love beautiful women? And what, precisely, makes wearing an  expensive suit flamboyant? If an expensive suit is flamboyant, then George  Bush and Lloyd Bentsen must be flamboyant.<br />Is it not important to know  what a politician thinks, in addition to what he wears and drives?	2000-07-13

Dealing with only one borough enables the author to go into more detail  while reducing the size of the book. The AIA Guide is about half the size  of a large yellow pages. The Architectural Guidebook to NYC is about the  size of an average novel. That makes a big difference when you're stuffing  it into your backpack or purse for a trip on subway or foot.<br />The more  extensive entries are very welcome. In Union Square with this book and a  view of the surrounding buildings, I was able to spend a pleasant and  informative hour on a park bench, for free. That's a better bargain than  the Staten Island Ferry.<br />Morrone keeps the architect's jargon to a  minimum and knows his subject well. The historical insights and views on  clashing aesthetics were skillfully presented. He pointed out a couple of  museums of very high caliber that I wasn't even aware of. A book like this  is a perfect jumping off point for thousands of topics, from neighborhoods  to cultures to politics to construction.<br />I would encourage him to write  similar books on the other buroughs, or better yet, an even more detailed  work on each of the neighborhoods of Manhattan: each of them has at least a  thousand buildings worth writing about.	2000-07-07

This freezing  of resources will bankrupt welfare states, and enhance diseconomies to  scale that are undermining large governments and all institutions  subsidized by large governments.&quot;<br />Ah-ha! Apparently it has not been  decided yet whether to &quot;free&quot; or &quot;freeze&quot; the resources  of the world. If somehow the Information Elite can be persuaded (not  coerced!) into taking the latter course, then there just might be a way to  keep the resources from being encrypted. You see, with global warming, it'sgoing to be hard to keep a carton of peas frozen for very long, much less  all the non-pea assets of the world.<br />We are indebted to the authors for  giving us this freeing/freezing hint to preserve our way of life for a few  more years.	2000-06-27

The exploits are of a kind I would never attempt, and just the contemplation of them makes me at once weary and exhilarated. <br />In the  early seventies the author resolved to kayak down one of the most  forbidding rivers in the world: the Apurimac in Peru. In two trips, in 1974  and 1975, he did just that. The Apurimac is the longest tributary and hence  considered the source of, the Amazon (River). It is forbidding due to the  extreme ferocity of its cataracts, and also due to the fact that in many  places along its course climbing out of its canyon or going back upstream  would be impossible. Thus, the discovery by Giddings and his companions of  a scenic forty or fifty foot waterfall on the unexplored sections could  well have been a death sentence.<br />While all the kayakers did make it out  alive, things were not always hunky-dory between them. Giddings comments  frequently on his team's lack of teamwork and his submerged tensions.  Reading this a quarter century later, I felt he could be right or maybe  wrong, but I had almost nothing by which to draw any conclusions. The  author gives only the most cursory description of the other members of his  party (5 besides himself), then launches into the chronicle. This  information deficit is never cured. We are not told the age, the religion,  the education, the job, the background, the biases--nothing  of any of  these five other men on the journey, which makes it impossible to become  involved as a reader in the psycho-drama that seems to have played out on  the river. One cannot even attempt some judgement based solely on  appearance because although the book has many photos, it lacks a portrait  of the group, which one would think basic in a work of this kind. The  reader can only glimpse three of the five members in individual  pictures.<br />So the question remains. Were they really a band of males of  the stand-up comedy stereotype:egotistical, enamored of tools and  technological playthings, but unable to talk about their feelings round the  campfire or work together as a unit on the river? Were they even aware of  any potential for their expedition to turn into a disaster of the kind  portrayed in the movie Deliverance (a hit of that era)or the more recent  catastrophes on Everest? Or is there another side to the story that  Giddings chose for one reason or another not to reveal?	2000-06-21

The letter(s) ll is said to be pronounced like the lli in  million or like j in Latin America. But in over a quarter century of travel  in Central and South America, as well as in conversations with Spanish  speakers in the US, I have never yet heard anyone say &quot;Como te  liamas?&quot; instead of &quot;Como te yamas?&quot;<br />Should you be  planning a climb in the Andes, you can find the words for cairn and  crampon, but you'll have to look elsewhere for carabiner and gabion  (neither of which the MS dictionary recognizes). Considering all the  Mexicans working in the US construction industry, you'd think the editors  would include words for a wooden stud or 2-by-4, but they don't. A large  percentage of these guest craftsmen specialize in concrete work, but Harper  Collins doesn't have a listing for rebar. And whether you're using a  carpentry tool or a networking device, you won't find the Spanish word for  router.  <br />Going for a hike in the desert of northern Mexico? Ask a doctor  before you go what the word for antivenin is, because though it seems like  a pretty important word, especially to someone who's just been bit by a  serpiente de cascabel, it's not in this book. <br />It may sound like I'm  finding fault with Harper Collins, but I'm not. I sincerely admire this  dictionary and these are instances in which it could be made even better.  An email address on the back cover could get these and other useful notes  to the editors pronto.	2000-06-06
US	52767766	RHVFG4SAIRRJ7	1555912354	643792626	Trails across America: Traveler's Guide to Our National Scenic and Historic Trails	Books	5	6	6	N	N	So good, they ought to do this for other countries.	Just a cursory reading of Trails has its rewards. You might be on a trip almost anywhere in the US and pick it up to find a spot nearby of scenic or historic interest. But this book is unusual among travel and trail guides  in that it is also a pleasure simply to read straight through at home in  your comfy chair. The authors supply loads of information and are  enthusiastic about their subjects without succumbing to the Everything Is  Beautiful disease that travel writers are generally prone to.<br />The  historic trail sections are especially strong. They link Mormon, Spanish,  American Indian, English colonial, and pioneer history to the actual  physical places where it occurred. For example, at the end of the Juan  Bautista de Anza trail, the city of San Francisco was founded around the  month of July, 1776. Another trail, the California National Historic Trail,  is the route(s) of the English speaking pioneers who came in later years to  take San Francisco and the rest of California away from the Spaniards and  their descendents. On the Nez Perce and Trail of Tears historic trails you  can see two of the routes followed by the aboriginal peoples who were  driven from their homes by the dueling European powers, and also by poor  pioneers who oftentimes had been themselves driven from their homes across  the ocean.<br />The maps at the beginning of each chapter are clear and  well-detailed. All in all, you could hardly ask for a better travelling  companion if you're going on a car trip, particularly if you're going with  children who have even the mildest interest in learning things.	2000-05-22

This is a superbly written book, probably the result of theauthor's having toiled for years in the salt mines of fictionwriting. Leafing through it for the first time, I found every passage I chanced upon to be a delight, such as this one on p.37:<br /> &quot;Americans essay to cure their homesickness with costly visits to Disneyworld. The crude, ineffective palliatives they get there in the form of brass bands and choochoo train rides leave them more homesick and more baffled as to the nature of their disease than when they arrived--like selling chocolate bars to someone suffering from scurvy...&quot;<br />Our homesickness, which is Kunstler's theme, stems from having destroyed our home, or a large part of it anyway. The homesickness is the spiritual devastation that follows the trashing of a beautiful country, the grand hotel razed to make way for an eyesore of a shopping center, the neighborhood raped by a freeway, the suburban children that know nothing of the city and nothing of the country--nothing at all in fact, except how to make a purchase at a fast food franchise. That is the &quot;Nowhere&quot; of the title. &quot;Home From&quot; refers to Kunstler's and the New Urbanists' proposed remedy. <br />I've seen this topic touched on before, but never so elegantly nor so bluntly. Strip malls and tract housing are dismissed as &quot;dreck&quot; and &quot;blight&quot; and &quot;piece(s) of junk&quot;... The landscape in which all is subjugated to the car is described variously as &quot;wasteland&quot;, &quot;crudscape&quot;, &quot;rubbish&quot;...The people inhabiting this nowhere are no longer citizens, but consumers. Trips through this nowhere are to be endured rather than enjoyed.<br />From a succinct history of how we got into the mess, to a quick outline of the New Urbanist philosophy, to dozens of real scenarios around the country illustrating what he means, Kunstler's volume packs a punch. Before this, I had found only unsatisfying and glancing treatmentsof this topic in such works as &quot;Crabgrass Frontier&quot; and Trow's &quot;In the Context of No Context&quot;.<br />This is not to say I agree with all of the proposed solutions. Main Street, &quot;outdoor room&quot;, ma and pa shops? No thanks. Main Streets give me a Mayberry RFD feeling that makes me want to emigrate. And Ma and Pa were always understocked and overpriced. It's not their fault: supplying an industrial society is too big a job for an old married couple. That's why the big box store is here to stay (at least for a few years).<br />But the big box does not have to be ugly, and it doesn't have to be segregated from the society it serves. I think Kunstler is right on the money with his indictment of single use zoning. He and the New Urbanists propose building apartments over commercial buildings. He'd probably laugh me to scorn at the very mention, but I think it would be great to put apartments and condominiums over big boxes.<br />The average Home Depot could have 20 units superimposed on it. A central courtyard on this second story with a restaurant or two and an internet café would create a hotel-like atmosphere. The Depot would reserve a couple units as demonstration models, and the rest would be rented to those people who, for one reason or another, don't wish to buy a single family house: college students, Depot employees, gay divorcees, foreigners--the perfect recipe for a yeasty cosmopolitan enclave, the presence of which almost always drives up property values. <br />Complete the picture with a rooftop garden of the sort so eloquently described in the writings of Dixie Lee Ray, and you have a new paradigm of development...or perhaps a return to an ancient and trusty paradigm: the market town.	2000-05-17

I have a moderate understanding of how things work, but I am woefully undereducated in the  scientific principles that underlie those workings. The New Way Things Work  gives both: nuts-and-bolts explanations of things and succinct discussion  of the underlying principles--and abundant links to go between the  two.<br />There are timelines of machines and their inventions, as well as  their inventors. Each machine has a page with a clear picture with the  working parts labeled, and sometimes a short animation to further clarify  the machine's action. There is a testing feature which is useful, if a bit  humbling. The &quot;Research Answer&quot; button posted tantalizingly right  at the bottom of each test question is a spur to further research, though I  worry about the ethical implications. Does that mammoth think I'm cheating?  Does that guy with the mustache and mannerisms of Martin Mull keep track of  how many times I &quot;research&quot; an answer, and does that go on my  permanent record? Perhaps there should be an on/off toggle. <br />The links on  each machine page to the principles and inventors and vice versa may be  where the CD has an advantage over a book, particularly for children. When  I'm explaining something to my daughter and she doesn't understand part of  the explanation, she wants that missing piece Right Now, and the hot links  provide that immediacy. Paging to another part of a book and then loosing  her original place frustrates her. That never happens with this CD, because  she knows she can always hit the BACK button. It would be even better if  there were a FORWARD button like on a browser, because children quickly  understand this navigational technique and use it frequently. I notice they  pick up and leave off and go back and forth and generally become more  involved than with a book.<br />I was disappointed that the Tele-Prompter was  not one of the machines featured. Like others in the television audience in  the 1980s, I gaped in wonder as politicians gave huge speeches to live  audiences without glancing at their notes. I assumed the glass plates to  the right and left of the speaker were security devices to block bullets  and flying tomatoes. Also, it would be nice to know how a polygraph works,  and whether the polygraph could be combined with a Tele-Prompter to make a  more complete machine--what surveyors call a &quot;total  station&quot;.<br />The timelines are also quite valuable. You feel better  about your own limited understanding of practical things by contemplating  such facts as the toilet tank being  invented by a contemporary of  Shakespeare. And frankly, I think that article could do with a little  expansion: where did the flow of water go after it traveled from the newly  invented tank of Elizabeth the First's godson? The street outside his  window? The River Thames?  I know that through my childhood and right up  until the time I bought a house I believed that wastes were carried away in  pipes in a method involving electricity.<br />Ever since capsizing a sunfish  in 1977, I've  wondered how sailboats can be propelled by wind blowing from  behind them, and by wind blowing directly into your face as you stand on  the deck and gaze at your destination. New Way Things Work provides the  answer.   Another device it would be interesting to know about is carbon  dating and the newer, more accurate (I'm told) argon-argon dating. I want  to know the age of the rocks in my back yard. And why haven't we Americans  been provided with small, affordable, personal flying devices yet? These  and other questions naturally come up; like all good educational tools,  this CD raises as many questions as it answers.	2000-05-12
US	52767766	R1959H3VWLGX4Y	0316774707	318063863	Many Are the Crimes: McCarthyism in America	Books	3	19	45	N	N	Have you no sense, Madam, at long last? Have you no sense?	Like the best dust jackets, that of &quot;Many Are The Crimes&quot; neatly gives the gist of the book. The anti-Communist movement, which often goes by the name McCarthyism, was, &quot;generally accurate in (its)  accusations&quot; but, &quot;exaggerated the danger of Communism&quot; and  was responsible for the &quot;most widespread episode of political  repression in the history of the US&quot;.<br />Here is laid bare one of  life's mysteries: the left wing's enduring sympathy and empathy for one of  the most brutal and repressive and hate-filled ideologies in history.  Seemingly, nothing is enough to justify prosecuting the communist crowd.  Not even when mass murder is carried out against their own kind. No act is  too atrocious to be rationalized.  The author quotes an American Communist  who saw several friends disappear in Moscow in the Thirties,  accepting it  &quot;as part of the brutal realities of making a revolution, of building  an oasis of socialism in a sea of enemies&quot;. This attitude, this  craven, nauseating rationalization Schrecker deems  &quot;tough-mindedness&quot;. One wonders how it would go over with Ms.  Schrecker's chums at Yeshiva University if she were to call  &quot;tough-minded&quot; the condoning of purges in Berlin in the  Thirties-- &quot;part of the brutal realities of making a revolution, of  building an oasis of Aryanism in a sea of enemies&quot;. <br />In the same  spirit, Ms. Schrecker ascribes Stalin's pact with Hitler to Stalin's being  &quot;disillusioned by the Western democracies failure to stand up to  Hitler&quot; (p.15). Well! We all must lose our innocence some time. But  this must have been a particularly shattering realization for Stalin.  Imagine the depth of his disillusionment upon realizing that he'd have to  share the butchery of the next 20 million people with the hated foreigners.  <br />Usually communist sympathizers are blissfully ignorant of what  communists are all about right up to the moment when thejack-booted  baboons bang on their door in the middle of the night and haul them off to  a labor camp in order to build oases of socialism in a sea of etc, etc... Not  Schrecker. She is fully informed of the atrocities of the Reds of the  world.<br />Fully informed, she chooses to overlook these shortcomings in  order to examine how the ideology was &quot;repressed&quot;. Unlike Joe  Stalin, Schrecker is under no illusions. She details the essentially  autocratic, rigid, self-righteous nature of the CP. She elucidates in  energetic, trim prose the growing of the movement against the CP, not just  by narrow-minded xenophobic whitebread males like those pictured on the  dust jacket, but by socialists, labor leaders, and liberals of the  Roosevelt and Truman administrations.  <br />Yet throughout this meticulous  account runs the whisper: &quot;the anti-communists exaggerated the danger  of communism&quot;. Thus, while acknowledging the guilt of the Rosenbergs,  she refers to their case as &quot;judicial murder&quot;. While  acknowledging the chronic mendacity of the CP, she is indignant that its  followers should be imprisoned for perjury or contempt of Congress.  Although communists subjugated half the population of the globe in a short  span of years, she clings to the notion that it could not happen in  America. <br />Schrecker willfully ignores the set and setting of  anti-communism in order to smear the movement.  Russia had completed two  decades of mass murder. Mao had just subjugated China and was just  beginning his decades of mass murder. North Korea invaded South Korea--not  a civil conflict, but a crude bid for conquest. Millions died, families  were destroyed, businesses were gutted, people were enslaved. <br />Meanwhile,  Ellen Schrecker's sixth grade teacher lost his job for a couple years.  Dalton Trumbo had to write under a pseudonym for awhile. A handful of  people were called in front of a Congressional Committee to answer  questions about their politics. This is Ms. Schrecker's conception of  repression: the horror of answering the pointed questions of Richard Nixon,  Robert Kennedy, Joseph McCarthy, and other politicians who happened to  serve on the House UnAmerican Activities Committee. <br />In a note to her  Introduction, Schrecker notes that Stalin was &quot;more repressive&quot;  than McCarthy--thus suggesting that both were guilty of &quot;crimes&quot;,  with no word of the incomprehensible enormity of the one and the paltriness  of the other. One might as well compare the Columbine massacre to a panty  raid. <br />Incredibly enough, she runs this litany out to book length. It  goes like this: Stalin was guilty of crimes, but that was in Russia, and  this book is about America. Here in America, communists were not bad. They  were compassionate folk: labor organizers and civil rights activists. In  foreign countries evil communists took control from the good communists.  That couldn't happen in America. No way a Stalin or a Lenin or a Mao or a  Pol Pot or a Castro could ever come to power in the USA. It's mere  coincidence that every other communist regime in the world turned into a  totalitarian bloodbath. The real danger in America was J. Edgar Hoover and  his lists. <br />The climax of this symphony of equivocation finds Schrecker,  in the petulant tone of a thwarted child, blaming anti-communism for  everything from lousy TV programming to Watergate. I must say, she retained  my interest to the very end. I've never seen a more perfect example of how  a highly intelligent person can be so completely and consistently  deluded.<br />She would make a more serious contribution to history if in her  next book she were to examine how communism has evolved from the dream of a  control freak to something more closely resembling the Cosa Nostra. If and  when the RICO statute is adapted to international law in order to crush  organized crime in Russia and China, as it has been crushed here in the US,  Schrecker would be the perfect chronicler, with her eye for the nuances of  repression.	2000-04-04
US	52767766	R28AQRG632OP57	0940672596	428978633	The Roads of Colorado	Books	5	15	15	N	N	Marvelous	This is an outstanding achievement and service to the map readers of this world. &quot;Roads of Colorado&quot; combines the topographical data of the DeLorme Atlases with the legal status info of US Forest Service maps. The  happy result is that one no longer has to keep bouncing back and forth  between the two types of map and reorienting oneself every time. It's all  here in one atlas the size of a Rand McNally. The scale is 1:158,400, a  little better than the DeLorme series. The legal status is portrayed in  colors: pink for incorporated cities; green for national forest; darker  green for wilderness areas; pale yellow for deeded land; darker yellow for  state land; light blue for BLM; darker blue for national parks. Of course,  this means that woods can't be shown, as on a regular topo, but that's a  minor drawback when you consider their ever-changing boundaries due to fire  and logging and new growth.<br />The accuracy and comprehensiveness of the  road and trail depiction is a delight. I have walked and driven many miles  in Colorado, and I can see at a glance that this atlas would have saved me  a lot of time and effort wasted getting stuck in the mud and arriving at  locked gates. <br />It's not only useful for hikers and tourists, however. The  legal status information is a godsend when you're investigating or  investing in real estate. It's also fascinating to see which towns are  incorporated and which aren't, and their boundaries. Often, the former are  much smaller than the latter.<br />This work of art could scarcely be improved  upon, but if I were asked to do so, I would put latitudinal and  longitudinal coordinates on the edges of the maps for GPS usage. (Not a  grid on the map itself; that would clutter it up.) Also, certain  incorporated towns are not shown because they were incorporated decades ago  and no one lives there any more. It would be fascinating to see such towns  in pink, both from an historical and an investor's point of view. One such  town is Bare Hills City, a Victorian mining town that had over a thousand  people living in it in 1905. It would be on p.104 about 5 miles northwest  of Red Canyon Park.<br />I sincerely hope Shearer Publishing does the same  thing for all the states, starting with the western ones. I saw their  &quot;Roads of New Mexico&quot;, and it doesn't even come close to the  Colorado atlas for clarity and beauty. Great advances in cartography must  have been made at Shearer between the publishing of one and the other.	2000-01-11
US	52767766	R3BP9OMXRRXC8R	0060977698	618183361	Legends of the American Desert: Sojourns in the Greater Southwest	Books	4	7	7	N	N	Great raw material; needs more processing.	At the end of &quot;Legends&quot; Alex Shoumatoff mentions that the book had 8 editors in the course of its making.  Nine must have been the magic number, for I've rarely seen a book published in sloppier form.  Misspellings, typos, convoluted grammar, dates flung hither and thither  without the slightest regard for accuracy... on p.35 he implies that  Teotihuacan was built over 5000 years ago and that corn from this culture  reached what is now known as New Mexico by &quot;3600&quot;. I enclose that  in quotes because he doesn't specify whether he means before the present or  before Christ. Either way, it's a long time before Teotihuacan was built.  <br />Pre-Columbian history is one of my favorite topics, so I pushed on in  spite of this blundering. But on p.45 he pranced right into another pet  peeve of mine, the reporting of populations of continents that had no  census bureaus. He states the population of the Americas to be  &quot;fourteen million or so&quot;, at the time of Columbus'  &quot;discovery&quot;. The quotes around discovery are his, meant to  display his politically correct Aboriginal American point of view.  Unfortunately, if you're going to go down that road, you have to call it  something other than America, because Amerigo Vespucci was European and if  the Europeans didn't discover it, they certainly have no right to name  it.<br />Editor #9 should place the word &quot;guess&quot; somewhere before  the fourteen million. Then he or she should flip forward to p.76 where it  is stated that the population in Mexico at the time of the conquest was  thirty million. Not the Americas, just Mexico. If we can assume that  Mexico's share of the 14 million in 1492 was 5 million, and that in just 27  years it swelled to 30 million, then Alex Shoumatoff has  &quot;discovered&quot; the greatest pre-war baby boom in history! At the  close of the fifteenth century the Mexicans were adding almost a million  babies a year! Before the advent of Catholicism!<br />Granted, some latitude  must be given when the title of a book is Legends, but perhaps Shoumatoff  should give some little signal (such as italicization) when he's about to  take off on his magic carpet to La-La Land. Of course, that still wouldn't  give much cover to such egregious blunders as that of the snow snakes on  p.44: &quot;...perhaps eleven thousand years ago, the Bering Strait had  frozen solid, creating a corridor between Alaska and Asia that enabled many  forms of life to cross continents...various reptiles--frogs, snakes,  including the pit viper--hopped or slithered over the bridge.&quot; Now  really, are we to believe that 8 editors and the author himself don't know  about cold blooded animals? What if this book were to fall into the hands  of some of our nation's third graders? Would they enter the fourth grade  thinking rattlesnakes slithered 12 miles across frozen ocean? Think, Alex,  think!<br />It's a pity the book is such a mess, since there's much of  interest in it. I'd always wondered where the expression &quot;missionary  position&quot; came from, and Shoumatoff provides a plausible explanation.  The saga of Clayton Lonetree was intriguing, as was the sidebar of the  crass Brit who came to make a documentary about Lonetree's release from  prison and the purification ceremony that followed. He was in it solely for  the money, and was soundly rejected by Lonetree's family.<br /> The whole  theme of  profiting from American Indians in one way or another is dealt  with several times from different angles. Shoumatoff mentions how one  tribal leader refuses to give out info on linguistics unless he is paid:  &quot;We don't give out that kind of information for nothing. We're wise to  you guys.&quot;; to which Shoumatoff responds that he's a &quot;great  believer in the free exchange of information&quot;, a response that is a  little puzzling in light of this book's $30 price tag. Perhaps it wouldn't  seem inappropriate to Shoumatoff for the man tocharge money for his  knowledge if he gave himself the title of linguistic consultant, and had an  office on the campus of a prestigious university.<br /> One stumbles into a no  man's land between capitalism and spirituality and scholarly research.  There is another chapter that deals with the ferocious competition among  archeologists to find the earliest human settlement in the Americas. If  that tribal rep were to have his way, all the old bones and potsherds being  dug up would have to be paid for, which doesn't strike me as so  unreasonable. On the other hand, some tribal reps would prohibit any  digging at all, and all remains currently in museums would have to be  returned to the ground. On still another hand, if the digging were to go on  with payments made to indigenous peoples, how would it be decided which  tribe would receive the money?<br />What would really be interesting would be  to pay the tribal rep for the info, then follow the money trail. Would he  split it equally with the other members of his tribe or keep it for  himself? Would he be taxed on the income if Shoumatoff were to deduct the  figure from his own income as a business expense? Can the US government tax  an Indian tribe? Would wholesaling relics and ruins be more profitable than  bingo? Could that possibly be a way of protecting the land from profiteers  who would destroy its beauty through the excessive mining and logging that  is detailed elsewhere in the book?<br />One wonders, finally, how this relic  of 19th century segregation called the reservation, which comprises a huge  percentage of the American Desert, has survived to the 21st.	2000-01-10
US	52767766	R17U2SRCJT2KGF	0761516077	69768655	The Builder's Secret: Learning the Art of Living Through the Craft of Building	Books	5	5	6	N	N	Useful tales from the cutting edge of shelter creation	Americans reached a point, not so long ago, where most did nothing in the way of creating shelter for themselves. Housing became just another product to buy or sell or rent. But there remained a few for whom the atavistic  urge to build was more attractive than a mere financial transaction. Now  that few has swelled into a tidal wave of owner-builders of every size and  shape who have poured such an ocean of cash into their projects that Home  Depot has supplanted Sears among the Dow industrial pillars.<br />It's curious  that with this massive shift and the thousands of how-to construction books  on the market, that a Builder's Secret type book has never been done  before--telling the stories of a few people who just went out and did it.  And it's also curious how a fairly mundane subject can make for such an  interesting book. How-did makes for better reading than how-to.<br />When I  began my first building project a few years ago I intended to keep a  journal of my progress. But of course there was not even time to get the  project done on time, much less chronicle the whole thing. Builder's Secret  is the closest thing I've seen to what I had in mind. It's not a journal,  but a set of tales based on interviews with a varied group of  owner-builders. Each is a vignette of material similar to that in Kidder's  &quot;House&quot;, with the important difference that all of these are  about people who do the work, rather than paying someone to do it. It's all  about work that is meaningful, that you can measure and admire at the end  of the day, and live in at the end of the project. Ehrenhaft doesn't  mention it, but I found myself thinking of the contrast between this sort  of work and the clock-punching type. Even those who build houses for a  living usually yearn to build for themselves, to do the work that has the  reward embodied in the thing created rather than in a paycheck. And how  many data base administrators dream of taking a few months off to structuretheir own database?<br />And it is the actual doing of the work that the  people of Builder's Secret seem to crave, for some of them are wealthy  enough to have hired it out; others, such as an architect in a major firm  would be more efficient sticking to their specialty and letting experts do  the hammering, but something drove them to do it themselves, something  probably not dissimilar to what drove all of Ehrenhaft's subjects: a couple  schoolteachers, a pro flutist, an ex cop, and a handful of hardworking  counterculture types. <br />I think the reason this disparate set of people  all embarked on building projects is akin to  the reason women bear  children the old way when Caesarian sections are more efficient, and why  people still slave over a hot stove making dinner when they could more  quickly and easily whip up a protein shake in a blender. It's fulfilling.  It's what we've done since the advent of Homo Sapiens, and possibly since  Homo Erectus, although erectus here would refer to back posture, not  plumbed up studs.<br />Who among us is fulfilled by the modern real estate  closing, a bloodless, soulless, insipid ceremony, where the high priests  and acolytes engage in a paper-shuffling without parallel, passing and  consecrating with signatures hundreds of boilerplate documents like so many  unleavened wafers of bread. The first thing you put in your new house is a  phonebook-sized wad of legal gibberish. How much more poignant the  tradition spoken of in Builder's Secret, the nailing of a sapling to the  peak of a new house. <br />If there is a defect in this book, it's the  exclusion of any discussion of financial motivations. Mr. Ehrenhaft states  on p.198 that &quot;no one made a financial killing&quot;, yet Jennifer  Lee, 155 pages earlier, tripled her investment in two and a half years. I  don't know about the backwoods of Massachusetts where Ms. Lee's from, but  80% a year is a killing in my neighborhood. Sure, it's a good feeling to  know the roof keeping the rain off your head was put up with your own two  hands, but it's also a pretty good feeling to sell your principal residence  and pay not a penny of capital gains tax. It's also nice to know, as you  swing the hammer, that Social Security and Medicare taxes are not taking  their royal fifth. Since this book is about the spiritual motivations and  rewards of builders, it's worth noting that few things in this world are as  dispiriting as socialism, and few as exhilarating as a great big payoff.	1999-11-30

I would guess that that's because of it's realism. The world of spies and spycatchers appears to be much drabber than what is portrayed in  the novels of Le Carre. I don't quite understand why I like that better,  but it's probably because I read such books to find out about the real  world rather than for escape into a fantasy world.<br />I found the amount of  politics and bureaucratic hurdles Herrington and his team had to go through  appalling, particularly the Justice Department insistence on a 100%  airtight case against a traitor of the magnitude of Clyde Conrad. On p.212  an attorney of the Justice Dept. says they will not authorize the arrest of  Conrad in spite of an overwhelming pile of evidence, and Herrington asks if  that is the attorney's personal view or the position of the attorney  general. The attorney answers ambiguously that it is the view of the  Justice Department. I find it very, very hard to believe that either Ed  Meese or William French Smith would hesitate to go after an enemy agent  like Conrad out of fear of failing to obtain a conviction. That sort of  timidity in defense of the departmental resume just wasn't characteristic  of the Reagan appointees. No, this sounds more like eunuchs guarding their  little piece of turf. Failing to arrest and prosecute Clyde Conrad on the  grounds that you might not get a conviction is tantamount to letting  Timothy McVeigh run free because he wasn't seen at the site of the Oklahoma  City bombing. I would only fault Colonel Herrington for not putting the  names of those cowardly Justice Department lawyers into this very fine book  for all to read.	1999-11-09

The author, a contractor in Manhattan, is expert at dealing with problems  most of us never have to deal with, such as the  mob-influenced/socialist-inspired New York City building code and cutthroat  clients poised to fleece him with the stroke of a pen. If you've got plenty  of money and you want to spend it prudently on a renovation of your home,  this is the book for you. If, on the other hand, you are strapped for cash  and struggling to add space for a growing family, or you are interested in  doing it yourself to learn things and save money, look elsewhere. This is a  book for the elite. To John Rusk, there is a right way and a wrong way to  do every project. If the right way is too expensive for you, then you  should forget about it until you have enough money. Now, if most of us were  to follow such advice, nothing would ever get done, except in the posh  neighborhoods. Still, it's interesting to read, if only to find out how the  other half (other tenth) renovates. The structure is composed of three  parts: Rusk lays out his theory and methods in one; the other two are  fictional narratives of a pair of young marrieds--one bright and the other  foolish. The foolish ones get into squabbles with everyone from the  architect to the carpenter; they are unfailingly pennywise. The bright  ones, after a few missteps, submit to the Rusk method, and are rewarded  with an excellent renovation. These fictitious episodes are naturally less  dry than the how-to sections, and make for highly enjoyable reading at  times. That technical contractual stuff may go over well at the Harvard B.  School, but let's face it, it's not the kind of thing you want to read when  you're gearing up for a big construction project. Most people I know would  rather take the contract out of contractor. &quot;Let's get on with  it!&quot; is their rallying cry. In just a few words, Rusk masterfully  sketches the character of the &quot;good&quot; contractor: Giovanni  DeTomaso, who sits, Brutus-like, sharpening his chisels and waiting for the  phone to ring. As a sometime contractor myself, I relished the scene of the  irate male of the bright couple being brought to heel.  Mr. DeTomaso  threatens to sever a support beam that was discovered inside a wall unless  Mr. Finley shows more respect. All too often, we contractors allow clients  to bully us just because it's their house. And the downward spiral of the  foolish couple was also gripping in a morbid sort of way, reminiscent of   the reversal-of-fortune plots of Dickens or Thackeray. As I read, I thought  of how the foolish element could give an edge to &quot;This Old House&quot;  when it gets dull. Imagine a Farrah Fawcett or Mary Tyler Moore character  fighting with Norm Abrams over the placement of a sink. In fact, this could  easily be expanded to a full-length feature where a couple of plutocrats  from Manhattan or Cambridge receives its comeuppance from an unwashed pushy  pair from Queens or Medford.	1999-10-06

Even as I write this, Builder's Square is conducting its going-out-of-business sale in the Denver area. They probably should have started it here about four years ago when Home Depot arrived, because they  really didn't have the ability to compete. By the time the Depot had five  stores built, places like Builder's Square and Home Base came to resemble  mausoleums more than home centers. The employees, when you could find them,  were usually ignorant about the products they sold. The products were often  in disarray on the shelf, with prices difficult or impossible to determine.  I once had a cart piled up with about $400 worth of merchandise at a Home  Base, but I had to walk out with nothing because the aisles were so piled  up with junk that I was unable to maneuver the cart to a cash register.   Built From Scratch tells the story well, without degenerating into an  informercial, as other books such as Nuts (about Southwest Air) have done.  And the authors tell of their prodigious achievement without letting it all  swell their heads in the manner of Ross Perot or Al Dunlop. One could hope  for more specificity in the matter of tactics. For example, how do they  always snatch up prime locations for their stores? How, out of all the  places in the world, did they arrive at India to be their supplier of slate  floor tiles? Or, do they ever ask European governments that want them to  set up operations how people can be expected to haul building materials to  their homes/projects, when the price of gas is over five dollars a gallon.    This book, and Home Depot itself, are rebuttals to all the sages who write  of the coming economy of keyboards and telephones, and the simultaneous  death of all manual employment. High tech is certainly the wave of the  present and future, but I've yet to see the software program that keeps  rain off your head, or that can perform the same function as a Pella  window. Speaking of software, why is there no mention in this book of whatdatabase management the Home Depot uses? I would also like the authors to  delve more deeply into the political issues on which, as a titan of  retailing, they have such clout. Low flush toilets, for example. With the  thousands (millions?) of toilets that are moving through their stores each  year, I think they have a duty to speak out on what is a danger to every  household that flushes: the 1992 law that requires all US manufacturers to  make toilets that use no more than 1.6 gallons of water per flush.  We know  now that this is madness. If my household has had five back-ups and  overflows in the first year of our 1.6 toilet (and we have), then we can  reasonably multiply that number by several million to get the total number  of back-up/overflows for the entire country. Multiply that number by  several trillion to get the amount of harmful bacteria that is spread by  these overflowing toilets, and you have the making of a health disaster.  Maybe the old standard of 3.5 gallons was too much, but it's obvious at  this point that 1.6 is not enough. And anyway, is it the proper role of the  government in a free society to tell us how much water we may use to wash  away our wastes?  Probably the Depot's greatest accomplishment is to have  done away with the old wholesale/retail dichotomy and its attendant  inefficiencies and waste. What a thrilling sequel it would be to write  about the development of one-click plywood purchases over the internet.  Could a merger of Home Depot and Amazon be in the offing?	1999-07-28
US	52767766	R12T9IXPQVR7LN	0393318885	27174518	The Wealth and Poverty of Nations: Why Some Are So Rich and Some So Poor	Books	4	1	3	N	N	Enjoyable and wide-ranging product of erudite fellow	So why are some nations rich and others poor? Does Landes tell why by the end of the book? Sort of. I would say he's right on the money until about 1900. He starts by examining the geography argument: Huntington and others  in the 19th century, who saw differences in prosperity from region to  region, and tried to fashion a &quot;science&quot; of economic analysis  based on climate. People in cold regions were energized and people in the  tropics were enervated. The former thrived and the latter loafed. Then  these theories shaded into ever more questionable connections between  climate and race and ability and wealth, and were ultimately discredited.  After all, if cold weather encourages prosperity, how are we to explain the  economic disaster that is Russia?  And why are Singapore, Hong Kong, and  Hawaii so wealthy in their tropical locations?  So if not geography, then  what? By way of answering that question, Landes discusses most major  movements toward riches and power that have ever taken place. Why does  Islam jump up and take over a large percentage of the world, then slip into  torpor and poverty? Why does the Industrial Revolution begin in England  instead of China, a civilization thousands of years older? Why does Spain,  winner of the global lottery in the 16th century, have nothing to show for  it by 1900? To sum it up in just a few words: freedom, tolerance,  curiosity, and common sense. The warriors of Islam could grab off an empire  and the scholars of Islam could lead the world in astronomy, but when  narrow-minded mullahs took over and banned all thought that was not in the  Koran, the advance stopped. The Chinese perfected the most basic human  activities: raising food and families. But ordinary Chinese were not  allowed to own property, and commercial activity down through the centuries  was, often as not, against the law. So while the Chinese people were  undoubtedly clever enough to set up factories and make piles of money, they  did not do so seriously until 1978 because their various governments  forbade it. Spain replayed the Islam story, with variations. Instead of  putting their riches and power into ever larger moneymaking ventures, they  squandered it in wars. Instead of cultivating their brightest citizens,  they placed the intellectual straightjacket of the Inquisition on them.  They kicked out the Jews. They kicked out the Moors. They attacked the  British. There is no better argument against climate and geography than the  Spanish. They controlled an empire that included tropics and temperate  zones, deserts and rain forests, minerals in fantastic abundance, swaths of  agricultural land into which you could drop several Britains. And after  three centuries what they had built was little more than a collection of  churches.   It seems to me that Landes is more adept at answering his  central question in the pre-industrial era, which is curious since he is an  Industrial Revolution scholar. Perhaps he knows so much about the IR that  it overloads the judgement capacitors in his brain. Or maybe a sudden heat  wave in Cambridge temporarily reduced his mental powers. Whatever it was,  after the first third of the book he seems to drift, ignoring the very  answers he's put his finger on: freedom, tolerance, curiosity, and common  sense. This seems to me to be of vital importance, because when you add to  these qualities an account of the natural resources of the various places  in the world, you can explain quite well (if a little glibly) why some  nations are so rich and some so poor. The Soviet Union, for instance, with  it's abundance of natural resources and able people could have been quite  prosperous, except that it was morally bankrupt from its inception. Science  was exalted, free thought and speech was forbidden, spirituality squelched,  and dissent not tolerated. In the various Islamic empires spirituality was  exalted, almost nothing was tolerated, and scientific advances were  searchedfor in the pages of the Koran. But more fascinating than these  broad explanations are the little side alleys of thought that abound.  Intellectuals have known for at least a dozen years that tolerance is a  good thing, but Landes shows in a number of situations just how costly and  economically atrophying intolerance is, in rich nations as well as in poor.  The American South never industrialized substantially until after the Civil  Rights movement. Paraguay, in the 19th century, attempted to make itself  into an egalitarian state but failed. Why? Because, like Castro, it  attempted to do so at gunpoint. The solons of Cambridge, among whom Landes  resides, could learn much from the story of little Paraguay. Every so often  Landes' writing becomes facile, as when he repeatedly dismisses one theory  or another with the phrase &quot;So much for...&quot; or when he lapses into  the Latin that academics still believe adds luster to their prose:  &quot;status quo ante&quot; instead of &quot;the way it was before&quot;.  Yet all in all, the defects are minor, and do not take away much from this  very impressive and enjoyable achievement: a world history that is not  constructed on the usual framework of treaties and political leaders, and  that is written in a lively and provocative style.	1999-07-11
US	52767766	R2NB8ESKYULIZ5	0071340955	156552863	Inside Home Depot	Books	3	29	34	N	N	Okay as a rough draft, but needs a lot more work.	This is a reasonably good book but sort of skirts around the Big Point in the Home Depot story. The Big Point is not that HD 'revolutionized an industry', but rather that it is one of the chief players in the creation  and growth of that industry. The do-it-yourself phenomenon is nothing new  in the world. Farmers and homeowners and small businesses have been  expanding their buildings and fixing their plumbing for centuries. What  Home Depot and its imitators have done is to institutionalize the servicing  of the do-it-yourself class and in so doing, enabled it to grow  exponentially. Do-it-yourselfing was not an industry 30 years ago. It was  just something ambitious or cash-strapped people did because they couldn't  afford to hire the companies who did that sort of work. It was hard because  they had to pay retail and they had to go to twenty different retailers to  get supplies. When Home Depot put everything under one roof and gave  everything the lowest possible price, the floodgates were opened and all  the pent-up demand fueled the Depot's stunning rise.<br />Chris Roush has all  the facts essentially right, but his writing is deficient. The subtitle  claims HD 'revolutionized an industry through the relentless pursuit of  growth'.  But then, what company does not relentlessly pursue growth? Does  the CEO of Sears tell his managers, 'Okay, people, we've had a pretty good  quarter so far, so we don't have to try to grow any more for awhile.' No.  Every company relentlessly pursues growth. That's what it means to be a  company in business to make money.   What separates HD from the  Sears-Roebucks of this world is the growth strategy in general, and pricing  strategy in particular. Sears puts on their products the highest price  possible short of making customers walk out of the store in outrage. Home  Depot sets its prices at the lowest possible point where they can still  make a profit. What separate HD from retailers like K-Mart is quality. You  can find low prices in a K-Mart, but all too often you find out a week or a  month later why the prices were cheap: the merchandise was cheap. Home  Depot sells top quality stuff as cheaply as they can while still making a  profit.<br />Roush goes on and on about HD's customer service, but really  doesn't come right out and say what is meant by customer service. Is it  having a clerk hovering over you every moment like in the department stores  of old? Is it having a fawning senior citizen foisting microwaveable  tidbits on you like in a Safeway or greeting you at the entrance to a  WalMart? No, Home Depot customer service is something useful. It's having  someone with a brain within shouting distance at all times, someone in  lumber who knows the difference between MDF and CDX, someone in tools who  knows a collet from a mandrel. You might have to get them off a forklift or  off their cell phone, but when you do, odds are they'll know what they are  talking about and where it is. Just the other day I asked a woman where to  find dielectric unions. She told me, without hesitation, 'Aisle 5, on the  left, halfway to the back'. And that's exactly where they were. I've had  that same experience many times in Home Depot. But that's not the way it  works in Builder's Square or Home Base.<br />To make this a better book in  future editions, Roush ought to get a firmer grasp of who his readership  is. Who the hell wants to read 'Management Lessons' at the end of every  chapter? Is this a textbook or a real book? Why not let Cliff Notes do a  simplistic summary in a separate volume? Is this a work of history or an  infomercial? If it's the former, then drop cheerleader chapter titles like  'Customer Service is Job No. 1'. Find an editor who can weed out all the  flabby writing. Someone, for instance, should have told Roush that he used  the meaningless filler phrase 'to be sure' over a dozen times. Someone  should have pointed out shoddy sentences like this one on page 192: 'In  Europe, Inglis received a green light in 1994 to enter Europe'.<br />Maybe  Roush, with his on-again/off-again journalistic objectivity, can't always  to distinguish right from wrong or good from bad. He doles out a lot of  treacle about Home Depot's owners helping  the victims of the Oklahoma  bombing, and trying to forge peace in the Middle East, and being good  corporate citizens in a variety of ways-- then writes the following  sentence about a government that publicly murdered thousands of its own  citizens in 1989 and keeps millions more in concentration camps to this  day: 'Having the Chinese government as a partner was also appealing'  (p.201).  I would guess that a capitalist like Marcus or Blank would find a  partner like the government of China about as appealing as  genital herpes,  and that's why there are no Home Depots in China. Of course, maybe that  will change. Lots of American companies did good business in Iran in the  Seventies and Germany in the Thirties.	1999-05-06

By implicitly condoning and even lauding a heretofore immoral trait, the authors of the Lazy Way series have begun the hard work of stripping  away the residue of the Protestant and Jewish work ethic in order to help  us achieve a worthier goal: total, unrestrained hedonism.<br />The target  audience of this book seems to be young homeowners who have day jobs and  are therefore unable to give a lot of time to the maintenance and  improvement of their abodes. It's a sort of cross between Heloise and Norm  Abrams with a little Painting For Dummies thrown in. I personally don't  like the Dummies/Complete Idiot approach, with its relentless attempts at  cuteness, but if it helps to bring software geeks and policy wonks to a  fuller understanding of gutters and studs, then so be it. Terry Meany isn't  so cloying as some of the dummy advisors, and with a little acid this book  could be made downright enjoyable.<br />The discussion of wood gutters could  be dropped altogether. Perhaps they're common in Seattle, but in my  experience they're as rare as California condors. If you do own a home  that's old enough to have wood gutters, it's likely you've got lath and  plaster walls, which render the studfinders Meany recommends totally  worthless, whether they're magnetic or electronic. Probably a third of the  homes in the country have plaster walls, which makes the alternative to  studfinders worth mentioning: measure over 16 inches from a corner or  doorway, then drive in and pull out a 2 inch nail every inch to the left  and right until you hit something solid. Fill up the little holes with  spackle, then touch up or hang a picture over them (which is probably why  you were looking for the stud in the first place).<br />I both applaud and  deplore Meany's section on yards. He recommends hiring somebody to cut your  lawn, which may not be 'A Complete Waste of Time', but is certainly a total  wasteof money, which, when you consider that most people exchange their  time for money, translates to A Complete Waste of Time. When you add to  that time spent watering, you approach if not embrace A Massive Waste of  Time. Yet, reading on, I found that Meany has actually hit upon the correct  solution, which is low and no-maintenance plants. Rip out the grass (that  is a task you'll want to hire out), till the soil, and plant tough,  aggressive groundcovers and shrubs. For groundcover, vinca can't be beat.  You can walk all over it, neglect it, never mow or trim it, and it still  looks great. It even has little purple flowers in the spring. For shrubs,  there is the usual assortment of evergreens, which grow to shapes varying  from elephant to doormat. And Meany forgot to mention herbs such as sage  and oregano. You can put in a little pint-size sage plant in the spring,  and by October it will be bigger than a lawnmower. The rule of total  neglect applies here, too. And it's great on chicken!<br />It was  disappointing to see Meany taking part in the government inspired hysteria  over lead paint. Lead, like asbestos, doesn't hurt you unless you eat it or  breathe the dust  in large quantities. The same can be said of concrete or  glass or fiberglass or even some types of wood. The lead paint rules in  standard housing contracts are simply boilerplate: legalese put there by  politicians reacting to a public horrified by child poisonings. If you're a  slumlord, you better cover up or 'abate' your lead paint. But if you're a  regular homeowner, you have nothing to worry about unless your paint is  peeling off in flakes and your children go unsupervised for long periods.  If that is the case, scrape it, apply some of the primer that is specially  formulated to stop peeling, and put on a topcoat of quality latex. Then go  pay some attention to your kids.<br />In the tool department I would make some  adjustments to Meany's list. For example, I would replace the hacksaw onthe Good-Idea Tools list with the reciprocating saw. If  you've ever tried  to hack through a pipe with a manual saw, you'll know what I mean. The  electric reciprocating saw, along with the microwave, is one of the  hallmarks of the late 20th century, things that save exponential amounts of  time. It's much less dangerous than a circular saw, and far more versatile,  mainly because of its shape. It's a cylinder with a blade on the end that  can be slipped into the smallest of spaces like a key, whereas a circular  saw is roughly the shape of a pumpkin. Trying to use a pumpkin like a key  is the  cause of many accidents, both to bodies and property. The  reciprocating saw can be used on everything from wallboard to fences to  pipes to branches. Don't forget to get the kind that doesn't require a  chucking tool to change blades.	1999-04-17

The trend toward authorial self-glorification has gone too far when the back cover of a book  reads: 'Daniel Yergin is an authority on world affairs'. What's next? An Expert on Matters Pertaining to the Universe?  <br />Considering his exalted position in the world, this is a remarkably  mediocre book, though there are details worth pondering, such as the irony  of Japan powering its Pearl Harbor raid with oil imported from California.  Worse than that, and more sobering, is the realization that Japan  subjugated Taiwan, China, and other parts of  Asia over the course of four  decades with oil from California. Millions of lives were destroyed, but the  oil spigot was not shut off until July of 1941. Why? Roosevelt did not want  to give Japan a pretext for attacking the East Indies. Yergin relates this  astounding spinelessness without a hint of irony, as though it were a  perfectly good excuse for supplying a fascist power with the means to mass  murder. <br />Yergin misses the boat entirely when it comes to the price drop  of the mid-eighties, claiming the Saudis flooded the market to gain market  share and that George Bush went from place to place as the 'point man' for  the Reagan administration arguing for a price floor for oil. Nonsense.  Ronald Reagan's goal was the destruction of the Soviet Empire, and one of  his key strategies was to take away the Russians' source of hard currency:  the sale of oil. Every one dollar drop in the price of crude deprived the  Soviets of billions of dollars of revenue, revenue that their own  paraplegic of an economy could never hope to generate on its own. If there  was any 'point man' for the administration in the Middle East, it was  William Casey, who guaranteed the Saudis' security against Marxist  revolutionaries and regional dictators like Saddam. In exchange,  the  Saudis flooded the market with oil. This not only deprived the Soviets of  real money, it also gave Americans the equivalent of a tax cut. Is it just  coincidence that the Soviet Union began to collapse just a few months  later? Just coincidence that the US saved the Saudis and Kuwait from the  fourth largest army in the world, when just a few years earlier these same  Arab sheikhs were universally reviled for having us over a barrel? <br />Also  lacking in this very thick book is any serious technical discussion of oil,  theories of exploration, pros and cons of new technologies...In place of  this, there is seemingly endless talk of contracts, and, even more  mind-numbing, negotiation of contracts, interlarded with impertinent  anecdotes about people who wandered in and out of the industry. Yergin  devotes a lot of space to rehashing trivia about Rockefeller and cliches  about Americans and their love of cars, material that has been presented  elsewhere so many times as to be almost common knowledge. In a book that is  ostensibly about oil and money and power, almost nothing is said about the  governments of Europe and their hyper-taxation of oil or what their goals  are and whether they've been attained. One looks in vain for any mention of  the natural gas or propane or diesel or asphalt or plastic industries.  <br />Overall, The Prize resembles a mass of articles from Newsweek and Time:  flaccid, insipid, superficial, slick. This would not surprise me if it were  the work of anyone other than 'an authority on world affairs'.	1999-03-21

It's very easy to slip into your carry-on luggage, and also easy to slip back into after you've been  interrupted by some pilot or flight attendant on the PA system. It's wry  without being morbid, open-minded without being flaccid.<br />As a journalist,  Tony Horwitz has a knack for pulling out revealing situations from a mass  of travel experience of the kind that most people would rather forget. He  has that rare gift for sketching in just a few lines a memorable scenario,  which often encapsulates one or another of  the persistent conflicts of our  time. For example, in a half dozen or so paragraphs on Palestine and  Israel, the reader sees why peace remains a 'process' instead of a reality.  In a visit to a Palestinian village on the Jordan River, his translator not  only translates from Arabic to English, but also transforms the innocuous  statements of a farmer into the tirades of a hate-filled fanatic. On the  other side of the Jordan, Israeli immigration makes note of Horwitz's  Jewish name and waves him through, while the elderly Palestinian couple  with whom he shared a taxi to cross the border must endure a strip search  and interrogation. <br />More fascinating still are Horwitz's sketches of  places seldom in the news: Yemen, where an entire country, even the  president, whiles away its time in a narcotic stupor induced by a chewable  shrub called qat; Sudan, where Arabs still make slave-gathering forays  after all these centuries and where leprosy is still a problem after all  these centuries; Iran, where a revolution, like so many other revolutions,  was great for awhile, but which now has become an oppressive burden.  <br />Perhaps this Iran piece is the most valuable of all the gems in Baghdad  Without a Map. It's like a tiny flashlight shone into a vast realm of  darkness. There is a fascinating passage on the covert socializing between  the sexes which must give some idea of what it was like to be young and in  love in the time of Torquemada. It might aptly be called  'The Mini Skirt  Beneath the Chador'.	1999-03-11

The span tables for  joists and trusses for live loads and dead loads and several different  species of wood strike me as overkill, when any carpenter or lumber  salesman or building inspector worthy of the name can tell you a safe span.  The same goes for plywood and other related sheathing. There's no need to  complicate matters with all the arcane ratings and designations put out by  the lumber associations. In a nutshell, plywood is either CDX (rough and  resistant to weather) or sanded (smooth and expensive) and comes in 1/4,  3/8, 1/2, 5/8, and 3/4 inch thicknesses.<br />The section on framing is quite  good, with clear illustrations and interesting discussion. The section on  plumbing is excellent, covering all aspects in just enough detail; the same  goes for the wiring, an area where all too many people fear to venture,  though most electrical problems are simple and safe to solve with minimal  precautions.<br />I do dispute Wing's chapter on insulation. He argues for  sealing up a house tight as a drum in order to keep every possible BTU  inside and hence save on energy bills. I don't think a highly sealed house  is a healthy environment, never mind about the many extra hours it would  add to a project to seal all the places he suggests. And I was a little  puzzled to read that the 'best-performing caulks are, unfortunately, not  commonly available'. The choice of caulks, in my experience, is huge, and  I've found most of them to perform very well. In fact, I am amazed sometime  at the variety and capability of the caulks on the market. I only wish such  abundance and competitive pricing existed in other markets such as that of  home videos and all-cotton boxer shorts. Puzzling, too, is his inclusion of  'sawdust' in a table of insulation materials. I have seen spaces between  studs filled up with sawdust to insulate, but that was on an old cabin in  the hills built in the twenties. Does anyone really still use sawdust for  insulation?<br />Finally, I don't think any guide to building materials is  complete without a discussion of where to buy things, for this is part and  parcel of the do-it-yourselfer experience. A person working with a  restricted budget (and who among us is not) will pay between 25% and 400%  more for most items at an independent lumberyard or hardware store than at  one of the big box retailers such as Home Depot or Builders Square. Thus,  it behooves that person to familiarize himself or herself with the standard  items in such stores and to design building projects accordingly.  Similarly, The Visual Handbook could be improved by further standardization  along these lines: excise all mention of  sawdust insulation,  quadruple-glazed windows, and Polynesian duo pitch trusses. These  improvements could well render the Visual Handbook indispensable and  suitable for use not only in construction zones but in high schools and  colleges as well.	1999-03-03

How refreshing it is to read a gem like LA Times, which contains not a single one of those ubiquitous literary pests: likeable characters. At first I thought Vinnie Callabrese was to be one, rising above an abusive  and impoverished background to become a successful studio executive and  moral exemplar. His efforts to get his first film made put my fears to  rest. Reading on, I realized that there were no good guys or gals in LA  Times, just a seething cesspool of villains. Now that I think of it, there  was one character who was not corrupt: the interior decorator. But he had  no part in the plot; he just decorated.<br />Woods either did his homework on  the Mafia and Hollywood, or he's involved in one or both of them. All the  dialogue rang true, and the situations were realistic and believable (with  the possible exceptions of Vinnie's rocket ride to the top of the heap and  the immediate Oscar). I particularly admire Vinnie's friend Tommy's  hamhanded approach to getting an option on a literary property.  The irony  was thick and deep, too, as when our hero takes a break from his frenzy of  promiscuity to make a donation to an AIDS charity. <br />I can see how women  might not like Woods' writing on sexuality. What are the odds that Vinnie  would meet three nymphomaniacs in a row? Then again, it must be kept in  mind that Woods specializes in the male version of the romance  novel.<br />What I liked best about LA Times was the deromanticizing of both  the Mafia and Hollywood. Woods builds up the Vinnie/Tommy relation as  though in a buddy picture: young up-and-comers bonded together by their  criminal past. Then it comes to light that Tommy 'made such a mess' of a  prostitute that Vinnie got for him in L.A., that the woman is in the  hospital and 'may never look the same again'. Really glamorous. Later, the  initially lovable Tommy reveals an even more brutal nature, directed at  Vinnie, and by this time our hero has shown him self to be fully deserving  of whathe receives at the hand of his buddy.<br />All in all, a truly  predatory story, sugar coated with money and status, if not likeability.  Every time I read the word 'gentlemen', as in 'Gentlemen, this meeting will  now come to order', I felt a guffaw rising in my throat. These people are  about as close to gentlefolk as a hog is to a butterfly.	1999-01-08

Did they all end up like Mussolini, hanging ignominiously from lampposts? Not exactly. If this thriller by Herbert Lieberman is any guide, they went underground and kept  on doing what they do best: bullying the weak, resenting the strong, and  indulging their passion for ghoulish ritual. <br />Their champion of the day  is a wealthy dilettante named Ludovico Borghini ('Ludo' to his friends,  'Maestro' to his toadies), who is determined to save Italy's rich cultural  heritage from foreigners, even if it means destroying it. Last in the line  of a powerful old Roman family, Borghini is almost immune to the law as he  kills and maims and carries out his program for the reinvigoration of  Italy. <br />Borghini's shadowy presence makes a formidable opponent to Mark  Manship, curator of the Metropolitan Museum in New York, who is out to  assemble the pieces of a comprehensive show of the work of Sandro  Botticelli. Since this entails taking any number of pictures out of Italy  to New York, Manship becomes Public Enemy Number One in the eyes of  Borghini. All Italians who come into contact with the American curator are  seriously imperiled, especially a beautiful young woman said to be a direct  descendant of one of Botticelli's models. Manship finds himself falling in  love with her even as he has unknowingly put her in harm's way. By the time  Borghini runs his tentacles out for her, Manship is back in New York  struggling against a more quotidian villain, the pompous windbag chairman  of the museum's board of directors. The woman, Isobel Cattaneo, is on her  own as she faces a truly horrific fate in the Villa Borghini at the hands  of its demented lord.<br />It's all very gripping and realistic, with the  possible exception of Harbor Rest, the place where Borghini stays when he  comes to New York, an '1840s farmhouse with wraparound porch...wedged in  between a sooty row of warehouse and derelict tenement buildings'. It's  been a long time since there were any farmhouses in the shadow of the World  Trade Center. But this is a minor detail. Overall, the settings and  characters are true to life.	1998-11-11

India, A Million Mutinies Now is like going to India with a friend who knows everybody, and takes you to meet everybody: holy men, politicians, authors, princes, revolutionaries, gangsters, women's magazine publishers...  At first, the prospect of so many interviews and anecdotes seemed daunting,  but as I read on I found that somehow Naipaul was able to drop one after a  few pages and go on to the next almost seamlessly, just as a skilled  conversationalist moves from one group to another at a party. It's a  testament to Naipaul's considerable ability as a  traveler and writer.<br />Although the interviews and mini-biographies are all about his subjects  and their lives, there is ever a sense of his presence, at once gentle and  piercing, the antithesis of the loud, gauche Western tourist. He is  critical without being crass, intellectual without being dreary. When he's  finished, a portrait of considerable depth and color has emerged.<br />I got  exactly what I wanted from it: a lot of perspective and innumerable  fascinating details. Like the U.S., India is a pluralistic nation limited  by its bigotry. Like Israel, it is sitting on a powder keg of ethnic  aspirations. Like China, it has way too many people.<br />How they cope (or do  not cope) with that last problem is a recurrent topic. A family of ten can  live together in a 10'X10' room by working and sleeping in shifts. A  talented young professional must turn down a good job because it requires  nine hours of daily commuting through Calcutta. People are loath to walk  outside because their clothing and skin gets begrimed with dust and soot in  a matter of minutes. Washing is difficult because the supply of water is  intermittent, as is the supply of electricity.<br />Naipaul presents basic  facts like these, which any journalist could provide, but then builds upon  this framework vignettes and tableaux that are often surprising or ironic  or astonishing. India has perhaps the largest collection of slums in the  world. Yet, for legal reasons, their film industry (also the largest in the  world) must build their own slum if they want to depict a slum in a film.  The most cursory reading of Indian history will tell you that the priestly  class of the Hindus (brahmins) must keep away from the latrine cleaning  class (sweepers). But did you know that a brahmin could be  &quot;polluted&quot; by a menstruating woman at a distance of up to fifteen  feet? Or that brahmins should only drink water that comes directly from the  earth (not from a pipe)? Or that some poorer brahmins, with the rising  wages of sweepers, have been reduced to cleaning their own latrines?<br />There is much affection and empathy in Naipaul's account, as in the  description of a family of five riding together on a motorcycle:  &quot;father on the main saddle, one child between his arms, another behind  him holding on to his waist, mother on the carrier at the back, sitting  sideways, with the baby.&quot; One sees in a glance the flirting with  catastrophe that is necessarily a part of most Indians' daily struggle.n the  world.

US	52767766	RW9EVSY5JU10V	0870813706	306087407	Colorado's Sangre De Cristo Mountains	Books	3	4	7	N	N	Great off-the-beaten path scholarship.	If there is a major error in Tom Wolf's deeply researched work on the Sangre de Cristo mountains, it must be the chronic overestimation of human potential. He makes a case for a new sort of &quot;management&quot; of the  mountain range, one that places control among locals. However, having  evolved over millions of years without human assistance into marvelous  things, mountain don't need management.<br />Perhaps what Wolf intends is to  better manage the people who come to the mountains. That is a worthy goal,  as long as the people to be managed are wielding destructive devices such  as cars or chain saws. But if he means, as I think he does, that everybody  who wants to take a walk in the mountains should pay five or ten dollars in  &quot;user fees&quot;, then I oppose him enthusiastically.<br />Such a course  seems to me to be needlessly commercial, taxing and selling activities  which are as basic and essential as breathing. He has doubts about  wilderness status for the Sangres, because of the lack of revenue from  so-designated land. But what is this foregone revenue to have been put  toward? Management, in a word. He wants to take the levers of control out  of the hands of what he calls the Iron Triangle (politicians, special  interests, bureaucrats), and place them into the hands of a trust composed  of local ranchers, community activists, forest rangers, shampoo tycoons,  biologists, economists...some sort of Iron Polyhedron. This body would act  sensibly when a crisis such as insect or disease epidemic arose. One can  assume there would be controlled burns, controlled wood cutting (going  under the euphemism &quot;harvest&quot;), controlled hunting (going under  the euphemism &quot;harvest&quot;), and controlled entry into the  controlled wilderness area.<br />Now, I have nothing against hunting or  lumbering or even wildfires. All are necessary or desirable in their time.  But the notion of the sand dunes being ruined because of increased hikers,  or of valleys being inundated in a sea of elk droppings, or of forests  being denuded by out-of-control herds of deer are far fetched. Similarly,  Wolf's assertion that at the end of the last Ice Age, primitive hunters,  without the use of guns or horses or sport utility vehicles, indeed without  anything but &quot;new flint technology&quot;, were able to drive into  extinction 32 genera of post-Ice Age mammals strains credibility. Just as  we should cast a jaundiced eye on any of society's plans to  &quot;save&quot; nature, we also should guard against giving mankind too  much of the blame for the ebb and flow of natural cycles.<br />Wilderness  status for the highest reaches of the range simply protects it from the  exploitation of the sort Wolf detail. If one can take any lesson from his  account of the various follies visited on the range, it is that no plan can  benefit the mountains as much as leaving them alone. And yes, I consider  hordes of recreational users who are not shooting anything or cutting  anything to be leaving the mountains alone. Crowds of people, if they ever  do materialize in the roadless areas, will be as benign a presence as a  herd of buffalo. And I'll gladly take 20 random flyovers by jet fighters in  place of every No Trespassing sign put up by the so-called &quot;Ranch for  Wildlife&quot; crowd. The former are thrilling and harmless, the latter  oppressive.<br />One must take the hat off to Wolf for his monumental effort,  however. Who would have thought so much could be written about a backwater,  and that it could be linked in so many ways to the mainstream? A greater  effort should have been made in the way of editing so as to correct  mistakes such as on p.80, where he states &quot;The Sangres stretch from  the 42nd to the 41st parallel.&quot; These coordinates would put them in  Wyoming, giving the lie to the title's claim that they are Colorado's.  Also, on p.265 Steve McNichols is mistakenly named as the governor of  Colorado in 1975. Dick Lamm was governor at that time. But these are  trifling errors...1975. Dick Lamm was governor at that time. But these are  trifling errors...	1998-10-29

How ironic that the most extravagant emperor in history should be a Marxist. Next to the Mao depicted in this book, Czar Nicholas seems a naïve schoolboy, Nero a mere dandy. As tens of millions of his own people starve  to death because of his deluded policies, Mao lounges about in bed for days  on end reading history and eating fatty pork. As tens of millions of  families are torn apart by the persecutions he promotes in his Cultural  Revolution, he blithely carries on sex fests night after night like some  superannuated rock star.<br />Dr. Li, doing involuntary service as Mao's  personal physician, had a ringside seat for this spectacle from 1955 to  1976. Mao didn't need a round-the-clock doctor. He just wanted Dr. Li  perpetually on call in order to gratify his need for control. Li himself  wanted to be a real doctor, to help sick people. But had he acted on his  desire to resign his post and go to work in a hospital, he might well have  found himself and his wife and children thrown into Maoist concentration  camps (euphemistically called reform-through-labor camps) like millions of  his compatriots.<br />So Dr. Li bit his tongue and submitted to his bondage.  He also, unbeknownst to Mao, took copious notes.<br />Li brings Mao up close  and in person as he swims with relish in rivers floating with human  excrement, as he hatches plans to make fields that had produced two tons of  grain for 4000 years produce eight tons simply by digging deeper and adding  more seed, as he crows over the success of backyard steel furnaces in  melting down doorknobs into amorphous ingots. The account sometimes  resembles a description of someone undergoing a series of hallucinations,  and the hallucinations becoming public policy. <br />Mao, who is often given  credit for industrializing China, did not have the sense to provide his  workers with something so basic as a wheelbarrow. In the sole recorded  instance of this champion of the laborer doing any labor, Li shows him  joining workers who are equipped with baskets and shoulder poles for the  building of a dam. Predictably, Mao gives his shovel to someone else after  a few minutes, and retires to a tent to drink tea. <br />His thoughts on  public health are equally advanced. Upon being told by his doctor that, as  a carrier of a sexually transmitted disease, he is infecting hundreds of  women and that it would be helpful if he would wash himself from time to  time and perhaps go so far as to take some medicine, the great man replies  that, since he has no symptoms, he sees no need to take any medicine. As  for washing himself, Mao explains, &quot;I wash myself inside the bodies of  my women.&quot;<br />Thus, it makes no difference whether you're a health  professional or a connoisseur of depravity, a peasant or a president.  There's something for everyone in The Private Life Of Chairman Mao.	1998-10-27

Our political leaders  are beset by satyriasis and mendacity. Our sports icons gobble steroids,  routinely violate the terms of their parole, and sometimes even behead  their wives.<br />That makes it surprising to encounter a genuine hero, which  the author of The Courage To Stand Alone certainly is. It is doubly strange  that he should emerge from China, the land of groupthink and  hyperconformity. Who would have thought that a child of the Cultural  Revolution would become a major force for decency and dignity even as those  qualities were being rendered quaint and passe by the rush for market share  in the New Global Economy?<br />When Wei Jingsheng was first put into prison  and began writing the letters that make up the bulk of To Stand Alone,  Mandela had been in prison for 17 years, Solzhenitsyn had just published  Gulag in English, and the concept of dissent was unknown in China. When Wei  was released in 1997 and flew to the US after having served 18 years in  China's gulag (known there as laogai), Mandela was president of South  Africa, Solzhenitsyn had returned to a free Russia, and Deng had  transformed China from a socialist police state to a plutocratic police  state. With all the stuff in our hardware stores and clothing shops bearing  the Made in China tag, you might even think China had been transformed into  a free society. You would be mistaken to think that, however. Wei was  imprisoned for exercising one of the simplest and most basic rights, that  of free speech. He published a magazine. In it, he urged the Chinese  Communist Party to honor all the grand promises it made in the  constitutions it churned out from time to time, promises like &quot;The  People have the right to speak out freely, air views fully, hold great  debates, and write dazibao (large character posters posted on walls in  public places for all to read)&quot;. <br />Wei had begun his career as a  dissident by putting up onesuch dazibao: his essay &quot;Democracy: The  Fifth Modernization&quot;. This document (included in To Stand Alone) is a  piece of impassioned logic which a Jefferson or Hancock would be proud to  sign. He wrote it and posted it the same night on Beijing's Democracy Wall.  Unlike the others who posted writings there, Wei left his name and number.  That wasn't safe, but Wei believed the Chinese were getting a worldwide  reputation for spinelessness, thanks to people like Deng and Lin Biao who,  during the reign of Mao Zedong, had taken the craft of brown-nosing and  sycophancy to new depths. <br />In 1979 Deng was just beginning his reign, and  many thought he was a new kind of leader, which he was, in some ways. In  other ways he was the oldest kind of leader there is: a tyrant. In his  magazine, Wei identified him as dictator-in-the-making a full 10 years  before Deng ordered the murder of  hundreds of students in Tiananmen  Square. That prediction put Wei in prison, the special Chinese kind of  prison where you are expected to confess your &quot;errors&quot; and  &quot;crimes&quot;.<br />There was a certain amount of international pressure  on China, so Wei probably could have gotten out early for confessing his  &quot;crimes&quot;. But he had that thing about backbone, about standing  upright for what you believe in. He was, it must be noted, a little  stubborn. Actually, more than a little stubborn. Actually, you know nothing  about stubborn until you read this book. Picture David Niven going into the  oven in Bridge On The River Kwai for insisting on being treated like an  officer according to the Geneva Convention. Now picture him doing that  every day for 18 years, and you have some idea of what Wei went through.  Not an oven, but a box without windows, very little food, very little heat  in a region bordering Tibet,  no medical care, sleep made impossible,  beatings, solitary confinement for months on end...All these measures  notwithstanding, Wei would notconfess to a crime he had not committed. He   wouldn't even get impolite. In his letters from prison, he demands the  basic rights he's been stripped of in a tone less harsh than I use on my  neighbor's barking dog. Reading these letters one occasionally gets the  feeling he's been detained through some silly bureaucratic mix-up. Of  course, he wasn't. He was thrown into the largest system of concentration  camps that yet exists on the planet, just like millions of his compatriots.  He's out now, but the others are still there, doing slave labor, starving,  being executed by the score,  involuntarily donating their organs to  international markets...<br />When the Chinese Communist Party falls, as all  brutal, sadistic regimes inevitably do, this book of letters and one  landmark essay will be remembered as one of the chief causes of its  demise.<br />Wei, if you read this, I would urge you to post Democracy: The  Fifth Modernization on this site. It's common for authors to put excerpts  of their books here, and that essay would be a perfect sample. I doubt the  Party will be able to have it removed.	1998-10-18

Once in awhile a book comes along that has that special quality of  illuminating a real world mystery. Robert Caro's biography of Johnson and  Albert Speer's  memoir are two such works. Peter Schweizer's Victory is  another.<br />For years I wondered, as I read news accounts and histories, why  no one had a logical explanation for why oil prices had dropped so  dramatically in 1985, when just a couple years earlier pundits were saying  the sky was the limit for oil. And why, shortly thereafter, did the Eastern  Bloc begin to crumble, soon to be followed by the Soviet Union itself? Then  why did the Bush Administration see fit to conduct a war to liberate Kuwait  and protect Saudi Arabia? And were all these momentous events related? The  answer is yes.  Victory describes clearly how they all were indeed closely  related. <br />King Fahd of Saudi Arabia was worried that he would be  overthrown as the Shah of Iran had been, either by Muslim extremists, or by  Soviet backed revolutionaries. At the same time, the Reagan Administration  was interested in the economic strangulation of the Soviet Union. The  source of most of the USSR's hard currency was the sale of its oil on  international markets. So a deal was struck.. The US would guarantee the  security of the Saudi monarchy with AWACS jets and Stinger missiles and,  ultimately, US armed forces. In return, Saudi Arabia would flood the market  with oil, driving the price for a barrel of crude from $35 down to  $10.<br />With its oil income cut by 70%, Moscow could no longer buy the  technology it needed to keep pace in the arms race, let alone dole out  largesse to Poland or East Germany. And when Iraq invaded Saudi Arabia's  tiny neighbor Kuwait, it was time for the US to uphold its part of the  bargain. <br />Victory aptly describes this and other maneuverings to win the  Cold War, such as the support of the mujahedin in Afghanistan and of the  Solidarity movement in Poland. It is based largely on interviews with such  key players as Caspar Weinberger, Robert MacFarlane, George Schultz,  Richard Pipes, Herb Meyer, and Richard Allen, so that it provides an almost  palpable sense of being in the White House as the strategy was crafted. It  effectively gives the lie to those facile commentators in the media who  claim the Soviet Union fell of its own weight. It didn't. It was pushed.	1998-10-09

Twelve corpses of people who worked in a federal research facility stacked  up &quot;like Lincoln Logs&quot;, discovered by a volunteer fire dept.  crew, and nothing leaks out to the news media. No investigation is ever  made. Why? Because the &quot;good stuff never makes it into the  paper&quot;,  according to one nudist colony member now living at the scene  of the crime. &quot;The truly interesting news, somehow they manage to keep  it quiet.&quot; We're expected to believe this? That purges going on in  Florida are kept quiet? And who is the &quot;they&quot; that keeps it  quiet? That question is never really answered, other than some oblique  references to the CIA.<br />Thorn, the laconic he-man hero of Mean High Tide  readily swallows this line without a trace of doubt. So too, apparently,  did the families and friends of the slaughtered researchers. Yet, in  another part of Florida, a &quot;thorough investigation&quot; is made to  find the person who carved an obscenity into the skin of a potato.<br />Now,  I'm not a person who insists on absolute realism in fiction, but, golly,  this seems a bit much. Twelve people? A potato skin?<br />Later, an ex-Mafia  hood comes into Thorn's house in a quiet residential neighborhood and  honeycombs it with shots from a gun that makes fist size holes in the  hardwood floor. In my limited experience, a gun that powerful makes quite a  loud noise. Yet no one calls the police. Thorn has to be talked into doing  this himself by his friend, Sugar, an ex-cop. It's a gross inconvenience to  Thorn, who, in his words, is &quot;not up to dealing with police bullshit  at the moment&quot;. A man of action, he is not often up to dealing with  such niceties, for he is usually busy avenging the brutal killings of  virtually all his loved ones: his mother, his brother, his lover, his  friends, the environment...<br />All Thorn's rage, however, cannot drive out one  nagging problem of plot. The man wielding the big gun  in Thorn's house had  no motive in the story for being there. In fact, he has no direct contact  with Thorn for the rest of the book.<br />Simply put, huge parts of Mean High  Tide make no sense. The assassin with no motive nor connection, the  uninvestigated pile of twelve bodies, the other uninvestigated pile of  bodies discovered by Thorn later, the curious fact that animals, from  squirrels to alligators, copulate whenever observed by Thorn...<br />While the  plot is a mess, the characterizations at least are acceptable, especially  those of the villains. The most amusing is Sylvie, a demented girl of  25  who lures men to try to kill her father, an ex-CIA assassin. He, too, is a  splendidly evil fellow, hatching a scheme to destroy the planet's  biodiversity. His cruel cunning and ruthlessness provides a welcome respite  from the tediously macho and stolid Thorn and his equally tedious, though  less macho, sidekick Sugar.<br />But then even Harden Winchester (the ex-CIA  hit man) falls prey to expository monologue disease in a scene at a bar  with Thorn that is so dazzlingly out of character for the brutal killer  that I was sure the referee would step in and stop it. But no. It plodded  doggedly on for several pages until we realized why the hit man was so  naughty.<br />There is a climax toward the end in which Thorn administers  mouth to mouth resuscitation to Sugar (is there a gay subtext here?), while  a few feet away occurs simultaneously what may be termed The Clash of the  Geriatric Titans. (Where else but in Florida?) After these and other  conflicts are resolved, there remains only the environment to save. To  accomplish this, the fish are assaulted by hand grenades (yes, the fish)  thrown by the redoubtable Thorn. If you want to know why, you'll have to  read Mean High Tide.	1998-09-25

Think this way of the Son of God: a peevish, fastidious, obsessive fanatic  who throws a magic trick whenever his disciples' interest begins to flag or  someone disagrees with him too strongly-a bully. Instead of obsessions with  faith and the father in heaven, Millroy concentrates on food and how it  comes out after digestion, but the allusions to Jesus are unmistakable.  Millroy laments the money-grubbers in TV-land, just as Jesus threw the  money-changers out of the temple. Millroy demands absolute fealty, just as  the Nazarene did. Children must give up all they have to follow him,  including their families and normal eating habits. They are all poor,  uneducated kids from broken and/or abusive families, so they are glad to  join his cult and follow his rules. When a child strays from the course by,  say, eating a hamburger on the sly, he or she is either ostracized or  forced to submit to an on-the-spot stomach pumping. Millroy, like Jesus,  promises everlasting life-well, almost. 200 years is close enough.  <br />Millroy also has Jesus'  persecution complex, with marketing execs and  tabloid reporters and rival televangelists filling in as Pharisees. He is  hounded first out of the TV business, then the restaurant business. Through  these ventures, Theroux manages to parody both the health food nuts and  religious zealots that Millroy embodies, and also the regular American  slobs that Millroy pities and rejects. In my opinion, it's a welcome  mock-up. Can we deny that America has become the &quot;Land of the  Fat&quot;? On the other hand, is Millroy's literal Biblical cuisine any  more practical than our non-fiction Bible thumpers' insistence on literal  Biblical truth in such matters as geology and obstetrics?<br />It is enjoyable  to follow the steps of this latter day passion play, because poking fun at  ThatStory has always been taboo. Then when we reach the veiled parody of  the transubstantiation, the joke is very rich indeed. Millroy delivers the  gag in the sententious tones of the Redeemer, exhorting his disciples to  eat his sliced up finger because &quot;This is not meat. It is  Millroy.&quot; Okay, as long as you're sure it's not meat. I've been at  Seders where they say something like that: &quot;This is not tref. It is  gefilte fish.&quot;<br />This is what I've always relished about Theroux, the  puncturing of puffed up things like the Hemmingway legend and the legend of  the Happy Isles of Oceania. When he writes travel books, you can tell he's  not on someone's payroll, because everything is not always wonderful.  Instead of a swell little restaurant, you read about not-so-nice natives.  When he writes fiction, you get the sense that he's not on anyone's  ideological payroll, and that is refreshing in these politically correct  times.<br />Millroy turns human at the end. He keeps throwing his weight  around like a Messiah in order to impress his girlfriend, Jilly Farina: he  calms the storm on the Sea of Galilee (only it's in a Boeing over the  Pacific); he raises Lazarus from the dead...but flashy tricks are not what  she wants. Healthy food, magic tricks, everlasting life (almost)...those are  all very nice, but she wants something superior to a savior. She wants a  lover.	1998-09-12
