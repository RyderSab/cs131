This should be a welcome work, the battlefield is the most complete one of its kind ever found, located in a semi-rural area of Germany and undisturbed for two thousand years. Unfortunately rather than stating the discoveries and giving a view to all possible theories, which would have made this a seminal work, Wells misses this opportunity by embarking on an opinionated interpretation of the event. Judicious and balanced this work is not. Perhaps this is possibly explained by his area of concentration in anthropology; his writings are almost exclusively dedicated to the northern barbarians of antiquity. In spite of their victory, Wells seems somewhat defensive of the German tribes in his portrayal of the battle.<br /><br />Much of the book is quite interesting; Wells does a nice job of describing the lifestyle of the Romans on the Rhine in their garrisons as is the chapter on the anthropology of the German tribes and the background of Arminius, the German leader who lured Varus into the ambush by pretending friendship. While Wells states that Germans engaged in a militarization because of the Roman intrusions, the truth is that they were not peaceful natives conducting tea party's. They were notorious raiders who often preyed on each other and known to both the Gauls and Caesar two generations earlier, as a serious military threat. There is a chapter that describing battle from an individual's perspective and a section that discusses battlefield wounds; both are stimulating and intelligently drawn. It's a tragedy that the most informative and important chapter in the book on the archeology of the battlefield is extremely brief although the eight pages of pictures are helpful and instructive.<br /><br />Someday someone will adopt a rule for scholars of military history that academics will be prohibited to write about tactical matters without first spending some time as infantrymen. I make the comment only half-jokingly for throughout the \\"Battle that Stopped Rome\\" Professor Wells makes assumptions that a 25 year-old infantry squad leader today could correct. While weapons have changed, much of tactical ground movement on foot remains very similar in many ways. Take Wells ambush scenario. He criticizes the Roman view that Varus was to blame for the slaughter, because in his view, this downplays the competency of the Germans. Wells assumes that auxiliary scouts (German) told the Romans the way was clear, yet later on acknowledges auxiliary cavalrymen's spurs interred with Roman bodies indicating they perished along with them (Roman legions under Germanicus buried many of the remains when discovered years later).<br /><br />Any movement of a unit through a narrow passage in unfriendly or unknown territory is dangerous and for a commander, then or now, not to take precautions is simply irresponsible. Soldiers understand this concept today and the Romans- competent professionals- understood it. Wells seems to misunderstand that this doesn't downplay the competence of German tribes, it acknowledges their ability to conduct serious operations. There was ample evidence of this German tactic as even he states that Drusus and his legions almost succumbed to a similar disaster in 11 B.C. Certainly Varus assumes much responsibility for the disaster.<br /><br />There are also little quibbles. Unsure, the author speculates on an amazing find, a legion donkey's bell stuffed with grass. Perhaps, he asks, it was to squelch it's sound or was it to allow the soldiers to hear what was happening around them? Some things don't change, ask any infantryman about that bell and he'll understand it immediately. Wells speculates that the Romans fled in panic within minutes, yet there is evidence along the walls in the form of legionary effects, that some attempted a counter-attack on the ambushers (a technique taught today to soldiers caught in ambushes). The garrison at Haltern is singled out because of the large quantity of items buried by the unit stationed at the location, which Wells helpfully points out \\"fled in terror\\". Again he seems misses what seems obvious; buried items indicate time to plan. Terror-filled troops don't organize the burial of equipment, money and other personal items, they leave immediately. The alternate answer is the unit knew of the disaster or was called back and in either case intended on returning.<br /><br />But what may be regarded as the worst criticism is saved for his description of the battle and his unwarranted speculation that it was over in an hour; the legions were annihilated or captured by that time. This is squarely in opposition to Cassisus Dio's written description over a century later that a large part of Romans escaped initial destruction and built defensive works nearby succumbing to the Germans within three days. But Wells gives no reasons for his this major departure and states only in a footnote his agreement with scholars who doubt Dio. While ancient writers must often be taken with a grain of salt, one does so in such a dramatic fashion with peril. Velleius Paterculus, a contemporary of Varus and probably acquainted with him, writing only a few years after the battle says the two prefects survived long enough to speculate on surrender of the remaining forces or death in combat and one Lucius Caedicius may have made it back to a Roman camp with a band of survivors. Tacitus as well, relying on reports from survivors and veteran's of a later campaign, writes that the legions under Germanicus finding the site saw ramparts where it looked clearly like defensive works were built, indicating much more than an hour-long battle (to be fair Tacitus may have mistaken the partially fallen German wall used to cover their ambush for the army's defensive positions). Wells ignores this completely. He ignores that human remains found buried together were almost certainly the result of burial by the legions of Germanicus lending some credibility to Tacitus' version of events. He also ignores physical evidence that shows movement in two columns west of the narrow passage in what seems a fighting retreat, possibly supporting Dio and Paterculus' statements on the battle.<br /><br />One of the chief archeologists of the site, Suzanne Wilbers-Rost, has said that her own opinion is the number of killed at the immediate battle site was closer to 10,000 than 20,000. That may mean either some troops did not accompany Varus or that a large number survived the initial onslaught and moved off the battlefield, further indicating that the battle took much longer than the one hour Wells speculates. That he chose to write and dictate a chapter based on such a position seems a serious error on his part.<br /><br />While there is a lot to applaud in \\"The Battle That Stopped Rome\\" it ultimately seems a vehicle for a misplaced defense of the German tribes who won and poorly thought out assumptions on the tactical nature of the battle in spite of the dramatic and excellent description of individual combat. Wells spends a lot of ink explaining that the Romans held the Germans in contempt and were loath to think that they could execute an attack with any degree of coordination. He seems to dismiss Drusus' earlier difficult venture into Germany, Tiberius' invasion demanding more than ten legions which (cut short by probems in Illyria) or Varus' assembling of three legions along with cavalry and auxiliaries to counter a perceived threat to believe instead that Rome dismissed German military ability. Being condescending and arrogant of your opponent if you are an ancient Roman writer is one thing, but the legions knew better. While the Germans won due to the duplicity of Arminius, something Wells seems curiously critical of the Romans for pointing out,in the end Varus is as much to blame for his failure to heed warnings given by other Germans and his complete tactical failure in a dangerous crossing. Six years later the Romans returned to Germany under Germanicus exacting retribution of sorts and Arminius' met his end being murdered by his own people. While the battle was a psychological blow to Rome, previous forays into the region had already showed the legions that the conquest of Germany would take a large amount of military resources.<br /><br />The final answer to the Roman approach to Germany may be that it was simply not worth the serious efforts it would have taken to conquer it. While \\"The Battle That Stopped Rome\\" is an interesting and worthwhile read, it contains far too much speculation than should have been included. A comprehensive story of the battle based on the archeological evidence and ancient sources is still to be written.ores that human remains found buried together were almost certainly the result of burial by the legions of Germanicus lending some credibility to Tacitus' version of events.

Tom Holland is fine writer, and a decent enough biographer but I'm a bit appalled by two things in \\"Rubicon\\"; the weakness of his historical analysis and the buying of this \\"brandy snifter\\" version by many readers but more importantly many newspaper and magazine book reviewers. This criticism should be taken seriously because the fall of the republic has been pointed to as having analogies to our present day situation in the U.S. Reading these reviews in some widely read publications (as well as seeing the author interviewed on TV) it seems that no one noticed Holland has done a terrible disservice and should be taken to task over it.<br /><br />Holland has written an engaging account of the fall of the Roman Republic, but it is an account rooted in an 18th century gentleman's version of Rome. In Holland's Rubicon historical analysis has moved forward barely an inch since Gibbon. Of course facts have been modernized based on updated discoveries, but not the analysis. Biographical information has been fleshed out to make it a bit more tabloid. The mob is still the mob; no matter that it encompassed over 90% of the population of Rome, that it had both its political and economic rights limited by the Roman Senate which was made up of perhaps 100 or so families. The guilds set up to provide protection to the families and artisans are described as nothing but \\"gangs\\" by the ancient historians, repeated by the 18th century ones and further propagated by Holland who should know better. Like those historians, in Holland's republic only the named and the aristocracy have any honor, well, to his credit not many of them have that either. No matter that the Senate was made up largely of the rich and powerful who used the Roman constitution was for keeping power from the plebian majority, steering economic benefits to the optimates and disenfranchising members of \\"the mob\\" both economically and politically.<br /><br />I can just see the intellectual equivalents of the mullet-wearing-camaro-driver extolling the \\"virtues\\" of Cato. Perhaps the most ignorant man in the Republic, Cato's stubborn refusal for political compromise was as responsible as anything else for the descent into Civil War and the end of the Republic. To call him conservative is an insult to conservatives. He was a reactionary backward thinker who rejected the land due veteran's of Rome's wars, who fought against any enfranchisement of non-senatorial families, he was the Mr. Nyet [Andre Gromyko] with-an-attitude of his era. But, he was honest of course, and somehow that makes this Church-Lady of the Republic worthy of idolization.<br /><br />Julius Caesar, that ambitious larger than life figure, is cut down by Holland. Not for Holland Caesar's magnanimity, he seems to cynically imply it was all a PR stunt. Not for Holland that Caesar, the populist, was by most accounts of moderate political temperament in spite of his ego.  Caesar is the leader of the majority of citizens (or \\"the mob\\"), in Holland's Rome there's no greater indicator of unworthiness. Caesar didn't destroy the Republic for that blame Sulla, Cato and countless other \\"worthy\\" supporters of the Republic whose intransigence and refusal to commit to reforms and organize a more rational power-sharing system built a well of animosity that would someday result in the Empire. With all his faults, Caesar was a reformer who aimed a making the system workable and more importantly somewhat more equitable.<br /><br />Should you read Rubicon? Of course, Holland is a good writer and the work is entertaining, but readers should be aware of his brandy snifter/smoking jacket view of Rome and adjust their sights accordingly.t-wearing-camaro-driver extolling the \\"virtues\\" of Cato.

US	50237851	R2F5KQBGKPVDRB	1565849426	231333150	The Assassination Of Julius Caesar: A People's History Of Ancient Rome (New Press People's History)	Books	5	18	23	N	N	Controversial retelling of the fall of the Roman Republic	Nominated for the 2003 Pulitzer Prize, there is a lot to dissuade the serious reader of Roman history in Michael Parenti's \\"The Assassination of Julius Caesar\\". A radical commentator on contemporary society and historical memory, Parenti applies a \\"Marxian-lite\\" analysis of the late Republic. In hearing a talk he once gave, one comment he made stands out; \\"One of the great pleasures of learning history is not the learning it but the unlearning of preconceived notions\\". To that end he has an axe to grind with historians of the era and, in the first chapter, he names names and takes few prisoners. The effect of all this is to put the reader off a bit.  I was taken aback as Parenti railed against the \\"gentlemen historians\\" and the class based prism that they have used to interpret the assassination of Caesar.<br /><br />The question Parenti sets out to answer is not who killed Caesar, that is well established, but why. His answer is that the conspirators were representative of the most reactionary elements of a conservative Senate and the wealthy class interests they defended. To Parenti the domestic policies of the late republic were the politics of class warfare. Landed interests expropriated land from citizen-soldiers away on war, voted themselves subsidies and lowered their own tax burden. Lower class citizens were denied a majority of the wealth flowing into the Republic (the result of new conquests) and deprived of their small farms with little but the tribunes to protect their interests.<br /><br />Attempts by reformers such as the Gracchi were seen as a usurping of the republic's institutions, most importantly the Senate. To Parenti the senatorial exhortations to uphold the \\"rule of law\\" were natural; the Senate passed the laws, the laws benefited their class. The elimination of the threat of reformers became a quest for many of the ruling class and these self-styled \\"optimates\\" resorted to inciting the populace and \\"death squads\\" to eliminate those seen as radicals.<br /><br />The book reserves a special chapter for Cicero, and it isn't pretty. An excerpt reveals the extent of Parenti's view of the Roman Senator; \\"A self-enriching slaveholder, slumlord and senator Cicero deplored even the palest move towards democracy\\". A hypocrite when it was warranted, Cicero was a staunch opponent of the Roman \\"masses\\" and of Caesar. The author paints Cicero as rejecting reforms such as the moderate package put forth by Caesar as consul, engaging in a never-ending quest to promote and protect the privileges of the ruling class. Parenti even casts doubt on the validity of the Catilinarian conspiracy, questioning the sparse evidence given as proof. Years later Cicero's words and deeds were to come back to haunt him when hunted down by the triumvirate he was assassinated.<br /><br />Enter Gaius Julius Caesar a member of a noble Roman family and the greatest Roman popularis. To Parenti, Caesar is ambitious but not to the degree historians have made him to be. As a young man he rejects Sulla's offer to pledge himself to the reactionary cause putting his own life in danger. After Sulla's death in 78 BCE Caesar returns to Rome and continues his rise through the Republic's institutions. As consul he introduced land reforms to ease the burden for the lower classes gaining support among them but seriously and permanently alienating members of the ruling elite. The result was that when Caesar finally made his bid for power that resulted in his dictatorship for life he had acquired a strong faction of dissenters who looked to his overthrow.<br /><br />Parenti paints a picture of an ambitious Caesar with a program that included debt reduction, land reform for the poor, granting of citizenship to allied peoples and a conciliatory attitude to those who opposed him. Rather than an ambitious politico who wanted a crown, Caesar as dictator, in the author's view, was implementing reforms that would make the Republic more representative of the populace.His conciliatory attitude did little to dissuade his enemies' hatred of him and the outcome of the assassination comes as a reactionary response to the attacks on elite privilege rather than any defense of Republican virtues.<br /><br />To Parenti the villains are both the ruling elites whose greed incited them to oppose then finally murder Caesar and the latter historians who have bought forward the idea of Caesar as a destroyer of the Roman constitution and the lower classes as dirty masses without the ability to know what was good for them. The dictum of not imposing contemporary values on historical situations means little to Parenti, and he states it freely as he recalls the suffering of slaves and the disenfranchised. He need not have done this, the fact that reformers such as the Gracchi, Drusus Flacus, Rufus Sartininius, Clotius  and the institution of the tribune existed shows that there were contemporaries who understood the unfairness of the oligarchic Roman Republic.<br /><br />In the end \\"The Assassination of Julius Caesar\\" is necessary read for anyone interested in the fall of the Republic. Readers may not agree with Parenti's sometimes radical notions nor his attacks on historians- both ancient and modern- of that age, but this is a book that will stimulate. For its radical but intelligently argued positions and unabashed willingness to name names it is a great, intellectually stimulating work.the populace.

In an odd early segment Taylor even attempts to discredit Orwell's recollections of his days at St Cyprians which he wrote about in his famous \\"Such, Such Were the Joys\\" essay.  The author even goes so far as to make an issue of the fact that maybe, just maybe, Orwell may have ate at a relatives house while \\"down and out\\" in Paris instead of total submission to the hardships of the city . He tries to lay the groundwork for an argument that Orwell created his own personal mythology but this \\"Orwell says he did this but how could he have- I think he did...\\" approach leaves a residue of antagonism between the writer and the subject throughout the biography. One gets the feeling that perhaps the Orwell of this biography is not to be totally trusted. Certainly, this Orwell is not anyone most of us would like to be around and perhaps that is Taylor's point.<br /><br />The biography paints the portrait of a somewhat troubled eccentric man distracted by his own thoughts, who compartmentalized his friendships, and was a pathetic womanizer. Throughout the book Taylor has inserted chapter \\"interludes\\" that spend a few pages on a particular aspect of Orwell. While some of these are quite valuable their effect is to interrupt the narrative flow of the biography. I'm not sure why this wasn't addressed by an editor but the ad hoc nature of these chapters could have easily been integrated.<br /><br />Taylor attempts to analyze Orwell's writings, especially his early novels and a few important essays. In this he succeeds to some extent, but again inserts doubts about Orwell's real experiences. Strangely he barely addresses the controversial list of communist sympathizers Orwell gave to the British Information Research Department. This is a bit of a stunning omission I believe. Barely three paragraphs are dedicated to an incident that has shadowed Orwell's ghost over fifty years.<br /><br />Orwell is too important a figure to have this biography be either the standard or the last word on his life. This isn't a bad read, Taylor has a good writing style, and that does help. Readers are cautioned that there are other more objective works on Orwell's life out there and, while it gives some good information it should not be the first or only biography to seek out. What Taylor needed perhaps more than anything was a good editor with a few words of caution to avoid the pitfalls into which he so obviously fell.ncident that has shadowed Orwell's ghost over fifty years.  <br /> <br />Orwell is too important a figure to have this biography be either the standard or the last word on his life.

Lawyers often make poor historians. That might strike some as counter-intuitive as precedents are by their nature `historical'. But legal precedents are a narrow technical field and though they can encompass the political, economic and social issues of their day the legal logic and argument that surround them are usually- with some major exceptions- divorced from them.  And perhaps it's that their [the lawyer as historian] early years have been shaped by legal reasoning and in spite of exposure to history such as an undergrad or grad degree, this legal mindset often limits a more holistic approach to the subject matter.<br /><br />Not so with James F. Simon's \\"What Kind of Nation\\".  Simon writing eschews the sort of legal analysis best left to law textbooks in favor of a clear, fairly encompassing and biographically based approach.  And a fine approach it is.  With healthy portions of legal analysis but an even finer biographer's paintbrush Simon comes close to bringing to life many of the individuals and their ideological stands.<br /><br />At the center is of course Jefferson and Marshall.  Both get sympathetic, but honest treatment from Simon.  Jefferson, the idealist, strongly holding the belief that favored the limiting of government and the Federalists as the greatest threat to liberty in the young nation.  His horror at the Sedition acts and the steps taken by the Republicans are highlighted as are the equally strong beliefs and actions taken by the Federalists to implement them.<br /><br />Marshall is painted in an even finer light I think.  Perhaps it's because Jefferson's more volatile temper got the best of him at times or perhaps Marshall's nature was to be a more moderating influence, he comes across a intelligent and subtle thinker. Read his approach to Marbury, where he takes the long road to come to his final conclusion.  It was an approach that made upheld many of the Federalist tenets yet gave the victory to Jefferson. Masterfull.<br /><br />Simon does a great job in describing two important events in that era.  The first is the impeachment of Samuel Chase a justice on the Supreme Court.  Simon presents the legal arguments in clear precise prose.  But he does more than that, he describes the individuals involved-their strengths and weaknesses, the drama behind the scenes and sets it all in the context of the political mechanizations of the era.  Equally compelling is the description of Burr's fall from grace and subsequent trial for treason.  Marshall and Jefferson's role in both events are given in some detail and their rationales analyzed within the framework of the issues each was faced with.<br /><br />James F. Simon has given a well written and immensely interesting picture of the dynamics between Jefferson and Marshall and the era in which they lived.  With a clear, precise and entertaining writing style and with one foot firmly planted what seems like a historian's mindset I'm anxious to read more of his works. I would love to read a more in depth study of Chase or Burr- for example- written by Simon.<br /><br />Highly recommended.br />Simon does a great job in describing two important events in that era.

Taubman's Khruschyev: The Man and His Era is one of the few Khruschyev biographies to be published in the English language.  That's a shame, Khruschyev's denunciation of Stalin stands as the first volley in the forty year struggle to move Russia out of the grip of Stalin's legacy, his loosening of the soviet regime allowed artists to flourish and by making living standards a higher priority he sanctioned the building of housing of a higher quality [It was a revelation to me when living in St. Petersburg, Russia several of my friends and acquaintances considered the Khrushchev  era `good years'] .<br /><br />Taubman follow's Khruschyev's early years in Ukraine and his peasant and proletariat  background.  A background that would help to propel him forward in the communist party [proletariat backgrounds were given enhanced status within a party with a surprisingly large number of members who were descendent of non-proletariats].  After a very brief and potentially lethal fling with the Menshivek faction within the party he joined the Bolshevik faction run by Lenin.<br /><br />Taubman shows how Khrushchev swiftly rose through the ranks through long hours of work, strict adherence to party dictates and in spite of his meager education.  Indeed Khrushchev's real talent lay in hard work and in being able to speak with workers and peasants on their own terms instead of obtuse theoretical dialog.<br /><br />Khrushchev 's rise through party was accompanied by blood.  Ruthless in his application of party dictates in Ukraine he purged kulaks in the early `30s, sending thousands to exile, the gulag or to be killed, during the era of purges he ruthlessly hacked away at local elites.  As was usual with the Stalinist regime, families were not exempt and the arrest of a close relative could signal the arrest of the whole family. In his later years Taubman hints at the guilt that Khrushchev  seems to have carried within him over his role in the purges.  Indeed he is even quoted as admitting at one point that he was up to his elbows in blood.<br /><br />As his carrier moved along Khrushchev  was able to rise into the Politburo itself where Stalin seems to have viewed him as somewhat of a country bumpkin,  less of a threat than the lecherous Beria.  Beria himself underestimated Khrushchev  as the latter operated behind the scenes with other members to arrest and execute Beria in the months after Stalin's death finally gathering enough power to run the Soviet Union.<br /><br />What emerges is a man of volatile temperament who allowed his rise to power to overcome his common sense.  He stopped listening and began lecturing, removing all those who disagreed, although he stopped the Stalinist method of arrest and execution of the losers, being satisfied instead to force them into far lesser positions or retirement.<br /><br />In the end Khrushchev 's instabilities and often hair brained schemes alienated his closest supporters who removed him from power forcing him into retirement and hailing in an era of retrenchment of a more suppressive regime under Breshnev.  In his final years Khrushchev  worked on his memoirs and amazingly they were smuggled out of the country by his son and published in the West.<br /><br />Taubman has written a fine biography of this mercurial Soviet leader.  Well written and with interesting insight it's the best single volume on Khrushchev  published in English.point that he was up to his elbows in blood.

He stopped listening and began lecturing, removing all those who disagreed, although he stopped the Stalinist method of arrest and execution of the losers, being satisfied instead to force them into far lesser positions or retirement.      In the end Khrushchev 's instabilities and often hair brained schemes alienated his closest supporters who removed him from power forcing him into retirement and hailing in an era of retrenchment of a more suppressive regime under Breshnev.  In his final years Khrushchev  worked on his memoirs and amazingly they were smuggled out of the country by his son and published in the West.      Taubman has written a fine biography of this mercurial Soviet leader.  Well written and with interesting insight it's the best single volume on Khrushchev  published in English.	2004-09-10

Eventually it may come to pass that conventional wisdom among historians will be that there is no more influential or terrible figure in Russian history- outdoing even Ivan the Terrible, Peter the Great or Catherine the Great- than Joseph Vissarionovich Djugashvil who as a young Bolshevik took the name Stalin [Russian for steel].  The life of Stalin has been visited many times by historians, biographers, in memoirs by those who knew him.  A picture emerges of a calculating, Machiavellian paranoid committed to a state enforced regime of communism but above all committed to the elimination of real and perceived `enemies' who stood in the way of his complete grasp of power.<br /><br />Simon Montefiore has done an outstanding job in revisiting the life of Stalin viewed through the lens of his personal life.  What emerges is a more human view [if one can use that term for a man responsible for the most deaths of the 20th century] of the life of Stalin. Montefiore shows Stalin the father, the husband and the in-law.  And what an in-law he was.  Traumatized by the suicide of his second wife Nadya, Stalin becomes increasingly morose and irritated by her family.  To that end most ended up being arrested and dying within the Gulag system, rather than protecting them, their ties to Stalin and the intimacy that comes with it is responsible for their deaths.<br /><br />Montefiore highlights how the inner circle of Russia's leadership strove to guess and to carry out their leader's policies.  Stalin, the master manipulator, played his inner circle against each other.  To be within the leadership was an honor and a dangerous place.  One's fate and the fate of his family was tied to Stalin's mercurial attitude.  On several occasions his sycophants wives were arrested [Malenkov, Proskrebychev] and kept in confinement or shot with their husbands remaining on with Stalin continuing with their work.  It was not uncommon for high ranking members such as Beria, Malenkov and Kruschev to inquire with Stalin's repulsive secretary Proskrebychev on his mood before entering his office in order to brace themselves for his outbursts, outbursts that could lead to one's demise if not handled correctly. In one well-known story a famous Russian pilot and Air Force general responded to an outburst with a drunken accusation that it was Stalin's fault that planes were unsatisfactory.  Within a week he was arrested and perished within the NKVD [secret police] headquarters.<br /><br />What Montefiore draws is a man who acts much like a vindictive Georgian clan leader.  His inner circle are expected to keep the same excrutiating hours as he did- going to bed daily at 6 am- to feast with him at 2 am [Kruschev called these dinners hell] and as he grew older, to drink heavily.  No one was excused and no one wanted to allow the others much time alone with Stalin.  The irony is he kept those around him in such a state of fear that when he suffered a stroke his guards were too afraid to even enter his home to inquire about why he had not ventured out all day.<br /><br />This is an excellent study into his personal affairs and Montefiore did his homework, interviewing family members, reading correspondence and official documents.  This isn't the first Stalin biography one must visit, others by Ulam, Tucker and Deutcher are recommended.  But it does illuminate these political biographies and is certainly less `gossipy' then the entertaining Radzinsky biography of Stalin.<br /><br />Highly recommended.lin's repulsive secretary Proskrebychev on his mood before entering his office in order to brace themselves for his outbursts, outbursts that could lead to one's demise if not handled correctly.

While Russian isn't as difficult as it seems to the outsider the grammar is certainly difficult if only because of the number of conjugations and the number of exceptions to each rule.

I was lucky enough to have had someone send this great book to me while I was stationed in Iraq in 2003. I was absolutely engrossed in Watson's sometimes colorful, sometimes biased and always entertaining recounting of the discovery of DNA.<br /><br />Watson, an American originally studying physics, stumbled upon the field of biochemistry almost by accident. He seems to have been a bit of an unfocused graduate student who by chance ended up working with Crick. Countless numbers of little dead ends as well as one very big one are remembered. Of special interest is the 'political' nature of the relationships between scientists of different universities working similar aims.<br /><br />And the competition. Scientists, it seems, are as competitive as any of us. Very aware of their main rivals Watson and Crick tracked the progress of Linus Pauling and they react with glee as they discover he's made a critical error that will set his progress back indefinately. They are almost as competitive with their cross-town London rivals Marurice Wilkins and Rosalind Franklin.<br /><br />A special mention should be made of Rosalind Franklin. Some have accused Watson and Crick of stealing the Nobel Prize. Nothing was further from the truth. Watson and Crick determined the structure of DNA from the work of Wilkins and Franklin. Franklin was an unfriendly and cold person, as confirmed by co-workers, but a brilliant scientist. Watson spends several pages defending her work and wishing that she had lived so that she could share in the Noble prize [not awarded posthumously]. Any talk of Watson and Crick stealing Franklin's glory is bunk not borne out by the facts.<br /><br />The Double Helix is one of those rare science books that highlights the human element of discovery with all its foibles. I highly recommend this entertaining book.	2004-07-30

In addition to Thucydide's classic history, the editor added numerous maps, notes and other explainations to help the modern reader in following the Peloponnesian War narrative.<br /><br />Thucydides is of course necessary reading for any historian whether at an undergraduate or graduate level. He established a standard of verification of facts and actions, unlike Herodotus whose great work included much myth and commonly accepted incorrect information. Thucydides had the admittedly added advantage of being an observer to a vast amount of the goings on in during this period being himself a soldier and then a general in the Athenian army.<br /><br />Fine reading and, again, an excellent editing of the original work.	2004-07-30

This is certainly among the one or two worth getting.<br />The reader from nyc is unfortunately correct. I've lived in the Middle East [Egypt, Saudi, Kuwait, Bahrain and- last year- Iraq] and have studied Islam for several years. Violence, and in varying degrees, hate are preached on many, many pages. To say the Bible has it would be correct. To say the Bible has it to the same degree as the Quran is either plain wrong or lying. There is no New Testament-like preaching of gentleness and love, unless of course it is to OTHER muslims. Christians and Jews are to be tolerated but not trusted nor treated as friends. The other reviewers have obviously NOT read the Quran but are posting out of some deep seated outrage over something they know little of.<br />And the lot of women? Not good. I can personally attest to the maltreatment of women justified by the application of 'Quranic values'.<br />Perhaps the reader from Scotland below who spouts off about interpretations is acquainted with Sunni and Shia schools of Quranic interpretations. Especially the schools which hold that homosexual relationships between adults and out of wedlock relationships be condemned. And in these 'interpretations' relationships between adult males and male children are allowed because they are neither adults nor women.

Thankfully Gramophone reviewers are more competant at reviewing classical music than finding quality audio sponsors! The Grammophone Classical Good CD Guide is a good read but difficult for beginners to use.<br />If you're a beginner like myself, already have classical cds and you are interested in finding out whether it is referenced in the guide it is a bit of a chore if you don't know what kind of sub-genre your dealing with [choral, orchestral, instrumental, chamber etc; being a beginner I have some difficulty with classificaitons]. I spent the better part of an hour trying to find whether some cds I owned were a part of the guide. Terrible indexing. What is needed in the index is a list of players/artists with their cds.<br />Much better to use it as a guide to procure cds rather than read up on what you already own, which is it's real benefit.

Writing like a demon he cranked out several novels in two years thinking he's need to support his family after he passed on. He had been mis-diagnosed, but as a result he wrote a series of novels that are really his best works and some of the best works of the twentieth century in my opinion. \\"The Wanting Seed\\" is one of these books.<br />\\"The Wanting Seed\\" much like \\"A Clockwork Orange\\" is reminiscent of other novels of a dystopian future such as \\"1984\\" and \\"Brave New World\\". The quality of writing here by Burgess is nearly the equal of those novels. Perhaps the reason it isn't held in as high esteem is the uncomfortable theme of homosexuality wrapped up in politics that carries through the novel.<br />And what a novel. A study of Britain in decline and society in constant flux. [adult] codes replace political codes in evaluations for work and promotions. But this is short-lived. It isn't really a novel of [adult] preference because with regime change comes new and different standards.<br />Burgess has fun mixing political and social expectations and comes off giving a fairly decent commentary on society at large. \\"The Wanting Seed\\" is certainly a classic and somewhat unjustly relegated to less than great status behind the other mentioned dystopian novels of the future.<br />As with most Burgess novels at his best, this one is highly recommended.	2004-04-06

This is a political biography pure and simple. There is little personnel information on Khrushchev or on his family life. Krushchev, as the author paints him, was a more complicated man than the shoe pounding and Cuban Missile crisis botching buffoon he's remembered as in the West.<br />As an aside, in my time living in Russia I found that Khrushchev is held in somewhat high regard by Russians today [who would back the authors portrait of him as a reformist]. His time as Chairman of the party resulted in relative openness after the oppression of the Stalinist era. Under his direction there was more focus on consumer goods, on housing, a release of political prisoners and more freedom in the arts.<br />As a result of his iniciatives many of the apartments in Moscow, St Petersburg and other Russian cities date back to this era. It was he who gave the famous anti-Stalin \\"secret\\" [but deliberately leaked] speech to the XXth party congress. [It's ironic that while within the Soviet Union a freer climate was allowed to continue for a time within those countries in the Soviet sphere no anti-communist activities were allowed.]<br />The book functions well as an informative look at the rise of Khruschev through the ranks of the communist party [CPSU]. The purges of the late '30s were his fasttrack to the upper ranks of the CPSU as he took over the positions of the relieved [and usually arrested] former officials.<br />An fact-filled look at Khrushchev's political life, it promises no more than a political biography and on this it delivers. Those looking for personnel information and a gossipy narrative should look elsewhere. Those looking for political biography and insight to the rise of Nikita should be satisfied.	2004-04-03

In a country where merit is traditionally the sign of success, the influence and celebration of these social parasites is a deep disappointment. Without a lick of talent or hard work and only as a result of birth or marriage these nincompoops achieved a measure of power and influence- greatly undeserved.<br />This group of &quot;social geniuses&quot; was instrumental in Georgetown not receiving an underground Metro station fearing an overflow of &quot;undesireables&quot;. As a result of this decision twenty years ago, Georgetown has had to purchase its own buses to supplement DC's bus lines adding to the traffic. And boy what traffic. Thousands visit Georgetown every week, with no Metro Station they drive their cars creating one of the most vehicle-congested neighborhoods in the United States.

Assuming the reader has a great interest in history, Before European Hegemony is certainly one of them.<br />Abu-Lughod's excellent world systems survey details the inter-connections between pre-modern economies and societies of the era. There is also the sense of continuity between these pre-modern economic relationships and the modern era.<br />Special mention should be made of the fact that Before European Hegemony was one of the first of a new wave of economic, historical and sociological studies that de-emphasized the eurocentric histories that came before them. Guilty of the same simplistic approaches the eurocentric histories were charged with, for example giving the only reason for the rise of the West as military might, much of what followed Before European Hegemony was, in a word, garbage. Not so, this groundbreaking study.<br />Well researched, well written and highly recommended.	2004-03-16

Guderian was the prime architect of the invasion of France and after being relieved by Hitler was then called back to service as Inspector of Panzer Forces in 1943.<br /><br />Guderian's theories are still in effect today in slightly different manifestations and are mainly used by the US Army's Armored Warfare doctrine. As a witness to modern armor tactics in Desert Storm and the 3rd Infantry Divisions drive north into Iraq in 2003- complete with German style 'reconnaissance in force' forays, I'd go so far as to say the the Army's Armored operational doctrine is a direct descendent of both Guderian and Von Manstein.<br /><br />Guderian's Panzer Leader is without a doubt, a required read for anyone interested in the military history of WWII.	2004-03-16

As such it's a good snapshot of the ideals that drove globalization and a decent primer on why free trade is still one of the important issues of the day.<br />Although a bit lightweight at times (it is a journalist's depiction after all), but very readable it's also still very relevant, even more so perhaps in a post-9/11 world full of \\"Clash of Civilizations\\" rhetoric. Free trade leads to intertwined economies and shared interests in the future. Economies build and produce what they do best in a perfect globalized world economy. Freidman is at his best when he points out globalizations benefits to the third world and the world in general.<br />The major criticism that can be leveled at \\"Lexus\\" is that Freidman downplays the negative side of globalization. But that isn't the point of \\"Lexus\\". It's strong pro-globalization cheerleading is firmly rooted in spirit in real world economics.<br />I find myself in agreement with Feidman's overall attitude, but hold a skeptical reservation for the negatives that can and do sometimes accompany globalization. While those negatives don't approach the apocalyptic baloney that the fervid anti-globalization crowd spews, they're real enough that they need to be addressed.	2004-03-15

Nowhere is this more apparent than in A Prayer for Owen Meany. Building his main characters and surrounding them in &quot;Dickensian&quot; situations, Irving constructs a compelling world that pulls the reader in spite of the fact that the political commentary seems out of place.<br />The story is a wonderful, if flawed, telling of friendship, the meaning of God and of fate. As usual his characters are the strong point. He masterfully constructs them in front of you and in doing so creates a connection between the reader and the novel. Irving succeeds because Owen Meany is not-at first- a likeable character that you can sympathize with, but the strength of the writing is such that eventually you do.<br />Unfortunately there are two flaws that keep this from attaining the status of clasic. First is the subplot about Vietnam adn Reagan. The works in effect to date the novel and puts the reader in several camps depending on their politics. While this isn't a drawback in some novels the partisan views of the main character seem inappropriate to the main storyline of the book. The main character, the narrator John, is the weakest in the book (as some reviewers have already mentioned). His subplot on Toronto and the exposition of his political views serve to detract rather than add anything.<br />In the end this is a worthwhile read but not the stuff of classics.	2003-07-31

At his best his strange worlds contains deeply humanistic themes and even at his worst Vonnegut is a very readable writer weaving higher themes in a deceptively simplistic style.<br />Written as a reflection of the horror he witnessed while a POW during the bombing of Dresden, Vonnegut viewed this novel as a cathardic artistic release. Like most of his novels on the surface it seems a cartoonlike simplistic story. And as with most of his books beneath this exterior lay common Vonnegut themes. It's only at the end when we realize how the main character's experience at Dresden is the cause of his \\"alien visitations\\".<br />Vonnegut's message is clear, at least for Billy: One person is pwerless to change things in this world and the best one can dois to focus on the good things. It's a deeply pessemistic view, adn Vonnegut has always acknowledged this viewpoint. But read on another level it's about the effect of war on the human psyche. One either faces its stupidity, acknowledges the pain and sufering or one becomes life Billy and finds other means to cope.<br />Slaughterhouse Five is a great read and I highly recommend it.	2003-07-31

While the focus of the later is soviet urban life the focus here falls squarely on the agrarian Soviet Union in the 1930's.<br />This is an eye-opening look at the effect of collectivization at the village level. The famine of the early '30's- not the main focus- is shown to have been more the case of poor planning, beauracratic ineptitude and peasant reactions against collectivization rather than a diabolical program of systematic starvation.<br />Post Soviet studies into the Stalinist era confirm the fact that non-party and non-technocratic wrokers who were not Kulaks were much safer from the pograms raging around them. The effect of this was that Kholhozes were constantly replacing managers and technicians caught up in the latest round up of wreckers, this in turn led to confusion and declining morale among the peasants.<br />The peasants are contrasted with the urban vanguards who flooded the rural kholhoz's who were filled with communist fervor. These vanguards were resented and looked down upon as interlopers and outsiders by the local farm workers. Fitzgerald does great work showing how peasants retained their religious beliefs in the face of communist pressure and their passive resistance to constant pressures from the central government to accomodate the latest decrees.<br />Just as in Everyday Stalinism, Fitzgerald's work here is excellent. This isn't for the novice reader but a great resource for those who are already knowledgeable on the Soviet Union in the 1930's.	2003-07-29

Coatzee's novel of a nameless frontier administrator of a nameless empire is a moral parable of the last century.<br />Coatzee evokes the shadowy fear of barbarians who never really appear to elicit responses from his characters, whether the main protagonist, villagers or the imperial representatives, who seem more an enemy themselves. Through a long series of moral choices the magistrate finds himself at the bottom socially and financially with redemptive powers he never knew he possessed. The early relationship with a barbarian peasant is loaded with meaning but Coatzee is such an excellent writer that his passages flow with an ease that escapes other authors saying a lot less.<br />I highly recommend &quot;Waiting for the Barbarians&quot;. This is a writer at his best and serious readers won't be disappointed.	2003-07-19

The irreverence, flippancy and zaniness of his characters (and writing) mask deeper questions of religion and the nature of human faults.<br />In answer to Christianity and all religions one of Vonnegut's characters creates his own and falls prey to it. Bokononism is one of the great and funny creations of late 20th century literature. It's founder is one of the main characters within Cat's Cradle and never makes a real appearance until the last page and only then to deliver a message to &quot;Jonah&quot;.<br />Vonnegut risked getting out of control in this novel, but somehow he's able to balance everthing, keep the reader involved and make a statement. Unlike other &quot;hip&quot; novels of the '60s, Cat's Cradle holds up well in our decade.	2003-07-19

Burgess makes the typical black and white judgements more difficult for us.<br />But Clockwork Orange's genius is more than this. Burgess injects Russian words into his gang of toughs creating a lower class dialect . Knowing Russian makes the book much easier to read yet defeats the authors purpose- he wants the reader to determine the word meanings by context.<br />Clockwork Orange is a darkly comic work that stands as one of the best books of the twentieth century.	2003-07-19

There are a total of thirty-eight different articles by as many authors. Edited by Turi Munthe it is divided into three parts. The first dedicated to the Saddam's rise to power and his early years, the second part focuses on the Gulf War period  while the last deals with the post-Gulf War regime.<br />It's unfortunate that the Saddam Hussein Reader starts off with the interview of Saddam by Fuad Matar. While interesting in its own way it goes on far too long and is ultimately a PR fluff piece by a pro-Saddam journalist. The rest of the section is quite good. Especially notable are Said Aburish's excerpt from the Politics of Revenge, Ofra Bengio's analysis of his Arab viewpoint and Charles Tripp's analysis of the Iran Iraq war. Avia Shiaim offers up a genuine critique of US policy towards Iraq in the 1970's that supported the Iraqi Ba'athist  party .<br />Part II dealing with the Gulf War offers several articles from all across the political spectrum.  Especially noteworthy is Saddam's own call to Jihad against the US coalition and a counter \\"Fatwa\\" by Muslims against the Iraqi regime's invasion of Kuwait.  John Esposito's analysis of Islam and the Gulf War has a lot to commend it as well.<br />The final portion deals with the post Gulf War era in Iraq, options for ridding it of Saddam and arguments against US involvement.  All in all this is an excellent selection of articles which range from anti-Saddam to pro-Arab to anti-US. From US military officers to Israeli Academicians to Arab activists like Edward Said to left wing icons like Noam Chomsky and Saddam himself there is something for (or against) everyone.<br />An excellent collection of articles and highly recommended.	2003-02-17

The English used is a bit archaic; what the King James version is to the bible I would say is what the Pickthall version is to the Qur'an.

The inherent problem with the translation of Eden takes place in the first half of the novel where there is a stiffness to the wording used. In the beginning of Eden the translator seems to have chosen the most obscure word or phrase possible to substitute for original Polish. Thankfully as the novel progresses so does its readability as the translator hits his stride about 1/3 of the way through.<br />Using the theme of alien contact, Lem's Eden is superficially similar to his classic Solaris. Scientists and crew from a ship crash land and are stranded. They survive in the midst of a strange world upon which is an even stranger civilization. The crew sets out to explore and decipher the culture of the planet and like Solaris it's not a question of misunderstanding but a more basic question of determining what it is they are observing.<br />Eden doesn't reach the heights of personal philosophical musings that Solaris does. And while the characters are one-dimensional they work well within the framework of a story whose central theme is less what makes us human than how that humanity shapes our perceptions. If you like Stanilslaw Lem or a fan of SF you'll find Eden a rewarding novel and worth your time.	2003-02-15

The strengths are that he himself took part to a large extent in dealings with the Iraqi regime during the decade of the Iraq/Iran war. Aburish's insights and commentary are invaluable. The weaknesses in the book become readily apparent. Said has some duplicity in the regimes attempted acquisition of a nuclear [device] and other weapons of mass destruction. Said is also anti American and anti British. When he addresses US involvement in the Gulf War his arguments become tirades against Saddam , the US and Britain. It's his very ant-US and British attitude that make Aburish's recommendation for dealing with the Iraqi regime nothing but a mechanism for the continuation of oppression by Saddam and the so called Ba'athists.<br />Aburish's own involvement in the regime and view of the US aside, I highly recommend this biography of Saddam Hussein. He sets right many misconceptions about the Iraqi dictator. His mother was not a prostitute and Saddam didn't commit [destruction] at the age of  15. These myths and other myths are dispelled. What Aburish does is to emphasize the tribalness of Saddam by setting it in the context of Arab culture. Saddam becomes less a madman than a ruthless tribal leader for whom you are either with the tribe or against it. Opposition to the regime is treated like a blood feud. Even Saddam's affinity for Stalin makes sense. Both were the sons of poor peasants widowers in semi-tribal societies (Stalin was ethnically Georgian not Russian) and both used control of the bureaucracy to help in gaining control of power.<br />In spite of its weaknesses The Politics of Revenge is a highly readable and informative.	2003-02-15

The bulk of this volume is made up of Orwell's \\"As I Please\\" column in the left wing Tribune where he was employed as editor for the later part of WWII. These are excellent insights into British life during the war era and into the political culture of the British left of which Orwell was a member.<br /><br />His column's musings range from commentary on political pamphlets to the effects of the war on clothing and food. Orwell, ever the socialist, sees everything through the prism of class structure and to those who only know of his writings co-opted by the right such as \\"Animal Farm\\" and \\"1984\\" his definite left wing stance may come as a bit of a shock. He was by no means a dogmatic ideologue. The left gets the benefit of his often scathing criticisms as well as the right. Always willing to call things as he saw them, Orwell made enemies on both sides of the political spectrum.<br /><br />Included in volume III as well are several letters to friends and acquaintances that are political and literary in nature rather than personal. Especially noteworthy is the first essay in the volume \\"The English People\\", a rather famous piece on culture, language and class.<br /><br />I highly recommend this volume as well as the preceding volume II \\"My Country Left or Right\\". Orwell's essays are wonderful windows into the mind of one of the most important individuals of the twentieth century.	2002-11-26

For some irresponsible and bizarre reason, publishing house Faber and Faber who own the license have not authorized a direct from Polish translation of Solaris. The good news is that despite this the translators from the French have a good sense of literary style and did a fine job of making it readable and enjoyable, though obviously not as accurate a translation as could be.<br />At first glance Solaris seems hard science fiction. Set in the future after man has explored many systems the main character arrives at the space station orbiting the planet Solaris. Lem lets us know several things up front, the planet is suspected of being an intelligent life form and there is a long history of exploration, strange happenings and accidents that have occurred. By the time Kelvin arrives after almost two hundred years of study only a small team is left to record and study the planet.<br />More than hard science is really at the heart of this novel. There are musings on alien contact and the nature of what is intelligence. Is man really the measure of everything? As events occur, Kelvin the rational scientist succumbs to those most irrational of feelings, love and longing. Ironically, Kelvin, the person sent to investigate the occurrences among the crew is the one who is emotionally effected the most by the visitors that accompany everyone.<br />The genius of the novel is that the visitors are reflections or copy's of each individual in each person's memory. Every character is touched (or disturbed) on a level much deeper than a more conventional alien contact approach. Few readers will fail to imagine who from their own memories would take the form of their own visitor.<br />This is one of the most intelligent science fiction novels I've read in a long time. The story ends up not being about science but about what makes us human, what is intelligence and what may separate us from another life form. Moving, well written and highly recommended.science but about what makes us human, what is intelligence and what may separate us from another life form.

In many ways it's a superior biography because of it. The reader is exposed to the educational and early vocational world that shaped Jefferson's outlook.<br />Jefferson's study of law is interesting in itself. His own experience in the legal field is contrasted with other early founding fathers such as Patrick Henry who, also a lawyer, followed a different avenue towards the law which was more bombastic and less founded on legal realities. The early legal education is important because much of his later writings are extensions of ideas accepted within common law. Also important is his time as a real estate lawyer, which influenced heavily his concept of private property and speculation.<br />There is a lot to cover in a biography of Jefferson, his years as governor of Virginia, as ambassador to France, the building of Monticello, architect of the Declaration of Independence and founder of UVA. Randall does well with this overwhelming task. Jefferson left a large amount of writings in letters, journals, articles and books that should make a biographer's job easier, but in reality has had them scratching their heads attempting to read the nuances and subtleties of his beliefs.<br />\\"Thomas Jefferson: A Life\\" is a worthwhile, rewarding read and an excellent starting point for introduction into his fascinating life.	2002-11-21

In the best of her writing, such as \\"Battle for God\\", she aimed her criticism and analysis equally towards the fundamentalist offshoots of the three monotheistic religions. The results were a book that gave great insight into the fundamentalism, its roots and causes.<br /><br />Unfortunately \\"Holy War\\" is marked by an extreme lack of balance on Karen Armstrong's part. Christianity, and especially Catholicism are the targets of an almost pathological attack on her part. Much of \\"Holy War\\" smacks of that mea culpa \\"The West is bad the east is good\\" variety of history so popular in historical writing of the 1980's and `90's. Christianity is painted in a dark light and, usually, while Armstrong is correct in her criticisms of the stupidity of the military leaders she goes too far in laying the blame for today's problems at the feet of Christianity and the crusades. Armstrong, an ex-nun who left the Catholic Church, has an axe to grind and she grinds it forcefully.<br />Armstrong paints Muslims as generally innocent victims who treated Christians and Jews as \\"people of the book\\". The fact that Muslims taxed them for the \\"right\\" to maintain their worship (sometimes heavily) and generally were contemptuous of both Christianity and Judaism isn't mentioned even though there is ample historical evidence for this (re: Muslim Discovery of Europe by Bernard Lewis). Nor does the fact that Muslims slaughtered pagans who refused to convert to Islam, showing its own unsavory past, rank any mention by Armstrong. In \\"Holy War\\" Islam is a peaceful progressive sect forced into violence and backwardness by the advent of European crusades.<br />Armstrong is a great writer of history and does her research, but some of her sources are suspect- using Paul Johnson as a reliable source in any history is always a gamble. Karen Armstrong's later writings are much more balanced than \\"Holy War\\". In all it is still an entertaining, informative and rewarding book but one which the reader should approach with some caution.ewarding book but one which the reader should approach with some caution.	2002-11-21

Well written in its way it tells the story of the dissolute, self absorbed life of Sebastian Dangerfield, an American expat in Ireland.<br /><br />I didn't find much comedy in Ginger Man although there are some perfect lines within it. One especially comical line is in response to the nature of morals and Catholicism, to paraphrase: Jesus is a good idea but they're killing him with publicity. Ginger Man also contains some- for the time- graphic scenes of sexuality that resulted in its being banned in the US for some years.<br />There isn't a lot that I found funny in the way Dangerfield approached his family or other women. He's generally drunk, on the prowl and out of money. But JP Donleavy is a good writer and there is something in his style and the story that keeps the reader engaged. I guess it's similar to watching a train wreck, you're sorry it had to happen but you can't take your eyes off of it.<br />I did enjoy Ginger Man but was at a loss to figure out why there really wasn't much in the way of resolution. If you're looking for a story of redemption or a Saul on the road to Damascus epiphany from the main character you'll be disappointed. Perhaps that was Donleavy's intent, that sometimes there isn't resolution.<br />All in all The Ginger Man is a well-written and engaging story which will delight some readers and disappoint those looking for a morality tale.	2002-11-05

Robert Utley has done a fine job of bringing to life the average tempo and quality of the US Army on the frontier.<br /><br />Utley uses memoirs and Army records as sources for his descriptions of military life. I was especially interested in his detailed accounts of how company commanders, platoon leaders and senior NCOs conducted themselves. There is one account describing how the CDR, 1st SGT and officers would make copies of documents during their daily staff meetings that is quite interesting. Having attended scores of company level meetings it struck me how much things have both stayed the same and how other things have changed.<br />There is a substantial amount devoted to the low quality of enlisted soldiers and the day-to-day hardships of camp life. Foodstuffs weren't always provided by the Army and isolated units had to scramble to come up with rations for the troops. This lead to moneymaking ventures, small plots of produce and other creative \\"financing\\" to supply the soldiers.<br />Interesting, well written and recommended.	2002-11-05

Griffith's main argument seems to be that the Civil War was waged in a manner closer to the Napoleonic Wars than to modern ones. Other arguments challenge the &quot;for the first time in history&quot; school of the Civil War noting that little of what occurred was unkown in the European experience. Trench warfare wasn't new; ask the Roman legions or the Brits, French and Russians of the Crimean war (read Tolstoy's &quot;Sevastopol Sketches&quot; for a view of trench warfare circa 1854).<br />This is the sort of history long overdue for the CW era. Much of the field is overflowing with hyperbole and lack of analysis of the CW's place in world military history. Griffith does good work in pointing out the operational and training deficiencies that took place. The regular army, small in size, was never used as a training template to fill out the huge force that was to follow. The volunteer army that emerged because of that deficiency shaped the steep learning curve of officers and enlisted.<br />The engineering branch of the army comes in for special criticism. West Point's basic education consisted of military engineering as the foundation for military training. It was this fortification mentality that Griffith holds responsible for the length and causality count of the CW. In a related vein, French military thought, so influencial at West Point, is given some fairly negative print.<br />The book has several problems. The level of rigorous research seems suspect at times and for more the more technical aspects such as weaponry Griffith's analysis falters. His criticism of the cavalry's lack of participation as a fully effective combat arm is subject to much criticism itself, though he scores many points with a perceptive analysis of the artillery arm's subjugation to the infantry at the expense of tactical efficiency.<br />Much of Griffith analysis on infantry battles, especially rifles and other weaponry, has been criticized fiercely by CW buffs. Be that as it may, there is a lot that is still worthwhile in this book and it deserves a fair reading.ponry, has been criticized fiercely by CW buffs.

While it isn't perfect, its strengths more than make up for the shortcomings in the story. Ted Daniels has created an excellent universe. This is what science fiction at it's best. Most of what is here is feasible, unbelievable to some extent, but feasible.<br />One thousand years in the future nano-technology and computer technology have altered the nature of humanity and changed the solar system. Humans can make virtual copies of themselves and inhabit non-biological states if they choose. But human nature stays the same, the old jealousies, prejudices and craving for power still remain. The story takes on a \\"civil war\\" nature between different groups with different visions occurring within the solar system.<br />It's not a perfect novel. The antagonist, Ames, is a cookie-cutter bad guy with little real emotional complexity, a psychopath really. I wish that Daniels would have spent time at the beginning giving a social history of the nature of the virtual change in society and the philosophical arguments brewing for much of the question involved in Metaphysical is: What constitutes a human being? Sadly, I think this was a lost opportunity to make this a classic of SF that it had the potential to be. (I also agree with many others that a definition of terms would certainly have helped, only by staying with the first seventy pages was I able to begin to make sense of what was happening.)<br /><br />Still, a great SF novel that stretches the bounds of reality and what might be.	2002-10-09

This is a landmark study on the building of an industrial city in the Soviet Union during the Stalinist era. It's extremely bizarre that some have taken the view that it is a pro-Stalin work. I can only conclude that they haven't read Magnetic Mountain but only certain reviews or are so head-in-the-sand dogmatic that they render any view outside of cold war totalitarian model as pro-Stalinist.<br />Especially ironic is the Stalinist tone of many who oppose any view outside this strict cold war construction. Like it or not the facts are many who lived in the Soviet Union during that era believed in communism as their salvation and future. I've lived in Russia and have seen the older generation protesting in pro-Stalin demonstrations in St Petersburg's Palace Square. Stating this doesn't make Kotkin pro anything. It makes him a historian.<br />Kotkin's rendering of Magnitogorsk is great history. From the initial idealistic workers that established the city, he quickly shows the disillusionment that occurred when theory and practical organization clashed. Labor shortages abound in this workers paradise ironically because workers couldn't stand the conditions. Kotkin shows how internal passports and party cards gradually began to be used to make sure workers could not move freely or that party members could be monitored.<br />Not that all was oppression. He correctly describes how many used the opportunities that were available to proceed with gaining an education in the evening technical programs that proliferated in the Magnitogorsk community.<br />Kotkin does not shy away from the effects of the purges, but he does describe them as being focused particularly on party members. With the benefits of communist party membership came the dangerously increased odds of being targeted in the purges. He's especially effective in his description of how the balance of power was structured between the technical experts running the factories, the local communist organization and the NKVD.<br />This is good history. It may ruffle feathers, but more importantly it illuminates the complexity of life in the Soviet Union. Citizens in the SU were much more involved, benefited from and bought into the dogma of Soviet marxism much more than the Conquest cold war scholarship of that era showed.

Whatever the criticisms that have been made of her stewardship of Orwell's legacy, these four volumes contain much of the best of Orwell's essays, letters and diary excerpts. This volume covers the early war years and much of the writing is shaded by that war.<br />This is Orwell at his finest, on one hand a confirmed socialist dedicated to fighting the right whether the Tory party or fascism; one the other hand an anti-Stalinist and critic of the left and always an anti-totalitarian.<br />Contained within \\"My Country Right or Left\\" is some of Orwell's best writing. In \\"Pacifism and the War\\", a notorious piece at the time, he accuses pacifists of aiding the fascist cause. \\"The Art of Donald McGill\\" is an essay about, of all things, postcards that are popular among the middle and lower classes. The postcards themselves, Orwell argues, say much about England's political and social attitudes. It's actually a perceptive piece of pop art and social commentary. Among my favorites is the essay concerning Mark Twain (Mark Twain- Licensed Jester). Orwell, a great admirer of Twain's, is critical of him for not being forceful enough in his social criticism. He accusation is that Twain pulls his punches far too often. It's a great piece of criticism and is Orwell at his finest.<br />What holds a large amount of this Volume together are the letters to the Partisan Review, a New York publication that contracted with Orwell to write commentary on England during this early war period. The issues vary from English politics, reflections on the clothing worn by the masses, attitudes towards democracy and so on. All well written, never dull and very often wrong in their predictions. There is much more here including excerpts from his diary, letters to other major figures of the day and reflections on the Spanish Civil War.<br />This is some of the greatest essay writing in the English language. Even sixty years later the essay's read clearly and give insight to Orwell's thinking.language. Even sixty years later the essay's read clearly and give insight to Orwell's thinking.	2002-09-25

The third and final novel in McAuley's telling of the Confluence is a mixed bag with a beginning similarly well written, but an ending that is unsatisfying to the reader.<br />McAuley seems to compress far too much in Shrine of Stars, rather than let the story build it's way to a finale, he jams so many scenarios and near misses that the reader becomes a little jaded towards the end. Time after time the antagonist(s) reappear after you think they have been eliminated. The effect is that you're never surprised that another antagonist shows up again (in fact the question becomes: which one will appear next?).<br />But most importantly McAuley lets the reader down. After almost three books where Yama looks for his human bloodline, the results are disappointing and not really worthy of the buildup the author coaxes the reader to expect.<br />One wants to know more about humanity: what happened, why and so on. Instead the meeting becomes another mini-adventure in a trilogy of mini-adventures that ends in disaster for humans. And still there's no really fulfilling explaination of the past. After three novels what a disappointment! The ultimate end is of an unsatisfying &quot;loop of time&quot; variety.<br />There is a part in Shrine of Stars where Dimas tells Yama that he can tell him all about the history of humanity, why Confluence exists and what exactly happened. Yama's reply is that he doesn't want to know.<br />Yama might not want to know, but the reader does.	2002-09-21

Since he is a classical and military historian he's written this interpretation of military battles as seen through a cultural prism. To a large extent he's succeeded in presenting a valid case albeit with a few flaws. Simply put, it's individual freedom, scientific inquiry, organization and discipline that are the hallmarks of Western success. Not a bad argument, but still one that is by no means airtight.<br />One of the great weaknesses in Carnage and Culture in fact is the author's irritating habit of driving the same point over and over. By the end of the first chapter the reader understands that yes, Hanson thinks it's freedom that is at the core of Western success. Unfortunately he doesn't stop there and if there is any drawback to this work it's the incessant pounding away at that theme.<br />Especially noteworthy are three chapters. The first is the Battle of Lepanto in the 16th century. The description of the cutting edge technologically superior ships of the Venetians is excellently done. Christian admirals were from several different countries and states and bickered up until the eve of the battle on tactics. Nevertheless they submitted to on Admiral once the attack began. The crushing defeat of the Turks wasn't followed up, but it took them years to put another navy of any numbers back on the sea.<br />The chapter on Cortez is simply the best in the book. An easily unlikable figure, Cortez was an excellent judge of the tactical situations he found himself in. Hanson doesn't shy away from showing the cruelty of the Spaniards towards the natives but he also honestly and fairly shows the Mexicas (Aztecs) as the cruel overseers of their own empire. The gulf between the Western way of war and the rest of the world is probably most starkly drawn here.<br />Lastly, Rourke's Drift, while an odd choice, is probably the second best chapter. A great description of the events that a occurred and of the British colonial and Zulu armies is given.<br />Although obvious at the beginning, Hanson really begins to show he has an axe to grind in the last two chapters, a particularly conservative axe at that. It's unfortunate that he does this. Carnage and Culture works best when Hanson sticks to military history and steers clear from political polemics. In spite of that drawback this is an excellent work and highly recommended.chapter.

He doesn't always succeed in a coherent integrated presentation of strategy, operations, or tactics and leaves out much that is important. As a writer of many popular military histories- but certainly not a hack- it's surprising that so much of his work varies greatly in quality from the excellent \\"Face of Battle\\" to lesser works.<br />The First World War has much to commend and as much to criticize. Keegan does a good job at presenting the global aspects of this essentially European war. I enjoyed his discussion of the German navy's exploits in the Pacific theater and the efforts to hunt down their ships.<br />Several times in the book individuals appear-briefly- and then disappear without an explaination. Belgian King Albert is touted as a brave man of honor in one paragraph, then two pages later disappears completely from the narrative. Not a sentence given to explain his leadership of the Belgian army in exile or its triumphant return, surprising in light of his extolling of Albert just a few pages earlier.<br />On another occassion Keegan mentions, but fails to explain, the British New Army; its difference from the profession British army and the contempt the \\"regulars\\" held for them. An extremely important matter because one of the reasons for the high casualties in early years was Haig's staff opinion that the New Army recruits wouldn't be able to conduct attacks under cover of rolling barrages or learn assault tactics. Instead he spends time discussing the fighting qualities of a handful of Indian divisions while ignoring the larger issue of the New Army's place in the culture of the professional leadership.<br />Curiously, Keegan barely addresses the development of new military technologies such tanks and aircraft (he does write much on gas technology). Little or no time is spent discussing their development, tactical theories of deployment or improvements in training and design.<br />Most glaring of all is what seems like an apologia for the high command and the brutal slaughter of millions of soldiers. Those in the trenches, commanders and soldiers at platoon, company and battalion level knew the futility of the tactics being used.<br />These are but a few examples of the problems with this book. It appeals to popular readership, but those more knowledgable about the Great War will be disappointed.

In much the same vein Jonathan Franzen delves into the lives of the Lamberts, a typical midwestern family with a pair of imperfect parents and three dysfunctionally operating grown children. P>What sets this novel apart from other, for lack of a better way of putting it- \\"Oprah\\" novels- is the way the approach to the Lamberts is connected to the era which we live in, beyond just the commonality of family strife and dysfunction. There are serious themes in this book just below the surface.<br />But Franzen doesn't draw his characters without a vast amount of compassion.  His writing, or better, his \\"connection\\" with his characters has improved immensely since his \\"Twenty Seventh City\\" novel. In the same vein this novel has been compared to Don De Lillo's \\"White Noise\\".  In my opinion Franzen's compassion and connection to his characters is far superior than De Lillo's, though \\"White Noise\\" is a more comical story.<br />In an age when there seem to be very few great novels \\"The Corrections\\"- though maybe not the \\"great novel\\" of our time-  comes as close to that title as anything I've read in the last ten years.	2002-09-05

The biography covers the whole of Orwell's life, including his socialist but anti-Stalinist left wing beliefs, time fighting for the Anarchist/Trotskyite POUM in the Spanish Civil War, lifelong battle over his health and his infatuation with various women as he grew older.<br />In our time Orwell has been claimed by the right wing (something that would have appalled him) yet Meyers shows his definite, though rocky, affiliation with Englands leftist movements which he kept to the end of his life. Another pervasive element is Orwell's constant money problem's finally resolved, ironiclly, when he was literally on his deathbed.<br />For clarity of writing this biography can't be criticized.  It reads quickly because the style is so straightforward. Meyers, who's written several biographies, is certainly a master at his craft.  I'd recommend this as a good read and overview of Orwell's literary and personal life.  Good biography.	2002-08-30

Based solely on Sassoon's life in the trenches of WWI, it recounts the horror and scale of carnage that occurred. More importantly it shows the emotionally scars that the survivors carried with them as a result of exposure.<br />Sherston (Sassoon) was a rather spoiled and pampered young upper class Englishman. The war changed all that. Confronted with death, destruction and idiotic leadership from the High Command you sense the inner turmoil of Sherston.<br />Relieved when he is not involved with the fighting he is driven by guilt over the loss of the soldiers in his battalion. Consequently when his platoon is on the line he takes great risks in reconaissance of the German positions.<br />The effects of non-stop total war, stupid leadership and the complete contrast between England and the trenches (only a few hundred miles apart) is staggering to Sassoon. Sassoon becomes anti-war and considers becoming an objector, but his obvious connection to his comrades and loyalty to them wins out in the end. He hates the war but won't abandon his comrades in the field.<br />This is a great war memoir written by a poet who survived and was changed for life by his experiences in it.	2002-08-30

Gates, who, by common consent is seen as a brilliant is shown (also by common consent) as an emotionally immature individual who genuinely believes that what Microsoft is doing a good thing for everyone and seems to think that laws do not have the final say in matters over his company.<br />I came away with the feeling that if Microsoft had dealt with the allegations by co-operating with the Anti-trust division early on and with total honesty this may not have ever been a front page story. But the stubborness of Gate's personality, his inability to compromise almost guaranteed this would become a major newstory and legal case.<br />There's a lot to be commended here.  Auletta has interviewed literally all the key players, poured through the legal record and has some keen insights that are both his own and garnered from interviews.  I really enjoyed World War 3.0 and don't believe you need to be a lawyer to understand the issues at hand.	2002-08-30

Picking up this book you may think you've got a hold of a historiography of some sort or other. It isn't, but you won't be disappointed.<br />Paul Fussel has written an excellent literary history of the effects of the Great War on the intelligensia of early twentieth century England. The great writers and poets of the age who fought, sometimes died, in the struggle, wrote their poetry and prose.<br />Through it Fussel explores the effects of the war not only on the writers but on the society which they came from. The tremendous slaughter (250,000 lost in a few weeks attempting to take the village of Passchendale, over 800,000 in the battle of the Somme), the stupidity of the British leadership (\\"Lions led by donkeys\\" said Churchill of the Army) and the ravaged psyches of the survivors.<br />All this led to the war's impact on the poetry and writing of the survivors. Men like Robert Graves, Siegfried Sassoon, Edward Blunden and others poured their experiences out on paper. Fussel analyzes them and compares them with writers before the Great War and with writers effected by World War II.<br />In the 25th anniversary edition of this book Fussel reflects that he wishes he'd not relied on older forms of literary criticism. I disagree, while he doesn't use any elements of post-modern criticism in his work, by not using it the work remains timeless.<br />Works like this are rare. Intelligent and literary, The Great War and Modern Memory really does stand alone. The Modern Library ranked it as one of the best 100 non-fiction works of the twentieth century. They'll get no argument from me.	2002-08-30

Here he has written a war memoir which ranks in the same league as Orwell's \\"Homage to Catalonia\\".<br />Honest and open to a fault, he chronicles his upbringing in the English public schools system and his dislike of hypocrisy.  This antagonism he will carry with him throughout his period in the trenches.<br />Graves' vivid portrayal of life in the trenches is second to none.  He recounts the endless routine of trench life with its boredom and the terror of attack and German shelling.  Held up to special scorn is the sheer stupidity of the higher command and its insistence on wasting the lives of officers and men.<br />Graves successful attempt at convincing a military board to go easy on his friend and writer Siegfried Sassoon is an amazing segment in itself (Sassoon wrote a pacifist tract while at the same time leading his infantry company with- by all accounts- great courage).<br />His description of the effects of life in the trenches is well written.  Neurosthania (shell-shock) was the 19th century term before post-traumatic disorder was coined.  The portrayal of it is vivid, not in a clinical way, but in the way Graves writes about himself and his comrades as they adjust to civilian life.<br />Everything before Graves life seems a prologue to the war, and everything after an epilogue.  What an great and important book this is.	2002-08-14

He was trained as a journalist and became an editor for several years at the New Statesman (an English publication).  He has never been trained as a historian nor has he conducted what might be called peer reviewed research in his numerous writings.<br />The fact that Johnson is not a historian wouldn't really be an issue except in the case of Modern Times.  Why is this an issue?  Because by many Modern Times has taken on the aura of gospel as a history of the twentieth century.  Johnson relies quite heavily on various sources which he himself takes as gospel without vetting them for accuracy or bias.<br />That's unfortunate.  His writing is absolutely riveting.  The problem with Modern Times is that it really isn't a history per se, it's a political opinion piece written as a history.  And as an opinion piece it isn't bound by the parameters of accuracy and unbiased critical thought.<br />Not to say many of his opinions are without merit that would be untrue.  He makes many good observations about the general effects of the theory of relativity, Freud etc and their effect ont the political and cultural psyche.<br />His main fault, and a great one it is, is that he relies on faulty data.  Whether in his biographies of Gandhi or Lenin or when he calls Francisco Franco a &quot;great man&quot; Johnson has relied soley on biased data without balancing.  Calling Franco a great man is in itself an astounding comment when he is commonly accepted, even by conservative Spaniards, as an extremely mediocre individual.  His mistakes are countless; dates are given which do not correspond with the actual events, he often attributes incorrect comments to individuals and on and on.<br />As a political opinion piece this is great writing whether you agree with Johnson or not. As a history, based upon faulty or just wrong sourcing, it fails miserably.  And that's the tragedy of its popularity as a world history.<br />The job of a historian is to present the truth and let the chips fall where they may.  Unfortunately Johnson has chosen to present opinion as fact far too often for this to be a reliable guide as a history.

Bulgakov's Master and Margarita is one of the best novels to have come out of Russia in the twentieth century. Written during the repression of the Stalinist '30s Bulgakov literally risked his life to write this.  In fact it wasn't published until 26 years after his death, even then in abreviatted form.<br />I won't add to what others have said of the substance of the novel except it operates on a personal, political and theological levels.  From each reading you'll take something from this gem.<br />I have read both the Glenny and the Burgin/O'Connor translations(My Russian is only at an intermediate level so I did not attempt it in its native tongue).  Glenny's translation is extremely readable and flows like great literature.  He does make mistakes in his choice of words but you won't go wrong with it. It was the version that got me hooked on Bulgakov.<br />Burgin/O'Connor come very close to Bulgakov's Russian with the added bonus of notes and an essay at the back of the novel.  While less flowing than Glenny it's more accurate and also a wonderful read.  Grab a copy of either and you won't be sorry.<br />One of the great books of the 20th century.	2002-08-06

Set in mid-19th century Russia it follows a few weeks in the lives of two young men, Arkadi and Bazarov.

Turgenev takes the pair on a journey through rural Russia. Each stop along the journey sets up the scenario for the tensions and revelations of the characters.<br />The character of Bazarov is one of the most vivid characters in literature.

Tragically he destroyed most of the second volume shortly before his death leaving only bits and pieces of chapters leaving only volume I whole.<br />A story of a swindler and a social satire on life in early 19th century Russia, Dead Souls is also a comment on class and hypocricsy. Small town Russian officials and landowners strive to keep up appearances, valuing them more importantly than susbtance. Even Chichikov knows this, in fact as the main character (anti-hero) he thrives on this.<br />Gogol's story is comic on its surface but reading it you get a glimpse of life just twenty years before Alexander II freeded the serfs from their landowners. Dead Souls is both comedy and satire.<br />One note the Peaver-Volokhonsky translation while newer is a bit \\"choppy\\" and the translators make the most awkward word selections from Russian to English. It makes reading this version a bit off-putting at times (The Guerney translation was the favorite of many Russian expat's). Dead Souls is worth the read.	2002-07-29

In this story of sin and redemption Dostoevsky weaves a great tale. It is a theological novel, a philisophical novel and possibly the finest psychological novel ever written. He studies his characters motives and intent, his philisophical values and how Raskalnikov justifies his actions which by any normal measure is a sinful one. Eventually even Raskalnikov realizes that he is not above other men, intelligence doesn't create a special dispensation for crimes. It's Raskalnikov's journey from guilt to redemption which make this a great study.<br />In some ways much of the angst of Raskalnikov can be understood better if the reader comes from a &quot;high church&quot; background such as (especially) Orthodox or Catholic. Much of the guilt and redemptives aspects of the story are framed in the theology of Dostoevsky's Russian Orthodoxy (easily recognizable to Catholics and Episcipalians).<br />Nineteenth century St Petersburg comes alive. Dostoevsky based his locations on actual streets and apartments; today you can still tour parts of St Pete's and find the actual apartments still in existence (and being lived in).<br />This is a deeply serious work and one not to be taken lightly. One of the few books that I can say may effect you life.	2002-07-29

But, there has always been a question about the numbers involved. Before the fall of the Soviet Union information was scarce and limited to secondhand accounts and what the Soviets would allow to be released. Harvest of Sorrow is based on this type of documentation.<br />Unfortunately there are many with a political motivation or whose understanding of history is limited to what they purchase in bookstores who tend to believe that any criticism of Conquest is \\"revisionism\\" of some sort. Absolutely false. (As an aside, my own background is US military. During the late 80's and early 90's I focused on the Warsaw Pact. I also speak Russian, work in a field that deals with the former Soviet Union and have visited there several times.)<br />Historians of the left AND the right have criticised the numbers in Harvest of Sorrow NOT because of ideological reasons but because the numbers don't add up with the data. Even conservative historians (Figes) have recently held that the numbers in Harvest are greatly exaggerated. Generally the old numbers agreed upon ranged from 3 to 13 million (interestingly anti-Stalinist marxist historians insist millions died).<br />Recent research since 1990 when archives of the Soviet government was opened shows the numbers to have probably been around 1 million, or several million less than Harvest of Sorrow contends. The archives consist of census data, requistions for supplies, personel, arrests, etc, etc.<br />That and the amount of intentional planning involved is what criticisms from historians to this book consist of, NOT whether the Soviets committed atrocities or used the famine for their ends. Increasingly the archival data shows that it was incompetance and the organizational stupidity of the party that aggravated the famine rather than any centrally directed program from Stalin.<br />Conquest uses second and third hand personal accounts to arrive at numbers (At the time that is all that was there to work with).  The data now shows that he has made serious errors.<br />Unfortunately many don't seem to understand this and any criticism or comments against this work are deemed as \\"left wing\\" or communist. Most of this comes from those with only a passing interest in objective history.<br />By all means read Harvest of Sorrow. There is much to commend it in terms of the stories of survivors. But be wary of the numbers and of the scholarship.

It's quite a rigoursly academic book, so much so that at times it's a bit stilted in that formal post-modern academic language popular among a certain generation of historians.<br />And that is unfortunate. Clark has done her homework well, her topic is an interesting one as is the theme she develops.<br />Unlike Volkov's &quot;St Petersburg a Cultural History&quot;, Clark show's the artists and writers on Nevsky Prospect were excited about the prospects of revolution under Bolshevism. And, for a few short years, avante garde plays, paintings, music and writing blossomed promoting the Bolshevik cause. But under growing hand of Stalinism it gradually became a tool to assist in his own particular vision of socialism in one country.<br />Clark doesn't let the artists off the hook. Unlike many cold war historians of the Conquest/Pipes variety, she shows a social group, complicite and active in varying degrees in the formation of the one party state. The same state that under Stalin destroyed them.<br />This is difficult reading at times- hampered by the PoMo academic writing style- and is deeply thought out (it probably requires more than a passing interest in Russian history.) Very important for students and layspersons interested in an overlooked area the Soviet era.	2002-07-19

While not definitive, it is nevertheless the best synthesis of the political and personal life of Lenin<br />One of the better reasons to read Service is that while he has no qualms about outlining the viciousness and brutality of Lenin and the Bolsheviks, he is also not a hard line ideologue. He is a historian and he takes history as he finds it. There is none of the strident cold-war dogmatism of Conquest or the russophobia of Pipes that often make their writings come uncomfortably close to political diatribes rather than analytical histories.<br />Service walks the fine line between personal and political biography fairly well. He also has the added bonus of being a good narrative historian which makes this an immensily readable book.<br />Lenin's early life is covered in good detail. What Service does well is to show how, after brother Alexander's excecution, the Ulyanovs were marginalized by the very class of society they had aspired to, and how this effected both Lenin and his sisters. Service goes on to show the interaction between Lenin and his female relatives and how this carried on throughout his life.<br />Being a total biography- personal and political- the political side gets a bit of a short shrift at times. Lenin as shown as the \\"bookish fanatic\\" and hypocondriact who is all revolution all the time with little time to spare in life for other diversions.<br />His single-mindedness is such that he dictates executions (never naming individuals just groups) to achieve his ends. What Service show best is how his temperament in childhood carried on to his political life- never brooking disagreement- throwing tantrums and denounciations- and rarely compromising.<br />And yet Lenin is at heart, a middle class bourgeois in his social manners. His personal relationships with women are not especially notorious save for a life-long relationship with Inessa Armand who may or may not have been his mistress.<br />Personal without being gossipy and showing Lenin's idiocincracies without being psychoanalytical, Service handles his biography well. All in all this is a highly readable, not perfect, but enjoyable biography of the life of one of the century's most notorious figures.ship with Inessa Armand who may or may not have been his mistress.<br />Personal without being gossipy and showing Lenin's idiocincracies without being psychoanalytical, Service handles his biography well.

By the time Children of the Arbat was ready for print Brezhnev had taken power and any dissent was supressed. Arbat was in fact, not printed until 1987.<br />The novel takes place in 30's Russia on the eve of the Great Purges under Stalin. The Arbat itself is street in Moscow which was once a bazaar and then (and now) the location of several cafe's and ourdoor music.<br />Children of the Arbat is great work combining literature and political commentary. Rybakov shows the impact of the terror on a small group of friends and relations. His portrayal of Stalin is on the mark, cold and ruthless.<br />An excellent novel of an era in Russia that should never be forgotten.	2002-07-15

I was given this book for my birthday by a friend and finally attempted to read this 700 page large trade paperback- largely so my friend would quit bugging me.<br />I'm very glad I relented and read &quot;House of Leaves&quot;.  Calling this a Horror novel is like calling &quot;Smokey and the Bandit&quot; a cop show.  Danielewski is far too literate a writer to be pigeon-holed in on genre.  This is more like reading modern day Poe meets Borges meets postmodern with literary influences from Melville to Pynchon.<br />A book- a collage really of narratives/commentaries/appendices- about the mysterious appearance and expansion of an inner hallway/world within a house in Virginia turns into an experiment in fear and reality.  There are several layers of narration, reference to intellectual works (some real, some only invented for the story).  Even the layout of the novel is part of the plot and style- not done in an overly clever manner- but instead helping to move the story along.<br />This is a literature in the same league as Powers, Franzen and DeLillo.  Highly recommended.	2002-07-10

The sign of a well-written and well-argued book is that it is one that challenges your world view by making you re-think and review your position.  It doesn't matter that it convinces you, it matters that it makes you sharpen your thought process.  The Age of Revolution does this well.<br />Hobsbawm's Age of Revolution (and his entire &quot;Age of...&quot; series) sees western history in marxian terms, a distinctly non-American approach.  I must admit that I have a special affinity for Age of Revolution.  I first read it in the early 80's as an undergraduate in history and while it didn't make me anywhere near a marxist it was the first to allow me to see history from a different angle than conventional/traditional histories.  I've been a reader of Hobsbawm ever since, disagreeing- often- with his analysis, but always respecting his perspective.<br />Age of Revolutions deals with the decisive era that began with the French Revolution and ends with the revolutions of 1848 (and includes of course the Industrial Revolution).  Hobsbawm writes as from a generalist perspective for the general reader of history (for non-historian's at least some background in Western European history is recommended before tackling this book).<br />A classic writing of European history.	2002-07-06

Moore survey's modern societies from England to Japan comparing social and economic structures with emphasis on class stratification.<br />Moore uses a hybrid Marxist analysis and turns it on its head by finding common conditions favorable to democracies and conditions that lead to fascist and commmunist dictatorships.  Moore finds some common factors to successful transition to include a need for social change to accompany technological change, the strength of a \\"middle class\\" and the need to address the concerns of agrarian society.<br />In the end Moore believes that the industrial change took place at great cost in every society.  The key to successful transistion to democracy was in how this \\"industrial revolution\\" was implemented.<br />Whether one agrees totally or not,  \\"Social Origins\\" never ceases to be stimulating in its analysis.	2002-07-06

A primer rather than an in depth artistic analysis, it's geared towards the general reader and it does a fine job at that.<br />Da Vinci's life is followed from his small town upbringing by a father who was a notary (in the European sense not the American) and hence held a status higher than the average peasant or townsman.<br />Serge Bramly attempts some psychoanalysis of Da Vinci and if there is a main weakness to the book in my opinion it is that. His explanation of art workshops in the Renaissance era is interesting and informative. To be commended is his description of Da Vinci's relationships with his workers, friends and family. But best of all is Bramly's explanation of the relationships between the nobility who financed his projects and Da Vinci.<br />An informative and enjoyable biography; Leonardo: The Artist and the Man is worth a read.	2002-07-06

And what a fantastic effort he gives.  In what may be the best general military history ever written he gives a panoramic sweep of the art of warfare through the centuries.  From Jone's coverage of Philip of Macedon's phalanxes to Moshe Doyan's IDF this is an impressive work.<br />Jones covers it in an excellent and clear writing style.  He shows that the development of warfare was both evolutionary and revolutionary.  Different weapons systems in the offense or defense give rise to counter systems and so on.  Weapons change but successful strategies, operations and tactics still maintain essential &quot;philosophies&quot;.<br />Encyclopedic in its breadth, The Art or War in the Western World is enjoyable reading for those with a serious interest in military history.	2002-07-06

In the Muslim Discovery of Europe he looks at how the Islamic world came to see the West and its influence.<br />Throughout Lewis shows the strange duality of the Islamic regimes and culture.  In some ways tolerant of Christianity and Judaism (although more dismissive and contemptuous than is commonly realized), Islamic culture became incapable of making the next leap forward into a more secular, rationale society.<br />Here Lewis traces the perception of writers, scientists, diplomats and traders from the Ottoman empire through their letters, edicts and other writings.  It is an amazing eye opener for those unfamiliar with non-western perceptions.  Lewis shows a culture that is first progressive, then increasingly unable to come to grips with either the West or its science and technology.  What was progressive becomes eventually, under the latter Ottomans, the definition of decay and backwardness.<br />This is great historical writing in some ways as important, though not as revisionist, as Eric Wolfe's \\"Europe and the Peoples Without a History\\".  Highly illuminating and highly recommended.	2002-07-05

In this, his first book, he weaves the stories of three farmers on the eve of WWI with the lives of contemporary characters.  The &quot;glue&quot; of the story is the photograph that is run across at a Detroit exhibit showing the three farmers in 1914.  It's a well written and thoughtful piece on obsession, change and the 20th century.  Better in some ways, than even his more highly praised later books.<br />Powers does a masterful job of integrating several characters into his storyline and integrating several discourses throughout.  Especially interesting is his discourse on the work of photographer August Sander.  I frankly had never heard of him and now find myself looking for pieces of his work in libraries and online.  It's always a good sign when a piece of writing whether fiction or non-fiction spurs interests into directions you'd never have gone into.<br />There is a connection with the characters that I get when I read Powers that I don't get with DeLillo, Franzen or other &quot;PoMo&quot; writers.  That's not a criticism of them but rather a praising of Powers writing.	2002-07-05

The difference that here he uses the novel as his means of expression.<br />This is a quality piece of Orwellian writing. Which means that it is excellent. His themes are the decay of the British both empire and colonists and the difference between not just knowing right versus wrong but also acting on it.<br />Orwell's descriptions of British colonists and their insular world and that contrast between the poverty and anger of the colonized is well done. He doesn't treat the Burmese as noble nor as crafty second class citizens. The great struggle here is within Flory. A man who represents the colonizers and comes to realize they are no better and no worse than the colonized.<br />As always Orwell is one of the greatest at locating and describing human behavior and culture. He is one of the great writers of the twentieth century.	2002-07-05

Jonathan Spence, a Yale professor of history,  has written extensively on Chinese history and his insights into the culture and people are invaluable.<br />Overall the reader is presented with a picture of the nature of change in Chinese civilization and how those changes are sometimes culture specific.  Chinese intellectual, political and social organizations are presented.  Importantly Spence shows the difficulty in incorporating Western concepts both technological and philisophical into Chinese society and the sometime rejection of these concepts for political and cultural reasons.<br />Spence's scholarship is second to none and this is a very readable history, both enjoyable and informative.  No better praise can be given than besides a college text on Chinese history &quot;The Search For Modern China&quot; is just as well suited as an informative and entertaining read for the layperson.  The integration of scholarship and writing makes this a good standard to judge other general histories.	2002-06-29

What is often overlooked is the fact that throughout it's existence it had the support of a large percentage of the population.  This is often a bit shocking to Americans like myself who've spent time in Russia (even today many of the older generation still praise Krushchev for providing housing and dachas to the general populace).<br />In \\"A History of Twentieth Century Russia\\" Robert Service brings a well written general history that in many ways addresses this.  Service identifies the origins of the great terror in the Bolshevik regimes early years and the ascension of Stalin to power.  He also identifies many of the educational, medical and other services much of the population recieved.  This doesn't mean that Service ignores the genocide that occurred under the Bolsheviks.  Not at all.  Service, as a historian, merely attempts a general history- the good, the bad and the ugly.  Service correctly attempts to show why some elements of the population where willing to put up with certain measures beyond just the terror they were exposed to.<br />This is a good general history, more balanced and lacking the political bent that many American scholars often approach modern Russian history with.  Service shows the brutality of the regime up front and as well as the constuctive changes that took place.  And, as Service shows, these changes came at a very high price.<br />Very readable and highly recommended.	2002-06-29

Helped by science, humans have begun to evolve into different if not species then at least sub-species.  And, this science rushed sub-evolution is propelled by culture not nature.<br />This is somewhat &quot;Big&quot; sci-fi with an archealogical bent pointing towards a mystery whose solution will influence mankind's future.  In this way it shares a common theme with Engines of God by McDevitt, although Rev Space relies less on archealogy as substance in the plot.<br />All in all it's a fine sci-fi tale whose ending is a bit disappointing.  No matter, with some strong characters (especially the two female protaganists) and nice attention to details, I enjoyed the read.	2002-06-27

Islamic fundamentalism is to be sure an even more radical and dangerous idea. Anderson, while concluding that fundamentalism is based upon fear and irrationality, nonetheless approaches the history of these movements in a balanced and well thought out manner.<br />Ms Anderson does a stellar job of getting at the historical basis for fundamentalism, explaining the theological arguments and putting them within the historical context of their time. This can be read solely as a history rather than as a religion/theological tract.<br />I can highly recommend this work by Karen Anderson, the first I've ever read by her.	2002-06-18

First the investment in the system of highways helped spur the demand for cars within American families.  Every family could now move around at an accelerated pace.  Secondly the system of loans for family homes helped encourage the creation of suburbs ringing once prosperous and lively cities.<br />Both disasters such as Syracuse, NY and successes like Portland, OR are described.  Kunslter's example of Paris with its broad boulevards and open cafes gives a great contrast with the San Diego freeway and downtown office culture in the US.<br />Intelligently written and often opinionated, its book to be recommended and one that's had a fair amount of influence since its publication.	2002-06-18

Out of the fractured and humiliated China of the 20's in spite of the \\"universal\\" appeal of marxism, Chinese communists retained a strong nationalistic bent throughout.<br />Especially good is the period covering the war with Japan.  The KMD of Chiang Kei Shek is given little leeway by Harrison.  Chiang was corrupt and so was the KMD.  When the KMD could have rallied Chinese- it failed to leaving the CCP to recruit among the population.  When the KMD might have fought the Japanese, it spent it's time with warlord struggles or against the CCP.<br />Harrison doesn't relent and shows the interparty rivalries and sometime viciousness of CCP politics.

In many ways it is everthing I enjoy about science fiction.  This is an archaleogically based story set on another planet in humanity's future.<br />McDevitt writes a good story.  His characterizations are well done and interesting even though a bit drawn out at times.  Endlessly fascinating was a galaxy that contained only one other known sentient species and the ruins of other &quot;mysterious&quot; now-extinct ones.  The discovery of the actual mystery of their extinction/demise was less interesting than the search the reasons behind it.<br />The description of space travel and the time lag between outposts and rescue as well as inter-organizational rivalries are really well done.  Technology and science may advance, but human nature will probably stay the same and McDevitt recognizes that as his headlines from the &quot;contemporary&quot; news services show.  I may give McDevitt's other novels a try after this.	2002-06-15

Reed does a good job in describing the world/ship that some of humanity has acquired and now pilots.<br />The strongest point in the story was the mystery of the builders.  Reed did very well in his description of some of the alien life forms that inhabited his universe.  Although it's always difficult to adequately describe the enormity of any object he succeeded in doing so to a large degree here.<br />I agree with one reviewer who stated the story is a bit rushed (especially near the end) and I got a bit tired of the endless &quot;rebirths&quot; that occurred.  Possibly the most difficult aspect of Marrow to really buy was the fact that races would want to ride along as passengers.  I could never really figure out why, since, a vacation spot the ship certainly wasn't.<br />All in all Reed does an above average job in Marrow.  A talented Sci Fi writer, I hope that he takes more time in his next book to develop his ideas and storylines.  Marrow is science fiction done well.	2002-06-11

Yes, many.  There is the typical difficulty all science fiction writers have dealing with interpersonal issues- romance, motivation etc.  They often don't really ring true (though any literary genre can be guilty of this it's especially true in science fiction) and here the characters themselves seem at times rather immature.<br />For example, a main character- pining for decades and hundreds of pages over \\"T\\"- realizes he will never have her and is told to pay attention to \\"Q\\".  Next scene with \\"E\\" is, he and \\"Q\\" AND child.  Huh?  That is the kind of shallow writing dealing with interpersonal issues that often gets science fiction in trouble.<br />The Qeng Ho are the traders of space, yet Vinge's description of economics and business operations is extremly rudimentary which contrasts poorly with his well done descriptions of technology and societies.  Vinge would do well to steep the Qeng Ho (or himself) in some sort of tangible economic theory.  I never really believed they were very viable as an economic force.  The best model for Qeng Ho economics would be the Dutch trading empire of the 17th century.<br />Why four stars then?  Because, Vinge's world is so detailed, his description of the three societies of spiders, Emergents, and Qweng so well thought out that it overcomes the faults of the story.  He keeps the reader guessing as to what the direction of the story will be and his scientific explainations are detailed and entertaining.<br />Vinge's storytelling overcomes the story weaknesses and makes for an entertaining read.  He is a good writer and at the end you're left wondering what other adventures will take place in his universe.	2002-05-08

For revisionist historians it's the former that is the great legacy while for those of the old school it is the latter that is the primary message.<br />Schama's \\"Citizens\\" is above all a great narrative history well documented and thought out.  Like most who lean toward the revisionist side he is somewhat sympathetic to the regime and the nobility.  That information should certainly aid the reader while navigating this well written work.<br />You can't help but admire the combination of writing and research that marks this great book.  One note, Schama's area of expertise was not originally the French Revolution but rather the Dutch trading empire and it's aftermath.  The strengths of Citizens is non stop chronicle of the actions and interactions of the key members of the revolution's story, from Louis the XVI's incompetence to Robspierre's chilling demeaner.<br />This is an almost epic narrative of the age.  It unfortunately, but because of its size, understandably ends far too soon for a complete grasp of the whole era and its aftermath.  Definately recommended for students and casual readers of history.	2002-05-02

Geoffrey Brum's volume on the Napoleonic era is excellent and highly recommended.<br />Most of the series is easily found in used book stores in both paperback and hardcover.

Both as an officer and later a government official Vann was actively engaged and dedicated to the Amercican cause.  The contrast between a superpowers strategy and the story of one man's involvement is wonderfully done.  Biography, diplomatic history and war intertwine.  The story documents the leadership's willingness to believe what they wanted to hear, Vann's attempts to illuminate the realities in the field to them and his struggle to implement what he considered the correct actions.<br />Sheehan is an excellent writer and weaves a narrative that is informative, exciting and sometimes opinionated.  His bio of John Paul Vann serves as the vehicle to expose the hopes and failures of the American involvement.<br />An excellent telling of an American tragedy, well deserving of the Pulitzer.  Highly recommended.	2002-04-26

He not only does a fine job in outlining the history of Rome's transition from Republic to Empire but he also highlights the price of that empire.  The inability of the Romans to adjust to the changes that hegemony brought about contained the seeds of its own destruction.<br />Hoopers narrative is clear and concise and is easily understood by students or laymen.  As is pointed out in an excellent review below it is a bit outdated in some areas but its analysis is so well done that few books published on the empire today can match this wonderful book.  The reflection on the causes of the fall of Rome are worth the price of the book itself.<br />Reading Hooper brings to light that fact that much of Roman history is a foreshadowing of the realities empires in every era face.	2002-04-24

I'm happy to be a new reader of his.  Powers' is capable of a very fine, clear writing style.  He also, as I've come to learn, often intertwines two or more stories into his narratives.<br />Galatea is also somewhat of an autobiography, where the author refers to the real goings on in his personal history including his real name as that of the main character.  One fault I had witht he novel was I found it a bit difficult to reconcile the two main story lines and think they didn't really mesh well into each other.  One thing that puts Powers ahead of many of the other pomo writers (Delillo, Gaddis and later Wallace) is his ability to make the reader connect with the characters personal feelings, occurences and beliefs on a deeper level.  I'd also go so far as to state that he is easily the most accessible.<br />I found Galatea to be a very readable and well written novel that has led me to more of Powers' writings.

I've read several dozen works on the Soviet era between the October revolution and the Second World War, from Pipes to Conquest and including Solzeynitsin's \\"Gulag\\" trilogy. While Solzeynitsin focused on the impact of those who were swept up in the great terror of the '30s, \\"Everyday Stalinism\\" looks at the impact on the average individual's daily life in the cities of the USSR.<br />Unlike the Pipes/Conquest terror-as-a-psychopathic-spasm-and-if-you-don't-believe-that-you're-a-revisionist school, Fitzpatrick is more focused on Stalinism at the common level.  How it was maintained and what its effects were.<br />And, surprisingly, many people supported or benefited from it by filling the spaces of those \\"liquidated\\" or informing and denouncing rivals in love or work. The real fear wasn't always the KGB at 4am but a neighbor or acquaintance at work. The sad truth is that many were co-opted by the system and worked within it to support the party.<br />Addressed is the commonly held belief then that no matter what you may have done since the revolution, if you had been born into an \\"enemy class\\" then you were in a sense marked for life.  The commoness of this view is highlighted in Fitzpatricks account. the irony of this is that those who rose up to replace the liquidated were themselves given bourgeois rewards.<br />Fitzpatrick does excellent work in guiding the reader throught the beauracratic, social and economic difficulties of the average Soviet citizen. Well researched and well written this can be read as an introduction to the era or especially as a valuable look at Stalinism from the perspective of the urban \\"masses\\".<br />Fitzpatrick, unlike the Conquest/Pipes school, does better at  facing the sad and bitter truth that the system- while terryifing for some- was held together and supported by many who benefited. Even today walking the streets of St Petersburg, you will see many in the older generation holding pictures of Stalin in a sort of reverence.  The co-opting of the culture and population is, to me, the most troubling aspect and legacy of Stalinism. Everyday Stalinism could function as an interesting companion piece to Orwell's 1984.<br />Well done.co-opting of the culture and population is, to me, the most troubling aspect and legacy of Stalinism.

Robert Conquest has written the definitive account of the extremist ideaology and totalitarian egomania of Stalin.<br />I say this even though much of his data is extremely flawed.  Since we now have access to many of the archives of the Soviet period it's become apparent that the numbers may need to be lowered. Unfortunately Conquest has remained loyal to his numbers which are based soley on interviews, while many younger historians using quantative methods from numbers based on logistical data, prison records etc, have cast a different light on the terror.<br />Nevertheless, you cannot read about the terror without asking: How could this happen? How could a whole nation sheepishly comply with it's own destruction? No convincing answer is really given in \\"The Great Terror\\". Conquest only gives an accounting of the trials and arrests of countless individuals.<br />While most are innocent of charges (though many are not \\"innocents\\" themselves\\"), much of the fascination lies with how the terror machine eats its own. Those that arrest and torture one day become arrested and tortured the next. Stalin's paranoia knew no bounds. A slight a few years before would send one to Siberia. A disagreement between with Stalin in the '20s would result in liqiudation when he achieved power. Rivals and former rivals suffered. Hundreds of thousands with little or no connection would disappear for years or forever.<br />Sadly there are few tales of individual heroism to tell (for that turn to Solzynetsin's \\"Gulag\\" trilogy.) Those on the chopping block hold out hope, however false, that their compliance may hold salvation for their families, others, in great feats of denial, continue till the end to support the Communist party.<br />In spite of the off numbers, millions of lives were still destroyed and it remains chilling in its detail.  Anyone wanting to familiarize themselves with a horrible moment of Russian history and the dangers of totalitarianism must read \\"The Great Terror\\".to familiarize themselves with a horrible moment of Russian history and the dangers of totalitarianism must read \\"The Great Terror\\".	2002-04-22

But beneath it's a more complicated mesh of greed, xenophobia, and a rash of other human shortcomings.  Franzen weaves a good tale.  His writing ability shows through when he is able to change perspective and scene in the next paragraph.  The trick of a good writer I think is to do this without being too clever and confusing the reader (unless that's the writer's aim).  Franzen does this well and even intentionally misleads the reader.<br />He characterizations are well done, although some of the supporting roles are a bit one dimensional (the greedy businessman, the xenopobe etc).<br />The only major criticism I have is the premise of the main protagonist's &quot;Jammu's&quot; actions.  I didn't think there was enought to justify her actions- i.e. the stakes weren't worth the plan of action she developed.<br />I recommend &quot;The Twenty-Seventh City&quot;.

A liberal leftist in the old sense of the words, his dedication to political liberty compelled him to put his life on the line for the ideals he held dear.<br />And a harrowing experience it was.  Orwell shows how the forces of the Republic were themselves split along idealogical lines and eventually became totalitarian as the war progressed.  The atrocities on both sides, the deeply felt values of his anarchists and the political intrigues of an increasingly crumbling republic are all highlighted.<br />Read Orwell.  Read this, his essays and his novels, not just the popular 1984 or Animal Farm.  His one one of the great voices of the early-mid twentieth century.

The large scale view of history (meta-history on a Toynbee scale) has been somewhat abandoned by historians in the last two generations.  The few schools that have adopted such approaches, such as World-Systems, seem to have an academic and political axe to grind winding up as intellectual cul-de-sacs rather than pathbreaking theories.<br />History in the large sense seems to have been increasingly taken over by evolutionary biologists and anthropologists instead of historians.  Why is not obvious.  Possibly the insular academic world of historians isn't open to inter-disciplinary approaches.  Whatever the reason, historians who want to develop a history of the world in the big picture need to access the quickly developing theories and discoveries in other disciplines.<br />Wright joins a few others in taking this inter-disciplinary approach to get a sense of order in the direction our past has taken us.  Wright uses systems of game theory to explain human behaviors on a large scale although he tends to discount some specific historical periods and civilizations (I wasn't exactly pleased at his thoughts on Roman civilizations.)  He mines the rich amount of studies and writings on evolutionary biology, sociology and anthropology in his analysis of human political evolution.<br />In the end Wright succeeds in a fairly coherent and approachable theory of humanity's development.  Others authors have taken Wright's interdisciplinary approach and can be recommended.  These include Jared Diamond's \\"Guns, Germs and Steel\\" and  Luigi Luca Cavalli-Sforza's \\"Genes, Peoples and Languages\\".<br />This should be a call to historians interested in \\"Meta-history\\" to bridge the chasm between the social and hard sciences.	2002-03-26

By contrast he was a strong patriot of his native Florence, a city-state surrounded by larger, more powerful political entities and forced to participate in various alliances and rivalry's in order to insure it's own political survival.<br />Known more for \\"The Prince\\" (His other writings such as \\"Discourses on Livy\\" and \\"The Art of War\\" are not as well known) than anything else, Machiavelli was also a great supporter of Florence's republican form of government.  He understood that a nation needed it's own citizen army rather than depend on foreign mercenaries or powers for its protection.<br />This biography written by Maurizion Viroli takes us on a more personal journey through Machiavelli's life.  We're exposed to his personal friendships and relationships which show him as a much more sympathetic and ultimately likeable individual.<br />Understanding his position after his fall from office, one can see why he wrote \\"The Prince\\" for Lorenzo Medici.  A well written and well translated biography, this is a good starter for anyone interested in the life an background of Machiavelli as well as a decent primer for the political scene of the beginnings of the Italian Wars of the sixteenth century, an event whose occurence is only now being realized as the real beginning of early modern europe.	2002-03-22

The atrocious (and unsettling) lack of knowledge in history is apparent in the reviews:  witness for instance how few readers have made the connection to Toynbees \\"A Study of History\\" a flawed, but much superior precursor.  This is the sort of tome that appeals to the not-quite-grounded in reality Pat Buchanon crowd.<br />The amazing (and dangerous) part is that some feel this validates 9-11. A very illogical, not-well-thought-out and unsophisticated approach. To digress a bit, 9-11 was rather the lashing out of an out-group trying to come to grips with its increasing marginalization as a non-democratic/non-free market society (Middle-East Islamic society that is) and with its poverty than any \\"Clash\\" theory coming to fruitation. Yes, there are problems with the Islamic world, but those problems are rooted in the LACK of political and economic reforms.<br />Don't mistake the failure of intelligence agencies in not eliminating or discovering a terrorist plot with a validation of a poorly written book's theory of civilizations.<br />Huntington shows little understanding of the power of globalization in drawing a large part of the world together. Instead he throws in historical examples, many of them completely out of context, to support his thesis, rarely attempting to analyze the alternative (and usually correct) explainations.<br />His historical analogies are often only casually and poorly made.  For example when speaking of Pakistan, China and India and their political interrelationships he makes almost no reference to the wars fought between these \\"civilizations\\" in just the later part of the twentieth century!  An unexcused oversight for someone so many have given four and five stars to in their reviews.  And these sorts of incongruities abound in \\"Clash of Civilizations\\".<br />Sustained and critical analysis shows how little Huntington's thesis holds up. Most of Asia, Latin America and Eastern Europe are tied with the West, both economically and culturally. Countries in the world that have adopted democratic governments have nearly doubled.<br />Even a cursory look shows that his analysis can be made to be somewhat relevant in regards to only one of the civilizations- Islam.  (And there any deeper probing into the events of the last two decades reveals little relevance from Huntington.)  It seems only rational that if only one of the eight-part foundations of a theory can even begin to be approached as tenable then maybe the theory isn't correct.  Yet many seem to be oblivious to this sort of logic.<br />Institutions such as the WTO have linked our financial fortunes with each other. Globalization has located firm's headquarters in New York, engineering in Denver, software development in India and production in Malaysia. The Western concept of human rights and dignity has begun to take hold in many non-western socities. And so on, and so on...<br />Huntington- tragically- seems to believe that democratic ideals are limited to Western societies. It's a narrow and certainly ethnocentric view, deserving perhaps of being held by a 19th century mind, but embarrassing when held by a contemporary Harvard professor.<br />Huntington's analysis is at the level of a fourth year student at a second rank university who's read far too much Spengler and takes Toynbee to a whole different level. This is not an \\"exploration\\" but seems an exploitation by someone who should have known better and whose best days are evidently behind him.<br />I strongly encourage and advise anyone to pick up Francis Fukuyama's \\"The End of History and the Last Man\\". While not perfect, this intelligent, well written and highly misunderstood work puts it's faith in democracy as the \\"ideal\\" for all individuals and societies.<br />In the end it's Fukuyama who is correct in saying that 9-11, for example, is not the portent of a \\"clash\\" but a rear-guard action of those who come from nations where the lack of democracy open societies has enslaved them in the only other world view they have. Even if you disagree with Fukuyama, you can't help but notice that his thesis operates on a much higher level than Huntington's simplistic and incorrect approach.r example, is not the portent of a \\"clash\\" but a rear-guard action of those who come from nations where the lack of democracy open societies has enslaved them in the only other world view they have.

To call this book a hammerblow is to fall for a weak, almost emotional rather than academic analysis. While Blaut makes some excellent arguments about Europe's lack of credit to other cultures, especially during it's early expansion, in the end the facts don't stand up to his argument.<br />He overlooks that overwhelming riches did little to stop Spain's rapid decline as a power (it may have even accelerated it to some extent). Blaut seems to have discounted the fall of Constantinople and the subsequent fleeing of teachers and artists to the West as a factor.<br />What subsequent events does Blaut either overlook or underevaluate? For starters there are the beginnings of the scientific method in the West. Then there are things that muck up his argument like the advancement of western medicine (so much that even the Chinese would ask for western doctors in the 16th century, military improvements and numerous advancements in technology.<br />And so on and so on. I'm all for the remembering of contributions and influences from non-european societies, civilizations and cultures, but this \\"mea culpa\\" Western guilt has reached a bit of a height in Blaut's work.

Early on the main character- Severian- actually takes part in the horrible and brutal torture of the woman he loves.  Well, at least one of the women he &quot;loves&quot;, seems Severian falls in love at the drop of a hat.  Redemption here, doesn't even build up.  He just announces that he won't torture/kill again after letting a &quot;client&quot; go.  The redemption itself is a response to the terrible critical beating Wolfe took over the ammorality of Severian by several literary reviewers of that time (early eighties), not to any pre-planned story line.<br />The characters are basically one dimensional, with little thought to any depth except maybe only slightly Severian, who is not that likeable for that matter.  At the end of book II before he meets the &quot;rebel&quot; commander, he needlessly kills the three guards who work for the man he supposedly admires.

Judged against other science fantasies it is among the best, but judged against classics it doesn't really stand up.  I only add this because of the number of reviews comparing this to great writing of the past.  Not so.<br />Wolfe's plotting leaves a lot to be desired.  It one thing to subtley leave clues and nuances but another thing to not tie up plot lines.  Ian Bain's &quot;Use of Weapons&quot; is a good model.  Reading it one has the feeling of &quot;where is this going?&quot;, but by the final chapter Bain converges the total writing towards his goal.  There isn't quite this cohesion in any of the New Sun books.  Using archaic vocabulary is at first interesting, then becomes nothing but a gimmick that basically makes the reading a chore rather than a pleasure.  Some reviewers have commented that Wolfe writing is on such a high plain that he makes the reader work and as such he is great literature.  Baloney.  Read Dosteyevski, Hemmingway, Tolstoy and Shakespeare.  There isn't much guessing when it comes to plot, rather the point is to convey a sense or impression rather than make the reader guess as to what the hell is going on.  Again, I only make the comparasion to these writers because of the numbers of reviewers comparing this to &quot;great literature&quot;.<br />As a science fantasy, this is a decent work.  Like most, it's basically an adolescent male fantasy, complete with emotional, submissive women, the requisite battles with strange attackers and a citadel that is really something else than what it seems.  Additionally, the endless &quot;I loved her&quot; statements regarding every other women he meets are damned irritating.<br />The characters are basically one dimensional, with little thought to any depth except the main character, who is not that likeable for that matter.  When at the end of book II he meets the &quot;rebel&quot; commander he needlessly kills the three guards whowork for the man he supposedly admires.  Then, V, after seeing the headless body of one of his men, greets Severian as....a guest.  Not exactly a military leader that would inspire confidence among his soldiers.  I began to think that Urth would actually be a better place if the main character and all of his torturers guild were basically wiped off the planet and the series itself would be a much better one if the mystery of how Urth became the way it was became the main point of the story rather than a collateral one.  <br />Basically, if you like adolescent male science fantasies with a bit of a twist this does well.  Judged on that basis it stands well on its own merits.  <br />Judged as great literature, it falls very flat.  It takes more than a thesauras referencing medieval English vocabulary and sometimes convoluted plotting which some confuse as &quot;subtlety&quot; to qualify as classic literature.  Tolkein on some level knew this, and produced a much greater work.	2001-06-16

That raised my expectations to very high levels, which the book wasn't quite capable of measuring up to.  That being said it is a good story.<br />Wolfe's world is a unique and strange one and he does a good job at building an image of a strange future dystopia set in the far, far future.  I think his use of vocabulary that hasn't been seen on pages in decades helps visualize Urth's strangeness,   although he tends to overwrite at times.  He gives a very decent description of a decaying city and the strange society that inhabits it.  <br />The weaknesses?  On one hand the torturers' guild themselves aren't exactly sympathetic subjects.  The main character, Severian has a number of faults, the most annoying being his ability to fall in love with just about every woman he sees after about five minutes with them.  And those woman?  They are very one dimensional characters- Madonna/Whore types.  Woman and love are one area most fantasy/sci-fi writers need to stay away from.  Either that or they need to expand their personal lives a bit.<br />Be that as it may, it IS a good read.  I'll certainly read the sequel if for no other reason than to see more of Wolfe's description of his world of Urth, it's background and to see if his character development has improved.  I've not read anything else he's written, but he certainly has the tools to be a very good writer in the genre.	2001-06-14

Written in 1962, this Harper Perennial has stood the test of time.  Almost forty years later it's still one of the best beginners guides around.  It gives you a beginning vocabulary of 4000 of the most used Russian words, a  decent overview of all the grammar rules and readings based on the previous  lessons.<br />The authors give good, matter of fact advice on grammar rules  and word memorization.  More than any other comparable guide, it delves  into vocabulary, grammar, and reading assignments.  Although it's a  &quot;beginners guide&quot;, beginners will need some Russian language  tapes to get a real feel for the language.  That said, I'd especially  recommend Russian for Beginners for those in need of a refresher (like  myself).<br />The only down side is the format of the book.  There are only  two chapter headings, and the forty-two lessons seem to run on into each  other, making it difficult to find anything easily by just flipping back  through the pages.  Be that as it may, I highly recommend this book,  especially if you once had some knowledge of Russian and are looking for a  comprehensive refresher.  I give it five stars because it is the best of  the half dozen books on the subject I've seen.	2000-03-03
