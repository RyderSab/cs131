Franken, who seems to get genuinely angry by what he sees in the media and from the White House, deftly avoids shrill and strident attacks of the right (of which, unfortunately, Michael Moore's Stupid White Men was often guilty). Instead he cuts them down by combining some sophomoric insults (and I mean that in good way) with decently researched facts, courtesy of a team of Harvard students. I say 'decently' researched because several large sections almost seemed to be taken directly from Eric Alterman's What Liberal Media? In fact, in the acknowledgements, he thanks Alterman for writing a book that he basically just added jokes to. <br />The beginning of the book is dedicated to debunking the likes of Ann Coulter, Bill O'Reilly, and Sean Hannity. Shooting fish in the barrel of course, and hardly worthy of any serious debate, but definitely good grist for the humor mill. He moves on to anything and everything having to do with the right, inlcuding of course, George Bush, the war in Iraq (which he initially supported), environmental policy, tax cuts, and one of the better chapters: &quot;I Meet Barbara Bush and it Doesn't Go Well.&quot; Good fun for liberals and democrats, with just enough journalistic rigor.	2003-09-17

It is brilliant, and it's probably one I'll hold other books about race and/or identity up to.

Alternating between teen romance and startling brutality, this debut book speaks to us about rampant consumerism, mass self-medication, mother-daughter relationships, and how we view adolescence. <br />Wildly bold and imaginative, Just Like Beauty will grab you from page two and surprise you with how much you get pulled into Edie interior world.  Yes, there's mutant grasshoppers and suicide cults and such, but despite all this, there's still nothing more perilous than growing up.	2003-02-05

It's also mandatory reading for anyone interested in uptopian/dystopian sub-genre.  It was the inspiration for 1984 and despite the fact that the early chapters feel very similar to Orwell's book, the story diverge into very different an distinct stories.<br />Zamyatin never lets the politics of the book override his story.

Upon completing this you can honestly claim to know more about the giant squid than your friends.  There is something of a problem with the book in that, so little is known about Archeteuthis, it's tough to fill a book with something more than marine biology.  This is evident in the &quot;naming of the squid&quot; chapter and the exceedingly dull chapter on giant squid models.<br />However, the subject matter and transparent excitement of the author win out.  You know Ellis admires this beast, he shows it, but it does not detract from the science.  Very worthwhile.	2002-09-25

I love the idea of this story -- a sudden transition from the stone age to bronze age for a small community.  Crace clearly has a great love for the art of storytelling and elevates his protagonist/storyteller to respected position in this community of laborers.  His descriptive accounting of the &quot;Father's&quot; wanderings to the heath and back (and what he brings with him) are beautifully told.

Actually, it's a history, not a textbook, explaining the origins of each part of the equation (Faraday &amp; Davy's rivalry in the &quot;e&quot; chapter, Lavoisier experiments and eventual demise in the &quot;m&quot; chapter, etc). Before reading this, those names would ring a bell but I couldn't tell you one thing about those men or what motivated them to pursue the experiments they did. This, of course, is all a precursor to Einstein's work, and the atomic and other uses of the equation. <br />It's spoonfed, but it's the only way I will ever keep this stuff down.	2002-02-12

Chabon will take you on an unforgetable adventure to cherish.  The plot is so well crafted, and the characters rich, realistic, and yet somehow 'superheroic.'<br />As a long time comic fan, I especially appreciate his attention to trade.  He clearly did his homework.  But that's clearly not what this book is about.  There is really so much here to look at and love.  You've got the Kavalier &amp; Clay duo (emulating the great comic book pairings like Schuster &amp; Siegel and Kirby &amp; Lee) representing the impulse motivated/action oriented hero vs. the mild-mannered, reserved alter ego.  You've got a remarkable portrait of American life from the 30's to the 50's and the cultivation of escapism in the American culture.  And not least of all, you've characters who absolutely enthrall you and break your heart.	2001-10-23

It lacked the cohesiveness of message found in Parliament of Whores.  Certain chapters were delightful (the wine tasting chapter, most notably), but others were simply grating.  One fully expects a humorous lambasting of liberals in PJ's books, but his attack on Hillary Clinton was unusually mean-spirit and entirely devoid of humor.

If only high school texts had Tuchman's easy-going fluency I would have retained a lot more History.<br />Much of this book, of course, focuses on the war impact on The Dutch and The French.  To that end, it truly presents the Revolution as the first world war. Much of her discussion is of the ineptitude of the British leadership at the time.  There are excellent profiles, particularly of Sir Rodney.	2001-07-10

Editor Lethem has broadly defined 'amnesia' define anything related to the doubt of one's mental state or existence.  That's wide net, and the resulting catch is eclectic and disjointed.<br />I also have a problem with the excerpts from full novels.  Although many stand well on their own, I always feel as if I'm not getting the full point.  Once I was halfway through I began skipping the excerpts and focused on the complete short stories.<br />But as I said, there are many gems here.

What is the appropriate level violence to apply to one's enemies?  Is OK to manipulate your own soldiers for the good of the people? The SF plot of the novel allows Card to use the canvass of an intergalactic ware to tell his tale.<br />Beyond that, Ender makes for a fascinating character.  The boy genius is a tortured, sympathetic hero like no other.

At the surface, it's war story, and a good one.  Beyond that, it's a character study, and this is where it's genius.  The recon patrol is, of course, an assortment of young American men.  The group is varied, without being cliched (there aren't the typical roles, i.e. the joker, the smart guy, etc).  Mailer expertly peels there past  to illustrate the causes of their current behaviors and reactions, in a first person, dream-like style.<br />At a deeper level, Mailer is conducting a ideological level, represented by the conflict between Cummings and Hearn -- whether it's liberalism vs. conservatism or totalitarianism vs. freedom, hasn't sunk in with me yet.  However, I'm looking forward to re-reading some of their exchanges so I can have another look at Mailer's point.	2001-02-21

The dialogue is typically awkward and many characters are wooden.  The breakthrough moment for the plot is extraordinarily farfetched and the resolution seems harried.<br />That said, the story moves along crisply and the terrorist atrocities it presents are unnerving, to say the least.

This is merely a showcase for characters, and unfortunately, only two of them are interesting (Conrad and Peepgrass).  Croker, the main character, gives a glimpse of deep south money, but he proves to be repetitious and simple.  The Mayor and Roger-Too-White characters are completely without depth and do not ring true.  <br />It does have some delightful segments of course, (the 'workout session' and Conrad's prison stay) which redeem the book somewhat.  Otherwise, I would only recommend this to die-hard Tom Wolfe fans.	2000-11-17

It should be known that this book is more appealing to those with at least a moderate interest in contemporary American history.

The writers leave no item from the past 100 years untouched -- it's remarkably broad and thorough.<br />After 40-50 years, the actual columns under the precious headlines (which are really the point of the book) get a bit formulaic, and I found my self skimming some of them.

It is truly a benchmark for war-story  development, technical details and action.

I've read all of Clancy's non-fiction (not counting the ghost-written pulp he puts his name on) and they have steadily declined since the Sum of All Fears.  His right wing paranoia has overtaken his  ability to write a plausible plot.
