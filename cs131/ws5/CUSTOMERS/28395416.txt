What brought me to this book was the opposing negative reviews and positive reviews and witch war excitement generated by this author.  So I bought it.  Damn good non-fluffy bunny pagan book telling a true (I think) story of initiation.  I've never read a better one.<br />I really think that the author is hiring people to write the positive AND Negative reviews since it has generated a great deal of interest here in the U.S.  The bookstores here in New Orleans can't keep it in stock.  As soon as the local Pagans heard there was a controversy surrounding The Quest  they ran to the book stores to buy one.  They initially bought all of them.<br />Good for them, thats why I bought mine.  Damn glad I did.  GREAT BOOK!  I am American I love America and I love this book.  I can't say as much for those Welsh people who aren't so nice so I really don't care much for them, but I really like the description of Wales.  I think Wales is neat and I think Welsh stories are neat, but I hope the Welsh reviewers are not anything like the Welsh people that I will meet when I go there.  yes, I am going to visit Wales and Caer Idris and the Fairy Ring and Mt. Snowdonia.  Yaaaaaaa.<br />Thank you Rhuddlwm whoever you are.	2003-11-09

But what kept me reading was an excellent description of The Welsh Witchcraft tradition.  I do love a mystery.  I have been interested in Welsh Witchcraft for years after reading one by simmonds.  This book gives a true rendition of the practices, which can be confirmed by reading any good Welsh book on Mythology or pre roman history and archeology.<br />This book is a good non-sensational book telling a true story of witchcraft initiation.

Once in 1985 and twice over the last month.  Those critics who have given it poor reviews obviously haven't read the Way.  It does not contain theosophical teachings.  I know.  I'm a theosophist.  These critics must have read something else. They also dislike the author.  It is obviously a personal thing and has nothing to do with the value of the Book. I have a degree in Welsh History and a long association with the Welsh Folklore Society. Besides actually visiting Betws-y-coed and tracing the authors life, I have interviewed several members of Y Tylwyth Teg in Florida and two members of The Dynion Mwyn &quot;mother grove&quot; in Wales. Very interesting people. I may debate whether the family which taught the authors, was totally correct in their philosophy, but I can say they were honest and sincere. I found nothing inconsistent with the ideas and words in the Way. In fact, I was hard pressed to contradict anything they purported to believe. Those who are criticising the book are listening to rumour instead of reading the book. I wonder why they don't want you to read it? If in fact it contains some ideas and words allegedly taken from other sources, so what. I have read over sixty books on Witchcraft in the last 17 years which are like reading a carbon copy of each other. But, I also have read the Way. From whatever source these Co-authors obtained their material, it is fresh and absolutely wonderful. No, the critics didn't bother to read the books. They just have a problem with people reading the truth. The author(s) must be doing something right. A very famous book store in California has already (according to them) sold over a thousand copies. Good for you Rhuddlwm. You've done good. Excellent Book on Welsh Witchcraft.
