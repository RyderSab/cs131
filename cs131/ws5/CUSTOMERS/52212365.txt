The purpose of this review is to say whether or not I feel you should buy this book. <br />The answer is Yes. <br /> <br />If you are already a CSI television series fan, you will love to read about your favorite characters. Collins does a great job putting their personalities in print. <br /> <br />If you have never seen a CSI television episode, the CSI books by Collins are great read-alones. You do not have to know anything about the television version to enjoy these books. They are fine cozy mysteries all by themselves. <br /> <br />I saw only one CSI episode on television before I purchased this book. I enjoyed the book so much that I instantly became a fan of the CSI television series. I became a CSI fan because Collins's book enabled me to discover the relationships of the characters in one sitting; I did not have to watch a year or two of the TV program to decipher the back-story of the characters. But, I am now trying to catch up on the television program stories by watching re-runs.  <br /> <br />Also, I enjoyed this first book so much, that I purchased and read four other Collins' CSI books in rapid succession.   <br /> <br />You do not need to read the CSI books in order, but I recommend you do so for your own enjoyment.  Also, if you read the books in order, you will be able to see how the characters develop over time. I look forward to more books as they become published.  <br /> <br />Yes, I recommend this CSI book to die-hard CSI fans and newcomers alike. <br />	2005-07-04

Instead, I'm writing this review to let you know whether or not the book is worth your hard-earned cash. In my opinion, Sick of Shadows is a worthy purchase.  <br /> <br />These are the reasons that I liked Sick of Shadows: <br />1) The prose is \\"light\\" and easy to read. Its simplicity is actually charming. <br />2) There are no explicit sex scenes. <br />3) I enjoy the banter among the characters. <br />4) I enjoy the TV-script-like plights and miscommunications (reminds you of the \\"trouble\\" that \\"Lucy\\" would get into). <br /> <br />Why I withheld one star. I do not like historically incorrect details specifically modern attitudes ascribed to Edwardian characters (in this case--the main characters semi-accepting homosexual proclivity as acceptable behavior which was not the case in Edwardian times).  <br /> <br />The books in this Edwardian mystery series by Marion Chesney are delightful to read. I read all three published to date and look forward to additional stories in the future.  <br /> <br />If you haven't read the first two books in this series, I recommend that you do so, in order for you to really get to know the characters, although Sick of Shadows is fine as a stand alone book. <br /> <br />Again, this review is to let you know about the book itself and its entertainment value to me. Thank you and hope you enjoy this book as well.	2005-05-03

Ryker is captain of his own ship. \\"Taking Wing\\" introduces the new crew. Caveat: The story line and action in this book were less than stellar. In fact, this book was a star gone nova-a major bore, but I anticipate subsequent books in this series to get better because they couldn't possibly get worse. While I offer some criticism, the list of characters that I provide below will help you. <br /> <br />The criticism: Too many characters were introduced in this book. New folks kept turning up until page 341. The only people I wanted to meet was the U.S.S. Titan's bridge crew, the chief medical officer, and chief engineer. But the reader was assaulted by literally dozens and dozens of names, ranks, and species of  the Federation crew, in addition to Klingon, Romulan, and Reman characters. Besides this, we met six additional Titan guests and six Romulan political factions with their leaders.  Any story that might have been told was swallowed up by these extraneous, mind-numbing, and unnecessary details. The alphabet soup of names and species made me space-sick by the time I got to the end of the book. While Riker's ship is the first Starfleet ship whose compliment of humans is in the minority, we did not need to meet nearly 40 of the crew in one book to get that point. What is left for the reader to \\"discover\\" aboard Titan in the future?  <br /> <br />In addition, the whole essence of  the book boiled down to promoting ethnic diversity and homosexuality. By 2005, like women's suffrage, these topics are over exposed and boring. Let's get back to story telling and space adventure. I want to read about strange new places and exciting interplanetary conflict. I do not want to read about who is lusting after whom. If I want to read about that, I can buy a Harlequin.  <br />  <br />For future reference, here is the list of Titan'screw: <br />CPT William T. Riker, Captain, human <br />CDR Christine Vale, First Officer <br />CDR Deanna Troi, Chief Counselor, Betazoid <br />Mr. Najem Jaza, senior science officer, Bajoran <br />LT CDR Nidani Ledrah, chief engineer, Tiburian <br />Dr. Shenti Yisec Eres Ree, chief medical officer, Pahkwa-thanh <br />LT CDR Ranul Keru, tactical officer/chief of security, Trill <br />LT Bowan Tadowski, human, transporter technician <br />LT Melora Pazlar, stellar cartography, Elaysian <br />Waen, Bolian <br />Savalek, Vulcan <br />Chief (Dr) Bralik, geologist, Ferengi <br />Alyssa Ogawa, nurse, human <br />Noah, Alyssa's son <br />Ensign Kenneth (Kent) Norellis, astrobiologist, human <br />Olivia Bolaji, pilot <br />Chief Axel Bolaji, flight controller, human <br />Huilan, counselor, S'ti'ach <br />Orilly Malar, exobiologist, Irriol <br />Torvig Bu-Kar-Nguv, engineer, Choblik <br />K'chak'! op \\"Chaka\\", computer specialist, Pak'shree <br />LT Sariel Rager, ops, <br />Cadet Zurin Dakal, operations/communications specialist, Cardassian <br />Ensign Aili Lavena, conn, Selkie <br />LT Eviku, xenobiologist, Arkenite <br />Dr Se'al Cethente Qas, scientist, Syrath <br />LT Rriarr, security guard, Caitian <br />LT Hutchinson, security guard <br />Ebriscentil, cook, Ktarian <br />Scot Bishop-Walker, bartender, human <br />LT CDR Fo Hachesa, gamma shift bridge officer, Kobliad <br />Engsign Ichi <br />LT T'Lirin, assault team, Vulcan <br />LT Guan Sortollo, assault team, human <br />LT Feren Denken, assault team, Matalinian <br />Ensign Rossinis (twins), engineers, Polynesians <br />Dr. Onnta, OB/GYN, Balosheean <br />Ensign Crandall, engineer, human <br />Totyargvil, baby <br /> <br />Here's hoping that Titan's Book II gets back \\"on course\\" (pun intended, -- minor spoiler). <br />	2005-04-21

I am over 40 and love this book by Ms. Eubank. Speaking about the hardcover, it comes with a Newfoundland dog book mark that is attached to the book by a ribbon. Children love the attached dog. I love the pictures and the Lewis and Clark story as Ms. Eubank tells it. Since the story is written from the point of view of Captain Meriwether Lewis's dog, it is not, of course, \\"accurate,\\" but the expedition story itself is well told through this creative avenue. I have seen more children use this book to learn the story of Lewis and Clark than any other and they never want to put the book down.	2004-10-28

Good for Children	I highly recommend this book as one of the better children's books about the Lewis and Clark Expedition--solely for its wonderfully beautiful and active pictures.  <br /> <br />I acknowledge and appreciate the astute scholar in another review who corrected the author about an error (quite important, actually), but even so, Kroll's choice of story and great pictures outweigh the regrettable error. The story for children comes across very well regardless. The target audience children won't know the difference and it does not detract from the overall story. They will still gain a very good understanding about the mission and hardships Lewis and Clark and their army detachment overcame. Wonderful book. <br />	2004-10-28

If you are looking for a new series for entertaining reading, this is it. <br />This book (#2) is written much better than the first one of the series and I look forward to subsequent books as Lee Goldberg gains experience transitioning from scripts to books.  <br />The Diagnosis Murder series is a cozy-type mystery, so there is no tremendous depth to the stories, but they are entertaining.      <br />If you love the Diagnosis TV series, you will love this new book series. If you are not a fan of the TV series, you can still enjoy these books.<br />Goldberg's humor is very well placed. I especially enjoy the dialog among the well-known characters.<br />If I could offer one word of suggestion to Lee Goldberg and his editors it would be this: Suggest trimming down, or eliminating, direct reference to trendy items or celebrities. To me, they detract from the stories rather than enhance them. But this is my only complaint.<br />If you want to learn about the plot or story line, please read the other reviews. My comments are directed solely to whether or not I think a book is worth buying. In the context of &quot;Diagnosis Murder,&quot; this one is. I liked it a lot better than book #1 as the art of storytelling was vastly improved.	2004-03-24

If you enjoy dropping in on Mr. Q and his cats, then the story will meet your needs, but if you're in need of a great mystery, sadly, you will have to look elsewhere. This was as cozy as a cozy could be. I've never read a cozier cozy--meaning the good guys win, but there was no struggle to do so. The entire mystery was stated point blank. Mr. Q did not even get concerned when a body was found on his own property. There was good potential here, but it was not developed. I have no idea what role the turkeys played. I gave the book 3 stars soley because it entertained me. Ms. Braun has a great sense of humor. If you are new to The Cat Who series, start with a different book and come back to this one once you fall in love with the characters and town.	2004-03-11

If you are new to Rebus, it is good to read the Rebus books in order, but if you have never read one, this book is an excellent story and is a great stand alone.<br />Others already provided story lines, so I won't repeat that here.<BR>What you really want to know is, Is &quot;A Question of Blood&quot; a good DI John Rebus book? The answer is a very definite &quot;Yes.&quot;<br />Rebus fans will welcome this addition to the Rebus series. &quot;A Question of Blood&quot; is Rankin's best one yet.  <br />I thought I figured out the answers, but I was only partially correct. Rankin did an excellent job of twisting up the ending. Each facit of the story could have been developed into a great book itself. <br />I especially enjoyed Rebus's sense of humor in this book. Rebus was in serious trouble, and his humor wasn't meant to be funny per se, but knowing the character Rebus, his wry remarks were hilarious. I never laugh at books trying to make me laugh, but Rankin knows how to stimulate and activate my sense of humor while keeping up the intensity pressure.<br />Why I thought this was Rankin's best Rebus: I was able to stay connected to the story and all its sidelines and was able to visualize Rebus and the other characters as real people. I did not want the story to end.<br />I'm not sure if I really understood the parting shot, or if it was meant to be a mystery in and of itself(?). Good for discussion.<br />TO IAN RANKIN: Please don't put Rebus out to pasture yet. Let him stay around awhile before you pension or kill him off. I'd like to see him work a few more years before he needs a cane, though (in other words, slow down the aging some). And, I hope that army duo will reappear in another story to cause the hero some grief.<br />Great story. Great author. Five stars. Do you want to buy this book? Yes.	2004-02-19

My purpose is to say whether or not I think a book is worth its asking price in exchange for the entertainment it provides. Silent Partner is worth the exchange for its entertainment value.  <br />Dick Van Dyke is my Number One favorite actor. Because I had not seen a Diagnosis Murder (DM) episode on TV since 1999 because I moved outside of the PAX TV signal, when I saw Lee Goldberg's book, Silent Partner, I snatched it up with pleasure. <br />The book reads like a TV episode. I hoped for a more serious book, but the book is truly in keeping with the depth of its television counterpart, which, as fans know, is not exceedingly deep. Entertainment seems to be the main focus of the show and, consequently, the book. <br />B+: for the numerous references to celebrities and products that were popular when the book was being written. This practice locks a book into a particular era and is hard to read once the familiar people and objects are no longer familiar or popular.<br />Lee Goldberg made a \\"clever\\" reference to Dr. Jack Stewart (played by Scott Biao) looking like \\"Chachi\\" on \\"Happy Days.\\"  \\"Happy Days\\" was on TV when I was in high school, but I rarely watched it. Years later, during a dinner party, one of the other guests stared at a poster hanging on the wall behind me. \\"Ooooohhh,\\" She said to our hostess, \\"I love your poster of Scott Biao!\\" <br />I glanced over my shoulder to see what the excitement was about. \\"Oh,\\" I said, \\"I thought that was \\"Chachi.\\" They all laughed and educated me by explaining that Scott Biao was Chachi. Ooookay-so much for face and name recognition. By the way, Scott Biao was my Number Two favorite actor on DM (just behind the Pro, Dick Van Dyke).<br />I found the characterizations in Silent Partner rather shallow and the solution very predictable, but whatever its literary shortcomings may, ormay not, be, this book adds to the enjoyment of \\"Diagnosis Murder\\" in any format. <br />A+: Mr. Goldberg did a good job pacing the action and the humor. I enjoyed the conversations and witty remarks the characters made among themselves. Since the author wrote episodes of DM, the conversations in the book were remarkably like an episode. <br />With a little more practice, Mr. Goldberg's books may be as enjoyable as his TV scripts. Regardless, I was glad I bought Silent Partner and I plan to buy DM Book #2 in Feb 04.<br />Go ahead and put this book in your shopping basket.	2004-01-16

This book is Part 1 of at least 2 parts (who knows?).<br />The story of Daedalus does not resolve by the end of the book. You have to read Book 2 to find out what happens to the people who are all in dire straights. I hope Book 2 ends the story, because I don't want to be caught in a hardcover \\"soap opera.\\" <br />That said, I am looking forward to Daedalus Children (Part 2). I only regret that the publishers spaced the books so far apart. I will have forgotten what this book was about by the time Part 2 is ready for sale and I've already sold my copy of this one.<br />By the time this Daedalus story comes to an end, I also hope that it deviates from what has become \\"standard\\" Star Trek plots (time-space continuum anomalies, etc). I am ready to move on to good science fiction with some new Trek ideas.  <br />As far as Stern's ability to TELL a story, he did a good job. I enjoyed his style. <br />Regardless of my concerns, Daedalus is entertaining enough to be worth the cost of the book.	2004-01-16

I purchased the first one in her scrapbook series, but haven't read it yet. So far, Ms. Childs skills as an author are growing decidedly better with each book.<br />If you are new to the Tea Shop mysteries, Ms. Childs books are  refreshing, entertaining mysteries in light of how horrific real-life has become over the past decade.<br />I prefer mysteries with more substance and greater character development, but I gladly read Ms. Childs' books because I can expect them to be clean, wholesome, and entertaining. To date, Ms. Childs' books are not gruesome or down-right wicked. Again, this is a welcome relief from the majority of mysteries being sold today. <br />The main character is a young woman who balances her business success and yet makes time for a real life besides. I am not a tea-drinker, but I love to read about the tea shop and wish it were a real place. I'd travel all the way to Charleston just to visit her shop if it were real.<br />I heartily recommend you try Laura Childs' books.	2004-01-16

My purpose is to express whether or not, in my opinion, the book is worth trading my hard-earned money for the price on its cover. I thought that &quot;Deny Thy Father&quot; was one of the better Star Trek books published lately.<br />I agree, to some degree, with each previous reviewer. But I gave the book its full five stars because I haven't particularly enjoyed Star Trek books lately, and I enjoyed this one for its entertainment value--not necessarily for its value to the Star Trek storyline. There is a separation of values here. I read the book as a reader looking for something to read solely for its science fiction entertainment merit, and this story entertained me.<br />The Star Trek books aren't exactly literary epic novels and I thought this book was very well done for its subject matter. No, we don't really get into the Ryker heads, but we see some action. While I admit growing extremely board with Ryker Sr's life on the run, overall, the story was entertaining. <br />Would I read a second Star Trek book by Jeff Mariotte? Yes. Did I think the cover price of the book was a fair exchange for its entertainment value? Yes.	2003-12-28

Disch's book, &quot;The Prisoner.&quot; Like some of the other reviewers, I watched many &quot;The Prisoner&quot;  episodes on television several decades ago. As a youngster, I never understood the television series and I won't claim to understand this book, but I liked the show because it was a change from the &quot;norm.&quot; <br />In a nutshell (pun intended), I enjoyed this book soley for its entertainment merit. I wasn't looking for something &quot;new&quot; that was not revealed in the television episodes. I was looking for a &quot;story&quot; and found one.<br />Do you want to buy this book?

The story would have been better if it weren't for some glaring inconsistencies with the Baptist theology and mindset. <br />First of all, the narrator tells us the Baptist minister in the story baptized babies. Baptists don't baptize babies. That is one of their PRIMARY theological distinctions.<br />Second of all, if the young lady in the story read her Bible as much as, and as often as, the story says she did, she would not have, under any circumstances, agreed to the narrator's plan at the end of the book. I cannot say further without giving away an essential part of the plot. Neither would her father have agreed to it. <br />Do you want to buy this book? It is sad. I heard that it was sad before I read it and determined not to cry, but I cried anyway. <br />I object to the foul language--again, this did not make sense in light of the Baptist connection to the narrator.<br />I enjoyed Mr. Sparks's ability to spin a story, but I did not like references to modern events, television shows, or currently popular celebrities. To me, these detract from the story rather than drawing readers in.  <br />If the main character had just been a &quot;nice&quot; girl, rather than a Baptist girl, the story would have been much less offensive and the inherent mistakes could have been avoided.	2003-12-28

I purchased most of this set and am well pleased.<br />I also own the entire set of Gary Moulton's editions (except for the Atlas), and I own many other abridged versions of the Lewis and Clark Expedition. Each version has its merits.<br />I read the Thwaites version of the journals via interlibrary loan many years ago. The books were, of course, very old and the atlas was exceedingly brittle. I wanted to own a copy for scholarly purposes, but could not afford the Real McCoy (those originally published in 1903-1904). As an alternate, I ordered a copy of Thwaites journals by DSI and am glad that I did. If you want an affordable copy of the Thwaites journals, I recommend these by DSI.

This book is an excerpt of the version of the Lewis and Clark journals edited by Reuben Gold Thwaites in 1903-04. Thwaites's version was based on material from the paraphrased Biddle version of 1814. There is an excellent modern non-paraphrased 13-volume version of the journals edited by Dr. Gary Moulton based on original Lewis and Clark materials--also available through Amazon.com. I recommend this book and Dr. Moulton's books.<br />Bakeless chose entries that reflected the broad scope of Captain Meriwether Lewis's mission. Captain Lewis was commissioned by President Thomas Jefferson and Congress in 1803 to conduct an official army expedition across the North American continent to search for a practical trade route. He was to sail up the Missouri River, cross the Rocky Mountains, and sail down the Columbia River to the Pacific Ocean. This feat had never been done before, and Lewis and his army detachment were the first citizens of the United States to cross all the way across from the land east of the Mississippi River to the Pacific Ocean. <br />Bakeless's selection of journal entries gives the reader a very balanced sense of the expedition. We can appreciate the mundane day-to-day activities such as guard duties, court-martials, hunting expeditions, weather reports, as well as exciting entries such as when the men were chased by grizzly bears, nearly fell over cliffs, were nearly drowned, or when confronted by unfriendly westerners (only twice--most of the Native Americans were exceedingly helpful to the expedition and many times, the expeditionaries lives depended on the Native Americans help), and even when Meriwether Lewis was accidentally shot. We even find out which Captain liked to eat dog meat. <br />Considering the wealth of information that the Captains brought back from their journey, Bakeless did an excellent job of choosing what we should read to get a balanced picture of the enormous job those men undertook in one small volume.<br />This is an excellent &quot;beginners&quot; Lewis and Clark Journal. Once you read this book, you will feel compelled to read more. When you do, I recommend editor Dr. Gary Moulton's 12 volume set.<br />This book is not a &quot;childrens&quot; book. It is a nonfiction book for adults or young adults that can appreciate real life adventure.<br />The bottom line is, do you want to buy this book? Yes, you do.	2003-10-01
US	52212365	R30P4PT7FYYB7G	0345456521	233278468	No Graves as Yet: A Novel of World War I, 1st Edition	Books	4	3	6	N	N	No Great Fan as Yet	Per the jacket, No Graves as Yet is the debut episode of a new series by Anne Perry featuring Reverend-Professor Joseph Reavley and his extended family. Reavley's parents and two men from his university are killed or murdered in what appear to be unrelated incidents during one summer. Reavley sets out to discover the truth about his parents and discovers shocking links to all of the deaths.  <br />Ordinarily, I would be thrilled to find one of my favorite authors spawning a new series. But I am holding my congratulations until I read book #2, as this book offered me less entertainment than I expected from the accomplished Ms. Perry.  <br />What I liked about No Graves as Yet: The beginning was highly emotional for me. I wept through the first chapter, but found that the remainder of the book could not evoke any emotion out of me whatsoever--neither grief or tension (except disappointment.)   <br />After Chapter Two, I could not find any suspense at all. No Graves as Yet held a lot of promise for a good story in the beginning, but its momentum fizzled out too soon. The ending felt like a puzzle piece that was forced to fit where it didn't really belong. While it plugged a hole, it did not make the best picture. I hope the author was saving some intrigue for the next book. Sadly, this book did not leave me satisfied or chopping at the bit for the next one. <br />Puzzlements: First of all, Reavley seemed to be a man of very shallow, shaken faith. I cannot imagine why he would feel compelled, by the end of the story, to enter the battlefield where men's souls are in dire need of man of strong faith.  Secondly, what was the purpose for the younger brother Matthew's involvement in the plot after the first chapter? The youngest sister's role seemed utterly foolish to me. Perhaps Ms. Perry plans to build this strong-willed young lady her into a strong woman like her other series' characters, Mrs. Pitt and Mrs. Monk (but I sincerely hope not--I get tired to death of Ms. Perry preaching women's equality all the through her books--enough already! Lets do something different now.).<br />Overall: I hope the next books in this series offer more intrigue and less preaching (pun intended). I thought the peace-war issue was ridiculous and way over done. But, I still like Anne Perry. I hope I like the next book better. I really want to.  So, do you want to buy this book? Sure, why not? Go for it.	2003-09-10

Whatsoever things are pure, think on these things. . .<br /><br />The purpose of my review is let others know whether or not I was satisfied with shelling out the purchase price of a book for the entertainment that the book provided. In this case, no.<br /><br />After I read \\"The Princess,\\" I tossed it into the garbage can at a fast food store. I was mortifyed to read all about a couple's intimacy problems all the way through to the end. That was what the entire book was about!<br /><br />I especially would not recommend this book for Christian teen girls. I was mortifyed at the numerous and never-ending references to this couple's intimacy problems. The entire book dealt with the marriage act. And what woman wants to read about another woman's menstrual problems?<br /><br />Christian people don't read about what people do in bed or, want to do in bed, as the case was in this story. I don't know what Ms. Wick was thinking--well, yes, I do, and for shame! If this book had been made into a film script, I could not watch it. Besides the bubble-bath scene, there was inuendo coming out the ears. I was very alarmed to think that this book is marketed to a Christian market. I've read Harlequin romances that were more wholesome and clean (stories by the late Betty Neels).<br /><br />Over and over again, the princess blushed. Well, I can safely say that I blushed more than she did. My face flamed through this entire book. \\"The Princess\\" had slight potential as a story. I wish I had been Ms. Wick's editor. I would like to be a Beta reader for her next book. Better luck next time.	2003-06-24

Yes, in this case, the entertainment was well worth the exchange. <br />Five stars, A+, a \\"good-job\\" sticker, and high praise for J.M. Dillard. <br />So far, I like Dillard's book better than all of the others written for the Enterprise series (with the exception of \\"Broken Bow\\" which is the novelization of the pilot TV episode. I found \\"Broken Bow\\" useful to get a grip on the \\"new\\" Star Trek crews' characters).  <br />I unreservedly say that Dillard wrote the best Enterprise story so far. Her book reads like a good TV episode. At first, I was exceedingly apprehensive about spending the money on a book with rather larger print and only 218 pages, but I took the chance. I am glad I did.  I read the story slowly to savor it and found that I really enjoyed the book.<br />Other reviews may give synopses of the storyline, so I'll make mine very brief since the purpose of my review is really only to say whether or not I think a book is worth the money it costs. I will take it for granted the you already know who the main characters are and what their relationships to each other are.<br />T'Pol accidently kills an alien and creates a severe philosophical trauma for herself. While she's working to resolve her inner conflict, the Enterprise crew, and ultimately Earth, are threatened by an alien entity. T'Pol must decide whether or not to aid the crew by using violence or not. The story is filled with philosophy (which I never enjoy, but it was essential to the story), emotion (Dillard did a very good job in this department), and action (again, she did a great job with the action scenes). <br />To sum up, I am very well pleased overall with \\"Surak's Soul\\" as a new edition to the Enterprise series. I haven't been tremendously happy with the other books in the series, but Dillard revived my hope that Pocket Books found a great voice for telling Enterprise stories. Ihope Dillard will write many more books for this new fun group of Star Trek stars. <br />Also, I would like to praise the cover-designer as well. Good job.	2003-03-22

It starts out real gory, but hang in there (no pun intended), it will turn into an incredible romance. <br />About 20 years ago, a college friend urged me to read the Scarlet Pimpernel. I read the first few pages and was so horrified by the bloodshed that I did not read further. That was a big mistake.<br />After I graduated, I spotted the unabridged book in a CHILDREN's section of a library. What!? I checked it out and after I read past the first chapter or two, the story was so wonderful that I've been recommending it ever since. <br />The first few gory pages set the scene. After you get through that the story develops into an amazing romance with lots of adventure.<br />Warning: if you expect this book to end like the movie with Jane Seymour in it, it doesn't. The movie ending is actually the ending of one of the Scarlet Pimpernel sequels. <br />This book has an OK ending, but if you want to read the dramatic ending that the movie has, you will also have to read one of the sequels, too--only I don't remember exactly which one it was.<br />From what I remember the Baroness's husband helped her write the story and you can see his hand in it, I think, which really makes a great story. There are elements in it that are really action-packed and then there are the tender scenes. All nicely done, not too syrupy. <br />This is a great book. Go for it. Read it, then the sequels. Also, I liked both versions of the movie. The old black and white with Leslie Howard and then the more modern version with Jane Seymore.	2003-03-03

My only objection to the book was its ocassional bad language (the story setting is in a &quot;rough&quot; place).<br />Cox did an excellent job of describing the action scenes and describing Daredevil's handicap. <br />I thought this was an excellent screenplay book and I would like to see Cox write his own Daredevil episode for a more mature audience, that is, with a more complex plot.<br />This book tell the story of how Daredevil came into being and why. It starts at a point in the present and flashes back to the hero's childhood. We see him blinded in an accident and learn what drives him to become a vigalante in his adulthood.<br />The story then jumps to a more recent past that leads to the opening scene. <br />We are introduced to his professional partner and a new romantic interest. <br />The complexities of his childhood become interwoven with his adult life as can only happen in a book, but it is an entertaining story. <br />The ending has a slight twist and leaves the reader with a good feeling.<br />Put this one in your shopping cart and enjoy a good story.	2003-03-03

Buy it, if for no other reason, than the supplementary note in the front of the book that exlains the Scottish police force chain of command. No longer do we North Americans have to wonder whether a DC takes home more in his &quot;pay packet&quot; than an ACC. Or what a &quot;wooley suiter&quot; is. Hey, you can use this handy list when you watch &quot;Frost&quot; and other British police shows popping up on PBS stations or on Canadian TV whose signals stretch over the borders. Better yet, use it when you see a &quot;John Rebus&quot; special on TV over here when you can find one showing. <br />I won't go into the story details--other reveiws have done a good job on doing that, but what I will say is that I thought the story started out very well. There were many exciting possibilities in it (A+) for that. But, I would have liked to see a lot more ending action. But overall, I still give the book 5 stars (4 for the story and 1 for the supplementary info)<br />For new comers:<br />The John Rebus stories are a series. Each book is fine as a stand alone. I read them out of order and liked them anyway, but if you have an opportunity, read them in order. However, this particular story does very well as a stand alone if you want to read it first and then start from the beginning. Rebus is a detective with personal problems--which seem to aid his work rather than detract from it. It is fun to watch him sometimes suffer, sometimes stumble, but always work methodically through a case. Rebus is a very human character.<br />End of comments	2003-02-18

I would like to live in Pickax (during the summer, that is).<br />For newcomers, this story is more entertaining than sinister. If you're looking to buy entertainment, this book is it. For us tried-and-true fans, the \\"mystery\\" has become secondary to the characters. I'll forgive the transparent story line this time just because I've missed these people and was anxious to read about them once again. <br />I thank G P Putnam's Sons for publishing this non-horrific murder mystery. Doesn't it seem as though publishers these days act as though they think a story has to be more gruesome that the next to sell? Well, Ms. Braun proves them all wrong. She spins a humorous tale tinged in mystery-enough to satisfy those who want to see Koko do his tricks.  <br />This book is suitable for the Christian market and teens wanting to grow up from Nancy Drew and the Hardy Boys.  <br />For Pickax fans, two thumbs up.	2003-02-15

If you are one of Lilian Jackson Braun's &quot;The Cat Who. . . &quot; fans, then, Yes. <br />This is a book you can read in one sitting if you like. It is not a mystery, but rather just what the title says, a collection of little &quot;tall&quot; tales that are written as though the main character in the series, Mr. Q, would write if he were a real author. <br />I thought the book was exceedingly charming and although I can barely wait between publications of Bruan's mystery books, I thoroughly enjoyed this little collection. The idea of it is extremely novel and I would say it is a success from her fans' point of view.<br />Some of the stories were already mentioned, or alluded to, in some of the author's other &quot;The Cat Who. . . &quot; books, but that was OK. It was a good refresher and the stories really do cement the flavor of Moose County. <br />Again, I cannot say how much I just enjoyed the &quot;chit-chattiness&quot; of this little, easy-to-read volume. Ms. Braun has an amazing imagination--that is, she is able to reign it in and make it &quot;fit&quot; the imaginary people of Moose County. My railroader father especially enjoyed the tale about the hoghead.<br />I also enjoyed the size of the book. It was light and easy to hold and felt very comfortable in my hands. <br />I am looking forward to getting my hands on The Cat Who Brought Down the House soon.<br />If you are new to Ms. Braun, this book is probably not the one you should start out with. But buy it anyway and set it aside until after you read a few of The Cat Who books. After you are well introduced to the characters of Moose County, pull out this little book. If you wait, you will be able to really enjoy it better that way.	2003-01-26

In this case, yes, if you love DS9 and are up to date in its story-line.<br />Because I stopped watching the DS9 TV series when the Dominion War started, I came to &quot;Cathedral&quot; as a not-up-to-date fan. Because I was not up to date on the DS9 story, &quot;Cathedral&quot; was very difficult to follow. And, if you don't know anything about the planet Bajor and its struggles, the story is also exceedingly difficult to follow. I really had no clue as to the roles of the people involved in the power struggle.<br />And of course, an alien race appeared to complicate the story, but for me, their presence didn't add any value to the story. Actually, by the time they showed up, I was annoyed with their interrupting the story that I just finally getting comfortable with.<br />I wanted to read &quot;Cathedral&quot; because the book's hook was a good one: I wanted to see how the authors handled Dr. Bashir's loss of his bioengineered talents. I think their initial idea was great, but they did not do a terrific job of presenting it. Like another reviewer, I was baffled how the Dr could mentally deteriorate at such an alarming rate but write about it so well in his log. It was not convincing.<br />Overall, I found the entire story rather difficult to follow. <br />Be that as it may, if you are a DS9 fan, you might really love the story regardless of the difficulties I encountered. I thought the authors wrote well--I just wasn't very fond of the story. Maybe better luck next time for me.<br />The other reviewers give reviews of the story lines, so I won't repeat them here. I just wanted to say that I think the story had potential for entertainment, but just not for me--this time. But, you can give it a try if you are a DS9 fan.	2002-12-31

In this case, my opinion is a resounding &quot;Yes.&quot; If you're shopping today, put this book in your cart and run to the checkout.<br />This book is a &quot;little nugget.&quot; It is about 4 x 7 inches which should easily fit into a woman's average-sized handbag for easy reference. But, good news, this isn't a book that you need to tote with you to the supermarket. Dr. Shapiro shares some very simple principles that if you pay attention to, you can shop without any kind of guide and fill you grocery cart full of weight-conscious selections. I have already begun to use some of the principles Dr. Shapiro suggested. <br />Basically, the book is filled with good, common sense. Two things I found extremely helpful were his discussions on peanut-butter and on drinks we buy to swallow.  He dispelled a common peanut butter &quot;myth&quot; and makes us aware that we have a choice between chewing our calories or swigging them down. <br />Dr. Shapiro's book also has helpful little hints and sidebars with comparisons in the book that are absolutely eye-opening. There is a small calorie-counter section in the back, if you want one. <BR>By the way, Dr. Shapiro's tone in the book is light and refreshing. It makes you want to make the best decisions for yourself.	2002-10-23

Rather, I like to let a potential shopper know whether or not the book being reviewed is, in my opinion, worth the cover price and whether or not he or she should go ahead and put this book in his/her shopping basket. In this case, go ahead.<br />This is directed mostly to Anne Perry fans that normally like her &quot;William Monk&quot; series. You will enjoy this new Monk novel. Once I got to Chapter Three, I pretty much had to read the book all the way through. Once I got near the end, I couldn't put it down until the story was finished. <br />Let me praise Ms. Perry for departing from her usual sordid crimes. This is the second such Monk book that centers around a &quot;standard&quot; crime. <br />Let me also praise Carl D. Galian for an excellent jacket design. Sometimes I like his jackets better than the story. This time, I liked both.<br />Although I found the mystery part of the story quite compelling, I withheld one star because I just cannot stand Ms. Perry's philosophizing. Her plots are good enough without her wasting my time filling her story with controversial issues which may be her niche, but I cannot stand it. <br />As I said, philosophy aside, the story was great. Ms. Perry is a master at teasing the reader. Monk, as the fan knows, lost his memory in an accident. Ms. Perry begins to tease some of it back, but in just the tiniest, most tantalizing tidbits that keeps the reader nervous until the very end of the story. If you are a lip-chewer, then beware, get your lip protection cream handy.<br />Thumbs Up for Anne Perry once again.	2002-10-20

Whether or not you like Sherlock Holmes stories (I don't), you will love both this story and the reading of it. Hecht is a marvelous reader.<br />What I liked best about this story was its inventive science fiction for the time when it was written, and what I loved most about this story was Doyle's use of words themselves. I love how he pictures people and develops their characters.<br />The plot is spelled out in other reivews, so this review is just to tell you that the tapes themselves are great and the story is great too, (if not a little long and drawn out in some places). But as a reviewer, I must caveat the &quot;great&quot; by adding that I disagree with Doyles' use of the theory of evolution, but if you take that with the grain of salt for a science fiction story, it can pass for what it is - science fiction.<br />I thoroughly enjoyed the exploits of Professor Challenger, the reporter Malone, Sir John Roxton, and Professor Sommerly. There is a sequel of sorts, &quot;The Poison Belt&quot; which is an entertaining story as well and also read by Hecht(this story is much shorter and a little on the &quot;dark&quot; side). But overall, I wish Doyle wrote more science fiction and less mystery.<br />This is a good audio book to take with you on a long trip, or to listen to on a daily commute. I nearly missed going inside to work some days because the story got so good in places.<br />Listen and enjoy.	2002-10-10

Buy &quot;Fast Food Nation&quot; AND read it. This book is one that every adult and every parent or grandparent and any one involved in city planning should read. <br />Did you know that there are 7 types of whining children do? The fast food industry exploits one or more of them. <br />This book is a real eye-opener as pertains to our potatoe, meat, and chicken food industries. The author does a superb job of revealing the goals of the food industry in America and of showing how they changed the way food is produced and handled and how those changes changed our lives.<br />I was particularly interested in two chapters that dealt with minors: how the industry targets children and why they employ them when they are older. <br />I also loved the portions of the book that revealed how the food industry deals with the public on a psychological level. <br />What I found most fascinating was information on &quot;added&quot; flavors. <br />Even if you don't use fast-food, you need to read this book because it exposes a great deal about the packaged meat and chicken industry. Once upon a time, my uncle was a chicken farmer for a major chicken-user, so I know what is said about that is true.<br />Overall, this was a great book. It informed, educated, and entertained. The author uses real stories to emphasize his points. <br />Personally, I believe every city council member and all of Congress needs to read this book, too. This book might not change your eating habits, but at least after you read Fast Food Nation, you will eat with your eyes open.	2002-10-10

Even though the story is a novelization of a teleplay, kudos to author Michael Teitelbaum. While the target audiences are different I would still say that Teitelbaum did a better job writing the novelization of the Smallville teleplay than Carey who wrote the novelization \\"Broken Bow\\" for Enterprise (Star Trek). Teitelbaum also appears to be a better story-teller than the authors of #2 See No Evil. I am not referring to imagination; I am referring to the art of putting words on paper.<br />\\"Arrival\\" tells the story of Superman's journey from adolescence towards manhood. The story introduces the Man of Steel and his nemesis Lex Luther.  \\"Arrival\\" begins with a toddler-aged Superman dramatically landing on earth during a meteor shower and then jumps to his high school experience. In this story, the young superman's character is developed. His experiences lead him toward maturity and cause him to learn about himself, real life values, and the meaning of self-control.  Other characters from the television series Smallville are also introduced: Lana Lang, Chloe Sullivan, Pete Ross, and football star Whitney.  <br />The story is fast paced and exciting. The young superman Clark Kent faces normal teenage conflicts of school and home. He fears being labeled a nerd by his school mates and seeks the approval of his peers. In the process, he learns that he must prioritize the values in his life and sets the course of his pending manhood. <br />If you are a fan of the Smallville television series, but missed the first episode (which I did), you will enjoy \\"Arrival.\\"  It sets the stage for future episodes and explains the relationships of the teens and adults in the series.  <br />STAR  rating:  As much as I enjoyed the story, I give the Smallville series #1  \\"Arrival\\"  only three stars for the following reasons. <br />I withheld one star because of its inclusion of profanity and crude language. The book uses the words \\"b*****d\\" , \\"d***\\", \\"h***\\"  and \\"cr**\\" which are especially inappropriate for minor readers. Just because it is mostly adults in the story who use the profanity does not make it acceptable.  Also, stating that Clark fell on his b***  is crude. <br />I withheld another star due to descriptions of teenagers passionately kissing. Teenagers may have adult-looking bodies, but they do not possess adult wisdom. I object to writing about mature subjects for immature people. It creates peer pressure for minors to become physically involved with people before they are capable of making sound, rational adult decisions. <br />If Little, Brown, and Company would edit out these shortcomings in future printings, I would incrase my rating of this young adult book to a full five stars.	2002-09-30

Smallville High senior, Dawn Mills, discovers a power to harm people through the use of the notorious Smallville meteor rocks. She uses a meteor rock to make herself invisible and uses this unique power to revel in lust and exact revenge.

His painful shyness is portrayed and in the process of helping his school mates, he learns more about himself and takes another step towards maturity.<BR> However, Smallville See No Evil #2 is filled (and I do mean f-i-l-l-e-d) with deplorable profanity, suggestiveness, belittlement of authority, and over-the-edge violence.

Ms. Childs is well on her way to becoming a good mystery writer although I did not give the book a full five stars. I held one star back for this first book in the series only because the book has a slightly amateurish feel to it, just like the main character, Ms. Theodosia Browning, who is an amateur sleuth. This book is a good introduction into adult mystery stories for young women--it is very adult without being smutty or dirty. It gets 5 stars for being \\"clean.\\"<br />If you love to sit with a tea cup in your hand while reading, this book is definitely for you.<br />I look forward to reading \\"Gunpowder Green\\" another of Ms. Child's books as soon as I can to see if both the Ms. Browning and Ms. Childs' writing has matured.<br />Short-short synopsis: Theodosia owns a tea shop, caters an event where a guest dies from drinking the tea, and snoops to find the murderer. There are clues, which I missed, and when the person who committed the murder was revealed, I thought Ms. Childs made a very clever choice of the characters.<br />Things about the book I liked:<BR>I loved the cover design.

Memphis mentioned that the book focused on academia--well, what else is a serious nonfiction book? For me, the review only confirmed that this was the book I'd been looking for! <br />    None of the local booksellers have stock yet, so my impatient search ended in a library. After reading only one chapter, I knew I had to own this book. I've read only two chapters so far and am flipping out of my seat in anxiety to get to work on my proposal after reading even only this much. Since I have to own this book, I ordered \\"Thinking Like Your Editor\\" from Amazon.com today.  <br />    Why does this book mean so much to me after reading even just the first two chapters? Because the first two chapters have so many nuggets of valuable information in them, that I can see clearly why I have been having trouble getting my own book to fly. My queries have been getting great results, but after I submit my proposal and sample chapter, I get the heave-ho. Now I know why. All my shortcomings are fixable and I cannot wait to start correcting them. This book has restored my self confidence. I know now what I have to do.<br />    I realize that I haven't told you what is in the book, some ofthe other reviewers did that for you as did the publisher above. I'm too excited to write more to you--I've got to get working on my book.<br />    Yes, buy this book if you want to write and publish serious nonfiction. Good luck to you. Hope to see your title on the shelf (if it is decent). <br />And thank you to Memphis. I appreciate honestly-felt reviews and yours helped me, although perhaps not in the way you might have thought. <br />An author-in-the-making	2002-04-10

In this case, yes. Go ahead and buy one. It will be money well spent. I rated this book with 5 stars because its price accurately reflects the worth of its contents. <br />I appreciate this book. It was easy to read and understand. I learned about this book from a friend who read bits of it to me over the telephone. She picked it up to help her deal with a specific troubled professional relationship. <br />This book is short...!!! This book is reader-friendly...! This book is affordable--...!!!! <br />This book provides helpful information for both men and women, but I think that it should be required reading for every woman. <br />I plan to buy a couple of these books to give as gifts. I especially want to send one to my old (and former) college roommate.	2002-04-01

I wish that I liked Robinson because he wrote an awful lot of pages and I like a long story--after all, for the price we pay for books these days, I like a story to take some time to read.  Robinson wins the prize for that aspect of a story, but I, as a first time reader, did not find the HMS Unseen worth the time I put into reading the plot. It was to me, like a song without end (1,000,000,000 bottles of pop on the wall type of story). <br />The story started out well enough to capture my initial interest, but there was not enough involvement by the winner in this story to keep me captivated. <br />I did not like the quick-feel ending (I call this the Charles-Dickens-syndrome). While some like the way Robinson solved the &quot;bad-guy&quot; situation, I thought it was totally unconvincing. A man like the bad-guy just would NOT do what he did for any reason. I think Robinson tried to set the reader up for the end section by giving very slight hints in the beginning of the story and throughout, but the set-up was too small and insignificant for what happened at the end (Laura). To repeat myself, it just wasn't convincing. For one thing, he could have joined the IRA or some South American group not to mention China or Russia. <br />I guess I want to say that I wanted to enjoy the book, but didn't. Robinson is a good story teller, I just didn't like this story.<br />Do you want to buy it? A definite maybe.	2002-04-01

Other reviewers like to give plot analyses, I like to generalize about whether a new reader can &quot;safely&quot; spend his or her money on the book and not be grossly disappointed. <br />All of the &quot;Cat Who&quot; books by Lilian Jackson Braun are good entertainment. These stories are &quot;clean&quot; and Braun has a sense of humor that I thoroughly enjoy. I rarely chuckle when I read, but Mark Twain and Lilian Jackson Braun can make me laugh out loud. <br />I eagerly look forward to each new &quot;The Cat Who...&quot; book by Lilian Jackson Braun. If you are contemplating buying this book and have never read any books by Braun, go ahead, you'll enjoy Braun. <br />Just so you know, the cats in the story do not talk and they do not do things that are terribly unbelievable. If you've ever owned a cat, you can relate to the cats' behavior. If you're a  dog-or-bird-only person, you will still love these stories (and be glad you have a dog or bird!).<br />Each &quot;The Cat Who&quot; book is a stand-alone story, but you might enjoy them better if you read them in order of publication. My personal opinion is that the older books are more enjoyable--probably because the author was fresh then and took more time fleshing out the characters, but I still enjoy each new title as it appears each January. I wish Ms. Braun could publish one a month. . . .<br />If you are from Michigan, you will certainly enjoy seeing a few familiar places mentioned in &quot;The Cat Who Went up the Creek&quot; and will howl with laughter at Braun's &quot;The Cat Who Went to Breakfast&quot; for its depiction of the disguised Mackinac Island. <br />If you are from &quot;anywhere&quot; NORTH, you will totally love the &quot;Cat Who&quot; series after Qwil moves from &quot;down below&quot; to the north. If you are from the south, you are missing a lot - of cold weather. These books will make up for your misfortune.<br />I gave this book 4 stars only because I like the older books better--the main character Qwil was more actively involved in the mysteries of the older stories. Although I enjoyed reading about Qwil this time in &quot;The Cat Who Went Up the Creek,&quot; I got too full eating all the way through the story with him and his dinner guests. <br />For a quick look at the contents, the main character &quot;vacations&quot; at an Inn where bodies turn up at different times floating in the creek. The cast of characters include the Inn owners and vacationing guests. The butler did not do it.	2002-02-04

Every woman should learn Successful Language	My only reqret is that Dr. Mindell wrote &quot;A Woman's Guide to the Language of Success: Communicating With Confidence and Power&quot; after I had earned my masters degree (this book should have been required reading) and after I already became deeply entrenched in my current career. My goal is to use the principles taught in &quot;Language of Success&quot; to help me dig myself out of my work rut and into a higher-paying position.<br />Dr. Mindell's book is a &quot;must-read&quot; and a &quot;must-do-what-you-read&quot; book for every woman. <br />This book should be required reading for every woman whether or not she earned a high school diploma or college degree. If she works with, or for, people of any gender, this book should be mandatory reading. <br />This book should be required reading for any mother or guardian with any type of daughter (or with a son exhibiting timid tendencies) so that she could train her child to use the language of success principles that Dr. Mindell teaches.<br />The concepts provided are simple, yet powerful. The book is clearly written and Dr. Mindell even uses humor; this is not a &quot;grammar&quot; book.<br />A suggestion: before you read the book, take two or three minutes and write a pretend written memo directing &quot;someone&quot; to do an unpleasant task. You don't HAVE to do this to learn from the book but it will be fun and you can use the memo as a benchmark to learn about yourself and compare it to later business writing after you learn how to use the language of success. <br />I learned a lot about myself from &quot;The Language of Success.&quot; I learned that there are a lot of changes that I need to make. They are simple changes, but until I read this book, I was totally unaware of how &quot;weak&quot; I come across in the business arena.<br />I instantly began to use Dr. Mindell's suggestions, right from the first chapter. I know that as I put her concepts into practice, that I will reach my professional and personal goals.<br />Example of two easy rules to improve your image are to:<BR> 1. Avoid using &quot;like&quot; as in: The presentation was like real good.<BR> 2. Avoid using &quot;I think&quot; when you really &quot;know&quot; something. Don't start a sentence by saying, &quot;I think we really ought to do such and such.&quot; Just say, &quot;We ought to do such and such.&quot;<BR> etc., etc., etc. <br />Don't worry: the &quot;Language of Sucess&quot; principles won't turn you into a rude woman when you put them into practice, but they will improve your image of authority without making you appear overbearing.<br />Please buy this book if you are a woman--whether you work in your home or for a Fortune 500 business. Doesn't matter. Read it.<BR>I wish I learned the principles of &quot;Successful Language&quot; when I was a child. <br />-From a satisfied customer and new Language of Success &quot;student&quot;	2002-01-29

I like the new Enterprise TV series, but so far, the books have not measured up to my version of Star Trek quality. The book gets 3 stars from me just because I like the cover and am glad that there is a book on Enterprise to read regardless of its literary value. <br />\\"By the Book\\" is, in a large part, a tale about a Role Playing Game (RPG) that I found extremely boring. If you are into RPGs, you will love this book; if you are not, you will not find the book exciting.<br />Thoughts to share:<br />1. The Role Playing Game seemed to be the focus of the book rather than the Enterprise adventure. The authors tried to pull the two together, but failed, in my opinion. <br />2. The story did not provide enough \\"conflict\\" to make my trip into outer space worth my $7. There was an encounter with an alien that went bad. But, because the affected crewman was not a senior officer, the disaster did not create enough reader concern. Had the man been one of the Main Seven (Bridge crew plus Dr. Phlox and Trip), the story may have had a different impact. Overall--this story just wasn't that great. Its like a flat pop. You can drink it, but you won't really savor it.<br />3. The authors are trying to get into the Captain Archer's head but they are really making him look sappy instead of like a man who possesses real leadership quality. Star Trek fans are used to James T. Kirk and JeanLuke Picard standards. The Archer that is being developed by the recent authors make it seem like it wasn't just the ship that left earth's dock too soon--it seems like the captain left earth's dock too soon, as well.<br />I hope for better Enterprise books in the future.<br />Do you want to buy this book? How can I say \\"No\\" to the second book of the series? So, sure, if you want an Enterprise story for the sake of reading about the Enterprise. But if you want a really good Star Trek book, this one should go near the bottom of your wish list.	2002-01-26

I want to say, keep reading.<br />The first few chapters only set the scene. After you wade through them, the story picks up marvelously.<br />A college friend begged me to read this book when I was in college. I picked it up but couldn't stomach the first few chapters.  I put it down. When I was studying for my master's degree, I picked it back up and loved it once I got past that stuff in the beginning.<br />Also, if you saw the movie first (any version), you won't find the movie ending in the book. The movie ending comes from a SP sequel. <br />I catorgize this book as a romance. Yes, there is adventure, but the conflict is that the Scarlet Pimpernel married the love of his life only to lose trust in her on their wedding day when he discovers that she was responsible for a dasterdly deed that cost a French family their lives. His secret life must be hid from his wife as well as the rest of England and France. As the story unfolds, the wife must learn to depend on her husband, whom she comes to regard as a complete idiot, and he must learn to forgive her. <br />Once you get past the gorey beginning, the story is great.<BR>So, hang in there and read, read, read, and enjoy.	2002-01-26

My purpose for writing this review is not to tell the plot and what I thought about it. After this many reviews, that type of review might be better served on a chat board. My purpose is to let you know whether or not you might want to shell out your hard-earned cash for this book. (This was my first book that I read by Brad Meltzer, so take what I say with a grain of salt.)<br />So, the question is, do you want to buy this book? If you are going on a long trip or have lots of hours to while away the time, sure, go for it.<br />If your purpose is to read a good mystery--you might want to buy it. Meltzer does about as good a job as the average mystery writer these days. Or, you can buy two books with half the pages and enjoy two mysteries instead of one long one.<br />I was interested in The First Counsel up to a point. But 509 pages is quite a long tale. I got tired of it about page 298.<br />The story felt like the author put it down once in awhile and forgot where he was going with it. The ending did not make any sense to me at all. It felt like the author picked a character at the end of the book and said, \\"OK, you be the bad guy now.\\" It didn't feel like a twist; it just felt wrong. There were too many clues that did not point to the actual killer. You could not fathom why the killer did what he did or figure out how he was privy to so much information.<br />The book has the feel of a thriller movie script with too much repeat action. <br />Like I said, though, if you like a long story, this will fit the bill.<br />What I did not like:<br />1. The countless references to the human body and its functions (way to much of that).<br />2. There are way-too-many Germanisms: you know, hyphenated modifiers like: His not-very-cool dad wore his 1960s-hippy-poncho-thingy and his red-hot-and-firey-don't-you-know-there's-not-another-pair-like-it-in-the-whole-wide-world-anymore-count-your-lucky-stars checkered slacks.  <br />What I did like:<br />The author told a lot of details about working at the White House complex. I actually liked all that. That is a world that I know nothing about. So as far as that goes, the story took me somewhere I had never been before. Good job on that aspect of the story.<br />My recommendation:<br />Go for it at least once. I might have wanted to read another of his books, but this one's pace wore me out. I'm too old at 40 for the heart attacks. If you like fast action, this is for you.<br />If you want to make a movie out of it, please change the ending.<br />Enjoy!	2002-01-22

Could the script have been fleshed out better in a book? I don't really know, maybe some.<br />If you did not watch the pilot episode of &quot;Enterprise&quot; and wonder what is going on, definitely read this book.<br />If you are looking for another great Star Trek book, this one rates three stars. Again--not all Diane's fault.<br />But, to understand my mid-range rating of this book, you must understand my point of view when it comes to Star Trek books:  I enjoyed viewing all of the various Star Trek series on television until both the cast and story lines wore out. I am an avid reader and enjoy some, but not all, of the Star Trek: Next Generation, Deep Space-9, and Voyager series books. I do not enjoy nor read books about the TOS (the original series).<br />I am enthusiastic about the new &quot;Enterprise&quot; series but I wasn't when the pilot episode aired. I changed my mind and began to appreciate and enjoy the new series after reading &quot;Broken Bow&quot; and some articles in Star Trek: The Magazine and Star Trek Communicator magazines (recent issues which explained the focus and differences of the new Star Trek show). Diane's book also contains a very useful section at the end of the book explaining much of the same as the magazines. <br />I tried to watch the pilot episode twice (it airs on Wed and Sun in my area). I was not interested enough to watch either airing all the way through, but I like the series, anyway, after watching subsequent episodes.  <br />I found the initial TV episode somewhat confusing. I thought that if I read Diane's book, it would fill in the gaps of the TV episode that I did not watch.It did. <br />What the book is about: &quot;Broken Bow&quot; is set prior to the original TV series with Captain Kirk and is about the maiden voyage of the Enterprise. In this book and series, the captain is Starfleet, but there is no Federation.  He is the first captain to have warp 4.5 capability and is the first to have the opportunity to go beyond the known and travelable universe. Earth is aware of aliens (Vulcans and some others). The crew has two aliens: the doctor and science officer. Of course, there is plenty of drama and action.<br />Do you want to read this book?  <br />Yes, if you want to know about the crew members of the Enterprise and what makes the captain tick. <br />Yes, if you want to read a new Star Trek book--but it is not as well done as it could have been had Diane been left to her own imagination.<br />I look forward to reading other &quot;Enterprise&quot; books.  I hope Diane Carey writes some of them and that she can use her own skills and imagination. <BR>End of comment.	2001-12-05

I sailed with ease through my college composition courses and I annually compose about a thousand messages and memos to perform my job. Therefore, I thought there was nothing that I could learn about writing from a simple, entertaining book like \\"Painless Writing.\\"  I was wrong.<br />I was excited to discover that some of the topics and techniques covered in \\"Painless Writing\\" were new to me. For instance, I had never encountered the term \\"nominalizations\\" before.  If that term is new to you, too, don't worry; you'll find out how to use them properly. Also, I was surprised to learn that the term \\"expletive construction\\" did not pertain to words best left out of fine, cultured writing, but rather, it refers to sentences beginning with the words \\"there are,\\" \\"it is,\\" etc.<br />\\"Painless Writing\\" simply explains each new topic and then provides exercises with answers to allow you to practice the new skills and techniques being covered. These exercises are not dull and boring like those we suffered with in our grammar books once-upon-a-time ago; they are entertaining and delightful.<br />Sample examples show both \\"poor\\" and \\"better\\" writing. I thought this method of teaching was extremely helpful.<br />The test answers are written out completely and then explained by the author.  So, if you choose a wrong answer, you can see why the other answer was correct. This extra effort on the author's part is invaluable.<br />Another feature that I liked was the page numbering.  \\"Say, what?\\" you say. Yes, I loved the page numbering.  Each page number is written large enough for even forty-year old eyes to read and highlighted in a pink circle making it easy to see (this is great for flipping to the answer section).<br />I have already begun to incorporate some techniques that I learned from this book into both my private and professional writing.<br />Good job, Jeffrey Strausser.<br />The contents cover the following topics: Preposition clutter, enlivening writing, silencing the passive voice, reducing nominalizations/activating your writing, smoothing out your writing, using commas (not a boring chapter! you'll like it), adding rhythm to your writing, ten common writing errors (several of which I needed review), and for those still in school-a real bonus-a template for writing a term paper.<br />End of comments.ld eyes to read and highlighted in a pink circle making it easy to see (this is great for flipping to the answer section).<br />I have already begun to incorporate some techniques that I learned from this book into both my private and professional writing.<br />Good job, Jeffrey Strausser.<br />The contents cover the following topics: Preposition clutter, enlivening writing, silencing the passive voice, reducing nominalizations/activating your writing, smoothing out your writing, using commas (not a boring chapter! you'll like it), adding rhythm to your writing, ten common writing errors (several of which I needed review), and for those still in school-a real bonus-a template for writing a term paper.<BR>End of comments.	2001-11-26

The purpose of this review is not to tell the plot but rather to assure Perry fans that her &quot;Funeral in Blue&quot; is a fine piece of storytelling. <br />If you are a William Monk fan, you will enjoy this book especially if you are more interested in puzzles than Perry-philosophy. &quot;Funeral in Blue&quot; has a better balance between storytelling and philosophy than most of the recent Monk novels. If you liked &quot;The Face of a Stranger,&quot; you will be relieved to read &quot;Funeral in Blue&quot; because it seemed that the recent Monk novels focused more on the &quot;other&quot; characters than Monk and his wife Hester; this book returns its focus to its namesake.<br />I rated the book like this: Two stars for Ms. Perry returning her focus to Mr. and Mrs. Monk; two stars for Ms. Perry departing, thank goodness, from her usual sordid murder to a crime less gruesome than is her wont; and two stars for the mystery itself.  I know that two plus two plus two is six stars, but this mystery novel rated an additional star.  <br />Because Ms. Perry has become somewhat predictable, I had a pretty good idea who the culprit would be (and I was correct), but I have to admit that she did a good job of trying to make me change my mind several times. Give Ms. Perry an A+ for this addition to her Monk series.  Once I picked up &quot;Funeral in Blue,&quot; I had to read it all the way through. If you like Perry, this one is worth buying.	2001-11-13

Asprin's Phules books for a good start. I recommend that you read them in order.  Start with this one, &quot;Phule's Company.&quot;   The other reviewer answered some plot questions, so I won't repeat any of that here. The purpose of this review is solely to say that this book and its series are an OK place to start looking for an alternative source of light science fiction.<br />There is nothing too heavy, too outrageious, or too violent in this series. They are somewhat dated (Phule uses something very akin to a laptop computer and wireless communication which was way-out science fiction when the first book was written). But, you can overlook that if you want to just enjoy a fun read (similar to the Doc Savage-type books where an answering machine was an fabulous invention).<br />Asprin uses some good old-fashioned character conflict to keep the reader interested. Everyone loves an underdog (which Phule is) that makes good.  Phule isn't perfect, but he tries hard to do a good job even if it involves some risk and is a likeable character. <br />I gave the book 4 stars because it is &quot;OK.&quot;  I reserve five-star ratings for larger, more complex plots, and books that leave me feeling put out to sea, or at least decidedly different.<br />Go ahead and buy this book, you cannot help but be entertained.	2001-06-06

This book accomplishes its mission; it identifies many obvious mistakes that beginner writers make but ought to avoid--simple mistakes that could cause both editors or readers alike to reject a story and, ultimately, its author. My recommendation to a beginner fiction writer is to read this book now. I'd like to offer a backhanded compliment for this book, as well: //WARNING: if you are a person who just wants to read fiction for pleasure (and do not want to write fiction for profit), then don't read this book because it exposes the mystique of well-written fiction.// I am wildly enthusiastic about this book and am glad that Writer's Digest Books is still offering this gem. This book is well written in an easy-to-understand style. Bickham's examples are clear and meaningful. This book can be read and digested in small segments (each chapter ranges from 1 to three or four pages) or at one sitting.  It can be used as a handy reference, tool, too.  My copy is heavily highlighted for quick referral. I heartily look forward to reading other books on writing by Jack M. Bickham and will probably look for his novels, too (to study and hopefully enjoy as well).	2001-06-04

For fans who did not find &quot;The Cat Who Saw Stars&quot; her best will find this new story was up to her previous standards. We can sigh a breath of relief and hope for more stories in the future.     This story had all the favorite and looked-for Qwilleran features: the small-town atmosphere with large-town crime on a small-town scale. I really enjoyed this story which is a change for the past one or two.  There was no high-tension, but that is one reason that I enjoy Ms. Braun's stories.  I chuckled all the way through this one.  It takes a great deal to bring a smile to my lips while I read and this one actually made me chuckle right out loud many times.      I found no part of this book dull or flat.  This story took off at its normal Braun pace and never let up.  If you are a previous Braun fan, you can buy this book without fearing you'll be disappointed or waste your money.

I thoroughly enjoyed Ms. Perry's first William Monk story, &quot;The Face of a Stranger,&quot; as the character she created was interesting and his dilemma intriguing. However, I did not feel that &quot;Slaves of Obsession&quot; held the same fascination.  There was very little about the inner workings and turmoils of Monk and, as always, there was too much time and attention devoted to Hester.  &quot;Slaves of Obsession&quot; had the feel of a soap box rather than a tale of intrigue.  I do not like Ms. Perry's obsession with placing twentieth century philosophy and social values in the nineteenth century--the characters' outlandish and grandiose future-reaching thoughts are misplaced and feel that way. Ms. Perry has the ability to weave a compelling story but this was not one of them. I look forward to her next William Monk adventure, but I hope that she will concentrate on the mystery rather than wasting pages on over-worked social issues.	2000-10-14

I don't want to be a nay-sayer, but this Francis tale did not meet my expectations based on his previous Francis books.  Maybe his talent has grown so much that we expect too much. ?   Francis' fans really look forward to his new books and I can hardley wait until the next one is on the market--especially after reading &quot;Shattered&quot; because I am really anxious to see a new Francis book hit the stand at his former standards. We try not to be too fickle, but hey, there are a lot of other authors out there.   I missed the inner workings of the main character such as the main character in &quot;Whip Hand.&quot;  One of the reasons that I like Francis' writing is that he makes his characters believable people, but the people in &quot;Shattered&quot; didn't quite make the grade--like the title, they were a bit shattered themselves.   The blatant innuendoes detracked from the story. They did not add anything to the story.  If forcing the main characters into relationships is an editor/publisher-requirement, then Francis needs to find new ones.  He writes well enough without senseless nonsense.  I don't think any of his fans enjoyed the manipulated relationship in &quot;Shattered.&quot;  There was no reason for the main character and his lady friend to find mutual attraction.  Who are we to judge a great story teller?   None of us write as well as Francis and I never will, but I suppose we, as the money spenders, do have some small right to express our opinions.  I'd like to see his next book called &quot;Greased Pockets&quot; and present us a book at his former standards to keep us spending our hard-earned money at his bookstand. Overall, I felt like I was reading a &quot;shell game.&quot;  Keeping tabs of the videotapes was like keeping track of a master shuffling a pea under cups.  ?   The ending felt like a Charles Dickens ending to me--that is, where a story could have been good, the ending just happened. Francis is not alone in this change of standard.  Ms. Lilian Jackson Braun has done the same to her fans on her last two books.  I still like to read both Braun and Francis.  I will keep trying to read them both, but I hope they renew our faith in their talented storytelling abilities. I generally cannot put down a Francis story.  I didn't feel the same attraction to &quot;Shattered.&quot;  I didn't put it down too much because I kept hoping it would get better.  It didn't.  I waded in the shallow water and was never put out to sea at all.	2000-09-27

Not terrific for science fiction and I really think the creatures at the end of the book were too silly.  The beginning of the book had promise, but it fell rather flat.  However, as an SG1 fan, I'd recommend it to another SG1 fan who isn't craving for very technical scifi.  The cover was great.	2000-05-03

I didn't think there was enough challenge for the team, but, hey, I am not the author.  OK for SG1 fans, but not very sci fi overall.	2000-05-03
