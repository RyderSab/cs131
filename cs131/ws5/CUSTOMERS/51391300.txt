I really diidn't pay attention to it (even though it's in my library) until I had lent a bunch of my logo resources to my best friend who was designing a business card for a client. She called me and went on and on about how much she loved Logo Power and how she never knew how she lived w/o the CD, etc. I didn't even know what book she was talking about until she returned everything and I was thinking, \\"this book?\\" I finally sat down and realized what it offered, and basically, it's a world of convenience. It is not the most impressive looking volume - even the cover is lame in my opinion - and there's not much excuse for a book on logos to look like doggy doo - but for some reason, the author had one person do the artwork on the CD and another person do the cover art.<br /><br />It hasn't gotten rave reviews - probably because the cover and content aren't exciting like most other books of the genre - this is like the office supply store for a corporate identity model. You don't run an office without pens, pencils, paperclips, etc... and even though the supplies are hardly all your office is made of, it's hard to run a productive office w/o supplies.<br /><br />If you're a freelancer and you need to develop logos, this is a book that needs to be in your reference library. It includes a CD-ROM for Mac & Windows that has templates to help you create a corporate identity manual - an essential element in a complete logo creation package for yourself or a client. The references are generic and no samples of real working logos exist, this is a how-to manual and it is right on the money. An excellent resource that no designer should be without.	2005-09-16

She is a tad judgmental if not very human as we all are. Sometimes, for no specific (or at least legitimate) reason, we find people in life we just don't care for and it's hard to always put on a poker face.<br /><br />Jean Thompson tells her students that she loves them all the same, but her behavior is quite transparent to everyone but herself. She finds one student in particular, Teddy Stallard, unkept, unattractive and frankly unlikable.<br /><br />When Christmas comes along, all the students bring presents to her and Teddy's is the most ugly and tackiest of all - a cheap perfume bottle and a cheesy bracelet with missing rhinestones - and it looks like a monkey wrapped them. Miss Thompson is very professional and politically correct, so when the students laugh at his gifts, she puts on the bracelet and dabs on some perfume.<br /><br />After class, Teddy talks to her about the gifts, revealing the sweet heart of gold beating in this unlikable boy. His revelation to her changes her, humbles her and enables her to be an unforgettable influence on Teddy's future life choices. A boy that could have easily grown up to be a loveless and self-absorbed thug is clearly changed by the attention and affection from his teacher and in the end, they heal each other in ways neither of them, especially Miss Thompson, can ever imagine.<br /><br />The book is short (a bit shorter than this review, I imagine!), but deep. It can be read once in just a couple of minutes, but will be read over and over again by any child. It's sweet, it's moving and it is moral. I can't say enough about how awesome this little book is for all children to have.<br /><br />Teddy's mother suffers a major illness and then dies and is left with an ineffectual father - so for real young children who may suddenly freak out with the possibility of losing a parent, this should be given to a  child with discretion - but like all books for youngsters, it's ideal for parents to read the books with their kids and talk about what they think about the story.for parents to read the books with their kids and talk about what they think about the story.	2005-09-14

The illustrator captures not only the breed, but the unique personality of the book's subject, Boodil. Like all terriers, she's playful, odd and opinionated. She calls the shots and while others who don't know Boodil may think she's disobedient or a bit dim, her owner knows different.<br /><br />A positive spin is put on all of her antics. She is a strong-willed child who is obviously deeply loved and appreciated, warts and all.<br /><br />The illustrations are so sweet and hilarious, you'll find yourself wondering if you shouldn't add a Bull Terrier to your family. The cute little pink highlights on the thin fur around her muzzle and belly are just to die for. Boodil is a good dog, and a good book.	2005-09-14

I had gotten this book under the mistaken premise that it was simply a primer on Yiddish, not knowing it was a parody of the old school readers. I was actually pleasantly surprised to find out it was both. I learned some Yiddish I have never heard before, all while reading a hilarious story of a goyim-looking family all schmoozing in Yiddish... Yinglish, actually. English with a little Yiddish peppered in here and there. The glossary in the back explains the terms in hilarious detail.<br /><br />One drama and shanda after another with the mishpoca! Bubbe gets ibbledick in the kippe, but this brings the family together for the tsimmes.<br /><br />This is not suitable for children as there are family members cheating on their spouses, a grandmother that has a stroke and goes to the hospital, etc. No one dies, but the theme is a bit mature for young readers.<br /><br />The illustrations are fantastic parodies of the 1950's style reader. To see all these blonde, blue-eyed happy folks wearing golf shirts, spewing Yiddish is too much! Whether you already know quite a bit of Yiddish, or you just know what you heard from Mike Meyers as Linda Richman on SNL, you're going to get a kick out of this little primer.	2005-08-29

He talks about his salary, his working conditions, his co-workers, fond memories and people he'd like to smack. The dirty tricks, the snide jabs and the few sweet folks that stood out.<br /><br />Mohr's not afraid to snip the jewels off some big-name players. At first, I thought this was a bitter, whiney rant, until he'd continue with the story... once you get the big picture, you kinda forget that you're hearing Jay tell you his story - but rather you feel like you're there, experiencing it yourself.<br /><br />He shares his most embarassing and regretful moment and he shares his triumphs. A few times, I caught myself smiling, remembering vividly a sketch I had forgotten, that Jay retold - and I caught myself laughing outloud a few times as well as I pictured the looney rants of some of his former co-stars.<br /><br />His dead-pan impersonations of Lorne Michaels and Adam Sandler were right on the money. After hearing him tell his story of plagiarism, my jaw clenched. I was torn between thinking he was gutsy for sharing it and thinking Michaels should have fired him on the spot for an obvious rip-off documented in full color.<br /><br />As someone who has recently been laid off from a decent paying job, but still making less than half what he made per season working only 20 weeks a year when I work 52 weeks a year was a bit grating. I know there's a cost of living issue in NYC, but come on! Tim Meadows is no fool - he's been raking in the big seniority bucks, and still had time to do a movie. I have been stressed at work, but it's hard to fathom throwing that sweet deal away... passing chances to be immortalized in DVD releases of the show, re-runs, etc... it's almost as cool as becoming an action figure.<br /><br />Despite my disgust with some of his attitudes toward his work, I found the audiobook to be straight and to the point and full of valuable insights not available elsewhere.ng an action figure. <br /> <br />Despite my disgust with some of his attitudes toward his work, I found the audiobook to be straight and to the point and full of valuable insights not available elsewhere.	2005-08-27

The linchpin to this international plot is Tyler Boxter, a Wall Street broker who is one of the few good guys who sees beyond the almighty dollar, but who also knows how to turn millions into billions. As he and his partner, former Federal Judge John Morgan, form the building blocks of a multi-billion-dollar empire, they believe they have crossed all \\"t\\"s and dotted all \\"i\\"s by keeping their plans as close to the vest as possible before the official unveiling. Even their trusted friends, members of the firm they built from the ground-up, have not been included in this scheme which is intended to not only make them all filthy rich, but to also make life better for the common man.<br /><br />Unknown to them, secret eyes are watching them in the wings, waiting to kill them. Are they just hired mercenaries from some company pushing industrial espionage to the next level, or do these cut-throat terrorists have more sinister plans in which Boxter and Morgan are just stepping stones?<br /><br />The story takes the reader across the world, literally, as each character travels from one square to another on the global chess board, stitching together a plan to take over the economies of the planet itself, destroying America along the way.<br /><br />Author Peter Thomas weaves together complex, but believable characters - described both physically and emotionally so you really care what is happening to them. Despite the fact that everything from prostitution to beheadings is touched on, Thomas manages to tell his story without foul language, without grotesque details that give you nightmares and without detailed sex scenes that make you want to bathe after reading. How refreshing!<br /><br />Just when you think you've figured what is going to happen next, the story twists and turns just like real life - and you don't know what's happening until it's over. Antagonists are hate-worthy and protagonists are not perfect, but heroic nonetheless. Thomas is a gifted writer and can write certain scenes in such a way that you feel like you are in the room with these characters.<br /><br />My less than perfect rating is for a number of reasons, but I think they all stem from one main problem - this book needed a professional editor to chisel off the rough edges.  Some of the economic, trade and health care concepts were way too detailed and over-explained, and made the story less than enjoyable. The concepts are explained, re-explained and then explained again in dialogue that sounds like an infomercial. An editor would have been instrumental in snipping these over-the-top explanations, as well as eliminating the typos. Each chapter has a scene change - citing a date and a time. Some of the time differences are really irrelevant or at least were lost on this reader. Most of these time notations would have been better as \\"later that evening\\" or \\"earlier that morning...\\" in my opinion. And finally, the over-use of $50-words - words that no one with even an above-average IQ  would use in a normal conversation. I had to consult a dictionary so many times, I simply stopped looking the words up because it stopped the natural flow of reading. I love an intelligently-written book such as \\"Den of the Assassin,\\" but it felt as though the words were thrown in because they were the most intelligent-sounding words found in a thesaurus.<br /><br />Despite these shortcomings, the book is well-worth the read and enduring the technical jargon regarding the financial markets. Once the story gets going, it is a page-turner.  Love, hate, anger, joy, jealousy, loyalty, celebration and grief - the novel takes you through about every emotion and experience you can imagine in a brief 400+ pages and does an excellent job at it.  The end of the book sets the reader up for expectations of a second novel. Just like life, things are not tied up in a neat little bow all the time. For his first novel, Thomas truly shines, I am already looking forward to reading his next book.he technical jargon regarding the financial markets. Once the story gets going, it is a page-turner.

Obviously, we come off that way to young kids and this book reinforces all the negatives and there are really no positives. This is a fun book for story time with your child, however - to laugh with them and to ask them what their perceptions are, etc. In every illustration, the child is either bored, annoyed, angry or disgusted with the bafoon adults who get to control everything. As an adult, I got a kick out of this page-turner - reminds you of how you thought of the adults in your life when you were a child and how we all end up growing up to be just what we used to loathe - tired, grumpy, controlling know-it-alls without patience.	2004-09-20

What better way to know what goes on in your child's mind during the day and to help them see positive things in every day all the time! Matthew tells his mother how he was awakened by elephants who have trumpet trunks and who were playing the Star Spangled Banner as his father drove him to school in a super-sonic car race. After he tells one elaborate tale after another, he realizes that the story he just told wasn't his favorite thing that day, after all - he keeps telling more about his day, filled with space men and fantastic creatures, that in the end, are well-behaved and friendly to him. He obviously has a great out-look on life.<br /><br />As he tells his Mommy about his adventures, he's clutching an adorable stuffed rabbit. In his adventure tales, the rabbit interacts with him and his friend Spencer. There are so many hidden treasures in the illustrations, which are absolutely precious. As Matthew continues his story, we see an elephant's trunk sticking out from under the bed, waving a checkered flag.<br /><br />The story is so sweet and is a wonderful tale of the bonding of a child and parent... that having his mom hang on his every word and participate in his story is in the end, his real favorite thing.	2004-09-20

Who would think that Elvira, Mistress of the Dark would write a children's book that you'd want to have in your home? Not me! But this book is awesome! That's right - Cassandra Peterson, one of the co-authors, is better known as Elvira.<br /><br />Co-author John Paragon has a pet Dalmatian named Andy, who was no doubt the driving force of inspiration for this hilarious book of few words, but non-stop laughs.<br /><br />Cathy Pavia's illustrations are to die for! Andy's expressions are priceless and if you've ever had a dog be naughty, you will understand everything that is going on.<br /><br />Andy's owner is going out to the grocery store and tells Andy to watch the house - but there is a naughty glint in Andy's eye. After the door shuts, Andy runs to the window to make sure the coast is clear, leaving a big nose smear on the glass.<br /><br />Andy has a brief \\"Risky Business\\" moment as he rifles through his master's dresser and dons his briefs and shades and slides into the livingroom. Andy gets into the garbage, smokes a cigar, pukes on the rug, has a female poodle come over to play and generally wreaks havok in the house.<br /><br />When he hears his daddy coming home, he has to clean up - and quick. If only real dogs cleaned the house!<br /><br />As Andy tears up his home - we can see photos of dogs, especially one of Andy on Santa's lap. We see statues of dogs, an Andy Warhol print on the wall (one would guess Andy is named after the artist - his hair is the same color, anyway!) and other clear homage to life with dogs.<br /><br />Life with dogs can be so rewarding and life with a Dalmatian is not for the faint of heart - but not without its own set of rewards. The authors clearly appreciate the fun spirit of dogs more than they disdain their naughty antics. A hoot for children and adults.	2004-09-01

The muddy colors of the illustrations are less than stimulating, but the pictures are pretty straight forward, as is the story. Everyone who eats will eventually poop - and depending on how big the person or animal is, the sizes, shapes and smells will be different. Poops ranging from bug poops to elephant poops are explored. Some animals clean up after themselves, some just let it land anywhere.<br /><br />The pooping little boy is a bit too graphic for my tastes - showing a poop coming out of a child sitting on the toilet is a bit much - and it's graphic enough that little girls are going to ask, \\"Mommy, what's that thing inbetween his legs?\\" (and I'm not talking about the poop).<br /><br />Kids are not going to be embarrassed about the illustrations as long as the adults aren't. This is a cute book to supplement potty training - showing kids going potty and animals going as well... making it a less imposing subject.<br /><br />The book isn't about potty training per se - rather just a brief walk through the land of pooping.	2004-08-09

One child asks, \\"Do you know about things before their [sic] invented?\\" The accompanying illustration (not by the child) shows clouds - one cloud has a TV in it, one has a radio.<br /><br />Another child writes, \\"In school we learned that Thomas A. Edison invented light, but in Sunday School, they said you did. I bet he stoled [sic] your idea!\\"<br /><br />Others are comical, but show the deep thoughts that are going on inbetween the ears of children, such as, \\"Instead of letting people die and then making new ones, why don't you just keep the ones you got?\\"<br /><br />My less than perfect rating is for the lack of information on the demographics of where they got these letters. Were they all in the US? Were they from one church or one synagogue? How many were collected in all? Also, the book is so thin - to really be a book that is read over and over - they needed to include more letters from more kids.	2004-08-09

Max says he likes the meat that his Papa buys at the store, but not the meat from animals he hunts, because \\"hunting is cruel and horrible.\\"<br /><br />Papa Wolf is mortified. On top of rejecting their way of life, this willful child has announced that he wants to be a florist when he grows up. He explains that from the profits from his flower shop, he will be able to buy all the food he needs so he won't need to hunt.<br /><br />Papa Wolf never punishes his son, but he does go through many trials trying to convince him that hunting is the vocation he should \\"choose.\\"<br /><br />Max has a room filled with stuffed animals - animals he should be hunting, but instead he prefers to play with them. He is not only tender-hearted, but he stands up for what he believes in.<br /><br />Papa Wolf is not happy with Max's ideals, but he copes with them in his own hilarious way.<br /><br />The illustrations by Martine Bourre are absolutely to die for! Max looks so angelic and his father looks so frustrated and huffy-puffy. Papa Wolf is depicted on one page as awake all night (Mama wolf is sleeping with curlers in her hair/fur) and Papa Wolf has this wide-eyed frustrated look in his eye. I laughed out loud when I saw these illustrations, and the story will captivate young and old readers alike.	2004-08-09

I agree with one reviewer who cited that there were too many witches, wizards and magic for her taste - however, those that were casting magic were pretty spiteful people. This is not glorifying magic or witchcraft. C.S. Lewis used a witch in his Narnia Chronicles as the embodiment of evil and personification of the Devil - he also used mythologicical creatures like &quot;fauns&quot; in his story, but I have never heard anyone being critical of Lewis's work being &quot;too full of magic.&quot;<br />This is a story that parents will want to read along with their children, and to explain the concepts therein.<br />The dog is a happy-go-lucky dog until he chases a car (driven by a poodle!) and gets lost in the woods and is taken in by a witch. His teeth itch, so he chews on her favorite broom and the evil witch (who smells like oatmeal) turns him into a German Shepherd (a real shepherd - in Germany). I am telling you, this story is creative and hilarious.<br />The story is short on length, but long on clever. Akin to a bookmarking ribbon, a cloth leash hangs from the spine of the book (because it's not really a book - it's a dog!) and the inside flaps are velvety so you can pet the book (er - dog).<br />A great asset for an aspiring illustrator or children's book writer to have on their bookshelf as well - I truly have never seen a book like this before. Extreme &quot;out of the box&quot; thinking went into this delightful book (dog).	2004-07-01

In a very subtle way, the book indicates that these are wild animals - no one pets the wombat... but food magically appears for him.<br />I literally laughed out loud while reading by myself. You could almost just reach right in the book and pinch the cheeks on that little fur ball.<br />Children (and adults) will love looking at the illustrations of the contented, sleeping wombat, as well as those that depict him as sometimes curious and innocently mischievious.<br />This is also a great way to introduce an animal that a lot of kids may never see (unless they live Down Under) in a zoo or even on TV, and a good way to open a discussion on how animals (wild animals, and even household pets) have their own unique personalities and different behaviors than people.	2004-06-27

Bernie Goldberg did something more brave than any of his contemporaries even fantasized about - he wrote factual editorial in the Wall Street Journal about liberal bias in the media. Doesn't sound like a big deal - conservatives scream liberal bias almost as often as liberals scream about &quot;right-wing&quot; bias... but unlike those who brought up the subject before, Bernie Goldberg was an insider - a correspondent on CBS news.<br />Not only was &quot;the Dan&quot; (Rather) so livid that he stated he would &quot;never&quot; forgive Goldberg for such a betrayal (for &quot;telling it like it is&quot;), his entire career (over a quarter of a century at CBS) was flushed down the toilet, with all the media elites fighting for the flush lever... with &quot;the Dan&quot; as head plumber.<br />The brass at CBS treating him like a Pariah and the media elites on the other networks, Jennings, Brokaw and others were vehemetly denying that they even had any political slant and claimed that Goldberg, himself a self-avowed liberal who claims to have never voted for a Republican in his life, had some long-standing Right-wing agenda.<br />Goldberg does more than just talk about his one editorial and the reaction, but cites article after article in  mainstream press in America and cites quote after quote from liberals and conservatives on Radio and TV and contrasts their statements with opposite equivalents to make those w/ a liberal slant wake up and smell the bias (if they dare).<br />Those who still deny a liberal bias after reading this book cover to cover are either lying, brain-dead or too stupid to know the difference.<br />Goldberg's book is an extremely witty, often funny, and clearly factual account of liberal bias among the media elites and the &quot;big 3&quot; networks. This should be required reading of all journalist/mass-media majors in college. Goldberg cites the ratings plunge of the network news programs year after year (the vast majority are going for cable options such as the more equally balanced FoxNews Channel) as a symptom of a long-ignored illness he first alluded to in his editorial - the public generally does not trust the main stream media.  Before they had no choice but to pick from CBS, NBC or ABC - now the choices are abundant - or as Goldberg would categorize it, &quot;sky's the limit.&quot;<br />Far from being a &quot;tell-all&quot; whine-fest of a disgruntled employee airing dirty laundry as a vendetta against his former task-masters, Goldberg speaks kindly of Rather on many respects, and seems to deal as fair handed as anyone could ask for in discussing what the puppet-masters at CBS, et al have been sweeping under their corporate rugs for years.<br />This is not only an easy, entertaining read, it's a must-read. If you read any non-fiction books this century, this should be the first one you grab - and don't let go until you've read it cover to cover!ws programs year after year (the vast majority are going for cable options such as the more equally balanced FoxNews Channel) as a symptom of a long-ignored illness he first alluded to in his editorial - the public generally does not trust the main stream media.

My high rating is for the superb studio photography and detail for each sample... but it loses a couple of stars on a number of fronts.  The only readers of this book will be people, but people poo is hardly covered in detail. Why not a number of shots of different colors, shapes and sizes, describing what causes the various colors in each sample?<br />Then, on common pets such as cats and dogs, why not a variety there, to help diagnose illness?<br />It would seem that the authors could not decide whether this would be a commentary, a compendium or a comedy.  The &quot;s-word&quot; and other colorful metaphors are used profusely for the sake of shock value, rather than for informative purposes. It's shocking to see such a nicely prepared volume with what appears to be such unprofessional language.  It's not funny enough to be funny and not serious enough to be taken seriously.<br />It is interesting to see droppings from giraffes, monkeys, etc., but some of the animals mentioned are animals I have never heard of - and no picture of the animal itself is displayed.<br />This unusually themed book had a lot more potential than was reached by the authors. This is NOT a book for children, due to the comments in the book, but for kids who can't read, it might be a hoot at story time.<br />For the aspiring yet-to-be-published writer, this will certainly be an inspiration - if this poo can be published, than the world is your oyster.	2004-03-18

I've heard numerous references to it through the years. Before killing John Lennon, Mark Chapman, who read and re-read the book many times - to the point of believing it was his own biography, asked Lennon to autograph his copy before gunning down the musician. John Hinckley, attempted assassin of Ronald Reagan, was another devotee of the short novel, as was Robert Bardo, killer of Rebecca Schaeffer (star of &quot;My Sister Sam&quot; on TV). There may be countless other criminals and stalkers who have identified with the book's main character, Holden Caulfield.  In Mel Gibson's movie, &quot;Conspiracy Theory,&quot; his character has an obsession with the book and must buy a copy every time he sees one.<br />I finally had to pick up a copy and find out what all the fuss was about. Was the book about stalking and murder? Not exactly - but rather the motivating factor behind such heinous crimes of obsession.<br />Caulfield, in his late teens, is a misfit in a world that doesn't tolerate misfits very well. His younger brother, who he dearly admired for being so likeable and genuine, has died of cancer. His older brother, D.B., lives in Hollywood, writing stories for the big screen, which is a loathsome thought for Caulfield.<br />Caulfield is an introspective youth who hates being around fake people (who doesn't?), but doesn't try to get to know people well enough to find out whether they are really phony or not. He stumbles through life with his arms crossed in defiance, believing he's one of the few genuine people in the world.<br />Growing up in an affluent home, being shuttled from one prep school to another, Caulfield finds himself ensconced with phonies and it makes him sick to his stomach. His refusal to acclimate results in him being kicked out of one school after another. The novel opens with his narrative of how he has been kicked out of Pencey, his latest prep school, and how he doesn't want to face his parents until they've gotten the news and calmed down a bit.<br />He heads up to New York, getting a room in a fleabag hotel, then running from bar to bar, trying to find something that won't bore him. He's obsessed with avoiding boredom at all costs.  He's constantly finding himself in situations where he fantasizes about killing people, but never defends himself because, he explains, he's &quot;yellow.&quot;<br />His inability to focus and attempt to express himself makes him frustrated and angry, finding contempt and hate for just about anyone for any reason, even those he loves.  The story takes the reader on a rollercoaster ride of 2 and a half days as Holden Caulfield searches for meaning in his life, but finds only emptiness. The only thing he can seem to hold onto is the fantasy of building a cabin out in the middle of nowhere, where he never has to be around phonies again... he'd rather be alone, than lonely in the midst of crowds of phony-baloneys.<br />After reading the book, it's easy to understand how such misfits as Hinckley, Bardo and Chapman used this book as their personal anthem and almost as a proxy, felt the need to act out in ways that Holden Caulfield was unable or unwilling to do. To the sane reader, Caulfield's character is a study in sadness and loneliness, not a character worth admiring - albeit his search for the truth in life is a noble cause.<br />The book doesn't condone or condemn Caulfield, but rather states Caulfield's thoughts as they come to him. The sane reader can't help but want to reassure Caulfield that this is part of growing up and everything is going to be ok, and wonder where such people were in the lives of the famous stalkers who never had anyone reach out to them and slap them with some reality.<br />As someone with ADHD, I found the book a fairly easy read. Parents should know that the book is wrought with foul language and sexually suggestive narratives. As a minor, Caulfield smokes, drinks and attempts to procure the services of a prostitute, among other things... so this is not light reading nor should this be the reading material of a young person not mature enough to separate fact from fiction. Salinger's writing style is interesting - detailed, yet quickly paced, and a good piece of literature as reference for the aspiring writer.ead.

With crude drawings, the author explains how we get gas and how sometimes we burp, sometimes we fart. The original version of this book was in Japanese, which in itself is amazing. While we Westerners may not talk about farting in polite society, the Japanese don't even talk about bathrooms in polite society. Some friends of mine are currently living in Japan while working their for their jobs. When they were looking for a place to live, the real estate agent would not show them the bathrooms - even a toilet is enough to make people blush in polite Japanese society! Imagine discussing gas! Children, however, have to learn that things are embarrassing - to them, it's all natural.<br />The illustrations are enough to inspire anyone who can doodle on a cocktail napkin that they can be a children's book illustrator. The illustrations are extremely crude and primitive.<br />The book only has a handful of pages, and all are humorous. There is no information about when it is impolite to fart, just a few smattering animals here and there. There are a lot more things they could have included to make the book entertaining to adults while still being appropriate for children.	2004-02-24

First impressions can really make the difference in any situation - including meal time.  Whether you're making a snack for your kids or having the boss and his family for dinner, you can spice up a meal before it starts by having a lovely napkin arrangement.<br />It used to be that napkin arrangements were common place at just about any non-fast food restaurant, but it has become a lost art form except for the ritziest of hotels and most expensive 5-star restaurants where a basket of bread sticks can run you fifty bucks.  Most restaurants just roll your utensils into a cloth napkin and have you set your own plate. Efficient, but not as elegant.<br />This tiny book only has 22 napkin folds, but they are more than enough. A color photo shows the arrangement, and detailed illustrations take you through each step in achieving the same pattern. From a design in which paper napkins are used as faux roses at a picnic to a crisp cotton swan on your plate, the designs are enough to get your guests (or even your family) talking about how creative and fun the meal is, before they even start eating.	2003-12-31

At first, Katie thinks they look like dots, but her grandmother tells her to stand further back to see the flowers and the people. Katie has a rich imagination. She steps back and not only can she see the flowers, she can smell them. She closes her eyes and she finds herself within the painting itself, interacting with Jean Monet, son of Claude Monet, who is one of the subjects in the painting.<br />Katie picks flowers for her grandmother and enters one painting after another, meeting different artists and interacting with the various subjects.  She is chased by bees that follow her into the museum, but her overall experience is one of adventure.<br />Katie and her grandmother are whimsical impressionistic drawings themselves, and in the museum are photos of the actual works of Monet, Renoir and Degas.<br />The book also tells readers the names and dates of the paintings and in what museums they are seen today.<br />This is not only a great book to introduce children into art, but also a great exercise for the imagination - picturing yourself escaping into a painting and meeting new people. It is a great book for parents to read to their kids or for children to read on their own.	2003-12-16

It is a short, but entertaining read for a child or for a parent to read to their children. The story is about Marie,  a young girl in France who is loved by her poor, but hard-working parents. They work long hours to save money to send her to ballet school - as it is her dream to become the world's most famous ballerina.<br />When her father becomes ill and can no longer afford to pay for her classes, the famous artist Edgar Degas offers to pay her for modeling for him. He is mean, short-tempered and impatient with Marie, making her hold poses for hours until her neck aches.<br />One night, however, she finds out just a little of what is under the surface of Degas' rough exterior and feels sorry for him, giving him her long hair ribbon.<br />Even her modeling pay cannot sustain the cost of her classes, so she must give up her dream. Later, she and her parents receive an invitation to a gallery showing of Degas' work - the center piece is the only sculpture of his ever displayed during his lifetime - it is of Marie - and unlike other statues, hers is wearing a tutu and the beautiful hair ribbon she gave him.<br />The story is not only entertaining, but it tells children that while some people may act mean or rude, it may be because they are hurting on the inside - and extending friendship to someone who behaves in such a manner can truly make a difference in their life and in yours.<br />The story is peppered with illustrations of Marie and her family, as well as photos of Degas' paintings and of course, his famous sculpture. Information about the names of the paintings and the museums where they are displayed is also cited at the end of the book.<br />This doesn't have to be just a book for girls - even young boys will see a universal truth - we can always have dreams and even though they may not come true the way we envisioned them, we never know what wonderful surprises are around the corner.	2003-12-15

Of course, Lindsey is not making his own predictions, but rather explaining the what, who, and where of names cited in the book of Daniel, etc. based on historical record.<br />My less than perfect rating is for the manner in which Lindsey and his co-author Carlson jump around from topic to topic within chapters. A number of places say something of the manner of &quot;if you'll remember from Chapter 8...&quot; which isn't possible since the chapters have names, but not numbers... so unless you're keeping a running tab of what chapter you're on, you're not exactly sure as to what the authors are referring to (unless you've got a mind like RainMan, of course).<br />The book makes no apologies for its matter-of-fact statements regarding the current state of the world and where we're headed ... and acts as a &quot;wake-up call&quot; for those who don't see the proverbial handwriting on the wall.<br />While written in 70s vernacular, the message of the text is as timeless as the books it refers to.  There is a reason why the New York Times listed this as the best seller for over a decade - it's a much read and re-read book on our times and the times to come.	2003-11-26

I thought I knew a lot of the slang referring to things normally covered by bathing suits, but I was mistaken. Tons of stuff I didn't even imagine. Some of the terms are 19th Century slang and are no longer used... and the reason for their use is not always obvious or explained.<br />The few sparse illustrations are absolutely hilarious, but they are just cartoons to pepper the book, not diagrams.<br />My less than perfect rating is due to the lack of true history behind the terms, especially those from the 1960s and earlier... just citing that it was coined in a particular year.<br />Also, there are terms I have heard repeatedly on TV &amp; movies that were not cited here. There are no references as to where they collected their data, so the book becomes more of a funny bathroom humor compendium instead of a reliable lexicon.<br />Whenever you need an arsenal of foul words, or you need to look up that term you just overheard your teenager say on the phone, however, this is a handy reference for those of us less informed in the realm of lockerroom banter.	2003-11-26

Some files were scanned in at 1200 dpi, others as low as 120 dpi.  The scans are extremely clean, but why not a consistent resolution for all? Why weren't these run through Adobe Streamline to make them vector based EPS drawings so that resolution wouldn't even be a factor?<br />There is an odd licensing agreement on the images - you can use up to 10 images in a given project, but any more than 10 requires written permission.  I suppose this is to protect the authors from someone taking the images and making their own clipart book.<br />A good artist can work around these failings with the proper skills and software as needed, however, and for the small amount of shelf space it occupies, it is a real treasure trove of fine-quality clipart.	2003-11-23

No more simple fold and tape packages or just a quick gift bag for a special gift. When you want to give a memorable gift to someone special, this book shows the many easy and fun ways you can present the gift with true flair and style... and a touch of whimsy.<br />There are extremely simple techniques for those of us with two left hands.. how to measure and cut paper before we wrap and how to properly wrap square and round (yes, round!) boxes and even unusually shaped items.<br />Trimming variations from ribbon, cord, rope and twine are explored.<br />Some useful templates are included that you can trace, photocopy or scan into your computer to enlarge or shrink as needed so you can really have fun.<br />You may never think of stencils or rubber stamps the same way again - Sally Walton shows you how to use what could be tacky into something stylish and very chic.<br />Several photographs showing each step and the final presentation are provided for each project - not only allowing you to follow the design step-by-step, but even a chance to add your own creative touches and modify the author's designs.<br />Many of the techniques can be done by anyone, but a few may have the less than crafty a little overwhelmed, yet still inspired.<br />Unless you are a craft maniac, these may not be projects you want to do for Christmas, where you are wrapping dozens of gifts in a unique way - but for birthdays, retirements and Valentine's day, these are unique projects that really bring home the fact that you are giving a gift from the heart and not something you ran to get at Walgreens at 2am.<br />There are styles from the ultra-feminine, to the sophisticatedly masculine, to the modern and very artsy.<br />Your gift recipients will not be ripping the wrappings off that fast when they get a gift wrapped with such thoughtfulness... they will ponder the detail put in every facet of the work.<br />You no longer have to pay homage to the commercial package-wrapping machine - you can now get a big plastic bin and fill it with a glue gun and different fun craft items and just pull it out each time you need to wrap something for someone special. You don't have separate rolls of &quot;happy birthday&quot; paper, &quot;Happy Holidays&quot; paper and other themed rolls... instead you can have textured boards and butcher paper and add your own creative touches without spending an $5 on just enough paper to wrap one gift.

The illustrations look deceptively simple and boring. Once you really sit down and pour over the pages, however, you really start to absorb how useful these layouts are.<br />Mixing and matching the components will guarantee that you will never have another boring brochure or newsletter. The designs can also get your brain churning in the direction of a better logo design and a definite help in business card design.<br />The book's stiff spine and short page width means page turning requires two hands and you can't lay this book flat to study designs - a definite failing in a book of this type. In spite of this, it is still an essential to have in your creative library.	2003-11-22

You will most likely need to go to a specialty store to get some of the spices or other ingredients for your spice rack. One of the reasons Indian food is so incredibly unique in flavor is due to the use of non-Western spices and combinations of ingredients that are truly foreign (pardon the pun) to most westerners.<br />My less than perfect rating is due to the fact there are several crucial recipies that are absent. No instruction on how to make mint or tamarind chutney - the mainstays of any and every table at an Indian restaurant. Also no information on papads (lentil wafers) or my favorite dish, Aloo Bengan (a potato and eggplant dish).<br />Despite these missing items, there will be no boring meals when you follow the recipies in this book.  I have prepared Indian dishes in lieu of traditional turkey and ham during Thanksgiving and Christmas for my family and have received nothing but praise and awe. I am not domestic and don't care for cooking, but when I am preparing a lot of dishes, I want to reap a lot of benefit for my efforts and this book doesn't let you down.	2003-11-22

You don't have to have any musical training to follow the instructions, which assume you are new to even reading sheet music.<br />A brief intro to the history of the whistle is explained and a couple of photos of the proper way to hold the whistle while playing. The musical staff is introduced to the neophyte ins easy-to-understand terms, including the length of time to play/hold each note or rest.<br />First some exercises, followed by an easy-to-play song, then a more challenging exercise, followed by another song.<br />After a few pages of introduction, the authors supply page after page of music for you to play.<br />At the end of the book are some &quot;next steps&quot; to take if you want to expand your horizons... including tunings for guitars and ukuleles.

No love, just self-affirmation and a perpetuation of the feeling of entitlement that this &quot;lost&quot; generation is so often encouraged to foster.<br />The book does have some valuable, useful information, but it is in many ways in a vacuum... peppered with photos of pop icons does not make this a warm, fuzzy guide and it can be coma-inducing if you try to read it cover to cover.	2003-11-22

Unlike its predecessor, this book does not include a Hebrew index or even the vowels. Also unlike the earlier edition, there is no expanded section on how to pronounce the letters and letter combinations and there are no references to the script/cursive letters - only the block/printed letters. People in Israel do not write in block - they write in script. The script looks nothing like the block in most cases, so if someone writes you a note in Hebrew, it might as well be in cuneiform, because you won't be able to decipher it with this book!<br />This book does add some fun features - some exploded drawings of a car and a motorcycle, with Hebrew names for all parts of a car (brake pads, clutch, gasket, etc.)... but if you are just travelling to Israel, is this information you're ever going to need?<br />There is a truncated section on feminine numbers, but not on masculine numbers - the complete opposite of what they did in the previous edition.<br />While the book is color coded by section, the Hebrew labels for these sections are no longer present, and without even a Hebrew index, a confused traveller can't even hand the book to an Israeli to ask for help when communicating.<br />Why Berlitz would do this is beyond me - they had already done all the hard work in the earlier edition and only needed to add the few missing items in the new edition - but instead stripped it down into a flashier, yet useless shell of its previous existence.<br />There are worse books to get, but why get this one when you can have a much more useful book by getting a slightly older model.<br />This newer edition has a few extra &quot;modern&quot; words like &quot;e-mail,&quot; but the additions are few and far between and as a whole, this newer edition borders on useless because of the critical pieces that are missing.	2003-11-21

Berlitz is well known for their language books, audio tapes, and their pocket phrase books. Some of their books are good, some are only so-so... and unless you already have some working knowledge in the language you're interested in, you may not realize a book is mediocre until it's too late.<br />Berlitz has  a newer version of this phrase book that is not up to par with this slightly older model. The newer version does not have the vowels or as extensive of a reference section. I do not know why a newer edition would have less useful information, but it does... so make sure you get this one - with ISBN #283150872X in lieu of its newer companion .<br />Unlike so many other phrase books for Hebrew, this one has the vowels and detailed explainations on how to pronounce the letters. There are easy-to-read samples of block and script letters and the crisp black ink on the stark white pages makes the characters easy to read.<br />The book is color coded by section with labels such as &quot;Hotel,&quot; &quot;Making Friends,&quot; and &quot;Eating Out&quot; and the sections are labeled in English AND Hebrew. There is also a Hebrew index in addition to the English one, so a confused traveller can hand the book to a native speaker to help them find the right word.<br />My less than perfect rating is due to the lack of information on feminine numbers. There are masculine &amp; feminine numbers in Hebrew and the feminine numbers are used to tell time and for math. The reference section has some great information, including all the masculine numbers, but there is no section on how to tell the time or how to count money and the existence of feminine numbers is not even suggested since the masculine numbers aren't even listed as being masculine - just &quot;numbers.&quot; Many other languages do not have gender-based numbers, so a neophyte to the language could be in a pickle. A native speaker would understand them, since the numbers sound similar, but someone depending on this book to learn the language won't understand when someone tells them the time.<br />Even with the few failings, considering the size of this book, there is a tremendous bounty of information crammed in there and if you're only going to take one book with you on the plane to Israel, this might as well be it. It's a great reference to have with you as you travel through the Holy Land.is book to learn the language won't understand when someone tells them the time.<br />Even with the few failings, considering the size of this book, there is a tremendous bounty of information crammed in there and if you're only going to take one book with you on the plane to Israel, this might as well be it.

They usually have rich, clear photos and are easy to follow. This Hebrew Phrase Book does not follow the form of the typical DK book. There are no photos or even illustrations in the book.<br />A person well versed in Hebrew doesn't need this book and a complete neophyte to the language will have a hard time navigating this book in an emergency. Sections are labeled in English-only, so a traveller to Israel cannot hand the book to an Israeli to help them communicate.<br />There are no vowel pointings anywhere, just the consonants. While there is English transliteration, there is no mechanism for someone to truly learn to read Hebrew from this book, only to continually use it as a crutch.<br />The feminine numbers are listed, but the masculine numbers are not... a good way to embarrass yourself if you use the wrong gendered numbers.<br />The book gives the impression to the non-initiated that it will help you in any situation, but it is not realistic. There are words for \\"heart attack,\\" \\"German Measles,\\" \\"hemorrhage,\\" and \\"pneumonia,\\" among others. If you are sick enough to need these words, do you really think you will have the energy to look it up in this ridiculous phrase book?<br />The hospitals in Israel are very modern and very westernized and most of the medical staff have at the very least some English skills and they can always get a fluent English-speaking nurse and/or doctor to answer your questions and to explain treatement, etc.<br />Most of this medical stuff is just fluff to make you think the book supplies all of your needs, but to work the way it implies it should, the book should be color-coded and have Hebrew & English headings, as well as an index in Hebrew.<br />The book has a plethora of information, but it is not designed in such a way to maximize a newbie's absorption of a new language.  If you already have basic Hebrew under your belt (Modern Hebrew, not just something you vaguely recall from your Bar Mitzvah), this book can be of some help when you're looking for one or two words that have either slipped your memory or that you're unaware of... but this book will not help you if you're trying to do anything other than to blurt out a phrase - there is no way you're going to really understand a response unless the speaker says it in the same exact word order (and the same exact words) as appears in the book.  Those planning more than just a site-seeing trip to Israel should really invest in Pinsleur's Hebrew audio course instead (also sold here on Amazon).

Recipes like the Mushroom Pecan Paté, however, make the book worth its weight in mushrooms.<br />The book has dozens of scrumptious recipes for different mushroom varieties... quite a bit is jammed into this tiny book.<br />I have two major gripes, however, that reduce this book to a 4-star review. While the die-cut shape of the book is whimsical, the pages are not easy to turn and the book will not lay flat. While there is a colorful illustration of different mushroom varieties on the front cover, there are only scant drawings of different mushrooms throughout the book and the drawings are not labeled and are more for aesthetic purposes and do not denote that these are the mushrooms for the recipe at hand. Unless you are a bonafide chef (in which case you probably wouldn't need this book) and go to specialty stores, most people will not run across these mushrooms at the local supermarket. Mushrooms don't have a very long shelf-life and unless you get them dried or know of a market that specializes in mushroom varieties, most of these species will be unheard of and mysterious.<br />If you don't  live next to a &quot;Central Market&quot; or other specialty store that carries a variety of mushrooms, you'll be out of luck identifying some of the varieties covered here, but if you have experience w/ many varieties of mushrooms, but haven't been too successful in bringing out their flavor, this book will be just the help you needed.	2003-11-16

I'm not into cookies, but I am definitely a Star Wars fan. The book was published in 1998, so there are no references to the prequel trilogy.<br />The book has a deceptive flat spine on the outside, but the inside is spiral bound so the book can lay flat on your counter - a must in any cookbook.<br />The book only has 29 recipes, but it is presented well. It has lots of full color photos revealing the final product - what your food should look like when you're done, and peppered in with various Star Wars action figures.<br />Despite its title, this is not a cookbook for just desserts - there are only 7 dessert recipes in the book. Some recipies are basic, where only the names are clever... such as &quot;Hoth Chocolate&quot; (which is just hot chocolate) and &quot;Han Burgers&quot; (which are juts plain ol' hamburgers) with a few visual puns such as the &quot;Twin Sun Toast&quot; and the &quot;R2-D2 Treats.&quot;<br />For finicky kids who like Star Wars but typically just poke at their food, having an official Star Wars recipe may be just the thing to convince them to eat. The clever names will make you sound like a genius when you whip up some snacks to bring to work or have a party for other Star Wars fans.<br />The last page has some foil stickers for you to put on packages you may prepare for family or friends with such clever lines as &quot;Use the Fork, Luke&quot; and &quot;Give in to your dark cravings,&quot; these are a cute addition.<br />It would have been nice for the author to have included either physical or web addresses for places to get Star Wars themed party supplies. Everything to R2-D2 cookie-cutters to paper table cloths, etc. I have seen these items and know they exist. Having a supply list like that would have been a nice addition to the book, as would have been stickers on a surface that is easier to write on. The foil/metalic stickers do not hold ink very well and smudge - and there are only a few stickers to begin with.<br />Overall, it's a fun book and a conversation starter to be sure. A good edition to add to your kitchen's reference shelf, or even as a coffee table book, this cookbook  adds some creative flair to ordinary recipes.a few stickers to begin with.<br />Overall, it's a fun book and a conversation starter to be sure.

For those new to the Pimsleur method, you may wonder how or why this audio course is superior to all others. The late Dr. Pimsleur studied intervals of repetition with students learning new languages... rote repetition over and over doesn't always sear new vocabulary and syntax into the brain - but Dr. Pimsleur discovered that repeating certain words and phrases in specific time intervals while learning other new things inbetween the intervals seemed to be the right method for training your brain to think in a new language.<br />American English is my native language and I didn't grow up hearing Hebrew or any other language at home. I was a late talker and have always had problems discerning sounds, despite my accute hearing. I didn't think an audio course would be worth my while.<br />All the Pimsleur programs start out the same way - a brief introduction - then you will hear an announcer speak in English, introducing a male and female native speaker of the language. At the beginning of lesson I, you first hear a brief conversation in Hebrew. If like me,  you have had no prior foundation in the language, it might as well be gibberish. Then the announcer tells you that at the end of just that 30 minute lesson, you will understand the entire conversation you just heard - and they are not kidding.<br />I hope that everyone who uses this program will contact Simon &amp; Schuster (the publishers) and beg them to come out with Hebrew II and Hebrew III like they have for Spanish, German &amp; French.<br />I didn't study with these endlessly - I just had the lessons in the car and when I'd go to lunch during the work day, I'd listen to one lesson in my car. As the lessons progress, they get increasingly more challenging, so I had to listen to some lessons more than once.<br />After listening several times to all the lessons through the last lesson, lesson #30, I felt confident that I could go to Israel, order food and drinks, ask for directions to the Western Wall or a hotel, have someone fill up my gas tank and even visit with new friends, etc. - all in modern Israeli Hebrew.<br />I listened to the CD lessons for a few months before enrolling in a Hebrew class in college (which I am still taking) - after 2 months of studying in college, there are very few new words that I've learned in class that weren't already covered in my lessons.<br />Hearing native speakers speak the language is essential - you get the intonation drilled into your head, which really helps you to speak it with the right accents in the right place and gives you more of a feeling for the language. The announcer explains important things about Israeli culture when necessary and as needed, will explain that a particular verb or other grammatical element is different in some instances (all languages have &quot;irregulars&quot;) and why that's the case.<br />This is like having an Ulpan-to-go. Granted, you won't be ready to run for the Knesset after mastering all 30 lessons, but you will be extremely confident in being able to conduct business and basic conversations in Hebrew. I took Spanish in High School and I feel like I have a much more comprehensive  mastery of Hebrew in a couple of months than I ever had in Spanish after 2 years of classroom training.el, have someone fill up my gas tank and even visit with new friends, etc. - all in modern Israeli Hebrew.<br />I listened to the CD lessons for a few months before enrolling in a Hebrew class in college (which I am still taking) - after 2 months of studying in college, there are very few new words that I've learned in class that weren't already covered in my lessons.<br />Hearing native speakers speak the language is essential - you get the intonation drilled into your head, which really helps you to speak it with the right accents in the right place and gives you more of a feeling for the language.

The Hebrew is pointed and contains all vowels - which is really required for a reference that has an audience of those new to the language.  The Hebrew is pointed in both halves of the book, so English readers needing to look up a Hebrew word to find its English definition will find it that much faster.<br />This book is not perfect... it says it is &quot;Up-to-Date&quot; but doesn't include such words as &quot;SPAM,&quot; &quot;Internet,&quot; or &quot;e-mail.&quot; Considering the limited offering of such dictionaries, however, this one stands out as one of the best (so far).	2003-04-07

Just sitting on my shelf, the acid from the paper has burned into the cardstock cover, leaving yellowish brown stains.<br />The printed ink is not even a true black... but rather a faded dark grey that looks like a photocopy of a photocopy.<br />Because there are no crisp edges of the printed characters, it is difficult to tell a Hebrew \\"pe\\" from a \\"phe\\" and distinguishing a \\"gimel\\" from a \\"nun\\" is almost impossible. The differences in these characters are subtle in the printed form and having obscure/fuzzy printing makes it that much more troublesome to read.<br />Reading the English text is not problematic, mostly due to the thin, serif font used for the English. The thick calligraphic style of the Hebrew, however, leaves no room for error.<br />My buying advice is to instead get the \\"Shimon Zilberman Compact Up-To-Date English-Hebrew/Hebrew-English Dictionary\\" (ISBN: 9652227781) which is also available here at Amazon.com.

I am so grateful that I didn't wait until I was on a plane on my way to Israel to listen to this. If you are looking for the fast track to learning Hebrew by listening, you need to get the Pimsleur Quick & Easy Hebrew CD set - it is so superior, it shouldn't even be in the same category with this CD.<br />Even though I've been studying Hebrew for almost a month, I couldn't understand what the people on this CD were saying. For a beginning CD, they speak way too fast and they don't repeat anything.<br />At the beginning of lesson one, the narrator says that you \\"can\\" follow along with the book \\"if you want\\"... without the book, it's impossible to understand what is going on - they talk way too fast, probably an attempt to fit all of this on one CD.<br />There may be some people who are naturally gifted in acquiring new languages just by listening (and such people are rare) who might actually pick something up from this CD.<br />The narrator says a word or phrase in English and then a \\"native speaker\\" says the Hebrew counterpart in super-sonic speed. Unlike English, most languages, including Hebrew, have feminine and masculine forms of nouns... and Hebrew has masculine & feminine verbs as well. The book shows both the feminine and masculine forms of the words being said, but with minimal exception, only one form is pronounced  on the CD.<br />The words in the book are transliterated for English speaking readers, but there is no Hebrew written out so that someone new to Israel could recognize something printed on a sign. Granted, most signs in Israel, especially in tourist areas, are in Hebrew and English.<br />Having already studied Hebrew for a few weeks, this CD is still impossible to utilize - I can't imagine the cursing that must go on on airplanes as people pop this CD into their CD player or laptop computer when they are at 30,000 feet, en route to Israel.<br />The beginning of the CD also makes a cocky statement - that after listening to the entire CD, you will be able to speak and understand basic Hebrew.  If languages were so easy to acquire, everyone would be learning new languages every week.<br />For someone who is visually impaired and wanting to learn via audio, this is not the way to go - the printed book is truly essential to follow along.<br />If you want to learn Hebrew for personal enrichment, Bible study, or to communicate with family in Israel, I highly recommend Pimsleur, \\"Alef-Bet for Adults,\\" and \\"Hugo Language Course: Hebrew In Three Months\\", all available on here at Amazon.com.<br />Even though the Pimsleur course was not intended to be absorbed during one flight, taking the Pimsleur course with you on your flight will be much more prudent than this \\"In-Flight Hebrew\\" CD. Obviously, if you start studying before your flight, you'll be that much better off.<br />Buying advice in a nutshell: don't!l be able to speak and understand basic Hebrew.

US	51391300	R3U8PNS6TJNUXO	0764551566	155489965	Aquariums For Dummies	Books	1	78	81	N	N	Fast track to killing fish and getting burned out	Too many inaccuracies to mention them all, but I will cite a few that stood out to me and how a beginning aquarist can find themselves burned out from this hobby after spending lots of money on equipment and fish only to see them die because they followed advice/assumptions made by this book.<br />The book tries to cover freshwater, brackish and marine (saltwater) aquariums simultaneously, but seems to be more focused on freshwater than anything else. I am a saltwater aquarist and I know very little about brackish or freshwater fishkeeping, but based on the misinformation on saltwater aquariums and fish, I would never follow any advice from this book - while there are many true/factual statements, I am not willing to roll the dice to see which ones are correct or incorrect.<br />There is a color photo of a yellow-bellied damselfish in the book w/ the caption \\"Fiji Blue Devil.\\" Blue Devils, aka \\"Blue Damsels\\" are intense blue all over and do not have yellow scales. The text concerning blue devils say that they are just called 'devils' but don't act that way. That is simply untrue. I've had 3 blue devils and and each one behaved wonderfully until they went through their growth spurt. They became very aggressive and bit fins and scales off of other fish. Full adults don't get any bigger than an adult's thumb, but they can harass and irreperably damage other fish, stressing them out and shortening their lives. Blue devils are beautiful fish and very inexpensive - but not worth it if they are destroying your other fish. There is a saying in the aquarium trade - \\"if damsels were as big as sharks, sharks would hide behind rocks.\\" Not all damsels are that aggressive. Some like the yellow tailed damsel can get along very peacably with other inhabitants. This misinformation in just a couple of paragraphs can cost you a lot of heartache and money.<br />There is also a mention of a Green Mandarin Goby and a photo of one... just stating that it's a beautiful fish. Mandarins (green or spotted variety) should NEVER be bought by beginners. In my opinion, they are one of the most beautiful fish in the trade, but 99% of the time, they die of starvation within 7 days of purchase. They are slow fish and they do not eat prepared foods. They eat bristle worms  and other very tiny lifeforms that live in the substrate (they are bottom feeders). These fish are not only beautful, but expensive.  I made these mistakes the hard way, following the advice of salespeople in aquarium stores who care more about getting your money than the welfare of your pets. A book that is supposed to be for beginners should not repeat the same misinformation.<br />One of the foods they cite as good for marine fish is brine shrimp. This is only partially true. Brine shrimp are appetizing to fish, but have almost no nutrional value by themselves. Hobbyists should only get spirulina-enriched brine shrimp instead of brine shrip alone - and this is not mentioned.<br />The information on live food is too brief and misleading. Live feeder guppies (freshwater) should NEVER be fed to marine fish... how would marine fish ever encounter fresh waterfish in the wild?! Freshwater fish are too fatty and too much feeding of freshwater fish to marine animals will lead to fatty liver disease which results in death. This is not mentioned. Also not mentioned is that feeding live food will increase the hunting instincts of your fish and make them more aggressive towards each other. Keeping your fish on prepared/frozen foods in lieu of live is the way to go.<br />The authors also say that you can periodically give your fish strips of cooked lean meat and potatoes. What!?!?! Find me a fish that can hunt down a cow and dig up a potato and cook them both - and I'll change my level of disgust with this information. Just because a particular species of fish might be an omnivore does not mean that ANY type of meat will suffice. This also gives the impression that cooked shrimp could be given. No oneshould be cooking for their fish. Fish eat aquatic plants and/or animals and fish do not cook. They also do not eat land mammals or spuds. Cooked foods such as these will also greatly foul the water.<br />The chapter on water sources doesn't even mention Reverse Osmosis or Deionization. Their advice is to get the \\"inexpensive\\" bottled water. Even cheap bottled water can get pricey when you're talking about filling up a 55 gal tank, not to mention water changes each month. A one time cost of getting an RO or RO/DI filter can make water cost you about 6 cents a gallon instead of paying upwards of a dollar a gallon.<br />More than half of new aquarists get out of the hobby within the first year because they blow too much money on garbage because they followed really bad advice and suffered through dying fish, algae blooms and bad pumps & filters. There are some good aquarium books out there, but this is surely not one of them.should be cooking for their fish. Fish eat aquatic plants and/or animals and fish do not cook.

Information specifically concerning the attacks and people involved is also covered.<br />The appendices at the back of the book cite various books, magazines and web sites for additional information that is sound and not exaggerated.<br />The book is presented in a scholarly format and is not an emotional diatribe.<br />The book is less than 160 pages including the appendix, index and table of contents - so it's fairly brief and to the point. If you're interested in learning more about Islam and you want to get accurate information, not some biased emotional tome, I highly recommend this book.	2002-05-09

The photos are really poor quality, but they show enough to get the point across. The Author, Raquel Thiebes, tells you in plain English what will happen before, during and after Basic Training (Basic).<br />After September 11, 2001, I felt frustrated that I was too old to join the military... but then I found out I was wrong and I can still get into the Army National Guard up until my 35th birthday.  I already knew that I'd have to lose quite a bit of weight and get into good shape, but I still had so many questions... what will I really be getting into if I decide to enlist?<br />The author thoroughly examines each step along the way... things you should be able to physically, memorize and understand BEFORE showing up at Basic.<br />As a woman, I found it frustrating to find other books on the subject omitting information about what it's like to be a female recruit. This book has quotes from different recruits and officers, both male and female... quotes on everything to how to prepare before Basic to how they think gender integration affects training.<br />An included chart tells you how many sit-ups &amp; push-ups you'll need to do, as well as a minimum speed for a 2-mile run... for both males and females, and per different age ranges. Recruits in Basic will range from 17 year olds to 35 year olds... the Army is realistic in knowing at 35 year old body is not as fast or as energetic as a 17 year old one.<br />It was comforting to know that the Army wants you to succeed and while they yell at you and make you sweat your butt off, they emphasize teamwork, loyalty and selfless service.<br />I still have a long way to go before I'm physically ready to enlist, but after reading this book, I feel much more confident and definitely ready and less intimidated. I know that no book or person can totally prepare me or anyone else for the challenges in the Army, but I do feel far more at ease about my decision to join.<br />The author clearly not only relied on her personal experiences, but also on research and interviews with current and former recruits, sergeants and officers. She includes a number of websites for reference as well as her own and invites those with additional questions to e-mail her directly.<br />Whether you've already enlisted or if you're just thinking about it, you owe it to yourself to read this book. As I was pondering my decision, I asked 2 male friends of mine who had been in the Army about their experiences... they both told me what they knew and what their experiences were, but I still felt like I wasn't getting the whole picture... this book makes me feel like I do have the big picture.<br />As more people join the military in response to 9/11 and demand for this book increases, I hope the author includes even more information in the next edition... including diagrams of how to perform certain exercises and how to salute, wear different types of uniforms, etc. ... and an index!  Nonetheless, this is a five-star effort and a tremendous resource I will definitely consult again in the future as I get closer to my fitness goals before enlisting.arly not only relied on her personal experiences, but also on research and interviews with current and former recruits, sergeants and officers.

It is very distracting, but just one of the problems I had with this highly over-priced book.<br />Remember when you had to write a term paper in middle school and you set your typewriter (or word processing program) to 2.5 spacing instead of just regular double-spacing and added 3 spaces instead of just 2 at the end of periods just to make the 10-page minimum required? That's how this book is written. The text is large, every paragraph is indented and it looks like each line was double-spaced... making the book 144 pages long instead of the obviously much shorter length it would be if it wasn't written like a kid's book report... of course, if it was only a 50 or so page book, they'd have a harder time selling it for twenty bucks.<br />Each chapter has a summary, which seems like another overt method of bloating the book's volume. Considering the brevity of the chapters, the summaries are ridiculously unnecessary.<br />The title of the book, &quot;The Real Insider's Guide to Military Training&quot; misleads the reader that you're going to get information not attainable elsewhere... this is simply not the case. The same information is repeated many, many times throughout the book. A book this small does not need the statement &quot;you get free room and meals&quot; repeated 20 times... everyone on the planet knows that you do not pay to eat when you're in training... it's one thing to cite some of these types of statements once, but to do so over and over again is just a waste of paper.<br />There is really only one chapter (albeit the largest one) that actually covers basic training, and it is less than 50 pages.<br />The title is also misleading in that it implies that it's an insider's guide to Military Basic Training... it is instead only a glimpse of Army Basic Training. The author states (several times, I might add) that Navy and Air Force training is probably different, but he did not state how. He also said that while Marine Basic Training would be very similar to Army Basic in some ways that it also differed in many ways, but the author obviously never investigated the differences in the branches and therefore gave a misleading title to his book as &quot;military&quot; implies all branches.<br />There is no index, but if there was one, there would probably only need to be 20 or so entries, each entry with 20 page references... there is that much repetition.<br />There is no mention of the differences between women and men in regards to number of push-ups, sit-ups, miles, etc. There is a lot of simple, basic info that I've read on web sites that is not in this book.<br />If the repetitions were removed, the lines single-spaced and the text proofed by a good editor, this could easily be condensed into an inexpensive booklet for potential Army recruits that I would probably recommend... but as-is, this book is a big loser.<br />It would have been nice (if not expected) for a book of this description (and price) to have drawings (if not photos) of rank insignia, proper saluting, locker set-ups, correct methods of doing push-ups and sit-ups (for both male and female), etc... but there are no drawings or photos in this book.... everyone on the planet knows that you do not pay to eat when you're in training... it's one thing to cite some of these types of statements once, but to do so over and over again is just a waste of paper.<br />There is really only one chapter (albeit the largest one) that actually covers basic training, and it is less than 50 pages.<br />The title is also misleading in that it implies that it's an insider's guide to Military Basic Training... it is instead only a glimpse of Army Basic Training.

Lewis in the 3rd grade when our home room teacher read the Chronicles of Narnia to our class.  I recently re-read the books as an adult and enjoy them just as much as I did then. I really like Lewis's style of writing and I've read other works by him such as &quot;The Screwtape Letters&quot; and &quot;The Great Divorce.&quot;<br />If you're looking for more stories by Lewis, be them in any form, this is a very interesting volume to have in your library, but it may leave you feeling a bit empty if you're longing for more soul-penetrating stories that teach you about yourself.<br />&quot;The Dark Tower&quot; is incomplete, but a vivid and highly interesting tale of the use of an imaginary device - a Chronoscope - that lets you view an other time the way you would view a star with a telescope. Lewis himself is in the story as one of a group of friends/scholars who meet to watch the happenings of the Dark Tower in the &quot;Othertime.&quot;<br />The story is intense and riveting and I couldn't put it down, but there are pages missing in the middle of the manuscript supposedly discovered after Lewis's death as a newly discovered, previously unpublished work. The end of the short story is also absent... and there is no indication of how close to the end the reader is to the ending when the story is cut off literally in mid sentence. The positive thing is that the story is so well written, it will keep your mind reeling as to the outcome and fate of the characters involved.  I've heard that the claims that this is an actual true work of C.S. Lewis is now being disputed, but if it is not of his hand, it sure reads like his style.<br />&quot;The Man Born Blind&quot; is an interesting account of a man born blind who gets his sight as an older adult and struggles with visual concepts such as &quot;what is light.&quot; It's a very short story and if any of the stories in this volume are to be disputed, this one would be my pick... it doesn't read like Lewis and I think Lewis was far more observant of human nature and of his environment in general to have made some of the assumptions he did in this very short story.<br />&quot;The Shoddy Lands&quot; is pure Lewis... almost like &quot;The Great Divorce,&quot; but in miniature. Very interesting explaination at the end that wasn't exactly what I was reading into it at first... a very good story.<br />&quot;Ministering Angels&quot; is not at all what you think it's about... but nonetheless an interesting futuristic tale of life on a human-colonized Mars. Also a very short story, but it's amazing how Lewis can depict a character so richly and vividly in just a few lines.is and I think Lewis was far more observant of human nature and of his environment in general to have made some of the assumptions he did in this very short story.<br />&quot;The Shoddy Lands&quot; is pure Lewis... almost like &quot;The Great Divorce,&quot; but in miniature.

On the flip-side, some things you might just think are junk could really be treasures after all.<br />Readers should keep in mind that this is a price guide, not a price rule. In other words, an item is only worth what people are willing to pay for it. An item may be listed as having a value of $400 (for example), but you may be hard-pressed to find a buyer (even on an on-line auction) who is willing to pay more than $50.<br />Kovel's is a pretty awesome guide as long as you keep that in mind. A price guide is also no replacement for real-world experience, training and study. Memorizing the contents of this book will not make you a candidate to be an appraiser for Christie's or Sotheby's... but if you are an amateur collector or have been collecting for years, it's a great reference to have at your fingertips.	2001-12-05

I didn't know what I was getting into and bought an established 140 gallon tank with rocks and fish. The second hand tank had been neglected and there were only 3 surviving fish and the rock didn't look too healthy. I had no idea what I was headed into and I bought and killed a number of beautiful, expensive fish out of total ignorance.<br />This book would have not only saved me a lot of money, but a lot of headache, heartache and trips to the local fish store.<br />Dr. Shimek includes tips on inexpensive ways to equip the hardware and contents w/o spending an arm and a leg on overpriced items at the store. He tells you what animals to avoid (especially for beginners) and which ones are must-haves.<br />For a beginning book, it is packed w/ info in just over 125 pages and in a very affordable package. Most aquarium books are VERY expensive and you'll never read the whole thing.<br />I read this book in about 2 weeks (I work full time and I'm a slow reader) by taking it with me during my lunch hour and it has already saved me hundreds of dollars in items/livestock I was considering on purchasing.<br />My only criticism is the lack of photos of critical things the author was citing. There are tons of high quality photos in this book, but some creatures were mentioned that I would have like to have seen represented in a photo and still have no idea what the author was talking about.<br />The author does assume some knowledge in some areas where it seems he may have forgotten his audience.

If you've seen &quot;The Matrix,&quot; you know how after seeing it for the first time, your mind reels, thinking about reality, perception and the true meaning of life and freedom.  You will have the same haunting introspective thoughts after reading &quot;Brave New World.&quot; The novel is incredibly visionary, especially in light of the fact that it was written in 1932.<br />Huxley foresaw not only a television in every home, but one in every room, communication and entertainment devices everywhere. Movies called &quot;Feelies&quot; in which the viewer sees, hears, smells and feels the action (can you say &quot;virtual reality?&quot;). A society in which everything is turned upside down... the important things in life; loyalty, family, faith, monogamy, individuality are thought to be &quot;anti-social&quot; and perverse and even obscene... while promiscuity, drug use and wanton spending are considered virtues.<br />A society bent on economic stabilty so much, that it sacrifices the very need for economics - citizenry. Children are not born, they are &quot;decanted&quot; in hatcheries and conditioned like Pavlov's dogs to like or dislike the things that will make them &quot;content&quot; in their pre-destined station in life.<br />I saw the made for TV movie based on this book a couple of years ago and wanted to read this book ever since. This book will make you think. It will make you look around and see how the media and government continues to spin around us as we're usually oblivious to the things that matter.<br />As a society, we are so consumed with &quot;self&quot; and temporary pleasures, that we don't treasure the things that really matter until they are taken away from us.

I wish I could do something like that!&quot; Now you can!  Ranging from the country-craft,  cheesy look to the artsy-fartsy weird, this book shows you in clear,  up-close photos how to prepare either new raw furniture or old beaten-up  pieces for glazing and decorative painting.<br />The book includes  step-by-step instructions on how to create your own stencils and despite  what your painting ability is, you'd be amazed what you can do.<br />Projects  range from the extremely simple to the highly adventurous, but all are  possible to do. A photo spread of tools used and techniques how to use them  are shown... even how to remove mildew from old furniture! All the  materials found in this book can be acquired at a hardware store, art/hobby  store, and many items you have laying around the house.<br />This book gets  right to the point and there is no fluff, just the information you need and  detailed, well-shot photographs.	2000-07-30

It made me laugh, because I was the webmaster for Pepsi.com when this book came out.  They were viewing the  site out of the context of the frame it was supposed to be in (they  purposely launched a new browser window from within the fixed-sized frame  and maximized the window to show a tiling background), which was misleading  and a bit inflamatory to those of us who slave over a site that at the time  was around 650MB per issue and changed top to bottom every single  month.<br />The screenshot they got of the site was also of a help screen that  was up for about 1 week and then altered. The entire site is done in Flash,  now, and a lot of the cross-browser, cross-platform issues that were such a  barrier in the past are now a moot point.<br />They point out some valid  points about contrast, abuse of animation, but this is a book best suited  for beginning designers, not seasoned pros.<br />They haven't come out with a  newer volume and despite the description of this book (I am submitting a  revision today) as being a 1998 book, the copyright of the book I have  (same ISBN number) is 1996. That's 28 in dog years and a millenium in web  years. While good design is still good design, despite the year, even  casual surfers who've been surfing for a few months will find some of this  info old-hat.<br />I must admit that it's a little unfair to criticize a  technical book 4 years after it hit the shelves, but my main criticisms are  the same as when I first purchased the book a few years ago.  Even then,  there were many free on-line tutorials that covered the same topic of basic  design and definite design faux pas.<br />I do keep this on my shelf in my  office, the book is a nicely presented volume and clients find it quite  amusing... but other than that... eck.	2000-07-27

The economy-of-line drawings are sweet and simply precious. The hardbound book is a classy-presented volume suitable for a coffeetable or as the &quot;feature&quot; on your bookshelf. The back  spine is black cloth and the front and back covers are smooth clay paper.  The pages are thick, sturdy cotton and just shy of being considered card  stock... very nice.<br />During a stormy night, a young girl, probably 9-12  years old, has trouble sleeping and her dog keeps her company as she  ponders life's deepest questions.  Her dog attentively follows her as she  raids the refrigerator, brushes her teeth and sits on her bed. As she eats,  you see many little bone-shaped dog treats on the floor... it is just too  cute!<br />During the night, her parents are obviously asleep and her dog is  the only bounding board she has for questions such as, &quot;Will I know  when it's my time to die?&quot; and &quot;Will it hurt?&quot; and makes  suppositions about her future and station in life.<br />The book wanders  closely into the realm of new age, but it doesn't really teach any  &quot;new&quot; concepts... the thoughts the little girl is pondering are  thoughts all kids have, but rarely share with anyone... thoughts and fears  that stay with us if a belief system is not introduced in the home.  This  is a great book to read with your children... it opens up topics of  discussion in a very non-threatening environment and opens the stage for  teaching children your beliefs concerning what happens when we die,  etc.<br />The book might be a little to intimidating to very young readers to  absorb by themselves, but as a night-time read with a parent, even a five  year old can participate in conversation about such topics... but really  young readers may have trouble with the detailed drawings. Visually, the  drawings are for more sophisticated eyes. As an adult, I just love this  little book.	2000-07-25

Long before I ever saw the first episode of &quot;The Simpsons,&quot; I was reading the &quot;Life is Hell&quot; cartoon by Groening in a local weekly paper.  Campy and dryly hilarious  most of the time, and occaisionally drop-dead funny material.<br />I've got  this book on my coffee table. The whimsical drawing style  of  Groening is  adorable and humorous to look at w/o even reading the voice bubbles and  captions.  As much as I enjoy thumbing through this book once in a while, I  didn't find any one cartoon that made me laugh outloud... it was more of an  intellectual, &quot;now -that's- funny!&quot; that I would say to myself...  but still insightful cartoons. I already had &quot;Love is Hell&quot; which  made me laugh outloud consistently... this book is not in par with that one  on the laugh meter, but it is in intelligence.	2000-07-24

After hearing the author tell of her near death experience on &quot;Oprah,&quot; I thought I'd read the book to glean more insight. Eadie is a good writer  and the reading is brisk and easy and the book itself is not very  long.<br />While I believe the author truly believes the account of her NDE, I  find some of it contrary to some underlying principals of the Bible ... and  considering she makes several quotes from the Bible, it is  relevant.<br />Regardless of my personal feelings concerning what did and  didn't happen to the author, the book is very insightful regarding the  needs of the human spirit.<br />Her story of being a lonely, mistreated girl  on an Indian reservation was moving and heartbreaking.  To see how people  who could have had such an impact on a little child abused their role and  treated her like human garbage because of her heritage made me cringe.  Often times when we talk to children, we forget that they will one day be  adults and most likely remember every instance of our encounter with them  if it is either extremely harsh or extremely benevolent. It makes you  think... do you want to be remembered in the thoughts of others, and if so,  how?<br />Regardless of your take on the validity of her account, her  descriptions are emotional and convincing and can really change the heart  of the reader.	2000-07-17

It's akin to learning about duty and  loyalty from watching &quot;Star Wars.&quot;  The work takes the concept of  &quot;the Devil's advocate&quot; to a whole new level. By a strange set of  circumstances (covered in the book's Introduction/Forward), we are privy to  private written correspondence from one devil to another devil on the finer  points of directing their &quot;patient&quot; to think evil thoughts and to  commit evil deeds.<br />The concept of a little devil sitting on your shoulder  is magnified by the dubious fiends whose ultimate goal is consume the souls  of those they lead astray as though they were food.  Lewis brings forth  several ways of re-thinking how we think and addressing the real heart of  the matter. The book is an easy read and is entertaining to boot. Lewis  intended this work (as his other books such as &quot;The Narnia  Chronicles&quot; and &quot;The Great Divorce&quot;) to be a fantasy that  teaches, not a dramatized version of doctrine. Regardless of your  background or your beliefs, the book's underlying themes concern the true  nature of good an  evil and how we use our will to apply good or evil onto  those we care about and onto those we don't.	2000-07-16

This book takes the sloppy creative process and pretty much streamlines it into a more productive  method of thinking things out and solving problems.<br />While there are  examples of real creative work, the book focuses more on process than one  product. If you're constantly living on mental post-it notes and flying by  the seat of your pants when coming up with new ideas, this book might just  be the ticket for you to get the creative process more organized.  I have  seen a few reviews that cited a problem with the size of the font used in  the book...

Some rare, some common, but absolutely incredible  creatures.<br />The Lesser Anteater looks like a toy... absolutely precious.  Then there is the Axolotl... something that looks like a cross between a  salamander, a koosh ball and a beanie baby... it even has a smile! These  aren't drawings, but up-close photographs of some of the most fascinating  looking animals you've ever seen.<br />The glasswing butterfly will make you  take a double-take as will the musk deer... have you ever seen a deer with  fangs before? I watch nature shows all the time, but I was surprised to see  how many animals I to date had never heard of. Sure, some of them you will  have seen before, such as the Manatee, but these won't be animals that are  commonly known to children and any lover of animals, science and nature  will adore looking at these bright photographs.	2000-07-08

When I first started, I had to teach myself, because there were literally  no books on the subject.<br />While there are now literally thousands of  Internet books, hundreds  devoted to HTML  alone, you'd be lucky to find  one book back in the early 90s. When I found this book, there were already  about 50 books on the market. I glanced through the index to see the topics  covered and saw that many of the things I wanted to learn about were listed  in the index, so I bought it right on the spot.<br />The only reason I haven't  thrown the book away or used it as firewood, is that it has 2 pages w/  ASCII codes for uncommon characters (such as - for the em-dash).<br />Other  than that, the book is totally useless. There are some CGI scripts, but  you're not taught how to implement them and typos and mis-information  abound in this book. There was absolutely nothing in this  &quot;construction kit&quot; that I was able to find useful in creating  anything for the web.	2000-07-06

When a  friend with children comes over to visit, this book will usually occupy  them for well over an hour... the images are so real, you feel like you can  reach in and touch the fossils and other images portrayed.<br />A fabulous  photo reference for artists as well... it's rare that any book contains so  many superb studio-quality photos of so many diverse types of bones.

The goal of this book is to relax  the parent and encourage them to take a straight-forward, but not  overwhelming approach to teaching their kids... there are no materials for  learning or illustrations to share with your kids... this is a humorous  book for grownups, and not a manual on teaching the subject.

When I first took sign language, it was beeing taught as Siglish (Signed English) and this was the perfect text for beginners. Lottie Riekehof has done an  excellent job of assembling the best signs for beginners and each lesson  contains enough variety to keep students engaged.<br />This text should not be  used to teach yourself sign language, however. While I consult this book  for a refresher and a reference, I can't imagine how I'd be signing if I  hadn't had a real human instructor explain the idiosynchrocies of signing.  Signing is much more than the hands, the entire face and body are needed in  expressing not only emotion, but meaning... the signs for &quot;shy&quot;  and &quot;prostitute,&quot; for example, are very similar looking and could  not be properly distinguished by a text alone.<br />If you're starting a study  group or a class, or even if you're taking a class and using a different  text, this is a great book to have on your reference shelf.	2000-07-04

The course was superby taught by a husband and wife team, both who worked at residential schools  for the deaf for over 25 years.  This book was the text for the first 2  semesters and I still have it on my shelf.<br />Extremely detailed, lots of  exlplainations and superb drawings. The text is spiral bound, which is  awesome for laying a book flat while practicing signs. If you carry this  book with you in a backpack, however, you should keep the book in a  protective bag... the spiral binding makes the book very vulnerable to  pages ripping away while being jostled in a backpack.<br />This text should  not replace classroom instruction. There is no text that can replace a real  human being explaining how one sign looks exactly like another depending on  context, facial expressions and body language. You can easily embarrass  yourself by assuming you can figure out the drawings and go about  conversing in ASL with someone w/o the benefit of real one-on-one practice  with another human being. Signs like &quot;prostitute&quot; and  &quot;shy&quot; are almost identical to the learner and if you're talking  to someone and you say &quot;I'm shy,&quot; you might end up getting a  bunch of raised eyebrows if you don't do it just right.  Signs for  &quot;lemon&quot; and &quot;lesbian&quot; are also very closely similar...  you can imagine the types of mis-understandings that can occur if you don't  learn these signs properly.<br />This warning is not meant as discouragement.  If you have already learned the manual alphabet and find yourself to be  quite adept, ASL will probably be a breeze to you... at least it was to me.  Some people really take to it and others don't. Spoken language is not my  strong suit and I was a late talker to begin with. If my college didn't  offer ASL as a foreign language requirement, I would have never graduated.  Regardless of your aptitude, study and practice is essential for good,  rapid signing... and more importantly, signing that can be understood. Even  if you become a wiz at signing, you must have practice at reading other  people's signs or you won't be able to have a conversation.  It's been 8  years since my last ASL class and wlithout anyone to practice with, I've  forgotten a lot of signs, so I constantly refer to this book... it's a  great reference for those wanting to freshen up on forgotten signs or to  use to learn in the classroom or with a study partner.rdless of your aptitude, study and practice is essential for good,  rapid signing... and more importantly, signing that can be understood.

Atkin's book is easy to read and he presents medical terminology and concepts in a manner that is easy to understand regardless of your  knowledge of science or biology.<br />Many of the concepts just make sense,  especially for someone like me that comes from a family with a high  incedence of diabetes and low blood sugar.<br />Atkins cites many medical  reports and findings in his book, but I was dismayed when I recently saw  him on C-SPAN being interviewed with other prominent doctors. The doctors  were asking him to cite evidence that his diet works as well as he claims  and he said, &quot;We don't have any scientific proof yet, but we hope to  have some soon.&quot; What!  His book clearly states that he has  documented proof over the 25 years he's been  running his  center.<br />Although the book is quick, easy reading, it's a bit much to read  Atkin's constant self references to his superiority to other doctors and  &quot;wrong&quot; opinions.  I still gave the book 3 stars due to it's  straight-forward approach to what makes us addicted to carbohydrates and  how to avoid them.<br />Atkins clearly states that while the diet works for  most, it won't work for all, but it's hard to know for sure since he  recently stated on television that he doesn't have scientific proof that it  works at all.	2000-06-20

They can  really get those creative synapses firing away and get you inspired to  develop a new layout you would have never thought of otherwise.  I have  this book on my reference shelf and I consult it quite a bit. Some (but not  all) of the letterheads and business cards identify the type of paper and  the cost associated with production which can be very insightful and  prevent you from being &quot;too inspired&quot; and go beyond  budget.<br />Superbly done photographs of the materials helps you to almost  feel like you can touch the different types of paper. Excellent  descriptions are also included.	2000-06-19

It's rare that a  mainstream book, especially a relatively inexpensive one, covers both  platforms. The book also covers both Internet Explorer and Netscape  Navigator/Communicator so that the beginner realizes the limitations that  the 2 top platforms and 2 top browsers bring into play.  This helps  beginners from designing scripts that are only viewable with the same  configuration that he/she has, unknowingly excluding other viewers.	2000-06-17

Even though there were no English words anywhere in the book, I could totally understand what was being communicated by the illustrations.<br />The children  and adults drawn in the book are endearing and expressive. And I laughed  outloud in the bookstore as I thumbed through it. The expressions on the  characters' faces are just adorable.  Adults of my parents generation were  a little too shy or aloof when the topic of sexuality or body parts came  up. Many adults of my generation state quite clearly that they will do it  different, but it's hard to know how to break the ice on such topics when  your only experience was with parents that acted as though the subject  matter was taboo. My own parents were pretty forthcoming, but I know that  was the exception and not the rule.<br />A simple and to-the-point book with a  simple and to-the-point title.	2000-06-15
US	51391300	RADV6X8NXBDXX	0818402539	746587063	Where Did I Come From?	Books	5	15	19	N	N	Great illustrations, straight forward information	I don't have children (yet), but when they do, this book will be accessible to them at a very young age. Adults will be tickled by the adorable illustrations (although some may be shockingly more graphic than  you may expect)... they are straight-forward and yet non-threatening.<br />The text is also to-the-point, but more friendly than blunt... just  enough information to satisfy young, curious minds without giving  information overload. A great book to read before you even have children as  it will help to mentally 'pshyche' you up to being able to more freely  discuss the topics of sex and reproduction with your children when the  subject comes up.	2000-06-14
US	51391300	R1LDWN5OWWPLJQ	0805420487	94824058	The Great Divorce	Books	5	427	438	N	N	Vivid fantasy of a bus ride through Heaven and Hell - WOW!	Only C.S. Lewis can write a story like this. A man takes a bus ride through Hell, then Heaven and witnesses the choices made by others in their lives.<br />The vivid stories within the story show that indecision is still a  decision... it underscores the petty things in our lives that we allow to  dominate us, things that will still plague us in Hell for eternity if we  don't abandon them.<br />Lewis' concepts (fantasized, of course) of the  substance of spirit versus the substance of flesh and blood are incredibly  thought provoking.  There are mental images I got from reading this book  that I will never forget.<br />It is basic truth - you choose life, you choose  death, or you choose not to choose. You will either give up the things that  are holding you down (whether they be bitter resentments, anger, material  gain, control, etc.) or you will cling to them until they become your  master and you their slave.<br />The book presents these concepts in such a  non-threatening way that you've gotten a life lesson that you don't realize  until you've finished this short, yet vibrant book.	2000-05-26

I bought quite a bit of  intro books when I wanted to put up my first web page... they are all boat  anchors and door stops now.<br />I have been a professional web designer for  over 4 years and I owe it to this easy intro by Tim Evans. I read the small  book in one day and I had my first web page up in 5 minutes.<br />Anytime  someone asks me how to get into web design &amp; programming, this is the  only book I recommend.<br />It's cheap, it's short and it gets right to the  point.  Thanks to Mr. Evans for being a cybergeek AND being able to speak  to neophytes at the same time!	2000-05-25
US	51391300	R18CS3WDMKTJH1	0452262933	337991686	1984	Books	5	292	329	N	N	Big Brother is watching you - read this book and see how!	George Orwell's classic was incredibly visionary. It is hardly fathomable that this book was written in 1948.  Things that we take for granted today - cameras everywhere we go, phones being tapped, bodies being scanned for  weapons remotely - all of these things were described in graphic detail in  Orwell's book.<br />Now that we have the Internet and people spying on other  people w/ webcams and people purposely setting up their own webcams to let  others &quot;anonymously&quot; watch them, you can see how this culture can  develop into the Orwellian future described in &quot;1984.&quot;<br />If  you've heard such phrases as &quot;Big Brother,&quot; &quot;Newspeak,&quot;  and &quot;thought crime&quot; and wondered where these phrases came from,  they came from this incredible, vivid and disturbing book.<br />Winston Smith,  the main character of the book is a vibrant, thinking man hiding within the  plain mindless behavior he has to go through each day to not be considered  a thought criminal. Everything is politically correct, children defy their  parents (and are encouraged by the government to do so) and everyone pays  constant allegiance to &quot;Big Brother&quot; - the government that  watches everyone and knows what everyone is doing at all times - watching  you shower, watching you having sex, watching you eat, watching you go to  the bathroom and ultimately watching you die.<br />This is a must-read for  everyone.	2000-05-25

I've told friends about it and even though I haven't seen the book in years, I can still vividly remember the expression on the pig's face when he got stuck in the cement.  As a  learning disabled child (undiagnosed at the time, but I knew that reading  was a chore nonetheless), I found the book not only easy to read, but I was  in love with the expressive illustrations of the pig.  An absolutely  adorable character. It's a parable in many ways to the way a child feels  when they don't get their way.  The farmer and his wife loved this pig very  much and it's obvious in the telling of the story. It's short enough to  read as a bed-time story to your kids and even the &quot;scary&quot; parts  are brief and even humorous.  If more stars were available, I would add  them.	2000-03-23
