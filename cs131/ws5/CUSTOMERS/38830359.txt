If these folk tales reaveal anything, it is the simplicity and purity of African people! Each story has a moral value, to teach human beings about life in the simplest way possible drawing similarities and differences from the animals living among them. Such a clever method to teach about life and human qualities.<br /><br />Although I missed Mma Ramotswe's clever hints and her humor, nevertheless Smith prevails as a special writer who presented something old with all that glory and sweetness to enlighten us all!	2005-09-03

I have to say that Rowling has great imagination and what started with an 11 year old wizard with all the fun that magic can bring has matured and is ready to face the unavoidable! You see Harry more developed as a character, a wizard trying to become the leader and face his destiny, a teenager with mixed and confusing feelings.<br /><br />The book is the thread that weaves together all the pieces from all 5 books, the truth behind Harry Potter and Tom Riddle. It is definitely darker and more mysterious than the others. It also reveals how immature Rowling, the writer, is. It is told with the same style of an actual story -telling. You proabbly won't feel that because of the uncanny events and revelations throughout the book.<br /><br />I definitely enjoyed the story, some parts were really dark and evil. Rowling somehow prepares you to that darker side of the story and while reading you anticipate something sad and evil to happen which leads to that climatic end where Harry is once again lavished with love and strength.	2005-09-03

I remebered Where The Heart Is reading this book, because it has the same lucky feeling all around, a little girl in a miserable situation trying to find love, the truth and the meaning of life. It is a page turner, you also feel that you know what is going to happen next, but you wait till you read it.<br /><br />Reading the first part of the book about Lily growing up and her current situation, I anticipated that the story would be more mysterious and more challenging, but then it became very predictable and I lost interest, I kept reading to confirm my speculations. I loved the connectivity between humans and bees, and I thought the same mystery and magic would revolve around Lily's story, I was a little disappointed!<br /><br />Love has no boundries, every human being is important and vital to the greater scheme of life.	2005-09-02

I felt that as a writer he became more mature and addressed his humor and sarcasm at the right moment, drawing laugh out loud conclusions and hilarious observations. It is so clever to be able to acknowledge your mistakes and way of life and make fun of yourself and Sedaris does amazingly well!<br /><br />The book is a collection of stories from his childhood and his  life as a writer. Each story has its own glow and message, reading along you wonder if his family is the reason behind this comedian or that he sees life from a different prospect!	2005-09-02

Reading a Steve Martin book, I expected something hilarious and shallow, but I enjoyed every part of this book thoroughly. A simple narration yet with great depth and insight. It is so hard to portray the suffering of someone's mental illness and be true and show how sad it is, and I applaud Martin for such a great job. You explore someone else's life through their eyes and mind, feel their pain- although sometimes they can't realize that- their sadness and how life seems so complicated and troublesome, nothing is so easy even crossing the street is a dilemma. You live with Daniel day in and day out till he reaches a point when he realizes that he has to change and that was the personal growth of that 33 year old boy genious.<br /><br />A great read!	2005-09-02

For me, time seemed to linger by and moved so slowly to accommodate the events. I can understand now the controversy that the book created as it hits a major belief of Christianity.<br /><br />I enjoyed it because I think it was intended, as Sauniere wanted it to be, a puzzle for his granddaughter to discover the truth about her family. That simple! All the adventures and discoveries that Langdon and Neveu uncovered were part of Sauniere's world, whether they are facts or not, is yet to be unearthed.<br /><br />The writing style is simple, repetitive which I found necessary with all the bulk of information. Brown is clear and although he tries to complicate the plot, it releases itself very naturally in seconds. I could imagine Langdon thinking and rushing from one place to the other, now I feel I need another trip to Paris to discover those mysteries on my own or maybe a movie will do!	2005-01-29

We meet Amir as an adult living in California and he takes us back to his childhood growing up in Afghanistan. The story of a privileged kid, raised by his dad and his servant Ali and son Hassan. It portrays the differences between father and son, the ordeal that Amir goes through to live up to the image that his dad has for him, how this affected him as a kid and his behaviour and the price that a son has to pay for his dad's mistake! Meanwhile, the history of the country decorates the background, and is more emphasized when Amir comes back home to prove to himself that he is a true friend and trustworthy.<br /><br />The book is beautifully written, emotions are well expressed that I truly cried when Amir did, and felt the pain that Hassan felt and the cold hearted dad who succeeded in keeping his secrets from the only person whom he had by his side. I sometimes forgot that it is the story of Amir, not the memoirs of Hosseini himself.<br /><br />A good read. Fresh and optimistic as its ending!	2005-01-18

The way Haddon captures Christopher's way of thinking and behaving is unbelieveable. It made me appreciate what a \\"normal\\" human being is!<br /><br />The narrator is Christopher, a 15 year old autistic British boy. He wants to solve the mystery of the neighbor's dog that he discovered dead. His path to reveal the killer, takes him to another reality that he couldn't comprehend.<br /><br />I could never have imagined how autistic people think, but this story takes you into the minds of one in a simple and clear way that made me sometimes laugh, others cry, not because it is a sad story- it is- but because this kid just couldn't grasp what is so obvious and just copuldn't see the truth. While you as a reader can realize what is going to happen, yet you wait for Christopher to face the truth at his pace.<br /><br />It left a great impression on me, while we take everything for granted, when others can't even enjoy a hug!	2005-01-18

I can't deny that this book is really funny, I got hooked from the first page reading about his speech problem but after several chapters, I lost interest, it is really hilarious to read about his family, but then the comic mood didn't satisfy me as a reader wanting more essence to his novel. It became a narration of a gay 40 something male and his wretched life, from drugs, failure in school, living in Paris with his boyfriend and really nothing substantial. Even when he talks about his family and how weird they are, you laugh hard, but then he leaves it as an open window for you to comment. You wonder what made him lead such a life, his parents? the way he grew up?<br /><br />The writing is easy and smooth. You feel sometimes as if he is actually talking to you which makes it a fun read.	2005-01-17

It is a quick read, funny, sad, you sympathize with each one of them, feel their hearts broken, laugh out loud at their mischief, but also sense the love and trust they have for each other.<br /><br />I enjoyed Moriarty's style, a little suspence, sometimes predictable, definitely refreshing!	2005-01-17

I don't think I will ever read anything similar. What a horrible story! I am not sure if this is the style of such stories, but it is so unbelieveable to the degree that you think the characters are either not mature or devils.<br /><br />It is like a science fiction plus horror movie, you can certainly predict the outcome though it is dull and pretentious. Some messages appear commenting on one kind of rich people's lives, but I don't think they belong to our century. You think with all the civilization and the development in science and computers, people are skeptical and challenging, but this story shows that human are so naive to look for answers and defend what they own, even to be responsible for their own children!<br /><br />I would have enjoyed it more if it was the story of a poor girl married to a rich guy who suddenly goes into a coma and then the wife finds herself alone raising her daughter and protecting her from her evil grandparents. This is just the simple version of the story without the additional features where she unveils the truth about her marriage and that island!	2005-01-17

This series gets better and better. This fourth book took another turn which I think is a good idea!  It is good!!<br /><br />It is not only about Mma Ramotswe but also those who are part of her life, Mr. J. L. B. Matekoni, Mma Makutsi, the apprentices, the children. Each book tells us a little more about the people in her life, and this book is about Mma Makutsi. What a delightful character, if you think Mma Ramotswe is clever and funny, wait to learn more about Mma Makutsi. I just laughed and could imagine her walking with her new green shoes that usually tell a lot about their owner! Just those simple remarks that we might neglect sometimes but it is what makes the No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency so famous and successful.<br /><br />Mma Makutsi opens her own project which proves to be as successful and she falls in love for the first time! Just charming! Watching her dance and flutter...<br /><br />There is also the new detective agency, but that proved a failure compared to Mma's insight and sincerity. It is a small country where everybody knows everbody... you just need to ask keeping in mind the Botswana morality.<br /><br />Mr. Smith never fails to state his views on humanity, culture and even politics, but you never get bored of those remarks, you expect them as you would know that this is what Mma Ramotswe would say in this and that situation!<br /><br />Still, there is no wedding date!	2004-07-20

It shifts a little from the route of culture, and emphasizes on everyday issues just like in any other place. We don't see Mma explaining traditions and their meaning, but trying to understand human nature, whether it was depression or revenge, she finds a way to show reality and truth, even her assistant found her own way of facing truth.<br />I can't wait to find out what is going to happen to Mr. Matekoni, and what happened to the ring?!!	2004-07-03

I have been to Italy and the architectural significance really overwhelmed me, I was reading it with passion and longing.<br />On the other hand, the story itself is nothing new, a heart filled with rage decides to get revenge and uses a form of destruction to kill his boss, in this case it is the Pope, to ultimately reach his own goal, but later discovers a hidden secret which Brown intended to be the final magnificant twist, but completely lost its magic, I think, after the complicated countdown, and none but a ruthless Arab to complete the picture!!? who plays the Assassin.<br /><br />So you find all the fusion  and interaction  of nationalities and languages, with mistakes, especially the Arabic language, and the hero ultimately defies death and survives a jump from the sky and at the end wins- ironically- a prize which reminded me of 007!<br />The author records everything, minute by minute, though sometimes you feel like these people must be on another planet, because their minute is like an hour on Earth!<br />I am not sure if it is worth reading, but it is amazing that a book so fragile made such a buzz:(	2004-07-03

She made it clear though that she accepted his proposal not because she is a woman who needs a man to protect her nor to be his servant NO she was satisfied with her life and her job and hurt from her experience with one failed marriage that was still so fresh in her memory..<br />I love the series because of Mma's character. She wants to change and wants to learn about the modern world and life in the new century but doesn't shun her past .. on the contrary she is proud of her heritage and of her country and what makes it special. Through her investigations, Smith tackles various issues, he states Mma's point of view as the opinion of the learned people and leaders of her country and shows how a foreigner would percieve it... true and simple. He uses simple language, affirms the traditions of the country, draws the difference in behavior between past and present...

A heaven that unites us!<br />I liked the idea of an integrated world where every person has a role and whatever each person does affects another whether you know it or not. I think Mr. Albom wanted to makes us feel more responsible and more considerate to all around us. It is a universal message as human beings living on Earth: show respect and caring for all around you. He created a world where nothing else matters, not religion nor race nor age and called it Heaven.<br />It is sad that Eddie had to die to realize what it is all about, to understand why things happened that way.

What really affected me reading this book is this cold shattered childhood with restraint feelings and emotions which resembles the places where she grew and moved. I didn't feel any warmth, the severe cold of Alaska spread all over the novel even when she found stability for a short period of her childhood.<br />Life is an open never ending experience with its ups and downs, and this is what the story is all about. Each person has his own story to tell, but what made this one different is that you actually grow with Julia, from the little girl's point of view, seeing the world through her eyes, reading her own words, to the teenage girl who tries to find answers, who expresses her wonder of certain people and behaviors, and then the woman, you sense her growth, her helplessness and her quest to understand life.	2004-06-14

I expected a major change in this book because of the rebirth of Lord Voldemort.. it was sure different in style from the others .. the question-answer form where almost half of the book raises a lot of questions that build up to a climax where everything is finally answered and revealed to us and mostly to Harry who although during the last 4 years went through a lot of troubles and horrible encounters but still he is a boy who lived and definitely too young for sound judgement and decisions!<br />Well, I don't know if it was Dumbledore's mistake but I am so happy to finally know the importance of the scar and why Voldemort wanted to get rid of Harry .. I didn't expect the death of any character.. I knew someone will die .. and while I was reading kept convincing myself that it is not that character .. I was in suspense for a while but certainly didn't expect it to be such a tragic event not only for Harry but for us as fans!<br />Major changes evolve in this book that influence the events of the story ..

I couldn't feel it...  her suffering and unhappiness over the years felt more overwhelming than what she finally had... she never forgot her home, her childhood memories were with her all the time seen with the eyes of a nine year old, and her sister was her family and no one filled in her place ..<br />A delicate sensual narrative full of imagery and soft breezes of superstition and circles of destiny!	2003-07-27

I totally enjoyed it. Even though it is a children's book, but adults can enjoy it and learn lessons from it too.<br />It is MAGICAL, keeps you entertained waiting to see what is going to happen and it never fails to surprise you! I think it contains a lot of messages for kids to see through themselves and figure out good and bad, right and wrong. Even for me (a grown up) it opened my eyes to simple truths that we tend to forget sometimes and try to act \\"wisely\\"!<br />Harry, Ron and Hermione face a problem and try to solve it.  It is about friendship, sacrifice and priorities.	2003-07-01

After all the publicity for book 5,  I started reading the first.<br />The story is not only about the orphan Harry who is living a miserable life at his aunt's. It is about courage, truth and self-confidence.  Magic comes from the inside and shines through one's self.  It is a lovely story, the magical part makes it out of this world, but if you look deep, they are only humans with conflicting feelings and different aspirations. Each with his own dream, choosing his own path to achieve it!<br />It is funny, bright and for all ages!	2003-07-01

The movie concentrates mainly on the love story of Lara and Yuri, but the book describes the whole political situation and life in Russia from the revolution of 1905 till the end of WW2.<br />Despite the tragedies and the sufferings, Pasternak is extremely romantic and sensitive to nature and to the surroundings...depicting all that is beautiful even amid the most horrifying pictures of war.  I think just to show us the hope and the endurance of the human soul. Even when I felt a little disappointed when there is no more Lara and Yuri for a while, Pasternak's description of the atrocities of war and the extremes that humans reach when fighting for their survival is gloomy and sad.  It gives a taste of the bitterness of war and a smell of the cheap human blood everywhere..<br />I loved it!  I even felt so heart broken just like Yuri when he reads Tonia's letter ... great story, tragic love, unaccomplished life!	2003-06-23

I read this book because it was the only book I found at the school's rummage sale!<br />I really enjoyed it.. it is a very tragic story but with a happy ending! It made me laugh, it made me cry .. and sometimes totally shocked..<br />The language is direct and sensitive ..the style is poetic .. I could draw a picture in my mind of all the characters, the library, the garden... you feel like you are with them watching as they move around you .. trying their best to beat all the odds..<br />A beautiful journey of strength .. self-confidence and determination.. what the love and support of friends can do.. miracles!!	2003-05-30

He is so sensitive and realistic ..just like a painter taking his time to finish his portrait after studying every stroke and every color..<br />Despite all the hardships that Siddhartha go through, you always feel at ease, relaxed .. totally enjoying the story.. It is full of wisdom .. extreme measures .. but as Siddhartha said no one can feed you his/her experience you have to try and learn .. you can choose to be a falling leaf or a star?! searching and looking for answers .. we can make our own future .. depending on which path we choose .. but fate and luck are part of this future ..and Love conquers all!	2003-05-17

Coelho takes you to depths you yourself take in times of hardships and happiness trying to find any kind of explanation to questions we ask ourselves everyday!<br />Veronika draws a picture of her future life based on her own path that she has taken .. useless .. fruitless .. nothing special .. she decides to die because she didn't like  what she saw.  Life in a mental hospital opened up her eyes and mind, and eventually her heart to view life from a different angle. ..through the help of other patients, and not to forget her doctor.<br />I've found the ending really surprising to such a serious subject .. but I think it understates how we sometimes blow things to larger proportions and forget about what really matters.<br />I really enjoyed it!  Veronika was just a means to an end that Coelho intended to prove.  Everyday is a miracle, so enjoy it and make the best of it. Love and friends make a big part of our lives. Many simple things .. a walk by a lake, a friend's smile, a blooming flower, we take for granted are actually a reminder of our own miracle on this planet!	2003-03-28
US	38830359	R3ECEJSJMFFUOV	039475526X	423697504	Cities of Salt	Books	5	14	15	N	N	A conflict of power ...	It is about the discovery of oil in Saudi Arabia, how it started and its affect on the people of that country. You read almost the first 100 pages just of the description of the oasis -like Wadi Al-Uyoun in the middle of the desert and its people how they live and what they do, just Bedouins living their life peacefully disconnected from everything and everyone around them except for the caravans that brought them sugar and flour and news of those who chose to work in other towns. The title refers to what they used to do before the discovery of oil, which is extracting salt from the sea.<br />Then, the gradual changes start with the arrival of the Americans, the demolition of their homes and tents, the digging for oil and the construction of the first pipeline. The ruthless greedy rulers who all they want is money and richness demonstrating their power over their own people favoring the Americans and giving them the green light to work and live on their own land as they wish.<br />The story is not about one character rather than about the city Harran which the Americans created out of nowhere to a famous and rich city deploying its people and all the Arabs around it. What is sad is those Bedouins who know absolutely nothing about the world around them. Even the Arabs from other countries are shown as educated civilized people, but not the Arabs of Saudi Arabia who were introduced to the necessities and accessories of life through the Americans and their neighboring Arabs. Harran itself is divided into American Harran and Arab Harran emphasizing the cultural and religious differences and the way the foreigners looked at the citizens.<br />Munif describes those situations in a very subtle way that you don't know whether to laugh or cry! He takes you into the heart and mind of each character so you really know how and what they feel and think about what is happening around them. They go with the flow wherever it takes them without any questioning or understanding; at the beginning they don't even know that they are actually building a pipeline!! Even their reaction at the end is not ultimate and decisive!<br />I think that Theroux delivered the feelings and the impact that Munif intended of his story. He also maintained the essence of the Arabic language and the implied meanings intended. A great book on the conflict of power and money!the beginning they don't even know that they are actually building a pipeline!!

I think to truly enjoy this story is to read it through Griet's eyes and heart ... to look at things from the point of view of a teenage girl .. still innocent and inexperienced .. poor and unpriviledged .. She takes you with her on her daily duties as a maid ... she describes the way she looks at her master and the unspoken magic she feels between them ... her description of her mistress ... her feelings towards her Pieter and his bloody nails .. it is the way those wide eyes looked on life and people around them!<br />Chevalier's style is original, simple and stunning! The meaning behind the title... the purity of Griet's emotions... I felt like I lived in that house and could imagine the kitchen , the attic .. even standing infront of the studio's window over looking the New Church... a very sentimental experience!<br />The ending is unexpected and romantic just like when Griet pierced her ear .. I thought he would give her the portrait .. although she says that she would never see it again .. it tells a lot about the way he felt towards her and about the kind of person he is even though he is not fully_exposed as a character.. I believe that Chevalier did this on purpose just to show us Vermeer the artist ... The Griet we see at the end is a mature young woman ...protective of her family ... thankful for her new life!<br />A beautiful story where fact and imagination intertwine to create an atmosphere filled with tension and love, and a better understanding of life!	2002-12-21

The fact that it is a real story makes it absolutely beautiful. It touches your heart just like Mitch touched his Coach's heart.It also reminded me of The Prophet with its universal message of love, humanity and death.<br />It is such a nice feeling to go back and pick up where you left off. As the professor said .. not everyone gets this chance. It makes you realize how short life is .. how precious everyday thing is .. waking up to the birds singing .. rain .. sunshine. Life takes us within its circles without a deep breath to take and relax .. running after success and money ...forgetting our friends and crushing our emotions ..<br />Albom narrates his story and describes his relationship with his teacher, and shifts from the present to the past, and then you go with him and visit his teacher again... without feeling the passage of time. He shows his feelings and expresses his fears in a natural subtle way that you quickly identify with him and know exactly what he is talking about.<br />I truly enjoyed it.	2002-11-05

It is a strange story .. at the beginning you might think it is one of those books dealing with something that could happen everyday .. but the way the characters are woven into the story .. the complications and the revelations of each one of them is way extreme!<br />A five day adventure .. a hideous ride .. a mockery of human life .. six different characters.. none of them was happy or satisfied with what he/she had .. each one of them wanted more and something better .. and took hard measures to reach their goals just like Dr. Skreta whom I think is ironically funny, smart and desperate!<br /> Kundera keeps you in touch with his characters .. you know what they think and how they feel .. you know their weaknesses and their strengths .. and what they want to accomplish ..yet I didn't expect such a tragedy!<br />Read it and enjoy!	2002-10-13

I really don't know if it exists... but it is where our story takes place in Palestine. The book describes the events that preceded the war of 1948, how the Jewish people settled by force, how the Palestinians reacted and what the Arabs did.. if anything!! It illustrates their humiliating and appalling exodus from their country.<br />I have heard a lot about it and studied history books, but nothing is compared to the telling of its own people ... to go back in time ... hear and see their miseries ... nothing I can say will express the feelings and confusion of a country... the feelings of entrapment and loss!<br />A 17 year old Yousif, who like any boy of his age is looking forward to graduate and declare his love to Salwa, is totally crushed and transferred to another world of  harsh reality and bloodshed. He fights with everything he has to get his love back and tries to do the same for his country. His vision and the future he foresees is a path of peace to return to his motherland! Hope and optimism penetrate through the clouds of war and death .. of a people who still sacrifices and survives under more than 50 years of violence and oppression.<br />Fawal  describes his country in the most beautiful way ..you can imagine it in front of your eyes even if you haven't been there..portraying its green vast hills, the valleys, the olive and pine trees, the orange orchards and Jerusalem .. a tragic holy land!	2002-08-18

He describes the hard work and the time he, his wife, Natalina and Lorenzo put to make this garden one entity of beauty and care. You take every step with him up the hill... see every tree and feel the warm sun ...and even smell the burning leaves. Of course Hesse never forgets to comment on human nature and life!<br />Whether he was planting his tree, describing the broken bough, the pavilion or the fall wind blowing at the old man's face... each poem has its message of contentment, serenity and natural beauty.<br />\\"The Lame Boy\\" is a recollection of his childhood and his relationship with a crippled boy, a \\"comrade\\" who taught him patience and understanding nature but could never call a friend!! He remembers his summers with this boy, going fishing together, showing his weak body but revealing his true qualities as a person. He talks about how we judge people and comments on the way he looked at his friend and what he thinks of him now after all those years.<br />I enjoyed reading the poems and I read the book more than once.
