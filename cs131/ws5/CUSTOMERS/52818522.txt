US	52818522	R2HS0UPQF2UVF8	0821718088	201346244	Dew Claws	Books	4	3	4	N	N	Good Zebra Horror book.	Dew Claws by Stephen Gresham was book written in the 1980's under the Zebra Horror label.  While the cover is a typical Zebra cover, with a scary looking skeleton, it really doesn't give you a lot of insight to what the book is about.  Dew Claws does have some elements of horror but really isn't all that terrifying.  It starts in a swamp where young Johnny Ray loses his uncle and brothers to some unseen force.  The story then picks up with Johnny living with another family but the swamp seems to be calling him back.  Dew Claws has a quick moving story and is worth a read if you are able to locate a copy of it.	2003-08-20

The story reminds you a bit of Rosemary's Baby meets It's Alive but the character development is strong and the work stands on it's own merit.  It took a while for this story to get really scary but once it does, it doesn't slow down until the end.  There are some descriptions of violence in this book that are really disturbing and graphic but that's all part of the &quot;horror&quot; in my book.  Just be prepared when the hammer comes into play.  Overall, a good, quick, read. I'll continue to check out other works by Mr. Clegg	2003-05-15

The story, which relvolves around a teen named Nick Aten, grabs you from the opening chapter. Something has happened to all the adults in the world whick will prove deadly to anyone under 19.  Nick and the teens he meets up with must find a way to survive in this new and frightening new world. This book has elements of Lord of the Flies, The Stand, and a little Night of the Living Dead all wrapped up in a great story.  This one's worth picking up.	2003-05-10

And after reading numerous lists of favorite baseball books by Amazon.com readers, it seemed that there was one unanimous choice, The Glory of Their Times, by Lawrence Ritter.  And let me say, that I wasn't dissapointed in the least.  The beauty of this book is that you feel like you yourself are sitting down with the different players interviewed and having them regale you with stories about playing baseball in the early 20th Century or earlier.  The players interviewed are not all household names which adds so much to it.  Most of us know the exploits of Cobb and Ruth.  Not as many know the stories of Harry Hooper, Wahoo Sam Crawford, and Paul Waner to name just a few.  This book is a pleasure to read through and all I can say is thank God that Mr. Ritter wrote this book when he did as all of the players interview here have since passed on I believe.  Don't miss this book!	2002-10-15

And while the book is critical of many of the means that Vince used to get where he is, it is also a very nice historical perspecive of the history of the business itself. I didn't expect it to go into as much detail as it did on the rise and fall of some of the other organizations, especially WCW and it's Monday Night Wars with the WWF.  Having been a long time fan, much of what I read I had known of before, but there was information that I hadn't heard as well.  This is a great read if you are interested in the business and the behind the scenes dealings of it.  If you are a die hard Vince McMahon fan, you may not like or believe all of what you read.  But, I can't imagine anyone with an interest in wrestling not gaining some knowledge of the business that they didn't have before.	2002-10-15

This book is more of a Gothic Romance, not like the later horror books that she would write. While fans of this genre might enjoy this read, I found it a bit too far from my preferred type of reading. But, despite this, I plan on reading many more of Ruby's books as I feel that she is truely one of the most under appreciated horror authors around.	2002-09-12

Once I got into this, I realized I was reading a very special book and that the positive reviews were right.  Now, it's not the most frightening book I've ever read and much of the &quot;horror&quot; in the book is actually the fear of the unknown. The final 30 pages probably have more horror in them than the entire book.  But the character development is great and by the time the book is ending, you are really drawn into the lives of the three friends who are the focal point of the book.  As other reviewers have mentioned, this book does have elements of King's &quot;Stand by Me&quot;, McCammon's &quot;Boy's Life&quot;, and Bradbury's &quot;Something Wicked This Way Comes&quot;.  And having enjoyed all of those books, it would stand to reason I would enjoy this book.  But, comparisons aside, it's an enjoyable read and it certainly won't be the last Laymon book that I read.	2002-09-12

But after reading this, I was amazed that this book did not garner the same kind of negative attention that Jim Bouton's \\"Ball Four\\" did.  Lee talks frankly about his drug use, his indiscretions with women, and his general disdain for the powers that be in baseball.  If a star today shared similar revalations, I can't imagine the furror it would cause.  Lee pitched a little before I started following baseball but his perspecive on things is timeless.  I highly recommend this book.	2002-09-12

I guess I thought that he wouldn't really have enough material to write more than a rehash of his first book.  But, just a little ways into &quot;Foley is Good&quot;, I realized why I enjoyed his first book so much.  Foley's story telling ability is amazing and his detailed description of his last days in the WWF are worth the price of the book alone.  I feel that his departure from the WWF has made a bigger dent in their product than they thought and reading this made me realize how much I really do miss seeing him on Monday nights.  If you're a fan of wrestling, or just another one of the &quot;Thousands and Thousands&quot; of Foley's fans, then check out this book.	2002-09-12
US	52818522	R28V9LA9P522CT	0671661876	769959007	Monastery	Books	5	0	0	N	N	Worth the Wait	Monastery is a book that was recommended to me several years ago from a friend who also enjoyed horror literature.  However, I never guessed how difficult it would be to find this book.  But I'm glad I finally did.  Monastery is set on an island in the Pacific Northwest where the Monks who maintain an old Monastery guard an ancient evil force.  When the inevitable happens and this evil is released upon the island, the only man who stands a chance against it is a solitary professional assassin. The lines between good and evil become somewhat grey in this story and by the end, you know that the final battle has not been fought.  If you can find this book at a reasonable price, it's well worth the read.	2002-09-12
US	52818522	RPC6K3D2PRRNI	0312912218	709183083	Down on the Farm	Books	3	2	2	N	N	A good start	Down on the Farm is a horror novel from the late 80's that really grabs your attention at the beginning with a malevolent creature from outer space which buries itself in the ground in the early part of the 19th century.  The story moves to present day where an old barn now covers the burial site and the creature is beginning to awaken. The story holds promise early as the creature is able to affect the minds of those people near it but soon the story tends to get muddled and a little hard to follow.  The ending is also a little abrupt.  It's as if the author simply chose to end the story rather than carry it out to a logical conclusion.  It's not really a common book, however, I can't recommend going out of your way to find it either.	2002-09-10

And I must say, that I was pleasantly surprised by Rock, Paper, Scissors.  The story really grabs your attention at the beginning with a horrific murder of a father with his daughter.  We then move to the present where this little girl, Sarah Peterson, has grown up and become a secret service agent as her father was.  She's hired to protect a shady government official and when she digs a little too deep into his life, she finds her own life in danger as well.<br />This book reads extremely well with great character development and an interesting story to go with it.  I haven't seen any other  books by Steven Samuel but will definately consider them if I do.  Well worth the read.  Thanks for the recommendation!	2002-09-10

While the North Platte Nebraska canteen is the backdrop, the real story here is the people who volunteered their time to make the soldier's time here as close to home as possible.  Greene interviewed a number of both volunteers and the soldiers who came through there and all remember the canteen as one of the fondest memories of a very difficult period in their lives.  Once Upon a Town is a very quick and enjoyable read and if you like any of Bob Greene's previous works, don't miss this.  I highly recommend it.	2002-06-19

Books	4	0	0	N	N	Angle Fans will enjoy	Kurt Angle's &quot;It's True, It's True&quot; is another in the series of biographies that WWE (still doesn't sound right)has put out over the last few years.  I found this book fairly interesting as I am a big Kurt Angle mark and it was nice to see what he did before he got into the pro ranks.  Since his career in pro wrestling is a short one, most of the book does focus on his amateur career.  I was amazed at how acomplished Angle was as an amateur and am amazed that WWE doesn't hype it more than they do.  But since his  bread and butter is portraying the heel, they probably don't want him to look to heroic.  But, make no mistake, when you read some of the injuries that he wrestled with at a world class level, you will respect the man.  Angle does come off a little arrogant at times but I think that there are probably few WWE performers that would stand a chance against him in a real wrestling match.  As has been said by other reviewers, it's not quite up to the standard of Mic Foley's first book but certainly a quick and interesting read.  I'd recommend it for any fan or amateur or professional wrestling.	2002-05-29

But having enjoyed almost every other Robert McCammon book I've read,  I didn't think it could be all bad.  I'm happy to say that I found this book most enjoyable.  Bethany's Sin is a small Pennsylvania town where the main character Evan, his wife Kay, and his daughter Laurie move.  It's soon apparent that life in this town is not as quaint and peaceful as it first appeared.  Kay begins having horrific and violent nightmares after meeting the towns mayor and primary antagonist, Kathryn Drago.  It's up to Evan to unravel the dark secrets of the town before its too late to save himself and his family from the horrors of the coming \\"killing month\\".  Sin is fairly quick read and has an interesting slant on the legend of the Amazon women and their hostile relationship with men.  Some of the descriptions of this are downright brutal. It's a good horror story with some very creepy moments. Well worth reading in my opinion.	2002-05-23

But, while this era is give some discussion, Billington gives equal billing to the time that he spent learning the craft in England, Canada, and Japan.  I never realized what a legitimate tough guy the Kid was as well as a locker room prankster.  I also didn't have any idea of the falling out between him and The British Bulldog.  Sadly, Billington's story does not end happily as he is wheelchair bound today but his story is an important chapter in the history of professional wrestling.	2002-05-06

After reading all of the reviews of Diamond Dallas Page's \\"Positively Page\\", it seems that readers either loved the book or detested it.  I have also read many wrestler biographies and while this wasn't the best one I've read, it certainly isn't as bad as many reviewers claim.  I found the most interesting part of this book was his journey into the wrestling world and where he actually decided to become a wrestler rather than just a manager.  I can't think of any other performer that has made that  kind of transition and I doubt that there will be another one with the absence of manager characters in the wrestling world today.  My only complaint with the book is that as it moves into the NWO storylines later in his career, he tends to fade in and out from \\"shoot\\" to \\"storyline\\".  Prior to that, the book was primarily a shoot.  All in all, not a bad book and it really makes you respect the hard work he put into going from a manager to a top of the card guy.	2002-05-06

This book, while fairly short, is a very good account of the wild ride of Missy's career.  I have to give Missy credit, she doesn't pull any punchs, even if what she's telling isn't that flattering to herself either.  And you won't believe the number of guys that are still wrestling today that Missy has been romantically involved with.  This book is funny and entertaining and if you were a fan of the old NWA, it's really worth checking out.	2002-05-06

Badly needing a break from his job as a foreign journalist, Lamb decides to fulfill a life long dream of driving accross the country visiting as many minor league baseball parks as he can.  Although baseball games are the  intended stops, his encounters with the people around the country are just as important, making this an enjoyable read whether you are a baseball fan or not. This book has inspired me to make an effort to visit more minor league parks where the game  is still just a game.  Make it a point to check this book out.	2002-05-01

But after a promising start, this book became more of a medical thriller than horror novel.  The character development was not particularly great and I found myself reading this to get through it rather than enjoying it. I know this is an early effort by Morrell and he has since moved into more the political intrigue genre but this book in my opinion is not worth the read.	2002-04-30

As a fan of horror novels, I read quite a few and rarely do I find one as engrossing and enjoyable as Dan Simmons Summer of Night.  If you are a fan of Stephen King's It, Robert McCammon's Boy's Life, and maybe Ray Bradbury's Something Wicked this Way Comes, then you will not be disappointed by this book. Summer is set in the early 1960's in a small town in Illinois just after school is out for the Summer.  The book revolves around five friends who each begin having some truely horrifying events happen to them.  The descriptions of these events are so vivid that it really took me back to when I was twelve and what things would scare me the most. This is the third Simmons book that I have read and by far and away, my favorite.  By all means, if you love horror, check out this book.	2002-04-30

The subject matter of several friends putting everything aside for a Summer and roadtriping around the country has always been appealing to me and this story didn't disappoint.

Much of the \\"corporate\\" attitude that the Cubs front office holds today was started well before many of us were born. The book is a great historical record of not only the Cubs, but of Major League Baseball itself.  Every baseball purist would love this book and it's a must read for any die-hard Cub fan.	2002-04-04

It is the story of a lonely, childless couple who befriend a young drifter only to have him move into their house, or more specifically, under the house.  Over time, they come to trust Richard Atlee enough to even invite him to live with them.  But, eventually, all good things must end.

This book is a very interesting story of some of the behind the scenes of major college basketball.  As in most of his books, the  seedy underside is explored in great detail here from recruiting scandal to protection of a star player who committed a major crime.

Well , you can't judge a book by its cover. (Did somebody say that once?)  Although, this book revolves around the front office and star quarterback of an expansion football team, there really is very little football going on. Instead, we are presented with some of the seedy side of a professional sports team with everything from point shaving to murder.  Not an uninteresting read but it does get slow in the middle.  The last section really picks it up and makes the read rewarding overall. Not as good as North Dallas Forty or The Conquering Heroes but certainly better than North Dallas After Forty.	2001-12-11

The pattern for his abuses were set young in his life and not necessarily as a result of his fame in the NFL.

I read this about a year before &quot;Deep Blue Sea&quot; came out and was amazed that no credit was given to this book.  The story lines are very similar.  I'd rate this book right along side Alten's MEG series for suspense, action, and a believable story.  I feel it was much more believable than Wilson's Extinct as well.  If you can find this book, it's worth picking up.	2001-10-23
US	52818522	R15D6BQD1D7FLF	0843932481	246124193	Saurian	Books	4	6	7	N	N	Unique horror novel a good read	From the very beginning, Saurian distinguishs itself as a very different kind of horror novel. The premise begins with a young boy growing up in a Florida oceanfront town. The innocence of youth is lost quickly when a monster unlike anything ever imagined destroys everything he knows. The remainder of the book follows him in adulthood and the repressed memories of this incident slowly surfacing. He discovers that not only did this really happen, but that others have experienced this horror and it still exists today. The beginning of this book has some extremely creepy moments. It slows down near the end but the character development is good enough that you'll want to follow it through to the end. This title is out of print but can probably be found used in many outlets. It is the first I have read by Schoell but will look for other titles in this genre in the future.	2001-09-17

I guess I fall somewhere in the middle.  While Simmons does a pretty good job of developing characters, I feel that the story they are placed in tends to drag a bit.  Melanie is by far the most complex character of the book, however, I went back and forth between whether I should pity her or hate her.  The book is quite long and easily could have been pared down a little to make it flow better.  The final scene is somewhat confusing and pointless as well.  But, as a whole, I didn't dislike this book.  Just expected it to grab my attention a little better than it did.  I have read one other Simmons book, Hyperion, and found it a bit more enjoyable a read.  As for a horror epic, I would lean toward McCammon's &quot;Swan Song&quot; or King's &quot;The Stand&quot; over this effort.	2001-08-21
US	52818522	R5381N96YWFJ4	0385018207	529722028	Down Bound Train	Books	4	0	0	N	N	Good scary short novel	I recently picked up a used copy of this book.  The book first explores the lives of five characters, all evil in some way.  The  darkest of these would be a little girl, Felicity.  This little angel has only tortured pets and murdered her mother in her short 7 or 8 years on earth.  Each of these characters end up on a train whose final destination is Hell.  This story would have made a great &quot;Night Gallery&quot; episode and was written around the time that show was on the air.  Might take a little searching to find this book as it is out of print.	2001-01-22
US	52818522	R2U9F15GF65X0I	0380708825	498307136	Literary Outlaw: The Life and Times of William S. Burroughs	Books	5	0	0	N	N	engrossing biography	I recently finished this biography and I must say it was one of the most interesting ones I have read.  I, as well as the other two reviewers of this book, am amazed that such a detailed history of a cultural icon is out of print.  This book starts with Burrough's Grandfather and ends with him in his life in Lawrence Kansas.  In between, you will find a life that few people could claim to have led, and still be alive well into their 80's.  The book also goes into great detail about the lives of the other Beat icons such as Kerouac, Ginsburg, and Cassady. This book is fairly graphic and does not paint a pretty picture of thier lives.  If I had read &quot;On the Road&quot; after reading this book, I might have looked at it in a whole different way. If you can find it, I highly recommend it.	2001-01-09
US	52818522	RI5TZ20S57U0B	0967304504	530440988	... never dream	Books	5	2	2	N	Y	Well done	I was recommended this book and I must say that it was deserved.  ...never dream is a vampire tale not unlike that of Rice's original Interview with  the Vampire yet it dispensed with some of the sensuality and eroticism that  Rice tended to lean towards, especially in the later installments.  Instead, you get a very well written story with great character  development.  The story is good by itself but the end is left with strong  hints that we may get a sequel. I hope so.  If you enjoy the horror and/or  vampire genre, definately check this one out.	2000-09-19
US	52818522	R19RZPOS0ST5YI	0821732587	335680428	The Children's Ward	Books	2	1	2	N	N	not all that scary	If you judge a book by the cover, you expect this book to be a fairly scary read.  However, it really never gets to that level.  The story takes  place in a hospital with a very special little girl causing tragedies to  those she percieves as a threat.  But, many of the deaths she causes are  for reasons that are not clearly explained.  A quick read but a not  particularly engaging one.  This is out of print now and I wouldn't  recommend going out of your way to find it.	2000-08-18
US	52818522	RKSA81MAIFRF4	0679444815	786105285	Timeline	Books	3	0	1	N	N	Typical Crichton	This is the sixth Crichton I've read and I can usually write the same review for every one. His storyline ideas are incredible.  Very believable science fiction ideas which translate over to movies well.  His character  development however is his weak point.  I found this to be true in Timeline  as well.  This story was not his best either, leaving you wondering what  the purpose of all this was by the time you are finished.  A fairly quick  reading book and not all bad, but I can't give it a rousing endorsement  either.	2000-06-19

This sets the stage for what awaits the Conway family.  Some very scary visuals.  I'm not sure if any of Saul's work has been turned into movies but this  would make a good one.  Quick read, worth checking out.	2000-06-19

Each of the characters is introduced with each suffering some horrible experience.  This book does get a bit graphic so if you offend easily, beware.  Tails off a bit at the end but overall, very  solid read.  I will look for books by this author in the future.	2000-05-05

US	52818522	RRULLPT6ARMWY	0425105334	122553244	The Talisman	Books	1	7	25	N	N	Overrated	I am amazed at the number of reviews on this site rating this book as &quot;The best book I have ever read&quot; and that I have read it 7 or 8 times.  (who reads a book that many times anyway?)  Of the King books I  have read so far, this was the least interesting to me of any.  You care  very little about the characters and the whole story is somewhat muddled  and confusing.  It reads fast for a long book but mainly because the story  is so uninteresting that you tend to breeze right through it.  I can't  recommend it.	2000-02-11

It was not quite as interesting a read as Heyerdahl's &quot;Kon-Tiki&quot; however.  It tends to focus on the natives currently living on the island more than those who  created the statues the island is famous for.  But, criticisms aside,  Heyerdahl proved again to be a very adept writer.	2000-02-01
