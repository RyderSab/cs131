IV)	Books	4	5	5	N	N	A Good Book for teens, but why such a long wait from the third one?	Chicken Soup for the Teenage Soul books are usually inspirational.  Teenagers can relate to their stories in ways unimaginable.  It's a great book for teens to read so that they know that they're normal.  It was why I read them when I was younger and why some stories still hold true today.<br /><br />It's great to pick up the fourth one.  More stories on love, relationships, friendships, family, and on the occasion, tough stuff.<br /><br />What I'm disappointed with is why it took so long to get the fourth one out.  It was a four year wait!  I loved the first three books, I could relate to them at the time of reading them.  Four years ago I was fourteen going on fifteen, those are some of the years where every teen really should read these books (it's the time of drama and the all time famous threat for suicide).  A teenager needs a book to let him/her know their life isn't all that bad, and that what happens to them really does happen to everyone else.<br /><br />The stories in this one, for those who were like me and read them as they came out, have no bearing anymore.  For older teenagers around seventeen to nineteen years old, like myself, the stories aren't nearly as inspirational as they could be anymore.  Part of it really IS due to it's late release.  Those of us who enjoyed the first three when they came out... have grown up!  Although, a part of me still yearns for teen stories because I went and picked this up, but I don't want to read a story and say to myself, \\"Been there done that.\\"  I want to read a story and say, \\"I can relate.\\"  That's lost in this compilation, and perhaps it's because I'm eighteen as opposed to fourteen.<br /><br />In short, the stories ARE good, but the older teen doesn't gain or learn from them.  As an older teen you probably already know.  I did enjoy the stories, though, for the sheer fact that I know the people who wrote them probably learned.  However, I can't help but express my disappointment that they lost the ability to touch me in the way they used to.<br /><br />For the younger teens this is gold found at the end of the rainbow.  Take it home and enjoy it.  For the teens who have been there since the beginning, the stories are gold, but not life changing anymore.  Either way, I recommend picking this up.  Each story is charming in it's own way.o.    For the younger teens this is gold found at the end of the rainbow.  Take it home and enjoy it.

In this day and age, a guide as detailed as this is fairly hard to come by.  Guides, recently have been lacking in the areas where they need the most strength.  They need walkthroughs and basics with detailed screenshots and maps.  Every now and then you really do get that decent strategy guide (like say... the BradyGAMES Kingdom Hearts Guide), but often you don't (like the Tales of Symphonia guide--see my review).<br /><br />Thank goodness that across seas there is Piggyback Interactive.  They don't release too many guides in America, but when they do you're glad to have 'em!  Nothing but the best information straight from the pros, with crystal-clear high rez screenshots and some of the most alarmingly detailed maps you could find! For their Jak 3 guide, they've more than outdone themselves.<br /><br />The guide opens up with a little talk about characters (and you'll see little blurbs pop up with Daxter \\"commenting\\" on these characters and whatnot), giving you some background information on them.<br /><br />We then break into the near 30 page game basics section.  There has never been a strategy guide that has been so useful and helpful in getting you acquainted with the game.  From telling you the basic controls to getting you able to use the vast set of weapons in Jak 2.  There are also advanced tips for advanced gamers, and that's one of the things that Piggyback is useful for.  The expert AND the beginner will get a use out of this guide!<br /><br />After the gamebasics you'll jump into the 100 page walkthrough!  That's right, 100 pages of in-depth strategy, high rez screenshots and detailed maps.  These maps aren't just handrawn maps either.  They come STRAIGHT from the developers so you KNOW they're detailed!  Beautifully rendered for your convenience and clearly marked with notes that will show you what to do.  Think of how Nintendo Power writes their guides with the A B C.  This guide is 1 2 3, and it works in divine ways.  This makes the guide more organized several times over!  No more reading the entire walkthrough just to find out what to do.  And what's better?  They actually tell you which screenshot you should look at!  For example: If you can't understand what's in the text they'll have in nice little parenthasis (See Fig. 1).  Now look at screenshot 1 and you'll know exactly what they're talking about!  Never has a guide been so clear and concise.<br /><br />The strategies detailed are not just from developers, but also from experts.  If you've seen any other piggyback guide (which for most of you will have been Halo 2, unless you import) you know they love to play through an area hundreds of times until they find the best route possible!  It is no different here, and they're willing to share those secrets with you!  And if you think that's boss, check out those boss strategies.  More than just two paragraphs, they take up the entire page and leave no stone unturned.<br /><br />Following the walkthrough is an enemies list that will tell you all you need to know about them including how fast they are, how big and how many hit points they've got!  Plus, insane secret beat down tactics!<br /><br />Speaking of secrets... this guide is chalk full of them.  With over 25 pages worth of secrets, what have you to lose?  Want to find all the Precursor Orbs?  You'll do it with this guide. How about all those nifty bonus challenges?  Revealed!  How about the precursor alphabet?  It's in here too!  Not one secret left out, and not stone left unturned!<br /><br />Following all those secrets is the making of Jak 3.  And not just the making of Jak 3, but the making of the entire Jak series starting with its cold roots back in the early days with \\"Jak and Daxter\\".  You'll get so much info out of the developers themselves.  Incredible!<br /><br />And lastly is the index.  Yes, there is an index, and trust me, you'll WANT this thing!  How many times are you tired of searching through the guides enemy list or you can't remember where to find that secret?  Well, instead of fishing through those sections skimming every page... why not just head to the index?  If every strategy guide had an index, page flipping would be less of a hazard (and the paper cut ratio might go down, even!).<br /><br />And if those maps are confusing, there is a fold-out legend so that you no longer will have to constantly flip to a legend.  Just fold it out and set your guide down and you're all set to go!<br /><br />So when is a strategy guide actually worth the outrageous price tag?  When you actually get everything from it.  Friends, this isn't just a strategy guide, it's an ENCYCLOPEDIA!  Is this worth shelling out the money for?  YES!  Totally worth it!<br /><br />So strap yourself into Jak 3 and use this as your navigation tool.  No stone left unturned, no secret left out.

Even for a young adult/teen book, I felt a little cheated when I had finished with Party Girl.  There was a certainl flare about the story that was missing.  Like a bike missing a wheel almost.<br /><br />Kata and Ana are best friends.  They're both members of a gang in the streets of LA (go figure...).  When Kata and Ana go dancing one night, Ana is shot and killed in a drive-by as the two make their way home.<br /><br />Kata, after losing her best friend, decides that then is the time to get out of the gang.  The murder of her best friend causes her to realize that she doesn't want to be a part of that life anymore.<br /><br />A simple story about how one is able to rise up in dark times and escape a life that inprisons them.  However, I felt cheated.  The story was so short that it was meaningless.  I can't understand why this is such a renowned book in young adult fiction.  We hardly get a chance to know these characters and connect with them.  Likewise, we never really learn anything about Ana's killer, other than that he was in a rival gang.  We don't even really meet this guy ever.<br /><br />Then there were the other supporting characters.  Ana's mother--a low life who is an alcoholic and has a different man over every week or so.  Your stereotypical gang mother it seems.<br /><br />The book was full of too many cliches.  It takes place in LA, which I was not too thrilled with (when is a gang story going to take place OUTSIDE LA or Chicago?), the mother of our protagonists is a horrible mom, and the inner struggles are the same thing we see on TV all the time.  Members wants out but doesn't know how.  And in the end when she finally DOES get out, she just walks away... just like that.  It can't be THAT easy, can it?<br /><br />Some stories were never finished.  We learn Ana had an affair with her boyfriend Pocho, but when Kata learns of this, she doesn't pursue Ana's killer at all.<br /><br />As the novella came to an end I began to care less and less about Kata.  Mostly I was wondering what the point Lynne Ewing was trying to make.  Then I was beginning to wonder why she didn't flesh the story out a little.  It felt like as she got closer and closer to the end she decided that nothing else was important other than getting Kata out of her sticky spot.  She didn't flesh out any of the characters (and that made most of them unlikeable) like Pocho.<br /><br />As the story crept closer and closer to what should've been an uplifting and satisfying ending, I felt as though I was watching a boring afterschool special.  I'm not upset with the ending, but the way it came together was fractured.  There was a special element to the book missing.  The in-depth story.<br /><br />Not the best book.  If it had been a little longer and more willing to flesh out the characters and subplot that formed along the way, it would've been better.  Young Adult books don't HAVE to be short like this (look at those Harry Potter books which are aimed for little kids, some are 800 pages long!), but if they are, they could make them simplar and not throw in so much that the reader is apt to ask questions about later.e less and less about Kata.

She watches her family grow up and apart and then later they come to live their lives again.<br /><br />As far as the book goes, there is no real central plot.  Some might say this is a very bad thing, but I ask you: what is plot?  How many of us actually read for plot?  Are we reading a book for plot or story?  The answer my friends is story.  And the Lovely Bones has a very enrichning storyline full of characters that will make you angry, and others that will make you smile.<br /><br />At first the story comes off as pretty blatant.  What's it all about?  What's the point of Susie watching the family.  But as the tale goes on it becomes clearer that this is not a story about finding Susie's murderer, but a story about where the home and the heart is.  A story about a grieving family that has to struggle through their own emotions to really become a family.  And Susie watches it all.  The collapse and reconstruction of her family over the years.<br /><br />Remarkably written, The Lovely Bones prose float off the page as literacy wonders, and soon become memorable lines in the reader's hearts.<br /><br />The story is a drama, full of emotion and a little bit of hope.  Alice Seabold does add a touch of humor to the story as well.  The story begins so horribly but then when you get to the end you realize just how uplifting the book really is.<br /><br />The Lovely Bones is a wonderful tale that accurately portrays the realities of death and grieving, as well as compassion and togetherness.  Now quite in the league of To Kill a Mockingbird, but certainly a joyful read nonetheless.	2005-08-29

His last few... umm... how many books has he released in the past few months?  Can't remember, but I read 'em, and they were all disappointing to me.  So when 4th of July appeared ont he bookshelf, I was reluctant to get it.  At first I thought, \\"I'll wait for the paperback edition,\\" but when I heard so many people telling me that it was better than what he'd done recently, I gave in and got it from a discount store.  And to be truthful, I was pleasantly surprised that to find the book to be one of Patterson's best work he's done in years.<br /><br />Lindsay Boxer, who recently lost a friend in 3rd Degree (a predictable loss, at that) she's been working another series of murders that involve the victim being electrocuted.  While off duty, she's having a few drinks with the girls when her former partner Jacobi calls and says they may have found her killer.  Lindsay takes a ride with Jacobi and car chase ensues.  When the criminals finally crash, Lindsay discovers that they're just kids.  As she tries to administer aid, the ruthless children (one fifteen, the other just blossoming into his teenage years) shoot her and her partner.  She goes down, and screams for them to drop their weapons.  They retort by firing more shots at her and so she is forced to fire back.  She ends up killing one of the children and paralyzing one for life.<br /><br />The father of the children decide to sue Lindsay Boxer, even though it's proven that those kids had done the murders.  The chief of Police decides to give Lindsay some \\"vacation\\" time, and so Lindsay takes off to her sisters house in Half Moon Bay, waiting for her trial date to come about.<br /><br />But in Half Moon Bay, another set of grisly murders is taking place, and they all relate to a case Lindsay had when she was just starting her career.  As she gets involved in the Half Moon Bay case, she puts her life in more danger by the minute, but doesn't care as long as she finds out who murdered her John Doe so long ago.<br /><br />It's a pretty riveting story, fast paced with a lot of intense moments.  Surprisingly though, there aren't nearly as many twist as we're used to from Patterson.  But most things run along smoothly in the novel.<br /><br />However, the reason I gave it four and half is simply that at some points things move TOO fast.  Lindsay's trial is covered in a series of maybe ten or so chapters (if you haven't read Patterson before, you need to know that his chapters are VERY VERY short, usually a page or two).  The thril also doesn't last as long.  I was more interested in what Lindsay was doing to relax rather than what she was going to about the killer.  However, I was very glad to see that the villian wasn't some comic-book villian like we've seen in the past couple of Alex Cross novels.<br /><br />You should have no problem finding a stopping point with only 400 pages and 146 chapters (most of which are only two pages long).  Still, you should be able to knock the book out in two or three sittings.  It isn't overly difficult, as most Patterson books aren't.<br /><br />I'm sure the pacing is a minor problem, but sometimes some parts went by so fast that we really didn't get to know the characters enough.  It became so condensed that sooner or later Lindsay was the only character that mattered.  What about the two children she shot?  Nothing.  What about the killer?  Not much on him either.  We're so busy being stuck in Lindsay's world that the other characters come off as flat.  Had it not been for the past three novels, we probably wouldn't have known anything about the other members of the Women's Murder Club.<br /><br />Overall though, if you're looking for a good thrill ride, pick up the 4th of July by James Patterson and Maxine Paetro.  It's apt to entertain you and keep you ont he edge of your seat with it's cultivating plot and moving main character, Lindsay Boxer.s out who murdered her John Doe so long ago.   <br /> <br />It's a pretty riveting story, fast paced with a lot of intense moments.

Not a bad read, but not up to King's best	A lot of people will, no doubt, express that this is one of the best King books around.  The premise of it is very good, but it feels, at times, rather bland and boring.  In fact, what happens outside of the terror is ultimately more interesting than what happens within the terror.<br /><br />Cujo is a St. Bernard.  A friendly dog who innocently chases a rabbit into a hole and gets attacked by the bats within.  One manages to land a well placed scratch on him that causes the dog to be become rabid.  The Trenton family is also having troubles.  Tad Trenton is scared of the monster in his closet and Vic and Donna are dealing with a car in desperate need of repairs as well as Donna's affair with a strange man named Steve Kemp.<br /><br />So one day while Vic has to go on a business trip Donna and Tad decide to take the car in to get repairs.  Unfortunately the man in charge of the shop has been killed by Cujo, and they're unable to leave because the car completely dies on them.  A rabid dog is outside, and waiting for them.<br /><br />And that sums up the main plot of Cujo.  To be honest there are actually maybe three stories in one rolled up in here.  The above synopsis described as well as Vic trying to save his job and the Cambers--who own Cujo--trying to reconcile family differences.<br /><br />There is a sense of fear in this book, at least.  This book, much like other books (\\"Misery\\" for example) feel all too real, which is good.  Unfortunately, the areas where it doesn't seem real are what get me.<br /><br />The characters, for some reason, feel rather lifeless.  At least in terms of whether or not we should care about them.  Unlike other characters King has developed, these ones are not very likeable.  Sadly enough, Cujo may be the most interesting character of the lot.  And that's only because for a brief period of time we see the world through his eyes (reading prose like, \\"he didn't want to be a BADDOG\\").<br /><br />Also, the situation just seems surreal at times.  The way everything falls into place seems like one coincidence after another.  Such as how the major characters other than Donna and Tad happen to be out of town, and the Mailman gets cut off.  Stuff like that.<br /><br />Finally, you just can't help that the book feels overly long.  Perhaps it's because King felt we'd be bored to death just reading about a mother and her son trapped in her car.  This seems to be the reason why he has so many subplots (the affair, Vic having to save the account, the Camber families troubles).  Sadly, however, it's much more fun to read about Vic and the other characters than it is to read about Donna and Tad being inprisoned in the car by a rabid dog.  This makes the book feel longer than it has to be at times.<br /><br />It's an enjoyable read.  One that I'm sure any fan of Stephen King or horror will really enjoy.  The book just has a tendency to drag.  It's stimulating, and to some extent horrifying, but it feels like reading a book by a writer trying to break into the market.  In other words, it's not Stephen King's best.  Nothing as shattering as \\"The Stand\\" here.<br /><br />But read it.  If not for the love of horror or Stephen King, then just to pass the time.

But when he writes something outside of horror (The Green Mile, Different Seasons, The Dark Tower series) they're sometimes better.  The Dead Zone is no exception.<br /><br />The Dead Zone begins with our protagonists Johnny Smith encountering an accident on the ice in 1953 when he's just five or six years old.  This incident begins his series of \\"flashes\\" where he can see certain things before they happen.<br /><br />Later,in the year 1970, Johnny gets involved in a car accident that puts him in a coma for four years.  A lot happens in those four years, and Stephen King will touch on just about all of it.  There's a man named Greg Stillson running around becoming a member of the house of represenatives, a series of grisly murders that runs rampant, and of course, The Watergate Scandal happened.  When Johnny comes out of the coma in 1974 he's exposed to the changes of his world.  His recovery is miraculous, but now his power has increased.  By a single touch of your hand, or a photo--some sort of possession--Johnny can learn things about you.  He helps his doctor find his mother, a nurse find out her house is catching fire.<br /><br />All this doesn't go without media attention, and Johnny gets it.  As he tries to evade the media, and control his power, he begins getting packages of people wanting to know things about their loved ones because Johnny is \\"psychic\\".  What Johnny can't explain is when he sees something but not the whole picture.  A truth that could be prevented that gets lost in what he calls \\"The Dead Zone.\\"<br /><br />He helps a police officer catch a murderer, and when he meets Greg Stillson, he learns that in many many years (possibly 1992) Greg is going to send America straight to hell in a nuclear war.  It's up to Johnny to prevent this from happening, but he doesn't know all the details because some of it is lost in \\"The Dead Zone\\".<br /><br />Stephen King is known for making good characters who are well-rounded, witty, and often remind us of people we meet in our lifetime.  Johnny Smith is no different.  He's a clever witty character who is always trying to do the right thing.  As he comes to discover his power he can't find out if it's a God Given Gift, or if it's God Given Curse.  Either way he utilizes the power.<br /><br />There will be plenty of moments when The Dead Zone keeps you on the edge of your seat.  You'll wonder if Johnny can actually prevent some of the things that will happen.  Stephen King actually does a great job of keeping this random.  Because Johnny will see some things that we \\"know\\" he's powerless to stop, but he does anyway in ways that he's not even sure.<br /><br />If you want a little break from all the horror that Stephen King presents, then strap yourself into The Dead Zone and enjoy the ride of this psychological thriller.

They also point out a few basic tips that any soul gamer probably wouldn't have tried out.<br /><br />The section about the sphere grid is nifty, but this brings me to my first thing to point out.  This FFX guide, is for the INTERNATIONAL version, as well as the standard version.  America got the Standard Version and Europe got both versions.  So there is also detail on the Expert Sphere Grid.  It isn't as BIG as the one in the BradyGAMES guide, but you can still use it.<br /><br />Each character section is also detailed with how that character should act in combat.  I would've really liked to have seen what they're section of the sphere grid looks like though, but I could do without.<br /><br />The walkthrough is VERY detailed, helping you to get everything.  The maps, for those who are curious, are about the same as they were in the BradyGAMES guide.  But the walkthrough brings details to your attention that you would've never known.  The walkthrough does tend to digress though, and they always feel the need to bring you up to speed.  What does that mean?  Plot spoilers.  Quite a few of them too, but seeing as how I've already been through the game, I don't care. The boss strategies are very helpful, but again, there were some things BradyGAMES did that this guide didn't.  BradyGAMES told me how much damage I had to do to get an overkill in the walkthrough, this guide forces you to flip to the back of the book.  BradyGAMES also showed overkill AP you'd receive.  With this, you have to flip to the back of the book.<br /><br />The Bestiary in this guide is more complex than any other guide.  Easy to use, but the info is all over the place.  The most basic of basic info points itself out, but some of the other things you might want to know (AP you'll receive, etc.) is somewhat tucked away at the bottom of each monster.<br /><br />The Blitzball section is about the only major problem I had with the guide.  It goes so into the game it isn't even funny.  You should be able to survive a pop quiz on blitzball after reading this book.  The problem is, they don't say anything about the characters.  Who can I recruit?  What benefits come from recruiting them?  In the BradyGAMES guide they told me the stats for EVERY player.<br /><br />Lastly, the secrets.  There are actually quite a few secrets pointed out here that the BradyGAMES guide didn't tell us.  For example, if you want to know how to unlock all the monsters in the monster arena, and what their stats look like, then this guide is the one you want!  You'll go into every battle prepared, and they give strategies for some of the harder monsters.  They also give you a nice little AP trick that'll help your characters gain sphere levels faster than you ever thought possible.<br /><br />I must remind you again, this guide also covers the INTERNATIONAL version, which had more secrets and goodies than the standard version.  This guide talks about all the \\"Dark\\" aeons, and a hidden boss named Penance.  In the standard American Version the Dark Aeons and Penance DON'T EXIST!  So the guide isn't \\"giving out wrong info\\", it's just for a different version of the game.<br /><br />Is it better than the BradyGAMES guide?  Yes, for the sake of the monster arena alone.  If you truly want to find everything FFX has to offer, then pick up this guide instead.  You'll have to import it though, and that'll cost you a hefty amount.  Still an awesome guide.verkill AP you'd receive.  With this, you have to flip to the back of the book.  <br /> <br />The Bestiary in this guide is more complex than any other guide.

OK, Piggyback Interactive is a company from the UK.  They have a really big reputation there.  They do a much better job than Prima and Bradygames do, giving you high quality guides with tons of info and crystal clear high-rez screenshots.  This guide, is probably one of the greatest Final Fantasy guides ever written.  You thought the VERSUS BOOKS FFVII guide was good?  Wait until you see this one, it blows the Versus Books FFVII guide out of the water!  And that's saying a lot.<br /><br />The guide is incredibly colorful.  Each section giving you a list of all the items, maps and location of all the draw points.  Each section is also written with amazing detail!  It's almost like the guide is talking to you.<br /><br />The characters section and items section is also brutally detailed.  You'll learn so much about the game it isn't even funny.  The bestiary is also more concise and to the point.  Honestly, who picked up the Bradygames guide and had to flip back just to learn what all the symbols mean?  Much more or less who cared to use the bestiary in the Brady guide?  It was so confusing and error riddled that it wasn't worth it.  Not here.  This bestiary throws less at you.  By that I mean, only the basics.  Where to find them, weakness and average HP for the basic changing levels (meaning when you draw different spells).  Much easier to follow.<br /><br />Also, it is possible to find all the cards and unearth every secret without giving anything valueable to the plot.  This guide is spoiler free.  Alongside you'll also uncover all the limit breaks and weapons.<br /><br />There are a few drawbacks to the guide however.<br /><br />For one, the Bestiary isn't in alphabetical order.  It seems to be done based on when you run into the monster.  This can be very annoying if you want quick info on what you can steal, items, weakness, etc.  Not a big deal since the enemies level up, but what if you're desperate to know their weakness and you don't have a scan spell?<br /><br />Also, the abilities and such is equally confusing.  These list are also randomized.  It comes to the point where it's annoying to find abilities.  You'll find all the abilities and such on the list, but you'll spend one hell of a time searching through it all.<br /><br />Finally, while items are listed in the walkthrough, they're not always called out on the map. I don't think this is a problem (especially if you could utilize the Bradygames guide, which had maps in the back of the book).<br /><br />The problems are minor, and for that I gave it a five.  It's probably the best Final Fantasy Guide out there.  Nothing is left uncovered.  If you can actually find this guide (via ebay or import from amazon.co.uk), pick it up.<br /><br />Good job Piggyback!a scan spell? <br /> <br />Also, the abilities and such is equally confusing.

Some people don't find a need for this guide, and that's fine, but that doesn't mean others won't need it.  Secondly, those who keep saying \\"Go online, go online, go online,\\" seem to have forgotten two things.  One: There are people who want the information in their lap and don't have a computer right next to their gaming system.  The second is simple, some people are more visual learners.  They learn the game by using maps and screenshots.  For some, text just doesn't cut it.  Using online guides is fine, but remember when you review a strategy guide you should actually be REVIEWING THE GUIDE, not blabbering whether or not one should use an online guide (if they wanted an online guide, do you think they'd waste time coming to Amazon to buy it?).<br /><br />Anyway, with that out of my system, let's move on.  Piggyback Interactive, for those who don't know, is a guide company in the UK.  The moment you pick up one of their guides you'll be blown away!  If you thought VERSUS BOOKS was good (before they went out of business) allow Piggyback to correct you.<br /><br />The guide begins with over 50 pages of game basics.  This means getting you to learn the controls, weapons, vehicles and enemies before actually diving into the walkthrough.  For newcomers to Halo 2, this is a lifesaver.<br /><br />The walkthrough is pretty detailed as well.  They actually tell you a couple of differences between difficulty levels.  You really have to utilize the maps though (which are vastly detailed beyond anything Prima, Brady, Versus, or even Nintendo Power put out).  It's a guide that is written in the sense of, find the corresponding number in the text.  In other words, if a \\"1\\" is marked on the map, find section \\"1\\" in the text.<br /><br />The secrets also tell you all you need to know, and should there be a spoiler, they alert you before moving on.<br /><br />Of course, even this guide has it's problems.  For one, the maps are ridiculously cluttered, and there are too many symbols to remember.  It's a good thing they have a fold out legend.  Second, while the secrets are in-depth they didn't pin-point out easter eggs.  And lastly (and this isn't a big one) there is just too much artwork taking up space where valuble text could've been.  I don't say this to be funny, I say this because this guide weighs a ton with it's thick paper and all.<br /><br />A fantastic guide though.  If you can, log on and import piggyback interactive guides.  If you need a guide for Kingdom Hearts, Final Fantasy X (or better yet, get their FFIX guide, NO PLAYONLINE THERE!), Metal Gear Solid 3 and the like, get Piggyback.  You won't be disappointed.ridiculously cluttered, and there are too many symbols to remember.  It's a good thing they have a fold out legend.

There are times when people want to buy a strategy guide to get a leg up.  Afterall, unlike most online guides they have maps and screenshots for us visual learners who can't learn by text alone.  Unfortunately, the problem with being a visual learner with strategy guides, is when those guides are missing a lot of stuff.  If this were a guide for an action/adventure game, it would be perfect.  But RPG guides are supposed to be better than this.<br /><br />To begin, let us first understand what a strategy guide is.  It is NOT meant to be a \\"How-to\\" book.  It's meant to be just what it is: A guide.  Some things the guide really shouldn't have to point out to you (does the guide really have to say which direction is North on the worldmap?  It's on display in the game for cryin' out loud!).  Unfortunately, while this guide is helpful, it seems far from being complete.<br /><br />The walkthrough is basic.  It's written to where you should only refer to it if you're stuck.  It's a quick easy to use walkthrough.  I didn't have any troube understanding puzzle solutions (if the writing is confusing, just look at the screenshot, easy as that).  I also didn't have any trouble being guided in the next direction.  It seems like it's done it's job right?  Afterall, all the EX skills and Techs are in the guide, and they're covered pretty well in an easy to use table.  Items list, weapons charts, all the neat misc. stuff is here.<br /><br />But there are problems.<br /><br />The writing, as the others have pointed out, is confusing sometimes.  Some paragraphs really DO end abruptly.  And there are instances of them being none finished, but here's the trick to that.  When a paragraph isn't finished, it means the next few words are the title of the next section.  A technique BradyGAMES must've picked up from Versus Books along the road.  It doesn't work though, as you can clearly see by the other reviewers who didn't seem to spot this sooner.<br /><br />The walkthrough has more problems.  An RPG guide NEEDS MAPS!  I'll shout it from the roof-tops until the day I die!  Without maps, an RPG guide is damn near useless.  Where are the treasures?  I don't know because the guide doesn't have maps!  You'll have to rely on directions, and they don't even lead you to all the items.  The good news is there IS an items list for each area.<br /><br />Also, what's with the bestiary?  I understand that it goes by the monster list in the game, but if it were alphabetical, it would've been easier to use.  If you encounter an enemy for the first time, you'll have to flip through endless pages to find the enemy you want.  More importantly, why aren't monster stats called out in the walkthrough?  They are for bosses, but not regular enemies.<br /><br />And let's talk about boss strategies for a moment.  I've never seen a guide with such horrendous strategies before.  Here's a boss strategy from one of the late bosses in the game.  I can put it right here!<br /><br />\\"Use ice, water, or fire attacks to defeat the monster, in combination with physical attacks and techs.\\"<br /><br />Now, what did you learn?  Weakness?  Yeah.  But what about what the boss attacks with?  What about what YOUR characters need to defend against?  Does the boss cast status effects?  Nobody knows!<br /><br />Finally, there's no affections list.  One of the most crucial parts of the story and character development, and the guide doesn't help you with it.  What choices do I make for my characters to like me?  Hell, I don't know.<br /><br />I liked the side-quest sectin.  Very detailed, but I wish they'd call them out in the walkthrough.  I had a case of page-flipping after damn near every completed area just to see if a side-quest was availible.  I'd waste precious game time (and some life) just seeing if a quest was availible.<br /><br />Seriously though, this isn't the worst guide in the world.  If you need help with the main quest, it WILL help you.  You just have to make really good useof those screenshots and tips.  The tips DO work, and you will find all the titles, EX Skills and obtain all the techs using this guide.  You won't master the game with the guide, but you'll come close in more ways than you think.  The only MAJOR problem with the guide is the Character affection and lack of maps.  Other than that, you should be just fine with this guide.You just have to make really good use of those screenshots and tips.

One of the best RE4 resources you'll ever need.  This guide is jam-packed with all the secrets and strategies you need to conquer Resident Evil 4.  With the help of game developers, BradyGAMES has produced one of the best RE guides ever!<br /><br />Resident Evil 4 is a complex game.  It's new targeting system, and far more threatening enemies will take time to get used to.  Luckily, this guide has the lowdown on all of them.  They help you to understand the new system, and get used to the new motives that RE4 introduces, such as it's interactive movie sequences.<br /><br />The guide gives all the low down on enemies and weapons.  You'll know what works, and what doesn't.  Easily, this makes this guide pretty handy.<br /><br />The walkthrough is perhaps the best part of the entire guide.  The maps are detailed, pointing out where all the items are.  They'll even tell you where random items appear.  Before each section there is also an items list so that you don't have to explore through all the maps just to see what items are in an area.  They're also nice enough to tell you what enemies you're apt to run into in an area.<br /><br />The strategies presented in the walkthrough are some of the best.  They tell you WHEN you should grab certain weapons (and what happens if you grab it beforehand), they recommend when to buy stuff, and when to sell it, and they keep you one step ahead of the monsters.  The boss strategies will ensure that you stay alive.  They'll tell you how to avoid one-hit kills, and what weapons deal the best damage.<br /><br />Finally, once you get to chapter five, the guide explains that the game adjust the difficulty based on your inventory.  So if you're not picking up the items the guide points out, they've explained why.<br /><br />The secrets, and mini-games are incredible.  You'll figure out how to unlock all the hidden characters, and the importance of beginning a new game.  Easily, this is the best RE guide BradyGAMES has ever put out.<br /><br />Is it worth the money?  I'd say so.  If you need a leg up, you'll need this guide.  It won't steer you wrong either.

Of course it's perfect, it's Nintendo Power.  As someone who collects strategy guides, I often tend to get a hold of even the guides I don't need.  You shouldn't need a guide for Metroid Zero Mission, but if you find yourself stuck, there's no reason why this one can't help you.  The walkthrough is perfect, the secrets divine and the illustrations are grand.<br /><br />The guide isn't very big, which is okay because Metroid Zero isn't a very big game.  We begin with all those game basics because some people won't read the manuel, so the guide has you covered.  They have all the items you'll obtain and the powerups in this section as well.<br /><br />Then we have a quick map appendix.  This is NOT meant to be a guide through the game.  These maps are simply for those who want to find all the powerups.  They even label which page you need to turn to to figure out how to get it.<br /><br />It's the walkthrough that makes this guide incredible.  Anyone who has the Metroid Fusion guide will know the basic layout.  The maps each have a number at each important location.  That same number is called in the text, and it tells you what to do.  The boss strategies are simple and easy to follow (it isn't like Metroid Zero Mission is a hard game anyway).<br /><br />Once we get past the walkthrough the game takes you into an expert way of going through the game.  By that I mean they give you the lowdown of the 15% Mission Completion and a Speed Walkthrough.  Now of course, those expecting a map for the 15% completion must be crazy!  After all, the guide assumes you'll attempt the 15% Challenge and Speed Walkthrough after you've already mastered the game.  They work though, so don't worry so much.<br /><br />Now, the Golden part of the guide.  When you unlock the original Metroid, this guide has a walkthrough for it!  I know it sounds strange, but the first Metroid was a gem (and I enjoyed playing the classic Metroid much more than Zero Mission).  To have a walkthrough handy was perfect. Of course, if you already have the Metroid Prime Guide by Nintendo Power, you won't really need the walkthrough for the original Metroid here (it's the exact same thing).<br /><br />The guide also tells you how to get all the endings.<br /><br />Really, while it isn't needed, the guide is absolutely perfect.  If you get stuck, this guide will help you out.  You really shouldn't need it though.through handy was perfect.

Nintendo Power is known for producing high quality guides for their Nintendo Systems.  It's no different when it comes to Star Fox Adventures.  This is a high quality guide, but there are some moments where I look at it and wonder why they presented it the way they did.<br /><br />I'm assuming we all know Nintendo Power makes excellent guides here.  I have no complaints about the information in the walkthrough.  This is from the people who made the game so you kow all the info is correct.  The maps are very detailed (though I believe VERSUS BOOKS had better maps, but try finding THAT guide), pointing out all the items and puzzle solutions.  The boss strategies are pretty good, and they don't really spoil the game for you.<br /><br />The problem with the guide of course is simple.  The walkthrough.  Yes, it's a great walkthrough, but jumping back and forth in the walkthrough is insane.  You go from reading the opening pages of the walkthrough to jumping to page 80 something, and then back to around page 14, and then to page 90 something.  Why couldn't they just make a linear walkthrough that didn't require all this flipping around?  I understand they have it organized by what area of the game you're in, but I could've gone without all the page flipping.  All the other guides have linear walkthroughs that work.  This guide does not, and it became really annoying after a while because I'm used to a linear walkthrough.<br /><br />It's a great guide, almost perfect.  I just couldn't let it slide with a five with how the walkthrough was presented.  It'll get you through the game no problem, but you'll have to constantly jump multitudes of pages, and back to other pages over and over again.  I don't need that from a guide.  I need information that's quick and easy to find without having to flip through a million pages just to find it.<br /><br />It'll help you out, so grab it.  If not, grab any of the other guides as they're pretty good too.	2005-05-19

When VERSUS BOOKS was out making some of the best guides ever (Resident Evil 2, Metal Gear Solid, The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, and of course, they're highly sought Final Fantasy VII guide), they made a guide to Pokemon Yellow.  This guide blew EVERY other guide out of the water with it's enriched detail, in-depth Pokedex and Secrets that not even Nintendo Power shared with gamers!<br /><br />All the stuff before the walkthrough--the basics and such--will help any newcomers get adjusted to the game in the most user friendly way.  They give you the basics on capturing, raising, and what type should go up against what type.<br /><br />The walkthrough is where this guide shines the most!  If you ever get a guide to Pokemon Yellow, make it this one simply because the walkthrough is more precise and in-depth than any other guide.  The walkthrough is written a lot like the acclaimed Final Fantasy VII guide.  For each area they list all the Pokemon available (they're sorted by version as well), they have detailed maps.  The best part about the walkthrough was that they told you the pokemon roster for EVERY TRAINER IN THE GAME!  You'd always know what you were getting yourself into thanks to VERSUS BOOKS.<br /><br />When it came to Gym Leaders and the like, the guide wasn't as helpful.  Luckily though, all you need is a roster to know how to take on Gym Leaders.<br /><br />After the walkthrough comes the Pokedex.  Anyone who has seen any other Pokemon guide knows that VERSUS BOOKS makes one helluva a Pokedex, detailing all the stats, moves, TMs, HMs and where to catch them at in each version.

When it comes to some guides, BradyGAMES doesn't slouch.  If you look at guides like their Final Fantasy X guide and their Star Ocean: Till the End of Time, you know they make some good guides, trying to please the customer.  Sometimes, however, they DO slouch, and when they do, it isn't pretty.  Unfortunately, since the coming of their Signature Series, they've slouched a lot.  Unless a guide is a part of the Signature Series, you're risking a lot by buying it.  Sadly, this guide is not a Signature Series guide so you know they didn't take it seriously.<br /><br />It seems as though the staff assumes that people who buy this guide have already played the original Metal Gear Solid on PSX.  It's chalk full of spoilers!  They even mention this on the first page.  They also encourage you to use the guide only when you're stuck.<br /><br />It is kind of cool that the first few pages of the guide tell you all the differences between the original version and this one, but that seems to be there to take up space.  The game basics is also grand, but I wish they'd tell us the differences between game modes.  The walkthrough, for those of you who don't know how a BradyGAMES MGS guide works, is written based on the \\"Normal\\" difficulty setting.<br /><br />The walkthrough is where you get the biggest mix.  I can't figure out if the author thought the people playing the game were retarded or not.  In one spot the text even reads \\"Switch to First Person View, hold down the A button to raise the SOCOM Pistol..\\" as if we don't know the A Button fires a weapon (and if you don't know that, you're playing the wrong game).  The walkthrough is also sluggish, especially in the beginning.  It picks up, perhaps a little too much.  The boss strategies are not all that helpful for example, they don't mention that when fighting the M1 Tank or Metal Gear REX, you can use Chaff Grenades to jam the radar.<br /><br />The walkthrough did have its good points though.  The maps are VERY detailed and pin-point out items.  They also show guard patrol routes, although some are confusing (way too many arrows on some pages, the way they did the guard route in the MGS2 and MGS3 guide was much better).  The screenshots were clear enough, and they did lead you through each area OK.<br /><br />However, I'd say the biggest problem with this guide is simple.  Who would need it?  Especially if you played through the original MGS on the PSX?  The changes made to the game are so minimal (and they did a bit of tweaking to the game, such as for Psycho Mantis to do EVERYTHING he did on the PSX version you have to play on EXTREME) that you should already know everything about it.<br /><br />It's also sad that for all the secrets you have to go fishing through the walkthrough.  I was also disappointed that, as usual, BradyGAMES wouldn't get to the point.  They take time to explain every cutscene to you.  For the love of God, I'm playing the game, and watching the cutscene, why does the guide have to explain it to me?  Does the author really think I'm that dense that I can't watch a simple cutscene?<br /><br />They did have a dog tags list, and they did have a list for all the spirits.  Sadly, they didn't bother to explain game rankings, and they even ruin the ending for those who have yet to play through MGS for the first time.<br /><br />My advice is this, unless you collect strategy guides, leave this one on the shelf.  The game, for one thing, is so simple to figure out that you really shouldn't need it.  Also, if you've already played the original on PSX, you'd be wasting your money by buying it anyway.

US	48278407	R163Y2CQLZ2OVE	0446532436	967980395	True Believer	Books	4	2	3	N	N	A Good story overall, but not up to his best.	Nicholas Sparks has presented some pretty good love stories in the past (\\"A Walk to Remember\\"), and some he's even thrown in some thrills for the reader (\\"The Guardian\\").  \\"True Believer\\" seems to go back to the \\"miracle\\" theme started in \\"The Notebook\\".  While it's a great story, there are some moments when you're disappointed.<br /><br />Jeremy Marsh is your typical New York Journalist.  He lives in the big apple exposing fraud psychics all over the world.  He travels a lot, and writes for a column called \\"Scientific America\\".  Jeremy doesn't believe in psychics or miracles, and he makes it clear when he gets a spot on Primetime Live to talk about it.<br /><br />After his appearance on TV, he gets a letter from the small town of Boone Creek North Carolina, talking about ghosts and spirits in the small town cemetary.  Jeremy, already sure it isn't real, packs up and heads to Boone Creek.<br /><br />Once Jeremy arrives in the small town, things get too weird for him.  First he meets Doris at a cafe.  Doris claims she's a psychic who can predict what sex your baby will be, and of course Jeremy doesn't believe her.  He has no interest in hearing about Doris's abilities.<br /><br />But he does have an interest in Doris's granddaughter Lexie at the local library.  As Jeremy spends time trying to unearth the mystery of the cemetary, he finds himself caring less about the mystery, and more about Lexie.<br /><br />Likewise, Lexie doesn't want to have anything to do with Jeremy, but then she starts thinking of him more and more and more.  There's no question about it, they're in love.  But Jeremy will soon have to go back to New York, and Lexie already feels lonely enough.  Somehow, they'll have to make it work, and that in itself would be a miracle.<br /><br />Nicholas Sparks is known for creating strong characters, and this is no exception.  Jeremy is a strong willed character, and Lexie is probably more interesting to learn about than him.  The problem of course is that Lexie is your stereotypical lonely girl.  She's scared of another relationship because she's had bad experiences in the past.<br /><br />Likewise, Jeremy is your stereotypical workaholic man who can't keep a steady relationship.  He's been married once, and because of his journalism, he couldn't keep her.<br /><br />But while the roles are stereotypical, the characters are real at least.  They blend and come together in a humanlike way.  Sometimes the characters feel a little too real.<br /><br />When it comes to the love story portion, it's got a good sense of humor to keep you going further into the story.  It makes it so it isn't boring, and it goes by smoothly.<br /><br />What I really didn't like about the story were some of the blatent cliches.  This is what I mean when I say it's perhaps a little too realistic.  Jeremy and Lexie have their fight, and it's a lot like watching a husband and wife fight (or for children, watching their parents fight).  I began to want Sparks to spare me some of the drama.  It didn't help much in keeping the mystery of the story going either.<br /><br />I began to grow enticed by the love story, but I was more interested in how Jeremy solves the mystery.  When he DID solve it, I was disappointed.  Not only that, but the whole \\"fight\\" left me rolling my eyes.<br /><br />However, as the story comes to an end, it gets better again.  While the \\"fight\\" is nothing special, the aftermath of it is.  It's tender, tear-jerking, and makes you understand that being a \\"believer\\" has nothing to do with psychics, ghosts and the like.  Being a believer has to do with miracles.<br /><br />It's a good book.  It has a moment where it begins to go down with all the cliches, but it picks up again and soars.

Nights in Rodanthe is a short, almost meaningless love story centering on the middle-aged workaholic man, and the middle-aged woman whose husband left her for a younger woman.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong.  I love Nicholas Sparks.  His books are among my favorites, but Nights in Rodanthe feels like it's written by a different man sometimes.  Is this really the guy who wrote \\"The Notebook\\" and \\"A Walk to Remember\\"?<br /><br />Adrienne Willis, is a forty-five year old woman who has been abandoned by her husband for a younger woman.  Her best friend has to leave town for a while, and so she's been asked to take care of the hotel in the small town of Rodanthe.<br /><br />Paul Flanner is a man who works too hard, and his wife left him because he was just too absorbed in his work.  Paul swore to her that he could change, and she says in the cliched lines \\"I know you can, but I want you to change because you want to,\\" or something like that.  We've heard it a million times.<br /><br />Really, this is a short read.  You should be able to finish it in one sitting (it's about as long as \\"The Notebook\\").  Believe me, this is a love or hate it book.<br /><br />I'll start with the obvious, the character developement.  Nicholas Sparks is a master of character development.  What happened here?  Paul Flanner is pretty flat, and unlike his past books (I'm referring mostly to \\"A Walk to Remember\\") the characters don't come together in a way you'd want them to.  In fact, they seem to come together too fast, and too late into the book.  We don't learn too much about Paul, and we spend so much time just watching him live his normal days not doing much of anything.<br /><br />Adrienne is no different.  We spend so much time learning about what she does during her day.  For the Love of God, I buy a Nicholas Sparks for a LOVE STORY!  This book is only two hundred pages, but the love story is almost absent from the book entirely.<br /><br />I'm not too big on the cliche's, but because of it's lack of a love story, the book comes off as boring.  Slow paced books can be good (have you read Stephen King's \\"The Shining\\"?), but sometimes a book that's a little faster wouldn't hurt, especially if it's one as short as this.  It should be able to get to the point much faster, instead of having us learn so many character traits that don't really mean anything to the story.<br /><br />Although, Sparks' does still have that tear-jerking emotion that he's famous for.  You might not cry after this book, but you'll put it down still believing that love can blossom anywhere.<br /><br />I like Nicholas Sparks, I really do.  But when I see stories like this from a master of love stories... I get sad.  If this is your first Sparks' book, I suggest you read \\"A Walk to Remember\\" or \\"The Notebook\\".  They're far better than this, and they're tender and loving.e cliche's, but because of it's lack of a love story, the book comes off as boring.

US	48278407	R2EIO5000PLSK1	0671039741	165977133	'Salem's Lot	Books	4	1	1	N	N	Good until the end	'Salem's Lot.  Stephen King's second novel and it far surpasses his first novel \\"Carrie\\".  Not as good as some of his later works, but this is a King classic that should be read by any Stephen King fan.  To read 'Salem's Lot is to understand why Stephen King is a master of his craft.<br /><br />'Salem's Lot is a small New England town in the middle of Maine.  The small innocent kind of town where everyone knows everyone, and everyone is friends with everyone.  Everybody knows everything in 'Salem's Lot, right up to the abandoned Marsten House in town.  One day out of the blue, someone buys the Marsten House.  At the same time, a writer named Ben Mears is visiting 'Salem's Lot to write a book about.  Soon, however, strange occurances happen.  People start disappearing in the night, and the darkness of the Marsten House comes to life as the inhabitants of 'Salem's Lot finally realize their town is slowly being taken over by vampires.<br /><br />The book is written in a form that takes a while to get used to.  For one, each chapter also has subchapters.  Also, part of reading 'Salem's Lot, is getting to know 'Salem's Lot.  As the book begins we're slowly introduced to the inhabitants of the Lot.  This, I felt, was one of the books flaws.  We're introduced to several characters, but most of them play no role in the story.  It's nice to get to know 'Salem's Lot, but what is the point in spending so much time to develop a character that doesn't do anything, or play any role in the story at all?  Let alone remained unmentioned for the rest of the book?  It happened.<br /><br />There were some bone-chilling moments in 'Salem's Lot.  The book DOES pace slow, but you'll quickly forgive that once the rollar coaster starts.  Some moments were down right creepy, while others were just gruesome.<br /><br />The only other flaw in this book that I found was the ending.  It wasn't a bad ending, but after giving so much build up, I was expecting a showdown between the Vampires and the survivors of 'Salem's Lot.  Instead we get all that build up for... well... nothing.<br /><br />'Salem's Lot is a very good book.  It blows \\"Carrie\\" out of the water and is truly one of King's best works.  If it weren't for the ending I'd give this a five-star rating.<br /><br />A worthwhile read, and it should keep you on the edge of your seat.Vampires and the survivors of 'Salem's Lot.

The only good thing about this guide is the arts list for each character.  That's about the only help you'll really get from it.<br /><br />Compared to other RPG guides, Prima's \\"Legend of Legaia\\" guide is shallow.  Where are the maps? The comprehensive items lists? The bestiary?  The secrets?  They're all absent from this guide.<br /><br />The walkthrough was perhaps the worst part.  There's nothing but text and screenshots.  Some screens are in the wrong place, and I began to wonder how exactly anyone could get anything from this guide.  There were no maps, and they didn't mention the items I could obtain in an area.  They mention items on the way to the target, but never anything off the beaten path.<br /><br />Then there were the boss strategies.  They had HP listings for some of them.  Other times they either didn't have HP listed or they said something like \\"He has around 13,000 HP\\" which in turn doesn't tell me a whole lot.  At least some of the strategies were good, but they didn't mention the basic tip you give anyone who goes at Legend of Legaia.  You heal almost every turn (even at GameFAQs they mention that in nearly every FAQ).<br /><br />The guide was also absent of basic enemy information.  Where was the bestiary?  What could I steal from the enemy?  What did the enemy drop?  Better yet, WHAT ENEMIES WILL I RUN INTO IN A CERTAIN AREA?  The guide doesn't say.<br /><br />Then there are the appendices in the back.  They had a list of seru magic (not very handy, we know what enemies are seru just by looking for a symbol next to them in the game) and an accessories list.  The accessories list and whatnot were out of order.  There WAS an items list, but again: out of order.  They could've at least put it in alphabetical order to make it easier.  Secrets items (such as the Chicken Heart, and Chicken King) got little or no mention at all.<br /><br />The entire guide read like an FAQ... only with screenshots.  Seriously, if you want to MASTER Legend of Legaia, this guide isn't the way to do it.  If you just want to beat the game without getting anything, the guide isn't even needed.  Save your money and go to GameFAQs for help.  There people will actually help you master the game and find everything.  Oh, and there the people actually HAVE secrets.ke an FAQ... only with screenshots.  Seriously, if you want to MASTER Legend of Legaia, this guide isn't the way to do it.

He's all about the monsters and things that go bump in the night.  Right?  Nope.  And if you really think horror is what Stephen King is all about then you obviously haven't read \\"Different Seasons\\".<br /><br />\\"Different Seasons\\" is, I think, some of King's best written work ever!  Four tales, and they're not horror!  As King said in the first page of the book \\"It is the tale, not he who tells it.\\"  This is very much true in this book.  Four novellas, each of them accompanied by a \\"season\\" theme.<br /><br />The four Novellas are breathtaking stories (three of them were movies... VERY GOOD MOVIES) that are not about monsters or anything like that, but portraying the human spirit, and the human heart.<br /><br />\\"Hope Springs Eternal: Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption\\" is the perfect example.  Andy Dufrense is a man sentenceed to serve a life sentence in prison for a murder he didn't commit.  You'd think the prison known as Shawshank would get to him, but it doesn't.  It's Andy's hope that allows him to get through Shawshank and survive a sadistic warden.  \\"Rita Haywroth and Shawshank Redemption\\" also made the best movie of the lot (I'm sure most of you have seen it).<br /><br />\\"Fall From Innocence: The Body\\" is another perfect example of the common human emotion.  Fear.  When four boys stumble across a body, they're faced with ultimately the fact that they're not invincible, and that mortality is a reality.  \\"The Body\\" was perhaps the best story in the entire collection.<br /><br />Perhaps the only story I didn't like was \\"A Winter's Tale: The Breathing Method\\".  The only reason I didn't like it was because the other three stories (Including \\"Summer of Corruption: Apt Pupil\\" which I didn't talk about) were all about common human emotions.  But \\"The Breathing Method\\" seemed like a short horror story that King threw in because he can't seem to leave it (he even mentions so in the afterward).<br /><br />Overall, if you want to see a different side of Stephen King, then \\"Different Seasons\\" is the book you want.  Other great reads to see King outside of horror are \\"The Green Mile\\" and \\"Delores Claiborne\\".  Have fun, and happy reading.  These tales are amazing.> <br />Overall, if you want to see a different side of Stephen King, then \\"Different Seasons\\" is the book you want.

US	48278407	R11XA3YOJ2N7T5	0743412273	639916239	Pet Sematary	Books	5	4	5	N	N	Among his greatest works!	Commonly, very commonly, I'll come across an avid Stephen King fan.  And every time I ask this avid fan what their favorite Stephen King the book is, the answer I usually get is \\"The Shining.\\"<br /><br />But if you were to ask me what I thought was Stephen King's best book, I'll respond with \\"Pet Sematary\\".  It was a book that kept me on the edge of my seat, and it had a good story to tell.<br /><br />Louis Creed and his family have just moved out into Ludlow, Maine.  The woods just beyond their home (a part of their property) hold a dark secret.  That secret is known as the \\"Pet Sematary.\\"  But there's more to it.  Beyond the Pet Sematary is an even darker secret.  This dark secret will eventually allow Louis to play God, and nullify the rules of death.  But in the end the secret becomes horrifying and bone chilling.<br /><br />What makes Pet Sematary a good read is probably that it deals with a common fear many people share.  Death.  It's not the thought of dying that's scary, it's the thought of what's after it that is (for most people).  Stephen King puts this fear into a novel and not only are there some chilling lines (\\"Sometimes dead is better.), but a few gruesome images.<br /><br />I do have one complaint (two actually) about the book.  For one, the characters aren't as well developed as they were in \\"The Shining.\\"  The reason I began to fear Jack Torrance was because I KNEW Jack Torrance by the time he went insane.  In Pet Sematary none of that seems to happen.<br /><br />My second complaint is a mild one.  I liked the pace of the story, but the scariest part of the book came extremely late, and when the rollar coaster began to go downhill, the ride was over faster than I wanted it to be.  In all essence, I thought there could've been more to the books final fifty pages.<br /><br />The ENDING is what saves this book from losing one star.  Stephen King, to me at least, has done some weird endings in the past (\\"Christine\\", and a few of his short stories in \\"Everything's Eventual\\"), but this one was just perfect.  Not only was it terrifying, but it left you with a thought so creepy you kept your bedroom light on.<br /><br />Overall, I'd say Pet Sematary is Stephen King's best book (with \\"Misery\\" and \\"The Shining\\" coming in second).  It had terror, suspense, and an underlying fear we try as little of as possible.<br /><br />A breathtaking, bone-chilling read.his short stories in \\"Everything's Eventual\\"), but this one was just perfect.

US	48278407	R1Z72BMT1052WI	0451160444	467915322	Christine (Signet)	Books	4	2	2	N	N	A good read, but as stated: not scary.	I have to agree with the previous review below me in almost every way.  Christine, while a good book, is one that had so much potential to be scary.  But it wasn't.  Nearly everything about the book shines, but come down to the bear bones of horror, Christine is a popped balloon folks.<br /><br />Arnie Cunningham is a nerd.  The kind of kid who everyone at school picks on.  If it weren't for friends like Dennis Guilder, Arnie would get killed in high school.  Luckily, Arnie does have Dennis.<br /><br />One fine summer morning, while taking a ride with Dennis, Arnie spots a 1958 Plymouth in a yard.  Immediately, Arnie takes a shine to the car.  I guess it is nice to fine a busted down car that's uglier than you, isn't it?<br /><br />We learn the cars name is Christine.  As the book goes on we learn that Christine is more than just a car.  She's a demon on wheels (literally), and she's slowly posessing Arnie.<br /><br />I suppose my biggest gripe with the book is that it simply isn't scary.  Even when finishing this book late at night, it isn't scary in anyway.  I've read some good scary books by King (\\"The Shining\\") but \\"Christine\\" sucks the big one as far as being scary goes.<br /><br />But where it lacks in being scary, it makes up for in the overall story.  The idea of a haunted car isn't bad.  The idea of said haunted car being able to possess its owner is even better!<br /><br />Where the book truly shines though, are the characters.  Stephen King, in my mind, has a knack for making good believable characters, and Christine is no exception.  As the book moves on, you begin to care about most of the characters.

US	48278407	R1D3RYQ6QAZIYY	0451169522	916592852	Misery	Books	5	1	1	N	N	A Terrific Read	To be truthful, I wasn't much into Stephen King.  Until a friend recommended Carrie to me, I never much cared for his works.  But after reading Carrie, I began to realize why people like him.<br /><br />And after reading Misery I'm willing to admit I like him too.<br /><br />Misery is more than just your typical novel.  The style in which it's written is actually a little different than what I'm used to (some chapters are only ONE WORD LONG), but let's be honest here.  It isn't how the story is written, it's the story itself.  I can deal with horribly written books (and Misery is NOT horribly written by the way) so long as the story is good for me.  Misery is not a horribly written book, just different.  It'll take a moment to get used to but you'll manage.<br /><br />Misery is a story about a man named Paul Sheldon who was in an accident (cause of alchohol) and nursed back to health by his \\"number one fan\\" Annie Wilkes.  Paul is famous for his \\"Misery\\" books, that Annie has taken a real shine to.  But when Annie is disappointed with his latest book, it's only convienent that she has the author there.  So what does she do?  She keeps him hostage and forces him to write a book just for her.  She has many ways of convincing Paul to stay.  One is with a needle, and the other is with an axe.<br /><br />Perhaps the most perplexing thing about Misery is that the story takes place in only one setting.  That setting is in Annie's home, a barn.  But the book still manages to keep you on the edge of your seat.<br /><br />There's something even more interesting about Misery.  The characters.  Paul Sheldon, the all around do-gooder begins to learn things about himself by being held hostage.  He begins to learn that he really does love to write.  And as he clings on to life in his cunning ways, he'll learn he can do more than in his situation than meets the eye.<br /><br />But the true spirit of Stephen King's \\"Misery\\" is Annie Wilkes.  She is by far one of the most interesting characters King has ever created.  Not just because she's a psycho path, but because King manages to really show us why she is so miserable.  He manages to make us feel sorry for Annie WHILE hating her.<br /><br />The book seems to have a message too.  \\"Misery\\" seems to be that message.  What does the title really mean?  Is it to portray Annie's misery throughout her life?  Paul's Misery with being stuck with Annie?  The book series \\"Misery\\" in the book?  Or does it have to deal with life itself.  The book can be interpreted in many different ways.<br /><br />This was a riveting read.  One of the shorter books I've read, but quite possibly one of the best books I've read.  The central message and characters make this one of the most worthwhile works Stephen King has ever produced.the most interesting characters King has ever created.

US	48278407	R1BY8OKXJAKNN6	0671041789	867268465	The Green Mile	Books	5	2	2	N	Y	One of the greatest novels ever written	The Green Mile is a novel that is hard to put down!  The moment it opens up you'll be hooked and you'll soon find the pages won't stop turning.  Where has the time gone? you'll wonder.  I'll tell you where: immersed in Stephen King's novel, \\"The Green Mile.\\"<br /><br />The Green Mile opens up with Paul Edgecombe telling his own story about how he was a guard at Cold Mountain.  He was in charge of deathrow, what he often called \\"The Green Mile.\\"  In his time he sentenced many people to their death, but no one struck him the way John Coffey did.  Coffey is in for raping and murdering two little girls, and the only words he has to say for it is, \\"I tried to take it back, but it was too late.\\"  But Paul doesn't seem to feel John is of any threat, and soon John comes to show there's much more to him than meets the eye.<br /><br />By far this is the most character driven novel I've read in a long time.  Paul comes off as an enlightning character who has seen a miracle, while John comes off as a miracle himself.  This book is driven by character development and it drives without swerving off the road.<br /><br />The Green Mile also has a shocking, yet thought provoking, revelation about life.  If the characters don't make you enjoy this book, that revelation will.<br /><br />The delivery of the book is just as good. Written in first person, King does more than just introduce us to Paul, he befriends us with Paul as he shares his story.<br /><br />The Green Mile is a fun and exciting read, with a climax so suprising and inspiring.  This is by far one of the best books King has ever written.	2005-01-24
US	48278407	R2FK01LPORQGZ4	0671039725	769595666	Carrie	Books	4	0	0	N	N	A good book but drowned out in some areas	This was the first Stephen King book I read, and while I liked it, it was \\"Misery\\" that made me a fan.<br /><br />Carrie centers on a girl (Carrie White) who is relentlessly picked on in school, a girl who seems to be the butt of every joke.  Her mother is overly religious and always punishing her, and only her telekinetic powers can save her.<br /><br />Carrie is written in two aspects.  There's the bit (mostly called \\"The Shadow Exploded) that talks about events that have already passed, and seems to be analyzing it, while the other is the story itself.<br /><br />For me, this was where the story went down hill.  Since the book begins with us already knowing how it's going to turn out (the main story anyway, not the ending) the only thing we have to worry about is getting there.  Yeah, it's horrific and suspenseful, but truly, I felt like some of the fun was taken out of the book because I was already told by the author just how the Prom was going to turn out.  In short, the only surprising aspect of the book was its remarkable ending and that saved it from three stars.<br /><br />Carrie wasn't really a boring read.  I could care less about the moments where the events Carrie caused were being analyzed.  I wanted to SEE it happening, not \\"hear\\" about it.  The main story itself was a joy to read, but it's interrupted too much by the scientific analysis.<br /><br />And the characters were no fun either.  Carrie, she was interesting and so was Sue, but that's about it.  I think what really took the joy out of the characters was Carrie's overly religious mother.  At first you want to believe she's just a psycho, but King really took her far beyond the boundaries of a \\"believeable\\" character.  She wasn't just a psycho, she was from another world!  Carrie's mother seemed to subtract a little from the story for me because she just came off as too high-strung.  She was too far beyond my imagination to think of as \\"believable\\".<br /><br />Carrie wasn't a bad book, just not what I expected from someone who is generalized as a master of the genre.  Carrie was by no means a scary book.  The joy and experience of it was taken out from the very beginning.  I would say Stephen King's later works are much more exciting than this.t a bad book, just not what I expected from someone who is generalized as a master of the genre.

Perhaps because so many people have seen the movie they feel no need to pick up the book at all.  Well, I haven't seen the Stanley Kubrick movie, so when I read \\"The Shining\\" I had no expectations for it.<br /><br />If you saw the movie before reading the book, chances are (judging by these reviews) you won't like it as much because it isn't as \\"scary\\" as the movie.  Well, you can't really say the book is bad, even if you enjoyed the movie more.<br /><br />The Shining is about a man named Jack Torrance who takes his wife and son up to the Overlook hotel in Colorado to take care of it for the winter.  But his son Danny, has a gift.  This gift is called \\"The Shining\\".  The Shining allows Danny to read peoples minds, and see things that are beyond horror for his mind to comprehend.  The Overlook Hotel has a haunting past, and because of Danny's shining, he can see them.  Soon the hotel will control Jack and send him out of control and drive him mad.  But Danny and Wendy (the wife) are snowbound, and that means that when Jack does go insane, there will be no way out.<br /><br />It's easy to see how this is a classic.  It's often times said to be the scariest book King has ever written.<br /><br />Truthfully though, you've got to have patience when you read this book.  King spends a lot of time developing Jack, Wendy and Danny, and that makes this book a little more slowly paced than other books he's written.  Slow pace is by no means a bad thing, but The Shining for some may pace too slow.<br /><br />The book was enjoyable though, and while I don't believe it's the best thing King has written (my personal favorite is \\"Misery\\"), but it is a remarkable classic.<br /><br />However, if you've seen the Kubrick film, I can't imagine many people enjoying this to the full extent.  The Kubrick film ruins most of the surprises and takes away from the suspense and horror (and the film is VERY different from the book).  The climax of the book, many may argue, is not as shattering as the films.  However, this shouldn't stop the read from being an enjoyable one.from the book).

Why would you doubt Nintendo Power?  This guide is absolutely astonishing.  Of course if you already have the Final Fantasy Origins guide by Bradygames... you'll already have the meat of this guide.  That does not by all means mean you shouldn't buy it.<br /><br />Final Fantasy Dawn of Souls is almost a game where you may find the need to pick a guide up.  Not just because Final Fantasy I is completely non-linear but because the next location in both games isn't always obvious.  A little helping hand is good for some of these instances.<br /><br />The puzzles won't give you much trouble but you'll feel you'll need the help.  Everything in this guide is perfect.  All monsters are detailed and there's a complete walkthrough including the extra dungeons!<br /><br />The guide is almost perfect.  There aren't a whole lot of glaring things about it; some boss strategies in both sections were lacking detail.  Stats, yes.  Actual strategy for the bosses?  That's questionable. My last gripe with this guide is they did the same thing BradyGAMES did with the FFOrigins guide.  They didn't label the floors.  With how long some of the dungeons get (especially in FFII) its easy to lose track of your own position.<br /><br />This guide covers all the extras.  The bonus dungeons are explained in perfect detail.  The Soul of Rebirth in FFII also has a full walkthrough.<br /><br />Now, back to the BradyGAMES issue.  If you already have the BradyGAMES FFOrigins guide... it may not be neccessary to pick this one up really.  Unless you're craving some help with the extras.  The walkthrough for both games reads almost exactly like the BradyGAMES guide.  It's almost as if Nintendo grabbed a copy and used some tips.  After reading through both guides they both detail nearly the exact same information.  EVERYTHING in this guide (except the bonus extras, and some boss' HP levels) can be found in the FFOrigins guide.  So if you already have that guide it may not be worth the money to spend another fifteen dollars for a guide that is virtually the same. For the extras you might want to just head off to GameFAQs.<br /><br />Overall, this is one handy guide to keep by your side when you go about Final Fantasy I and II.<br /><br />The Good<br />+Fully detailed walkthrough for both games<br />+Extras covered<br /><br />The Bad<br />-If you have the BradyGAMES FFOrigins guide it may not be worth it to pick this up for the extras alone.hat is virtually the same.

US	48278407	R248GE89N386O6	0743455967	44310359	On Writing	Books	5	3	3	N	Y	A Brilliant Inspiration for writers everywhere	If you have a dream of becoming a writer then I suggest you pick up this book.  There is much to learn from this book (if you haven't picked up many books on writing already).  But lets be forewarned here.  This is a \\"Memoir\\" of the craft, not just a \\"This is how to write\\" book, which several people seem to overlook.<br /><br />As the book begins he talks about his childhood and his adult life.  \\"What does this have to do with writing?\\" you'll probably ask yourself.  Then you'll remember that along with talking about the craft, he's creating a memoir.  Even in his childhood and early adulthood he was a writer.  The purpose of the first half of the book is for him to explain how he got to where he is today and where some of his inspiration came from.  In the first half he mentions several of his books and where the inspiration for those books came from.<br /><br />But the real meat is after the C.V. in which King talks about the Toolbox and truly begins what the book is about.  On Writing.<br /><br />The entire section on writing has helped me a lot.  He has some pretty useful tips for anyone who dreams of writing.  He talks about how the first important thing should be the story and to take out what isn't the story.<br /><br />It's amazing how brutally honest King can be.  But brutal honesty is always the greatest (and often times most helpful) truth.  From reading this book I've been able to back and see what I've been doing wrong.  Out go those clumsy and redundant adverbs.  Out goes all that \\"telling\\". Out go the needless (and often times only flavoring) words.  Through this book I've learned how to connect with the reader, as well as the text.<br /><br />The book has also answered several questions about grammar, character development and even why you have paragraphs that are as short as one sentence, and sometimes even one word.<br /><br />King even goes as far as to show us an unedited copy from one of his stories (1408) and the changes made to it.  You'll see that even King makes a lot of errors and that he's only human.<br /><br />Will this book make you a better writer? The answer is simply that it can.  It won't \\"make\\" you a better writer unless you WANT to be a better writer.  If you \\"want\\" to be a better writer but you're not willing to take tips outlined in this book or any other book, then you obviously don't care to be a better writer.<br /><br />Now then.  A lot of people think this book is nothing more than an ego trip.  This isn't entirely true, but it isn't too far off.  A lot of people say these tips are useless and couldn't possibly be of any use.<br /><br />To those readers I ask this.  Are YOU a published author?  Are YOU the world's best-selling novelist?  Are people standing in lines and rushing off to read YOUR books and stories? And most importantly, are you a SUCCESSFUL writer, doing what you love? If the answer to these questions is \\"no\\" then you've no right to say these tips aren't helpful.  Maybe you should actually try them before you jump to conclusions.<br /><br />After the writing King talks about his accident in the summer of 1999.  This is perhaps my only problem with the book.  It was great to hear insight on the accident and all, but the book (throughout the memoir and the craft) talks about the van several times!  It's almost redundant how often he mentions he was struck by a van in the summer 1999 when on a walk in Maine.<br /><br />I was also saddened that throughout the entire Memoir and craft he never mentions a thing about \\"The Dark Tower\\" series.  This is often said to be one of his greatest achievements as an author but he never once mentions The Dark Tower books.  He mentions \\"The Stand\\" (often said to be his greatest work).  Not only did he neglect the Dark Tower series, but he also never touches base with writing as Richard Bachman.  In the memoir it would've been nice if he had been able to tell us a few things such as what really inspired the Dark Tower books or even why he wrote under the name Richard Bachman for a few years.<br /><br />Anyway, this is a worthwhile read.  Any die-hard fan of Stephen King owes it to himself/herself to pick up this book and read it.Dark Tower books or even why he wrote under the name Richard Bachman for a few years.   <br /> <br />Anyway, this is a worthwhile read.

But go through it without some help and you're bound to miss something. This guide is almost perfect in everyway possible. But there are some troubling things that keep this guide down a little.<br /><br />First of all, this tome is jampacked with tons of helpful tips. Everything you need in the opening pages to know about the game is there. The guide details on all the basics of CQC. From the basics to the advanced tactics. You'll be a master of CQC. The guide also spends a lot of time detailing everything about the food.<br /><br />The food section tells you if you can use it on enemies or not and how. They also tell you how it taste and whether its worth eating or not. The cure section tells you all you need to cure wounds and how to do it.<br /><br />The walkthrough is very well written. Each section has a detailed set of maps, the location of every guard and the location of every item. It's very well written too, with EXCELLENT boss strategies that help out really well. Each portion of the walkthrough is broken down by area rather than objective. This is great in the sense that it's more organized. The walkthrough is actually done really well with great tactics. This is easily one of the most well written walkthroughs I've ever read.<br /><br />The Easter Eggs and secrets are really cool. They go into detail on some of the better ones and talk about the bonuses and such. The secrets chapter is also done well. Alongside that, the Snake vs. Monkeys is also done really well. Each strategy to take on the monkeys helps you get excellent times and even first place assuming you take them in the recommended orders.<br /><br />Then there's the stuff after the meat of the game. The interviews are spectacular and help you learn more than anything about the production of the game and the MGS series. After that there's an excerpt from the Konami Comic Book of Metal Gear Solid. This is an incredible comic. It may actually make you want to by the series.<br /><br />But the guide isn't without a few faults. For one, the walkthrough is only written for Normal mode. There are areas where there are more guards and such and the guide doesn't talk about that. What's the difference between playing the game on Normal and Extreme? You'd be surprised how many hardcore MGS fans just jump to Hard Mode without ever touching the lower difficulty levels.<br /><br />The guide also mentions that there are \\"secret\\" frequencies to call but they never tell you what the frequency is! They mention that you have to interrogate a guard in order to get it. But they still don't detail what the frequency is or what it does...<br /><br />Then there's the biggy (and the reason five stars was an impossible feet), there are several easter eggs and secrets missing!  They don't mention that you can get the EZ Gun on other difficulty levels nor do they mention anything of the infinity face paint.  Not only that but they never mention how it is you're supposed to come across certain ranks.  All the ranks are listed but how do I get say... the \\"FOX\\" ranking?  The guide doesn't detail it.<br /><br />It really is a good guide, almost perfect. But the small tidbits (and the one rather large rat) are annoying at times. I wish it was a bit more detailed on some of the secrets and gave more insight for the different difficulty levels.<br /><br />Either way though, this is the perfect MGS3 companion. You shouldn't have any trouble getting through the game without it. It'll help you conquer the game and even master it at some point.

What made the Alex Cross Novels good isn't in this one at all.  Patterson has ultimately made the same mistake with this book that he has made with \\"The Big Bad Wolf\\" and \\"Violets Are Blue\\".  The plot is mediocre, the characters unbelievable and an all around boring read that doesn't keep you on the edge of your seat.<br /><br />The book begins when the small town of Sunrise Valley, Nevada is evacuated due to a \\"terrorist\\" threat.  When the entire town is evacuated a bomb goes off and the entire town of Sunrise Valley is blown away.  In the midst of the blast, Colonial Geoffrey Shafer, better known as the Weasel, (featured in POP GOES THE WEASEL) is seen filming the blast.  The brutal Russian killer known as the Wolf admits to being behind the crime and says there will be more bombings if he isn't paid a sum of money totaling over 2 Billion.  There's only one man who can stop the Wolf and the Weasel from causing more \\"terrorist\\" acts. If you guessed Alex Cross, you're right.<br /><br />The plot is perhaps where the book first starts to fall.  A \\"terrorist\\" threat isn't such a bad idea, but if I wanted to hear a story about a terrorist threat I'd turn on CNN.  The book also doesn't go into reasons why it was blown off the map other than to strike fear into America.<br /><br />I'm not too impressed with this particular Alex Cross novel.  Patterson has, as I said, made the same mistakes all over again.  For one, the Wolf continues Patterson's \\"super villian\\" trend.  It's nice to have a ruthless villian, but he should still be a believable villian.  The Wolf is unbelievable.  Patterson used to have a way with making up Villians that we \\"love to hate\\", like Gary Soneji (Along Came a Spider).  Well, I don't \\"love to hate\\" the Wolf, I just plain hate him.<br /><br />The Wolf isn't the only character unblievable character.  Alex Cross has gone from being the logical detective to being James Bond and a one man army.  Alex Cross is a smart character, but Patterson has now made him too perfect to be the same Alex Cross I admired in \\"Along Came a Spider\\" and \\"Kiss the Girls\\".  It's even come down to the point where Alex just knows.  There's no reason why he knows, he just does. The book fails to explain anything.<br /><br />There's more to the character flaws in this novel.  Motive.  Besides money, what is the Wolf's motive?  What reason does he have for blowing Sunrise Valley off the map? Is simply to strike fear?<br /><br />Finally, Patterson seems to go TOO fast near the end.  It's as if he saying to himself \\"I've gone far enough, I have to end it soon.\\" and so the ending turns out to be rushed and lacking detail.<br /><br />There are better novels to get than this.  The first six Alex Cross Novels are books to remember.  Alex Cross is a washed up character now, and Patterson is only bringing him down further by presenting more in the series like this.  Look for a better thriller and all around better book.y.

It details every mission and helps you get all the hidden goodies but there are a few things that stand out.<br /><br />The walkthrough is incredible!  No matter what people say, this guide has INCREDIBLE depth to it.  So big and exhaustive.  Every mission is covered to the fullest but that makes for some of the errors the guide has.<br /><br />GTA: San Andreas is a HUGE game.  How could you possibly expect an error-free guide? Well, you can't.  There are a couple of screenshots that are misplaced and the guide encourages you to use them.  Most screens are pretty clear and are clearly visible.<br /><br />Touching on the items being off by a bit, this is because of how the map is.  It doesn't matter that the item is a few centimeters off, what matters is that the item is in the general area of where the guide advises you to go, and they are.<br /><br />The maps themselves could use a bit of a touch up.  They don't feel as detailed as they could be but luckily there is a fold out map that is much bigger and easier to navigate by.<br /><br />There is one last problem I have with the guide.  Aren't strategy guides expensive enough as it is?  They already cost $15!  This one cost $17 dollars and its only because the PAGES are thicker, NOT the lentgh.  The guide is 272 pages (the same amount of pages as the BradyGAMES FFX guide) and cost more than other guides that are this many pages (with the exception of Star Ocean).  Hopefully BradyGAMES doesn't go down this path for too much longer because over time, the two dollars can add up.<br /><br />Overall, this is a good guide for an outrageous price.  But for some people its worth it.  You will get a lot out of this game with the guide so try not to pass it up.	2004-11-05

This is by far the most comprehensive strategy guide I've seen!  It may be tiny (height and width wise) but it goes to show that big things come in small packages.<br /><br />If you're having any trouble with Phantom Brave, this is the guide to get!  The walkthrough is DETAILED... VERY DETAILED.  If you say this is a bad guide, you must be reading it upside down.<br /><br />Speaking of upside down, there actually is a section that is printed upside down intentionally.  This is the section that has the spoilers and such.  It's printed upside down for good measure too.  How many times have you casually flipped through a strategy guide and seen a \\"certain something\\" happening to a \\"certain somebody\\" (BradyGames FFVII guide anyone?); or even worse: an ending spoiled? This guide prevents that and even at the top of these pages it says in big bold red letters \\"SPOILERS\\".<br /><br />The walkthrough is the most incredible aspect of the guide.  Most guides are decorated with tons of artwork to take up space. Well not this one! This guide has text virtually EVERYWHERE and its really helpful too.  Nice BIG and clear screenshots with helpful captions.  That's not all, the guide has a good sense of humor and doesn't take itself so seriously.  It's always nice when a guide reads more like a companion as opposed to reading like a computer. In all essence: The guide speaks to you. Detailed maps and helpful tactics that'll let you win.<br /><br />As if that wasn't enough, the guide has advanced techniques.  In these advanced techniques you'll find a way to beat the game in less than five hours and STILL have all the best items you can get!  How incredible is that!?<br /><br />There's one small little bonus too.  If you look at the top corner of the right page (odd pages) you can make the guide like a flip book.  Just flip the guide and stare at the top corner and you'll notice Ash is moving.  Okay, a little useless but you can tell the authors put their heart and soul into this guide.<br /><br />Lastly, don't miss an interview in the back with Nippon Ichi.  Not only will reading this interview help you learn about Phantom Brave and its creation but you get insight on Disgaea: Hour of Darkness as well.<br /><br />This is one incredible guide and no one should miss ou ton it.  This is the perfect companion to Phantom Brave.  Much more detailed than any other strategy guide out there.h is moving.

Well, I don't care if I need a guide or not I pick it up anyway.<br /><br />This particular guide is really handy.  This is easily one of the better guides I've seen and I've got hundreds of strategy guides lying around the house (literally).<br /><br />This particular guide is the best and most comprehensive way of going through Castlevania LOI.  A complete full walkthrough and it gives you all the secret goodies for after you've completed the game.<br /><br />Castlevania has simple puzzles but sometimes finding everything requires a different course of action.  This guide helped me find all the relics, all the keys and helped me unearth all the secrets Castlevania has to offer.<br /><br />The walkthrough is detailed, complete with maps.  The maps show you where all the items and switches are, making it easy to navigate.  There is one small tid-bit with how the guide is.  It's done perfectly but you'll find yourself flipping back to the map a lot because of how the game's camera is constantly rotating.<br /><br />Boss strategies are very handy and reveal everything you need to know to beat every boss, including the forgotten one.<br /><br />I was also very impressed with how the guide made suggestions as what sub-weapons I should take for a certain area.  I usually only rely on the cross but using this guide I found there are some instances where the cross just isn't always the best.<br /><br />This is a very impressive guide that should help anyone get through the game of Castlevania: Lament of Innocence with very little trouble.  It also helps you uncover 100% of the castle and actually SHOWS you with screenshots how to do things.  No problems with the guide, its worth buying if you need the help with the game.	2004-10-27

Not much.  If you want to complete the game but get absolutely nothing else... then get the guide.  The walkthrough and layout is really detailed... but aside from the walkthrough getting you through the game (which even that isn't saying too much) there's not much else.<br /><br />To be frank.  The guide has nice maps and screenshots.  They're fairly detailed and good for navigating.  But as others have stated below.  Some things in this guide are just plain useless.<br /><br />Take the Pokedex for example.  If you want a detailed pokedex Prima expects you to spend 25 ADDITONAL dollars to buy a better one.  Lets add that up shall we?  Pokemon Game 35 dollars;  Prima's Official Strategy Guide: 15 dollars; Prima's Collector's Edition Pokedex, 25 dollars.  If you go with Prima you'll spend over 70 dollars to get it all!  Do you really want that?<br /><br />That's not the only problem.  There is no moves lists and they don't give you an explanation on things like berries, nature, breeding or even on trading!  What kind of Pokemon Guide doesn't give you info on Trading!? Isn't the point of Pokemon to Catch 'em All? You won't do that with this guide.<br /><br />Obviously, Prima assumes that everyone who picks this game up is already a Pokemon Veteran.  A guide should never assume such.  Not everyone played the original version.  The fact that this guide was on the shelf two weeks before the game was even released tells you that Prima didn't exploit the game for all it was worth.  There's a lot of info missing from this guide.<br /><br />My advice, grab the Nintendo Power guide.  Its 100 pages larger and doesn't have quite so many errors.  If you DO grab this guide then know that you won't master the game.  If you just want to get through the game without really mastering it or finding anything out (or you don't have questions) then go ahead and grab it.  But if you WANT everything this game has to offer save your money and buy the Nintendo Power guide.<br /><br />*Review will be revised later*r /> <br />*Review will be revised later*	2004-09-21

This is the most comprehensive guide to any Pokemon game ever.  In-depth walkthrough to help you get through the game with user friendly maps and trainer tips.<br /><br />The guide also doesn't waste time saying stupid things to fill you in on events that just happened.  The walkthrough gets to the point and stays on track, keeping you informed of new pokemon in an area and keeping you up to date with what Trainer's will use.<br /><br />The Pokedex is amazing and as with most every Nintendo Power guide, has almost no errors whatsoever. Definitive stats to help you decide if you want a Pokemon who can take a lot of damage or dish it all out.  The Pokedex is also HUGE. NOT just covering the Pokemon found in FireRed/LeafGreen but they also cover pokemon from Ruby and Sapphire as well.<br /><br />No matter what ANYONE says, you absolutely can't go wrong with Nintendo Power!  Nintendo Power makes THE best guides for any game you could possibly buy.  If you truly want to master this Pokemon Adventure you MUST grab this guide.  Much better than the Prima Guide.	2004-09-21

But as it says in the heading, the information is all over the place and that means there's A LOT of page flipping.<br /><br />Don't be fooled by the exhaustive size.  The guide just has thick pages.  The book is heavy but each page is full of tons of info, to the point where its helpful enough so that you can get through the game without fail.<br /><br />The guide will quickly help you adjust to the game in an easy way.  The font size is small so there's a lot on one page but this shouldn't be a problem. The screens are crystal-clear.<br /><br />The characters section is really helpful giving a little bio and then a list of what level the character will learn Battle Skills, Support Skills and spells.  Then there's a handy table of the battle skills they posses, showing the weak position and strong position.<br /><br />The walkthrough is different.  It is divided into chapters and at the beginning of each chapter is an outline of everything you'll do.  In the outline they tell you when all the private actions come up and where, all the main events, bosses (but no strategies in the outline), battle trophies and any time you can sign an inventor. The outline also directs you to the proper page.  This is very handy if you want to get the most out of the game without the guide taking away the fun.<br /><br />The walkthrough also lists all the enemies in an area and has some detailed maps with a handy dandy items lists.  Boss strategies are detailed but they take a little while to get to the actual strategy.<br /><br />The guide details all the bonus dungeons, mini-games and sidequests.  In the process they also have an entire section dedicated to the Private Actions.  In the Private actions section they show you the consequences of each one.  Who you'll gain points with and who you'll lose points with.  You'll also know exactly when its availible, the requirements, where it is and of course, the guide tells you what page to turn to to find it.<br /><br />Along with the items and equipment lists you've got an item creations sectoin.  In the Item Creators section they'll tell you what character specializes in what, where they are and the signing requirements.<br /><br />The Bestiary is huge but it works.  Rather than most guides you have to search through each of the enemies alphabetically, in the walkthrough not only are the enemies basic stats listed, but each enemy has a number.  On the side of each page in the bestiary it tells you what numbers your looking at.  It's much easier to find the enemies number than to find their name.  It works too.<br /><br />This is an incredible tome but there are a few little tidbits that annoy me. For one, this guide is heavier than most of guides of this length.  The second is simply the walkthrough moves a little too slowly.  Sure they tell you all you need but sometimes they waste too much time trying to catch you up on what you're supposed to be doing.  At least they don't spoil the storyline but sometimes I wish BradyGAMES would get to the point.  My last small tidbit is to fully utilize this guide you've got to flip around a lot.  Especially if you plan on doing all the Private Actions.  Its clear the guide wants you to use the Private Actions list in the back.<br /><br />Overall, the guide deserves five-stars.  The walkthrough is a little sluggish at times and you've got to flip pages a lot (you may want to bookmark some) but the guide is a great resource in helping to do all the game has to offer.<br /><br />OVERALL<br /><br />The Good<br /><br />+Nice game basics<br /><br />+Good walkthrough<br /><br />+Outline of events makes the walkthrough easier and faster to use<br /><br />+Bonus Dungeons and Private Actions covered<br /><br />+Item Creation<br /><br />+Easy to use Bestiary<br /><br />The Bad<br /><br />-For 272 pages this guide is thick and is kind of heavy<br /><br />-A LOT OFPAGE FLIPPING!<br /><br />-GET TO THE POINT BRADYGAMES!

This is by far one of the best Metroid Prime guides out there... if you can find it.  VERSUS BOOKS was about quality guides and this one is no different.<br /><br />The guide starts off with basic training.  This is great to look at if you need basic tips that the manual doesn't cover quite as well. They talk about a few little tips here and there and it'll certainly help you get started.<br /><br />The maps are incredibly detailed (and the map appendix really helps too) but this brings me to one of my first gripes.  The little symbols on the map are all in the table of contents and there are quite a bit.  The good news is that you won't have to keep flipping back since as you go along it becomes second nature.<br /><br />The walkthrough is where my main problem is though.  I like how this guide is orgnaized. Everything is a nice section but well... it seems that in manufacturing the guide the screens got out of context and out of order.  Some screens come mountains of words later.  Not only that but because o the three columns a lot of the screens easily stack up on one another.  The walkthrough CAN be used but trying ot use the screens can be rather confusing.<br /><br />At least they give off awesome strategies to more than make up for it and you shouldn't get lost using these maps along with the labled sections for each of their chapters.<br /><br />What's better? The game covers all the connectivity secrets and bonuses!  You'll be able to unlock the fusion suit and everything.  The guide even has a walkthrough for the original NES Metroid!  Its the only guide besides Nintendo Power that actually has one.<br /><br />Overall, this is quite a satisfying guide.  You should be able to get through the game with little problems using this guide.	2004-07-24

But attempt to uncover EVERY secret and master EVERYTHING the game has to offer and you could probably use a leg up.  While a guide for MGS isn't needed, those wanting to master the game will probably need it.<br />The guide is vividly detailed in the aspect of its artwork and maps (both of which are official) and incredible interviews.  The guide certainly has lots and lots of eye-candy for you to look at.  The character bios are in-depth and provide LOTS of info on the characters.<br />The guide also does what virtually all the other ones don't. Actually detail the differences between the difficulty levels!  Want to know what changes when you play EXTREME? This guide will actually tell you! Unlike all the others I saw.  The guide even provides tips and hints for the higher difficulty levels.<br />The guide also gives off strategies for the VR Missions and they're useful.  They'll help you get some good times, although some of the unauthorized guides will give you better.  But you'll definitely pass through ALL of the VR missions with ease, speed and using the least of your resources.<br />The walkthrough is grand.  Complete with official maps that point out where you start and where you should go.  The strategies and tips are unbelievable and the guide is full of screenshot after screenshot after screenshot. All of which are incredibly detailed.  The screenshots are crystal clear and there are a huge abundance of them!<br />The maps have points in them (A,B,C and all that stuff) as well as an items list.  Incredible detail that guides you through everything you need.<br />The walkthrough however, is where the problem is.  This is a Mission Handbook and therefore the walkthrough talks to you as if briefing you on an area.  This isn't so bad but it makes it so the guide takes a while to get across information that could be vital to your survivial.<br />The second part wrong with the walkthrough is that some info is all over the place.  Looking at point A on the map will mean reading an entire page to get the gist of just what the author is trying to tell you.  Also, they have &quot;Tech Notes&quot; which is more or less repeated information from what you read in the main sections of the walkthrough.<br />The guide also has a crapload of spoilers!  Yeah, spoilers.  I don't mind spoilers very much but the next gamer might.  The endings and every movie cinema can be spoiled if you look to the bottom of a page.<br />The good news is the game has been out for a while now so everyone probably knows the story.  The bad news is that a guide is still a guide and therefore I must be fair.<br />So yes, grab this guide ESPECIALLY if you're into collecting them.  The guide is by far one of the best looking and most presentable of any strategy guide I've ever seen before.  A great guide for a great game.that some info is all over the place.

Unfortunately BradyGAMES doesn't quite give you the boost you need all the time and while you can find everything, you'll have a heck of a time trying to find it using this walkthrough.<br />The guide begins with character bios and a short introduction.  Then it goes into the &quot;Knight School&quot; section which will teach you everything you need to know about the game including the differences in difficulty levels.  It gives you all the combos for all the weapons and prices for new combos and such which is good.<br />But beyond that the walkthrough is the problem.  It'll get you through the game but the way its composed and presented doesn't always work.  They begin with a 3D level map pin-pointing out items, telling you how many enemies, secret chests and innocents are in a level.  But then the walkthrough begins with its text and thats when you notice a few things.  For one, this walkthrough paces very slowly, focusing on some things that have no meaning in the walkthrough.<br />Second, there are a lack of screenshots in this guide.  Some things it tries to explain but then there's no screenshot to illustrate what the author is trying to say.  At least the walkthrough is well written in the aspect that the author is talking to you and not babying you.<br />The guide WILL help you master the game 100% but you have to be willing to work at a level slowly.  The guide points out optional chests and tells you what's inside.  When it comes to innocents, however, the guide is helpful but slow.  If you are going to use this guide its one of those games where if you need some help you have to pause it... if you don't an innocent might be killed.<br />If you need the leg up this is a great guide to buy.  It'll even tell you what the point to mastering all those levels are and the guide has no spoilers so it isn't bad.  But the lack of screenshots and slow moving detail in the walkthrough make it so that you spend more time reading the walkthrough than playing the actual game.ough make it so that you spend more time reading the walkthrough than playing the actual game.	2004-06-02

The guide is full of lots of screenshots but they don't really depict anything, just what's going on in the story.  The walkthrough doesn't help much. It's more of walkthrough designed for the one who wants to go through the game quickly without getting the secrets and such (which the guide doesn't exactly touch base with either).  The walkthrough isn't too confusing but the information provided is just for those who only care about completeing the game.  If you're one who actually needs help with the game then the guide can be a life-saver.  But if you're looking to find all the secrets and such then look to GameFAQs or somewhere else on the net.	2004-04-02

The Soul Calibur 2 Official Fighters Guide is a great &quot;hintbook&quot; but that doesn't neccessarily mean it's a &quot;Strategy Guide&quot;. Which isn't bad.  The guide is after all, a &quot;Fighter's&quot; guide and therefore it helps you to master the combat of Soul Calibur 2 but not the game itself.<br />To begin, the game REALLY helps out for someone who isn't familiar with fighters or the Soul Calibur franchise for that matter.  It helps you learn all the basics quite well.<br />Each character has a combo's list and tips on how to use them. Detailing their strentghs and weaknesses and even tells you for some of them which characters are good to match against others.  It doesn't mention characters to use all the time, but you get the general idea of who should match who.<br />I also like that when reading this guide, its as if it's speaking to you. Therefore, it really is a good reference. Should you be a master at SCII then it probably won't matter, but let's just assume you actually got the guide to help you improve your game.  A master player of Soul Calibur shouldn't need to buy this guide unless you're a collector.<br />I do have a couple of gripes. The guide doesn't go in-depth on the many modes the game has. The Weapon Master Mode does a great job detailing what it is... but how do I go about it?<br />Also, the fact that the combo guide and such is taken straight from the in-game is sad. It DOES tell you combos that aren't in the game itself at least.  There's a moves list for all the characters as well.<br />My last gripe is actually a big one. I LOVE that they have every character but for three specific characters (Assassin, Berserker and Lizardman) they give you a command list but they don't give you the strentghs and weaknesses of these characters. It's as if when they got down to those three they got lazy.<br />A list of all the weapons for every charater is included as well as an art gallery.<br />In short, where the guide fails to please is mostly at the fact that it's mostly a &quot;Character&quot; guide. It's great to learn about the games basics but if you want to master the game itself the guide will only get you halfway there.<br />On the positive side<br />+Covers every character<br />+Strentghs and Weaknesses detailed<br />+A great leg up for those wanting to improve their game in combat.<br />+The text speaks to you<br />+The Game Basics are great for those new to fighting games and Soul Calibur<br />The Bad<br />-It is, sadly, only a &quot;Fighters&quot; guide and not a full blown &quot;Strategy Guide&quot;<br />-Assassin, Berserker and Lizardman aren't detailed enough<br />-Not going to help you master the gamease is mostly at the fact that it's mostly a &quot;Character&quot; guide.

Right off the bat I can tell you this is one of the best looking strategy guides I've ever seen. From the same staff that worked on the Resident Evil 2 Perfect Guide comes a more in-depth guide.<br />The book isn't very thick but it's helpful.  Detailed maps that were drawn by hand to help you navigate through the zombie infested Racoon city.  These maps point ou the location of all items (Even the ones that switch on you).<br />Just before the walkthough the &quot;basic training&quot; section.  This section details all items which are giving a rating based on a five star scale and it details all enemies and how much ammo from each indivual weapon it'll take to kill the enemy.<br />The walkthrough is the most organized of any RE guide to date.  Each section is highlighted superbly.  The basic walkthrough is laid out in step by step form.  If it's part of what you need to do and where to go (the basic instructions of what to do) then it's on a yellow background. If it's a puzzle it's on a red background, if it's a branching point in the game it's on a black background and if its a Nemesis encounter its on a blue background.<br />Branching points in the game (quick decision) are detailed PERFECTLY in this guide. They show a bubble that'll take you to the page you need to be on concerning your decision.<br />The Mercenary Mini-Game is written in the exact same layout as the Hunk and Tofu guide in their RE2 Perfect Guide.  It's step by step and it tells you what to expect in each room.  The guide also has a map for this mini game and shows just what route every character is to be taking.  It'll get you through conserving you the most of your ammo and it even talks about the infinite money trick.<br />Lastly are the secrets.  The secrets section tells you everything you need to know.

After the heart-tugging read that was &quot;The Notebook&quot; I didn't think Nicholas Sparks would make a better book... but I was wrong. &quot;A Walk to Remember&quot; is a simple love story that in the beginning will make you laugh and in the end make you cry. Of all of the books Sparks' has written, this is easily his best one.<br />In Beaufort, North Carolina, 1959, Landon is in his senior year in high-school.  Landon hangs out with the popular crowd, getting into mischief with his friends.  Jamie Sullivan is in the same grade but the complete opposite. She has no friends of her own but the townspeople in the small town of Beaufort adore her!  When both their paths cross Landon and Jamie begin to discover things about each other...and themselves. Landon isn't such a bad kid and Jamie isn't exactly &quot;Ms. Perfect.&quot;  Soon the two become intwined in a loving relationship.<br />The story of &quot;A Walk to Remember&quot; may seem simple at first but the more attatched Landon and Jamie become to each other, the more attatched you become to the characters. You grow to be interested in Landon and Jamie and just what gives them chemistry since they're the complete opposite of each other. Landon is a trouble maker, Jamie the ministers daughter and all around &quot;Do-gooder&quot;.<br />While romance is different each time the book is an enjoyable read that you just can't put down.  The characters shine and Sparks' does an excellent job in the build up of his characters.<br />Where the tear-jerker comes in is where it enters in most love stories, the end. In the end the book will leave you in tears. Not only that but because the love story was crafted so brilliantly, you'll want to read it again and again!<br />&quot;A Walk to Remember&quot; is easily one of the greatest books Sparks' has ever written. A beautiful love story that comes to a tragic end. But it shows that love does exist and that it can strike anyone at any time and of any chemistry.  A great read, don't miss out.that love does exist and that it can strike anyone at any time and of any chemistry.  A great read, don't miss out.	2004-02-29

Kyle has a disability with his speaking (can't pronounce words properly and doesn't speak much).  When Denise is on her way home she's involved in an accident in the middle of a rain storm. When she comes to, meeting a stranger when she awakens, Kyle turns up missing. This stranger, later to be Taylor McAden, sets off and rescues Kyle early on. This quickly forms a strong bond between Denise and Taylor as Taylor soon stops by for visits to see her and Kyle as well.<br />The book starts off high but unfortunately it doesn't soar for long.  Once the beginning of this book is done with, it takes a long time for the love story and characters to develope.  The book is about 400 pages, but the story paces extremely slow at times.<br />The characters, yes, they're likeable. Sparks' always knows how to create interesting and intriguing characters.  Not to mention the book is beautifully written with some of the most descriptive language there is to portray love.  But as I said, things take too much time to develope. By about page 174 the love story finally becomes interesting but after a while it becomes hard to stick with it.  You won't find yourself putting the book down anytime soon but you'll mostly read it just to see if it begins to pick up anytime soon.<br />The book lacks what some of the past novels Sparks' has written had. A tear-jerking, heartwarming love story. The Rescue misses this element that some of his past books had (&quot;A Walk to Remember&quot; and &quot;The Notebook&quot; come to mind).<br />For Nicholas Sparks fans, this book is enticing and you'll love it. It isn't his best work but it isn't neccesarily bad.	2004-02-29
US	48278407	R30YUW277OSPZ2	0316602906	981192109	The Big Bad Wolf	Books	4	2	3	N	N	If your a Big Bad Die Hard fan of Alex Cross its for you.	Don't get me wrong, if you're a huge Alex Cross fan you'll be on the edge of your seat until the very end of this book (which is disappointing to say the least). If you're new to Patterson or the Alex Cross series I'm sure you'll find a more entertaining ride elsewhere.<br />Alex Cross battles the most fearsome killer he's ever met (what, again?)...yes again.  It seems that every new Alex Cross he fights a more fearsome villian.  When reading this book its easy to see where it first starts to go downhill.  The plot is engrossing but the characters are completely unbelievable! At first glance, the Wolf seems like a believable character, as well as those he works with.  But as the book carries on the Wolf, mainly, becomes more and more unbelievable as a character. He has no developement...like say...Gary Soneji (Along Came a Spider, Cat&amp;Mouse).  The Wolf continues Patterson's trend of &quot;Super-Villians&quot;, if you will.<br />The plot and story of the book isn't too bad.  The Wolf hires hitmen to go out and kidnap innocent people off the street...who have been purchased at an online site called &quot;The Wolf Den.&quot;  The story is full of plot-twist as well.<br />Alex Cross fans will find this to be a bit different from the past novels. For one, Cross is no longer with the Washington P.D. but now with the FBI.  However, this continues Patterson's slide into how his character can be unbelievable at times.  Cross is indeed a smart man but that doesn't mean he has to be perfect, as Patterson has now created him to be.  However, Cross is still a great protagonists, but if you been with Alex Cross since &quot;Along Came a Spider&quot; you'll definitely notice change.<br />Not to mention if you're new to the Alex Cross series, this book actually won't make much sense.  Patterson makes references to other books in the series. Nothing big but you'll find yourself scratching your head if you haven't read 'em.<br />Lastly is the ending. If you don't like cliffhanger endings, don't read this book, you'll be left with unanswered questions at the end (and because of Patterson's &quot;formula&quot; you'll have to wait several books later for the conclusion).<br />Overall, I'll give the book 4 stars.  The MAJOR problem with this book are the characters. Totally unrealistic, unbelievable characters. So if you're looking for a thriller to scare you, this isn't it.  &quot;The Big Bad Wolf&quot; isn't such a bad book afterall.hanger endings, don't read this book, you'll be left with unanswered questions at the end (and because of Patterson's &quot;formula&quot; you'll have to wait several books later for the conclusion).  <br />Overall, I'll give the book 4 stars.

US	48278407	R2J2NDU3LXDP73	0316603287	734205902	The Lake House	Books	2	6	6	N	N	Not quite that bad but it is pretty weak.	As others have mentioned, Patterson is more known for his Alex Cross novels and Woman's Murder Club.  &quot;When the Wind Blows&quot; wasn't exactly a bad book. It was actually entertaining to say the least, and believe it or not, its one of Patterson's most successful novels around the world and THAT'S why he made a sequel.<br />I guess the first thing I'd have to ask is that if you HATED &quot;When the Wind Blows&quot; I'd like to know why you wasted a few hours of your life reading this? No, I'm one of the few who liked &quot;When the Wind Blows&quot;.  But you if you abhored it I gaurantee you won't like this one so don't even pick it up and I'll explain why.<br />Of course, the first problem with this book. As a sequel it has potential to be better than the first book, but its not.  This book is too similar to &quot;When the Wind Blows.&quot; The plot in this is the kids with wings now live with foster parents but want to live with Frannie O' Neil, their guardian in &quot;When the Wind Blows.&quot;  Well, a trial ensues and later the kids find a way to escape the foster parents and get back to the lake house to see their original guardian, while escaping an &quot;evil&quot; scientists. It should sound a little familiar.<br />The problem with it being like &quot;When the Wind Blows&quot; is of course the fact that its so similar to the previous novel that this one is very predictable.  This makes the read extremely boring.  Mix that together with some unlikeable characters and you've got one of the less exciting reads in a while.<br />So the Lake House had the potential to be better than &quot;When the Wind Blows&quot;... though I still didn't think that people who disliked the previous book would actually read this one.  Should there be a third in this series it's best just to avoid it all together.<br />If you're really into what James Patterson writes, check out &quot;Along Came a Spider&quot; or any other Alex Cross novel.  Also check out &quot;1st to Die&quot; and the Woman's Murder Club books. They're pretty good.Die&quot; and the Woman's Murder Club books. They're pretty good.	2004-01-28

As far as strategy guides go, I'm more concerned with how its going to get me through the game, and also if it can get me through the game with ease. That's the MAIN point of a guide is to get you through the game.  The Xenosaga Official Strategy Guide does this with ease.  There are a couple of gripes present but otherwise very  nice.<br />The first thing I noticed about the guide were the first about 60 pages of the guide are dedicated to a few of the miscellaneous things.  The game basics and such.  This may not seem like much but the guide explains the basics of the game a lot more clearly than the instruction booklet does.<br />Character profiles are great. They tell you when characters learn techs in an easy to use chart and they also give a small bio for them without spoiling what their main role is in the quest!<br />An weapon/armor/item list is availible.  Easy to use table that tells you what you should buy and what you probably shouldn't.  We all know that in Xenosaga you could spend quite a bit of money and you don't get much.  This guide will help you save your money.<br />A.G.W.S data for them all.  This also suggest what you should and shouldn't buy for them, as well as who should pilot them and what attacks you should focus on using.<br />The walkthrough was perhaps the most helpful part of this guide.  This is where a couple of my small gripes come in but believe me they're very small.  The walkthrough is easy to use and here's a nice thing to do in using this guide, while a movie scene from the game is playing take the time to read the guide.  You'll notice that a lot of the info is extremely helpful.<br />Most noticeable are the boss strategies.  These are VERY helpful strategies but this is where my first gripe with the guide comes in.  The boss strategies are extremely helpful on offense. It's great to know what you can do to the boss but it would also be nice if they told me what the boss could do to me in return.  Other than that these strategies are unbeatable.<br />Before you begin each section you'll see a list of enemies, maps with a very handy key, and a step-by-step objective and items list. VERY helpful walkthrough.<br />My second gripe is minor depending on how you use the guide.  The screenshots aren't always clear. Some are rather fuzzy (the smaller ones).  It's also nice that with each new area you come to there are mini-bios for the characters who you'll meet there.  So the guide is very imformative.  The best part? The guide has NO spoilers to the amazing story that unfolds!<br />Now for those mini-games, side-quests and secrets.  The guide will help you to understand the mini-games and play them to success.  If you're like me you don't play mini-games much.  The guide also covers just about every secret and sidequests there is, again it doesn't spoil the plot.<br />Clearly this is an extremely helpful guide.  You'll love the guide. It's great to use for the game.  Just remember that you won't know what to expect from EVERY boss (there's one that can kill you in one hit and the guide WON'T point it out).se strategies are unbeatable.  <br />Before you begin each section you'll see a list of enemies, maps with a very handy key, and a step-by-step objective and items list.

Nice user-friendly walkthroughs and text make this one of the better guides Bradygames has ever created!<br />What probably stand out most is how thick this book is!  It's HUGE and since its over 350 pages I expected quite a bit from it.  It delivers quite nicely and helps you master the game to 100%<br />The characters section of the guide goes into each character introducing you to the ones used in your party and what role they play in the game. No problems here.<br />The Dresspheres chapter is beautifully done telling you what abilities you get, how to get them and they even suggest when you should get them.  All the Garment Spheres explained and a detailed screenshot and listing of what abilities and power ups you can gain for it.<br />The battle system is explained VERY nicely.  While the battle system doesn't require that a whole section of the guide is dedicated to it, for those new to the world of Final Fantasy it helps, especially considering the battle system differs from Final Fantasy X.<br />The walkthrough is perhaps where the guide begins to fall and it's understandable to see why.  Since Final Fantasy X-2 has no set path (its VERY non-linear) it makes the walkthrough nearly impossible to organize.  All sidequests are incorporated into the walkthrough as well as several secrets.  The walkthrough touches on one area and then doesn't return to it for a while.  So if you're one who uses a guide as you go, it's difficult to do with this guide.<br />The information in the walkthrough is all over the place.  Plus, the table of contents doesn't help you find what part you're at so get ready for a lot of page flipping. However, for what it's worth, the guide doesn't spoil any of the plot and it helps you obtain all the endings as well as 100% completion of the game thanks to the handy-dandy flow chart in the back, ensuring that you do everything you possibly can in one area. Not to mention the maps are highly detail. Each area shows enemies stats perfectly without having you flip to the back of the book (and page flipping in this particular guide is a real pain!).<br />Final Fantasy X-2 is full of mini games and this guide has an entire section for them.  Every mini-game is explained in great detail with tips that will help you through.  Again, it's nice because you'll get everything.<br />The bestiary is detailed explaining all stats but that information is also all over the place.  Each fiend has their own box where their stats are detailed.  A nice easy to use bestiary but again, a lot of pages to flip through.<br />Lastly the guide comes with a two sided poster.  One side with a mixing chart the other just a poster.  The mixing chart is actually in the guide so I wouldn't worry if you lose it or anything.<br />Overall, the guide is pretty good.<br />The good:<br />+Detailed Walkthrough<br />+Nice for those new to Final Fantasy<br />+Clear Screens<br />+Mini-Game Coverage<br />+Detailed Bestiary<br />+A Flowchart for 100% completion.<br />+Helpful Boss Strategies<br />The Bad:<br />-This information is all over the place!<br />-A LOT OF PAGE FLIPPING!ossibly can in one area.

It is a pretty easy game to understand so these basic tips aren't really needed, especially for Mario veterans such as myself.<br />The walkthrough is nice but this is actually where the guide falls short.  If you want a good walkthrough I actually suggest the far superior Nintendo Power guide.  This guide doesn't have any maps of the 80+ levels and so it won't help you find everything in a level.  Some info is missing from the walkthrough but it'll still get you through the game.<br />Aside from that there is the Classic Mario Bros. strategy which you actually shouldn't need, since I'm sure that many of us have been playing that since the first Mario Advance game.<br />Overall the guide is pretty good if you need a leg up or some help, but if you're looking to master the game, the Nintendo Power guide would actually be a lot better to get.	2003-11-27

It's got a walkthrough, maps and secrets but it seems as if something is missing when I look at it.<br />For what it's worth, the guide is actually worthy of 4.5 stars.  The walkthrough is great and simple. You'll get through the game without much of any trouble at all.  All puzzle solutions and tactics for defeating enemies if need be.  No problems here really.  My gripe is that these maps aren't detailed enough.  They're actually the maps presented in the game. So they'll help you navigate but that means they miss a few key things such as item boxes.<br />The guide has an entire secrets section. Be forewarned that this section does have spoilers (and the guide will tell you it does).  I can't express enough how helpful the secrets section was.  I found all the beanstones, completed the mini games with the best scores and times ever!  I was able to find all the strongest armors in the game!  All the badges...everything I need!<br />Screenshots are crystal-clear and are pretty much everywhere.  So while maps need work, the screens should help you in the right direction.<br />There is no reason why this guide isn't helpful.  It's nearly perfect in everyway.  Clear, easy to follow walkthrough. If you need help with Mario and Luigi Superstar Saga, you won't be wrong in choosing this guide.	2003-11-27

I'd give it a five but there are about two things that bother me about the guide (see below).<br />First of all, the guide has a very detailed and easy to use walkthrough.  I loved it. Easy to follow and easy to read with great detailed maps and plenty of screenshots (which you'll undoubtably need!).  There is a maps section before the walkthrough and then they show the maps again before each section of the walkthrough, which makes for far less page flipping.<br />The Metroid Prime section gives you the run down on everything you need for all of Samus' abilities and how to obtain them in this highly detailed walkthrough.  The screenshots are clear although at times they can be a bit darker than others. Some screens are actually very hard to depict what they're trying to tell you even with the text standing out. I wouldn't consider the terrain you venture through in Metroid Prime to be quite that dark.<br />The Metroid Fusion section of this guide is very useful if you want to complete the entire game.  Much like Super Metroid, Metroid Fusion maps seemed more like a grid and Prima did a very good job in these maps by highlighting hidden areas along the way.  Using this guide it is nearly impossible to get yourself lost (although the game makes sure you don't get lost either...).  Again, a run down on all Samus' abilities and a full walkthrough to help you get everything you need to defeat SA-X and save the universe!  A great companion in deed.  The screens are still a little darker in this section but because of the fact that Metroid Fusion has a bit more lighting in some areas than Metroid Prime, you can much more easily depict these.<br />My gripes with the guide. Well first of all, for Metroid Fusion it doesn't depict how to get all the different endings of the game. I do not believe they did this in Metroid Prime either.  Also, there is no walkthrough for the original Metroid. This isn't too bad of a problem but the first Metroid game presents probably one of the greatest challenges in the series (aside from Prime of course) and I need more than just basic &quot;tips&quot; that I've already come to learn by playing other Metroid titles.  My thrid gripe of course is the dark screens but they are crystal clear and you shouldn't have a problem trying to make out anything in the Metroid Fusion section.<br />Overall, this guide is probably your best friend in completing both of these titles. It's nice to see that there was a guide publisher that took Metroid Fusion into consideration.  Both guides are good and WILL help you find everything with little hassle.<br />So...<br />The Good<br />+Complete walkthrough for Metroid Prime and Fusion<br />+Detailed Maps for both section<br />+Nice thorough walkthrough for both sections<br />+Crystal clear screenshots<br />The Bad<br />-Game endings aren't revealed<br />-Metroid Prime screens are a little dark at times<br />-No NES Metroid walkthrough, just &quot;Tips&quot; on how to go through the game.<br />While the last con isn't a problem it would've still been nice to include a short walkthrough at the least being that it is a secret of the game.t too bad of a problem but the first Metroid game presents probably one of the greatest challenges in the series (aside from Prime of course) and I need more than just basic &quot;tips&quot; that I've already come to learn by playing other Metroid titles.

Alright, back when VERSUS BOOKS really truly did make the best guides on the market (in this present day I think they lost it somewhere) you couldn't go wrong. They'd just proved to use that you could go beyond the game with crystal-clear, high-rez screenshots. Not to mention that this guide came after three of their best-sellers (FF7, RE2 and MGS) and they were going to show us once again why VERSUS BOOKS makes the best games on the market.<br />And they did a damn good job with this one!  The most organized and complete guide for Zelda you could ever buy is right here! The &quot;Featuring&quot; section tells you what page holds what secret so that we don't have to fish them out of the walkthrough like some other guides make you.  In-depth boss strategies that will make you feel invincible at times.<br />The best part about this guide were it's insanely detailed maps! Every other guide had some pretty bad maps. Well, they weren't bad but I didn't like that they had no detail. These maps are drawn by hand and to scale.  Making these maps easy to use and I think that this is how every Zelda guide should look!<br />You can be content that you'll be able to open this guide up to any section and be able to see every map, item, and secret that the game has to offer.  You'll be able to conquer the game pretty easily using this guide. Not only that but this guide tells you where to find every item and gold skulltula and all the hidden bosses. New enemies are introduced as the walkthrough progresses as well.<br />I have TWO gripes with this guide. One is that there are no game basics or battle tips. In fact, the guide jumps right into the walkthrough.  Second, while new enemies are called out in the walkthrough it would've been nice to have a separate enemies list.<br />Still, of all the Zelda guides I've ever seen, this one is the best that you can buy. You won't be disappointed with this guide at all. This goes to show that the best Video Game guides on the market (back then at least) are from VERSUS BOOKS!k then at least) are from VERSUS BOOKS!	2003-08-17

It get's you through the game in the most user-friendly way. They have maps (taken from the game though) and they have a nice detailed walkthrough that guides you through the game from start to finish.<br />The maps aren't that detailed but they help in getting you through the game. My gripe with these maps is that they aren't like other RPG guides where you could enter a door and know where you'd end up. Aside from that using the maps along with the quests guide and main quests guide they've provided is nice.  You'll be sure to complete every area fully using these maps with this walkthrough.<br />I like how they also give you the &quot;romance&quot; and other main quests themes along the way. They tell you exactly how to do them with little trouble and quickly as well.<br />I like the characters section and such of this guide. Very good with their layout and telling you everything about each character with a nice bio and then they gave you all the info on weapons, armor etc. Also, they detail about most every enemy in the game (but sadly not all of them are listed here).<br />The appendices are nice and detailed giving you everything you need to know about items and weapons.  Little errors are found throughout the guide as most of the information is accurate.<br />Now, I don't have much of a problem with this and all, but since A LOT of people do I'll mention this.  The guide contains TONS of spoilers to this amazing storyline. Really though, it's hard not to spoil a few things in the game. But as I've said countless times, you get the guide to do just that, guide you. It's a reference book that you're expected to look to for help when you need it, not to have it hold your hand as so many expect of a guide. So, yeah, there are plot spoilers to this game.<br />Overall I'd say 4.5 stars. It's a great guide but I wish the maps could've been better detailed. Plus, the guide doesn't cover all the secrets like you'd expect.  But I'd say this is a pretty good buy. Well worth the money.ut I'd say this is a pretty good buy. Well worth the money.	2003-08-14

Eventually you'll find the need to grab a guide and while this isn't the best guide it helps to do SEVERAL things that the others here have not mentioned.<br />To begin, the pre-walkthrough in this guide is full of amazing detail and combat tips.  It gives off great strategies of how to battle and take down your opponets.  The game also has handy character bios and such as well as an arts list.  However, as handy as the arts list is the list has a couple of typos.  It's handy and helps but some arts they list off twice and for Sharon there's one art that isn't listed at all.<br />The Walkthrough is not done too badly. Before each section there's a map that points out items and other things. Then in the text it elaborates on the other points.  It list the monsters at the beginning and strategies for taking down each one in the area.  The guide won't take you to every item (that's what the maps are for!) but they give you an idea on where to find the ones that aren't in plain sight.  All the puzzle solutions are given perfectly.<br />There are a few problems that exist. For example the main portion of the walkthrough is fine but boss strategies, monster strategies and all around tips are in a strange font.  The font IS readable but it takes a while to distinguish between some letters (such as a \\"h\\" looks like an \\"b\\" in this font).<br />Screenshots are NOT crystal clear. It's a good thing that the screens you need actually can be used.  Some screens are blurry while others are too bright.<br />The guide covers ALL the hunters guild sidequests, the centaurion challenge, helps you get every recipe, helps out in the battle arena, gives you the low down on cooking and gardening.  The guide has a lot to offer really and it lives up to it all.<br />The guide has a complete monster list. It is all text but this isn't such a problem. Every monster is listed in here but I WISH they were listed IN the walkthrough.  The guide has them completely in the back.  The monster list also has a couple of typos.  None too serious (as long as the HP listed is correct I'm okay).  Thank goodness the ingame has a bar below each enemy.<br />The item, weapon and armor list give the same description as the game does.  No problem there, EVERY RPG guide does that so don't worry about that.  The skills list I was hoping would be much better described than the game did.<br />My biggest gripe with this guide is it doesn't help you find all the heaven's secrets! Some you will get such as when it helps you out on mini-games, hunters guild and a few other sidequests. But for some like finding the Supreme Weapons shop Heaven Secret it doesn't detail that at all!  It also doesn't help you find all the nicknames for characters.<br />So the overall effort is this: It will help you get through the game and take care of a few sidequests but it won't help you master the game.  The list have typos in them and while the walkthrough and extras help it isn't enough to help you get the full experience from Legaia 2.ough.  The guide has them completely in the back.

I mean, they only left out a bunch of sidequests and the walkthrough didn't have all the star dust locations and enemy stats were wrong and all, but hey! That walkthrough was really really nice...even if they forgot the maps. Alright, enough of that! Let's face it! This is NOT the way to master &quot;Legend of Dragoon&quot;.  The guide misses A LOT of stuff that any essential RPG guide SHOULD have.<br />First off, I really liked that prologue and game basics section a lot. In fact that's probably what got this guide a three. If you're new to Legend of Dragoon and you for some reason can't understand all this stuff the instruction booklet is throwing at you (or you got it and there was no instruction booklet) this section goes in-depth on the games basic tutorials and such.  They tell me everything about additions and such that this makes the guide pretty good at first glance.  The character bios were nice and they had most of there weapons listed. Keyword: Most.<br />Yeah, that introduction was great until I got further into the guide. The sidequests are all on one page and they're in a chart! No in-depth on them and they don't give off a strategy for Magician Faust at all. Not stats either. The Stardusts list and the items list were pretty good though.<br />The guide really falls in the walkthorugh.  Yeah, it's nice and easy to read but this is what the guide truly misses.  The walkthorugh is obviously rushed (that or this guide is actually &quot;unauthorized&quot;).  The walkthrough doesn't really point out all the items. There were several items I found that were not listed in the walkthorugh at all. All these items were off of the beaten path though and so I should think Prima went straight forward.<br />Their boss strategies actually aren't too bad. However, I hate that they constantly used Kongol and Albert all the time. My preference was different. I used Albert and Rose and the guide never gives off strategies to if you ever used Rose and while it didn't affect my strategy much at all (if it really actually did) it shows that they neglected characters and went straight for the gold.<br />Lastly, they wasted about three pages on a table chart for the Final Boss in which they used weak additions and did a lot of stupid stuff like wasting turns. They used weak additions like I said and again used Albert and Kongol making their Final Boss strategy useless in everyway possible.<br />Overall the guide was bad and unless you're stuck.  But this is not the guide to get if you're looking to discover the games secrets.<br />The good<br />+Nice Introduction<br />+Easy to use walkthrough<br />+Boss strategies that could actually help somewhat<br />The Bad<br />-They only used Albert and Kongol.

I have to give credit to the author because doing some of the feats in this game the way he did seemed nearly impossible at first but using Dan Birlew's strategies I managed to survive everything this game threw at me with no problems.<br />The walkthrough is much better written than their RE1 guide was. Not as many typos and they don't result to the Kill everything strategy that was previously used.  Puzzles are easily described and while the guide has points where it is difficult to read...you have to remember that Dan Birlew is an RE veteran so you can trust what he's trying to tell you in this guide.<br />What I like about this guide is that it is simply that, a guide. No spoilers, but rather right to the point in helping you get the best from your gaming, in helping you get through an area in the best way possible. They recomend what items you should drop (like that Knife that is only there to taunt you), and what room to drop it in.<br />They also have a very nice way of helping you adapt to the game, something I don't usually get out of strategy guides anymore.  Most guides wouldn't go into so much detail on the aspects of the game and helping you prepare to master it first. Most other guide would much rather jump into the walkthrough right away.<br />This guide is a companion when you go thorugh RE0, and not a guide that completely holds your hand.  Helpful hints and easy puzzle solutions as well as easy to see boss call outs. In other words, a nice organized walkthrough. I couldn't ask for anything more. This is the best RE guide I've seen from BradyGAMES since their N64 RE2 guide.  Great Guide, if you need help on RE0 you should definitely pick this up.	2003-07-22
US	48278407	RCG8EW0MWHEL5	0744002265	443815268	Metal Gear SolidÂ¿ 2: Substance(tm) Official Strategy Guide for Xbox (Brady Games)	Books	4	5	5	N	N	4.5 Great Job although a few unmentioned things	I have the PS2 version of this guide and since I've been out collecting guides lately, I decided to pick this one up.  Amazingly enough (or not really) this guide is about the same as the PS2 guide. Well, the Walkthrough part for the original SOL is.  The only bonus you get is the fact that this is XBOX (and if you get the PS2 MGS2: Substance, this is a better buy than that substance guide. Just remember that the controls are different).<br />Anyway, the biggest bonus is all those VR missions and Snake tails. Basically all the bonus stuff in MGS2: Substance.  The guide is worth the grab for all that.<br />However, all the problems with the PS2 guide still remain.  They don't go into any detail about the different difficulty levels in the guide. They tell you all the basic stuff but don't help you prepare for the next difficulty level. For example, the EXTREME difficulty level has several new additions that aren't in NROMAL mode that the guide simply won't detail, like when you must destroy more sensors at the Shell 1-2 Connecting Bridge.<br />The nice dog tag strategies are nice but my cheap trick to getting them still works fine. Wanna hear it? It's so simple and easy to do that I'll tell you right now! Once you get your hands on that coolant spray, get some easy dog tags by always putting a guard to sleep. Then walk to him and spray him until he wakes up. When he wakes up get behind him and have your gun pointing out BEFORE he comes to a stance. Do this and you'll shout FREEZE as soon as he's back on his feet.  Pretty easy huh? Simple.<br />Anyway, enough about secrets as this isn't a place to submit tips for the game.  Anyway, this is a good guide to get and if you buy the PS2 version of MGS2: Substance I'd recommend you get this guide rather than the PS2 guide...which overall will force you buy two guides (and all together you're paying the price of two guides! Meaning you'll have to buy the original MGS2: SOL guide and then the Substance guide for PS2 spending thirty dollars when you didn't have to).nding thirty dollars when you didn't have to).	2003-07-21
US	48278407	RBQ5PHZHG539M	1931886180	893979109	Versus Books Official Perfect Guide for Wild Arms 3	Books	2	5	5	N	N	Gosh its so...bad...one of VS. worse...	The only reason I gave this guide two stars was because it had a walkthrough.  Remember the good ol days? When Versus Books released all the good guides? You could never go wrong when you went with Versus Books.  I remember their FF7 guide...it was the greatest RPG guide ever made! Then came their Resident Evil 2 guide which is arguably their best (competing with their FF7 and MGS guide for that title), next was MGS and then Zelda 64 and they went on and on.<br />Is this guide another \\"homerun\\" like their Wild Arms 2 guide was?  No...in fact its one of their worse guides.  Versus Books has obviously started to fall where they once succeeded.  Ever since their Grandia II guide on PS2 (never saw the Dreamcast one but I've heard its the exact same) their guides have only grown worse.<br />First of all, the guide has a nice walkthrough but unlike past guides they don't have \\"Basic Training\\" section.  They don't even have character bios.  What ever happened to Versus Books going beyond your average strategy guide? Now they're BELOW your average strategy guide.  The guide goes directly into the walkthrough from the get go. No introductions or telling you how to use the books or anything.  They don't tell you stats for overworld monsters and the walkthorugh is full of typos. There was a key point in the game where I was supposed to return to Little Rock.  The guide said I had to return to little twister, and while it was easy to differentiate it took a moment because the game didn't say where to go next at that point.<br />The item appensix isn't detailed but they did cover the Millenium Puzzles.  Also, while they didn't take the fun out of te game the walkthrough was very bland and unintersting to read. It was as if a robot was talking to me in my mind.  What's worse? Not enough screenshots.  They showed ONE measly screenshot for each task to do when you may need a few more.<br />Also, this guide has no bestiary and that isn't a problem but they also do not tell you overworld monster stats. Also, should an enemy reappear in another dungeon, the guide forces you to flip back several pages (much like their Grandia II guide did).<br />My biggest gripe...well not so big gripe, was that they gave no tips on how to raise your ARMS which I could've used some suggestions.  Another small gripe that I had was that they didn't detail personal skills or arcana very well. I would've like if they had an Arcana table in the back or something but they coudln't even do that! It's all in the walkthrough which is an endless amount of pages!<br />The only reason to get this guide would be for the EX File Keys and puzzle solutions.  Everything else is pretty much useless, no good boss strategies that only tell you to attack and heal. They don't tell you what to expect from a boss like they did in past guides.  Maps are also very undetailed with minor flaws but they're difficult to navigate.<br />Lastly, the world map isn't drawn to scale and they're missing some locations! Not only that but they don't give good directions in the walkthrough to get to those areas.<br />Now for those red hot juicy secrets that Versus Books is really good at collecting.  Wait...umm...there are no cheap tricks anymore! They cover basic secrets already mentioned in the game.  They don't help you defeat secret bosses (no overall strategy like they did in WA2 guide.). They give you EX-File keys and they explain the secrets of \\"Finest Arts\\" but they don't cover the cheap tricks you can do (There IS an infinite money trick for this game!) and they don't tell you what you can steal from enemies either!<br />Overall, there is no reason to waste money on this guide. The last good RPG guide I saw from Versus books was Grandia Xtreme. Now that was a good versus books guide, but eversince WA2 and their Pokemon guides, I haven't seen any good RPG guide (or very many good guides period) from Versus Books.  Whatever happened to going BEYOND the game?  Leave this on the shelf and go to GameFAQs.com for game info.and go to GameFAQs.com for game info.	2003-07-20

Of all the Pokemon Ruby/Sapphire guides this is the only one that has a Pokedex.  But it still isn't tbe best to choose just because of this.<br />A few things troubling. THey have some maps and that's good. But they don't locate very many items. Not only that but there are a couple of errors in the Pokedex, which weren't too bad. Mostly with some of the pokemons evolutions but still a good guide nonetheless.<br />The other big problem was that I'm used to guides telling me what to expect from trainers.  Even Nintendo Power would help tell me what trainers would most likely use (i.e. &quot;They mostly use water and grass types&quot;), but this guide didn't do that for me.<br />Also, they didn't locate the secret bases in any way whatsoever. They had the maps...but where do I find them!?  I didn't like that too much. Not only that but no strategies for two on two battles. That could be a bit of a problem.  Nonetheless a good guide that is essential to the game in every way. They have a few problems but easily this guide is one of the better ones for Pokemon Ruby/Sapphire.<br />The good<br />+Maps<br />+Nice walkthrough<br />+There's a Pokedex!<br />The Bad<br />-Small tiny errors in the Pokedex<br />-Doesn't help me locate the secret bases<br />-Maps are missing item locations	2003-07-05

What Prima has created is a guide that utalizes what it has. Everything in the guide has a purpose and Prima was entitled to enforce it.  The guide looks really great and detailed but if you take a closer look things can quickly go awry for the gamer wanting to master the game.<br />The guide begins by showing you all the characters and job classes the game has to offer as well as the Psyenergy used on the field. The job classes chart is really nice, telling you how to change into each class but it has a few typos. After this you're off into the walkthrough.<br />Unfortunately the walkthrough is where the problem is.  It shows more so in the first one than the second but what you'll first notice is how disorganized the guide is at times.  The information is all over place!<br />As I also mentioned the guide utilizes everything.  The guide will point you to an area you'll have to be at but it won't walk you there.  They expect you to use the maps.  The screenshots are clear but a bit dark at times.  Not only that but because the guide is written in four columns the screenshots stack up on each other like nothing else.  So its hard to use the screens because they're not organized in the walkthrough.<br />The walkthrough is also comprised into &quot;chapters&quot; for both games. Each chapter begins with a checklist for everything you'll do for that &quot;chapter&quot;.  Easy checklist and it'll get you through the game but with much trouble.  It also depicts the Djinn you'll get and the Psyenergy as well.<br />The guide misses two key points that are important in any RPG guide.  One, there's no enemies list or bestiary of any kind! When you get into a battle with an enemy you're unfamiliar with, you know nothing about the enemy.  How much HP and PP does the enemy have? The guide won't tell you.  The other major point the guide is missing is the lack of a world map.  You CAN find towns with this guide but it gives you directions.  The directions are vague, really.  An RPG guide NEEDS a World Map because an RPG is all about exploring.<br />The guide does do some things fairly well, however.  The guide has detailed boss strategies (even if they are out of context).  The boss strategies will help you conquer every foe with relative ease.  The guide also has really detailed maps to guide you through it all.  The maps show you the location of items and as I said, navigate you.<br />The last problem is that this guide doesn't cover all the optional areas in the first Golden Sun, moreover the Crossbone Island.<br />The appendices in the guide are breathtakingly detailed and they have lists for both games if you need it.  So if you're confused on what an item does or what a piece of armor can do this guide will tell you without question.<br />Basically this is a guide that's great for someone looking to complete the game and nothing more. If you want to get up and go through the game with a helping hand then by all means grab this guide.  If you want to master everything the game has to offer the guide falls short at the secrets and sidequest section.with this guide but it gives you directions.  The directions are vague, really.

They cover all the VR missions and Snake tails and all the bonus stuff that MGS2 substance has to offer but that's all you get from this guide. Should you buy MGS2 substance on PS2 and you've never played the original SOL package and you want help for the main storyline you'd have to go out and buy TWO guides if its the PS2 version you're getting. That is, if you want the full walkthrough for the adventure. Otherwise you'll have to go and purchase the Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty Official Strategy Guide.<br />Yeah, this guide covers all the extras in a nice easy to read way, but if you went through the story of the original MGS2 and you're looking for a guide to that, you'll end up purchasing two guides. My solution to this, go out and buy the XBOX version of this guide. Its the exact same AND it covers the whole story mode walkthrough. That way you'll only spend fifteen dollars rather than blowing off thirty.	2003-06-25
US	48278407	R3JJQS4DHSCLGP	0744002532	811634165	Final Fantasy Origins: Official Strategy Guide	Books	5	10	10	N	N	Definitely Worth Your Money	This guide is clearly one of the better guides I've seen from BradyGAMES.  Its much better than their Final Fantasy Anthology guide and a great deal better than the Final Fantasy Chronicles. I have about two small gripes with the guide (see below) but I couldn't decide if that should make me lower the rating or not.  But since a 4.5 would round up to 5. Theres my decision.<br />First, the Final Fantasy I section.  This section is relatively short compared to the 150 Pages for FFII.  Anyhow, this leads you through the game from start to finish while explaining the job classes and even gives advice on what job classes you should assign your characters at the start. It also has a complete bestiary and tells you how to complete your collection data.  All secrets revealed.  This section also tells you the difference between the Normal and Easy modes.  It also tells you what stats go up at what levels for your job classes.  However, they didn't go deep enough into the job classes.  To me this wasn't a problem but to others it could be. My only gripe with this section of the guide is that they didn't give very good Boss strategies.  They were all typically the same lentgh and repeated the same thing over and over for every strategy (attack and keep your HP up).  They don't go too far into detail to tell you what to expect from bosses.<br />The Final Fantasy II section is done in pretty much the same manner as Final Fantasy.  Its just longer because well....FFII is longer than FFI.  The FFII section tells you entirely what to expect from the game before beginning.  They tell you how to make the best of your characters stats and give a nice little tip on how to bring your characters stats up much faster.  This section also has a complete bestiary.  The boss strategies are far more detailed than in the Final Fantasy I section....until you get to the point where you get the Bloodsword.  Eventhough the Bloodsword is a wonder on bosses (you can take most of them out in one shot!) if you're like me you want difficulty.  But because they were busy telling me to use the bloodsword, they never fully told me what attacks I should expect.<br />Now to tell you about the guide as a whole.  It covers both games from start to finish with few spoilers.  Well, no spoilers under FFI.  There were some under FFII but to complain would be childish, being that FFII was so predictable in the first place.  But anyhow, my only major problem with this guide is that they didn't provide a world map for either game!  Its relatively easy to get lost and lose your way in these games at times. Not always, but the in-game world maps don't help out much. A small little gripe is that when it comes to the dungeons, the maps don't label the floors.  So if you go from B1 to B2 you have to look for the corresponding number to find out where you are.  But in the final dungeon of FFII be forewarned that you can't really do that.  Therefore, they should've labled the floors.<br />This may not sound like much, but this guide also makes it so you absolutely don't have to open up your instruction booklet if you actually care enough to read it.<br />Oh, and one last thing. I'm much happier that BradyGAMES stopped putting all the shop list before the walkthrough and actually put them IN the walkthrough. It makes for a lot less page flipping.<br />Overall its 4.5 stars...<br />On the positive side...<br />+Covers both games very well<br />+Job classes covered in FFI<br />+Tips on raising characters covered in FFII<br />+Complete Bestiaries for both games<br />+No more stupid shop lists before the walkthough. They're now in the walkthrough.<br />But for everything good there's always something bad....<br />-FFI boss strategies {are disappointing}<br />-FFII boss strategies aren't helpful after finding the bloodsword<br />-No World Maps!<br />-Maps need to be more detailed<br />I couldn't subtract a star being that the guide does fulfill the soul purpose, and thats to get you throughthe game.	2003-05-12

First of all, I guess the walkthrough does get you through the game so it does something for you.  I didn't mind no secrets since the game doesn't really have any, but I must say that the guide is highly disorganized, the walkthrough looks like it was written with inexperience of the game.<br />I don't mean to be cruel to the guide, but it truly was poorly done and they call this thing \\"Perfect\\"?  Thats kinda sad.... and why in the world would you make an RPG guide that just goes into the walkthrough after the very first flip of a page.  No comprehensive coverage of spells, nothing on the characters moves at all!  They claim to have coverage on the skills books but they have absoluely nothing on them!  There wasn't a separate section for enemies either, and the boss strategies were really bad.  They were the same thing over and over \\"cancel his attack and then use your special moves, heal when you need to\\" and then I come to a boss I can't cancel.<br />The walkthrough is highly out of context.  You read about a boss and then its on the next page.  They didn't want to leave space or something I guess...also theres one page where they wrote the text over an items list....  The maps were okay I guess, can't really be used for anything but finding items (look at past RPG guides from VS and you'll see what I mean).  No background on characters at all. The guides items list was okay...magic list and special moves list {was bad} though they didn't tell me anything.<br />Also, the guide is all about the walkthrough.  There are absolutely NO game basics or battle tips.  They don't explain about the Special Coins or the Magic Coins, they assume you already know all this stuff! Yet they still have the nerve to say its \\"Perfect\\"? What are you ON Versus?<br />My advice...just go through the game without this guide you won't need it...it won't help you anyway and believe me this could've been like ten times better.	2002-11-06

The guide is a little disorganized, but with some very detailed maps.  The screens are clear and in the approriate spots, but in some spots they needed more.  Arwing Missions aren't very handy at all, but the boss strategies are pretty good.<br />As stated, the walkthrough is great!  Its in-depth and tells you where all the items are and the like.  The maps, while great, don't have the number callouts that are in the text so you'll most definitely be spending more time reading than playing.<br />Probably one of gripes with this guide was that there was no game basics section or &quot;basic training&quot;.  I know there is an instruction booklet, but sometimes you might buy it used and there is none, but not because of that.  This is because I was hoping that VERSUS would do what they always do, give combat tips.  They don't help you get adjusted to the game at all.<br />I did like that there was a separate section for just the fuel cels however, and for those Bombardad things, the map appendix is totally useless though and to me was a complete waste of paper.<br />Now for my biggest gripe.  They covered almost NO secrets whatsoever.  If they did, then its all in the walkthrough making you flip through endless pages.  It was a good guide though, better than the Official one from Nintendo, but there was just that small bit of disorganization.  It seemed a little rushed.<br />OVERALL:<br />The Good:<br />+Detailed Maps<br />+In-depth walkthrough<br />+Some of the best boss strategies for SFA<br />+Crystal clear screens<br />The Bad:<br />-No game basics or fighting tips!<br />-Needed more screens to make statements clear<br />-The walkthrough is disorganized<br />And the UGLY:<br />-Where the hell are the secrets!?

But only 4.5 stars	This is a pretty good guide.  I only have about two or three small problems with the guide (see below) but to be truthful it really is one of the best and most well-organized RPG guide I've seen.<br />To start off, if you want a guide that won't take the fun out of WA3-then this one is for you!  There are not plot spoilers in the guide making it more useful.  <br />The walkthrough is well organized and easy to use.  Its quick, organized, and most importantly, to the point! With beautifully done maps, and clear screens. The boss strategies are good at first, but then begin to lack a little.  Not to mention that the guide doesn't give a strategy for optional bosses, but it will say the stats at least.<br />You can find all 15 EX keys relatively easily with this guide in hand.  They also have all the Millenium puzzle solutions, and all the side quest.<br />The world map is nice but as in most RPG games nowadays you probably won't need it. The other gripe I had, as I have with RPG guides from VERSUS off the past is that they have no battle tips for beginners and no game basics! What kind of guide doesn't help you get adjusted to the game first?<br />Oh well, moving on, the items list could've used more detail than I got from it, but hey, its still there so don't worry about it. It would have also been better to have an Arcana list in the back instead of making me fish through the walkthrough.<br />OVERALL: This was a great guide.  Not a &quot;Perfect&quot; guide (their WA2 guide was much better) but not a &quot;Strategy&quot; Guide either.  Its more like you companion rather than just a book that gets worn on the shelf.<br />POSITIVE<BR>+Detailed maps<BR>+Organized walkthrough<BR>+No story spoilers<BR>+Find all 15 Ex keys<BR>+Millenium puzzle solutions<BR>+All side quests and secrets<br />NEGATIVE<BR>-No game basics and battle tips<BR>-No strategies for most optional bosses<br />Pretty good guide.

You can't get any better than this right now.  The BradyGAMES Signature series continues with Kingdom Hearts.  This guide is jampacked with detail after detail, maps upon maps, and boss stategies upon boss strategies of help!<br />However, there is at least ONE spoiler in the guide (the only spoiler actually) that you may want to wait and it just so happens to be in the last few pages (in other words the final boss), so take your time with this one and use as you go through the game and don't be like me and read the whole walkthrough before you even start!<br />BUT the guide has so much to offer.  Fully detailed map that pin-point the location of items and trinitys.  Boss tatics that will actually lead you to victory against some of he toughest bosses in the game with NO plot spoilers whatsoever (and thats a good thing cuz this storyline was absolutely breathtaking)!<br />Tips on how to customize your characters and list of abilities!

There are a few problems, but nothing that made me want to rip the guide up or anything like that.<br /><br />The walkthrough is in a very good layout. It's organized, and very easy to follow, and much more descriptive than the Grandia II guide was. The guide is so easy to use and so accurate in the information it gives out.  It doesn't tell you what's in the chest, but that doesn't matter (the chest are random).  What I was disappointed about is that the guide doesn't point out that chest aren't always in the same spots.  In short, while the maps are really detailed, they're not needed when it comes to finding where certain chests are.<br /><br />The boss strategies are extremely detailed.  It's more than just telling you to cancel and heal.  This is the first guide I've seen from VERSUS BOOKS where they give you the low down on a bosses attacks!  They'll tell you what to look out for, what dangers it causes, and the best way to go about it by recommending characters.  Those who read the Grandia II or Wild Arms 2 guide know that VERSUS doesn't do that too often.<br /><br />Before each section in the walkthrough they give you an enemy list and tell you the average HP.  This wasn't needed, however as the game tells you how much HP they have, and besides, the enemies level up (but the average HP isn't wrong; it is listed as AVERAGE HP).  The maps are brutally detailed, but monster groups and such aren't always depicted in the right place.  The way the walkthrough is organized using the maps works almost flawlessly.  On the map are number call outs.  Whenever you see one of those numbers, look for that number in the text and you'll know what to do.  Organization!<br /><br />The character bios are lovely.  They go into so much detail as to tell you what each characters strength in combat is, how many skill books and Mana eggs they can equip, and when the best time to use them would be.<br /><br />The moves list is detailed.  They tell you the combinations to get more moves, and who pulls the combo off.  This is good because the game doesn't point them out to you.<br /><br />The items list and such is also detailed very well.  I think we all know what an items list looks like so let's move on.  There's another moves list in the back that gives you a bit more detail than just how to obtain it.  Here they also go into the effect of it, and tell you how many times you need to use a move to level it up.<br /><br />After all that stuff we have the skills list.  This list gives you the down and dirty of all the skills.  There is also a list of skill books for your convience.  Of course, there are a grip of secrets to unearth, and the guide helps you unearth just about all of them.<br /><br />There is one flaw with the guide.  I don't think it's a huge one, but it is a reoccuring one in VERSUS BOOKS guides.  There is no game basics.  Grandia Xtreme is a complex game, and the instruction manuel just doesn't explain all there is to be explained.  For me, I bought the game used so there WAS NO manuel.  I was hoping the guide could help me learn what the manuel could've.  But it didn't, and it was sad.  The battle system is complex and for those who hadn't played a Grandia game before, it'll confuse you at first.  In order to learn the basics, I had to go to GameFAQs to learn what a strategy guide should've been there to teach me.<br /><br />Finally, I was impressed that they told you the combinations to getting all the Mana Eggs, but they should've done a chart.  That way I wouldn't be searching through the whole list just to see what I was going to get.<br /><br />This is a great guide.  If you need help with Grandia Xtreme, pick up this guide.  Just know that this is not \\"Grandia for dummies,\\" you SHOULD know the game before getting it and using it, as it doesn't review (and that really isn't a bad thing, which is why I still gave it five stars).  This is probably one of the best RPG guides out there, so get it, utilize it, and have fun.and have fun.	2002-10-04

What a shame that for Super Mario Sunshine there are Four! I really couldn't decide, but this one saying \\"Perfect Guide\\" is something to catch your eye.  Its gotta be good right? Well, yes and no.<br />This guide is nothing but Game Basics and Walkthrough!  The game basics is pretty good but the other three guides were way better than this.<br />To start off, the guide fills the sould purpose and thats to get you through the game.  They locate every blue coin, help you get every shine, and even call out new enemies. The maps are good but they just look like one giant screen shot.  The maps lack detail that the other guides had.  The walkthrough also wasn't as organized as the other three, and the walkthrough gets confusing at times.  This is because in places where they really needed screenshots they didn't have them.<br />Its also sad that they thought by just giving you a map appendix in the back of the book, they think you'll follow that instead.  I don't want to keep flipping back and forth.  The guide is unclear most of the time.  They didn't cover the game that in-depth, and didn't really \\"guide\\" you through anything.<br />Screenshots may be clear but at most points where they need screens they don't have any.  The maps aren't detailed either.  They're just one big screenshot.  Yes, they are nice eye candy, no, they really won't help that much.  The map appendix points some things out. M<br />y advice is to get the Official Guide from Nintendo Power.  Its much better then this one and is more organized, maybe the others ones are better too.  The guide doesn't have any real strategy.<br />OVERALL<br />The good<br />+Crystal clear screens<br />+Good game basics<br />+There's a walkthrough<br />+There are maps<br />The Bad<br />-Some maps are just screens<br />-Not enough screenshots<br />-A little thin (if they didn't have a map appendix it would barely be 110 pages)<br />-Walkthrough is disorganized	2002-09-22

These guides are very in-depth and after the Devil May Cry guide got this off to a great start, the Onimusha 2 guide keeps it going.  I'll give you tons of reason why this is the best Strategy Guide (in my opinion) then any other Onimusha guide out there.<br />First of all, like any guide (or hopefully any guide), there is the walkthrough.  This walkthrough is very in-depth with ultra detailed maps that pin-point every item!  The walkthough is precise and quite possibly one of the most in-depth organized walkthrough from BradyGAMES to date.  The author does a great job explaining the strategies, and talks about the better approach for Offensive and defensive battle tatics against bosses.<br />The game basics section is for me especially. If you don't feel you get enough explanation on attacks etc. from the instruction booklet (like me) then the game basics section does a great job on explaining just how to get critical hits, when is best to attack and when its best to just haul you butt out of there.<br />There is also a list included for trading items.  The only gripe I have with this list (and the guide) is that this trading list isn't in alphabetical order, meaning you'll be reading up and down the list just to find if the item is worth trading to another.  But they do explain how to trade and tell you what you'll get too!<br />The alliances to form are listed in the back of the book in a flowchart.  This shows you just what path to take!  But it also explains just how you should form alliances as well.  They tell you what the benefits are as well.<br />The secrets and sidequests and telling you how to use each character (combos and everything are explained).  The side quest are brillantly outlined and easy to use.  They tell you who gets what too. The secrets also explain a lot about the different difficulty levels and the Man in Black mini game.<br />Lastly, the guide completely covers the Oni mini game with a tear out wall scroll to go along with it.  This is a great guide and if you're going to get Onimusha 2 then you should definitely get this book!<br />On the Positive side:<br />+Great Maps!<br />+Great Strategies!<br />+Crystal Clear screens with helpful captions<br />+Hey!

Detailed Maps, complete walkthrough for both games and all.  The heart pieces are revealed, and so are the secrets of linking (some of them anyway), and does cover both games.<br />The good thing about this guide is the organization in the walkthrough.  They do that little number thing pretty well in the Ages section, but its better organized in the Seasons sections (The Ages section was written by Casey Loe and the Seasons section was written by Craig Keller, as a little FYI). Both sections have a ring appendix (but they only needed one and they printed two that are exactly the same), a table of contents and the walkthrough.  Thats it!<br />But what about Heart pieces?  And secrets of Linking?  That is all in the walkthrough.  You have to either read the walkthrough or use the table of contents to find all the Linking Passwords and all the heart pieces. It probably would've been easier to have a section dedicated to both of them separately.  But you only have so little time to do things.<br />The boss strategies and mini-boss strategies are done very well in Seasons but not as well in Ages.  Where as Ages does a good job in guiding you through dungeons the Seasons has better boss strategies.  Overall they get the purpose done.  But they don't cover \\"Hero's Dungeon\\" in a linked game, and there is artwork in both sections that sometimes gets in the way of Maps and screenshots.<br />As another reviewer mentioned, its all about the walkthrough.  I actually read the entire walkthrough. (Look if it helps you understand why I did that I'm a big collector of game guides so its a hobby of mine I read the walkthrough before I actually use it). Anyway, I read the entire walkthrough and believe me Almost everything you needto know is in the walkthrough!  So truly this is a great guide since it actually does detail all that it says it does. The only really big gripe with this guide (but there are plenty of little gripes if you look below) is that the guide has no enemy list.<br />Also, on the number system they use.  Next to point 1 it'll say something like \\"bomb the cracked wall\\" but it isn't clear enough because they don't have a screen and the \\"1\\" just so happens to be covering up what they're talking about.  Also, this isn't as important but the Ages section of the guide looks a little rushed.<br />Overall:<br />On the positive side:<br />+Great Maps<br />+Great boss strategies in Seasons<br />+Good organization in both sections<br />+Linking game Finale is covered OK<br />+Complete walkthrough discusses everything<br />+Crystal Clear screenshots<br />+Walkthrough explains everyhing in a simple easy to understand form.<br />But on the negative side<br />-Artwork blocks maps and screens at some places<br />-Ages section looks too rushed making tons of errors (but still lives up to the purpose and VERSUS BOOKS name)<br />-Hero's Dungeon isn't covered<br />-Heart Pieces and Linking Passwords must be searched for in the Walkthrough<br />-Ring appendix is the same description that Vasu gives you...not very helpful<br />-Lastly, Enemies aren't listed in the guide also forcing you to read the walkthrough for them too.<br />OVERALL: This is a great guide.

This tells you about the difference between Gold and Silver and Crystal.  The walkthrough is very organized and not so many errors are in the guide.  The walkthrogh also explains how often Pokemon appear on routes, and tells what pokemon each trainer in each area has.  I STILL Say you shouldn't trust what they say about the Pokemon, experiment.  Also the guide as a sense of humor as well (good ol' Casey Loe).<br />Now are you ready for the best part?  The Pokedex is the most detailed Pokedex of all time!  Better then their Pokemon Gold&Silver guide and the Pokemon Yellow guide! However, the pokedex is like 160 pages long!  Thats more than half the guide!

No basics of the game or anything, just the walkthrough.  Thats about all this guide has, while indeed the walkthrough is good, I couldn't really let this guide slide away with five starts with all that could've been included<br />First of all, the guide begins with the characters.  There is no description in the characters at all!  The explanations are very incomplete.  Also, boss strategies are out of context, you'll be reading and then the boss will be past where they orginally described him to be.<br />The walkthrough is complete and simple to read.  Detailed maps and very lavish and crystal clear screens.  Though some items that were pointed out on the map are wrong, the walkthrough gets the purpose of the guide down.  But boss strategies need a little work.<br />The biggest problem I had with this guide was how lazy the staff was.  I mean, they didn't explain or even list the abilities learned from the skill books, and the guide doesn't have a bestiary!  Enemy listings are there, but you're constantly having to flip back a page or two.  The other problem was that they didn't explain much of any of the secrets of mini-games and spend he night events.<br />The guide is also very thin.  Only 104 pages, actually its only 97 if you cut out the artwork and order form in the back.  Thats kinda sad especially for a game like Grandia II.  The guide lacks detail.<br />OVERALL:<BR>Positive<BR>+There is a walkthrough<BR>+Clear Screenshots<BR>+No Plot Spoilers<BR>+Nice Maps<br />Negative<BR>-No Bestiary<BR>-No Secrets described (thats not too big)<BR>-No lists for your skill books<BR>-Boss strategies need work<BR>-Walkthrough organization is very screwed up<BR>-No basics to the game they don't explain how to gain magic or battle or explain skill books<BR>-Bosses are called out of context	2002-04-21
US	48278407	R1EQ794EAYE1B9	0316693200	309666534	2nd Chance	Books	5	2	2	N	N	Raises low spirits after his last novel	In my opinion, the latest Alex Cross novel \\"Violets Are Blue\\" was one of the biggest let downs in my known life.  Actually, sorry to say, but the Cross series is starting to get old.  But with the new series that got off to a great start with \\"1st to Die\\" we can celebrate and rejoice as this one is much worth while page turner.<br />The book takes place just about where \\"1st to Die\\" left off.  Lindsay Boxer is to me what Cross was when the Cross novels were good (meaning before \\"Violets Are Blue\\").  The womens murder club returns and this time they meet a killer that is very clever and unsuspecting.<br />The book brings back some of the past, which lets you know much more about Lindsay Boxer.  So if you like character developement as much as I do, then this isn't a bad thing.  But if you want the book to get to the action then forget the book it isn't much worth your time.<br />I, on the other hand, love character developement and plot twist.  This book is chock full of plot twist!  The book actually DOES leave you guessing until the end.  Unlike most of his past novels where the villian comes out before your even to part 2.<br />The book is full of great complex plot twist, and if you like an emotional story that won't make you cry (that's me too, Patterson just comepletely got me here!) then this is definitely worth the read.<br />Overall: After \\"Violets Are Blue\\" was disappointing.  Patterson's \\"2nd Chance\\" is a thrill ride that will leave you guessing until the end.  Not only that but the book doesn't have a cliff-hanger ending like the Alex Cross novels do.	2002-03-15

The only up over the official guide is that it has a recommended Junctions list.<br />To start off, the walkthrough is like reading an FAQ at GameFAQS.com, in other words, no screenshots, no maps, just words.  Oh, did I mention that the pages are purple?  Not to mention that you could easily go to Gamespot.com and find this EXACT SAME GUIDE only you'll have it for free.<br />There are no stats for bosses and almost no strategy is involved in the guide whatsoever.  The guide needs more work because of the fact that with no screens and absolutely no strategy, it leaves for big improvements.  If you go to gamespot though, they actually have screenshots.<br />The only other step above the official guide is that the guide has a final boss strategy.  Its just a shame that the strategy is so horrible that it can't be done.<br />Now for the secrets. Umm.....what secrets? Oh thats right, the guide has none!  I was thinking \\"hey its an unauthorized guide, it might have more secrets than the official\\", well, I was wrong about that.  Luckily I returned the guide and got my money back.<br />let this be a lesson.  Look before you buy, for the love of god look at the guide before you buy it.  Now if this was a guide for FFIX it would've been better than the official guide by a long shot.<br />Overall: If you like GameFAQs and like to pay for guides when you could see the exact same thing online, this is the perfect guide for you!

This guide was not very helpful to me at all.  Almost no detail in the maps, didn't help out with puzzles (thats not too big but it could've explained how to get the solution), some screenshots in the wrong place and some misleading information.<br />First of all, the walkthrough is very dull.  It'll tell you how to get to certain areas, but I found several screenshots in the wrong place, and the walkthrought moved very quickly.  There wasn't enough detail to tell me what I'm running into.  They don't tell you how enemy placements work, or what items could be replaced as.<br />The Quick-Decisions card was nice, but I could've gotten along without it.  Also, the guide doesn't tell you what items nemesis drops.  While it would tell me sometimes, something was always missing.<br />The puzzle solutions that they claim to be there, aren't really there.  They hardly tell you how to get to a solution.  For example at one point in the guide when your searching for a password it reads and I quote &quot;Just look around for a while and bingo! (That's not the password).&quot;  The problem with this?  What am I looking for?  I don't know!  It just tells me to look around.  Every other guide I saw told me EXACTLY what I was looking for at that point in the game.<br />The maps are from the ingame so of course they have no level of detail in them, making the maps useless.  The only thing this guide really did state to me were the secrets.  However, it didn't cover too much about the rankings or the mini-game.<br />My Advice, VERSUS BOOKS and BradyGAMES made a guide to RE3 and they're much better than this. (The BradyGAMES guide even tells you what's in Jill's diary!)  So you might want to looke away from Prima for this guide.	2002-01-28

There is no way I can let this book slide with a four!  This book compared to ROSES ARE RED was a pretty bad book.  I loved the previous book so I picked this up.  Boy was I surprised.<br />First of all, if you haven't read ROSES ARE RED than don't read this book because this will completely spoil the book for you.  The Mastermind returns (as if we don't already know who he is!) in this book....well sorta.  What I mean is Patterson went and explained the plot with the vampires for the first like 100 chapters. Then for the last 16 it was all the mastermind!<br />Now, is it just me, or was the vampire plot a little corney and predictable?  Well it was. You can easily figure out who the sire is.  The plot involving the vampires and such was not a very good one.<br />Now for you Alex Cross fans out there.  Is this book really worth it to the fans of the Cross series.  Well, not really.  Allow me to explain.  Alex is usually a logical, strong person.  In Violets he ain't very strong.  In fact he pretty much turned into a coward.  Don't get me wrong! I like Alex Cross, but in this book he wasn't the best and he was too busy being scared of getting close to someone rather than solving the case.<br />How Cross figures out who the mastermind is ...(pretty bad) too.  He usually figures stuff out more logically than that.  In this he simply looked across the street! Does that mean he could've seen anybody and jumped to the conclusion that the one he saw was the Mastermind?  It seems so.  While I was surprised with how Cross caught the Mastermind though.<br />The character developement is all wrong.  The characters seem like completely different people!  Sampson (crosses partner) doesn't even play a large part in this book the way he did in the previous ones!<br />I know this deals with Cross' personal issues but where was the action that kept me on the edge of my seat the way \\"Kiss the Girls\\" or \\"Pop Goes the Weasel\\" did?  What happened to his \\"formula\\"? It was working perfectly until now!<br />Well, as far as short chapters go I was okay with it.  Being that when I get home after a long day I'm exhausted, and like to stop on chapters.  Now when I come home after a long day.  I usually read.  I hate stopping in the middle of a chapter though.  So I can't read a book where the chapters are like 40 pages!  But when I see Patterson books I'm usually saying \\"I'm tired, but I can scrounge up three pages.\\"<br />Anyway, I'm a James Patterson fan, but this book was just as bad as \\"Cradle and All\\" was! I doubt this much, but the book was probably worse than that one.  If you like Alex Cross I guess its worth a try, but other than that you should probably stay away from this book and go find a better one like \\"Roses Are Red\\" or maybe \\"Along Came a Spider.\\"  But this book just isn't worth it.fectly until now!<br />Well, as far as short chapters go I was okay with it.

Okay, as much as the next person I like maps too, and while this guide didn't have any, that doesn't matter cuz the level of detail in the walkthrough was good enough for me!<br />The amount of time they took to put this guide together makes this a very good guide.  They were very content on helping you get started in a section dedicated to completely helping you learn the basics.  They explain the use of items.  The explain all the enemies and ways to defeat them.<br />The walkthrough was very good.  While it didn't have maps who cares?  The other two guides had maps and they weren't even the best! What made the walkthrough good was that they had a quick reference guide in the back and that was only to help you find mushrooms, ace coins, and yoshi eggs if you wanted to get through the level in a hurry.  Crystal clear screenshots basically dominated.<br />The secrets were well done while I still was able to find some tricks that I was stupidly trying out to see if they worked (and did but hey they were stupid), they actually told me what would happen if I got all the Ace coins in the game, they actually TOLD me what would happen if I collected all the yoshi eggs too.<br />They completely covered the Super Mario Bros. classic very easily.  The guide was so detailed.  I have to recommend this guide out to anyone there is.  While it still isn't the best its better than the other two I saw.  Keep this in mind because the guide is very decent and well put together.	2002-01-11

It has detailed maps, great walkthrough, boss strategies, and bestiary, plus much more where that came from.<br />The best part about this guide is that there is no referall to playonline every paragraph, and boss strategy.  The guide is actually concerned with helping you get through the game rather than trying to get you to explore a new website.<br />The walkthrough is very detailed.  Again, they tell you all the objectives and then explain it all.  The maps are detailed showing you the location of every item in an area, and if it doesn't than it tells you in the walkthrough. The guide also doesn't spoil the plot and there are no story spoilers in the guide. The walkthrough also has crystal clear screenshots. Also, enemies in an area are listed so you don't have to flip back through to the bestiary all those 100+ pages. Also the maps are right there in the walkthrough rather than in the back of the book.<br />The boss strategies actually help you.  They display the HP and AP the boss haves, the amount of damage needed to trigger an overkill, and the weakness, half damage, immunity, absorbtion listing.<br />The bestiary is quite possibly the best I've seen. They list the number of HP it has, they list how much damage you need to do in parenthasis to get an overkill and they list the number of AP the enemy gives.  They also list status effects you can do to the boss, and the sensor reading below.  Not to mention the items they drop and how much gil it takes to bribe them, and what you can steal. The only problem is that the bestiary doesn't tell you where you can find the enemy to fight him.<br />The guide has a sphere chart and a listing of all the overdrives and what it takes to make each character learn them.  The sphere grid pin-points out everything (Ability nodes, HP nodes etc.) so that you may decide what route they take.<br />Every secret is revealed and all the side quest are fully exploited in the guide.  Airship passwords revealed, coordnates also revealed.<br />A poster also comes with the guide and shows you the sphere grid on one side, and the Rikku's overdrive Mix chart on the other.  Being that the sphere grid is in the guide you should probably put it up on the mixing chart.<br />Secret Aeons and legendary weapons are revealed, and in the back of the book are exclusive interviews with the creators of Final Fantasy X.  If you want to learn of the development of FFX look at these interviews.<br />Lastly, the guide completely covers Blitzball!  It covers the teams, free agents, and gives you a stats chart for everysingle player of the sport.  Letting you know who to hire and you may want to pass up.  It tells you of all the Blitzball Basics.<br />Have I left anything out? Well, aside from character bios and overdrive listings this guide is pretty much all you need for FFX.  I can't find too many errors in the guide so I'd say that this is the best FFX guide you can buy.ide what route they take.<br />Every secret is revealed and all the side quest are fully exploited in the guide.

After that FFIX guide I thought this guy would be bad. Anyways, to start off. I've been a HUGE collector of video game guides (I may be 15 and have high expectations for a guide such as they do need to help me a give me a gaming experience in the process) and I know a good guide when I see it.<br />This guide is defenitely good. Anyways, I read the other reviews, and Dan Birlew didn't do the Xenogears guide nor did David Cassady, it was Ronald Wartow, its right there on the fron cover. The maps are easy to read while I do admit they get tiresome every guide does. I know the maps aren't done by Dan Birlew but still they could use a little work. I look more at the detail in the walkthrough rather than how flashy the maps and screenshots are.<br />The walkthrough helps you out a lot and doesn't give off any spoilers at all and gets right to the point. I like this guide because the walkthrough is put together organized and doesn't look like it was rushed to get out. Its 160 pages and the guide has extremely good detail to it. Unlike the Prima (only 90 pages) and VERSUS BOOKS (112 pages) this guide has a ton of info.<br />I'd recomend this guide for anybody who likes strategy guides as much as I do.	2001-12-12

Not for Those Wanting to Master the Game	Metal Gear Solid games are not known to be especially tough or even the kind of game a guide is necessary for.  But every now and then you do find yourself picking up a guide for one reason or another.  It's the kind of a game where the guide makes a nice compliment.  The game has been out for well over a decade as I write this review, but it doesn't hurt to talk about the guide a little bit.  This may be one of the most clear cut examples of why Bradygames sometimes makes some lazy guides.  Of course, unless you played through MGS2 on higher difficulty settings you probably wouldn't really know.<br /><br />The guide begins quite nicely going through all the basics.  At the time of its release MGS2 offered a ton of features that made it a whole other beast from its predecessor.  I was glad to see that the guide had taken a LOT of time to discuss them.  By now this stuff is second nature to anyone who has played the game, but it's nice to see that they went to so much depth to provide players with a good sense of what to expect.  The only thing that was annoying to read about were the difficulty settings where they point out the basic, &#34;Enemies hit harder,&#34; type stuff but without providing any depth beyond that.<br /><br />The walkthrough has some details that make it pretty darn good.  There are some hints called out every now and then, but the walkthrough is also pretty straightforward.  The guards, and their routes, are called out on the maps.  Likewise, there are strategies for each individual guard as well as each of their dog tags if you're going for them.  The walkthrough has some good detail going for it too.  It's long winded, but at least it has the appearance of being organized.  It calls out each character as they're introduced as well.  There are also some good boss strategies as well.  The maps show you where items are located and call out other things such as bombs if they'e there.<br /><br />The secrets section and easter egg section is somewhat nice, but also quite limited.  The guide calls out many little tidbits you can do and a few secrets but it definitely doesn't call out ALL of them.  For instance, it mentions Raiden's Wigs but doesn't mention all of them or even how to get them all.  There's something about the secrets section of the guide that feels unfinished in a way.<br /><br />The biggest problem with Bradygames Metal Gear Solid 2 guide is that it is designed for those playing through Normal Mode only.  If you plan on playing through Hard or Extreme you'll find that this guide won't help you in any way, shape or form.  Unlike most games out there, Metal Gear Solid 2 has VERY noticeable differences from one difficulty setting to the next.  The first game had slight differences in difficulty but aside from taking away your radar, few of them were big enough to warrant having to note them in the walkthrough of a guide.  The second game is not like this.  Higher difficulty settings have more guards.  They see beyond their field of vision.  But it's more than just that.  The bombl mission early on in Raiden's campaign?  There are MORE bombs that the guide doesn't point out.  How about the bombs on the connecting bridges before the harrier?  Again, there are more.  These are differences that are worth noting that the guide never talks about or brings up.<br /><br />It's even worse when you consider how different some of the fights can be as well.  The battle with Fortune is pretty straightforward and almost doesn't need a strategy... unless you're playing on Extreme.  Then the battle is quite a bit different.  The same for Fatman and Vamp.  The battles require a VERY different strategy from the Normal difficulty setting because the battles are so radically different.  In no way does this guide prepare players for greater challenges.  They neglect to mention any new guards that appear on higher difficulty settings, or how certain aspects of the campaign change.  They neglect to inform you how bossbattles are different.  The guide simply assumes that what works on the Normal difficulty setting with certainly suffice on Hard and Extreme.<br /><br />If you plan on going through Metal Gear Solid 2 on Normal without ever going to the higher difficulty settings then this guide is going to be a useful tool.  This is the big problem with Bradygames and it probably began here.  The guide will help you learn the game, it won't help you master the game.  You'll learn all the basics of Metal Gear Solid 2 but you'll never learn how to be GREAT at Metal Gear Solid 2.battles are different.

This is by no means a perfect guide! The only thing that makes this guide really good is its level of detail, basic training section, and complete coverage of Dante Must Die! mode.<br />To start off, the basic training section tells you how to work with this game and really does explain much about how to use Dante and his moves.  They tell you how much Alastar and Ifrit moves cost.  They even threw in a joke or two (but they weren't funny).<br />The walkthrough is where this guide starts to fall off though!  Now I admit the walkthrough was very good, but its lay-out was a little awkward.  The maps were nearly unusable.  They didn't tell you where items were.  They also had numbers on the map but then you had to scan the text below to know exactly what they were talking about to figure anything out.  I thought the walkthrough was gonna be like this.  A number displayed on the map right, and then they would tell you what to do in the text under that number, easy right? Well it felt like reading a different guide when I found that the walkthrough was a little off on some details.  Also, they didn't have maps for all the areas, and they mostly seemed content with Joking around in this guide.  While it DOES get you through the game there were problems along the way.<br />The secrets section explained all the secrets to the game.  But when it told me about the hard mode, it neglected to mention that it cost more red orbs to buy items such as a Vital Star.  It did help you find all the blue orb fragments but you needed to look in the section dedicated to helping you find all the blue orb fragments where as the walkthrough left you confused.  The guide seem to have more screenshots than it does of words of wisdom.<br />However, the guide really helped me with the Dante Must Die! mode and you can use that section to find out the differences in the Hard Mode too.<br />Overall, this was a fairly good guide but its a twist of turn for VERSUS BOOKS as this guide was not as good as their other guides in the past.  However, if you're content on getting through the game and not concerned much about the blue orb fragments then pick this up.e too.<br />Overall, this was a fairly good guide but its a twist of turn for VERSUS BOOKS as this guide was not as good as their other guides in the past.

They've been out for so long that info is generally more ripe within these games.  Various wiki's, online walkthroughs etc.  With that in mind, the lazy effort put forth by Bradygames with their Final Fantasy Chronicles guide is somewhat bewildering.  The organization is shoddy.  And while most info is there (I say most because it's rather incomplete in some regards) you don't get the sense it's a fully realized guide.<br /><br />Let's start with Final Fantasy IV, first.  Normally when I do a review for a guide I like to tell you about each section as a whole, but I won't really do this with this particular guide.  It does start with the introduction that reminds you Final Fantasy IV is one of the hardest RPGs out there and quickly glosses through the basics.  But it's really the walkthrough where the guide has problems for both games.  Final Fantasy IV suffering more so.  Yes, as usual, they've divided things up into chapters with a list of objectives.  They divide the walkthrough by area, often listing the enemies found in the area or in the dungeon itself.  But again, it only list most.  Not all.  There are boss strategy call outs that aren't so bad and it has suggested levels for each dungeon but you never really get the sense that there's anything necessary about what the guide is really telling you.<br /><br />When it comes to an RPG guide there are a few things that I believe are rather important.  The first, and perhaps most important of all, is to include maps.  Area maps and world maps.  While the guide has the world maps there are very few actual area maps.  And when they do include maps it's a rather lazy effort.  They might show where they lead but they will NOT point out items.  And it's rather annoying.  Granted, many areas in Final Fantasy IV are quite straightforward but the walkthrough isn't organized enough that it tells me where to find items or anything of the sort.  It's not that the guide can't help one get through the game--it's that it isn't a definitive resource about the game itself.<br /><br />The Chrono Trigger section is very similar.  Though it's walkthrough is divided by the actual chapters of the game with call outs to the areas it's actually somewhat annoying just the same.  In part because it has similar issues.  There is an unusual lack of maps.  And when there are maps there is a severe lack of item callouts on it.  Unlike Final Fantasy IV, however, all the enemies are listed... but it's quite clear this is only because the game itself actually has the entire bestiary loaded onto the disc and you can unlock it.  The info is ripped straight from there.  They also list all the items in an area instead of just some, but again, mainly because you can unlock \\"treasure maps,\\" in the bonus content of the game itself.<br /><br />That's not to say it's all bad.  It will help you obtain all the endings and actually does have some decent strategies (particularly the boss strategies).<br /><br />The disappointment with the guide isn't that it lacks a ton of information, but rather that it feels rushed in getting it out there.  The lack of detail in the maps when they're there and sometimes excluding them entirely just seems strange.  The lack of a comprehensive bestiary for both games (and instead just providing an enemies list before each dungeon) seems strange, but can be forgiven.  It just seems strange that Bradygames put so much more effort into the Final Fantasy Origins guide and (to some extent) the Final Fantasy Anthology guide but couldn't be bothered to really do as much here.  You WILL get through both games using this guide, you just might not gleam all the info ABOUT these games using the guide.ems or anything of the sort.

Eventhough this was a good read (not as good as Along Came a spider of Jack and Jill) but you will most likely be dissapointed with the ending.  In fact it was good until the ending came along.<br />I love the Alex Cross novels.  But in this one, he faces the most brillant and Complex killer ever.  A mysterious criminal who calls himself the mastermind.  The Mastermind goes around hiring people to rob banks for him.  ONLY killers.  After reading the first 22 chapters, I began to gain more interests.<br />However, I did miss the the Two Killer in one book thing.  This book didn't keep me on the edge of my seat the way Along came a spider did.<br />The book was good until the ending, which I was very dissapointed at who the mastermind was.  It didn't exactly mix with me.<br />Alex Cross wasn't the same guy either.  I began to notice that he could figure out almost anything.  He was still a great detective, and this was a great thriller.  What made this to be disappointing was how much the characters changed for me.  After reading &quot;Along Came a Spider&quot;, &quot;Jack and Jill&quot;, and &quot;Pop Goes the Weasel&quot;,I reread this book. I began to notice that the characters were different.<br />The Mastermind was no Gary Soneji, and near the end it just got &quot;weird&quot; and by that I mean.  They caught one guy who they thought was the mastermind, and he said &quot;You've got the wrong guy,&quot; and then they catch another one, and another one.<br />Though YOU may find out who the mastermind is, Alex doesn't discover this.  I guess we'll have to wait until November 2001, for &quot;Violets Are Blue,&quot; (yes that is the next Alex Cross novel) to come out.  Maybe then the Mastermind will be caught.<br />Also, you're left with a cliff hanger ending, but I am a little used to that now.<br />Next is that Patterson is very detailed in the book, and does know how to keep me reading, (especially the Alex Cross books)<br />But with how much the characters changed, I can say that Alex Cross fans would be just a little disapointed with this one, as well as the ending.reading, (especially the Alex Cross books)<br />But with how much the characters changed, I can say that Alex Cross fans would be just a little disapointed with this one, as well as the ending.	2001-05-10

For those who just love the Alex Cross Novels, and can't be without, I'm warning you now, this one doesn't feature Cross, and isn't worth your time.<br />First of all, this is a pretty dumb plot.  Shocking ending, but I still can't believe I read this entire book.  It was only 325 pages (Hardcover) and so I figured since I started it, I'd better finish.<br />But all and all, I was very displeased.  This is based on an earlier book Virgin, but I bet Virgin was better.<br />I was really disappointed with this one.  The only thing it has is really good detail.  The characters aren't well built.  For example, Kathleen likes Anne Fitzgerald, and never gets a problem with her in the book.  But Kathleen dislikes everybody else.<br />What was worse was that &quot;shocking&quot; ending.  Not exactly the best of Patterson.  This isn't a book you'd want to read, unless you're really bored.  At first it is a very confusing book.  This may hold our darkest fears, but they're put into a very uninteresting story.<br />If you are a fan of Alex Cross, then I wouldn't recomend this one.  I also would say that this isn't a good first James Patterson read.	2001-05-10

This was a really great RPG guide (it was a little more helpful then the FFVII guide, and actually told you ALL the secrets).<br />Where should I start?<br />Ok, the walkthrough is well, different then from what we've seen in other guides.  First of all, the maps are in the back of the book (I know I know, I don't want to flip all those pages) but the maps you most likely won't need. The boss strategies are really helpful, but I still say that you should go by your own.<br />Now the walkthrough, gives you the objections in numerals first.  Then the complicated ones, it'll explain.  At first reading this guide is confusing.  But it leads it further away from spoiling the plot.<br />However.. it probably would've helped if the maps were in the walkthrough, but being that you go off screen every ten seconds in the game, I guess I didn't mind.<br />Next is that, You shouldn't mind the stats for the Ultima Weapon being wrong, or the oilboyles.  Its corrected in the bestiary.  Again, I know we don't want to spend time flipping back to the bestiary, but the truth is... You don't want to use the bestiary for HP listings, or stats, (being that the enemies level up with you) so you should only use it to find out what enemies drop and what you can steal from them. Other then that, the bestiary is a lot better done than in the FFVII guide.<br />The problems with this guide, is that it doesn't tell you how to Boost GF's.  (If you'd like to know you hold select and see a hand on the SQUARE button.  Keep pressing and when the X appears over the hand, don't press.) It also needs a final boss strategy.  It will tell you to use the Omega Weapon boss strategy.  But if you go to thier website, it gives you a completely different strategy.  Needless to say that this could be a problem.  It also doesn't tell you the final boss' stats, but still that wouldn't be too much of a problem.  The walkthrough is too quick for me.  They cover the basics, but don't tell you everything that you can do.<br />The SIDE QUESTS section will help you do them all.  But sometimes I wish the maps were in the walkthrough.  The directions (like when you want to catch Lunatic Pandora) are just too confusing.<br />Overall this guide was great in a ton of areas.  But I would recomend that you LOOK at this guide before getting it.  It will help you get through the game, but it takes away most of the fun from the game.u can do.  <br />The SIDE QUESTS section will help you do them all.

You are one to talk, I know it!  Next is as another reviewer said the guide is supposed to HELP you get through the game.  In other words you use the guide as you go through the game not before hand.  Thats why you people complain about it spoiling the plot and so you must have read the whole walkthrough first.  How you use the guide is you DON'T read the walkthrough first.  See first I was wrong, ok it spoils the ending for SOME of you.  If you used while you were going through the game without reading the walkthrough first then the ending will not be spoiled.  That goes for the plot as well.  Next about spoiling the plot, I think in some guides its a good thing, call me crazy if you wish but thats what you think of me.  If a guide spoils the plot, it can be a good thing because, say you come across the plot in the game and you don't understand it.  Well, if you have a guide use it!  In other words the point of guides is to use them when you need help or get stuck!  NOT to use at every moment you get, you only use them for help.  Maps, well I can understand that for when you get lost so I won't say anything there.  Other then that I'm tired of hearing all the complaints about the plot being spoiled or the ending being spoiled so as far as I can see you can all do what you like and keep using that guide the way it isn't supposed to be used or you can use the way its supposed to be used and only use it for help, but some of you are just too obsessed with VERSUS BOOKS	2000-11-03
US	48278407	RYNJ62D8D663L	1566869862	225773264	Legend of Mana Official Strategy Guide (Video Game Books)	Books	4	5	6	N	N	This is helpful but can be confusing	BradyGAMES has made several guides to Square-Enix (when this guide came out they were Squaresoft) games.  Legend of Mana is not exactly one of the better guides, however.  Despite my four star review (this is an edit, and Amazon doesn't let you change the number of stars you give a product should your opinions change over time), this guide is, in reality, a three star deal.<br /><br />The main reason it's a three star guide?  Simple: This guide is not complete.  There's a ton of information that's missing here, and there's some that's just incorrect all around.  The walkthrough is the biggest setback to this guide aside from all the secret goodies its missing.  Certainly the walkthrough gets you through the game, but there are a lot of drawbacks in it.  For starters, the maps are not in the walkthrough but rather they're in the back.  The walkthrough tries to give directions on where to go in certain dungeons, but they're all around confusing.  The second thing that the walkthrough misses is that it just isn't well organized.  Legend of Mana is a very non-linear game.  If you don't follow the guides route through the game you'll be page flipping forever.  This could've easily been countered by listing all the quest in an index or table of contents and a reference to a page number.  The maps being in the back of the guide doesn't help either.<br /><br />The biggest knock against the guide may very well be the secrets and explanation of all the extra stuff like making weapons and armor.  They don't tell you HOW to make weapons and armor, or even what'll net you some of the best stuff.  Much of what's listed in the tables is also just all around inaccurate and wrong.  Lastly, they don't mention too many secrets here, and after reading FAQs, you'll see that Legend of Mana has a lot more to it.<br /><br />The maps in the back aren't all that detailed either.  Simple everyday screenshots.  They point out items but not all of them, and some areas are so big that the maps are a bit confusing in their layout.<br /><br />On the whole, if you need a route through Legend of Mana, this guide helps.  However, it's a disorganized mess, and there's a ton of information you're just not getting.in their layout.      On the whole, if you need a route through Legend of Mana, this guide helps.
