US	53080018	R22KAP2ZCE6GQF	0972018808	419173443	Coosa	Books	5	3	3	N	N	A book to be shared	Coosa is a sweet, family story based on the family history of Jack Prather. It is an excellent timeline of the Alabama Native American history in Coosa County from 1775. Each generation has adventures mixed with family love. There is Native American mysticism, the tender humor of first love, youngsters antics, and the responsibilities adults accept to protect their family.<br /><br />For Alabama history, Coosa explores the relationship of tribes and the laws of the community. In the early 1800's as Native Americans are forced to move to land across the Mississippi River, this family is allowed to remain due to a law protecting those who held office in community service. The family faces the pre-Civil War tensions, the depression of reconstruction, and the change from rural to urban life. Jack Prather adds his anecdotes of growing up, military service, and family.<br />The story of Black Cloud stands out as he proves to be a forward thinker. Together with the Henry Pounds family, the first white settlers in Coosa County, Black Cloud builds a large cotton plantation, paying the freed black workers years before the Civil War. Black Cloud traveled the region promoting anti-slavery and ran for the US Congress, till a vision foretold the divided Nation and outcome.<br />The novel works well for middle grade readers, but I would like to see it used for parent/child or grandparent/child readings, as a way to open discussion about their own family history.	2004-04-22

The two key female characters do what they have to do to be happy and feel fullfilled.  The men are ways to means in the novel, and appear to lose their strength from early in the novel as the women grow. It is romance in the modern world.  The novel is pure enjoyment as Cherry uses her lyrical voice and humor to move the plot in a very unusual situation.	2003-07-14

Her debut novel WATER FROM THE WELL paints a mural of time and place, spanning almost a hundred years in southwest Arkansas.  Like the red night that opens the first story, the book is filled with images that color symbolizes - passion, violence and blood.<br />McLarey chose the novel's title from an old spiritual in which Jesus gave a woman living water and not water from the well.  But like the woman receiving living water, McLarey's novel will send the reader away singing.	2000-10-05
