(The artificer, for example, may well find a way into 3.5 canon due to its fun factor and quality.)  But the big question for any DM is:  Is this the setting for you?<br />That depends.<br />Eberron is the pinnacle of what I call the &quot;anime movement&quot; in WotC-era D&amp;D.  If you like exotic PC races, overpowered PCs, crunchy tactical powergaming, anachronistic touches, pulp action (in which PCs beat the odds with cinematic flourishes), and high magic, you'll love this setting.  It was built for you.  It has elements of steampunk, noir, and what I call &quot;John Carterism&quot; that you'll find very fun.<br />If, on the other hand, you prefer traditional races (for a Greyhawk or Tolkien-inspired feel), balanced PCs who fear death, storytelling on an equal level with combat feats, a medieval-level setting, gritty action, and low magic, this is not for you.  To you I would recommend MERP, Greyhawk, the upcoming C&amp;C, and perhaps Warhammer Fantasy Role Play.<br />Each reader will have their own preconceived bias.  I, for one, love Dinotopia, China Mieville, Castle Falkenstein, Earthdawn, and all the rest, but prefer my D&amp;D to be about solemn magi and knights in shining armor.  If you want traditionalist fare, run far, far away.  But if you want your D&amp;D spiced with that pulp/anime style that seems to fuse M:TG to the D&amp;D chassis, this is the finest setting out there.	2004-06-23
US	51388692	R3V17YT15UOAP	0786915528	342936691	Monster Manual: Core Rulebook III (Dungeons & Dragons)	Books	5	28	32	N	N	And now, the core trilogy is complete!	Welcome to the outstanding 3rd Edition of the Monster Manual!  Considering that all the way back in 1977, the MM was the first hardcover book ever printed for any RPG, being able to shine in that colossal shadow is an impressive thing.  So what is it, exactly, that makes this tome a worthy predecessor to Gary Gygax's first groundbreaking book?<br />By far the most beautiful and distracting them about this edition is that the entire thing is in full color.  Virtually every page is graced with a glorious new illustration, which shows the classic monsters of the game in all their glory.  A few have been drastically re-worked (such as the Displacer Beast, Stirge, Chimera, Troll, and Bulette), and may not be to everyone's taste.  The tone of the artwork is very similar to that found in the 3rd Edition DMG and PHB, and, if you play Magic:  The Gathering, will be undoubtedly familiar.  Some people will probably be overly distracted by the hyper-stylized, dramatic new renditions; those who have played for decades will likely miss the abstract detail of David Trampier, or the idealized heroic glory of Larry Elmore.  (But Elmore does provide a gorgeous illustration of the Nymph.)  Most newer players, however, will be overjoyed.  Finally, you'll have incomparable artwork that you'll be proud to show to your players in the midst of an encounter!  The one caveat I personally have with the art is that many of the creatures are displayed in \\"composites\\" - for example, the Djinn and Efreeti are shown together, as are three of the Giants.  This looks fabulous, but reveals a bit too much if you want to use the artwork as descriptive color.  The best thing about the art?  Each dragon has its own unique, distinctive look, and they all virtually seethe with ancient gracility and power.  Nicely, nicely done.<br />After you've digested all the eye candy (which could take a couple hours), you can analyze the book for its depth and quality.  The book at first seems woefully short (224 pages), but they manage to cram over 500 monsters into the work, due to the total absence of the \\"1 page, 1 monster\\" mentality.  This leaves some entries unnecessarily brief, but most have just the right level of detail, complete with brief notes on culture and behavior.  In only a few cases (Shadow Mastiff, Wraith, etc.) did I feel I was looking at a heartless, empty pile of stats.<br />Unlike previous edtions, the preliminary text to this book is absolutely essential.  For the first time, monster abilities are compiled, quantified, and all displayed in the same place.  Besides a nice, detailed summary of special attacks and defenses, this portion features rules for monster advancement.  This allows you to create horrifically powerful NPCs (Orcish Warlords, etc.), or even turn monsters into PCs!  Dangerous stuff in the hands of the unwise, but very interesting and useful nonetheless.  Having varied monster power levels adds danger and excitement to the game for jaded players.<br />Each monster description features the usual stats (Armor Class, Hit Dice, etc.), with a few noteworthy additions.  Initiative is specifically given a numeric stat for each monster; Attack types are further formulated (\\"2 claws, 1 bite\\" as opposed to \\"#AT 3\\"); Facing and reach are given exact dimensions, if you prefer to use miniatures; Saving Throws are individualized per species; Attributes (yes, even Charisma!) are listed for ALL monster types; and even Skills and Feats are listed!  The added detail seems cumbersome at first, but after 2 game sessions, I can easily say that the added detail, color, clarity, and excitement are easily worth the hour-long adjustment period.  (Although 1st Edition AD&amp;D veterans may well die of shock when they realize how different all the monsters \\"feel\\" with the added detail.)<br />It worries me that many classic favorites are missing from this book; but of course, that just means that WotC/TSR will be continuing in their tradition of Monstrous Compendium releases.  One look at the proud entries DEMON and DEVIL, and all was forgiven.  ;)~<br />At the back are some very useful Appendices - A complete chapter on mundane animals, details on monstrous vermin (giant spiders, etc.), and most interestingly of all, monster templates!  With these customization options, the DM can create Ghosts of any species, Half-Dragons, Celestials, Fiends, Liches, innumerable Lycanthrope and Vampire variants, and more.  Purists may well be horrified, but I, as an old grognard DM, am 100% for surprising the players.<br />This edition of the Monster Manual accomplishes many things - it formalizes monster entries with a unified, logical approach to attacks, powers and defenses; it re-envisions the entire multiverse of creatures with a coherent, dramatic look; it allows monsters to be played as PCs, or designed as NPCs of any power level; it encourages creativity in unique/surprise monster design; it elaborates all encounters with thoughtful details on skills and abilities; and it leaves novice DMs with very few tactical questions.  The book could have been more detailed on monster lairs, culture, behavior, etc., and I would have dearly loved to see extensive wandering monster tables (I loved the Fiend Folio and MMII), but overall, I was tremendously impressed.  It is true that WotC have gone against the grain to some degree, but virtually every change they made has been for the better.  With every monster improved, re-thought, re-balanced, and given the flexible potential to grow in power along with experienced adventurers, we have here an indispensible work that will keep the players challenged, entertained, fascinated, and terrified for years.  And, conventional tradition aside, isn't that what Dungeons &amp; Dragons is all about?	2000-12-01
US	51388692	R1R6T1AZEGA0ML	0786916397	706069708	Dungeon Master's Screen (Dungeons & Dragons)	Books	4	51	52	N	N	Very well designed - not essential, but nice	Ah, the DM's screen... many people see them as a waste of time, because all of the information is printed in the rulebooks.  Why bother with more of same-old, when you can just look it up?<br />Most of the more experienced DMs out there, however, know that a good DM screen is invaluable.  Not only can you hide your maps and adventure notes from the player, you can also run the game more smoothly.  Instead of spending time flipping frantically through pages, you can instead tell a story!  It's that kind of detail that separates a good, efficient DM from a great one.<br />So, the question is, is this screen up to the task?  Actually, yes.  It's quite large, being 4 full panels wide, and allowing you plenty of space.  With a little manipulation, you can probably even set up a computer to one side without distracting the players.<br />And the tables themselves?  Extensive, but not over-worked.  The most-used portions of this screen will likely be Combat, Attack Mods, etc.<br />A few of the more esoteric entries include resolution of skills (Breaking, Climbing, Escaping, Listening, Searching, etc.).  Although these are highly situational, it's easy to see how these events could come up unexpectedly, as players make their own decisions and try devious routes of play.  I think the table choices here are intuitive, and excellent.<br />The booklet that comes with a DM screen is usually a mini-adventure.  This time around, it's a nice layout featuring combat sheets, encounter generation, and graph paper for map grids.  Very dry, but probably much more valuable in the long run than a one-shot scenario.<br />The artwork on the screen is actually important as well... it's something your players will be staring at for hours on end, so I would say the art is very good, but not detailed enough to inspire endless player inspection.  (One piece of advice I can give, however - if you have pictures of monsters, locations, etc., just prop them against the outside of your screen while the encounter continues.  This does wonders. ;)<br />If all you're after is something to hide your notes, lore, die rolls, and devious machinations from your players, you don't need this.  (Personally, I prefer the artwork on the 1980 DM's screen, whose tables are of course woefully inadequate.)  But if you wand a tool that will put all of the most-needed information at your fingertips, helping you run the game with ease, while you focus on things that are more engaging (like roleplaying and storytelling), you need this!	2000-10-22
US	51388692	R3UH7AD0TMD7TR	0786917423	7282056	Gazetteer (Dungeons & Dragons)	Books	3	64	65	N	N	Inferior to what has gone before	As an avid devotee of the Greyhawk campaign setting since 1980, I wanted to love this.  At last, a panoramic overview of our favorite fantasy world, for the first time since 1983!  Regrettably, most of my enthusiasm evaporated once I cracked the cover.<br />The map on the cover of this booklet is deceptively alluring - lush colors, painted seas with names in delicate script, colored and definitive borders; the inside map is horridly drab.  If you don't know what you're missing, it is perfectly serviceable and adequate; but if you've collected the 1980 or 1983 edition of the World of Greyhawk (which I strongly recommend), you'll be sharply disappointed.<br />Remember the colossal maps of days gone by?  This one is a measly 17&quot;x22&quot;, about 25% of the size of the original.  The &quot;colors&quot; are uniformly brown and gray.  The gorgeous (and useful!) colors of the old maps, noting such things as ocean depth, are totally absent.  Worst of all, there are some features missing!  What's gone?  Spindrift Isles are re-designated Lendore Isles of L module fame (not entirely accurate), Hepmonaland isn't named (OOOPS!), Ahlissa is not named South Province, Idee, Almor, Fax, Badwall, Elredd, and the Forgotten City and ALL of the ruins in the Sea of Dust!<br />Did I like anything about the map?  Yes.  It's very easy to read, there's an enticing map of the western hemisphere of Oerth beyond the Flanaess, and cities are well-marked for calculating distance.  Best of all, a few &quot;secret&quot; names (like Bonewood and Dunhead Bay) are revealed that weren't before.<br />The 32-page booklet is woefully inadequate if you own the boxed set from 1983; but, it does provide excellent historical overviews, clear and concise descriptions of the major kingdoms and features, and a very clean generalization of the world and its epics.  This makes this product an excellent primer for people new to Greyhawk, or people totally new to D&amp;D in general, which is probably the Wizards' intention.<br />And now, the good news... a LIVING GREYHAWK Gazetteer is coming, a 192-page work that should fix ALL of my gripes!  Rejoice, but it makes me wonder how useful this book is going to be in a few months.  :)	2000-09-26
US	51388692	R895MILETMEC2	078691551X	812062848	Dungeon Master's Guide: Core Rulebook II (Dungeons & Dragons)	Books	5	30	31	N	N	A drastic change, but a change for the better	First, to all, a word of warning - this will not appeal to everyone!  The 3rd Edition of Dungeons &amp; Dragons is now fully revealed in all its  glory, and it is two things - [1] a state-of-the-art customizable RPG, with  extensive easy-to-use rules displaying impressive internal logic and  coherence; and, [2] an EXTREMELY fun tribute to classic dungeon  crawls.<br />The 2nd Edition of AD&amp;D was all about diversity - new  nations, new cultures, new horizons, new everything, in a bewildering  array, from Dark Sun to Ravenloft.  3rd Edition, in contrast, retains a  firm focus on the World of Greyhawk, a land with a much more thematically  \\"pure\\" medieval setting.  So if you loved 2nd Edition for its variety, you  may find yourself looking through this book and wondering, \\"Where's my  beloved sprawl of options?\\"<br />The answer is beyond the scope of this book -  all of the options you could ever want are indeed here, as far as game  mechanics are concerned; but if you were hoping for extensive details on  cultures, ultra-customized PCs, and the mysteries of Oerth, you'll have to  wait for future releases (and they are coming, believe me ;).<br />So now that  we know that the book focuses strictly on rules, advice, and play guidance,  we can judge it on its intended merits!<br />First of all, the play advice and  rules on how to create adventures, campaigns, and worlds may seem trite to  veteran DMs, in a very \\"been there, done that\\" déjà vu sort of way; but I  strongly recommend reading these chapters carefully!  There's so many  pieces of good advice and clever time-savers here that even those who have  played for decades (like me) can learn something of lasting value with just  a single reading.  Now that's quality game design!  (As an aside, I  thoroughly enjoyed the fact that the \\"example of play\\" is straight out of  Gygax's original inspired 1979 piece in the 1st DMG - woe to all amateur  players who fall into the clutches of such a sinister DM!)<br />But it's not  all just for the DM - players are given even more options here as well!   Why, you ask, was this information not included in the Player's Handbook?   Well, all of these choices are powerful enough that they've been placed  here for the approval (or disapproval) of each individual DM.  It's a  commendable design choice.  Now, we have Prestige Classes:  Stellar  optional classes such as the Assassin (back at last!), the Witch (an  eternal favorite, since the early days of The Dragon) and the Blackguard (a  paladin fallen from grace, which may remind you of the Anti-Paladin of  old); if they prove too powerful, the DM can always modify or prohibit  them.  If you (like me) are interested in creating truly customized  character classes, you'll have to wait for the Hero Builder's Guide; but,  there are rules for alternate races here that will keep you busy!  (I've  lately been re-integrating Half-Ogres, and thinking about how to balance  the Drow.  Time for old faves!)<br />But that's not all.  The variety isn't  just for PCs!  The NPC generation system proves invaluable - now, you can  whip up a hundred different, engaging, dramatic, and unique individuals in  a single night, and have fun doing so.  With this excellent guidework, it's  actually a meditative pleasure to sit and contrive interesting people for  your players to interact with in some later game session.  That's a  definite plus.<br />As far as player experience goes, however, some people  will hate the open-ended nature of Challenge Ratings; personally, I love  them.  They're very easy to use; you can even include fair rewards for  solving puzzles, role-playing, fulfilling quests, and evading traps and  ambushes.  If you prefer \\"The Old Way\\" of just rewarding hack-n-slash, more  power to you; but for those of us who want to see more role-playing and  player cleverness, these rules are wondrous.  The one thing I'm worried  about is excessive rewards leading to player boredom; personally, I'm  strongly considering cutting all PC XP awards by 50%, all the  time.<br />Another age-old problem, however, has finally been solved.  One of  the drastic omissions in the AD&amp;D system of days gone by (Magister  notwithstanding) has finally and decisively been integrated into the DMG -  there are detailed rules on the creation of magic items!  And they make  sense!  I was astounded, and immeasurably pleased.  Rest assured, your  players will enthusiastically find ways to twist these rules for their own  amusement, but with this work in hand, you'll always be one step ahead of  them.  This section alone adds a huge amount of play value.  (There's also  a fully classified organization of *existing* magic items, which will save  you a lot of hair-tearing in the middle of a game.)<br />Speaking of drastic  omissions, there are no rules here dealing with bravery, morale, monster  retreats, moments of truth, and other such points of valor; if you're used  to rolling dice to decide the fate of monsters and NPCs while the blades  and spells flash... you're out of luck.  Granted, you can come up with a  role-playing solution to this conundrum every time, but \\"old school\\" DMs  will no doubt be rather angered by this.<br />And my favorite part of the  book?  Well, besides the artwork (I love the new style), there's an  invaluable section on monster abilities, unified and categorized.  This  makes the running of monster encounters so much easier that I can't imagine  how I survived without it.<br />So... (sorry for the long read!)  My final  verdict?  A masterpiece?  Actually, yes.  But not to everyone's taste.  If  you're a new player, you'll love it; if you're a veteran, you'll find  yourself disagreeing with many of the design choices, because it's not \\"1st  Edition\\" or \\"2nd Edition\\" or anything in between.  For me, though, that's  the beauty of it... this book is so cleanly designed that if you feel  something's been left out that you simply can't live without, you can  convertthe old rules to synth perfectly into the new, and then you'll have  the best of both worlds.  Viva le difference!  It's a new age, a new world...  and this is your guide.  Enjoy it.	2000-09-20
US	51388692	R1LIUAF2BIUTB4	0786916427	720656250	Character Sheets (Dungeons & Dragons Accessory)	Books	4	46	48	N	N	Excellent, but over-priced	The first thing you'll likely experience when you buy these sheets is sublime pleasure - the design is gorgeous, each class has its own  customized sheet, and the pages are very well-designed, making it very easy  for you to find the information you need quickly during play.  The next  thing you'll feel (about 5 minutes later) is profound disappointment.   Considering the tremendous bargain Wizards of the Coast gave us in the  Player's Handbook, why did they feel the need to rob us blind ($9.95? )  for a tiny ream of paper?  With the *extremely* limited number of sheets,  you will find yourself making frequent and immediate trips to your nearest  scanner or photocopier (with WotC's blessing, of course).  Considering the  ease with which the sheets are printed, however, they could have easily  given us 3 times as many sheets for the price.<br />Overall, however, I am  extremely pleased with the new layout.  The design flows logically, and  allows you to quickly create a character; the sheets are made of a  high-quality paper that erases easily (but woe unto you who must use  photocopies!).  With their comprehensive details, logical format, and  impressive completeness, they actually remind me of the well-regarded  Permanent Character Record Folder of days gone by (TSR, 1980-81).<br />My  final verdict is a mixed one.  If money is not an object, you will be  thrilled with these high-quality records; they will save you time and  quickly make themselves indispensable.  But if you were expecting a bargain  (logically, since the PHB is one, hands down), you may well want to hook up  your printer and use the PHB CD-ROM character generator instead.	2000-09-03
US	51388692	R2RMEMEPOQ8PYH	0786915501	633963573	Dungeons & Dragons Player's Handbook: Core Rulebook 1	Books	5	31	32	N	N	Fantasy RPGs take a quantum leap forward	Well met!  Gary Gygax's magnum opus, Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons, is somewhat akin to holy writ in the world of fantasy RPGs.  And needless to  say, the Wizards of the Coast were a little squeamish to tinker with the  very best game of all time!  It seems heretical - like trying shave off  Zeus' beard, to see if he looks better without it.  But, they made the  right choice - instead of arbitrarily implementing a drastic system  overhaul that nobody wanted, they implemented a drastic system overhaul  that *everyone* wanted.  By having this system play-tested, co-designed,  torn apart, and rebuilt by hundreds of fanatical players and DMs, and  giving the fans a loud (yet cohesive) voice in the reconstructive process,  WotC have done the impossible - Dungeons &amp; Dragons (farewell,  &quot;Advanced&quot;) is now far superior to any other previous incarnation  of itself.<br />The first thing that strikes you when you crack the cover is  the bold new artwork.  If you've played Magic, or love the convoluted  machinations of Planescape, you will be delighted.  Fans of older, more  conservatively heroic styles (like me) will dearly miss the graceful touch  of Larry Elmore, or even David Trampier.  But the new look is infectious,  and it (a) is evocative enough to get you into the mood for a game, and (b)  actually illustrates key points in the internal logic of the rules.  That's  a huge bonus.<br />The bad news?  Anyone who's played since 1st Edition (or  before) is going to have a stroke.  Ability scores have been stratified and  cleaned (dare we say scoured?); bonuses and penalties are different from  what they were before, Exceptional Strength is gone, Strength now  progresses way beyond 25, Charisma actually matters, etc.  What this all  means is that the game is much more logical now, but your old characters  may not fit comfortably into their new surroundings.  For a game where a  single character's story can often last for years, this can be a serious  concern.The nail in the coffin for your old character is this:  now, PCs  actually gain attribute points (1 every 4 levels) as they progress.  So, if  you have an &quot;old school&quot; level 24 arch-mage, his stats are now 6  points lower than they should be in 3rd Edition!<br />The best aspect of the  new system is its customized universality.  What I mean by that is, you can  make ANY kind of character.  Gnomish Paladin?  Go for it.  Halfling Mage?   No problem.  Elvish Ranger/Druid/Monk?  Hmmm, ask your DM, and come up with  a great backstory, and you're good to go.  It's a bit of a system shock for  old-timers (&quot;Gasp!  A Dwarven Mage?  No...&quot;), but for everyone  else, it becomes obvious even before the first game that every single  character will be a unique creation, and by level 3 or so, the idea of  &quot;cookie cutter characters&quot; entirely disappears.  And with the new  Feat system (which rewards all progressing characters with new abilities  chosen by the player), even single-class Fighters are immediately and  vastly different from one another!<br />A few brief class notes:  Barbarians  are back!  Monks are back!  Cavaliers are still missing in action  (overshadowed by Paladins, as they always were), Acrobats are integrated  into the existing rogue class, Assassins are missing (and lamented), and a  new class, the Sorcerer, makes a wonderfully bright appearance.<br />And  gameplay changes:  Clerics can now turn undead only a few times per day,  making this ability similar to a spell, and far more dramatic; mages can  wear armor (if they don't mind their spells fizzling); proficiencies have  been vaulted into the realm of a complete new skill system (you knew it was  coming!); task management is now understandable and easy (if you take your  1st edition DMG, and look in the index under &quot;Door,&quot; you'll see  why old school Dungeon Masters lose their hair prematurely); Greyhawk is  again the default world for official D&amp;D (rejoice!); counterspells now  exist (a nod to Magic:  The Gathering); and to answer the question...<br />no,  your 2nd Edition character won't fare too well through the conversion  process.<br />This is the one (huge) problem I have with this amazing book.   But when I slept on it, I decided this was actually a blessing.  With all  of the new rules for character design, customization, and growth potential,  why not leave our old heroes in the vaunted halls of history?  I, for one,  am going to go roll up a new Half-Elven Ranger/Mage of Celene tonight,  point my ears in the direction of the Free City of Greyhawk, and rejoice in  the glorious heroic chants a new age.  It's that kind of day.	2000-08-15

Although begun with TSR (with the release of Artifact of Evil and Saga of Old City), when Gygax was unceremoniously removed from the company, he took  his finest creation with him.  This one is interesting because instead of  being a single tale, the book is divided into 9 short stories, each  highlighting a different time and place in Gord's illustrious career.  In  The Heart of Darkness, Gord and Chert plunge into the Ruins of Castle  Greyhawk; in Cats vs. Rats, the Thieves Guild of Greyhawk is thrown into  chaos, with highly amusing results; and in A Revel in Rel Mord, Gord finds  himself preyed upon by a sinister circle of Night Hags.  Each story is a  wonderful slice of Greyhawk lore; lots of details of the monsters,  locations, and personalities of this famous world are revealed at every  turn - lore which you can't find in any other book!  And of course, readers  can delight in the master himself, as we finally get to see how an AD&amp;D  adventure game should *really* be played.  Although a bit disorienting to  anyone not intimately familiar with the saga of Gord the Rogue, Night  Arrant receives my utmost recommendation.  It's that good!	2000-06-19

After 20+ years of ignorant attacks on the game system by Christian extremists, it's nice to be able to say that again.  Don't get me wrong, I love Planescape, but somehow, it just didn't seem to  provide a gothic, forsaken, ultra-dramatic Hell.  Now we have it!  Granted,  it's a bit unorthodox and anti-classical, but I believe that's the point.   This isn't a mere retread of the classic AD&amp;D representation of Hell -  if you want a tamer, more Dantean environment, check out Dragon 75, 76, the  Manual of the Planes, and the 1st printing of the Monster Manuals I and II.   This book has a more creative vision - it tries to remold our  interpretation of the Infernal into something more cosmic, alien, and  underwordly.  You get the impression that Hell isn't necessarily a place  where the damned go for punishment; rather, its raison d'etre is as the  ultimate stronghold of diabolic (lawful) evil.  And it's good!  The Blood  War and history are briefly touched upon, but then we plunge in up to our  necks with fantastic details on devils and their beliefs and society, notes  on infernal cults, the priests-turning-fiends table, and great new kits  that your players will love if they want to dive into &quot;the 9.&quot;   The Devil Slayer is your basic Hell-bent (ahem) crusader, the Thaumaturgist  is a diabolical summoner who specializes in comprehending contracts and  magical circles, the Inquisitor is an horrific cleric subclass, the  Hellblade is a type of ninja-infiltrator who destroys devils, etc.  Then,  we have L'Ordre de la Croix-Rose Veritas, a great devil slaying  &quot;Templar&quot; order in Greyhawk.  But there's more!  Diabolic magic,  the descriptions of the Hells, infernal powers, the arch-devils, and  minions are all described.  All in all, it's an amazingly useful  compendium.  I give it four stars only because its unorthodox nature keeps  it from appealing to everyone.  In Pace Requiscat!	2000-06-17

The Rod of  Seven Parts may be the one exception - until now!  This admirable adventure  (one of the best titles in the nostalgic Dungeon Crawl series) finds the  veteran heroes embroiled in a cruel conflict between the Lords of Law and  Chaos... they must find the Chaos Key to pass into the Lost Shrine and put an  end to the resurrection of these ancient powers.  Although the focus is  strictly upon brutal action and furious pacing, there is a somber  undercurrent of profound clashes just below the surface - sub-themes that a  thoughtful DM could do well to exploit!  Overall, it's a commendable  effort.	2000-06-14

But wouldn't you love to explore such a  place?  Now you can!  This spectacular book makes Evermeet a living,  breathing world - details are given on the land, the cultures (strongly  influenced by Celtic mythology), the wondrous spells and magic items unique  to the isle, the great heroes, possibilities for grandiose adventures  (dragons abound!), and even, far below, the sinister machinations of the  Drow.  If you love elves and high fantasy, you owe it to yourself to read  this book!	2000-06-14

Instead of floundering helplessly with a dozen Monstrous Compendiums, this book gives you over 600 monsters, with  complete details!  And that doesn't just mean combat statistics - diet,  motivation, appearance, culture, and more are all touched upon.  There are  of course limitations to the presentation, but the text is admirable  because it is evocative - the \\"mysteries\\" of each species encourage the DM  to elaborate as much as he or she sees fit.  The one drawback to this book  is the illustrations - the quality of many of them is abominable, which is  a shame, considering the power of the text.

If your characters have progressed to the degree of mastery that allows them to challenge the great powers of the multi-verse (demon lords, elder  dragons, arch-devils, demigods, etc.), why not give them a REAL challenge?  This book details the creation of artifacts (this in itself will launch  your campaign into the world of legends), curses, creating non-artifact  magical items (invaluable!), recharging magic items (finally), artifact  powers, and more.  The rest of the book gives full, elaborate details on a  myriad of wondrous artifacts - their history, sage, powers, destruction,  curses, and stories.  Featured items include Baba Yaga's Hut, Eye and Hand  of Vecna, Johydee's Mask, Mace of St. Cuthbert (beware Iuz!), Orbs of  Dragonkind, Rod of Seven Parts, Sword of Kas, and much more.

The PHBR (Player's Handbook Reference) series is one of the most highly-regarded, and yet much-maligned, series of supplements ever created.  Each sourcebook takes one of the races or classes of the AD&amp;D game,  and adds to it huge amounts of new detail - new equipment, spells, kits  (sub-classes), lore, new rules, etc.  The problem is that the players love  these so much that the DM often feels compelled to buy into the rest of the  series - an expensive proposition!  Fortunately, these works were  \\"reprinted\\" in the excellent AD&amp;D Core Rules CD-ROM.  This one  introduces the powerful and alien class of the Psionicist - if you are not  running a Spelljammer or Dark Sun campaign, you will want to think VERY  carefully before allowing this class to players!  The power and versatility  of these characters is amazing. Details of this book include:  the  Psionicist class and restrictions, a full explanation of psionic powers,  disciplines, and advancement, special abilities, the powerful Wild Talents,  psionic combat (a great system), the great powers (Clairsentience,  Psychokinesis, Psychometabolism, Psychoportation, Telepathy, and  Metapsionics), running a psionics campaign, and great monsters!

The lore includes:  an overview of the region, its power, cultures and  influence, history, political relations, and classic chapters on each Dale  that cover customs, secrets, magic, monsters, adventure hooks, trade, law  and order, temples, ruins, heroes, cities, maps, and more.  Some of the  best chapters include Shadowdale (home of Elminster himself), Tarkhaldale  (the Lost Dale), the realm of Randal Morn, and much more!  One of the best  compendiums of Realmslore ever printed, and very hard to find.	2000-06-09

In a world where the unexpected is the only predictable thing, no one could have foreseen The Horde... from the utter east, an unstoppable legion of dark riders thunders from the lost horizon,  and bitter enemies must band together in a desperate struggle for survival.   A few, scattered heroes dare to delve into the east, seeking a way to stop  the invasion at its source.  Your PCs will adventure across unknown wilds,  into a mystic kingdom that lies far beyond the impassable Katakoro  Mountains.  Winter trolls, wu jen, nagas, vampires, and worse await them.   Will they survive?  Only if the act in perfect unison, and use their  cunning and teamwork to avoid bringing disaster down upon themselves from  every direction!  A great adventure.	2000-06-09

Although perfect for a Kara-Tur campaign, these monsters also work fantastically in a Greyhawk campaign, representing the  infringing monsters on the outlands near the Far East - powerful minions  (and overlords!) for Oriental-themed classic beasts like the Rakshasa, Ogre  Mage, Dragon Turtle and Lung Dragons.  64 pages of pure monsters...  a  wonderful compendium for any DM looking to intrigue jaded veteran players.	2000-05-02

The ultimate Greyhawk dungeon crawl - huger than the Temple of Elemental Evil by far - this epic was printed for only a few months in 1990.  If you didn't get it, it was never reprinted!  This is the COMPLETE adventure throughout the Ruins of Castle Greyhawk itself - for levels 2-15  and beyond!  You get:  over 900 detailed dungeon chambers, complete with  monsters, traps, and treasures, on 26 different dungeon levels (no, I'm not  joking!), 8 pages of monster stats, and 26 full-color maps!  Dare you enter  the tomb of the Arch-Magus Zagig himself?  An unspeakably huge adventure  that will keep your players occupied for years (my group literally spent  hundreds of play hours here!).

It's for one of those nights when no one really feels like concentrating on the dire drama of the campaign, and just wants to crash with good friends and laugh it up for awhile.  The menace of  the Dragon Claw is everywhere!  (Mad Monkey doesn't like this.)  Since  there aren't any real heroes anymore, some old guy needs to train some new  scapeg... um, recruits to deal with the menace.  And now, Young Grasshopper,  the time has come for you to leave this place... a fun, amusing adventure for  levels 6-9.	2000-05-02

US	51388692	R3PLGPC20PZO3S	0786914343	211541001	Return To White Plume Mountain	Books	5	19	26	N	N	Intense puzzle-solving adventure for veteran heroes	On the long, bitter-sweet journey through life, can you ever go back home?  Sadly, no.  But you can plop down and stay at some really cool motels, replete with cable, mints, and mini-fridges, on your wayward jaunt into the unknown.  Such is my mundane, quasi-philosophical revelation after  DM'ing this adventure.  No, it's not quite as profound as the \\"Belarius  maturity conundrum,\\" but hey, it's enough for a few weekends' worth of  glorious casual play.  Which is all we really need sometimes!   Old-timers (*hack, cough*) on the Greyhawk scene will probably be most  enthusiastic about the adventure's detailed \\"world\\" trappings, more so than  with the actual plot.  Remember Erol Otus' cryptic, enchanting pictorial  map of the Mountain's environs, in the original S2?  Now, we actually get  to meet Thingizzard (and find out why her potions are something to be wary  of!), hack our way through the Twisted Thickets, and perhaps even fall into  the beguiling clutches of Dragotha.  But, once the adventurers venture into  the shadows of a cave known to hundreds of thousands as the Wizard's Mouth,  everything changes.  And that's where both the problem and the beauty  lie.  Anyone looking for a mere re-tread of the original spectacle of  Lawrence Shick's magnum opus is bound to be disappointed.  It's a new age.   Now, monsters need food, logical housing, a reason to live, and a reason to  die.  (I guess Belarius wasn't the only one psychologically scarred 20  years ago.)  Dungeons need architecture.  And adventures need a conclusion,  answers to questions, and yes, sadly, a plot.  If you can detach  yourself from the nostalgia of the original, and appreciate this work as an  entirely separate entity, you'll be absolutely thrilled with the sheer  ingenuity of Bruce Cordell's story.  I can virtually guarantee that no  veteran AD&amp;D'er will be able to figure out what's going on until  they're well in over their heads.  Keraptis' ancient experiments, it seems,  have left quitea magical legacy; a new, mutated form of meta-magic, nearly  sentient, has evolved in the dungeons below White Plume Mountain, with  horrifying (and extremely amusing) repercussions.  As the adventurers  enter, several power-mad warlords are fighting desperately to control  Keraptis' dreaded Indoctrination Center, and the notorious weapons of the  first White Plume module are being used as the primary symbols of power and  destruction.  (I'm being intentionally vague here, because if you haven't  read it, get this module!  You're in for a treat.)  A few of the  encounters are misplaced, or over-powered - Mossmutter, a corrupted great  wyrm, may well wipe out all but the most experienced adventurers in an  eyeblink, and Killjoy the efreeti is more of a cardboard cutout than a  true, deep-thinking nemesis.  But these are merely trivial concerns - the  adventure is a joy to run (and experience!), the full-color maps of the  dungeons are gorgeous, and veteran players will get a serious overdose of  nostalgia as they slog through the original level and witness the  cataclysmic changes two decades of chaos and mayhem have wrought.  New  players may be overwhelmed by the colossal challenges and Byzantine  intrigues awaiting them on the Indoctrination Level, but nevertheless, a  great time will be had by all - and hey, if you have to lose a character,  what could be cooler than having his soul schlorped into Blackrazor?  Minor  reservations aside (which are fixable anyway with an hour's worth of  fine-tuning), Return to White Plume Mountain is easily the 2nd-best  adventure of 1999.  (Only Return to the Keep on the Borderlands is better.)	2000-05-02

But, if you look closer, there's much more of value, especially for a  Greyhawk campaign.  First of all, there's full spreads of some of the  finest \\"old school\\" artwork TSR ever produced - some of the illustrations,  such as the Paladin slaying the Black Dragon, have never been surpassed.   Even better, there are exhaustive spell and power lists for some of the  most difficult monsters to create - the Couatl, Ki-Rin, and Lich.  And most  importantly, you get exclusive stats, illustrations and personality  histories for some of the most famous characters from Gygax's Greyhawk  campaign, as they were during play in 1980!  Included are Gary Gygax's  Bigby, Riggby and Mordenkainen, Harold Johnson's Grimslade, Rob Kuntz' Sir  Robilar, Ernie Gygax's Serten and Tenser, Erol Otus' Valerius, and many  more!

The kingdoms of Vestland and the Ethengar Khanate, forever at odds,  are on the verge of war - the holy Sonora Crown has been stolen, and an  heir has not even been named!

Dave Cook and Tom Moldvay forced back the boundaries of the game with this fascinating glimpse into the previously hazy world of wilderness adventuring - and what a classic it is! With a pulp adventure mentality, voodoo witch doctors,  rampaging dinosaurs, a lost city, pirates, lost heroes, exotic monster  cultures never seen before, and an ancient, mysterious curse to unravel, X1  somehow smashed an entire realm of adventure into a single booklet. I  remember the wonderful adventure hooks in the back - in 1981-82, my group  spent over 14 months exploring the Isle and having an unforgettable time.  Even more amazingly in retrospect, the poster map in this book and the few  details were the first glimpse we ever got of the world of Mystara.

Their quest takes them  into one of the most ingenious dungeon settings ever devised - the Mobius  Tower, where time literally stands still - an assassin's arrow hangs  suspended inches from its target's breast, the torchlight glows solid,  unmoving and cold, and only the ghosts still wander free... of course, that's  until the chaos of distance and time distortion magic kicks in!  An  unforgettable classic for levels 7-9, highest recommendation.	2000-05-02

An exceedingly clever adventure that will keep your  players guessing until the very end.	2000-05-02

Once your players finally begin to grow weary of your wondrous world of fantasy, and  they've plunged into the deepest realms of the Drow and the Underdark, why  not give them a shocking revelation - an entire world of wonder magically  sustained at the world's core!  Best of all, due to its alien nature and  absolute forgotten nature, the Hollow World set integrates cleanly in any  campaign - be it Mystara, Forgotten Realms, Greyhawk, or one of your own  devising.  The creators have taken this into full consideration, because  there are complete conversion rules for AD&amp;D as well.  Contents  include:  The giant 128-page DM's book, a 64-page Player's Book dedicated  solely to making fascinating new PCs (or converting veterans), four  colossal world maps, and a 32-page book of epic adventures in a truly  majestic setting - dinosaurs still roam in the twilight, the horizons curve  strangely upwards, and magic known to no one awaits... a wonderful set,  highly recommended.	2000-05-02

Here, they'll find timeless beauty, the ever-elusive  feng-huang (phoenix), the equally secretive chi'lin (unicorn), and a savage  death... unless, of course, you have some of the most resourceful players in  the world, with an ingenious team strategy and a thirst for the impossible.

Seems  pretty simple, in a fun hack-n-slash kind of way.  But once your heroes  (levels 2-8) come to the dread Orcish city of Krimba-Hai, and the fell  secrets that lie within, they'll never trust you again... :)  A vicious,  ingenious twist on every predictable gaming hook ever devised... highly  recommended!	2000-05-02

One of my favorite RPG accessories of all time - the only thing that will save a DM more hair and sanity than this is the DMG or the Book of Lairs.  The ultimate crisis resource - there are no rules here, just over a hundred  pages of outstanding sage advice from veteran TSR DM Paul Jaquays on  roleplaying, descriptions, creating a campaign, running an adventure, and  dealing with problems of every imaginable kind.

Now, your high-level heroes (9-12) get a chance to find out  what new diabolical menace has come to plague the ruins...

It doesn't matter what level your PC is, or what he's  carrying; if you don't have desperate intuition, amazing creativity,  perfect teamwork, and precise skills of perception, the final encounter  will blast your hero into a pile of soulless ash.  It's always said \\"for  levels 10-14,\\" but it really doesn't matter; if you think you're up to the  challenge, it's time to prove yourself in the Tomb of Acererak the  Unforgiven!	2000-05-02

When Randal Morn delved into the  Tomb of Shraevyn, seeking the dreaded Sword of the Dales, everyone feared  that he would become the invincible ruler of Daggerdale.  But, since he  never returned, and the tomb is rumored to be filled with treasures and  dark intrigue, it's perfectly natural that the PCs would want to follow in  his footsteps!  What they'll find, though, will horrify them, and either  make them stronger, or give them good reason to roll those attribute dice  again... ;)	2000-05-02

Here, author Tom Moldvay secured an impressive license - Lovecraft devotee &amp; accomplice Clark Ashton Smith, and his dark, French-inspired faerie shadowland of Averoigne.  The heroes (levels 3-6) are plunged into the Tomb of Stephen Amber, and the dreamworld beyond,  where they will quickly learn that magic is illegal, the nobility are  insane, the PCs themselves are manipulated pawns, and beautiful maidens  with unicorns aren't ever what they seem... a maliciously ingenious  adventure, and highly recommended.	2000-05-02

The ancient port the PCs call home (for now) is slowly sinking into the depths, and an horrific race of monsters is strangling the city by  infesting the harbor.  The heroes (levels 4-10!) must venture into one of  the most intriguing areas of Mystara, the Quagmire... a swampy jungle region  of two enormous lost tropical isles surrounding a shallow sargasso sea.  By  Merle M. Rasmussen, of Top Secret fame.  A classic!	2000-05-02

Appearing briefly in 1987, this masterwork finally revealed the planes of existence... you get complete details on spellcasting and adventure in the Elemental  Planes, the Abyss, the Nine Hells, the Seven Heavens, Hades, and everything  in between!  And this is *not* the Planescape universe... all of this  material is true to the original AD&amp;D vision set out by Gygax, and thus  totally compatible with Greyhawk, the Forgotten Realms, or your own  campaign world.

Here, you'll find a solidly  scripted adventure beginning with an intense wilderness gauntlet, leading  into a subterranean citadel filled with labyrinthine catacombs, sinister  traps, and a very clever method of transportation that should scare the  hell out of your players and provide you with several adventures worth of  amusement.

(So what does a currach look like, exactly, anyway?)  Even  better, from a collector's point of view, is the TSR Product List - a  summary of every single release ever put out by TSR from the very beginning  (1974) to 1992, complete with product codes.

It's by UK adventure guru Jim Bambra; with the dramatic, dark writing and the classically bizarre Euro-fantasy  illustrations, it reminds me strongly of the best of the Fighting Fantasy  books, or even better, Steve Jackson's Sorcery.

He then retreats into the wilds of the Abbor Alz, south of Greyhawk, beyond the Ghost Tower of Inverness.  His  accomplice?  None other than Lord Robilar, the flamboyant villain from  Gygax's campaign mentioned in T1-4.  The veteran PCs (very high level!)  must plunge into the wilds of the Bright Desert, facing desert centaurs,  manscorpions, and far worse as they grimly bring Rary (a level 24  arch-mage) to justice.

WHY? ), old school psionics (for all those Illithids in GDQ1-7), the  original \\"down to the last hit point\\" monster XP value charts, building  NPCs and evocative dungeon settings the \\"Gygax way,\\" player creation of  spells and magic items, and much more; my personal favorite touch is the  endless extolling of the virtues of encouraging the PCs in the early  levels, while only a few pages later, we're treated to  a graphic depiction  of a game in progress that STRONGLY implies it's good to kill the PCs at  1st level, even if they do everything right... :) (see pp. 97-100)  Hehe!

That adventure was amazing!\\"  Well, they did, and they're all as good as N1, but the print runs were so shamefully small that N2 through N5  are some of the most difficult-to-collect introductory adventures in  existence.  In the idyllic meadows of the Downs, the Druids of old have  faded into legend - some say they still protect the farmers from the  deepmost woods, but others believe them to be legends.  But now, a horrible  blight has rotted the land, and an ancient man says that he remembers them  - and someone must journey through the perilous wilds and find them.

I was so excited to see this finally make it into print that I bought 7 copies.  A brand new Greyhawk adventure, based on the modules of  old, but an entirely new experience, with no rehashing!  How long had I  been waiting for this?  The enthusiasm wore off a bit as I plowed  through the module's 128 pages.  I haven't had a chance to play this  adventure yet, but I have a few reservations about the experience.  The  adventure begins well.  The humanoid clans of the Pomarj, scattered into  chaos once again by the heroic depredations of the adventurers of 20 years  ago (A1-4), have once again been reunited by a Slavelord - this time, it is  the grim, charismatic Turrosh, a half-orc princeling who shows ingenious  savagery as both lord and conqueror.  The dreaded yellow sails, not seen on  any armada for years, have once again become the symbol of death and  slavery throughout the Wild Coast, and even as far as the Nyr Dyv.  It's  time for a new generation of heroes to put an end to the menace!   Things get a little sticky as the scenario continues.  A bit more reading  reveals that this isn't really a heavily-scripted adventure; actually, it's  more of a sourcebook with detailed encounter keys.  The PCs are given no  single incentive to go from point A to point B - and although the work is  impressive for its non-linearity, a bit of frustration sets in as the DM  realizes that at least 10 hours of preparation will be required (after the  preliminary reading) to make this adventure come to life.  But don't  let that throw you off!  The more you read, the more you realize that the  book is set up so that it can be perfectly customized to your campaign.   Even better, it gives exhaustive, detailed, and imaginative settings, many  of which are famous and well-known to long-time wanderers of Greyhawk:   Hardby, Elredd, Highport (at last!), and more are revealed for the first  time with well-planned encounters and many pages of lore.  What's mostly  lacking is the dungeon crawls - there's a few slaver outposts highlighted,  but the book's pages are mostly spent detailing the settings of the  adventures, rather than detailing the adventures themselves.  One of  the most impressive aspects of the sourcebook is the great ideas.  We're  treated to the ruined, shipwreck-dotted coastal village of Cantona, whose  non-Euclidean angles and magical wardings prevent summonings and  teleportation; the Yellow Tooth Kobolds of the Pomarj, who create makeshift  floating villages with which to harass the unwary; the Temple District of  Highport, where we get to read about the intriguing worshippers of Vecna,  Iuz, Incabulos, and more; and the return of Stalman Klim, with his  insidious plots to spread the Cult of the Earth Dragon throughout the  heartlands of the Flanaess.  The final \\"dungeon,\\" the Temple of the Earth  Dragon, is creative, fun, intense, and well-planned; but, this section is  abysmally short.  The hopeful DM is left with the idea that someone  cackled, threw a handful of ingenious ideas into a cauldron, and then...  forgot to stoke up the fire.  If you're looking for flashing blades,  sizzling spells, and piratical scenes of mayhem and drama, you'll likely be  disappointed.  But if you want an outstanding sourcebook that provides  lavish detail on some of the most eternally mysterious corners of Greyhawk  (which happen to be very close to the Free City itself), you'll find  Slavers to be an excellent resource, with the seeds of many potential  adventures.  May it live long and free!	2000-05-02

This is one of my all-time favorite adventures to entice  novices into the game - a wonderful story for levels 1-4.	2000-05-02

The town of Phlan in the Forgotten Realms is falling into ruin...  evil besets it on all sides, and the few scattered survivors of the trauma  have emboldened themselves enough to do something about the evil that lurks  within - they're going to cry havoc, charge in, and hire some foolish PCs  to mop the place up!  Yeah!  A classic, amusingly intense dungeon crawl  that will keep your players (levels variable, I'd say 1-8!) occupied for  months.	2000-05-02

For the first time in centuries, Empires hail one another in peace  - Thyatis and Alphatia finally meet in a tenuous, paranoid, historic  standoff.  The Known Realms send their mightiest heroes as the diplomatic  envoys, in a dramatic show of politely veiled force... and everything goes to  Hell in a handbasket as the God of Entropy shatters the stillborn alliance,  casting the PCs as scapegoats and throwing them to the wolves.  Now that  we've got through the introduction, 30 more pages of terror will torture  your players mercilessly for weeks!  Well, they said they wanted a  challenge...	2000-05-02

There's thousands of them - ingenious ones, wizardly ones,  invisible ones, and far worse - once the PCs face the enormous dragon,  they'll be relieved that it's something that's merely exactly what it  seems!

Even better, there's two different adventures, so after you victimize your  friend, they can turn the tables and show you just what it's like to be a  lone PC struggling for survival!

The overmatched heroes  (levels 3-5) will find themselves in an horrific underwater adventure that  plays more like an espionage movie than an AD&amp;D adventure - flashing  blades and spells will get them all killed in a matter of minutes.   Instead, they need to skulk through the ruins learning everything that they  can, in the desperate hope they might return with enough information for  the hopelessly overpowered Saltmarsh militia to save them from inevitable  destruction.	2000-05-02

WG4 is an excellent Greyhawk adventure written by Gary Gygax in 1982, but almost no one remembers it!  Even better, it forms the epic prequel to the legendary S4, Lost Caverns of Tsojcanth.   (Tharizdun - The Phantom Menace?)  I personally believe this is Gygax's  most bleak, mysterious, demonic, sinister, and gothic adventure, followed  closely by T1-4.

The Arch-Maga  Iggwilv was the most powerful sorceress of her age - she even imprisoned  demon lords and made them bow to her bidding!  And now, the realms of  Perrenland, Ket, and Iuz have begun yet another series of deadly forays in  search of her lost lair.  Should the heroes (levels 6-10) discover the  Caverns, they'll have a nightmarishly good time; the encounters are so  difficult (especially the finale against Iggwilv's demonic daughter!) that  I would recommend this for experienced players, levels 8-10 only.  Besides  all that, you get another 32-page booklet full of new spells, new monsters,  and new magic!  (This was the foundation for the Monster Manual II and  Unearthed Arcana.)

Although  the set was later refurbished in the 90s, many people prefer this set not  only for the nostalgia it provides, but also because the illustrations in  the campaign books are gorgeous and unforgettable.

But,  as the PCs should have learned from U1, nothing is even nearly that simple...  the lizard men are actually peaceful and intelligent, and are desperately  gathering their strength to stave off the imminent Sahuagin onslaught that  will soon obliterate them, and the Saltmarshers as well... if they PCs  (levels 1-4) can't learn the truth in this perfectly-scripted, dramatic  espionage adventure, their brief careers as heroes will end... a classic of  Greyhawk, highest recommendation.	2000-05-02

It's obvious that  this is a work for intermediate and advanced players, since some of the  races and classes here (and the attribute-rolling system!) are over-powered  for easier, beginning campaigns.  In addition to the dark races (such as  the Drow, Duergar, and Svirfneblin), and the advanced classes (such as the  Hierophant, Acrobat, Cavalier and my fave, the Barbarian), there's also new  weapons, hundreds of new spells, hundreds of new magical items, the deities  of the demi-humans, and much more.

Why?  How is it controlled? Well, the answer to that question is the easy part,  getting back home in one piece is the fun one... prepare yourselves for  giant dragonflies, lots of new monsters, pirates, spider swarms,  &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot; expeditions complete with cannon fodder  (um, I mean servants), and a nice arch-rival you might have heard of, goes  by the name of Tiamat...	2000-05-02

This adventure includes some  of the nastiest encounters ever devised for D&amp;D - my players still  cringe, a decade later, when I remind them about crossing that rickety  suspension bridge over the 200' ravine, while being pelted by boulders... a  wonderful, highly playable piece of nostalgia, not to be missed.	2000-05-02

In this chapter, the  heroes must journey with the iceships to Icewall Castle, to recover the  Dragon Orb from the evil white dragoness.

One of the most evil adventures for AD&amp;D; if you're the DM, of course, it's  also one of the most fun!

This is the Official RPGA Tournament Handbook - which actually didn't sell well at all back in the 80s, because most people assumed it was simply a dry manual of RPGA rulings.  Actually, though, this module has two huge, wonderfully-scripted \\"lost\\" adventures - Honor Guard and The Long Way Home,  each split into two rounds for either casual or competitive play!  Both are  extremely well-written examples of problem-solving dungeon crawls.  Even  better, you also get extensive notes on how to create and run your own RPGA  tournament adventures; there's even a complete submission form for allowing  the RPGA to publish your module and play it throughout the world, crediting  you as the designer!

The heroes of the realm have been challenged to \\"grow up\\" and establish baronies of their own, build castles, rule a frightened  populace, and explore the wilderness.  Then, of course, everything falls  apart... the PCs must fight an epic war and go on several adventures to  assure the survival of their newfound lands.  An amazingly ambitious scope,  which will take months to play out in its entirety.  Highly recommended!	2000-04-29

Well, if you're *really* old (cough cough), back in the 70s there was an epic classic called Temple of the Frog that appeared with the miniatures game Chainmail and the original Dungeons &amp; Dragons booklets.  Dave Arneson  (his buddy Gygax hadn't gotten around to writing any adventures yet!)  created an unforgettable \\"pulp\\" adventure reminiscent of Edgar Rice  Burroughs, in his fabled kingdom of Blackmoor.  People begged him to expand  on that story... he never did.  Until 1986!  Then, this RARE module was  finally released.  I think the cover art gives you an idea of the malicious  glee involved in throwing your PCs into this... an adventure for levels  10-14, easily converted to AD&amp;D; highest recommendation.	2000-04-29

In the realm of Greyhawk, Lord Justinian, Duke of Urnst, has finally located the legendary Soul Gem, the devourer... it once was held in the  indomitable Tower of Inverness, a lost ruin on the Woolly Bay.  Centuries  ago, the terrified masses pulled it into rubble, but its accursed  apparition can still be seen haunting the skies!  And now, in the name of  honor and filthy lucre, your VERY challenged PCs will find:  upside down  dungeons, horrors of air, earth, fire, and water, a cruelly fatal \\"chess  trap\\" chamber, a petrifyingly beautiful maiden, reverse gravity, and an  intelligent gem that literally sucks the life out of anyone who cannot  solve its conundrum.  (Don't worry - you'll get your soul back if it  doesn't kill all your friends :)  Hardcore adventure!	2000-04-29

For years, the Slavelords of the Pomarj have terrorized the  Wild Coast, ranging as far as Greyhawk itself; now, it's time to put an end  to the marauders!

This is probably the strangest, most completely unknown Greyhawk adventure ever made.  Dave Arneson's legendary Blackmoor (the first D&amp;D campaign, predating Greyhawk itself) is infamous as the dreaded lost land beyond the icy realm of Iuz.  Here, its secrets are revealed as the heroes (levels  10-14) travel through time back to its vaunted golden age, when technology  and magic brought unbelievable wonders to life, leading to the Cataclysm  that ended it all thousands of years ago... oddly, TSR decided to uproot  Blackmoor from the World of Greyhawk (1986 was when Gygax &amp; Co. were in  extremely ill favor), and shoved it into the world of Mystara.  It works  there, but this was truly intended as an adventure series for AD&amp;D!   Easily converted, and definitely worth the effort.	2000-04-29

The novice PCs are washed ashore upon the Lost Isle, without hope of survival; but luckily for them (?), they've found the  nether stronghold of the great exiled Magus, Castanamir.  Sure, he's evil,  but he also has quite a sense of humor, and down in these parts, every  couple decades or so he tends to get really lonely... oh by the way, he's  dead now, but don't worry, he's left quite a legacy for his minions, and  they've made a bit of a religious observance on the absurdity of reality!
