This book is a wonderful starting place for someone interested in the Hoodoo tradition.....Although there is some information pertaining to the Orishas that I disagree with, the formulary and recipes are very worthwile and the authors ability to compare Hoodoo to other African Diasporic Traditions is good!   <br /> <br />I would definately say buy this book, but read it in conjunction with Ray Marbough's book, Hoodoo Mysteries.  There are other resources out there from different publishing houses as well, you just have to sort through them. <br /> <br />A good value for the money.	2005-04-02

Having a rather large collection of books on Saints, Hagiogrpahy, Prayer, Meditation, Ritual, and Religion, I can honestly say that I think this book is one of my all-time  favorites!<br />Cowan includes a multitude of Saints that is sure to appear to the most general audience and provides the reader with a brief bio, prayer, and meditation/act to contemplate on.<br />Most people would think that this book would be only useful to Catholics, but that is not the case.  Any Christian would benefit by including the prayer exercises into their daily prayer and non-christians would benefit from reading about the people (saints) that helped shape the life of the Catholic church.<br />Highly recommended without any reservation!!!	2003-07-19

The Enchanted Astrologer is a fun way of learning the Zodiac, the different astological houses, the ruling planets, etc.  The artwork is very pretty and the readings are pretty accurate (but very general compared to the Tarot or another Oracle)!<br />I bought this set (Cards come with a How-to-Use book) on sale....after opening and using them, I wouldn't ever pay full price!  Recommended for the beginning Astrologer and/or Diviner.  Advanced Practioners will find this deck too bland and general for professional or regular usage.	2003-07-19

I originally bought this book hoping to find new styles, patterns, and detailed instructions to make the traditional Catholic style rosary.....however, what I ended up with was a wonderful tool explaining the meaning of rosaries and the spiritual significance and prayerful practice of making 'non-traditional' rosaries (Malas, Rosary Bracelets, Rosary Shawls, etc.).<br />Recommended for anyone who loves working with beads and incorporating beadwork into their spiritual practices.  Few photographs (black &amp; white only) and some crudely drawn (but user friendly) diagrams scarttered throughout the book.  A good book for beginners, but advanced and professional Rosary Artisans may find this reading dreadfully dull.<br />Overall, I enjoyed the book.  I paid full price, but would definately recommend buying it 2nd hand or when it is on sale!	2003-07-18

This booklet (smaller than a book, bigger than a pamphlet, with shiny and glossy pages like a magazine) is only 31 pages long, but is crammed with so much information regarding the Universal Catholic Church and the individual Rites that form the Communion!<br />The book outlines and superficially covers *most* of the individual Eastern Rite traditions, but definately leaves it up to the reader to further educate themselves in any sort of depth.<br />Pages 24-28 contain some excellent charts and graphs expounding further on the topic.  Crammed with beautiful little pictures and religious artwork.<br />Definately worth the price (as compared to an average cost of a magazine)!!!  Highly recommended!	2003-07-16

This gem of a book is one of Vanzant's best works yet!  <br />The book is broken down into twelve sections that each deal with a spiritual principal.  (Example:  January deals with Life, July deals with Understanding, September with Trust, etc.)  The readings for each day are truly inspirational, validating, and affirming for all of God's children!  At the end of the reading is an affirmation or thought/Meditation that you can focus on throughout the day!!  (I usually write about it in my own personal spiritual journal, once in the morning and once at night....to see how I fared!)<br />If you are interested in growing as a person and a spiritual being, then this is the book for you!  An excellent read that I have and will continue to recommend.	2003-07-16

Creative Cash by Barbara Brabec is THE book to have if you are considering turning your crafting hobby into a business and/or profession.<br />The book is written for a wide and general audience, with basics on the craft business industry, sales/marketing/promotion, legal info, even computer systems/information!  The chapters are written in such a way that if you don't need to read one (let's say that a particular chapter might not pertain to your situation) you can skip it and move on without missing a beat!  Brabec writes in an easily comprehensible form, in digestable segments, and gives lots of clear cut examples and success stories.<br />This book works as a great starting point and reference tool.  Highly recommended for adults of all ages, for both genders and long-time or newbie crafters/artisans!	2003-07-09

I gave this 'oracle' three stars based upon the beautiful artwork alone.<br />If you are looking for a Goddess based Oracle, I recommend trying your hand at the The Goddess Tarot.  (A bit more complicated if you are not used to reading tarot, but much more accurate and way more artistically moving!)<br />This is the kind of gift you give someone whom already has everything under the sun......or for any tarot/oracle collector.  Recommended under certain circumstances.	2003-07-05

This is a fully functioning tarot deck with recipes that somehow relate to the card being represented.  The deck is oversized so the cards are rather large.  <br />I only rated this deck three stars for what one of the other reviewers touched on......the recipes.  (Not the most creative or scrumptious dishes to come across your palate!)  The size was also important to me....I tend to dislike oversized cards as I find them difficult to divine with, but they are the perfect size for recipes......I guess you can't have it all!<br />Overall, still a great gift and I recommend it.	2003-07-05

The Londa Tarot is definately not the most 'beautiful' tarot deck in the world.....actually, at first I thought the cards were distorted looking and ugly; but then I started using them consistantly, and my divinations have never been more accurate, clear, and easy to read.<br />True, the artwork IS VERY stylized and at times kinda creepy....but there is also something very serene and beautiful about them as well.  <br />What is really important when purchasing a tarot deck is how they function....and this deck functions very well (with me at least!).  This is the deck that I use with friends, family, and for paying customers.  <br />Highly recommended!	2003-07-05

This is the perfect tarot deck for newbies or people interested in further understanding the Universal Waite Tarot.  Basically each card is one of the Universal Waite Tarot with a large margin (half blue/half orange....the color's tell you when a card is reversed) which convey's the individual card's meaning.<br />This is a highly recommended deck and wonderful divinatory tool!	2003-07-05

As is the style of all the Anna Riva books, the quality, size, language usage, and spelling leave a lot to be desired.  This book appears to be a compilation of all the other esoteric and useless stuff that couldn't be smooshed into any of the other Anna Riva books.

Love Magic is written by one of the USA's most famous (or infamous) Witches, Laurie Cabot.  The first half of this book explains what Love Magic is, how magic works, ritualism, astrological correspondences and such.  The second half of the book is basically a grimoire (or collection of practical spells) to attract, enhance or dispel love and relationships.  Contains two dated Appendices.  Overall, fun for getting in touch with witch inside.  Recommended for newbies to the craft and hardcare Cabot fans.	2003-06-29

Don't get me wrong.....the book is full of interesting information and facts, but the read is rather dry, and I lost interest numerous times before finally finishing.  The Medicine Wheel gives a rather comprehensive overview of Earth Astrology as viewed by the Chippewa Shaman Sun Bear and Wabun (Sun Bear's Medicine Helper).  Sun Bear has written numerous articles and papers, so his writing is held in fairly high esteem.  Still not one of my most enjoyable or readable books.  Recommended with reservation.	2003-06-29

Originally written in Portuguese by Brazilian gay rights advocate Joao Silverio Trevisan, and translated into English by Martin Foreman, Perverts in Paradise inaccurately describes the LBGT experience, culture, and history of Brazil.<br />The book, while entertaining and interesting leaves me with a lot of doubt and question as to what is reality and what is perceived reality from the author's perspective.  Anthropologically speaking, the methodology of writing such a book on a particular subject raises many issues and concerns.  I would definately consider this book a piece of literature and definately not academia.<br />The biggest problem I had with Perverts in Paradise is the chapter (Appendix) titled, Interview with a Babalorixa.  Umbanda, Quimbanda, Candomble, Witchcraft and all the afro-brazilian religious cults worst stereotypes seemed to portrayed and played on.  As a student of ATR's, I found this section heavily gay influenced and biased as well as disrespectful.<br />I'm glad I read the book as it has appeared in several other well written and respected anthropological/sociological bibliographies.  Overall, recommended for an entertaining read if taken with a grain of salt.	2003-06-26

Whether you are looking for a craft name or a legal name, this book offers you some 'magickal' options in a fun and informative manner.  Not the biggest of best name book on the market, but certainly the only one (that I am aware of) that is targeted to a Pagan audience.

This book is an amazing and masterful piece of work.  Due to the significant lack of material pertaining to the South Asian Diasporic LBGTQ community one can easily see the relevence and necessity for such a publication.  Personal, provacative, critical, analytical, cross-cultural, and ethnically specific are keywords that come to mind in reviewing this title.  Highly recommended for any LBGTQ person regardless of ethnicity.  A useful resource for any student pursuing academic studies in Queer Studies or South Asian Studies.  As relevent today as it was when it was first published!	2003-06-22

This book is solely a compilation of short testimonies of LBGT individuals and their faith journey within the Episcopal Church.  I was hoping that this book would be inspirational (it wasn't) and/or a teaching tool that I could use (I doubt it).  Some personal accounts were moving, but for the most part, as a Generation X'er, I felt that it was out of touch with the communities that I associate with.  This book MIGHT be useful for the general 'late-bloomer' whom is older and just coming into his/her sexuality and is questioning how to integrate their spirituality and faith....and some of the vignettes were quite moving.  Overall, just an OK book with an OK rating.	2003-06-10

This book (booklet really!) is a wonderful source for any Catholic whom has remotely been touched by HIV/AIDS.  It teaches and advises you on how to integrate your diagnosis into prayer and more specifically, to walk through your illness via the Stations of the Cross.  I must admit, I was a bit sceptical at first, but after reading and meditating on the content, I was convinced of this powerful little books value.  The book also has a section called &quot;Sources for Reflection&quot; that has a listing of Christian and Christ centered books dealing with HIV/AIDS and the Church.  (I bought my copy used, but would gladly pay the full retail price if that was not an option!)	2003-06-07

This short book of compiled letters reads well.  Full of personal and profound information regarding Fr. Arpin's life and formal dual recognition of his integrating HIV/AIDS status and sexuality into his personal, professional, and prayerful life.  Some of the information the good Father writes about is clearly dated, but that also adds to the charm and character of this book.  Truly inspirational and a perfect gift for any Catholic living with HIV/AIDS.	2003-06-07

Amado is one of my favorite writers, so it is no surprise that Jubiaba is a wonderful literary piece.  This book truly gives a glimpse of Bahian culture and the role of Afro-Brazilian religious traditions in the average Bahiano's daily life.  The book's cover and publishing is a bit dated, but like the old saying goes, &quot;don't judge this book by it's cover&quot;!	2003-04-23

This book surveys the wonderful and complex Afro-Brazilian Religion of Batuque!

This book has NOTHING to do with the Vodou religion as practiced ANYWHERE on this earth!  The author blends (unsuccessfully) Wicca, Lucumi, Santeria, Vodou, and Shamanism in an incomprehesible and unforgivable way!  This book is full of misinformation regarding the African Diasporic Religions!  The only positive thing I have to say regarding this piece of work is that the publishers obviously packaged it right!  (The cover is pretty and inviting!)  If you are looking for content, this is NOT the book for you!  If you are researching/studying the ATR's and Vodou.....keep searching....because this is not the book for you!

One of the best books that I could find in English on Candomble.<br />The book is an amazing piece of scholastic work conducted by a once relectant initiate of Nago-Ketu Nation and surveys the history, practices, theology, ritualism and cosmology of Candomble and the role of the Terreiro in historical and contemporary Brazilian society.<br />There are many things that I had issues with.....the title of the book being one of them.....but by far, it is the most substantial piece of work that has been published in English targeted in a non-sensationalist way for the non-brazilian public.<br />This thought provoking piece of work has led me to look internally and externally for answers to questions raised in this forum, and has also allowed me to formulate my own questions......<br />In any case, the book is worth adding to any library and especially of value to those individuals interested in African Based Diasporic religion/spirituality in Brazil.	2003-02-24

This book researches Umbanda (as practiced in Southern Brazil) and the socio-politics associated with it from the 1930's to 1970's.  <br />This book is wonderful for the seasoned and culturally competent person whom has a firm working knowledge of Brazil and Afro-Brazilian religions, but does not offer much for those interested in the various rites and rituals associated with the religion.<br />Overall, a good purchase......one of the very few works done on this most fascinating truly Brazilian religion.	2002-12-15

The book, while full of interesting facts and data regarding traditional and indegenious religions in Africa, is quite frankly, a dull read!  The book tends to be overly clinical and does not delve deep into any one particular ATR.....in fact, one of the biggest sections on Yoruban religion is minimal.
