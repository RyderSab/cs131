US	52940881	R3VJ07YQBK1V13	0446607274	515249324	Angels Flight (Harry Bosch)	Books	4	2	2	N	N	Good reading on your handheld device	I downloaded this detective procedural in electronic format and read it on my Palm during my commute to work.  Better than the usual, routine story about a murder, this novel focuses on the tensions between the LAPD and the people of Los Angeles in the wake of the Rodney King incident.  It's an entertaining read with substance, as the plot touches on the racial biases and political issues that play an often unacknowledged role in law enforcement in a contemporary urban environment.<br /><br />I've found e-books to be economical, as they are often priced several dollars less than a mass market paperback, and they can be easily moved to an external storage device after I'm done reading them on my handheld.  And since I have to carry my Palm around with me everyday in order to access my calendar and contacts files, an electronic book eliminates the need to carry printed reading material, and thus reduces the weight in my shoulder bag.<br /><br />Michael Connelly's books are particularly appropriate for the handheld medium because they are plot-driven page-turners that don't require me to check footnotes or an index.  I'm not sure I'd be equally enthusiastic about using the electronic format for a text book or research report.	2005-09-02

Prestsowitz gives the big picture, citing the probable causes for some of the effects, both intended and unintended, of American encouragement of a global economy that is based on the dollar as the main unit of international currency.  While this may sound off-putting and give the impression that this book is dry and forbidding, that is far from the case.<br /><br />Prestowitz explains in straightforward language what has happened now that China, India and other Southeast Asian nations participate in capitalist markets, outlining the consequences for the US and, to some extent, Europe and the rest of the developed world.  Reading this book, I came to understand that it's not simply about \\"greedy corporations\\" moving jobs offshore, but also involves the US government's failure to develop and promote a clear industrial policy.  This book takes the intelligent reader beyond the standard story frames presented on the nightly news to a much deeper, more subtle understanding of why globalization is, in the long run, probably good for America, but is, in the short run, going to be painful for some of our citizens.  That will be especially true if we continue to cling to our old notions that the federal government should keep its \\"hands off\\" the economy.  Instead, Prestowitz argues, Americans should accept the idea that a sensible national industrial policy is not the same thing as a command and control, government-directed economy (aka socialism), the fear of which seems to be ingrained in our national consciousness.<br /><br />Initially, I was a bit skeptical about Prestowitz, since he was an official in the Reagan Administration and I thought he might have a political axe to grind in terms of his view of globalization. Happily, that is not the case, at least as far as I can determine from my solidly amateur status as an armchair economist.  This is a thoughtful book that is loaded with little \\"aha\\" insights for the average citizen who wants to have a clearer understanding of what is happening economically in the world today.  After reading this book I will never look at a newscast or a newspaper in quite the same way again, and that's a good thing.ghts for the average citizen who wants to have a clearer understanding of what is happening economically in the world today.

US	52940881	R1BF02BG2NPM4Z	0060011912	452541514	Small Town	Books	4	20	22	N	N	A little bit twisted, but a good page-turner	I suspect that the reason this novel hasn't received a higher overall rating on Amazon is because of the character, Susan Pomerance, who is -- to put it politely -- sexually kinky in the extreme, and whose exploits doubtless were a turn off to many Lawrence Block fans, who don't expect this kind of soft porn in his books.<br /><br />I didn't much like Susan either.  At first I thought Block had made a major error in giving her a prominent role in the novel, and even after finishing Small Town with a considerable degree of satisfaction I still think it would have been a more comfortable book without Susan.  That said, I have also come to realize that Block included Susan for the express purpose of making his readers uncomfortable.  After all, Small Town is a book about the aftermath of 9/11, a time during which no New Yorker I know was anywhere near comfortable.  Those of us who survived the attack -- whether or not we had family and friends who perished -- were all affected.  Ultimately, life went on, just as it does for the characters in Small Town, but life was surely different, and probably always will be.<br /><br />I think Block's view is that 9/11 literally unhinged many New Yorkers.  The blasts at the Towers shattered our assumptions and expectations every bit as much as they shattered steel, glass and human lives, with the result that some of us, including Block's characters, dramatically changed our life views and, consequently, our behaviors.  Seen in this light, Susan's behavior becomes more understandable, if not acceptable.<br /><br />And Susan aside, the others characters, particularly the Carpenter, are very well drawn.  They operate in what is essentially a new world, which changed within the space of a couple of hours and which forces them to confront their fears and privledges in a way they never have.  And the plot offers all of the suspense and credible detail we have come to expect from Block.  It kept me turning pages into the night, which is, for me, the acid test of a good book.<br /><br />So, if you enjoy a good story and don't mind being challenged by an unexpected anti-heroine like Susan, read Small Town, whose main character is, in the end, New York City itself.hich is, for me, the acid test of a good book. <br /> <br />So, if you enjoy a good story and don't mind being challenged by an unexpected anti-heroine like Susan, read Small Town, whose main character is, in the end, New York City itself.	2005-08-11

Henry ponders the various events that occurr during his day off, a Saturday, as he moves about doing chores and preparing to make dinner for his family that evening.  The day begins with Henry witnessing a flaming airplane flying overhead, an event that evokes thoughts of terrorism and 9/11, and eeriely presages the recent London bombings.  The day ends with Henry performing brain surgery on a young man who has invaded his home and attacked his family.  In between, Henry has occasion to ponder life, death, his own mortality and his very reductionist beliefs that amount to, in short -- when you're dead, that's the end.  Nothing before, nothing after.  But even as he affirms to himself his credentials as a scientist (and thus, an atheist) Henry is struggling to read and appreciate the literature his adult daughter assigns him, as well as the poetry she writes.  And he also finds himself transported by a blues song performed for him that day by his musician son.  Throughout the novel, Henry teeters between the science of his profession, and the arts practiced by his children, coming at novel's end to terms, more or less, with life's basic ambiguities, and feeling grateful for the range of experiences available to him.<br /><br />Through the behaviors and comments of the supporting characters -- Henry's wife, children, father-in-law, and Baxter, the thug who attacks the family -- the reader is given the opportunity to compare not so much various beliefs as various ways of coping with the central question of human life: knowledge of one's own mortality.<br /><br />This is literary fiction of a high order, and highly recommended.<br /><br />Disclaimer:  Although we share a surname, I am not to my knowledge related to Ian McEwan.  Nevertheless, I feel some odd obligation to read his novels, although not a commitment to praise them, on the off chance that we are shirt-tale cousins, connected by some clansman whose name is lost in time.aimer:  Although we share a surname, I am not to my knowledge related to Ian McEwan.

It offers lots of interesting tales and stories about life on Cape Cod and the Islands from pre-Colonial times through the present, and also is one of the few books that actually treats the Native Americans in enough depth to provide the reader with an appreciation for how essential the natives' contributions were to the survival of the early European settlers.  It also makes it quite clear that the natives no doubt regretted their helpfulness in short order, having been kidnapped, stolen from and otherwised abused by the newcomers very soon after they landed.<br /><br />I always enjoy reading books about the places I visit while I'm there, so The Enduring Shore was perfect for my vacation to the outer Cape earlier this month.  Schneider's discussion of the geology of the Cape is fascinating, and I will look at its cliffs and sandy beaches in a more knowing, deeper way henceforth.<br /><br />I like to have two or more books going at once, usually one nonfiction and one fiction.  A good complementary novel to read in conjunction with The Enduring Shore is William Martin's Cape Cod, which offers an abundance of useful and interesting facts about the Cape while delivering them in the context of a family saga that is perfect for beach reading.<br /><br />I reecommend The Enduring Shore for anyone who is interested in how the Cape got that way and why it matters to so many of us today.	2005-07-14

The plot of this novel drew me in quickly, right from the first few pages, and the scenes and action moved along at a good pace through the book's end.<br /><br />Without giving away the ending, let me say that the fate of the evil Eddie was highly satisfying and, while other reviewers' complaints about the heroine, Carole, do resonate with me, I did not ultimately find her tiresome.  Rather, I liked watching her reach the boiling point and finally taking sweet revenge on Eddie for tormenting her all those years.<br /><br />In some ways, this book reminds me of two others I enjoyed:  The Secret History by Donna Tart and The Lake of Dead Languages by Carol Goodman, both of which tell stories of young people with dark secrets.<br /><br />Tart's book is truly superior and a 5 all the way, but I can see how Lewis might eventually work up to writing of Tart's quality, especially given her talent for characterization.  The heroine's hippie friend, Rachel, for instance, is so like women I knew in the 60s that I felt I almost knew her personally.<br /><br />Speak Softly, She Can Hear is a very good debut novel that is worthy of your attention if you enjoy well-written suspense stories.	2005-07-14

The plot centers on an event that happened years in the past, which not surprisingly provokes consequences in the lives of the main characters in the present. And the ending is a real surprise, unlike many novels of this sort.<br /><br />I'm often able to figure out the twists and turns of a novel's plot, but this ending really blind-sided me, and for that reason alone I'm giving it 4 stars.  If you're looking for a diverting paperback to read on vacation this summer, Just One Look will fill the bill nicely.	2005-07-07

I enjoyed this book very much, even though I am certain that it contains enough provocative statements to offend nearly everyone, from every political stripe and social stance.  The well-known bit about abortion being responsible for the drop in urban crime is just the beginning.  Levitt and his co-author, Steven Dubner of the New York Times, also contend that parenting doesnt' matter much in terms of a child's school performance, and also that school choice doesn't matter that much either.<br /><br />The evidence that they marshall to support their claims seems convincing and, in any event, is very interesting if the reader can keep an open mind.  I found some of my closely held beliefs challenged by the analysis in this book, and also had a couple of good laughs in response to the clever writing style.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this book to anyone who has a curiosity about the world and who is open to new and sometimes challenging ideas.  It's an easy read, yet full of insights that will stick with you for days afterward.	2005-06-07

It would also be good for a long airplane ride, as it holds the reader's attention without being overly taxing intellectually.<br /><br />There are a couple of clever plot twists too, and I found the characters quite likable.

Unlike so many novels of this sort, the plot is not obvious, yet it is also an easy read for an airplane trip or a commute to work on the train.<br /><br />The characters are well drawn.  Nina Reilly, the attorney hero, is likable and the other primary characters have enough complexity to be believeable.  The reader knows right away who the good guys are, but the murderer is not immediately identified.<br /><br />Overall, this is a very good novel that will hold the attention of an intelligent reader without offering too much challenge to be easily entertaining.  If you enjoy page turners and don't want to drag a big, hardcover book around town, this book is for you.	2005-05-12

Thus, I am giving Decipher a pretty high rating in comparison to the critics' reviews.  At the time I purchased this paperback, I was looking for an interesting story that would not have a predictable outcome, would not be a sappy romance, nor be about a serial killer.  Decipher fit the bill nicely, and provided a good page-turning read for my daily commute to work on the train.<br /><br />In essence, the story knits together many of the current so-called \\"new age\\" ideas proffered by Granham Hancock, Edgar Cayce and even Joseph Campbell and Plato.  It offers a plausible (OK, barely plausible) scenario in which the ancient tales of Atlantis, as well as some of the Biblical stories of Genesis and Revelation, turn out to be based on fact.  Throw in some unanswered speculation about ancient civilizations that had advanced technologies, along with some scientific theories about quantum mechanics, and you have the plot line to Decipher.<br /><br />The characters are not terribly strong, nor are they particularly loveable, but that didn't bother me much because for me the value of this novel is in its story line and the ideas that underlie the plot.  If you like science fiction and are the type of person who wonders \\"What If...?\\" about all sorts of esoteric topics, then you also might enjoy this novel.	2005-05-02

First of all, its descriptions of urban blight in the neighborhoods of Tokyo and the bleak lives led by the women who live there are haunting and portrayed in a way that allowed me to identify with the characters even though I have never visited Japan and don't know much about its culture.  I came to genuinely care about the characters, even though they are not particularly lovable and, in fact, do some clearly evil things.<br /><br />And there are some dark moments of humor that caught me off guard but provided some relief at points in the plot where the suspense had become a bit too intense.  I don't want to give away the plot, so if you plan to read this book and don't want to know too much about the story, stop reading here.<br /><br />In a nutshell, a small group of women who work the night shift in a depressing factory end up, through a series of incremental circumstances, butchering dead human bodies for money.  Odd as it sounds, their actions are at times quite comical, even though this is most certainly not a humorous novel.  The author writes with such nuanced descriptions that I could easily picture the most unlikely activities being done by characters who turn out to be quite surprising, and that adds a sort of perverse twist to the story line that kept me captivated as I sat up late at night turning the pages.<br /><br />I believe that the translator may deserve as much credit as the author for the success of this novel in English.  It seems to me that the subtlties of the setting, tone and characters must have been very precisly rendered by the translator, since I had no trouble at all identifying with certain characters and intensely disliking others. One of the women who is quite unlovable, Kuniko, ended up elicting a certain degree of sympathy from me in the end, which I thought was quite an accomplishment given that this character's personality is truly distasteful.  I would say that this is an accomplishment of both the author and the translator, since Kuniko is obviously intended to put readers off and serve as a foil of sorts for the heroine (or perhaps more aptly, anti-heroine), Masuko.<br /><br />So, if you want to read a crime novel that is a cut above most and that truly engages the reader by raising some serious questions about poverty, gender and power, Out is for you.ded up elicting a certain degree of sympathy from me in the end, which I thought was quite an accomplishment given that this character's personality is truly distasteful.

However, after about 30 pages or so, once the Jillian character and her plant, Fred, are introduced, I began to suspect I'd made an error.  By that time I was trapped on a cross-country flight with nothing else to read.  Thus, I finished this novel, but certainly would not have if there had been something else to occupy me on the red-eye.<br /><br />The characters are really lame, especially Jillian, but also the \\"mad scientist\\" fellow and Parish Lantern, whose name is supposedly symbolic, but in the end seems just dumb. And the plot is certainly not up to what I expected from Dean Koontz.<br /><br />I have read only one other of Koontz's books, but as I recall that one was much more engaging than By the Light of the Moon.  Perhaps this is merely an abberation, but I will definitely be cautious about buying another Koontz novel, and never without some back-up entertainment.  What a bore!	2005-03-30

While I still don't feel I can say for certain that I believe David Wilcock IS Cayce, I certainly find Wilcock plausible, mostly because the voice of Ra sounds a great deal like Cayce's Source.<br /><br />To Wilcock, Ra speaks far more directly than did Cayce's Source, however I tend to accept the explanation offered by this book's author, Wynn Free, that as Cayce's \\"Source,\\" Ra presented ideas and information to Cayce in a form consistent with Cayce's fundamentalist Christainity.  What's important here is that the concepts offered by Ra to Wilcock are highly similar to those offered to Cayce by his Source.<br /><br />But whether Wilcock is, or is not, Cayce's reincarnation isn't that important, and finding the answer to that question really is not the reason to buy this book.  The book is valuable for the elegant language and powerful ideas expressed by Ra to Wilcock, as well as for the two final chapters, which are reprints of text written by Wilcock that describe an astounding, and believable, way of understanding the nature of reality.  Also, one of the final chapters is an exposition of what Wilcock calls \\"the energetic engine of evolution,\\" which in and of itself is worth the purchase price of the book.<br /><br />Many of the ideas attributed to Ra are not new to me.  What is new is Ra's fresh and clear way of explaining them, and the inspirational impact of the readings that Wilcock channels from Ra.  These are so good that I have shared them with several like-minded friends, and also made copies for myself so that I can read portions immediately before or after I meditate.<br /><br />One of the things I find convincing about Wilcock is that he has consistently presented free of charge nearly all of his research and readings on several web sites, the addresses of which are noted in the book.  His motivation appears to be a genuine desire to share Ra's message with others, rather than to enrich or glorify himself.<br /><br />There is a lot of junk in print these days, and a lot of people claiming to be psychic when what they actually are is opportunistic, but Wilcock, and probably by extension those individuals who are associated with him, is the real deal.  Buy this book and judge for yourself.  I don't believe you'll be disappointed.motivation appears to be a genuine desire to share Ra's message with others, rather than to enrich or glorify himself. <br /> <br />There is a lot of junk in print these days, and a lot of people claiming to be psychic when what they actually are is opportunistic, but Wilcock, and probably by extension those individuals who are associated with him, is the real deal.

So, OK, I get that Winegardner is not Mario Puzo and that this book is not written in the way that Puzo would write it.  How could it be?  These are two different authors writing in two different times.  But I think Winegardner delivers much of what can be reasonably expected of a novel like this -- entertainment that's not too challenging a read, suitable for an airplane ride or diversion on a snowy weekend at home.<br /><br />It's important not to confuse this novel with the Godfather films, in which some characters appear who are different from those in Puzo's books.  People who expect a continuation of the movie plot lines will be disappointed.<br /><br />But Winegardner does come up with his own versions of how Puzo's main characters develop and grow.  Take Fredo, for instance, whom Winegardner expands beyond the one-dimensional dimwit depicted in the original novel and in the films.  Here, Fredo is much more sympathetic, so that while one can still see that he is not the sharpest knife in the drawer, the reader is less inclined to dismiss him as simply a craven moron.<br /><br />I also enjoyed the new novel's addition of characters such as Sonny Corleone's twin daughters, Francesca and Kathy, and the Shea brothers, who are clearly meant to evoke John and Robert Kennedy.  And the way that Francesca and Kathy deal with Francesca's philandering husband, Billy Van Ardsdale, is a truly inspired plot twist.<br /><br />I would recommend this novel to those looking for a pleasant diversion; but if you take your Mafia stories too seriously you are likely to be disappointed.  Watch reruns of the Sopranos instead.	2005-01-27

This is quite a trick considering the somber nature of the story.<br /><br />I would strongly recommend Night Fall to any reader who enjoys solid entertainment and also likes to root for a book's main characters.  Corey is a highly likable hero, as are the women in the story, and it feels good to read something that takes a clear moral position on a topic that sometimes seems too full of nuance and ambiguity.	2005-01-17

Anna leaves on a short trip for Italy without telling her best friend and without giving a full explanation to the surrogate father of her child -- a gay man who is busy juggling the pieces of his own life in a way that is similar to Anna.  The one difference is that Anna does not have a current love relationship, which according to one of the plot strands is the reason she went to Italy.<br /><br />When she doesn't return as scheduled, Anna's best friend and the child's father end up caring for the kid and trying to decide what could have happened to Anna and at what point they should notify the authorities.  Here the plot bogs down a bit, as the father, the friend, the child and the father's lover have a lot of interchange that is presumably supposed to be highly meaningful, but which I found a bit tiresome.<br /><br />The portion of the book that moves along at a strong pace is the plot thread that posits a sinister reason for Anna's absence -- that she has been kidnapped by a serial killer who is searching for his great love.  The suspense is very well developed in this section of the novel and comprises the primary reason that one would want to read this book.<br /><br />Many people seem to enjoy Sarah Dunant more than I do.  While I like her choice of story topics, I find that once I'm into her book she loses me along way.  This is the second of her novels I've read (the other being The Birth of Venus) in which I find her attempts at meaningful dialogue do not, as I assume is intended, reveal the complexities of her characters.  Rather, the dialogue seems to further obscure her characters' motivations and feelings, and I wonder if that may not be her intention after all.<br /><br />In any case, Mapping the Edge is worth reading for its inventive structure, especially the artful way that Dunant creates interfaces between the two plot strands:  both incorporate a souvenir horse sculpture that she is brining home to her daughter, for example.  This will not be the best novel you'll read this year, but it is a cut above the usual fare.terfaces between the two plot strands:  both incorporate a souvenir horse sculpture that she is brining home to her daughter, for example.

In this novel, the author uses an unusual device for moving the hero around in time -- a potion that he drinks takes him to a time where he seems to have emotional connections with the people he meets.<br /><br />While he is walking about in the past, in this case the Middle Ages, he is unseen by the people of the time.  And in another interesting twist, while his mind is firmly experiencing past events, his body remains in the present, walking around the same terrain that his mind is exploring in the past. This means that his body can encounter present physical barriers that did not exist in the past, and vice versa.  That makes for some oddly humorous, as well as dangerous scrapes for the hero.  He is routinely injured, and one of his friends actually dies during time travel when he walks into a moving freight train.<br /><br />This time travel device used by Du Maurier reminded me of the technique empolyed by Carl Sagan in his novel, Contact.  Bear with me here, because this similarity is not as far-fetched as it might seem at first.  In Sagan's book, the heroine travels through space/time to meet aliens, even though it looks to observers on the ground as though she went nowhere.  Her body remains in the spacecraft, but somehow her mind makes the journey solo.  This is essentially the same device used in the House on the Strand, although the latter has additional nice touches, such as a bond between the characters of both centuries and the land on which they live.<br /><br />Overall, this is a very good adventure with a moral undercurrent that is subtle and resists being too \\"in-your-face\\" preachy.  For me, that underlying message has to do with being present for one's life and resisting the impulse to spend too much time living in your head, regardless of how compelling you might find your own thoughts.	2004-12-05

The corruption comes from the fact that people have learned how to digitize their personalities and download themselves into new, or alternate, bodies at will -- for a price of course.  This has led to dominance of society by the wealthy, who have ample funds to procure and switch bodies and, to a large extent, are protected from feeling the consequences of their mistakes. (What else is new?)  Thus, the Earth dwellers tend to have an arrogance about life that is more pronounced than on other planets where human digitization is less frequent.<br /><br />On the face of it, humans would seem to be immortal.  As one reads this amazing novel, however, you come to suspect that there is something missing in these digital personalities, and that their moral bankruptcy is less a result of their arrogance, wealth and ennui than it is of something more sinister -- like the absence of a soul.  It becomes clear that in the course of entering and leaving multiple bodies -- or \\"sleeves\\" as bodies are called -- some small portion of a person's memory is lost.  This inevitably poses the question:  At what point does this duplicated personality (who is having new experiences that the original personality did not) become someone altogether new and unique?<br /><br />Working amidst the backdrop of this high-tech existential dilema is Kovacs, descended from the Slavs and Japanese who colonized his home planet, Harlan's World.  Retained against his will by a long-lived Earth dweller who is centuries old (referrerd to as a \\"meth\\" for Methusala), Kovacs must solve a mystery if he is to get his sweetheart out of \\"storage,\\" which is a sort of prison where her personality is stored in digital format.<br /><br />Kovacs encounters a host of odd personalities and dangerous situations in the course of his work, but ultimately solves the puzzle -- to his satisfaction at least, if not to that of all the other characters.  Along the way, the reader is treated to a lot of very clever manifestations of \\"the way things work\\" in Morgan's future universe.  He offers us nifty new inventions and customs, as well as new twists on old ideas.  In the end, even though the surface characteristics of Morgan's future are drastically different from our world of today, the basic human motivations, fears and aspirations are pretty much the same.  And that is the pleasure of this book.  People are people, no matter where, or when, you go.<br /><br />Takeshi Kovacs is a hip new hero who provides intelligent entertainment for readers, and who is likely to go on doing so in future novels of the series.  I enjoyed Altered Carbon very much and am looking forward to reading more about Takeshi Kovacs from Richard Morgan.timately solves the puzzle -- to his satisfaction at least, if not to that of all the other characters.

US	52940881	RDWW87T0ZRE54	0375414738	325828858	The Warlord's Son	Books	5	16	19	N	N	Powerfully engaging	The Warlord's Son is a highly enjoyable suspense tale set in Pakistan and Afghanistan just after 9/11.  Stan Kelly, called Skelly, is an American war correspondent past his prime who has taken one last assignment in an attempt to write the ONE BIG STORY of his career.  He hires a \\"fixer\\" -- the local person who knows the ins and outs of the culture and can also serve as translator -- called Najeeb, the title character, who is the black sheep son of a Pashtun warlord.  Between Skelly and Najeeb they find themselves in a labyrinth of plots and sub-plots, all revolving around who will control Afghanistan.<br /><br />Skelly wants the story.  For Najeeb, things are more complicated.  While both characters are very well drawn, Najeeb is of particular interest in that he is trapped between the world of his childhood in the wild Tribal Areas of Pakistan and the world of his young adult life, which includes college in the U.S. and a relationship with a Muslim woman who is struggling to find a place in society where she can be both faithful to her religion and to her aspiration to be self-directed.<br /><br />The book feels very authentic in terms of plot, character development and setting, with an evocative sense of place that helped me better appreciate the connections that people have to their ancestral lands.  Dan Fesperman is very good at illustrating the complexities of the social and political situation along the Afghanistan-Pakistan border.  At one point as I was reading along, I was struck by the realization of just how little we Americans understand the terms of life in that part of the world, and how we probably never will get a real clue.  It is very far away indeed from places most of us comprehend.<br /><br />That's not to say that I didn't empathize with the novel's characters; on the contrary I did.  Fesperman is exceptionally talented at helping his characters convey the human emotions we all share, and at challenging his readers to inspect once again the opinions we have formed in the wake of 9/11 and subsequent events.  Plus, The Warlord's Son works as a first-rate adventure story.<br /><br />I have not so thoroughly enjoyed a novel since reading The Kite Runner a few months ago and highly recommend The Warlord's Son to anyone who likes good stories that make you question your assumptions, and your privledge.he opinions we have formed in the wake of 9/11 and subsequent events.

US	52940881	R3J1X8RDMS2ESA	0449213803	445698117	Caravans	Books	4	9	10	N	N	Very good historical perspective on Afghanistan	Like many Americans, my interest in Afghanistan was peaked (to say the least) by the events of 9/11.  Since then, I have done a good deal of reading about that nation and its people, both fiction and history.  This early work of Michener's is set in the Afghanistan of the 1960s, which I found helpful in that it presents some context that shows how the rapid pace of change has affected the tribal peoples, and how differing responses to new technologies created rifts within Afghan society.<br /><br />The story is told from the perspective of an American and, in fact, focuses on the experiences of an American woman who marries an Afghan man.  This has its plusses and minuses, but I found that the Western perspective of the characters helped me understand the interplay between our culture and the cultures of the various Afghan tribes that are included in the novel.<br /><br />While I understand that historical fiction has its limitations and that the events of the story aren't \\"real\\" in the strict sense, I find that good fiction that is based on a solid understanding of historical events helps me to fully appreciate what it must have been like to live during the time and in the place discussed.  Thus, I usually read both fiction and nonfiction books about topics that interest me.<br /><br />Michener is one of the best writers of historical fiction and, while this is an early example of his work, Caravans is well worth reading for its strong sense of place and historical detail that the book provides.	2004-10-20
US	52940881	R1PBK1B55BY1ES	044661372X	703746704	Derailed	Books	5	1	1	N	N	Great traveling companion	This is a terrific page-turner that will keep you entertained and hold your interest, even if you're stuck in the airport or sitting in a waiting room somewhere.<br /><br />I don't want to give away the plot, but let me just say that nothing in this book is as it seems.  Just when you think you've figured out what's REALLY going on, a new fact pops to make you think again.  And it has some chilling moments too, that made me identify with the characters and read on into the night when I should have really been getting my beauty rest.<br /><br />Often when I find a good page-turner, I am ultimately disappointed with the ending.  Not so with Derailed, which kept its grip on me from the first through the final page.  There's not a lot of edification or literary challenge here, which is fine because I was seeking good old escapism from this book, and that's what it delivers.  Derailed offers solid entertainment and excellent diversion.  Now that this novel is out in paperback, it's an even better value for your money.	2004-10-20
US	52940881	R1P6YHDX8NLTV2	0385338031	540697136	Absent Friends	Books	3	13	20	N	N	Good, but oddly unsatsifying	The comment in the Amazon review that this novel is primarily a character study is dead on.  I found the personalities and interplay among the main characters interesting, but do not view the events of the story as significant enough to warrant the term \\"tragedy\\" in the classic literary sense.  Rather than being tragic, the tale of Jimmy and his childhood pals feels like an inexorable march to a doomed fate, with one misunderstanding piled upon another until none of the characters has a clear picture of what is actually taking place in the story.<br /><br />And while I don't want to give away the end of the story, I will say that I found it depressing in that everyone ends up alone and unhappy, and what's worse, neither the characters nor the reader has much idea why, or what any of the characters might have done to change things.  Perhaps that's exactly the point that Rozan is trying to make -- that our lives are pretty much determined from the time we're born and that we're prisoners of genetics.  If that's the case, I'll pass on her philosophy.<br /><br />Certainly the events of 9/11 were tragic, but this book is about much more than the terrorist attack.  As a New Yorker, I have first-hand experience of the attack and its aftermath, and understand how 9/11 underlies all of what most of us do each day.  Nevertheless, Rozan fails to convince me that the actions of her characters are driven by the events of 9/11 or that they are responding to events in their daily lives in any way differently than they would had the attack never taken place.<br /><br />This novel is worth reading, but wait until it comes out in paperback and is less expensive.	2004-10-14

I use this as a text book in a graduate course that I teach and find it useful in giving students a clear idea of how social marketing relates to the broader topic of nonprofit marketing, without requring them to wade through all of the additional information that a more general marketing textbook would offer.  Author Alan Andreason is a leading thinker on the topic of social marketing and has organized this relatively short book in a straightforward manner that makes it easy to separate the preparatory work from the actual execution of social marketing plans.<br /><br />The one complaint I have about this book, and the reason that I have not awarded it five stars, is that the examples used are less than exciting and I find that I need to supplement this book with additional titles so that my students get the bigger picture of how social marketing principles play out in various cultures around the world, not just in the United States.  For those who are looking to expand their understand of social marketing in the developing world and in emerging economies, see also Marketing the Public Sector by Seymour Fine.  Sadly, this great book is a bit dated, as it was published in 1992, but balanced with this Andreason book (or a comparable book by Philip Kotler) you will be able to give yourself a solid grasp of the topic.	2004-10-09
US	52940881	R1YWQW44A2IU92	1401352197	624026753	Sammy's Hill: A Novel	Books	3	8	15	N	Y	Good of its sort	Considering the wide range in quality within the \\"chick-lit\\" genre, Sammy's Hill is a decent book.  There are some laugh-out-loud moments and some situations that many women will recognize, whether or not they have ever worked in D.C. or a similar environment.<br /><br />However,the characters are poorly drawn, especially the lead character, Samantha Joyce, who is both unappealing and unbelievable.  Some of the neurotic habits of \\"Sammy\\" are especially incredible, such as preventing herself from using her right arm while rushing to get ready for work so that she will be prepared in case she is ever disabled.  While I might believe that some mentally compromised woman could do such a thing, I certainly can't believe it of a person who is also supposed to be a successful top legislative aid to a United States Senator.  Sure, I accept that some outwardly successful people have interior mental challenges, but the idea that a deeply obsessive compulsive personality could not only survive, but thrive, in the pressured environment of Capitol Hill is a bit far fetched, regardless of what some might think of the competency of government appointees.<br /><br />Also, I found the plot of this novel to be predictable and the relationships between the characters to be unconvincing.  The one strong aspect of the book is its sense of place, with Gore offering up details of D.C. life with which she is no doubt quite familiar.<br /><br />All of that said, I still give this novel three stars because it doesn't pretend to be anything that it's not.  Clearly, Sammy's Hill is meant to be an easy, humorous read for young women still looking for Mr. Right.  For that sort of novel, it is certainly an acceptable example of the genre and quite likely a welcome diversion from the hunt.	2004-10-03
US	52940881	R3OFOQ5RNVBOQG	1594480001	659516630	The Kite Runner	Books	5	10	11	N	Y	Extraordinarily Good Novel	I really loved this novel and recommend it to anyone who enjoys reading stories that evoke a powerful sense of time and place. This novel is set primarily in Afghanistan, both before and after the Russian invasion, and contains a wealth of detail about life in that country, which most Americans know little about, despite our intimate involvement with Afghanistan after September 11.<br /><br />But beyond the sense of place, The Kite Runner features very well drawn characters.  There are the \\"hero\\" figures of Amir, Hassan and Baba, but also secondary characters like Rahim Kahn, the General and Assef, who provide a complete picture of the various personalities and backgrounds that combined to create Afghan society today.<br /><br />I also enjoyed the depictions of the Afghan emigre community in California, as these snapshots gave me a sense of the immigrant experience and the conflicts that are present when one leaves one homeland to adopt another.<br /><br />I haven't read a novel in awhile that I wished wouldn't end, but this is the sort of feeling I had while reading the final few pages of The Kite Runner.  This is a good book for reading in a book club, as you will find yourself wanting to discuss the characters' motivations and plot elements with a friend.  I highly recommend it.	2004-09-26

However, it was somewhat disappointing in that it was not as funny as I thought it would be, given the glowing reviews it has received here on Amazon.<br /><br />It seems to me that writing fiction about vampires, even when it is intended to be humorous, requires an ability to make the characters exceptionally believable, in that the basic premise of these stories rests on the reader's willingness to accept the existence of vampires and related beings.  Davidson lacks the skill level to pull this off entirely, so while there are some good moments in this book, I was left feeling that much more could have been done in the way of character development and creating a convincing set of physical \\"rules\\" for the way vampires function in the world.<br /><br />If you like vampire fiction that doesn't take itself too seriously, try something by Elaine Bergstrom.  These are not chick lit, but they have their humorous moments, and they are more satisfying than the Davidson series.	2004-09-26

While the author does comment on Osama from time to time, the real interest of the book is her insider's perspective on how the Saudi Arabs behave, the women as much as the men.<br /><br />I found myself having a lot of compassion for people who live so bifurcated a life as the author says the Saudis do.  She relates many instances of Saudi women and men behaving entirely differently when visiting Europe than they do in their daily lives in their own country.  And she tells of some of her own behaviors that would seem entirely appropriate to most of us -- such as walking across the street to her sister-in-law's home -- that were scandalous for a woman to do in Saudi Arabia.  Apparently, accepted practice was for a woman to be DRIVEN IN A CAR across the street, since to appear in public, even covered by a black abaya (aka chador, aka burkha), was immodest according to the Saudi's fanatically strict interpretation of Islam.  These guys are so afraid of women that it would be laughable if their treatment of women weren't so criminal.  And the older Saudi women are as bad as the men, forcing young women to adopt codes of behavior that reduce them to chattel property of the men in their families.<br /><br />And the author doesn't shy away from pointing out the role that money plays in Saudi society.  Like everywhere else in the world, when money talks, everybody walks, but the incredible wealth of the Bin Ladens sets them above the inhuman strictures of Saudi society so that they were -- and presumably still are --able to escape much of the oppression that afflicts those of more modest means.  One wonders how the poor survive in that society.<br /><br />The scariest part of the book for me -- and, trust me, there are many frightening parts -- is when the author characterizes Saudi women as pets, who are kept inside the home ALL OF THE TIME and expected to greet husbands and brothers with joy when the men deign to arrive at home and venture into the women's part of the house.  (Yeah -- women live among themselves in a sort of harem arrangement.)  And because they are inside all of the time, women are prone to vitamin defficiencies and other diseases brouht on by lack of fresh air, sunlight and exercise.  One is reminded of animals that are kept in tiny stalls their whole lifes and used only for breeding.<br /><br />This stuff is truly unbelieveable, which is probably why intelligent Western women continue to be suckered into marriages with guys like Yesalem bin Ladin, to whom the author was married for many years.  Who would actually think that a man who professes to love you could treat you in such a barbaric manner?<br /><br />Once it was clear to him that his wife was getting a divorce, Yesalem bin Ladin tried to forcibly take the author's children from Europe to Saudi Arabia, doubtless never to be seen again.  Then, when he failed to do that, Yesalem bin Ladin cut his children completely off, even refusing to speak to one of his daughters during a chance encounter on a European street.<br /><br />There is a lot of food for thought in this book, which can be read quickly but will stay with you for a long while after you finish.  The free nations of the world will do well to take seriously the challenges posed by societies such as that of Saudi Arabia.ALL OF THE TIME and expected to greet husbands and brothers with joy when the men deign to arrive at home and venture into the women's part of the house.

This story of a group of former Weather Underground members is set at various times in the 1960s, in 1996 and in 2006.  It traces the life of Jim Grant and his daughter, along with several people who are close to them, in Jim's past and in his present, and in our future.<br /><br />I don't want to give away the story and I recommend that those who have not read the book avoid reading reviews that reveal too much.  This book reads very well as a novel of suspense, so allow yourself to savor the details of the story as they unwind while you read.  It also works as a morality tale of a sort, as well as a meditation on the nature of one's political convictions and how they stack up in importance versus the welfare of one's family and friends.<br /><br />Right now in 2004, as we move through a deeply conflicted presidential election process, it's clear to me that we are not actually refighting the Viet Nam war, as some have said, but are rather re-arguing the two main moral positions associated with that war.  I am convinced that for those of us who experienced that war, whether at long or close emotional and physical range, it will always be at the bottom of our conscious choices.  It's not that we can't get past it; it's that the two basic oppositional points of view that were prevalent at the time have never been integrated into a consensual view of how to direct American foreign policy.<br /><br />Just as the politics of our parents, the so-called \\"greatest generation,\\" were always informed by their participation in WW II, so ours will always be informed by Viet Nam.  The difference is that our parents tended to share a single point of view of their wartime experience.  The vast majority believed that they had fought the good fight and that they had done it while on the side of morality and justice.  Those of us shaped by Viet Nam have no such assurance.<br /><br />All of this is to say that The Company You Keep brilliantly relfects the continuing political divisions among \\"boomers\\" (for lack of a better label).  It presents both points of view -- from those who supported the war and those who did not -- in what seems to me a sensitive way, and also poses some provocative questions about the sort of sacrifices one should be willing to make for one's moral values and one's family.<br /><br />This is one of the best novels I've read in a while and I highly recommend it to everyone, but most especially to those who took Viet Nam personally and sometimes feel its ghosts even today.he side of morality and justice.

The pacing is uneven, with some portions of the book dragging to the point where I began to long for something -- anything -- to happen.  And the motivations of the characters are, at best, murky.<br /><br />I forced myself to read 150 pages, just to be sure that I wasn't giving up too soon due to cultural barriers or some other fault on my part, but in the end I decided my modest amount of recreational reading time is just too precious to spend on Snow.	2004-08-27

Nevertheless, the authors do what so many others have done before them -- they take one or two really good ideas and then over-extend a discussion of them in order to fill a whole book.  While the ideas contained here are worthwhile, they could have been expressed just as well -- perhaps better -- in a feature-length article in the Harvard Business Review or similar publication.<br /><br />That said, I will acknowledge that there are a couple of chapters worth a careful reading, particularly those that discuss how one knows when to update one's \\"mental models\\", which is the term that the authors use for world view, or one's basic approach to life.  I also think that the final chapter, which focuses on current social and political issues, is very good.  Most of the book, however, can be abasorbed just by skimming through the pages.<br /><br />The authors do make some good points about how to relate to people who use different mental models, and they also shed light on what they call \\"adaptive disconnects\\" -- the techniques people use to integrate the conflicting views they hold in their own minds.<br /><br />For a more thorough and relevant discussion of how opposing views stem from differing mental models used by individuals, check out the writings of George Lakoff, a cognitive behavioralist who studies people's use of metaphors.  His book, Moral Politics, is must reading, especially if you are interested in the polarization of contemporary politics in the US.	2004-08-25

I found it helpful to read prior to purchasing property in P'town, as I had a lot of questions about the local economy and power structure that this book helped answer.<br />The text is deep, but not difficult, and the author's conclusions are based on evidence, rather than personal opinion.  I have seen several books in the last few years that bemoan the impacts of recent gentrification by gays and lesbians in P'town, but none of those were properly researched, nor were they in any sense objective.  This study goes much farther in presenting a balanced picture of a town that many of us love, but don't quite know what to make of its changing social landscape.	2004-07-14

I'm surprised that so many people have panned this book, since I enjoyed it very much.  Perhaps it's because I love the Outer Cape and always seek a regional book to read during the time that I vacation there each summer.  Thus, I enjoyed the background lore of the place that Maria Flook provides and, as another reviewer has noted, I was not troubled by the critical portrait of Christina Worthington, since her character rang quite true for me.  I live in NYC year-round and have met many young women of the type I believe Ms. Worthington to have been -- highly intelligent but directionless and self-abosrbed.  I didn't find Flook's characterization of Worthington so much negative as realistic.<br />Worthington's murder remains the talk of the Outer Cape, even several years after the fact, probably because humans dislike the unknown and most of us long to feel safe, which we can't so long as murderers remain at large among us.  As far as I know, no one has been arrested for the crime, although the father of Worthington's child seems to no longer be a suspect.  It's hard to imagine what sort of threat this befuddled woman presented to her killer, so I tend to go along with Flook's contention that this was a crime of passion, perhaps even committed on the spur of the moment.<br />In any case, Flook has thoroughly documented events leading up to the murder, as well as the subsequent investigation by small town law enforcement.  I found it to be an interesting study and encourage readers who like &quot;true crime&quot; books to check it out for themselves.	2004-07-14

Swerling's story is filled with interesting characters, some sympathetic and others appalling, but all of whom are captivating.<br />She tells the story of our great city through the lives, loves and adventures of several families whose members are surgeons (barbers), medical doctors (physics) or pharmacists (apothecaries).  That these families include African and African-American slaves is especially satisfying and I learned a great deal about the interactions between whites and blacks in the early days of our nation.  (Sadly, in some respects, not a lot has changed.)<br />I especially enjoyed the early chapters of the book that focus on the Dutch and the role of those settlers in forming the character of NYC -- many aspects of which endure today.  And if you live in the city as I do, you will probably also enjoy knowing where some of the key colonial landmarks were located and what has happened to them over the centuries.<br />In short, this is a highly entertaining book whether or not you are a New Yorker, as it offers an interesting plot line, believable characters and what seems to me a realistic window on life in colonial America.	2004-06-23

The heroine, Etna, is a powerful figure, but in the tradition of the period in which Shreve writes, Etna must keep her power undercover and hidden from her husband, a boorish professor at a local New England college.<br />The source of Etna's power -- perhaps the very power itself -- is her ability to hold a part of herself back from her husband and family.  She keeps secrets, both of fact and of feeling, so that her integrity as a person can't be breached by a husband who feels entitled to know and own her totally.  I identified deeply with Etna's need to do this, as I believe many women will who have been married to men who at first seemed innocuous but after a few years of marriage are revealed to be unbearably possessive.  In self defense, Etna must keep her true self contained and hidden from her husband's impulse toward emotional rape.<br />While that may sound a bit strong, it seems very legitimate to me.  I found the fact that Etna creates a personal studio space for herself -- and keeps it secret from her husband -- a natural response to his overwhelming intrusiveness.  It's a testament to Shreve's ability to finely draw her characters that a reader such as myself can so thoroughly identify with the heroine's emotions, as well as feel stifled by a fictional character such as the husband.<br />Overall, this is a very good novel with enough depth and action to entertain readers without being shallow.	2004-06-22

It's just that I thought it would be more fulfilling than it ultimately turned out to be, and that is, I believe, because it starts out so strongly and then sort of fizzles near the end.<br />Few books captivate so completly in the beginning, which this one surely does.  Who couldn't keep reading when the author has tempted us with a story of a dead, elderly and assumedly pious nun who is revealed to have a snake tatoo down the length of her body?  And this in the 15th century no less.  After that build up, I couldn't wait to read on and discover who applied the tatoo, and why.<br />But, alas and alack, the denouement is anti-climatic and, for me, disappointing.  This is not to say that I wouldn't recommend this novel, just that I thought it failed to follow through on its promise of being a decidely different read.	2004-06-01

Depending on my mood, it can be easier to read a page-turner or a book that offers a more action-oriented plot.  But The Archivist offers solid rewards for those readers who care to engage with the characters to uncover the gems of meaning contained in the story.<br />This novel reminded me of some other great works about madness, such as Sylvia Plath's The Bell Jar. The &quot;heroine&quot; Judith, if she can be called that, documents her descent into ever-deeper madness in her journal, which takes up the middle portion of the book.  I found this section highly compelling, as the journal entries have an inexorable quality that made me understand early on that there would be no redemption for Judith.<br />I also enjoyed the way Martha Cooley applies passages of T. S. Eliot to the lives of the main characters.  While I have always loved Eliot, reading Cooley's interpretation of his work deepened my appreciation for this great poet and led me to re-read The Waste Land, which I am doing now.<br />And near the end, when Matt comes to believe that he mishandled Judith and her mental illness, I found myself identifying with something quite unrelated from my own life, which tells me that the feelings Cooley describes are universal, and not tied only to her characters and their situations.<br />I'm struck by the level of sophistication and nuance that Cooley serves up in her first (and apparently, only) novel and hope that we see more entries from her in the near future.  While it is true, as another reviewer has observed, that this novel is likely to appeal to &quot;bookworms,&quot; I don't believe that we are the only critters who will find it worthwhile.  All serious thinkers, particularly those who are interested in Eliot, will enjoy this novel.	2004-04-29

Fanny is 10 years old when she comes to live with her mean-spirited relatives at Mansfield Park, and grows to womanhood in an environment full of condescension and personal challenge.  Her story, and her resulting triumph over prejudice and emotional greed, was an inspiration to women when it was written, and continues to be so today.<br />If you are not familiar with Jane Austen's work, don't be put off by the comments of others.  Start with one of her more well-known novels, such as Pride and Prejudice or Emma, and then work up to Mansfield Park after you've come to love Austen.<br />If you are one of those women who, like me, devoured Austen's more well-known novels and are now searching for the lesser known work, will enjoy Mansfield Park as well.  I give it five stars just for the simple fact that it was written by Austen, arguably one of the greatest writers in the English language, male or female.	2004-04-16

I have a contrarian point of view in that I think Shreve deliberately omits describing the internal moral struggles of her characters because they really don't experience much moral struggle.  I see them as being caught up in the powerful flow of emotion, of a love that they believe was destined to occur, and suspect that what drives other reviewers' antipathy toward this novel is not lack of character development, but the characters' lack of self-recrimination.<br />In any case, I rather enjoyed this book and, as a big Shreve fan, fancy that I can see the budding of her considerable talents in this early example of her work.  It is also a refreshing change to read about middle-aged characters who are coping with the effects of aging on their bodies, and the awkward feelings that arise when one engages in a romantic relationship at an age where physical beauty is on the wane.  These are challenging issues for many people that are not often addressed in popular fiction.<br />So while I do not recommend this novel without reservation, I do recommend it to those who have enjoyed the more sophisticated Shreve books and are now down to reading her earlier works while awaiting a new book from her.	2004-04-13

The language is very evocative of the beauty of west Cornwall, both in its fearsome and halcyon states.  The story line moves back and forth between the end of the 19th century and the end of the 20th century, detailing the married lives of Claira (1886) and Claire (1986), both of whom are artists:  Claira a musician and Claire a painter.  There are a great many themes of interest in the story, raising questions in the reader's mind about important moral issues, such as what constitutes piety, how a woman divides her time and obligation between her family and herself, and why some people do poorly in one relationship only to thrive in another.<br />There are highly joyful and profoundly sad moments that take place in this novel because Gabriel makes us truly care about her characters, especially, for me, Claira, the 19th century woman.  And there is also a good deal of interesting information intertwined in the story -- about art, nature and the customs of people and a culture that matter very much, even if they existed before we were born.  In the end, Gabriel seems to be saying, it all comes down to \\"what remains\\" after we're gone.  In other words, as the song goes, \\"the fundamental things apply as time goes by.\\"<br />Given that sentiment, I found this to be a hopeful novel -- no small thing in this time of war and trouble.  And there's a delightful surprise at the book's end too, one that makes me realize life is always full of surprises -- and sometimes they're good!	2004-04-07

After all, it's written by a fellow Brooklynite and it's about topics I enjoy: psychic powers and female bonding.  But, ultimately, I found this book only mildly satisfying, mostly because the action just isn't believeable, even for a story about the supernatural.  The novel has some good points, which is why I give it three stars, but it certainly promises far more than it delivers.  If you are interested in the interpersonal dynamics among young people, and also enjoy an element of mystery in your novels, try instead The Secret History by Donna Tart, which is a truly first-rate novel and far surpasses this pedestrian effort from Libba Bray.	2004-04-07

Most of the action takes place in a quiet seacoast town in Maine, moving back and forth between the 1980s, when the novel's two principle characters -- a mother and daughter -- were young, and the present day, when the daughter is a widow in her twenties.  Mother and daughter have never communicated with one another very well and Martin gradually allows the reader to discover why by letting each of the women tell her side of the story, switching between narratives and points of view.<br />While the daughter does end up learning the identity of her biological father, that is not her true quest in this novel.  Rather, she is searching for the *meaning* of what took place in her childhood, not merely trying to uncover the facts.  I always enjoy stories where the author gives me tidbits of a story and I have to use my wit and intuition to figure out what really happened, pulling information from the narratives of the main characters to find objective reality beneath the characters' subjective experiences.  This is one of those books, and I quite enjoyed unraveling the mystery as I savored Martin's beautiful prose.  I highly recommend this book for readers who appreciate a good story, well told.	2004-04-04

The central premise -- that the universe is a common creation of humans projecting our ideas and mental images -- is not as startling as it first seems once Talbot explains the basis for his theory.  And the really intriguing thing is that the concept draws nearly as heavily from spiritual traditions as it does from scientific principles.<br />For years I have struggled to bring together my intuitive spiritual convictions with my analytical turn of mind and basic common sense.  This book goes a long way toward helping me integrate those various approaches to knowledge, without forcing me to discount or deny one or another frame of reference.  I highly recommend this and other books by Michael Talbot to anyone who is curious, and open-minded, about the nature of reality.	2004-03-30

I teach a graduate course in marketing for nonprofit organizations and am always on the lookout for a good text that covers key issues without including complex material that the  general manager doesn't really need to know (e.g., Fishbein formula, etc.).  This book comes close, although it does have limitations for U.S. students because some of the chapters refer to systems and structures that exist only in the U.K.  However, that can also be a plus, providing a perspective that is a bit more globally focused than many of the texts by U.S. publishers.<br />While this book provides a solid grounding in the basics, I found that I still needed supplemental materials in order to provide students will the full picture of nonprofit marketing, specifically readings and case studies about social marketing, on which this book is rather light.  An good companion volume is Marketing the Public Sector, by Seymour Fine, which is (sadly) out of print, but worth tracking down.  The conscientious instructor will need to do some customized updating of the Fine book, since by now it is quite old and much has changed.  Nevertheless, it is a useful resource, for which I have not been able to find an adequate replacement.<br />One asset of the Sargeant book is its price, which is considerably less than the standard text used in nonprofit marketing courses -- Alan Andreason's Marketing in Nonprofit Organizations.  In good conscience, I just can't require my students to puchase a text that costs $120., especially since many of them are working for modest salaries in charitable organizations.  On the whole, the Sargeant book is one of the best I've found for providing a sound overview of nonprofit marketing concepts at a reasonable price.	2004-03-29

And also because I believe that the author is sincere and wishes to share his views on an important topic with others who are interested in spirituality.  In the end, however, Novak's assertions just don't ring true.  Try as I may, I can't accept the idea that we have two souls, never mind the even more oddball ideas this book contains.<br />Novak would probably say that I'm simply in denial about the so-called \\"binary soul doctrine\\" because it's scary, which indeed it is.  Seems to me, though, that he is trying to preempt criticism by branding challengers as self-serving cowards before they have a chance to question his analysis.  Many of his assertions are pretty far fetched, particularly in regards to passages from the Gnostic gospels and other well-known ancient texts.  I have done a fair bit of reading in this area and certainly resist the idea that things are quite as black and white as Novak appears to believe.  And his interpretations of the modern seers like Edgar Cacye also leave me wondering how closely he has actually studied Cayce's readings, as opposed to merely scanning them for potential evidence to back up his theory.<br />One thing I like about Novak's approach is his outright caution to readers early in the book to beware of New Age charlatans, of which I've learned there are a gracious plenty.  He is right to encourage readers to think for themselves and not merely accept the conventional interpretations of scripture and related texts just because someone with a post-graduate degree has proffered them.  In that spirit, I encourage people to read Novak's books and decide for themselves whether or not his theories are convincing.  As for me, I've given his ideas a fair reading and doubt that I'll be saving this book as part of my permanent collection.<br />I advise those who are interested in reading more credible books on the after-death experience to try Michael Newton's Journey of Souls and Robert Grant's A Place We Call Home.

I concluded this after reading tons of books on Cayce, as well as his readings, which are transcriptions of things he said while in trance.  If you're a seeker, it's important that you read what he actually said, rather than just reading what others say about him and how others interpret his philosophy.  What convinced me that Cayce is legitimate were his own words.  In the beginning, he himself was not convinced that his knowledge came from a higher source.  In fact, he thought it may have been evil, or at the least just a personal fantasy his brain pumped out while he was in some sort of stupor.  Only after he saw that his readings helped real people deal with real problems did Cayce become comfortable enough with his abilities to use them without significant reservations.<br />This little book on auras, or halos as some might call them, is one of the few publications from A.R.E. (Cayce's foundation) that Cayce actually wrote himself.  Most of the other books, while interesting and valuable, were written by Cayce's followers, most of whom at this point in time never knew Cayce personally.  There are a lot of interesting ideas in this booklet and I recommend it to those of you who are on a journey to find reliable sources of information on the nature of what Cayce called \\"the unseen world.\\"<br />A.R.E. also publishes the unedited transcripts of all of Cayce's original readings -- on CD-ROM and in print -- and for serious seekers I recommend those as well.	2004-03-24

This novel is neither, although it does contain a mystery of sorts.  The question surrounds the identity and interactions between several historical figures in three different time periods -- the fall of Rome, the time of the Black Death in Europe and the fall of France during the Second World War.<br />The story contains many references to philosophy and religion, comparing characteristics among the three time periods and the people who lived through each.  A key idea of the book is the question of personal choice during times of trouble.  Does one hold fast to absolute principles, risking death and destruction, or is it better to go along with the opposition in hopes of ameliorating its brutality?<br />In the three cases described in the novel, the opposition is represented by the barbarians who sacked Rome, the oppressive Church of the Dark Ages and the invading Germans of 1942.  In the first two instances, the heroes allow themselves to be co-opted by a barbarian king and the Church hierarchy, with mixed results.  In the final instance, the hero teeters on the brink of choice, finally deciding to stick with his principles, even though in doing so he, his friends and his way of life are certain to be destroyed.<br />The book is exceptionally thought-provoking.  I spent a lot of time thinking about what I read, going back and re-reading sections, and pondering what I might do in a similar situation.  A bonus was that I learned a good deal about the Greek philosophers and about what life was like during times and in places that I don't know much about.  This is a very good read that will challenge most readers and, in return, pay off in ways that the usual page-turners do not.	2004-03-16

It's more than a love story, although it is indeed that. It's not quite science fiction, nor is it a fantasy, although there are elements of both those genres in this novel.  And it's not traditional fiction, although that may be the closest thing to it overall.  In the end, it seems to me that this story is a musing on life -- what is it really, and can love overcome the death that we will all experience?  And if it can, how does it work, and does it work for everyone, or only for those who truly manage to see beyond their own concerns to those of the beloved?<br />For me, this book raised a lot of philosophical questions -- about destiny and fate, about love and memory, about living in the moment rather than the past or future.  And it's a lovely story in the bargain.  Buy it, read it, and don't let niggling questions of rationality or logistics discourage you so that you stop reading before the novel hooks you, which may not happen until you're well into it.<br />This is a truly great read, highly recommended.	2004-03-08

But the other draw was the primary setting for most of the action, which is a large cemetery in a neighborhood of well-to-do middle class homes. I have always enjoyed cemeteries (so long as I'm not mourning someone who is buried there) as interesting vehicles for gaining an understanding of social history and for feeling my humanness.  Some tombstone incriptions amaze me with their heartfelt honesty, and because the emotions expressed are so congruent with my own -- even when the person in question died decades ago.  It makes me realize that there really isn't much difference between us in the end.  And that is, I believe, the main appeal of this novel.  All things happen in the fullness of time -- the tragic, the beloved, and the blessed.  And the core substance of life doesn't really change much from era to era.<br />I also enjoyed reading about the sexual byplay between the adult women characters, their husbands and the other men they meet.  While some of the action seems to be \\"typically\\" Victorian, other scenes are surprising for the time.  For instance, there are actually incidents of spouse swapping (most certainly called \\"wife swapping\\" at the time), which surprised me given that I have come to think of the Victorians as sexual prudes.  And, of course, there is the obligatory punishment for the woman (Kitty Coleman) who steps out of the traditional role to grab a moment of joy for herself.<br />Also alluring are the characterizations of the daughters -- Lavinia, who seems true to the spirit of the era and is, in other words, the sort of Victorian lady who faints and fumes and, generally, portrays herself as the fair flower of womanhood; her younger sister Ivy May, who is quiet and the \\"nice girl\\" who finishes last in the end (literally); and Maude, the girl who is too smart for her time and also ends up paying a price.  And, while Maude and Ivy May pay obvious prices, the cost to Lavinia of languishing in her socially accpetable role is also quite high.  The three girls challenge readers -- female readers anyway -- to place themselves in their shoes and think about the choices that we would make, given the social constraints and rewards of the time.<br />Overall, this is a thought provoking book that encourages the reader to reflect on her/his humanity and the ways that all of us are connected, now and forever.up paying a price.

It's Earth-time 2037 and suddenly, for a few small groups of people, there is a huge upheaval in time, with the result being that people from all segments of Earth's history are thrown together in a crazy quilt patchwork made up of different time periods.  Early hominids find themselves captured by 19th Century English colonialists in India.  Space travelers splash down to learn that they're in 13th Century Afghanistan.  The armies of Alexander the Great and Ghengis Khan, separated in original Earth time by four centuries, come face to face in a bloody and brutal war instigated by one of the astronauts from 2037, who has a sort of \\"Man Who Would Be King\\" complex.  Ultimately, one of the \\"good guys,\\" a woman with a UN peacekeeping force from 2037, makes it back home to her own time, but only at the price of losing her 19th Century lover, who remains stranded in ancient Babylon.<br />While it may sound confusing, this cleverly imagined novel is all you would expect of the great Arthur C. Clarke and his writing partner, the brilliant hard sci-fi master, Stephen Baxter.  By the time I got to the last page -- which was not very long after I started this book -- I was wishing I had waited until the next volume was out so that I could go on reading and immediately find out what had happened to my favorite characters.  And the bonus is that, in addition to an intriguing plot and lots of interesting historical factoids and science tidbits, this novel raises some provocative questions about the human soul and our destiny among the stars.  Altogether, an excellent top-of-the-line sci-fi read that will probably become a classic.<br />So why haven't I given it 5 stars?  Well, the novel itself deserves 5 stars.  This edition of the book gets only 4 stars, however, because the publishers, who included what looks like a good CD-ROM in the book, chose to use an e-book format that can only be downloaded onto a handheld running the Windows operating system.  Those of us who prefer Palm OS are out of luck, unable to access two bonus novels and interviews with the authors.  What a chintzy decision, especially for a novel by authors of the stature of Clarke and Baxter.ose to use an e-book format that can only be downloaded onto a handheld running the Windows operating system.

Dick	Books	4	12	14	N	N	Entertaining Collection	While this is a reissue of an earlier publication, this story collection is an excellent first book for those new to Philip K. Dick, as I was.  In his forward to this edition, Dick writes that good science fiction must offer the reader a truly new idea and \\"it must be intellectually stimulating to the reader; it must invade his [or her] mind and wake it up to the possibility of something  [s]he had not up to then thought of.\\"  (The brackets are mine.)<br />If we accept Dick's definition of good sci-fi, then this is truly good.  The collection contains no stories that are \\"bad,\\" and many that are outstanding.  My favorites include \\"The Skull,\\" the \\"Infinites,\\" \\"The Variable Man,\\" and \\"Beyond Lies the Wub.\\"<br />If you don't yet own a story collection of Dick's, this one would be a good place to start.	2004-01-28

Very funny and irreverant, shallow but not silly.  Perfect for the airplane trip and for the beach at the end of the flight.  I laughed out loud while reading, which doesn't often happen.	2003-11-24
