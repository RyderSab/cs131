The author clearly does not attempt to distance herself from the subject, but she lets us see all (including the darker) sides of his personality. It is not written in the usual dry biographical style, but I think that her style fits the subject.	2005-08-05

I would have given 4 stars but there are not nearly enough illustrations. Something critical in an art history book. He often referred to works which I'm not familair with and were not illustrated. I found this to be very frustrating.	2005-06-08

Forget the drug stuff, this book has passages that should be studied in every creative writing class. The  book has also aged very well. I first read it about 20 years ago and recently reread it.

This book meets none of these criteria. The characters are boring self-absorbed people who have stereotyped problems and the author clearly dislikes them.	2005-04-16

She obviously deeply respects the people who she spent time with in Greenland. However, as she barely hints at, there are problems under the surface with alcoholism dysfunctional families and sexual abuse. By glossing over the darker side of things and portraying the Innuit as \\"noble savages\\" she provides us with a one dimensional portrait of thier way of life.	2005-04-13

But when I finished the book I still had the feeling that I didn't really understand the inner man.  <br />It's interesting to note how an author can cause you to feel sympathy for a man who ordered the deaths of tens of thousands of people and who ethnically cleansed Judea of Jews even going so far as to change the name of the country. If he were alive today he would be condemed as a muderous dictator. <br />Overall, I think that Robert Graves did it better.	2005-04-02

However, the book had many awkward passages that I had to read 2 or 3 times to understand what he was trying to say. When I read Faulkner there were also passgaes that I had to re-read. However, when I re-read Faulkner I thought to myself how clever and complex the passage was. When I reread the passages in this book I thought to myself how needlessly confusing.  <br />I've already learned to stay away from Booker prize winners because the winning books are judged more in terms of their political correctness than literary merit. I hope the Pulitzer isn't going down the same path.	2005-03-19

I had the following problems with the book: <br />1) Editing - It could easily have been 25% shorter, in addition several stories are repeated. I've seen this often in famous authors. I guess either their books are not edited at all, or the editor is afraid to do his job. <br />2) The translation--There are sentences that do not make sense. I read them over several times, and they are just poorly written. <br />3) Maybe the book shouldn't have been translated. There's quite a bit of Colombian politics whic probably strikes a chord among South Americans, but I was lost. <br />4) I got the feeling several times that he was writing the book to thank people who had helped him get his start, which slowed down the pace of the book	2005-02-27

Here we have a number of characters and situations that contribute nothing to the development of the plot. <br />4) It's preachy. I'm in complete agreement with her about the dangers of agribusiness but I don't need to be hit over the head with it. The CEO of Global Pork Rind reminds me of Mr. Burns from the Simpsons. <br />5) She couldn't decide if she was writing a satire, a novel, or a polemic. <br />I should have stayed away when I saw that the only favorable review they could find for the back cover was from People magazine.	2004-12-11

On the bad side we have too much of the author's personal life. He comes off as an insecure, immature, neurotic, spoiled rich kid. By the end of the book, I really didn't like him. <br />It's also interesting to note the author's appaling ignorance. He is a graduate of a highly rated college, and his lack of knowledge, especially about history and religon, surprised me.	2004-12-04
