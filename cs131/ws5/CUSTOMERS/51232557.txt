It also teeters right on the edge of the stuff that seems driven by an urge to discourage potential competition from entering the field.  Plus it doesn't have any valuable info on penciling!!!  Mitch Byrd's \\"Notes to Draw From\\" is a better resource.<br /><br />Klaus Janson has worked on some major DC titles and apparently also teaches at the School of Visual Arts.  Here he seems to be trying to pad out grudgingly little info on penciling with a sort of \\"why comics require super skills to draw\\" pedagogy that consumes more than 110 pages of an essentially 142-page book!<br /><br />There's some good info in here I suppose, but the technical stuff always needs to be taken with a large block of salt.  No one ever became a great artist by studying art.  People become great artists by doing what they enjoy!  The way to become an artist is by creating art.  As you encounter challenges you look for solutions to problems and develop.  In that sense this book might be useful.  B-S- statements like \\"Drawing... requires study\\" etc etc do more harm than good IMHO.<br /><br />The most important thing for would-be comics artists to remember is that the most successful guys in the field are Matt Groening and Scott Adams.  They didn't get to the top through their knowledge of anatomy!  Frank Cho is a brilliant draughtsman, but \\"Liberty Meadows\\" will never have the kind of circ \\"Doonesbury\\" had - back when Garry Trudeau was drawing little better than stick figures!<br /><br />There are lots of books written from a viewpoint of encouraging young artists to learn while supporting them through their inevitable frustrations.  Look for those books before wasting your time with this.	2005-09-30

Although beautifully written, readers should be forewarned that the text contains only incidental references to the bloody fighting, which is described in more detail in Masefield's later \\"The Battle of the Somme\\" (Heinemann, 1919.)<br /><br />Masefield says of the old front line \\"It is a difficult thing to describe without monotony, for it varies so little.\\"  You will enjoy this book if you enjoy elegiac prose. His tone is subdued but nevertheless he is celebrating the heroism of the British forces: not surprising since Masefield was writing at the behest of Charles Masterman, the head of Britain's War Propaganda Bureau, for whom he was working by 1917.<br /><br />John Masefield was an author and poet laureate of Great Britain, most famous for his poetry collection \\"Salt Water Ballads.\\"  He was 37 when he joined the Red Cross to serve in France during World War I. Masefield went on the Dardanelles expedition with an ambulance unit and witnessed Britain's disastrous Gallipoli campaign on the Turkish coast. When he returned to England, Masefield was recruited by Masterman and produced a number of texts and lectures putting a positive face on the challenges faced by British troops in the war.<br /><br />The battle of the Somme began July 1st, 1916 and produced over a million casualties.  Masefield declares \\"It first gave the enemy the knowledge that he was beaten.\\" However he is exaggerating, since the result was merely a strategic withdrawal of the German forces to a better fortified line (the Siegfried Stellung) from which they launched their final offensive two years later.  Masefield makes much of the German's superior position, but it should be borne in mind that they were subjected to the most massive artillery barrage of the war, taken by surprise, and vastly outnumbered.  Anyone interested in a fuller account of the battle should try a more recent text on the Western Front or for  personal memoirs of the battle try Siegfried Sassoon's \\"Memoirs of an Infantry Officer\\"  or Robert Graves' \\"Goodbye to All That.\\"tle should try a more recent text on the Western Front or for  personal memoirs of the battle try Siegfried Sassoon's \\"Memoirs of an Infantry Officer\\"  or Robert Graves' \\"Goodbye to All That.\\"	2005-06-28

Furthermore the EC stories, including the sci-fi thriller \\"Food For Thought\\" (from INCREDIBLE SCIENCE FICTION #32, 1955), are reprinted elsewhere - samples would have sufficed, and certainly the text-referenced splash panel from \\"Homesick\\" should have been included - not everyone can go look it up!<br /><br />Note that the \\"Williamson\\" illustration for vol 1 #5 of VENUS is quite plainly at least inked by Krenkel, although not attributed to him.	2005-05-25

This material originally appeared in black and white and apparently Wood's wife Tatjana colorized it.  Although the coloring is mostly fine, she appears to have worried about nudity and painted one-piece bathing suits onto female figures!  It's not QUITE the equivalent of painting pants on the Sistine Chapel figures - but only because this is not some of Wallace Wood's best work! A few pages are simply oversized text or blown-up sketches.  Another irritation is the publisher's reminders of the material we missed by not buying the deluxe edition (the 'picto-fiction' version of the story, available in its entirety in \\"Woodwork\\" and partially sprinkled through this edition to pad out the volume!!!)<br /><br />\\"Wally\\" Wood was one of the greatest comic-book artists of the 20th century, standing directly alongside greats Jack Kirby and Will Eisner.  Famed for his amazingly detailed sci-fi work, particularly for EC comics, Wood also created some marvelous heroic fantasy for the Marvel and Warren lines.  Frustrated by low pay and corporate-art strictures Wood created the \\"pro-zine\\" Witzend in 1966.  A predecessor of `adult' comix like HEAVY METAL, the magazine published experimental and controversial material, including the stories collected here.<br /><br />Wood recognized the popularity of Tolkien-esque fantasy and \\"The Wizard King\\" was intended to be an irreverent take on the genre, with anti-heroic characters and ironic plot twists.  Unfortunately there's a lot of repetition and the story never even quite meets the standard set by his stories in the mainstream Marvel title, \\"Tower of Shadows.\\"  Wood's fantasies for EERIE and CREEPY are much better - the influence of writer Archie Goodwin is missing here.	2005-05-25

Who is H&eacute;lene?  Who was La Globule?  Is Moraine the murderer?  What is their connection with the late jewel thief, Jo Tour Eiffel? Burma's mentor, Montbrison, has only dead ends and red herrings to offer the detective as he follows the twisted trail leading to 120 Rue de la Gare.<br /><br />This is a highly enjoyable hard-boiled mystery with a lot of twists and turns.  The `casting call' finale is a bit clich&eacute;d, and the story as a whole somewhat text heavy, but Tardi pulls it off as always with splendid characterization and period detail.  Highly recommended!	2005-05-06

Beginning with \\"Adieu Brindavoine\\" in 1972 Tardi depicts a world combining Jules Verne with Emile Zola.<br /><br />This 5th album of the Adele Blanc-Sec series revives the plucky French journalist last seen in the bizarre adventure \\"Momies en Folie\\" (This is the original, untranslated French version.)<br /><br />The former Edwardian photographer Brindavoine is now a miserable conscript in the trenches of WWI. During a bombardment he stumbles across a talking statue, actually a kind of wireless set for the psychic powers of Adele's retired mummy! The mummy is trying to direct Brindavoine to Adele, lost in suspended animation in the laboratory of a dead scientist. Unfortunately rescue will have to wait as Brindavoine is badly wounded. Meanwhile Brindavoine's former boss, American millionaire Otto Lindberg, joins forces with the Mafia in a plot to take over the world.<br /><br />I thought this was marginally better than the preceding album but not nearly as good as the first two.  Sadly, the simplistic view of WWI and the cliched capitalist conspiracy are too humorlessly treated to be viewed as satire.  However Tardi's marvellous attention to period detail is always fun to see.	2005-05-06

Space-time agents Val&eacute;rian and Laureline land secretly in Syrte, the capital, and discover that it is dominated by a mysterious priesthood, les Connaisseurs (the Sages), who hate earthmen.  After a series of hairs-breadth escapes our heroes meet the leadership of the merchants guild, who have been plotting a rebellion to overthrow the Sages' oppressive rule.  In the course of the rebellion Val&eacute;rian pursues the Sages to their base planet and learns their secret.

Originally appearing in 1975, space-time agents Val&eacute;rian and Laureline escort 28th century-Earth's ambassador to Central Point, a sprawling ancient `space station' which functions as a sort of informal intergalactic parliament.<br /><br />It is Earth's turn to chair the assembly but the ambassador reveals Galaxity's secret plan - to sieze control of the corrupt and disorganized complex!  No sooner has he arrived, however, than he is kidnapped and Val&eacute;rian is captured when he goes to the rescue.  Laureline is left with a protocol officer and an alien creature which can replicate anything fed to it.  The Shingouz, corrupt alien informants who reappear throughout the series, provide information that helps Laureline find the missing pair - but Central Point has a secret that undermines Galaxity's plans!<br /><br />Several tropes that recur throughout the series are displayed here.  Galaxity, like humanity in general, has many failings: contrary to its benign self-opinion it is imperialistic and prone to a corrupt `real-politik.'  Natural simplicity is superior to technological superiority;  the evolution of advanced beings leads to psychic powers without need of mechinality. Laureline succeeds by breaking the rules, and as a woman can manipulate males sexually without being manipulated herself.<br /><br />Childhood friends Pierre Christin (story) and Jean-Claude M&eacute;zi&egrave;res (art) created the science fiction saga which debuted in 1967 in the French comic magazine \\"Pilote.\\"	2005-05-02

This 1978 story, episode 8 of the long-running French comic strip \\"Val&eacute;rian, agent spatio-temporel,\\" is one of the four which have been translated into English.<br /><br />Val&eacute;rian and Laureline patrol time and space to maintain the security of Galaxity, capital of the 28th century Terran empire.  In addition to parodying superheroes, the other contestants symbolically represent different socio-political ideals, with the Norse Irmgraal representing the warrior mystique, the Slavic Ortzog representing totalitarian communism, and the mystic Blimflim representing a kind of new-age totalitarianism.  Val&eacute;rian, dutifully representing the Terran time/space authority, seems overmatched by these domineering supermen - but the battle is not always to the strong, nor the woman to the warrior!<br /><br />It's a fun story with a well-paced and tightly-plotted script and M&eacute;zi&egrave;res' mature art and excellent panel breakdowns.  As in much of Christin's work the political symbolism is straightforward, not to say heavy-handed, and the story's liberal moral is very clear!<br /><br />The series' two main characters are defined in liberal-feminist terms: Val&eacute;rian, the `good man', is well-intentioned but muscle-headed, and thoughtless about where he hangs his pants.  Laureline displays a winning combination of impulsive humanism and cynical shrewdness when faced with challenges, which she overcomes with far less difficulty than Val&eacute;rian.<br /><br />Jean-Claude M&eacute;zi&egrave;res' artwork is similar to the work of Jack Davis, a pleasingly solid display of brisk brushstrokes depicting slightly stylized forms.  M&eacute;zi&egrave;res' panel breakdowns are excellent and his ability to express mood and emotion has developed steadily.

Time-travelling into medieval France in the first adventure, \\"Les mauvais rêves,\\" Val&eacute;rian rescues a spunky young redhead named Laureline, who returns with him to the future to become his partner.<br /><br />Laureline is affected by a powerful psychic disturbance as the pair approach the Terran colony Alfolol.  It turns out that the planet is the homeworld of a spacefaring race who periodically leave and return to it.  The colonial authorities' efforts to integrate the non-technological natives soon breaks down, and when they are confined to a sterile reservation Laureline rebels.  In the end she and Val&eacute;rian take the Alfololians to Earth, where presumably their presence will be so disruptive that more effective accommodations will have to be reached.<br /><br />From the beginning of the series Val&eacute;rian requires Laureline's help to succeed; she is the dominant character in \\"Ambassador of Shadows.\\"  Here she essentially declares her independence, representing the imperative of the conscience while Val&eacute;rian is something of an apologist for Galaxity's technocratic bureaucracy.<br /><br />Initially \\"Val&eacute;rian\\" featured a number of clich&eacute;s (a character modeled on Jerry Lewis appears in \\"Terre en flammes\\"!!!)  The first villain, Xiombul, is a straightforward evil genius.  After \\"Les Oiseaux du maître,\\" however, conflict in the series typically springs from misunderstandings or ideological differences that can be resolved through reason and perserverance.

The beautiful illustrations of the former are essentially colorized contemporary photographs and are intended to depict uniforms as worn, rather than standard issue.  This is wonderful for the military modeller or figure painter, but it is insufficient for serious uniform research since there are no tables of insignia or specific depictions of patches. It is a general overview of the clothing, equipment, and firearms of a representative selection of soldiers and guerrillas.<br /><br />The WWII section presents 3 numbered figures per page in national groups, chronologically by year from the invasion of Poland in 1939 to the end of the war in 1945.  This is followed by illustrations of a selection of weapons and gear.  The numbered figures are then indexed to captions.  The second section of the book, illustrated by Mike Chappell, begins with uniforms of the Korean war and covers the cold war and \\"wars of national liberation\\" up to the late 1970's.<br /><br />The separate illustrations of gear and weapons are limited and somewhat eclectic.  The author makes educated guesses when describing the equipment of the figures but isn't always correct (the weapon carried by the Viet Cong is a K-50, not an AK-47!)<br /><br />All in all this is a valuable reference for a visual artist rather than for the serious researcher.	2005-03-21

Under no circumstances buy the work of Hoffman unless you are fully equipped with the work of Frank Frazetta.  The price differential between this collection of mostly black and white pencil studies and the stunning pen and ink, watercolor, and oil work of Frazetta is insignificant compared to the vastness of the talent differential!<br /><br />Hoffman captures Frazetta's anatomy (including the occasional mistakes!) without capturing the spirit of the work - but it's more than that.  Frazetta himself was influenced by other artists, including Al Capp.  Some of Frazetta's equipment and vehicles have a silver-age corniness to them.  Hoffman's weapons, terrain, even monsters! - are cheesy fill-ins - just enough to act as props for his bare-naked ladies.<br /><br />After seeing Frazetta, I found it hard to accept even 'imitators' like Jeff Jones, Boris Vallejo, Barry Winsor-Smith et al.  However those artists may have started with Frazetta - but they found their own way forward.  Once you've exhausted their work, and classic illustrators like Allen St John, Virgil Finlay, and Joseph Clement Coll, try Hoffman - for contrast!	2005-02-22

It is yet another politically-correct attempt to diminish the importance of Whites in the abolitionist movement and present Blacks as the only real authors of their liberation.  The book describes White abolitionists as childish old maids whose sentiments are fueled by the desire to draw cheap Black labor up from the South.  These silly and ignorant people are educated, with difficulty, by stern and courageous Blacks who observe White pretensions with a knowing sense of humor.<br />The book begins with a lurid depiction of the heroine, the proud and beautiful Mercer, in stereotypically helpless sexual bondage to her male slavemaster.  All Whites in the novel are stereotypes or ciphers.  After using prurience as a hook to get the novel underway the author later criticizes White abolitionists for objectifying her heroine!  Likewise, after asserting that Whites are meanly stereotyping Blacks, the author uses stereotypes to ridicule 19th century White religious women.  After presenting Whites as consistently venal, ignorant, and prejudiced the author has her heroine address the question of why there are bad Blacks:  It is all the fault of slavery, Mercer solemnly explains.  This comes after the author has ridiculed humorous depictions of Black dialect in contemporary popular culture and characterized it as rascist, but then, apparently realizing that her uneducated Southern heroine speaks idiomatically perfect English, Mercer begins prefacing her orotund speeches with a few y'alls.<br />I can't help but feel amazed that this biased nonsense has been favorably reviewed, let alone selected as 'Philadelphia's One Book.'  Nevertheless from a deeply cynical perspective it may indeed be unintentionally representative of the city's self-idea.  The book is worth examining as an example of unconsciously racist discourse intended to benefit its presenters by working an ethnic political bloc with tales of their victimization and unappreciated superiority.

Guilty not of acts but of expression, his death at government hands might be just another sad addition to the crimes of totalitarianism - except that Brasillach was a RIGHT-winger, condemned and executed by the post-liberation French authorities.  Brasillach was among many accused collaborationists (or suspected conservatives) who were 'purged' following the liberation of France, often by leftists with old scores to settle.  There are two important issues this affair raises for me:  what regard for justice can we expect in a passionate time, and why do people embrace extreme views?  These are not Kaplan's concern.  She wants us to consider the profound question:  why can't people whose views I hate just keep their damn mouths shut?<br />Brasillach neither served the Germans in any official capacity nor participated in any war crimes.  Nevertheless Kaplan claims that Brasillach is guilty, although hedging that his punishment was excessive.  She accuses Brasillach of three crimes:  denouncing French citizens to an enemy of France (punishable by death under a 1944 revision to article 84 of the French penal code), treason (article 75), and calling for the death of French politicians.  The accusations never get off the ground.<br />While it is fair to denounce Brasillach's anti-semitism and hostility to democracy, Kaplan presents no proof that he denounced fellow citizens personally, except for politicians already imprisoned by the Vichy government.  There are serious legal and even ethical problems in condemning a man for sympathizing with foreign agents whose authority is sanctioned by his own government.  The closest Kaplan comes to a justification of Brasillach's legal guilt is when she quotes the damning remark (left out of Brasillach's compiled works!!!):  \\"One was asked to point out the Jews.\\"  Kaplan, who expends several pages in interpreting the quote as meanly collaborationist, says \\"It is a fudge, a syllable away from a confession that he did...\\"  Perhaps just a bit more than a syllable: a verb, a personal pronoun or two, maybe a conjunction...<br />Kaplan's aggressively prejudicial interpretations are the body of the work, together with some irrelevant detail about contemporary events.  Her argument is simple:  Fascists are bad, so what they do is bad.  If a Fascist goes for a walk, he walks in a bad way.  Brasillach wrote several books; one was nominated for the Prix Goncourt, France's highest literary award.  Kaplan says they were all bad books, so THERE!!!<br />The valueless childishness of this sort of thinking seems self-evident to me.  The 20th century political arena showcased an endless parade of troupes of righteous zealots, all convinced that they had identified the Bad Guys responsible for humanity's woes, all shouting down any questioning voices, each exiting the world stage disgraced by odious crimes - to become the bad guys of the NEXT troupe!<br />The job of the thinking man is to gong this crap, without falling into the trap of ideological despair.  We need to blame crime, not opinion, and if we disagree with opinion we need to present a case that is not based on ad hominem attacks on our opponent's character!

I know many Canadians, and am delighted to say that they need a caste of &quot;artists&quot; to provide them with dreams the way a fish needs a bicycle.  As for the story...<br />The narrator actually presents us with two stories, neither of which is especially convincing.  In one, a young man and his mother are trapped on a lifeboat with a cannibal cook, the last a survival expert whose amazing knife (it MUST be a Ginsu!) is capable of both dressing meat and chopping off heads.  After the cook has for no particular reason created a raft out of oars and chopped off the mother's head, the plucky lad wrests the cook's knife away and slowly chops him to bits.  The other story is invested with a good deal more versimilitude - up to a point.  In THAT story, the young man must manage a powerful but unpredictable being who can be palliated, but never entirely tamed, through offerings.  However that story also contains blatantly unbelievable nonsense.  &quot;Which story,&quot; we are asked, &quot;Do you prefer?&quot;  Well neither, but I'm an agnostic...<br />I found the author's point to be heavy-handed and rather naive.  In addition there is a good deal of misplaced humour in the book - I won't say it isn't amusing, but Mr. Martel might have been better advised to keep the Mutt and Jeff routines and ditch the religious speculation.<br />The book does raise one worthwhile question, but I think the book itself is the answer to it.  Should government 'arts' bureaucracies create and support a separate caste of &quot;artists&quot;, or should artists be ordinary citizens, discovering art through participation in real life?  More real life would have helped this book.  Citizens should support, not their artists, but their art.  Those who rely on others' imaginations live worthless lives, and realize crude dreams.s book.

Vol. 2 (Spanish Civil War)	Books	4	2	2	N	Y	A good story that needs more definition	I've always enjoyed the work of Vittorio Giardino, the best contemporary practitioner of the &quot;Belgian style&quot; of comix illustration.  His stories are almost always tales of intrigue, mostly starring Max Bergman, an agent of the French &quot;Deuxieme Bureau.&quot;<br />In this series Max is working on his own, searching for a an old comrade-in-arms, now an officer in Spain's Republican Army, who has disappeared in the Spanish Civil War after falling into disfavor with the Republican secret police.<br />Max travels to the front with a beautiful young French correspondant and other, more cynical members of the press corps.  We see the devastation of the war and get a feel for the political undercurrents swirling around the Republican cause.<br />Unfortunately, like the previous book this is not really a complete episode by itself, and ends without a clear climax.  The subject matter is fascinating, the characterization and attention to historical detail are excellent, but the plotting is weak and the story is simply a kind of picaresque ramble through the war.	2003-08-27

This is a manifesto calling for a new conception of humanity's place in the universe.  If that sounds pretty grand, well, this book appeared in the sixties...  The French authors, columnist Louis Pauwels and physicist Jacques Bergier, feel that \\"Cartesian reason does not cover the whole of man or the whole of his knowledge\\" and are calling for an optimistic, mystical philosophy of modernism that they call Fantastic Realism.<br />This is one of my favorite books, and is the progenitor for most of the \\"New Age\\" literature that was to appear decades later, from the 1970's through the '90's.  The authors (Pauwels, really) assert that homo sapiens is not a mechanistic clock-work operating within the limits of Nature, but is instead on a journey of progressive evolution towards cosmic interconnectedness.  A key assertion is that it is possible to understand the most complex aspects of reality through an expanded state of awareness, without plodding through the limited and sometimes inaccurate scientific method.<br />The book presents a great deal of esoterica, which often obfuscates the authors' intention, which is to call for \\"Reason ... pushed to extreme limits ... operating on a higher level, linking up with the mysteries of the mind and spirit, the secrets of energy and universal harmony.\\"<br />It's easy to confuse this book with compilations of the occult or unexplained, like \\"Arthur C. Clarke's Mysterious World\\" or \\"Ripley's Believe It Or Not\\".  Actually, like Colin Wilson's \\"The Occult\\", \\"Le Matin des Magiciens\\" is speculatively considering such ideas with the aim of inspiring the reader to question reductionist theories of reality.  The book is non-clerical but spiritual call to embrace modernism, and all the possibilities it represents, rather than reject it.	2003-06-06

This novel (entirely in Spanish) is by the original author, H&eacute;ctor Germ&aacute;n Oesterheld.  There are also a few illustrations which I believe are by Francisco Solano L&oacute;pez, the original artist and illustrator.<br />The story is about an alien invasion of Buenos Aires set around 1962 (the story first appeared in 1957.)  Oesterheld and L&oacute;pez had hoped that the story would be a pilot episode for a continuing series, but this never developed.  There is also an alternative version, authored by Oesterheld with illustrations by Alberto Breccia.  However Oesterheld continued the story in text form, which comprises the bulk of this book.<br />Two later comic-book sequels appeared, one by Oesterheld himself, but they are not highly regarded.<br />Oesterheld 'disappeared' in 1976: it is assumed he was executed as a presumed foe of the military dictatorship of the period.	2003-02-26

Comix fans will be aware that along with fellow artists Gilbert Shelton, Robert Crumb and Trina Robbins, \\"Spain\\" was a key figure in the 'underground comix' revolution of the late '60's.  Less unconventional than his colleagues, his work has a more 'standard' radical political perspective on social issues, and celebrates macho violence and righteous conflict.<br />This collection of about a dozen stories begins with a series of loosely-related pieces describing Spain's youthful, late '50's experience as a motorcycle gang member, followed by two mid-'80's strips about his experience at the Democratic Convention protests in 1968, and a fictionalized account of his then-girlfriend's journalistic investigation of the Iran-Contra affair in 1986.  This is followed by an unrelated series of propagandistic historical vignettes celebrating radicalism.  The most interesting pieces are a Robert Crumb-inspired self-examination and the final strip, in which Spain discusses his artistic inspiration.	2002-03-15

The 25 illustrations Nielsen provided for Gudrun Thorne-Thomen's 1914 fairy tale collection, &quot;East of the Sun and West of the Moon&quot;, are considered to be his best work; 19 of those illustrations are included here.<br />The first world war came as a serious interruption to Nielsen's career and he turned to theater design before returning to book illustration in 1924. 11 plates represent his later work illustrating Hans Christian Anderson and the brothers Grimm.<br />It should be noted that none of the samples of Nielsen's work presented here overlap with those published in Larkin's overview of 'Golden Age' illustration, &quot;The Fantastic Kingdom&quot;.	2001-02-01

That book, together with &quot;East of the Sun and West of the Moon&quot;, represent Nielsen's most popular work.<br />Originally Nielsen was strongly influenced by Aubrey Beardsley and Harry Clark, and combined strong line work with bold watercolor.  However in later life his work became much more painterly, relying much less on line work and using a more subdued palette.<br />With the Great Depression, the golden age of illustrated books ended and Nielsen had great difficulty making a living as an illustrator.  A proposed collaboration with Walt Disney fell through and Nielsen lived in poverty in a house provided by friends until his death in 1957.<br />In the last years of his life Nielsen painted a set of illustrations for a proposed edition of the 1001 nights, but was unsuccessful in interesting a publisher.  He gave the watercolors to his friends, the Monhoffs, who approached Peacock Press with the illustrations after the positive reception of Bantom editor David Larkin's 1975 fairy-tale art collection &quot;The Fantastic Kingdom&quot; which included examples of Nielsen's early work.  Larkin arranged to have the 1001 nights illustrations printed as the 41 color plates in this 1977 trade paperback.<br />Readers familiar with the Nielsen illustrations presented in &quot;The Fantastic Kingdom&quot; may find these works disappointing, as they represent Nielsen's later period of flat patterns inspired by 1930's-era social realists.....	2001-02-01

In book I we met the seductive  Chihuahua Pearl, her paramour ex- confederate Colonel Trevor, and the cruel  Mexican Governor Lopez in a clever and complicated plot and counterplot as  at least 4 seperate groups battled for the cash.  In book II the story of  the gold concludes, leaving Blueberry in the brutal Francisville military  prison. The second half of the book is titled &quot;The Outlaw&quot;: in it  Blueberry escapes prison only to wind up in a presidential assassination  plot.<br />Tightly plotted with action that never flags, these stories,  written in 1970-72, are arguably the best of the series.	2000-04-12

The essay has been mostly well  translated into English (with an occasional awkward construction) by Mary  Hottinger.<br />The Hyperotomachia is the lengthy and rather bizarre  dream-narrative of 'Polipholio's search for union with his beloved, the  maiden Polia.  Similar to the late medieval narrative &quot;The Romance of  the Rose&quot; (but far longer) the Hypnerotomachia is understood to be a  mystical allegory and has been interpreted and reinterpreted since its 16th  century publication.  A complete English translation by Jocelyn Godwin has  recently been issued and is available elsewhere at  Amazon.com.<br />Fierz-David interprets the story as a combination of  psychology and alchemy.  The narrator is presented as searching for his  'anima', Jung's much-celebrated idea of the feminine shadow of the male  psyche, and progresses through a series of revelations and initiations in  order to do so.<br />The actual Hyperotomachia is very long and composed  largely of detailed architectural fantasies.  Fierz-David effectively  abridges and glosses this mass.  Regardless of your view of Jungian  psychology this is a valuable overview of an otherwise not  easily-accessible Renaissance classic.	2000-02-28

Sprague De Camp, a REH fan who had access to the estate of Howard's literary agent. De Camp 'completed'  several Conan stories from outlines found after Howard's 1936 suicide.  2  of the stories included (&quot;The Hall of the Dead&quot; and &quot;The  Hand of Nergal&quot;)  are 'completed' stories; they are fair pastiches of  other REH adventures.  Another 2 stories are by De Camp and fantasist Lin  Carter (&quot;The Thing in the Crypt&quot; and &quot;The City of  Skulls&quot;.) I thought them pretty poor.<br />The original Howard tales,  however, are superb stories and amoung the best of the Conan cycle.  They  are:<br />&quot;The Tower of the Elephant&quot;, in which Conan follows a  master thief into a mighty wizard's abode, and unleashes a supernatural  revenge;<br />&quot;The God in the Bowl&quot;, in which Conan burgles a museum  and uncovers a supernatural revenge;<br />&quot;Rogues in the House&quot; is  a clever combination of violence and intrigue as Conan is hired to  assassinate a powerful priest;<br />And first and least, &quot;The Hyborian  Age&quot;, Howard's introduction to his hero's period and environment.	2000-02-10

The original paperback edition had cover art by Frank Frazetta.  The book contains 4 stories:<br />People of the Black Circle (REH)<br />The  Slithering Shadow (REH)<br />The Drums of Tombalku (DeCamp, REH)<br />The Pool of  the Black One (REH)<br />Robert Ervin Howard (1906-1936) created the premiere  sword-and-sorcery character Conan the barbarian for the pulp magazine  &quot;Weird Tales&quot; in the early 1930's.  L. Sprague De Camp, an  academic and literary fantasist, edited the stories for re-publication in  the 1960's.  He also obtained outlines for never-completed Conan tales from  Howard's literary agent, Glenn Lord, and used them to produce pastiches in  the Howard manner.  &quot;The Drums of Tombalku&quot; is one of these  stories; although REH is listed as co-author the story is really assembled  from such adventures as &quot;Jewels of Gwahlur&quot; and &quot;The  Slithering Shadow&quot;.  Oddly Conan plays an incidental role; it is  Almuric the Aquilonian adventurer who discovers the lost, decaying city of  a dying race who are preyed upon by a supernatural monster, and rescues the  damsel in distress.  Conan is tacked on at the end in a bit of mercenary  intrigue that appears to be included only to give him a role in the story -  as a fairy Godfather?<br />Of the real Howard stories, &quot;People of the  Black Circle&quot; is the best, a neat mixture of sorcery, intrigue and  action.  &quot;The Slithering Shadow&quot; is a formulaic lost-city-  decayed-race- monster-threatens-the-ingenue story, and &quot;Pool of the  Black One&quot; is only a minor variation on the theme.	2000-02-07

This book should still be an acceptable read for Bellairs fans, though.<br />Irascible Professor Childermass wants to  help lonely Johnny Dixon get a summer job, and donates a collection of  occult antiques to a local museum to achieve it.  Little does he suspect  (despite quite a lot of experience!) that these items are the tools a  power-mad wizard can use to conquer the world.  Johnny is helped by his new  friend Sarah as he once again conquers his timidities in order to save the  world.<br />As usual Strickland has settled on a pastiche of previous Bellairs  books, largely drawing on &quot;The Dark Secret of Weatherend&quot; and  &quot;The Secret of the Underground Room&quot;.  He also introduces a  rather colourless new character, an ersatz Rose Rita Porringer named Sarah  Channing.  What's still lacking is Bellairs feel for pacing and imagination  in combining occult horror with the more mundane fears and dramas of  childhood.	2000-01-19

The book is a mix of  amateur pop psychology, ecumenical syncretism of the Joseph Campbell  variety, and a heavy dose of '80's-era political-correctness.  Together  with Sam Keen's &quot;A Fire in the Belly&quot; it was one of the bibles of  the short-lived 'Men's Movement' of the early '90's.<br />A 'new' male model  emerged in the '70's; 'sensitive guys', who painfully discovered that male  sensitivity is not valued in this (or indeed any) culture, by either men OR  women.  The traditional male, confident, dominating and aggressive,  continues to be the desired ideal.  Why do so many men come down with  sensitivity, and what can be done about it?<br />According to Bly, in halcyon  days of yore boys were initiated into the true nature of manhood either  deliberately by cultural rites or incidentally by working alongside their  fathers. He blames the industrial revolution for causing a disconnection  (&quot;Iron John&quot; contains a great deal of digressive social criticism  and liberal finger-wagging) and asserts that modern men are now raised by  women without the necessary immediacy of bonding with older males.  The  book is full of symbolism and poetry conveying a bleak picture of male  emotional wounds.<br />Bly touches on issues many men obviously find  important, but he offers no real solutions beyond the vaguely-sketched  initiation process that emerges from his discursive interpretation of the  title fairy tale.  All men are victims in his view, especially those who  think they aren't!  He is fearful of offending feminists and tries to  placate their presumed disapproval by qualifying his call for wildness with  obsequious proclamations of allegience to feminist theory.  He expends a  good deal of blame on traditional conservative targets, and new-agers are  also targets for scorn.  If you find victimization theory attractive this  book may have something to offer,  but it's a view not exactly symbolic of  strength and empowerment.a  good deal of blame on traditional conservative targets, and new-agers are  also targets for scorn.

All I'm saying is, don't fall for it!<br />This book describes two revivalists who, if James Randi's assertions are to be believed, do appear to be swindlers.  However the other individuals attacked in the book are evangelists who either to all appearances honestly believe in faith-based healing or who, at worst, enhance religious fervor with showmanship!  This attempted guilt-by-association, together with ad-hominem attacks and sweeping religious bigotry, should make an open-minded reader skeptical of the honesty of any of Randi's assertions.  No actual proof of dishonesty is provided by Randi, only his own claims.<br />Extensive medical research supports the idea that faith has a powerful role in healing.  This is not necessarily religious faith; the placebo effect, a long-established medical principle, demonstrates that faith in medicaments can have a profound effect on alleviating suffering.  However there is no honest reason to deny that religious faith can have equally beneficial effects.<br />The real intent of this book is to ridicule religious believers, not expose con men.  Randi reveals his bias explicitly; stating at one point  \\"They [Christians] don't seem to think at all.\\"  Randi, as a zealous adherent of the religion of Atheism, is deriding other faiths as deluded by their beliefs.  An honest examination of faith-based healing would have to investigate the enterprises of non-sectarian exponents such as Bernie Siegel, Patch Adams, and many other medical figures claiming health benefits from belief and attitude.

Paramhansa Yogananda (born Mukunda Lal Ghosh) was a devout Hindu and founder of the Self-Realization Fellowship, a society devoted to Kriya Yoga, a form of meditation.  This autobiography was originally published in  1946 and immediately became a spiritual bestseller.  Full of mystic wonders  and miracles it is told with a sincere faith - but there is more than one  way to interpret the events related!<br />Ghosh was born in very comfortable  circumstances; his father was an executive in the Bengal-Nagpur Railway.  According to Yogananda he demonstrated his spiritual superiorities at an  early age - during spats with his sister!  Unconscious sibling and parental  rivalries recur throughout the book.  Upon the death of his mother, Ghosh  obtained a pension (by fraud!) and made his way through a parade of saints  and wonderworkers to the ashram (seminary) of Yukteswar Giri (Priya Nath  Karar).  The future Yogananda was mercilessly ridiculed by his fellow  chelas (students) as well as the acerbic guru. At one point he watches in  mystification as Yukteswar 'predicts' the theft of a cauliflower from  Ghosh's belongings.  To Yogananda's continuing puzzlement Yukteswar's  psychic abilities proved insufficient when faced with more mundane missing  items...  Later Yukteswar becomes besotted with a young chela Yogananda  describes as handsome but worthless - ignoring the more deserving Ghosh!  Eventually the chela over-abuses his indulged position and the  broken-hearted guru turns to Ghosh with tears in his eyes, saying: &quot;I  will leave it to you to instruct Kumar to leave the ashram tomorrow; I  can't do it!&quot;  Then Yukteswar's mother visits the ashram: Yogananda  observes that she is &quot;a woman of very decided opinions.&quot;  Later  she scolds her son:<br />&quot;Sri Yukteswar backed away without further  argument... I was touched at his great respect for his mother even in her  unreasonable moods... There was a charm about the trifling incident; it  supplied a sidelight on my guru's unusual nature, inwardly humble and  outwardly unbendable.&quot;<br />Yogananda's life was replete with miracles,  and I can't resist mentioning two more: on one occasion, he had to give a  speech, but was worried that his English wasn't good enough; afterwards his  friends said the speech was just fine!  On another occasion it was  predicted that he would someday like strawberries and behold!  By mashing  them with lots of sugar they became quite tasty!<br />Yoganada's story is also  leavened by outspoken Indian nationalism and occasional Moslem-bashing.  Nevertheless he comes across as sincere and likable.  A fascinating tale!ed a sidelight on my guru's unusual nature, inwardly humble and  outwardly unbendable.&quot;<br />Yogananda's life was replete with miracles,  and I can't resist mentioning two more: on one occasion, he had to give a  speech, but was worried that his English wasn't good enough; afterwards his  friends said the speech was just fine!

Gilbert Shelton, who started out drawing 'Wonder Warthog' for Harvey Kurtzman's &quot;Help!&quot; magazine, went on to create the quintessential '60's comic-book characters, the Fabulous Furry Freak Brothers.  Struggling  with the classic issues of hippiedom the Freaks evaded law and order,  survived bouts of money and drug shortages, and managed to keep their funky  s--t together until the late '70's.<br />In this ludicrous misadventure the  Freaks attempt to take a flight abroad in a time of airline deregulation.  Accidentally split up they become embroiled in a military/terrorist plot to  take over the world.  Fat Freddy winds up with an atom bomb, Phineas  becomes head of his own cash religion and in the end the trio save the  world in spite of themselves!  A wonderful finale to a great comic.	1999-10-14

Psychics, ESP, Unicorns, and Other Delusions	Books	3	17	56	N	N	A book which is itself a kind of 'flim-flam'	James Randi is a zealot of the religion of Scientific-Materialism.  Like all religions, SM seeks to define reality and howit operates; its assumption is that all phenomena are both observable and testable, and it is characterized by an exaggerated faith in the methods of natural science and the conclusions of (some) scientists. Scientific-Materialists are not skeptics - they have a deep and profound faith and examine alternative philosophies not as possibly true but as heresies against modernism.<br /> Randi has made his name in the SM community in the '70's, claiming that all psychic phenomena are fake.  This book, written in 1980, is his claim to be Grand Inquisitor of the SM organization, the Committee to Scientifically Investigate Claims Of the Paranormal (CSICOP, pronounced 'psy-cop'.)<br />Unfortunately for Randi he has learned an expensive and time-consuming lesson: simply being able to demonstrate an alternative explanation for phenomena is not the same as PROVING a psychic claim to be fake.  Randi's fanatical assertions that the psychic abilities claimed by some people (Uri Geller for one) were 'fake' was challenged in court in the mid-80's.  Randi lost, as any honest scientist could have predicted - without using psychic powers!<br /> As the other reviews indicate, this book will be treated as holy writ by believers in SM, as an entertaining sideshow by the open-minded, and as repugnant by believers in the philosophies Randi scorns.	1999-10-14

Martin McGartland was a small-time criminal in Belfast's Catholic ghetto when he was approached by agents of the Royal Ulster Constabulary's 'Special Branch' (roughly equivalent to our FBI) and turned into a double  agent inside the IRA.  While the story is gripping I found it hard to be  especially sympathetic to McGartland, who basically sells out the IRA  because he doesn't care for their anti-crime efforts!<br />McGartland's bland  story of his recruitment as a double agent doesn't quite ring true for me;  undoubtedly the R.U.C. had plenty of criminal evidence against him.  As he  is now in a British witness protection program we may assume a certain  degree of self-interest in his demonization of his one-time 'comrades'!  Nevertheless the gritty depiction of life in Catholic Belfast and  McGartland's escapades as a double agent (especially his arrest by the IRA)  make absorbing reading.	1999-10-14

Although well researched and presenting some uncomfortable truths  there is a good deal of mean-spiritedness in the depiction of the  characters and a lot of unnecessary ugliness.<br /> Robinson presents us with  the doomed pilots of Hornet Squadron, a collection of largely inexperienced  soldiers sent to war with what the author considers misguided tactical  training.  One of the book's main points is that British losses were  heavier, and German losses lighter, than the British claimed at the time.  Pilots are lost long before the squadron sees any action, however, and a  good deal of stress is laid on the personal shortcomings of the airmen.  An  American veteran of the Spanish Civil War joins the squadron, and the  author makes some points about military class-consciousness A La &quot;The  Revolt of Gunner Asch&quot; (oh, it exists in other armies? What a  surprise!)<br /> The BBC TV version was quite faithful to the book.  I found  both to be a little too unpleasant for my own taste.	1999-10-13

I got a BIG kick out of this book which, I suppose, is indeed intended to be social commentary of some kind.  Whether you buy into that angle or not it's an engrossing thriller about a lost generation, a group of people  drifting completely without any moral anchor and the inevitable results.

This is not a super-patriotic book; on the other hand it IS heavy in detail and there are just a few too many plotlines, IMHO.  If you have the patience to skim  through a bit of technical jargon, however, this is a great action  novel!<br />The facts behind this story are these: in the late '80's Colombian  druglord Pablo Escobar blew up a plane with 3 American nationals aboard.  He wasn't interested in them but in a Columbian who had crossed him!  George Bush responded by creating a secret unit of Colombian commandos  dedicated to taking out the druglords.  Despite many casualties Escobar was  finally cornered on the roof of his Bogata mansion and riddled with  assault-rifle bullets.  The squad went on to mop up the Medellin and Cali  drug cartels - but of course, new narco-trafficers simply stepped in!<br />  Clancy gives us a fictional version with perhaps a few too many reasons to  consider military intervention, and his commandos are U.S. Army Rangers,  using satellite uplinks to call in laser-guided missile strikes - this is  definitely a novel for techno-freaks!  CIA agent Ryan's (almost)  single-handed rescue of the survivors, and a U.S. Secretary of State flying  down to hobnob with a rogue Cuban Colonel, are a bit hard to swallow;  still, this is a ripping yarn!	1999-09-24

The story is a collection of the strip which ran as a two-page serial in  the British weekly comic book &quot;Eagle&quot;.  Frank Hampson wrote and  pencilled most of the strips as head of a creative team which later  included '60's comix great Frank Bellamy.<br />  Previously Dan and his  friends, having defeated the Mekon and brought peace to Venus, are enlisted  by the mysterious alien spaceman Lero in an attempt to save his doomed  race, the Crypts.  In this volume Dan, Digby, Flamer and Lex aid the  peaceful Crypts in resisting the genocidal Phants, and discover the secret  of the endless cycle of interplanetary war.<br />  Conceptually the story  is imaginative but plot inconsistencies are glaring; faster-than- light  travel, a key element of the previous story,  is denied in this story.  Names are not very imaginative; the Crypt spaceship intended to save a  remnant of their civilization is the 'Kra', the evil Phant heirophants are  'Kruels', etc.  Two- fisted British pluck, together with a bit of muddling  through, wins the day.  Nevertheless the series was a seminal one for  British comix and introduced sci-fi concepts which were to become staples  in series such as 'Dr. Who' and 'Star Trek'.	1999-09-17

This 5\\" x 8\\" Dover paperback reprints 35 short fantasies by Edward J.M.D. Plunkett, 18th Baron Dunsany, together with 20 illustrations by his fantastic illustrator, Sidney Sime.  The collection includes such wonderful ironic masterpieces as \\"The Exiles Club,\\" \\"The Hoard of the Gibbelins,\\" \\"The Sign,\\" and \\"The Secret of the Gods.\\"<br />Lord Dunsany was an original fantasist who created his own cycle of gods and legends between 1904 and 1916.  The stories are mostly short Arabian-Nights style fantasies suffused with an elegant irony that strongly influenced U.S. horror writer H.P. Lovecraft.  Also included are 6 of Dunsany's later (post-1920) stories of the incorrigible barfly, Jorkens.<br />Born in Ireland in 1878, Dunsany was actually a professional soldier who served in the Boer War and WWI.  He is caricatured briefly in Olivia Manning's \\"The Balkans Trilogy,\\" where he appears as the dyspepsic guest Byron professor at the University of Athens.  Dunsany devoted much of his later life to hunting and died in 1957.  His written work is a surprising counterpoint to his biographical life, and he is frequently associated with the turn-of-the-century Irish Revival movement along with Yeats and Synge.<br />Sidney H. Sime (1867-1942) was an ink-and-wash illustrator working in a turn-of-the-century style comparable to Edmund Dulac or Charles Robinson, but without their color palettes.  The extensive range of grays used for his pictures are well reproduced in my edition.<br />I have to add that the back of the book jacket claims that it is \\"A Dover edition designed for years of use\\" : I purchased my copy in 1978, and the binding almost immediately detached!	1999-09-17

Artist Frank Hampson drew the two-page strip for most  of the magazine's run.<br />  'The Man From Nowhere' is the first half of  a two-book cycle in which Earth is contacted by an alien civilization - Dan  Dare's fame having spread throughout the galaxy!  It had not spread so far  as the episode's villians however...  The second part of the story is told  in 'Rogue Planet'.  The story is not, however, the first appearance of  &quot;Dan Dare&quot; in Eagle.<br />  Despite a number of logical  incongruities in the story and action grounded in a style of two-fisted  manliness now viewed as rather campy this constant-cliffhanger tale is  highly entertaining.  Frank Hampson's artwork is superb.<br />  There are  at least two versions of the story, the first being a 3 book series  published by Roger Dean's 'Dragon's Dream Publishing' in 1975.  Hawk Books,  another British concern, published the stories as part of a complete  collection of Dan Dare strips in the '80's.	1999-09-16

Sinetar throws in a few exercises for figuring WHAT you really love, but the basic idea is that  old, old observation that you are likelier to be successful if you are  working in a field you care about than if you are just punching a  timecard.<br />'Likelier to be' is not, however, a word that comes easily to  Sinetar and some folks will find the blind optimism of 'The Money Will  Follow' a bit hard to swallow.  Needless to say 'Trust in Allah but tie up  your camel' is an adage always to be borne in mind when following this sort  of advice, and everyone knows people who've done what they've loved and the  money never appeared, let alone followed.  It's to challenge this kind of  pessimism that Sinetar has written her book, and she makes an engaging  cheerleader.<br />There are lots of similar works and personally I think  Napoleon Hill presents a better case, but Sinetar is a bit more up to date.  Worth reading as an adjunct to other job-search books (like 'What Color is  My Parachute'.)	1999-07-27

Next Corto sails into the Amazon as little more than a  witness to the decline of a hallucinatory deserter from the trenches of  WWI.  In the next story Levi, the South American curiousities dealer,  enlists Corto in a mission to rescue the enslaved son of a wealthy South  American doctor. In the final story Corto arrives in Venice on the trail of  a map to El Dorado. He becomes involved in a murderous plot involving the  devious Venexia Stevenson, who was thought dead in 'Banana  Conga'.<br />Although full of Pratt's fascinating characters and geographical  detail I thought the first two stories were rather weak, and the moral of  the third a bit too blatant.

Unbeknownst to DiFool and almost everyone else, the caste of technocrats who run the advanced but decayed civilization are preparing an intergalactic coup using the power of the Dark Incal to create mysterious shadow eggs.  Captured by the Technos in part one of the volume, DiFool's difficulties have scarcely begun, as crime-queen Tanatah has blackmailed super-assassin the Metabaron into tracking him down.<br /><br />This 62-page trade paperback, volume 1 of Epic Comics' presentation of the Incal saga, originally appeared in French and is apparently considered one of the great triumphs of Euro-comix.  Written by famed director and scriptwriter Jodorowsky, it's ably translated into English by the Lofficiers, and the art is of course by the wonderful Jean \\"Moebius\\" Giraud at the height of his powers.  It's a lot of fun, with its sleazy and self-preservationist hero struggling to avoid coming to grips with the destiny explained to him by his concrete parrot, who becomes enlightened after swallowing the power artefact.<br /><br />Unfortunately the '80s-era story becomes increasingly heavy-handed in the next volume as the New Age ideas of both artist and writer begin deploying.  With the exception of DiFool and Deepo characterization never amounts to much, and the plot devices turn into cloying cliches.  Although you've got Giraud's outstanding artwork, I'd recommend other works by the artist, such as \\"[[ASIN:3936480680 Arzach]]\\" or even his New Age epic The Aedena Cycle ([[ASIN:290503520X Starwatcher (Aedena Edition)]]) over this.w Age epic The Aedena Cycle ([[ASIN:290503520X Starwatcher (Aedena Edition)]]) over this.	1999-06-30

'Angel Claw' is a jumble of  alternately sexy or morbid images 'connected' by a story written by  Alexandro Jodorowsky, Moebius' collaborator on the disappointing 'Incal'  series.<br />I can't give Moebius less than 3 stars, but this was another  disappointment.	1999-06-30

The girls are dropped off in Nantucket where they are to be under the  'care' of Coffin's sister, auntie Tribulation. Tribulation does indeed  appear as Nantucket turns out to harbour anti - British-monarchy terrorists  and the wicked Miss Slighcarp, villainess of 'The Wolves of Willoughby  Chase'. The fast-paced, intricately- plotted story comes to a very clever  ending.<br />As usual Joan Aiken is brilliantly spoofing 19th century  literature.  Adults will find the parody hilarious while children thrill to  the melodrama.	1999-06-10

Of course it's really just for  children...<br />The redoubtable Dido Twite returns from her adventures in the  Atlantic to reunite with Simon (now a Duke) in London, where she finds that  once again her nefarious musician father is up to his eyebrows in  'Hanoverian' plots against the Stuart throne.  The tale is crammed with  incident as Dido and Simon fight the machinations of Abednego Twite and his  patron, the evil Margrave Eisengrim.  The appearant foundling Is, who (in  the next novel) proves to be the daughter of Dido's unhappy sister  Penelope, is also introduced.<br />All Aiken's adventures contain dark edges  and disturbing images but in previous novels they were counterbalanced by a  more inventive goodness and optimism - although it has to be admitted that  'The Wolves of Willoughby Chase' was a pretty tough cookie for a juvenile  adventure.  With 'Dido and Pa' the series has become somewhat stale and the  characters more routine - though still superior to most of Aiken's  competition.  Perhaps as a result the Dickensian environment of cruelty and  misery becomes more oppressive, which together with the 'just desserts'  experienced by the villians makes the novel grim reading for the grade  school set.	1999-06-10

The  nefarious efforts of 'Hanoverians' to unseat the Stuarts is the engine  which propels the plots of this and the next 3 novels.<br />Simon, the  artistic gooseboy in TWoWC, is the hero of this novel, which introduces  Dido Twite, who goes on to star in the next two novels; 'Nightbirds on  Nantucket' and 'Dido and Pa'.	1999-06-10

Presumably this is the last, though I won't say why!  The title is perhaps a TAD confusing: Is is the name of the foster-sister  of the redoubtable Dido, the latter the star of the superb novel  'Nightbirds on Nantucket'.  'Is Underground' is a LOT darker than the  previous novels and takes the theme of child labour, which runs through all  Aiken's juvenile novels, to an extreme.<br />Is returns to London following  the adventures of the previous novel ('Dido and Pa'?) to discover that the  city is almost devoid of children - a mysterious pied piper has lured them  north to the secessionist county ruled by the mysterious &quot;Gold  Kingy&quot;.  The heir to the throne has disappeared in an attempt to solve  the riddle and Is is sent on a mission by the ailing king himself to  unravel the mystery.  She finds a secret railway, an underground city and a  horrible policy of cruelty to children that is surprisingly inventive,  given the variety of English ideas on the subject from 'Chitty Chitty  Bang-Bang' to Dahl's 'The Witches'.<br />All in all a good deal darker and a  great deal less humourous than the preceding stories.	1999-06-09

Ironically the title, picked from Yeats'  poem, 'The Second Coming', was intended to suggest that hippiedom was the  coming paradigm; in reality Didion completed her essay shortly before the  'death of the hippie'. She did no real investigating and so never saw the  beatnik connection: the hippies were both a continuation of Beat philosophy  and a human overload that collapsed the fragile community that had  developed in the area in the early '60's. The irony is compounded by  another essay in the collection in which she revisits her childhood town -  Sacramento, California's state capital. Didion never mentions it but the  Governor was at the time a certain fellow named Ronald Reagan! A Hollywood  politician, beneath the notice of such as our journalistic Joan. Well, at  least someone WAS slouching toward Bethlehem...<br />  Didion affects a  kind of cool, ironic detachment but like Tom Wolfe, another of the formerly  'new' journalists, there is an underlying disdain of her subjects intended  to exalt her judgement at their expense. Ultimately she comes across as a  small soul in a large and incomprehensible world.	1999-06-08

Hayden saw it  come together and watched it fall apart, but while the summer soldiers came  and went he applied himself to practical politics and is today a California  State Senator.<br />Hayden's story is sad in many ways and he offers trenchant  criticisms of the unreality of much of the radicals politics, and some  re-thinking of positions described in his 'Port Huron Statement' and  'Trial'.	1999-06-03

The real time of gifts is the time you spend reading this book! Fermor decided to celebrate his mid-'30's college graduation by hiking from Amsterdam to Constantinople. His curiousity and affability, combined with  snowballing introductions to families in the region where he travelled AND  a well-informed yet Romantic idea of the regions' histories, gives this  marvellous novel the feel of a fantasy quest through history and place.  Fermor sleeps in haystacks and baronial halls, dines with gypsies and  aristocrats, and is taught history by counts and cowherds as he crosses  frontier after frontier in the indian summer of prewar Europe. The  marvellously rich story continues with 'Between the Woods and the  Water'.<br />It was interesting to me to discover, accidentally as there is  only the vaguest of references to it in the book, that Fermor was the hero  of a wild commando escapade in WWII Crete.  Together with another British  commando and a team of Greek resistance fighters Fermor kidnapped the Nazi  commanding general for Crete and extracted him to England!

I strongly sympathized with a lot of the things the author was saying, which seemed just as true then in terms of broad philosophical  concerns.<br />The book is really kind of picaresque, though, and is mostly  about the author's days wandering around the Columbia campus during the  'student unrest' of spring 1968. It seems to me now to be an accurate  picture of the state of mind (and ego!) an adolescent caught up in the  excitement of a hopeful ferment. 20 years later the radicalism looks pretty  absurd, and the naivite of a handful of ivory-tower revolutionaries  believing that they would somehow remake the country in the face of popular  disapproval (Oh yes!) and a complete lack of long range plans and goals, is  laughable. Still, there is a lot of crie du couer here, mixed together with  teenage truculence.<br />  Kunen was 19 when he wrote the book which would  make him 50 now. He was recently a reporter for TIME magazine, and wrote a  '97 article that can be looked up at the TIME website about the children of  the radicals. He also wrote a follow-up to The Strawberry Statement which I  THINK was a TIME article, in '88 I think.<br />If you find the subject  interesting I would strongly recommend RADS by Tom Bates about '60's  radicalism in action at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.<br />'One of  these days I may fight in earnest and altogether so that I won't have to  fight any more.'<br />Maybe.

The later books downplay the hallucinogenic aspect and present a  sort of fantastic mystic existentialism.<br />de Mille and his contributors  assert that the accounts are fabulations.  Other accounts of Yaqui  shamanism are quite different. Environmental conditions and animal  behaviour described are inconsistent with existing conditions in the  Sonoran desert. Yaqui use of hallucinogens is asserted to differ from that  described by Castaneda.  Finally, some critics suggest that the author is a  poor stylist.<br />de Mille discusses Castaneda's academic milieu and possible  influences upon the spiritual ideas he presents.

As usual Pratt  creates compelling minor characters playing out tragic roles on a vast  canvas of historical events.  The villainous Cossack ataman Semenov is  superb, although in fact Pratt was obviously unaware that the real man was  more eastern-European than Oriental in appearance.

By 1968 he was a homeless psychedelic swami with string of arrest warrants and a trail of discarded wives, friends and fans stretching across the east coast.  How he got from point A to point Z is the sadly funny part of this rather Rabelaisian, sometimes savage, and frequently frustrating memoir.<br /><br />Kleps has a disarmingly engaging writing style but the story has several shortcomings.  The author is too impatient (and too opinionated!) to hold back conclusions he would like the reader to believe he arrived at after 4 years of painful experience and shrewd observation.  He doesn't trust the reader to draw conclusions for himself in what should unfold as a developing revelation of enlightenment and self-confidant conviction.  Kleps never saw a digression he didn't like and dogmatically propounds his 'religious' beliefs at every opportunity.  However Kleps and his mordant wit, expended on every available target, enlivens the narrative immensely. Bitterness, alas, too often gets the better of him and he rants in '70's-radical style against 'the establishment'.  These moments, however, provide the reader a certain degree of unintentional humour when contrasted to Kleps belief system, a Shirley Maclaine-style 'you create your own reality' philosophy which is applied more to metaphoric interpretations of random events than to his own real-life setbacks!<br /><br />Kleps is at his best when describing the follies of the time with self-deprecating humour.  He entertainingly describes founding the 'Neo-American Church', essentially a legal dodge to permit drug experimentation and raise funds to support him in a style to which Timothy Leary had become accustomed.  Alas it never quite comes off for reasons that baffle Kleps but which the attentive reader may ascribe to the author's adolescent delight in provocative remarks, self-righteous mooching, and condescending arrogance.  Some of this is eye-poppingly funny, however, as when he relates in some detail his beliefs about the genetic inferiority of African-Americans, propounded to a barful of blacks while on an acid high!<br /><br />Kleps belief is essentially that the universe is meaningful and everything we observe can be deciphered to our benefit since we can determine our own destiny.  Central to his spirituality is the 'sacrament', marijuana or mescaline.<br /><br />Kleps story, while episodically funny, is basically Paradise Lost.  Different interpretations of the mescaline message and the appropriate vehicle for expressing it divide Millbrook.  Moochers less elegant than the author overrun the idyll. Bickering and feuding increase until 'the establishment' intervenes to deliver the coup-de-grace.  The book's description of the psychedelic community is a bleak one and even if the skeptical reader discounts Kleps' opinions of his colleagues he himself is a sad example of psychedelic 'enlightenment', and condescending arrogance.

He quits his job in disgust, with himself, his college, and his life.  Halfway to an interview  for a new job he discovers that there IS no new job.  Stranded in upstate  New York state he experiences a series of synchronous coincidences which  reconnect him with his REAL life.  He recollects his inspiration and  discovers that the magical beliefs of his childhood and their mysterious  correspondance to Renaissance Hermeticism are a truer reality map than his  50's-era Positivism .  The divergence between Pierce's materialistic  cynicism and the funky complexities of his reality underline the book's  theme: &quot;There is more than one history of the world&quot;.<br />The  elegance and beauty of Crowley's prose is enough of a reason to read this  book, but for me the real fascination is the beautifully portrayed internal  struggle the central character endures between the cynical Positivism which  had defeated the faith of his youth and a hopeful magical optimism that  permits him to rediscover his source and to reinvent himself.<br />The novel  is set in the early 70's, as the Aquarian tide of rebellious youth ebbs,  leaving Determinism, though still the religion of the establishment, washed  up.  The book's locale, a funky hippieland called Blackbury Jams, is  inhabited by a variety of people in the throes of life change, as well as  the mysterious Beau Brachman,  who may or may not be an angelic messenger.  Great book!	1999-03-19

This one, written in 1969, kicked off the whole humourous sword-and-sorcery  genre.  It's a counterpoint to the heroic fantasy form: in a world of  bumbling monarchs, small farming towns and good beer two whimsical wizards  find themselves pitted against an unusual evil power beyond their abilities  to match.  Luck, imagination and unexpected allies see them through this  highly original adventure.  A perfect bedtime book, though I wouldn't  really recommend it for the under 12 crowd: the scare effects are too  imaginative.	1999-03-04

Although written in Crowley's beautiful style this novel was a severe disappointment.  The lyrical life-affirming  optimism of the preceding novel was wholly absent, replaced by a dismal  elegaic pessimism.  The book's structure is kind of clumsy too - it's a  loosely related set of chunks of stories which while interesting in  themselves don't flow well together.  It's interesting to speculate  that the novel's grim tone is related to the murder of Crowley's friend and  professor of hermetic studies Ioan Culianu, who was assassinated,  evidentally for political reasons, in 1991.  Giordano Bruno, the  Renaissance hermeticist, is a principal subject of Crowley's novel and his  life bears parallels to Culianu's.	1999-01-04
