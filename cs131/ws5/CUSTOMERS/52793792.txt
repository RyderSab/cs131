US	52793792	R1UB6EL9MK2UBF	0425198219	335481412	Strange Attractions	Books	5	12	15	N	N	Strange Attractions	Strange Attractions is an eromantic tale of three people whose lives become enmeshed while they explore their fantasies. B.G. Grantham is a physicist who studies every aspect of life as intensely as he does electromagnetism. Eric Berne seems just the opposite, as the consummate rich playboy. However, B.G. and Eric share a very special relationship and are both masters of sensuality. Charity Willis, is a sexy, independent, free spirit in need of a college education who B.G. and Eric take under their wings providing her with a unique means of obtaining that education.<br /><br />What I love about Emma Holly novels is the obvious amount of time spent on researching supporting or background information she provides. I learned more about electromagnetism in this novel than I did in high school physics! There are elements of mystery and \\"science fiction\\" in this novel that enhances the hot sex scenes and engaging story line. I thoroughly enjoyed reading Strange Attractions and I know you romantic eggheads will too.	2004-09-24

At the end of Catching Midnight, I wondered what laid ahead for Gillian and Aimery, but we can wait for another book in this series for that! Hunting Midnight is Ulric - Gillian's ex-lover - and Juliana's story.<br />The story begins with a mysterious duo, one I would love to see in the next book of this series! - seeking refuge and a new home. Their quest gives the story its general theme, but it's the love between life mates that drives the plot.<br />Juliana is a maiden fleeing the clutches of an older, amoral bethrothed, and Ulric is a heart-broken pack leader lost without love. From the moment these two meet sparks fly - literally. As Ulric initiates Juliana into the world of sensuality, she helps him find love again.<br />Emma Holly's second foray into paranormal eromatica is even better than the first and a definite must read for Holly fans. As I hinted at earlier, my wish for the next book in this series ... A story about Bastien	2003-12-13

However, this time she adds a paranormal flavor which greatly enhances the reader's pleasure.<br />Set in the mid to late 1300s Scotland, where tales of witches, warlocks, and shape-shifters are easily believable, begins the story of a waif trying to make her way in the world. From the very beginning she draws the attention of two beings who will influence the path and form she takes in life. It is this path that will lead her straight to her lifemate who must decide if being a mere mortal is enough for his lover.<br />I'll only leave you with this teaser because you have to experience this tale with an open mind. In my opinion Ms. Holly did a great job with her first paranormal eromantica. I'm looking forward to another! I'd love to know what happened to this couple ...	2003-05-09

Ms. Holly's unique mix of intense sensuality, well crafted characters and romantic plot makes Beyond Seduction a must read.<br />Set in the late 1800s England, a union between a sinfully notorious artist and a Duke's daughter would be scandalous! But this is the perfect setting for Ms. Holly to weave her tale. Nicolas Craven and Merry Vance don't just seduce us, they let us into their intimate lives and share with us all the sorrows and ultimate joys on their journey to happiness. The supporting characters --  Evangeline, Sebastian, Lavinia Vance and Althorp do their jobs well and are just as interesting to &quot;watch.&quot; In fact I would love to see my favorite supporting character, Ernest, in his own novel ...<br />As in past novels, Ms. Holly allows the reader to experience each thought, each sensation and each emotion of the characters. Read this one when you have time because you won't want to put it down.	2002-06-02

While reading about their daily life you forget just how different from the norm they are until Brite's raw, graphic imagery leaps out at you.

Twenty years ago, Jordan saw her father die at the hands of her ex-boyfriend. She made sure he was convicted of that crime. For twenty years Jordan has been trying to adjust to her father's death, while building a family, falling in and out of love and helping her patients face their demons.

In Fidelity is what I would call a good example of suspense romantica. The underlying theme of romance is spiced with erotica and suspense. Strong characterization and plot make this book a page-turner. I can't wait to see what MJ Rose comes up with next.	2001-01-08

Holly has paired together two of her best and strongest characters to go head to head in a tale that is a romance as well as erotica. Like all EH books the storyline is seamless and well written,  but I may have to call In The Flesh my favorite. After Velvet Glove I was  not looking for a story that mixed in elements of light bondage, In The  Flesh does that perfectly. Actually it is barely there, and it is intrinsic  to the romantic theme in the story. I keep underestimating Ms. Holly's  ability to top herself and every time she proves me wrong.	2000-07-06

As a person who has an aural fixation, Vox is very satisfying even though it's on paper. From the minute I picked up Baker's novel I could not put it down. Even though this novel  is told solely in dialogue form, it doesn't lose anything in the telling.  Baker is an excellent storyteller; his attention to detail is superb. His  characters' personalities are revealed to us as the story unfold and make  no mistake they are not one-track minded beings just wanting to get off, or  are they? The dialogue is witty, honest, evocative, sassy and at times as  off shooting as we tend to be in real life.	2000-06-28

I have read it several times since I bought it the very first day it came out. I was enthralled with the  theories of creation et al., and I kept thinking to myself during the  initial read &quot;how much research did Rice have to do for this  one?&quot; I know that many Rice fans have said her writing is not what it  used to be, however I think they are not true fans. They were looking for a  quick fix and not allowing themselves to slip into Rice's world. I highly  recommend this book to lovers of the supernatural and religion.	2000-06-05

At first I was a bit put off by the slow beginning of Servant of the Bones, but like a true Rice fan I read on. Then I could not put the book down! I learned a lot about Judaism and history. I was entranced by the  idea of a &quot;servant of the bones,&quot; and his many travels through  out centuries of civilization. While I was reading this book a friend of  mine was starting his Ph.D. research on big churches and the lure they  have. It's creepy the accuracy with which Rice depicts the power hungry  evangelist and his quest for immortality.	2000-06-05

Set in the early 1900s our heroine must choose between following the rules of her puritanical yet hypocritical society and her own  curiousity and lust for life. Ms. Roy's heroine is a strong-willed,  sensuous woman who, while exploring her sexuality in then British ruled  India, discovers love. This is no ordinary tale of lust, as Ms. Roy touches  upon Indian cultural history and spirituality during one of the most  important times in Indian history. Of all the books I have read by Ms. Roy  (writing as Natasha Rostova), this one is my favorite.	2000-05-28

For these reasons alone new readers to the genre of erotica should read an Emma Holly novel. However, what I particularly like is the challenge presented to her readers with each novel. BDSM (bondage domination & sadomasochism) is an area I have mixed feelings about because I associate it with pain, yet I would like to understand its role in relationships. In Cooking Up A Storm and more so in Top Of Her Game, Emma Holly helped me to see that there are various ways in which people use BDSM and she illustrates well its significance in her characters' lives. But I have never fully understood nor appreciated the many levels of BDSM until Velvet Glove. All the elements of an Emma Holly novel are there - it's well written, the plot is unique and interesting and the characters are great. Velvet Glove is a great exploration into two polar sides of BDSM. Readers will get so caught up in the storyline that they will learn about the BDSM culture while enjoying the story. This is a must have for Emma Holly fans and a great introduction for new readers of erotica.	2000-03-03
