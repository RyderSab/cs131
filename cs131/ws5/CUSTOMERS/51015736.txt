US	51015736	RQCGVYY6AWSFW	0140143955	903499644	The Anglo-Saxons	Books	4	28	32	N	Y	Idiosyncratic but delightful	I recently used this text in a graduate course on the early Middle Ages.  I like it because it does several things really well -- most of what is written about the period tends to focus on the period after Alfred the Great because historians are rightly dependent upon written sources that become relatively more plentiful in the later period.  This text draws on archaeology really nicely and gives a lot of good visuals.  The sidebar discussions of things like estimating the populations of medieval cities are really nice jumping off points for discussion.  The book does gloss over several ongoing historiographical debates and becomes, I think, problematically idiosyncratic for the eleventh century.  It also lacks discussion of some important issues such as institutional and military history (which is hard to write about in an engaging fashion) and women's history.  I wouldn't use it in an undergrad course without a lot of supplementation.	2005-09-23

It tells the little-known story of the ill-fated Scandinavian settlements in North America in the 11th century very well.  I didn't give it five stars because I honestly doubt that this is a book that will stick with me much after a year -- but it's good, light summer reading.	2005-06-15

I have always appreciated Anne Lamott's writing for its upfront honesty, downright hilarity, and the raw edge she brought to her spiritual quest. Now a lot of what she is writing seems trite -- maybe like she's gotten pretty comfortable and lost her edge.   The only thing that keeps her going is her hatred of the right wing in American politics,but she doesn't even probe that hatred very skillfully -- it's just there, like a dull toothache.  There are some moving moments, for sure, like the ski trip with her friend who is dying of cancer.  And it's nice to know she's made friends with her cellulite, I guess, but ultimately not very enlightening. <br />The spiritual insights aren't very insightful, they boil down to this: make friends with uncertainty.  Be open to the universe.  Breathe regularly.	2005-06-07

This is the second Jodi Picoult novel I've had the pleasure to read.  She is a master at characterization -- she can make the most unlikely voices seem real and even sympathetic.  She creates wonderful, wonderful complex and deeply nuanced relationships among her characters.  This book captures things like lasting love and sibling relationships and being thirteen and going crazy and losing a loved one (to death or to something else) as well as anyone I have ever read.  I'll agree that the ending seemed contrived and shocking -- in fact, it's a shared flaw with the other Picoult novel I recently read (Plain Truth).  If I read a third Picoult novel with the same flaw, I will be turned off.   I'm not turned off yet -- her characters are so wonderfully drawn that I can forgive a few inconsistencies (Campbell should NOT have been driving,  The only way he could get a license would be to lie about his seizure disorder.  Since he tried to hide the disorder all his life, he might have done so).	2005-06-05

I am a historian who uses Latin on a daily basis -- I learned it the old-fashioned way -- with Wheelock.  My son is learning Latin at the sixth-grade level and has made great progress using this series -- which seems to me to be the age level they are best for.  If I were teaching high school or college Latin this would NOT be my series of choice.  But my son has just finished the first book (I'm buying the second one today for summer study) and has a pretty good knowledge of nouns, adjectives, all four conjugations in the present, future and imperfect tense, some present tense irregular verbs, and knows to be careful with prepositions.  He's also got a pretty good understanding of Roman mythology, and domestic life thanks to this series.	2004-05-21

It's very bad, misleading, and agenda-driven from a historical and theological standpoint.  However, I'm often willing to overlook those things in support of a good story.  This is a very weak story, with wooden prose, poorly-drawn characters, gaping holes in the plot, and terribly transparent plot devices.  My husband and I finished the book, but were mostly driven by how bad it was and \\"could it get any worse.\\"  My eleven year old read the book, convinced that it was going to be great because so many of his middle-school/jr high peers loved it.  The book did keep him enthralled over three days of Christmas break. At one point he asked me whether the Teabing character's polio was somehow symbolic or significant.  I thought about it for a while and responded that I didn't think so; just another dumb plot device (along with the big dumb Albino and the red-headed female cryptologist).  After he finished the story he commented that I was wrong:  Sir Leigh is crippled in order to foreshadow the lame ending.  I think he has a point.	2004-01-28

It's well-written, engaging, told in a logical sequence, and it covers areas that other, similar books do not. It tends, however, to be a little over-corrective in its approach and minimizes the devastation of Viking violence on some more settled societies.  He calls the raiding parties &quot;exuberant, at times destructive,&quot; making them sound more like Labrador Retriever puppies than sometimes murderous bands.  Overall, though, it's a very good survey.	2003-08-29

Wunderli's reconstruction of the worldview of late medieval German peasants is imaginative, but one wonders how much is accurate.  He claims, for instance, that late-medieval people lived not in linear calendar time like today's people do, but in &quot;enchanted time,&quot; a series of intersections between the workaday world and the &quot;other world.&quot;  I'm not sure this is the case -- even today a modern person might remember something as having occurred between Christmas and Easter, but that doesn't tell us much at all about that person's overall cosmology and mental framework.  Likewise, his view of the social tensions that &quot;must have&quot; existed; the motives that &quot;must&quot; explain actions, etc. are all rooted in his own interpretative framework.  His last chapter is particularly problematic; he implies that our own actions on the stage of history will only be finally interpreted coorectly by later historians with a presumably broader viewpoint.  This whole approach privileges the interpretations of the historian over that of the subjects of history and turns us all into objects of mysterious historical forces; it also presumes a &quot;correct&quot; interpretation that can only be known to the historian.	2003-07-03

This book was one that really opened people's minds to what could be discovered about women in the early-medieval era, and it still makes for fascinating reading, particularly when she speaks   about pre-Christian family patterns and the impact of conversion onm things like marriage and inheritance.  Some of her theoretical framework is a bit dated now, but this is still a starting place for those interested in pre-modern women's history.

Given that this book was probably a major money-maker for the publisher, that ought to be a clue that there are a lot of problems associated with this system of infant management.  However, if you MUST implement it, make sure that you have the very latest edition of the book since the earlier editions are much more &quot;hard line&quot; than the later, and since Ezzo has softened his line SOMEWHAT since the book was first published.	2003-01-17

It barely touches on some important aspects of patronage -- but it is a wonderful study of how and why some abbeys managed to regroup after the Norman Conquest of England and flourish while others did not. It takes several well-known abbeys, such as Bury St Edmund's and Abingdon, and analysises the reasons for the success or failure of the monks to attrack patrons in the post-conqwuest period.  It was a good read for that aspect of the topic, but didn't discuss in any detail such important topics as women's patronage, the success of new groups such as the Augustinians or Cluniancs, or the relative success of those groups vis-a-vis the traditional Benedictines.	2002-12-10
