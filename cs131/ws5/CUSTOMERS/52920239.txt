Wanted to do file transfers via FTP in .NET?  Here you go.  This book gives a good primer on what is available for .NET and networks.  While not comprehensive (use the MSDN on-line help for the details), it gives you good ideas as to what you can do and makes for interesting reading.	2005-09-27

Whether or not another programming language is known.  It explores most of the meat in C++, and then a little more (the chapter on Algorithms will prove most helpful).  If you're starting in C++ and want to buy one book, might I suggest this one?	2005-01-27

This book is a must for those who are finding themselves just put in a situation where they must speak with customers.  Gives insight into customer types, reminds on proper etiquette both on the phone and in person and in general makes communication more effective.  Good for a geek (like myself) who is finding himself talking with the clients that (s)he supports more and more.	2004-08-04

This book is a book for the advanced programmer who says &quot;I already know how to build a halfway decent windows app, how do I take my debugging to the next level and deliver truly good apps?&quot;  <br />This book covers real-world debugging issues that plague programmers and are difficult to solve, such as multi-threading and memory issues amongst others.  Also this book has several entertaining real-world scenarios that can help give you perspective on debugging.  <br />However this book is not for the beginner, a solid grasp of programming is essential for this book.  However those with a good grasp of what programming is about with at least a basic knowledge of .NET will be right at home with this book.	2004-05-07

This book explains some of what Nanotechnology is and is not going to be.  What some of the current problems are, and the hoped for results from this research.  Investors interested in Nanotechnology as more than a mere buzzword should take note of this book, and apply some of what has been said to the companies chosen to invest in (it provides few company names though, do your own research!).  All around, it's a good beginning book and primer for investors.	2003-10-01

For example: he invented the idea of Bifocals I believe, but nowhere did I see that mentioned in the book.  It mentioned his personal life a lot (perhaps too much) as well as his political life.  However so much left uncovered for such a brilliant man...	2003-05-06

It's not supposed to be read sequentially (start to finish) but to debrief on selected topics as needed.  You can bounce from start of the book, to Threading, to Web Services, and others quite nicely as that feature is needed.  For those who program for a living and want to see what VB.net is about, this book is a must buy.	2003-02-24

Some of the earlier chapter's were well written and very intriguing, such as \\"What if Jesus Had Lived?\\" and \\"China's exploration carried further\\".  However some of it wasn't all to interesting such as \\"What if Hitler had lived?\\", to sum it up as the book says, it wouldn't matter, bleah!  It is still worth it if you liked the first book that they did.  However if you're not much of an alternative history nut to begin with, don't bother.	2003-01-07

I picked up a copy of this book and Visual Studio.net and was developing ADO.net enabled stuff easy.  Multithreading is also done exceptionally well in this book.  Web Services is something I will have to try next as well, and that chapter looks good as well.<br />In short this book is not for those who are starting out, but rather those who are veterans in the industry who know the VB syntax and want to try all the best that Visual Basic.net has to offer.	2002-07-12

Keirsey does a good job of outlining and defining some of humanity's personality traits.  While nobody could effectively document every single piece of what a human is, Keirsey does make a good example.<br />Some of the book however can be disputed, granted I'm an ISTJ personality, in the &quot;mating and temperament&quot; chapter it says my compatible personality is an ESFP and I should avoid fellow ISTJ's.  Granted I've found ESFP's a turnoff and my girlfriend is an ISTJ, is this wrong?  Or is this the exception rather than a complete rule-breaker?  Then again personality is a strange thing.	2002-05-16

This book left a little bit to be desired in documenting more on the ASP developing capabilities. Rather just telling you to &quot;check out the sample code&quot; which isn't bad advice (the sample code in Crystal Reports is fairly thorough) but I'd appreciate documentation on every possible Method, Property, etc. on the ASP Development objects in Crystal Reports.<br />In short: any power user will appreciate this book, but developers might be left hanging somewhat.	2002-02-11

Especially if you already have reporting tool experience (just as simple as knowing how to use MS Access reporting tool or something else) you'll find it so easy to follow along!<br />However if you're a power user, such as an Enterprise administrator or developer looking to add Crystal Reports data to your apps this book won't completely satisfy your needs, be prepared to step up to one of the more complete references after you're done with this book.  Still though you'll want to start here.<br />(Just as a side note: the price for Crystal Reports 8.5 the Complete Reference is cheaper here at Amazon.com than anywhere else including shipping).	2002-01-27

I kept asking myself &quot;What happened that led to the events that I'm reading about to occur?&quot;  For example, the one what if &quot;What if the South wasn't defeated in the Civil War?&quot; I was wondering the exact sequence of events, and was left hanging.  In short, there's better out there.	2001-06-07

Some of the &quot;What If's&quot; in particular I really liked, particularly the Civil War chapters and the World War II chapters.  In my humble opinion, the Revolutionary war scenarios also show just how close the Americans could've lost the war, it wasn't so much a longshot &quot;what if&quot; as to a &quot;fate had it another way&quot; sort of &quot;what if&quot;.  Anybody who is interested in history gone the other way must have this book!	2001-05-13

However some sections (such as the CFFTP section) I found disappointing.  It seems like some of this is just taken from the manual, with very little emphasis on the things that make each tag and function really useful.  One exception being the advanced security section that told me a lot of what I was doing wrong with advanced security.<br />In short, this book is a mixed bag.  If you already have the Ben Forta books, you probably won't benefit much from this book, if you're picking a first book for Cold Fusion, you might want to consider the Cold Fusion for Dummies book.  Basically a good intermediate book somewhere between Forta's 2 books and CF for Dummies.  <br />Oh, and another good plus over Forta/CF For Dummies, is that this book was written for CF 4.5 while Forta is written for CF 4.0.	2001-02-27

The book does a pretty decent job of it too (however to accomplish that flawlessly, in my humble opinion, is impossible).  Overall, any individual or small business that needs a few clues on how to do your taxes can benefit from this book.  I can't wait for the 2001 edition to come out!	2000-10-06

Granted I've labeled myself amongst the &quot;dating impaired&quot; for  awhile before I picked up this book.  I decided to review this book about 6  months after I've been through it and see where my life is.  As far as  dating goes, I'll say it has improved.  I'm not sure whether it is the  content of this book Or just my life in general.<br />Anyways, the book is  neat and filled with good stuff for those who aren't too sure about dating.  However only you can decide how the advice in the book will be used.  Some  of the information in this book you'll look at and say &quot;duh&quot; and  some you'll say &quot;will have to remember.&quot;  Do with this book what  you will.  Above all, have fun!	2000-09-17

Almost every time I'm reading this book, I notice a seatmate nearby  reading over my shoulder.  Why?  Because this book has something for  everyone who wanted to know about how to manage their money.  Who wants to  manage their money better?  Everybody I know could use a little help.  For  those of you who have asked questions like &quot;what kind of insurance  should I by for life, auto, etc?&quot; or &quot;Should I be investing in  Aggressive Mutual funds, or something more passive?&quot;, you must buy  this book!	2000-09-13

For those who know any web based programming languages, this book is for  you.  It gives you the scoop on WAP and what makes it tick.  It presents  the basic syntax of WAP in a fairly easy to understand format (put it this  way, if you know HTML you practically know WAP).  It also has an awesome  section on how to integrate it with what you already know (In particular  the Cold Fusion section was awesome!  I leave it to those who know ASP,  JSP, and XML to judge the other pieces).  <br />In short, don't buy this if  you're just starting web development, I would recommend you learn HTML and  one server side language (ASP, ColdFusion, etc.). If you do that, then  you're ready to learn WAP with this book and build some truly awesome stuff  for the ever blooming wireless world!	2000-09-08

However the plot is more sophisticated.  It starts a little slow, but after page  200 (out of about 1000) you will not be able to put the book down.  All the  dimensions of the book (in one corner we have Ming/Nomuri, in the other  corner there's a shot Russian pimp, in the other is a bunch of guys working  on a cruiser) will make you constantly guess, what's next?  Then it all  just comes together in a truly awesome spectacle that is the ending!  A  must get!	2000-09-01

This book is a well written piece, geared for people who are somewhat  intrigued by the idea of trading stocks to make a living.  After reading  this book you will want to:<br />1) Run away from the day trading idea and  never visit it again<br />2) Immediately call your online broker, and start  placing your first day trades<br />3) Read more about the idea of day trading  in other books, testimonies from the people who are there, etc.<br />In short,  this book will wake you up to everything that it takes to be a day trader.   If you take options 1 and 2, you probably wouldn't be a good day trader and  would be wise to avoid the idea completely.  If you think of #3, you will  probably wind up a successful trader.  Take this book as a first step, and  make sure to take many more before you execute your first day trading  orders.  With that in mind, good luck to all who try day trading!	2000-08-25

This book has been used a lot for reference on the many pieces  of SQL Server.

While I'd take this as a sampling of the people who've been burned, the stories of success on the web number far greater.  This book  should be treated as the exception, rather than the rule.
