US	52891720	RUT961Q5L1AHJ	0312203136	319852977	The Hiawatha	Books	5	22	24	N	N	A gusty and profoundly moving book	Other reviewers have touched on the way the book describes the hardscrabble Minneapolis slums; suffice it for me to say  Treuer uses his obvious talent very, very well here. He knows what he is writing about, and  he writes about it extremely well. <br />The realism of the writing does not  take away from the wonderful storytelling in this novel. Treuer's  choice--fratricide--is gutsy and engaging, and his characters are  believable and decent. <br />Death pervades the book; the deaths of Simon's  father, his brother, even that of a goose force the reader to see how close  to death of us live all the time. Even Simon's job is  brutally dangerous.  Even though death is everywhere, Treuer's writing is brilliantly alive: his  descriptions defy any characterization that I could try to use for  them--they are just that good, from the beginning of the book to the end.  <br />Perhaps the moving interesting and moving character for me is Betty,  Simon's mother. Her love for the people around her is so hopeless  and deep  that my heart clenches even now to think of her with a dead husband, one  son dead, and  another a murderer. The quintessential survivor, she works,  scrapes by, and tolerates a scumbag landlord for the sake of children she  knows have very little chance in the world. But she gives them what chances  she can, by hook or by crook, via the bridge of her back. No wonder she  habitually rebuffs the tender affections of a decent man.<br />I am afraid I  haven't done justice to this book; it is a terrific novel by a true talent.  The other book of his that I have read, _Little_, is another emotionally  evocative work that I cannot recommend highly enough.	2000-07-04

Her biography of the Brontes is just terrific, and with this collection of letters, Barker has topped herself. <br />It's always difficult  to review a book like this: so much of what makes the book wonderful is the  quality of the letter writers themselves--and the Brontes were exceptional  letter writers. <br />But Barker's editing and her selection shine in this  volume. She tells us enough background information so that we understand  the correspondence, but she doesn't bog us down with a lot of details  (those she put in her biography, which I also recommend).	2000-06-15

Huxley I can usually take or leave, but not Antic Hay: there are just too many farces to decipher for me to put it down. Huxley's women are beautiful and easy; his men are amoral and excrutiatingly clever. <br />But underlying  their antics is a novel of incredible complexity. Huxley makes his  attentive readers squirm as we recognize our own pretensions and idiocies  in his archetypal characters. Ouch, ouch, ouch.<br />The other gift in this  novel is that it has helped me appreciate and understand the work of other  writers such as Waugh and Mitford: i.e., in order to enjoy them, you have  to suspend your own understanding of life and realize that there actually  was a thriving class of people in England who didn't have jobs, relied on  servants, and had no lives to speak of. And were bored to tears by their  sumptuous privilege, believe it or no.<br />For modern readers, I'd say this  is a pretty tough read. I know a respectable amount of both French and  Latin, and I had to look up at least part of most of those passages.  But  if you're prepping for the vocabulary section of the GRE or the SAT...this  book will provide you with myriad words to look up and learn, including the  wonderful &quot;callipygous&quot;.<br />Maybe I should give the rest of  Huxley's work another reading...	2000-06-13
US	52891720	R2CPRRLVL71UDH	006018373X	15698600	Presidential Ambition	Books	3	14	15	N	N	A timely and original work	In his book, Shenkman does an excellent job of ferreting out and explaining presidential ambition. While it may seem that Shenkman is concentrating on the negative, he is vigorously fair, and his ability to  empathize with his subjects is his greatest asset. His central themes are:  <br />1.Our presidents have been (from Washington onward) insatiably ambitious  men who have done not-so-nice things to get and maintain power;<br />2.Their  ambition and willingness to bend the rules often provided the leadership  needed to steer the country through difficult times; and<br />3.Changes in the  media, immigration, political parties, and technology forced presidents to  take extreme measures to get and keep power.<br />What makes his book even  more interesting is that he uses evidence from the historical record of  presidents *before* Truman. And Shenkman spends a lot of time discussing  presidents that most people know nothing about: Cleveland, Hayes, Buchanan,  Polk (and his chapters on Buchanan and Polk are the best of the lot).  This  alone makes the book worth reading: I can't wait to suggest it to my  blowhard uncle who claims Clinton was the first president besides Nixon to  lie in office. <br />So why 3 stars, given that I am so enthusiastic about the  content and the rigor of Shenkman's work? His writing has been called  \\"breezy\\" and \\"journalistic\\". And his prose is both of those things, but  there are times in this book that Shenkman gets in his own way with his  self-conscious prose.  He overuses two devices that should never, ever be  overused in prose--sentence fragments and slang. The first time he used the  word \\"caved\\" to describe a presidential capitulation, it was refreshing,  but by the fourth I was tired of it. More annoying was his continued use of  sentence fragments. Some of his points flourished with the punchy use of  such informal prose; but in other cases, the device felt to me like an  affection-an affection unworthy of someone like Shenkman whose prose in  other places was indeed breezy and graceful. <br />That said, these problems  are not serious enough to diminish the maturity of Shenkman's commentary. I  think it is an excellent book for people (of any age) interested in the  presidency. Some readers may be put off by Shenkman's moral relativism, and  I guarantee the book would make for a lively discussion for a book group.	2000-06-08
US	52891720	R3LOC4T6H6KSBO	0375409084	71254966	Gertrude and Claudius	Books	4	9	11	N	N	Well crafted and diverting	This story is a treat from the first page to the last: Updike's Getrude is believable: she's beautiful (Updike has a definite gift for describing feminine beauty in his prose, and he uses it here with his descriptions of Gertrude and Ophelia), spoiled, and bereft of useful life skills (as a  princess would be).<br />The way the story unfolds is deliciously subtle. For  instance, I began to nervous that every time Feng/Claudius always mentioned  his love for the queen in the same breath as he remarked on his brother's  unworthiness for the throne. It seemed Gertrude was inexorably tied to the  throne for the ambitious Claudius; and Updike leaves us questioning which  Claudius loved more--the Queen or the throne? And when Claudius does  finally attain both the Queen and the throne, the changes in his behavior  name his choice. Another master stroke: we never really do figure out just  why the Queen can't give herself wholly to Horwendil until he shows himself  to be a small, vindictive cuckold and we get the full story of his  treatment of Sela. The Queen herself reacts to Howendil on pure intuition;  she is seldom privy to the words and deeds that so distinguished Horwendil  as a royal ..... Such subtlety makes darned good storytelling, especially  when combined with Updike's usual, graceful prose.  <br />I rather  wondered--and still do--what the point was in using three sets of historic  names for the main characters in the book. On one hand, I rather liked the  reminder of the ancient origins of the story; on the other, I found having  to figure out who's who in each part slightly (just a bit, not much)  distracting. It isn't difficult, and yet I'm left wondering whether the  artistic device--whatever it was--was worth the distraction.  But this is  quibbling; I suppose I should be grateful Updike has such faith in his  readers' intellects. :-)<br />Finally, the length of the book makes it just  about perfect for summer travel reading. You'll never get through Rabbit,  Run on your trip; but Gertrude and Claudius is a manageable read to go with  your airport coffee and cinnabun!	2000-06-04

First, if you love reading about writers and writing (as I do), you'll love this book. Good writers and  brilliant poets open their hearts in their essays and write frankly about  the tough times they have gone through--e.g., the times they hated their  work, the times they weren't producing anything. And also they write about  the troubles and joys of being young, and what it is like to have brilliant  and flawed mentors in a very special, challenging academic situation. <br />At  first, I thought the book was meant to be an unabashed hagiography of Paul  Engle. Nope. Midway through the book arrive the essays from former  workshoppers who, like W.D. Snodgrass, were NOT Engle's favored proteges;  those essays give you even more insight into the workshop and Engle  himself. <br />More personally, the book brought me home to Iowa City, where I  lived for over 12 happy years. Although most of the book's recollections  center on the 1950s and 1960s, some of the places and businesses the  writers describe in their essays thrive today.<br />I had a lovely time  reading this book, and I think others will, too.	2000-06-02

In this book, you get a lovely distillation of JQA's family life and his most important public contributions (none of which came during his presidency...which merits (and  gets) only one chapter in this book). Nagle shows you every aspect of JQA  without bogging you down in details: by the end of the book, you feel like  Adams is a friend of yours. You get to see him being flawed (overly  stiffnecked, irresponsible with money), and you get see him being heroic  (fighting the Gag Rule). <br />Although it may seem unimportant, I must add  that this is one of those wonderful books that I am glad I bought in  hardcover: the cover is classy, and the printing, proofing,  editing--everything-- feels like quality, just the way a hardcover book  should feel.	2000-05-27

What a treat I had reading it. There were strong, feminist themes throughout the book that reminded me a little of Urquhard's  collegue, Margaret Atwood (argh! I told myself I wasn't going to make this  comparison...), but the work in Changing Heaven is much gentler than what I  would expect to see from Atwood (whom I also enjoy). <br />And then there are  Urquhard's landscapes. Normally, I'm an inveterate skimmer of descriptive  prose, but not here. Her descriptions were just too good to miss.<br />Last  but not least, Emily Bronte shows up toward the end of the book.

The writing is enviably beautiful and rich; the theme is intelligent and challenging. Ostensibly, the debate between mysticism versus rationalism sunders Bernard and June.  But each of the combatants possesses the worst traits of the other's  ideology. Bernard has a slavish faith in the scientific method, while June  feels the necessity to shore up her spirituality with flawless rhetoric and  argumentation. They must both explain: and the irony is that their marriage  ends, even though they are both talking about the same thing: the truth as  they perceive it.  <br />While this certainly isn't a new theme (postmodernism  and its subsequent backlash has provided us with a lot of reading lately),  McEwan handles it creatively and respectfully. He gives us no answers and  never insults our intelligence. <br />Finally, McEwan brings up the question  of evil and how we respond to it. In one situation, our narrator would turn  away from it given his choice(when Bernard faces the mob, and the narrator  doesn't); in another situation, the narrator confronts evil in another,  bigger man and in himself. <br />It is a short, worthwhile, well-crafted read.	2000-05-22

I found it to be much gentler than her other novels: there isn't any of the astounding weirdness of The Good Apprentice or The Severed Head: no  incest, no murder, no wife-swapping. <br />As a result, it is an interesting  novel to read for the change of pace it offers in the body of her work. It  offers perhaps a subtler take on repeated Murdochian themes of betrayl and  alienation--artistic, intellectual, marital, sexual, and so forth.  <br />I  have always wondered why A.S. Byatt chose to highlight The Sandcastle in  her book about women's writing _Imagining Characters_; perhaps Byatt sees  some of the same qualities in the story that I do.	2000-05-14

If nothing else, there is something reassuring in knowing that some of my heroes have even  sloppier desk-keeping habits than me....

So I figured the whole genre wasn't for me (after all, there's lots to read out there...)But I have read Whitman, and  Cherkoski was able to help me make the connections between the poets he  highlights and the American poetic tradition I've always adored.<br />I'd  never pick up a book like this on my own...but I skimmed through part of  this book at the library one day...and the prose hooked me. I loved it.  Clear and clean--the best nonfiction prose has to offer. And usually I  can't stand the &quot;I was there and knew all these famous people and we  were, like, so totally wild&quot; war stories--but Cherkovski doesn't  indulge in that much, and when he does, it's amusing rather than cloying.  <br />I'm grateful that this book caught my eye: the book sampled several  poets I can't wait to read more of like John Wieners, Lawrence  Ferlinghetti, and Michael McClure. It is a good nonfiction book that makes  you want to read more....	2000-05-08

I agree with a few of the other reviewers: the &quot;public life&quot; of  JQA (one my favorite presidents...) gets a tad too little attention for my  taste in the book. Just a tad: what is there is well-written and  interesting enough to propel the book forward. <br />Though I am no expert on  the subject, I thought Nagel was a little tough on JQA'S mother Abigail  Adams. Actions and words that Nagel seemed to condemn as overbearing in her  I found to be...well...*nothing* compared to my mother's ability to nag  (Sorry, ma). That is, they were the sort of  keep-your-nose-clean-and-your-trousers-buckled exhortations I'd pretty much  expect from anybody's mommy. <br />But this is a small quibble with an  otherwise good book. I found the best, most moving writing when Nagel  describes JQA's last years in Congress. Here, Nagel evokes respect and  sympathy for the JQA who was both drawn to and repulsed by political  discourse. And Nagel's treatment of the obvious love between JQA and his  wife was touching but not cloying--the best kind of love story.	2000-05-08

This book is an attempt to trace how several reknowned authors make revisions on their own work. The lesson I took away from the book was that authors rewrite  many, many times and work through a highly individualized process to  discover a process that works. That is a worthwhile message, and I did  leave the book with some ideas to try. <br />Unfortunately, the book is quite  uneven in that not every author seemed particularly willing to share their  process. For instance, I left the section with Joyce Carol Oates wondering  why Woodruff bothered included it; plainly, getting information from her  was tantamount to pulling teeth and the result is superficial.	2000-04-10

I can  see why some omissions rankle: but, but BUT! Look at what's here! Almost  all of the stories are nothing short of brilliant. Yes, &quot;The  Lottery&quot; was probably amongst the best of the century, but it is  anthologized everywhere in the universe: many of these are not. Many are  not-so-well-known works by the best writers the 20th century had. I could  quibble about many of the selections. For instance, I wouldn't have chose  &quot;Greenleaf&quot; to represent one my favorites, Flannery O'Connor, or  &quot;The Killers&quot; to represent Ernest Hemingway. But they're still  great stories, worth including and worth reading. <br />The best I think are  those from the early part of the century, but that's probably my own bias  talking. I'm not a fan of many of the representatives chosen for the latter  half of the century, and the selection for 1999--yuck! But I'm willing to  trust Updike's judgment over my own for a little while, and if he thinks  Annie Proulx is worth reading...ok: It's worth a few pages of my time to  find out. <br />The anthology also does a good job of tracing in fiction the  transformations of American culture: the first are immigrant stories, the  next are primarily rural-based farming stories (A Jury of Her Peers--great  story), and then the last are urban, ex-urban, and suburban stories.  <br />Read and enjoy.	2000-01-23

I can understand how it may be read (superficially) as a typical fifties/Star Trek 'omigosh-the-machines-have-taken-us-over&quot; novel. I  do think, however, that Vonnegut has a lot to say in this book about the  scaryass, stupidass ways we order ourselves in the pursuit of social  status.  He has created in this book a society of rigidities and  absurdities: how different are the formalized executive games in _Player_  from the informal good-old-boys golf game...no women invited...that occur  every weekend in the real world. How many proteges are groomed or rebuffed   based on their conduct during those golf games? This is an example of the  commentary on conformity that I believe Vonnegut created in  _Player_.<br />There's a lot in this book for the modern reader, especially if  you like Vonnegut (which I obviously do...)	1999-02-08

I struggled through _Wolf Willow_ when I was in undergrad...it was either unenjoyable or I was not at the right time in my life to appreciate it. So when a friend gave me her copy of _Angle_, I took it dubiously, not knowing  what a treat I was going to have. <br />I don't consider this a  &quot;guy's&quot; book at all. Stegner, unlike many male authors, does a  decent job of developping a woman's character with Susan--though I found  her much less likeable than many readers (but you don't have to like  characters to find them interesting). The contemporary story that unfolds  between the reluctantly fatherly Lyman and his hippie-flippy assistant also  charmed me. <br />Marriage vs. infidelty and family vs. individualism are  strong themes in this novel. The self-indulgence of a mother and a man's  best friend that leads to trajedy for a family; the man who consistently  choses his own ego and rigid ethics over the security and happiness of his  family; the son who can't empathize with his father's last gasp for  independence; the exwife cum widow who forgets the &quot;sickness and in  health&quot; portion of the marriage vows; even the loss of individualism  caused by Lyman's body forcing his housekeeper to carry him, bathes him,  and clothe him; these themes are set in the West, a the cornerstone of  individualism in American culture.<br />This is a great novel.

The story engages  on several levels: you spend much time debating (especially after Allington  sees &quot;God&quot;) whether we aren't simply privy to the pitiful  delusions of a pill and alcohol gulping man on his last legs rather than  dealing with the understatedly fiendish Dr. Underhill and his monstrous  creation.<br />Who knows, and who cares?

Her descriptions of the Bronte's home, village, and schooling were lively, engaging, and believable. The book educates, occasionally entertains, and sometimes annoys.<br />I knew nothing of any of the Brontes before I read the book: that's why, in fact, I read the book.  Since we have more documentation about Charlotte, and some of Charlotte's comments aren't so nice, then Charlotte gets the brunt of Barker's judgement. Since we seem to know so  little about what actually happened inside Anne's head, it is possible to canonize Anne, as Barker seems to do. We can make Anne what we want: she didn't tell us otherwise--the way Charlotte did. Why, for instance, did Barker expect Charlotte  to &quot;do&quot; something for her brother, and yet Barker has no castigation for the other siblings? I'd hate to think of my personality being judged by the sometimes petty and selfish things I write in my own!  journal; and I would like to extend the same indulgence to Charlotte. <br />On a positive note, though, I admire Barker's gutsiness for taking a position about Charlotte at all. I liked Barker's revisionist attitude toward the interpretation of all the Bronte's works. Perhaps Barker's devotion to *all* of the Bronte's work--not just Charlotte's--will bring more interest in Agnes Grey or the Tenant of Wildfell Hall. That would be fabulous.	1998-07-31

Eliot you will love this book the way I did.	1998-07-01

Beran is a lively writer who has fun with words; I laughed out loud at his sardonic phrases like &quot;Sinister Capitalist&quot; and his asides (the one about Edie Sedgwick was a hoot). Beran opines, and reading the book is rather like being the listener in a one-sided (yet enjoyable) argument about public policy and American culture. Even so, Beran substantiates his facts with endnotes; we as readers know when Beran stops reporting and starts postulating. That's fair.<br />One criticism is the editing. I did like Beran's writing style, but the work could have benefitted from an editor with a firm hand. Beran's arguments meander. Occasionally-only very occasionally, though-his spry use of language becomes burdensome rather than engaging for the reader.	1998-06-10

I quickly tired of the &quot;ooooo let's snigger at the fat  women&quot; snidery in his essay about the Illinois State Fair. (Please! It's tiresome when Letterman pulls out that old schtick, let alone some one with Wallace's obvious literary gifts.) Other than this, Wallace has a fine sense of the ridiculous as well as the salient: despite their supposed lightness, the state fair, cruise, and television essays have poignant observations about how we Americans consume entertainment.	1998-03-30

Tanenhaus has done superb work: his biography of Chambers is methodically documented and beautifully crafted. He challenges us readers who are used to the black and white moral harangue of character sketches to understand the shades of grey in the Hiss/Chambers episode, the anti-Communist fervor following the hearings and trials, and the personalities involved (e.g. Chambers, Hiss, their wives, and Richard Nixon, to name only a few).  <br />  Tanenhaus gives us no easy answers and forces us to think that 1) just because some were maliciously and falsely named as Communist spies doesn't mean that every one accused was innocent; and 2) a man who can lie can also tell the truth.   <br /> If anything, Tanenhaus is somewhat too loyal to Mr. Chambers. Alger Hiss's character is less well developed in this book than I wanted as a longtime student of the Hiss/Chambers affair. It is reasonable, though, that Hiss was somewhat the privileged, pretty-boy smartass Tanenhaus portrays Hiss to be. Tanenhaus thankfully doesn't indulge himself much in his personal feelings. He sticks closely to the evidence and remembers that being a richboy like Hiss is not justly punishable by 44 months in the federal pen, just as being a slovenly, fat, and uncharismatic little man like Chambers doesn't preclude literary brilliance or profound courage.  <br /> I never expected to like--or even understand--Mr. Chambers, but by the end of this book, I did both.	1998-03-24
