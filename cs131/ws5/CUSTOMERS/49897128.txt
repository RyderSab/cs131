US	49897128	RXL0AKLF78UT7	1587671204	306267520	The Hides	Books	4	3	4	N	N	Great sequel	Brief background: this is the sequel to The Turtle Boy, which is one of the best horror novellas of recent years. A young boy, Timmy Quinn, and his friend stumble upon a young boy at the local pond. The boy is letting the turtles in the pond eat from his flesh...it's not long before Timmy realizes he can communicate with the dead. He soon has a mystery on his hands that involves not only the townfolk, but his own father.     Book two in the Timmy Quin series sees Timmy living in Ireland with his father and grandmother. Though he tries to escape his new \\"curse\\", he discovers that the dead can find him no matter where he goes. There is a ghost in his grandmother's house that has someting to tell him. And the factory where his father works is teeming with angry spirits who wish his lineage dead. (The Quinn family is pretty screwed up, now that i think about it.)  And there is still the issue of just what his father's past holds.    Burke's prose is graceful and poingnant, and a lot of care has gone into this character. The series is fastly becoming one of my favorites. Like the X-files or Lost, the more it progresses aand answers questions, the more we find ourselves with new questions and secrets.     I highly recommnd picking up both The Turtle Boy and The Hides--Burke is sure to become one of horror's greats in a very short time.	2005-09-13

I can't understand why he's not more popular, even considering Koontz's afterward wehre he points to one reason why. These stories are fantastic and engrossing. Moonchasers and Out in the Dark are the two that shine. All of them have at least something to do with the darkness of humanity, from pedophilia to suicide, to murder. Very moving at times as well. I highly recommend to fans of dark literature.	2005-06-30

The four novellas in this book are extremely entertaining, well written, and imaginative.  Lebbon has a handle on the horror genre that I've not seen in a while. It's a nice mix of character and atmosphere. I actaully cared about the people in these stories. <br /> <br />The  first story starts out well, then, for me, becomes too comic bookish. The book jacket says he wrote a new story for the collection and I'm gonna say this was it. It just seemed out of place with the others. It wasn't that it was bad, it just wasn't up to par with the rest. It should have gone in the middle of the book, because it made me dubious about what was to follow. <br /> <br />But the second story, about a group of people trapped in a house amidst a wolrdwide plague of death and evil ghosts was pure classic horror. Imagine a zombie story where the undead are trying to break into a house, except replace zombies with ghosts that mutilate you. This was my favorite story in the book, and could easily be made into a film. It was great. <br /> <br />The third was a bit more psychological, about a man who makes a deal to be brought back to life. Once alive, he must appease his benefactors or suffer the consequences. It was very dark, and didn't submit itself to cliches. Again, a great story. <br /> <br />The last story was in fact a classic zombie tale, but again, it was very dark and, while using some cliches, managed to be more about the family involved rather than the undead. There were some nice stressful scenes. It was actually very touching, and ended beautifully.  <br /> <br />I can't recommend Lebbon enough at this point. If it wasn't for the first story being a bit off kilter, I'd give this collection a 5. Great stuff.	2005-05-03
US	49897128	R2TB9FV2ATQKLY	0843951427	458484788	The Hour Before Dark	Books	4	6	6	N	N	Psychologically meaty	This was my fiirst Clegg title. I'd heard it was his best, and it definitely didn't let me down. The nice thing about it is that it relies heavily on atmosphere and social issues, rather than gore and blood. <br /> <br />Which is not to say it isn't bloody. It most certainly is, but the blood is shown only peripherally, which gives it a darker feel. What really is the most terrifying is whether or not the characters are losing thier minds.  <br /> <br />This is a dysfunctional family to say the least. Yet, somehow, Clegg lets us know that it is not their fault. Slowly and surely he lets us into their past, and the messed up home life that transformed them into walking mental patients: The writer who can't keep a relationship, the gay little brother who is beyond surly, the sleepwalking sucidal sister. And the memory of a mother who walked out on her family when they were just kids. And of course the father, now a collection of body parts in the town morgue. <br /> <br />Clegg is one of the few writers who seems able to trust that his audience is smart, and he doesn't go for cliches as a result. The book doesn 't end like a traditional novel, it just sort of ends, which for me, rang truer to life. <br /> <br />My one problem involved a part of the mystery that Clegg stretched out over the novel. I won't go into it since it's a spoiler, but I had it figured out very early on, as I can only assume most readers did. It's didn't hurt the novel, but it wasn't the big revelation it was supposed to be when that scene came.  <br /> <br />Lastly, the style of this novel is fantastic. It doesn't flow from page to page like traditional novles, it sort of cuts about, jumping from scene to scene. There may be three different moments on a page, separated by page breaks. In that  sense it feels like a movie, it makes it a very quick read.  <br /> <br />I highly recommend to anyone who likes dark, sad stories.	2005-04-12
US	49897128	R2CKMMOWVCUZIH	0553285637	813744810	Savage Season	Books	4	2	2	N	N	The start of something beautiful	There's little to be said of the Hap and Leonard novels other than they are immensely entertaining, witty, and fast paced. Lansdale's voice is at times hilarious, and at times poignant. There are real souls to these characters, and you really care about them.  <br /> <br />In this first installment, Hap and Leonard find themselves in the middle of a treasure hunt gone awry. It's a very short novel that can be read in a day if you've got the time. Plot-wise, it's not as good as Rumble Tumble or Mucho Mojo or the others, but it relies heavily on character development, and that is always a good thing.  <br /> <br />Like Elmore Leonard, Lansdale's cast of characters are bizzare to the nth degree, yet despite their zaniness, he manages to make them human. This has got to be my favorite Buddy series. Always gets me laughing.	2005-03-12
US	49897128	R5PVNHBP2LNYW	0345410998	828831982	Street Boys	Books	2	2	3	N	N	Concept Good, execution terrible	This nearly became one of the handful of books I've put down before finishing it. I stuck it out, but it really wasn't worth it. The idea is a fantastic one, and as a lover of WWII fiction I was really looking forward to something different. But the language and events are all over the place. The action is very hard to follow and in just about every battle I had a hard time telling what was going on. It also could have benefitted from a map of Naples--I've never been to Naples, and his descriptions of locations left me baffled. One moment some kids are chasing a tank down an alley, the next moment they're in a castle. Huh? Where did a castle come from? I was lost. He also builds up some major character only to have them fizzle out later, as if they were never really imporatant.     On top of all that, the Germans are portrayed here like the bumbling idiots that chase down Indiana Jones. Everybody knows the German's were horrible and intelligent, and there's no way they would have gone out like they did in this book. True, a fight in the streets of Naples did take place, but many lost thier lives. I think only two kids die in the book, at least that you witness. That's just not realistic.     Anyone who wants a good WWII story should read The Good German by Joseph Kannon.  Skip this	2005-02-01
US	49897128	R65VN2CZPTSSL	0843952040	875977385	Messenger	Books	3	2	2	N	N	Novel idea, could have been better	This was my first Ed Lee book. It had a lot of nice gorey scenes in it. And the idea of mailmen as messengers of the Devil was very tongue in cheek. The story and plot were nothing special, but it did keep me entertained. Most of the characters were intriguing as well. As a fast, fun read, I sort of liked this.  <br /> <br />However, I was dissapointed in knowing the end about half way through the book. This was seomthing i noticed with Lee, he doesn't trust his audience to be smart enough to know what's going on.  There is a scene where a repairman comes to a woman's house. She is clearly possesed by the Messenger. We know she is going to kill this guy, but Lee drags it out for something like 12 pages. I was like, okay, I get it, kill the guy already, you're not fooling anyone. Stuff like that occurs throughout the book.  It's frustrating. <br /> <br />My other problem was that none of these characters acted like humans. I'm not talking about the ones possesed by the Messenger, but rather the unaffected ones. The protagonist's employees butcher half the town and kill themselves in the course of three days, and she just goes through life all ho-hum. Doesn't take a day off work, doesn't seek counseling, doesn't spend hours on the phone with friends. There was a serial killer in my neighborhood growing up. When the police caught him, we were numb for months, the local schools offerred counselors (he was a student), and the parents formed a watch group. News reporters were on every corner. I didn't read about one reporter pestering the protagonist in this book. At one point one of the possessed employees commits suicide in a horrific (kudos to Lee on this scene) way, in front of the protagonist, and the protagonist just goes home and shrugs it off. I don't know about you, but I'd be in a state of shock. I mean come on, a dose of reality please. <br /> <br />Anyway, barring that, it was indeed a fun, mindless, book. If you like gore and  interesting interpretations of hell, it's worth a read. I will certainly read more of his stuff.	2004-11-24
US	49897128	R3DOC9HJ5NTHXP	0451204530	356134546	Code To Zero	Books	3	2	3	N	N	fast and trite	Follet knows his history, which always makes reading his stuff both fun and educational. In this story we're taken back to the McCarthy era and dropped in the world of communist spies and the race to control space. It opens with our hero Luke waking up in a train station bathroom with his memory wiped. He must discover who he is and why he has amnesia. Plot twists ensue. Regrettably, the story is fairly easy to decipher from page one.  But thankfully the characters are pretty interesting, even if they are over the top sometimes.  AS always, his women are very strong independant characters, which is something I find refreshing. Follet's writing is usually a bit better than than this, and he seems more comfortable when he  is in his WWII mode. (Actually, some of the story flashes back to WWII). That this occurs during the 50's may have been one reason the environments and action seem dull.  I read this in a couple of days, breaking for work and what not, but I could easily have finished it  in a weekend, and I'm a slow reader. The only thing that really bothered me was that it took place over two days. Seemed kind of implausible to me.  But it was a fun read overall.	2004-11-18

I know you're all like, &quot;how stupid&quot;, but oh man what a fun novel. It's a zombie film on paper, completely cheesy but written with such love for the genre you can't not enjoy it. And hey, though you may scoff at the talking zombie thing, at least it's original.  <br />  <br /> two points that make this novel great:  <br />  <br /> 1. This isn't a feel good story. Lead characters are subject to dismemberment and death. And the evil in man is just as bad as the evil in the walking dead.  <br />  <br /> 2. This was one of those endings that actually had me begging for more. I'm dying for a sequel. C'mon Keene, bust out a sequel!	2004-07-30

It was like neither. Sure it was noirish in the sense the hero (antihero i guess) was a murderer with a police record a mile long, but the sinister story was pretty bland. He didn't seem to care about the mystery very much either, which made me likewise almost not care. The ending was okay, there was a slight tiwst that caught me off guard, which i liked. But having to slosh through 250 pages of stagnant story almost made it not worth it. The character of the police chief was very well done. If he's in other books by thompson, I'll read them.  <br />  <br /> I think the biggest problem was that it felt like Thompson was just trying to fill up pages sometimes, like he said to himself, &quot;Well, i need to fill up five pages in this chapter somehow,&quot; so he just made the hero walk around the hotel for five pages, not doing a whole bunch.  <br />  <br /> I guess overall, characters were pretty good, plot was slow and boring.	2004-07-30

For a man who gave us I Am Legend, and Hell House, and Stir of Echos, and a bunch of other brilliant books, his latest releases (such as the reprinted Now You See It) are simply abysmal.  <br />  <br /> I am about forty pages from the end of this book and am seriouly considering not even finishing it. I've only not finished (excluding some books i hated in high school--The Good Earth anyone?) maybe four books my whole life.  <br />  <br /> Where to start with why this book is bad. Well, to begin, it's completely rehashed. Our hero spends two days getting chased through the California woods by a man who wants to kill him. And rape him. Can you say Deliverance? Okay, so the book acknowledges that part, as the endorsement even says it's &quot;straight out of Deliverance&quot; or some such nonsense. But come on, it's not even an original twist on the subject. It's the same as that stupid Ice T movie, as a bunch of television episodes from the 80s. The so-called &quot;chase through the forest for your life&quot; game. Secondly, these characters are boring archetypes. The hero who believes in karma practically has the ability to talk to woodland creatures. And the bad guy is just bad for no reason. Oh wait, he's jealous. Yes, that's right, he wants to kill his friend because he's jealous of said friend's success. C'mon, I don't buy it. <br />  <br /> On top of that, anyone who's been hiking for a weekend or more knows that the odds of seeing a bear,a mountain lion, another bear, a rattle snake, etc, are slim at best. I'm surprised the hero didn't run into an elf, a goblin, Jimmy Hoffa, Atlantis, or any other elusive noun as well. And the lightning? Please!  <br />  <br /> And finally, and maybe this is a style opinion, but who actually has arguments with themselves when they're alone ALL DAY LONG! This character does this throughout the whole book: <br />  <br /> Yeah right, all of a sudden I'm a champion swimmer, he thought to himself.  <br />  <br /> &quot;Shut up Hansen, just keep moving.&quot; <br />  <br /> Once or twice okay, but all the time? Is the character nuts or something? <br />  <br /> Well, you get the idea, this book is not only a dissapointment but a complete piece of (insert expletive) from a writer who is otherwise truly gifted. Do yourself a favor and skip it.	2004-07-29
US	49897128	R1J56WE4KIQOV3	0553283685	47311872	Hyperion (Hyperion Cantos)	Books	3	5	9	N	N	starts well, drags near the end	I'm a harsh critic, so my three stars means i still recommend this book. Simmons has a knack for language, that's for sure. And being able to create an entire universe that we can understand in all its complexities is not an easy thing to do. Having said that, the book starts out really well. I'll forego plot but to say we're dealing with seven travelers on a pilgrimage, each who must tell his &quot;story&quot; to the others concerning why he/she is making the trip. Echoes of Chaucer's Canterbury Tales for sure, and even hints of Arthurian legend as well. The first story, told by father Hoyt--which actually is not his story but told from the diary of his mentor--had me hooked. It was Sci Fi, it was theological, it was imaginative and fresh. Simmons made Hyperion a mystery in it's own right, an unexplored planet with creepy dwellers and underground labrynths. The Shrike, its mysterious lone alien inhabitant, is either God or the Devil or just some mysterious alien who kills at will. It forged me on. Kassad's tale was pretty good, though not nearly as interesting. It was militaristic, adventurous, about a fallen soldier who should be a hero but is villified due to actions that saved the world. Not to mention Simmons delves into temporal anomolies and paradoxes during this tale and doesn't explain it all too well. Maybe that was his point, i don't know. Weintraub, whose daughter is regressing to her newborn state (who is 30 when the tale is told) tells the tale of watching his daughter live backwards in time. While interesting, and unique, it dragged on until the inevitable conclusion I knew was coming. Simmons chronicled 30 years of living backwards...it was too much. Get on with it already. Lamia's tale is pure pulp detective story. I liked it, it's fun and fast paced. Throw in an AI consipracy about murdering other AIs as well as the human race, and yeah, it could be a movie. No gripes there, all kudos. And finally the Consul's tale, which like Hoyt's is told from the comlog of his grandfather, is pretty boring. It sets up a revelation any seasoned reader is able to spot from the beginning of the book, which is not a big deal, but it takes focus of the pilgramage--and therefore the book--away from the Shrike and all its deified qualities. Basically it makes the first 400 pages moot. Then again i haven't read Hyperion Fall yet, which i most certainly plan on doing, so maybe I'm wrong. Still, it left me closing the book somewhat less enthused than when i started. This was my first Simmons book, and he won me over, and despite my somewhat harsh review, this book was definitley worth the price, and i will definitely read the series. If nothing else, this is a fresh approach to the genre, and for that he must be commended.	2004-05-07

You ever listen to a child tell a story...&quot;and then he did this, and then he did this, and then everyone suddenly had invisible forcefields&quot;...I seriously doubt there was any type of outline for this. It just jumps from one random moment to the next. The characters are annoying, and the twists were ridiculously improbable.

But the novel was slow and unimaginative. The characters are well developed, the dialogue is great, but the story just sort of flops about like a fish out of water, not knowing what to do next. The real meat of the story is between the priest and the demons, and even between the priest and the professor, but we're forced to read about some guy who has telekenetic powers and sees shadowy demons and blah blah blah. The priest story should have taken precedent. Still, he's a gifted writer and I've read a lot worse. For my money, pick up Midnight Nation, it's a much better romp through the world of the undead.	2004-01-02

Why make an almost carbon copy of a better book? <br />Still, it's lansdale, and it's good. It's no Drive In Omnibus, but it beats a lot of what's out there.

I read it because everyone gave it such high praise, but i found it a bit boring. The only other Follet I've read is Jackdaws, and that was vastly better than this. To a degree, his research is interesting, he describes the setting very well, and if you're into cathedrals and the middle ages and knights and political power plays, then you may enjoy it. But the language is jerky and unimaginative. The characters were a little 2 dimensional, Brother Philip being the exception. I loved jackdaws because every triumph was met with a new twist (break into the room only to find the enemy standing there, that kind of thing) but i got the impression he just wrote this without knowing where it was going. I think if he'd lost a couple hundred pages (it's about 1000) it would have been a lot better.	2003-10-28

No, it's not really horror, but i don't think it's all that bad either. My recomendation would be to read Ghosts first, it's much better and scarier. Then read this in the way you'd watch a comedy after watching a horror movie, a way to settle down.	2003-09-12

I came across my copy of this recently and started rereading it. Man, did I miss the point the first time around. Murphy isn't trying to be funny so much as he's illustrating the importance of film in society. As well as illustrating the negatives, so much as there can be some. So I'm giving this four stars on my second read, and if you love film as much as Murphy does, do yourself a favor and read the book. At times its amusing, at times it's poignant, and at times it just makes you think.	2003-09-12

Granted, Lansdale's other novles about monsters and boogie men are fantastically entertaining, but The Bottoms puts him up there with literature's greatest writers. It's beautifully written and the characters are well drawn and complex like none I've seen in a long time.  The mystery is easy to solve, and I blame part of that on the time we live in and the fact the news isn't afraid to report what a decade ago was somehwat unmentionable. But aside from the mystery, it's the coming of age story that blew me away. When i read the part about young Harry listening to his father cry because he couldn't protect his black friend against an angry Klan mob, and realizing that his father was not a protector and provider but a simple man with feelings, I knew this book was one I'd recomment to all my friends. Well deserving of it's Edgar winning prize of Best Novel of the Year, The Bottoms deserves to go down inthe annals of literrary history.  Though i recommend his other stories for their sheer enterataining value, everybody should read The Bottoms for its piognant theme...you never really know who a person is until you see them at their finest and their worst.	2003-06-12
US	49897128	RRT8MFKY5R38P	0345294270	710004252	Off Season	Books	5	52	58	N	N	Best Slasher Fiction ever	Having never read Ketchumn before this, i expected the same lame \\"horror\\" type novel that King and Koontz pump out, the kind that are more often dry and boring than terrifying. But, I have never  in all my life of reading (and I'm a magazine editor) experienced anything so feral and psychologically horrifying as Off Season. It was soo unrelentlessy grotesque in its depiction of human dismemberment and cannabalism I couldn't help but become the person staring at the dead bodies beside the car crash. I simply could not look away. There were a few passages that nearly made me nauseous...and that is unheard of in fiction. I can't remember ever caring about the main characters in another novel as much as i cared about Dan and Nick and Marjie. Off Season is written so well, and paced with such ferocity, i felt right there beside the characters. Every scrape they got, every bite from a rabid child they received, i received too. And every battle they won, I won too. When was the last time you actually cheered audibly for a hero in a book? What will set this novel apart form any other horror novel out there is the sheer honest approach it espouses in its evil. This book is not for the feint of heart. But, absolutley, for those who want to test their will in hell.	2003-04-11
US	49897128	R1OO1CZIEPD1HY	0060936142	826438700	Mike Nelson's Mind over Matters	Books	5	1	2	N	Y	Funniest book I've ever read	hands down, the funniest thing I've ever read. My girlfriend kicked me out of bed because I was laughin so hard I was shaking the bed and keeping her awake. I would read it on my luch break and I swear people must have thought I was having an epileptic fit. Mike Nelson hit's the truth of our culture so squarely on the head it's almost frighteneing. Proabably this works better for males, as we can identify with school yard fights and moving couches, but still, I am goin to recommend this to everyone i know who needs a laugh.	2003-03-12

I highly recommend if you're thinking about goin there, or even traveling in general. It's puts you right in the mind of the adventurer, and more than anything, lets you realize the world around you.	2003-03-12

I don't feel like getting into an indepth review, but i'll put it this way. If you liked Dune, or Star Wars, or Lord of the Flies, or even Startship Troopers (the book),then you'll love this book. It's very well written, with engaging characters and great environlment, loads of battle scenes and quick pacing. So read it, okay.	2003-03-12
US	49897128	R18SXP4655IPDH	0312421265	101663882	The Good German	Books	4	0	1	N	N	best of the Kanon series	Of the three novels Kanon has written, this is by far the best. He keeps getting better with every novel. The characters have depth, the settings are vivid, the dialogue is great, so natural. Mystery story aside, the real meat of the book lies in its who-to-blame frustration, its search for a moral code that makes sense. It would have been easy to make me either agree or disagree with the \\"Supposed Nazis\\",  but I felt sorry for them at times. Knowing they had done horrible things to their fellow human beings, but pitying them at the same time, because they were forced to do as much. Or were they? Could they have made a choice? What would I have done in their situation? Wow, a hard thing to pull off but Kanon managed it well. if you like a good mystery and love the WWII genre, most definitely read this book.	2002-09-10
US	49897128	R3FKTTXZ1MBQYC	9994553518	697484002	Ghosts	Books	4	5	6	N	N	for those who don't scare easy	I heard a lot about this book but only recently obtained a copy as it is out of print. I read it at night in bed with a little book light and every time the house creaked my heart jumped. it doesn't rely on monsters and blood and guts, but pure psychological terror. You'll keep asking yourself, what was that noise? did I just see someone outside my window? why is the cat avoiding the bedroom closet? The ending was not bad, no big overture or anything, more realistic than other novels. My one complaint was that toward the end of the book the author started to write from the ghosts point of view and that annoyed me. It was more fun wondering if the characters were going insane. But I still would recommend it to anyone who likes horror and can't stand the type of thing King and Koontz write about.	2002-04-18
US	49897128	R3EL4DEZKGMK67	0440225345	217485583	The Prodigal Spy	Books	4	1	1	N	N	great spy yarn	I fell in love with Kanon's dialogue in Los Alamos but found myself ignoring the love story and wanting more mystery. The Prodigal Spy was much more to my liking in this respect. The dialogue is great, not cheesy and mundane like most books these days. The story between father and son is gripping. Normally I'm not interested in this type of story, family redemption and so on, but this book somehow made it not only work, but made it interesting. The cold war setting is well layed out, and his descriptions of Prague and its Big Brother way of life are eerily well written. It's this middle section of the book, when the protagonist visits his father in Prague and is accused of murder, when he must deal with lack of freedom in a communist state and find a way out of his mess, that really proves Kanon's ability to tell a great story. The ending seemed too quick paced, and sadly it was pretty easy to figure out who the killer was(the last five pages do contain a nice twist though). All in all I highly recomend this to anyone who likes a great history oriented story, and of course, a good old fashion spy yarn.	2002-03-25
