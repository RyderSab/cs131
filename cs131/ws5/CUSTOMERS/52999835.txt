Certainly \\"One for the Money\\" is the best of this series by far, and the series has taken a decided downturn, with \\"Ten\\" being just awful in that Stephanie turned into a, well, something that Amazon probably won't allow me to say. I actually disliked her. Poor Ranger and Morelli! <br /> <br />Now Stephanie's back in fine form. Though the romantic subplot is STILL on hold (will things never change? What's the reason for this? Unchanging conditions = boring), hints are dropped that perhaps #12 will concentrate on Ranger and his secrets. Here's hoping. (At this point I'm rooting for Tank, just to get something different.) <br /> <br />We get a solid plot and a DIFFERENT twist on Stephanie's life as a bounty hunter -- hey, she's actually picking up skills! -- as well as new car tricks. I applaud the depiction of Stephanie as improving and her life changing, as I don't like static series. The donut metaphor is inspired! And I love seeing Stephanie, alone of all of Evanovich's heroines over the years, beginning to eat sensibly. (Now someone help that poor dog!) <br /> <br />Unfortunately, the final three pages -- the climax, as there's no denouement AGAIN (hey, how about some emotional reaction at least?) -- seems tacked on. Without it the men would have saved Stephanie's butt AGAIN (though they do it enough to be irritating. Stephanie's the star! She's a kick-a heroine! She should get herself out of trouble!). <br /> <br />Eleven was very enjoyable right up to those final 3 pages. It gives me hope that #12 will finally see Stephanie firmly back on track!	2005-07-01

What a concept she came up with! It's very original (my god, it's even set in Canada -- Canada! I didn't know that was legal!), she's gifted it with lots of layers of complexity, and it works very well with humor. Unfortunately, the main characters (which in the beginning are primed for maximum value) lie unexploited, unexplored, and unchanging. <br /> <br />While I'm a plot person, I'm the first to agree that it's characters that drive a book and embed it into a reader's heart. <br /> <br />An editor could have pointed out the need for arcs showing the main characters' growth. An editor could have been a sounding board to decide if some of the humor really didn't hit its target, keeping the humor that did -- and there was a lot. An editor would have reminded her about the importance of clarity, as quite often people would speak or enter a scene and the reader wouldn't be privy to who it was, apparently a \\"cute\\" author mannerism that brought this reader out of the story every time. An editor might have pointed out that Hell seemed quite a mild, laughable place, which is not what I think was intended. <br /> <br />An editor could have spotted the long, loooonnng, sagging middle that resorts to a parade of shoulda-been-interesting-to-explore characters who remain for the most part walk-ons and have nothing to do with the plot. <br /> <br />Usually such a middle makes me close the book quietly somewhere around page 200 and set it on my \\"give away\\" pile, but with such a concept I knew the author surely must furnish a good ending, and she does. Very exciting! Glad I stuck around. <br /> <br />But next time, I hope the author gets a better editor. She shows wonderful talent and imagination, but it needs polishing.	2005-05-12

I bought this because I was in a mood, had more money than I usually do, and was intrigued by the portrait on the cover. I've been painting for some time now and thought that this might be a book that I'd just turn around and donate to the local library because it didn't seem like a keeper.<br /><br />Was I wrong! The author expands his simple rule (which I already knew about, of course, but only in one fashion) to cover EVERYTHING about art. I hadn't considered just how far-ranging the rule is. Was it a lightbulb moment or a \\"Duh! Of course!\\" moment? Whatever, I'm now AWARE of the rule in every aspect of my art. I now can achieve better compositions, better color, better everything.<br /><br />Immeasurably helpful! And the author uses the most wonderful paintings and demos to illustrate his points.

If you're just looking for vacation reading material, wait for this to come out in paperback, and prepare to be able to put it down whenever you need to. This is not page-turning excitement. In fact, the novel's energy varies greatly -- and it starts out dead cold. When Janet focuses in on Stephanie, the energy picks up noticeably. Fun ensues. Focus away from Steph and it's just Janet trotting out her schtick by the numbers.<br />There are some REALLY great twists!!! The villain of this book is every bit as good and menacing as the boxer from vol. 1, with the glimpse into gangs frighteningly realistic. That gave me high hopes. Towards the end Janet throws a twist our way and I thought, well, it's a repeat of an earlier book -- but okay if it works! But then it became a red herring and things fell apart.<br />The biggest sin of this book is that Stephanie doesn't win her fight. No, she has to have a man save her. And in the penultimate climax, yet another man saves her hide. In addition, now we find that Ranger has a perpetual \\"babysitter\\" patrol that keeps watch on her.<br />Is this any way to write a kick-you-know-what heroine? NO!!! And worse yet, this ending has precedent. Book 3 has Stephanie winning -- as long as Ranger backs her up. #4 is a group effort, though Steph is in the lead. Ranger saves the day in #6 and #8. Diesel pulls her fat out of the fire in that awful \\"Sugar Plum\\" book. Sheer unlikely and unprepared luck saves Steph's butt in #9, though she indeed pulls the trigger.<br />It's time Stephanie grew up, learned more about her craft, put it to use, and found some focus with her love life. She should be punished for the way she treats/teases Ranger with no real thought of ever settling with him. I lost a lot of respect for her in that department with this book.<br />Stephanie is still salvageable. I wish this book had gone back to rewrite, with the final red herring turning into a true climax with Stephanie saving the day. That wouldhave given it another half-star. Don't rehash Stephanie's character or situation! Let her move ahead, change, and WIN FOR HERSELF.	2004-07-10

There's never a definitive &quot;This is realistic landscape painting, and this over here is impressionism&quot; juxtaposition to explain exactly HOW impressionism might differ from traditional or realistic landscapes. Not sure about the &quot;contemporary realism&quot; review, since I'm not familiar with that as a specific term, but I'd have to agree that some sort of modifier on the &quot;impressionism&quot; label might be appropriate here.<br />There are a great many paintings by Whisson showcased, and most are quite nice, with a few even breathtaking. Most are done on a very small scale, the 10x12&quot; range.<br />What few step-by-step demos, or even partial demos, there are are rather pale. Many &quot;compositional plan&quot; examples are merely ghosted-back visuals of the finished painting with a grid superimposed and little explanation as to composition or positioning choices. Most &quot;tonal plans&quot; (value sketches) are just b&amp;w photos (badly screened, imho, so you can't see the patterns well) of the finished painting. Some of the all-the-way demos seem to be done after the fact, as in he started with a finished painting he wanted to demonstrate, and then did another one, this one being photographed as he did it. The results don't match. We are rarely told the why behind choices made.<br />The use of color is almost ignored entirely.<br />He does stress sketching, which is great! But if he were to redo this book, I'd advise him to do actual demos, explaining all the way as to his specific reasons for doing everything, and how this demonstrates impressionism. He should go into composition, into value determination, and most especially, into color.<br />The value of this book is the many Whisson paintings showcased and the inspiration derived from same. For &quot;how to&quot; value, I would recommendtrying to find another book.	2004-05-04

Disregard it. This book is a treasure!<br />NOT ONLY does it break composition down into 14 loose suggestions that will help you organize your paintings and bring your viewers into them, BUT it also tells you what to pack for plein air sketching, how to photograph the setting once you're there, and how to simplify, simplify, simplify and rearrange what it is you see so it will translate onto the canvas.<br />Landscape painting isn't about painting what you see. That's why God created cameras.

Exercises that make you want to rush to your easel, plus dozens of eye-catching paintings make this a primo book.

If you, like me, need to concentrate more on putting interesting patterns of value in your paintings, YOU NEED THIS BOOK.<br />Love the work displayed -- it's quite inspiring. (I'd buy it!) I wonder at the reproduction, as the text sometimes names a color and when you look at the painting, it doesn't quite look like that (like a green that looks quite blue).

This isn't as great as \\"One for the Money,\\" but it shows that perhaps the author can return to that level.<br />In this book Stephanie actually improves in her job -- hooray! She's not teetering on the edge of bankruptcy (which she'd better steer clear of if she follows through on these baby wishes!), and her friends aren't ALL over-the-top stereotypes. We get yet another new <yawn> way to bond someone (like Eight), and another attempt to show cutting-edge geek hobbies -- something that has never quite worked in the series.<br />But the humor is still there, as are the wacky (but not too wacky; I think one more person in the book had to operate at Lula levels for the lunacy to really work) secondary characters. THANK YOU for omitting the now-tired car gag and for coming up with an original new gag!<br />Fingers firmly crossed after reading this book, I can now hope that Ten will have Stephanie continuing to improve her professional image, will ease Stephanie out of her \\"straight man\\" role into at least a couple of scenes in which she's the center of the joke, will have at least a chapter's worth of steamy Ranger sex (we were cheated in Eight!) while continuing the Morelli situation, and will return to a solid, terrifying \\"ordinary\\" whodunit plot like One had.

(Shouldn't there be a horse on the cover, too?) Our heroine is a thoroughly single-minded woman with her own definite set of priorities, and our hero is wonderfully paranoid about his dotty family and reputation.<br />Though I had some quibbles about small things here and there, I noticed myself chuckling, &quot;heh heh heh&quot; quietly as the reader was let in on jokes that our hero and heroine were too busy fretting about to appreciate. Tension builds to a page-turning frenzy as each stonily refuses to give in to the other. It's increased by the pressure exerted by well-meaning people around them to bring them together.<br />Two dynamic leads and a solid plot gave me a very enjoyable afternoon's reading!	2003-04-14

Ray's heroine is size 22 and does indeed show a few weight problems that affect her life (though we're told that she exercises enough and eats well. Then why the heck is she size 22?). The story is well-plotted, well-paced, and the characters are somewhat believable, though the hero (like all the heroes in the book) is a little too subservient to or worshipful of His Woman. I'd be inclined to try another of Ms. Ray's work if it's of the same caliber as this story.<br />Alers' \\"Reunion\\" was full of superficiality. Dialogue was super-stilted, ultra-precise and totally unnatural. Narrative and characters were more concerned with how people dressed and what they drove than with showing us why we should care about the events and people of the story. I certainly didn't; I couldn't finish it. Our heroine was golly gee, a whole size 16.<br />Hill's \\"Surprise!\\" would have been a very nice little vignette with no real conflict except that the ultra-sweet hubby shows a shockingly unfeeling reaction to his wife's announcement -- and then we're still supposed to root for him? Are you kidding? The story also demonstrates that a woman isn't a real woman until she gives birth, and drives that point home by having the heroine in essence discarding the importance of her adoptive kids. Oh, she denies doing it but she does it all the same. I shuddered. I also wondered why both parents, if they'd been going to doctors for years way back when about their little problem, didn't know whose body was the one not cooperating. That didn't make sense. Heroine was twenty pounds overweight sans baby, doctor tells her she's just a little overweight, and yet her size is listed as 18. Uh huh.<br />Jackson's \\"Bare Essentials\\" had a number of editing problems in addition to a schlock ending that spoiled a promising beginning. The text makes the heroine seem gargantuan. Turns out she's a \\"full-size14 figure.\\" Is that listed as \\"large\\" in any clothing store besides the Bulemia Fashion Outlet? Sex is treated unnecessarily at length and quite graphically. It doesn't fit in with the rest of the prose and cheapens the story. May I recommend \\"The Joy of Writing Sex\\" to the author? Don't change your style just because you're writing a sex scene.<br />Throughout the book the plus-sizes (even when they aren't that plus) are treated as if they aren't the fault of the people involved. All heroines exercise religiously and eat (often they just nibble) sensibly; all heroines blame their size on heredity. I think that if a little more reality were invoked (think Dr. Phil, folks) the characters would flesh out (sorry) better and come more to life on the page. Of course this is fantasy. All heroines in this book are super-rich, bursting with health, and attracting gorgeous men, etc etc. But in addition to that fantasy we could have real, breathing, large-sized people dealing with life and the problems of being a large-sized person -- and then winding up getting a kick out of it all, as well.	2003-04-10

You can count on Sabrina Jeffries to deliver strong-willed Regency heroines (and heroes) who demand more to their lives than just sitting around and sipping tea while gossipping about the ton.<br />Our heroine is a reformer, passionate in her mission, and our hero's noble but secret mission could snag her efforts and the lives of her young charges. Secondary plots (one of them just a tad obvious, sorry) derive from our heroine's mission and enrich the storyline by giving us an engaging cast that surrounds h/h.<br />Jeffries writes some of the sexiest scenes in the biz, full not only of heat but of emotion. She never lets these scenes overpower her plots. They enhance this one wonderfully and if your toes haven't contentedly curled before, they will afterward.<br />I'm not quite sure how the front cover or the title ties into the book, though. Both make it seem (imo) as if this were some kind of harem setting when it's all quite improperly-properly British. Ah, marketing departments! At least we're rid of all the \\"Lord\\" and \\"Love\\" confusion of earlier series. The back cover is quite reminiscent of \\"A Dangerous Love\\" and \\"After the Abduction,\\" but is the best of the three.<br />Recently I've reread a few of Jeffries' previous works.

US	52999835	R1A9VRPIXAMT0	031298328X	650761638	Full Tilt (Max Holt)	Books	2	2	2	N	N	Knight Rider redux	Janet's got the basis for an interesting series: a wacky, inventive genius, a daring newspaper reporter, and a computer with a personality built into a car. Wait -- that last part seems familiar. A lot of this seems familiar. We get embarrassing stereotype after embarrassing stereotype, compounded with a computer-car that seems straight out of the old TV series (which I didn't watch, so I'm making some assumptions). The leads who should be vibrant are instead flat and lifeless. In fact Our Heroine at times does things that place her squarely in the Too Stupid To Live category. I thought the depiction of the flaming gay guy was particularly demeaning, especially when he suddenly became ultra-John Wayne after a concussion.<br />Where are the original characters one expects from a book with \\"Evanovich\\" on the cover? Oh, okay, so her Plum series is getting bogged down in stereotypes, too. It didn't used to be that way.<br />As for the book itself, it took me three full chapters before I felt as if I were interested enough to keep reading. On the whole, it's your average romance (with a rushed ending that didn't make much sense characterwise). Why two stars instead of three, then? Because the name \\"Evanovich\\" is on the cover. The quality of this book SHOULD be better. I probably won't pick up the next in this series. Why should I? The characters are completely uncompelling.	2003-02-21

I had to FORCE myself to make it through this book. There's no compelling hook, no conflict that incites more than a mild anxiety in the characters, and the first 95 pages AT LEAST could be dropped without harming the novel. Not having to read through those 95 pages would probably help it.<br />Even if Ms. Lay was unfamiliar with WW when she started this project (as referred to in her dedication) she should have become aware of the times in WW's many eras when WW not only had character but teemed with life. She was vibrant, outrageous, optimistic, gutsy... Of course, for the past few years she's been bland as mayonnaise, but that was no reason to use the mayonnaise version for this book.<br />Novels about characters operating in other media are a time to get in there and dig through what makes them tick. Mayonnaise does not tick. WW's Amazons should not come off as fussy Victorian-style maiden aunts who are thrown into a tizzy at the very idea of a battle. WW's enemies should not be mindless drones who walk this way and that, and when they're done they do it again and again until you just wish they'd walk into the sea and never return.<br />The Amazons should be professional in their soldiering and devout in their peacemaking. WW is measured by her enemies so those should be cunning and powerful with plans to take over the world that actually make a little sense and seethe with danger.<br />A superhero venue would seem to indicate a hard-action story. This was a chance to show off WW and her venue to the ultimate, without even the limitations of printed illustrations to slow the writer down. What we got was boring, repetitive interior ramblings that exemplified \\"tell, don't show.\\" If I'd been the editor on this, I would have sent it back at proposal stage for a complete re-think.<br />There are some funny lines, but not many. Some flashes of poety -- again, not many. The descriptions of the fish areinteresting, but I didn't pick this up for fish.<br />What age group was this written for? The majority of it was written simplistically, as if for grade-schoolers (wouldn't the JL series be more appropriate for such a style?), but the concept of rape was brought up again and again, and the words \\"whore\\" and \\"slut\\" were used, which I don't consider kid material.<br />Why did the two women in the novel constantly go around kissing all the men on the cheek to show their approval of them? How very, very strange.<br />I wanted an exciting adventure starring the dynamic Wonder Woman -- the personification of empowerment. Instead I got a book I had to struggle through and certainly never enjoyed.	2003-02-07

After reading the excerpt from this in the last book I realized that this was going to be a fantasy, so when I picked up the book I kept in mind that this was not set in the real Stephanie Plum universe, but in an alternate. Perhaps it would even turn out to be a dream. A Christmas yarn starring Stephanie Plum and her crazy family and friends could be pretty darned hilarious.<br />Stephanie's supporting cast are all here doing their crazy supporting cast thing, and there's even a progression (if you can call it that) on one front (is there anyone as stupid as Stephanie's formerly perfect sister?). This book would have been a short story if it hadn't been for Janet's army of characters, each (except Ranger) trotted out on cue.<br />But they aren't enough to hold the book together. This is indeed a fantasy, but someone should have told both Janet and her editor that fantasies in particular need to be set in a world with certain rules. It must conform to its own interior logic, otherwise you lose the reader's suspension of disbelief. When you set up some kind of wishy-washy-not-sure-what's-going-on and get a character like Deisel who can do anything when it's needed, it becomes deus ex machina, one of the lowest tricks a writer can pull.<br />My biggest disappointment was that once again, Stephanie doesn't live up to her role as hero and complete the case. Janet, please stop falling in love with your male romantic leads and let Stephanie once again be the star! By now she should also have progressed in her abilities. She should not still be starving (yet able to bribe people? and buy loads of presents?) and clueless.	2002-11-19

The original 1989 Full House (by Steffie Hall) was a ho-hum romance, 179 pages, in which boy met girl, boy lost -- no, he didn't. It was just boy met girl, boy got girl. There was no conflict but there were some interesting characters: Eugene (in this new book renamed Max), Deedee, and Billie herself, as well as some good comic turns.<br />This new book adds an ex-fiancee, increases a one-mention character to secondary status, and throws in a darker plot complication VERY late in the book. Yet still the book lacks any kind of real conflict to hold it together and set it above the mainstream. Pages have been expanded, the late complication has been added, and the occasional insubstantial scene that makes you go, \\"huh?\\" pops up (the dress shop owner??) (these seem to be there just to increase page count). A co-author has also been added -- but her name doesn't appear anywhere on the cover. I feel sorry for her and a little irritated at Janet for taking the credit (though this could well be an editorial decision).<br />Like the last Stephanie Plum book, this one falls completely apart at the 3/4 mark. The world suddenly shifts into a dimension where rational people act in utterly irrational ways. (Take the bachelor party scene, which in the first version had Billie jumping out of the cake fully clothed and merrily waving a rolling pin at Nick, whom she knew wasn't interested in the party. Compare it to this unfunny and out-of-character version.) (Or take the busload of people and carload of wrestlers and see where they go at the end of this book -- it made absolutely no sense.)<br />Marion Zimmer Bradley is one of my favorite fantasy authors, but when her name became big enough the quality of her books plummeted. Perhaps (as another reviewer has suggested) editors just don't bother once they've got The Big Name on the cover.<br />If this book could get a rewrite, it deserved a true rewrite, a tearing apart and restructuring. The save-the-wilderness plot could have served as a basis of conflict, complicated by the existing darker subplot. Billie and Nick could have had a real conflict between themselves instead of smooth sailing. Janet enjoys wrestling (or at least wrestlers); couldn't we have gotten into them some more for a lot of fun?<br />If this is a rewrite, shouldn't it be better than the first version? If it's not, why not just re-release the original?	2002-10-17

I laughed my way though most of it, was infuriated by the US's approach to conservancy, sat breathless as Bill's companion became lost at the end, felt superior because even on my worst day my diet is better than Bill's on the trail, etc. etc. The book is absolutely evocative and pretty darned honest. Now I want to join the Sierra Club, hike a bit of the trail (maybe the pretty, easy part in VA, once my heel spur goes away)... and pick up another Bryson book.	2002-10-04

Such fun to begin a new Stephanie Plum book, especially when I discover that it's not like #7, which was a mere rewrite of its two preceding volumes. The pace is brisk, the humor is terrific (even though the handcuff gag needed to be cut by two times; humor and threes may be a cliche, but it's a true cliche), and though there was yet another person introduced who wanted to be a bounty hunter, there was only one, and most of the others have moved on (thankfully) to other vocations. The over-the-top characters were kept on firm reins, and I'll be forever grateful for that. Love the characters, but I don't love them running pell-mell over everything!<br />The plots kept me absolutely engrossed until almost the end. Then all three plots ended badly. The romance plot that has been building for eight books -- EIGHT BOOKS -- poof! gone in a couple of paragraphs!!! We readers deserved at the very least a page more, Janet. Argh, and not in a funny way. The subplot of the guy with the handcuffs: what? This is how it ends? Without tying into the main plot, without his wife killing him, without Stephanie triumphant? And the main plot: WHAT???? This is how it ends? No. Absolutely unacceptable.<br />Stephanie has been in this dangerous business for what, three years her time? And now she's in a book that has multiple plots that she isn't able to solve any of? The magic of Ms. Plum is that she's a bumbler, yes, but she'll bumble her way to solving things and bringing the bad guys to justice. In this book she has to rely constantly on men to replenish her equipment supplies and to bring the crooks to justice.<br />This is not what I buy a Stephanie Plum book for. Janet, you MUST make Stephanie more adept at her job in at least some small way, or she starts to teeter to the Too Stupid To Live borderline. You MUST have her solve her own problems, even if she bungles her way to do so.<br />I look forward to seeing her a non-Loser in her next book!	2002-06-28

A fabulous book not only on writing romantic comedy movies but on writing, period. In particular, a romance writer of any medium would find this invaluable. <br />Mr. Mernit examines the basic components of story and character, but also provides fascinating insight to such subjects as theme. End-chapter exercises are unusually helpful and enlightening. <br />Critiques of a few movies show just how they accomplished what they did. (The examination of &quot;Tootsie&quot; is amazing!) I appreciated the breakdown of how romantic comedy in the movies has evolved through the years and am now collecting many of the titles listed in the book that I've never seen. (The recent AFI list on romantic movies is also a good source for more study.)<br />This book is on my shelf now right next to Syd Fields and Debra Dixon. I will certainly be referring to it again and again in the years that come.	2002-06-19

The sudden realization at the end seems rather obvious to the reader, and indeed seems to have been how the book led us throughout most of the narrative. Were we suposed to have been surprised?<br />There are some episodes and characters whose potential fall through, leaving a sense of a hole (the ex-hubby, the car chase -- why?). Though they're there to throw us off the real track, there still needs to be more explanation for why they happened, why they were needed.<br />Yes, the nurse talk got too thick at times but it was fascinating all the same (I love the term &quot;gomer&quot;), and Timmie's often uncaring attitude towards her patients was off-putting. This might be just layering of character, but I wanted to like Timmie. She was caring but uncaring, and she knew a little too much about everything. But her situation was one that gripped me, and the relationship between her father and her was a fascinating one to explore.<br />Her name, though: Timothy Leary-Parker. It brought me out of the story every time it was mentioned, even just as &quot;Timmie.&quot; Too much, too cute.<br />Good writing otherwise, and like I said, the Alzheimers angle put quite a fascinating spin on the whole thing.	2002-06-19

They're always clever with interesting characters and situations, a lot of humor, sparkling dialogue, sultry sex (some of the best stuff out there), and a million unexpected plot twists before you get to the ending. This one had an additional plus: I'd forgotten how pleased SJ had been to announce that she'd tied the end of her \\"Love\\" trilogy into the first book of her \\"Lord\\" trilogy, and there it was.<br />Speaking of which, a mammoth GOLD STAR for whichever editor finally figured out that all those \\"Lords\\" and \\"Loves\\" titles were too doggone confusing!<br />I could not put \\"After the Abduction\\" down. (Pass the Visine, please!) It's a wiggling-your-toes, giggling-at-each-new-catastrophe kind of story with a wonderful subplot as well. This is one of those \\"keeper\\" books you hear about now and then. Buy it.	2002-06-19

The first one varied widely in its pacing and the writing style; this one has a smooth pace and is consistently written with an ear tuned to the music of language.<br />Unfortunately, the characters in \\"To Burn\\" are beautiful but not sympathetic. They spend a huge amount of time inside their own heads. I'd rather see them doing something that would make me begin to like them.<br />Logic holes abound. Our heroine professes to be Christian but her sporadic observations of the religion only scratch the surface when the plot deems it convenient and even more, quite unforgiveably, result in a sudden deus ex machina for the ending, a sure sign of lazy plotting and possible disregard for the reader.<br />In the future if I pick up another Dain novel, I'd like to see her give us real motivations for her characters. Why does the hero linger here? It's never convincingly explained. I'd like to see her set her novels in the real time, where people had to work to survive instead of loll about -- especially when their world has just been destroyed. I'd like to see the dialogue written as if real people could have said it. Barbarians shouldn't speak like  college professors. I'd like to see logic holes cleaned up: how is it that one person in this novel can learn fluent Latin from a year's stay in a very confined and limited environment, but the heroine's pitiful grasp of Saxon varies from scene to scene and never improves despite being surrounded by Saxons and put in a situation where it is to her advantage to learn what they're saying?<br />Most of all I'd like to see characters whom I could care about and not people who seem to still reside only on the flat surface of a romance novel cover. (Although the gentleman on this book's cover is a fine sight to see. Too bad he was posed so awkwardly.)	2002-05-20
US	52999835	R1B2O18XZP49D0	0515132764	92530279	Fantasy	Books	3	6	9	N	N	Wonderful Sabrina Jeffries story!	Sabrina Jeffries knows how to write a page-turner with vibrant characters who are truly motivated to do what they must. Her \\"Widow's Auction\\" is a wild Regency that kept me enthralled and captivated by the circumstances of the main characters. (But how the heck does a lady sneak out of an upper-class hotel while wearing a mask?)<br />Minger's \\"Mr. Speedy\\" needed more room to work up a steam. As it was every aspect was too quickly dealt with, exposing the superficial instead of delving deeper for real meaning. A fifteen-minute, cliched conversation leads to lifelong soul commitment? (Large breasts can be sufficiently wrapped to fool a roomful of men?) The humor of the seminar needed to be milked more as well, and leaving out the same kind of symbol that \\"As You Were Sleeping\\" used (there it worked because it was used on a multitude of levels) would have helped, too. It all had potential but needed to spread out to develop it.<br />Feehan's \\"The Awakening\\" utilized a pitifully weak heroine and overbearing hero and combined it with prose that repeated itself in an attempt at mystery and eroticism. I'd like to have seen a plot in there, but the two characters were too busy lusting: him after her, and she after herself; to busy themselves with an actual story that I could care about. I couldn't finish this one.<br />Similarly, \\"Luisa's Desire,\\" though rich with marvellous prose, was laid over a non-existent structure. Like many vampire stories of late (cf the Anita Blake series, which I have given up), this character was too busy being Perfect and Serene to bother searching for any kind of personal motivation. If she'd been truly anxious to reach her goal I would have kept reading beyond the third chapter.	2002-04-22

I'd go back and check out the titles that gave her that status instead of reading this book.<br />Very weak characters, an obvious mystery, too-convenient plot devices every other page, cheap shocks that make you feel stupid when you find out what they are, characters that literally fall into the hospital room so they can spill their guts -- or confessions -- to our bed-ridden mystery solver... And someone has the gall to compare her to Miss Marple. (She blushes modestly when they do so.)<br />Search a little farther on Amazon and I'm sure you'll find something that is worth your time.

This book gives a very good overview of foods available, how they were eaten, table manners, etc.; I just wish it went into just a little more detail. But that's not really what it's about; it's for presenting actual medieval recipes, and it certainly does give a lot of them with modern equivalents.<br />But what did people eat for breakfast? How widespread was corn or oats? What other kinds of grains were used? What were sub-regional specialties? How much was wine thinned with water? How long could a wine last in those days before it went bad? How often did people get food poisoning?<br />For what this book was written for, it's an excellent one. For a writer, it's a very good starting point.	2002-02-14

This was possibly the best reference I used since I can't go over there to check out the place in person, and the people I know who have been there haven't been able to give me much information.<br />This book recounts incredible detail about the countryside and regional dishes, availability of shopping, hotels, and tourist spots, and there are little humorous stories about some of the stops along the way. The detailed accounts of each lock along the canals is absolutely amazing and I'm sure quite helpful for those who actually find themselves there. <br />Unfortunately, the canal system of France was started after my book was set, so I couldn't use the lock and interesting layovers along the canal info, but...<br />Now I want to go to France and cruise all these fascinating rivers and canals! I'm afraid that's going to cost considerably more than this book does. Until then, I'll continue to peruse the book and dream.	2002-02-14

Out of curiosity and because I'd been FIRMLY told by many that I would love it, I bought this book and tried to read it. It's very easy to put down and forget, but I kept trying to make it through, hoping that The Magic would soon set in and captivate me. (Besides, I have the second book waiting to be read.) What I wound up doing on page 625 is giving up and skipping through the rest of the book hoping that something would pop up to warrant me spending a few more hours with it.<br />Drama is conflict, and the conflict in this book is finished 1/3 of the way through. I thought that another conflict would start, or perhaps build on the first, but it never did. The characters talk and talk and talk (usually about something that's happened in the past) and wander through their lives without seeming purpose.<br />The character of Jamie is certainly interesting enough, but an interesting character is not enough to sustain a book, particularly one over 800 pages. The situation of time travel is handled well, but after the first third, it disappears as a plot device.<br />The author certainly knows how to deliver vibrant description and dialect, but that isn't enough to sustain interest. I require a book to have a plot: that means conflict, motivations, goals. This book did not have these, at least not beyond the first third. I'm afraid I won't be reading that second book in the series.	2002-02-01

Anne Gracie has written a sparkling story that had me laughing so hard I actually slapped my knee -- at several points in the book! -- and reaching for the Kleenex at the end. Her heroine is a surprising character who pulls the unexpected at least a half-dozen times. I loved her unique attitude and the fact that she was portrayed as intelligent and professional. How often do you find that in any book any more? I just SO enjoyed this story and the great sparks between hero and heroine. You're going on my list of authors to watch for, Ms. Gracie!<br />Yes, I was captivated by this second novel -- after nearly putting the book down permanently halfway through the &quot;Kiss that Cowboy!&quot; story. Unfortunately, the heroine here is inept at everything except looking good in tight jeans and in bed. The hero is ept at everything she lacks, as well as looking good in jeans, etc., AND running a huge ranch all by himself, no sweat. The heroine's reason for being in Texas is not a convincing one, and the plot goes from cliche to cliche, winding up at the inevitable baby epilogue. The text for the entire thing is written in a telegraphed, short-sentence style (many times just one telegraphed sentence makes an entire paragraph) that was extremely difficult to read. In the future I'd like to ask the author to work on developing a pleasing rhythm for her words and to reach for the unexpected with both characters and plot.<br />I don't like cowboys. Why did I pick this book up in the first place? Because it DIDN'T have a cartoon depicting the glory of anorexia on the cover as had been done on several Duets covers of the recent past, and I wanted to support such a move. Hurrah, Harlequin! Maybe you're getting the message after all. (But I'm so glad I got the book because of Gracie's tale!)	2001-10-25

I love the length of Duets, just right for a Friday night bubble bath-plus read for each half, but in the past writers have had problems with too complicated stories for the length or not complicated enough, and the humor has sometimes been just too low for my tastes.<br />This book was just right. The characters were fully fleshed out, competent professionals that I could respect and whose sparks and complications sounded real enough. Oh sure, there were a couple of too-cutesy bits (the strip tease???) but they were disposed of soon enough.<br />I liked the situations, I liked the chemistry between both couples, I liked the smart, crisp writing that refused to let me put down the book.<br />Ms. Drew, I definitely will keep an eye out for future books by you!	2001-10-18

The plot rises and takes off from page one, only pausing to linger over the intriguing ruffian-turned-gentleman, Daniel Brennan. Their mission is dire and just as important as the romance.<br />The characters spark fire between each other and there are layers to them that get peeled away as the book progresses. Unlike the other SJ books I've read, the heroines of this trilogy don't have a real profession, but they never settle for sitting around and drinking tea. The setting seems very real, especially the bed bugs! Though two other characters intrude on the book (they only get a few pages, so it's not much of an intrusion), the prose otherwise fascinated me and kept me anxiously turning pages until the end. I can hardly wait for the final volume in the series! (\\"A Groovy Kind of Love?\\"  :^D ) (Oh, WHY must they title these books so like each other?)	2001-09-30

The writing itself is very good, quite descriptive with dialogue that for the most part was snappy, but the characterization and plots are one-dimensional. The men have more substance to them than the female leads. If you liked the kind of extremely light comedy \\"Three's Company\\" dealt with, you'll like these two offerings. The main joke seems to be clothing falling off or someone not realizing that she's naked as she deals with other people. Women seem to be quite the helpless little things. (Early twenties, natural blondes, buxom model figures and they can't get dates? Come ON...)<br />The heroines are the kind who see a good-looking man and their brains stop functioning -- for weeks on end. I would have liked to have these two come in with a little more on the ball smarts-wise and personality-wise. They're both working women, but the jobs seem more like window-dressing, like something they can jot down on a resume but aren't really interested in or don't need. We do get to see the second twin cooking for a living, but she doesn't seem to do any preparation for her job, cooks only foods that can supply double-entendres, and fights Management briefly for a chance to cook quick, healthy foods... and then when she wins her argument, does not do so.<br />I'd love to see what the author could do -- as I said, the writing itself is good -- if she had a fully-dimensional character to play with and didn't feel she had to deliver such drawn-out slapstick. Sparks flew during a lot of the romantic scenes; keep that in your future writing! Keep the wacky relatives and friends, too. And the gorgeous guys? You did very well with them here as they oozed testosterone, so give us more! Just don't make them start spilling their emotions; as a rule, guys don't do that.<br />A word about the cover, which depicts two blondes in the final stages of anorexia (with one pulling a non-standard hand gesture; check proper finger positioning, please!). With woman's image within the media so grossly distorted these days and so many women feeling they have to follow suit, I feel that this is an improper image to depict, especially on a book directed to women. Harlequin, please desist and put a few more pounds on the women on your covers, at least to Hollywood-slim normals and not showing death's door bulemia. I've noticed Duets putting out two anorexic covers of late -- and both books had to do with slightly OVERWEIGHT women. Three strikes and I won't be buying any more Duets.	2001-09-30

Munger is a five-star writer, but this story that revolves around tobacco is one I couldn't get into for the subject matter. It also involves a poor little rich girl, which is a plotline that's never appealed to me, not when the girl's old enough to change her own life.<br />But the plot is a solid one, the characters varied and real and mean when they need to be. Casey Jones is a great lead character. I worry about her drinking (and driving) and eating habits. 170 pounds of muscle? Tell that one to the guy behind the Krispy Kreme counter, Case. And she's got a fascinating romantic lead in this volume. (So glad to see he stuck around for at least one more book!)<br />Of the four Munger books I've read so far, this is the only one that really didn't grab and hold me until I couldn't put it down... but I still give it four stars for tension and style.	2001-07-17

It's fun to see him narrowing his focus on her while she boldly pushes him away.<br />The aunt's romantic subplot seemed rather quick; it would have been nice if it had been developed more. And the brother's was thrown on, clashing uncomfortably with the rest of the book and involving some improbable events. Poor brother! His sister makes all kinds of decisions that should have been his. No, I think the brother needed a little more work in this. He needed to be more than just a Gimmick.<br />But the clash between hero and heroine are what make this book quite enjoyable. Two great egos flail at each other and stir up a whole bunch of sparks, both of anger and of romance. I look forward to reading more by the author.	2001-07-17

Katy Munger was recommended to me because I love Janet Evanovich's books. Not as over-the-top as Evanovich, this book had its share of wit but combined it with a tight mystery plot and a horde of fascinating secondary characters. A writing workshop lecturer once told me: every character in your book thinks they're the star of it. Well, every character in this book COULD be the star of their own story because they're so wonderfully crafted and intriguing.<br />Even if the ending stretched out overlong, I didn't mind because it gave us the conclusions for each character's story, and by that time I'd come to care about what happened to them.<br />Casey Jones is a fascinating character, a little too much on the yang side at the beginning but who softens up during the course, a woman who makes mistakes but learns from them; smart and sexy, confident and not twenty-one. We care what happens to her. We care about the case she's working on and the people she's working for.<br />And it's all set right around my house! I was THRILLED to see landmarks of North Carolina's Research Triangle throughout the book, adding layers of our area's peculiar flavor to an already eccentric viewpoint.<br />So I'm here on Amazon to snarf up some more Casey Jones books. You go, Katy Munger! One question to you and Evanovich: how can your heroines eat so much and not gain weight???	2001-07-07

They are quick, handy reading.<br />&quot;Dan All Over Again&quot; was filled with very funny parts, but I would have liked a some seriousness inserted (besides just in the sex scenes) because too much cute is just too much. And I would have liked more conflict. Other than that, the situation was primed for comedy and the two lead characters followed through. Nicely written; I look forward to seeing more from the author as long as she doesn't go overboard (as some of her characters do on occasion in this book).<br />&quot;The Mountie Steals a Wife&quot; was not what I'd call a comedy, but it sure kept my attention! It reminded me of Janet Evanovich's Alaska romance book way back when, which I've always loved. Interesting heroine and hero as well as friends, plus a case to be solved. I was disappointed to see the solution posed so obviously, but when the story characters also saw the obviousness, I stomached it better. Duets are short books, after all; can't draw out the secondary plot. The author could pay more attention to her sentence structure in places: lots of &quot;he verb, he verb, he verb&quot; stuff going on a few pages of the book (not that many, though). But quite well-written otherwise. I resisted putting it down for the night. And (gad) the vivid description and atmosphere almost makes me want to visit Whitehorse!<br />Sorry, but the cover artist's work this volume isn't to my tastes. Although I like cartoon covers, the depiction of the heroine as anorexic (she's only supposed to have skinny legs) with a neck a mile long did not appeal to me, nor did the almost matchingly-skinny guy. Cartoon: good. Skinny or less: bad (unless the characters are such within the book).	2001-07-05

This one does not disappoint in that it delivers a hilarious string of vignettes involving the strange and shady peoples of Stephanie's acquaintance. Hooray that everyone wasn't gathered into one scene for an over-the-top slapstick sketch (as was done in one previous book). But would it be possible, Janet, that in book Number Eight you (1) show us Stephanie. She IS the star of the series; I missed getting into her head this time. (2) You do away with the Joyce-is-a-bounty-hunter idea. It didn't work the first time, and it has never worked since. A tiny bit of Joyce is great. More Joyce is not. (3) You get away from the funeral home. The same joke done, what, three? four? times gets stale. (5) Show us Stephanie improving in her job. As time goes by and she gets worse and worse, the impression is that she's stupid, and I'm sure you don't want your readers to think that! And (5), you give us about a hundred more pages not only of Stephanie, but of good, solid plot like in book number one. Oh, and (6): about that deja vu ending... <br />But as a read in and of itself, the book kept me laughing at its language, its concepts, and the dwellers of the Burg. Evanovich writes the funniest stuff out there. There's a lot of sexual tension, too -- thank you! And perfect Sister finally shows her face. This isn't the best Plum book, but it's definitely not the worst. More plot, more Stephanie, less deja vu for next time, Janet, please! (And what the heck does &quot;Seven Up&quot; mean here?)<br />One last note: isn't it odd that today, the day after the book went on sale, there are two used copies being offered on Amazon?	2001-06-21
US	52999835	R22XIJKCYJRGF7	0380812967	239720478	The Indiscretion	Books	4	6	6	N	N	An excellent choice for summer reading	If you like to read just to savor the words, this book is for you. Its prose is lyrical and sensuous as we peer into the minds of our hero and heroine. They don't talk as much as I prefer, but Ivory's lush use of language to show their emotions and their world is worth the trip. For the first time I feel an urge to travel to England if just to see the moors. <br />The first half of the book proceeds rather slowly because it's so intricate, but the last half speeds up nicely. Yes, there are some places where the hero talks in romantic hero man-talk, which no man in the world would be caught dead speaking, and the epilogue -- well, why it's even there is a complete mystery to me. In a recent writing workshop, Jennifer Crusie jokingly told us that if we wrote prologues or epilogues to our books, we would burn in Hell. This book's epilogue is an example of why not to do one; it continues a narrative that had already been satisfactorily resolved and introduces characters who have nothing to do with the story (if they're to be used in future books, use them in future books and not this one) and generally confuses the reader. So stop reading right before the epilogue and you'll be quite content with a passionate love story and two unusual characters. My eyes are still throbbing from staying up half the night because I could NOT put the book down!	2001-05-26

(And frankly, this Man doesn't seem worth it.) The setting held great promise with the fascinating premise of gorilla behavior contrasted to the life of a radio relationships advisor, but unfortunately fell flat when that premise was given a simplified, saccharine and sexist coating.<br />However, Susan Peterson's entry is wonderful, well worth the price of the book and then some. Funny, romantic, heartwarming, and down-to-earth. The only negative thing about it is that it was too short and the father sub-plot was resolved off-camera, the son sub-plot was unresolved (unless the dance with the ex was supposed to signal in some way that it had been resolved), and the unusual foster family was not examined more closely.<br />That was the main problem. A great read like \\"Anchovies\\" cried out for a longer book where we could really dig into the characters of these diverse, fascinating and funny people.	2001-05-22

That doesn't mean it's not a very enjoyable read! Of course (it's Crusie!) it's very funny and yes, a tad predictable, but the characters are great, engaging, warm, and people whom I'd love to know. The sexual tension is fabulous, and many of the members of my writing group just have to say &quot;mashed potatoes&quot; to each other to start a wave of laughter.<br />Some books you look back on and say, &quot;I wasted x hours reading that!&quot; Hours with this book will be ones you'll remember fondly.

I love when even the villains have redeeming characteristics. I love humor, especially when it is as well done as this is. (And I fell out of my chair laughing on the last page!) <br />This book grabs you from the start and pulls you along, never stopping (except to let you savor the wonderful sensual scenes) until you get to the last page, so be warned: start it early in the day because you won't put it down. And be prepared to buy Dove bars your next trip to the grocery store.<br />I've never been the least bit disappointed in a Crusie book, and I hate to bring this up but it was a bothersome: the use of two people talking within the same paragraph. It was used all through this book (and according to my writing group, it's the Coming Thing in Writing) and it's confusing as all get-out. Whenever it's done, I have to go back to see that it indeed was two people talking and not one, and then figure out who the next paragraph of dialogue, which is never credited, comes from. It really stops the story. Please don't do it any more, Jennifer!<br />And I was also hoping that Chief Mazur would mention his Grandma Mazur, so this would tie into Evanovich's Stephanie Plum series! ;^)<br />But other than that the book is a terrific read and the potential reader is doing themself a real favor by picking it up. Go, Jennifer!	2001-05-01

Excellent world-building! I really liked how the superheroes fit (or rather, didn't fit) into society. I also enjoyed all the characters except for the villain, who wasn't given any redeeming characteristics. The heroine was someone I could root for, as well as her boyfriend and her two nutty friends and the talking ferret.<br />But... There was too much exposition in dialogue scenes, where someone would say something and then you'd get two paragraphs of the responder trying to figure out what had been said and what to say, and then they'd say something and you'd get two paragraphs... I'd rather read straight dialogue. Also, there were a lot of plot shortcuts taken during the last half of the book where people did things that weren't logical, just so the plot could proceed. The guy assigned to protect our heroine completely disappeared. Where was he? And the scene where our hero met the heroine's mother... what was that? Wrong scene, wrong PoV, went off on a strange tangent and left me scratching my head. Speaking of PoV, there were too many.<br />But the sparks between hero and heroine were quite tasty and the humor of the book was consistent and very good, sometimes laugh-out-loud, which is VERY hard to do! Again I have to issue commendations for world-building.<br />I'll be keeping an eye on Julie Kenner's future books.	2001-04-25

Not being one to read book jackets (they give too much away), I didn't know this was the second in a series, and the large cast of SEALs confused me until the book settled down to three sub-plots with only two characters in each.<br />The book gave me both wonderful romance in very different shading with the sub-plots and suspenseful adventure in the main plot. Truthfully, I didn't know how it was going to turn out since I didn't know if I'd categorize this as a suspense/adventure or a romance. I grew to love all the characters -- something I rarely do -- and was wholly caught up in their situations. Very glad to see that one of the sub-plots will be dealt with in the next book, because that was one of the few disappointments with this for me, that the one sub-plot, though given a reasonable ending, didn't follow through far enough. (I also was uncomfortable with the many permutations of John Nillson's name, which confused me while he was still just one of the crowd until I caught on later.)<br />And may I add that the love scenes are particularly sensuously written? It's always a pleasure when a writer knows how to write a love scene well instead of the way most are written: like 1-2-3 sex primers with no soul. Definite hot-lava mojo and deep emotions going on here!<br />Excellent choice for reading, but be warned that you won't be able to put it down. I will certainly go back and buy the first volume and keep a lookout for the third.	2001-04-16

These are a very good length for light reading, a good idea.<br />&quot;Undercover Elf&quot; is the better of the two stories, perhaps because it has a lot more humor (though some of it is rather slapstick). &quot;Unexpected Angel&quot; has a really cute little kid, though, so perhaps they even out. It was a nice touch (and easy to do when the same author does both stories) that the stories intersected for about a paragraph apiece and took place in the same town.<br />Two totally different storylines (both are Christmas-oriented) offer wonderful heroes and interesting heroines immersed in unusual situations. The sex scenes were written very smoothly (something you don't usually find) and didn't overpower the plot. The sexual tension had all the emphasis, as it should have. I enjoyed the entire book.<br />Just one question: who the heck ATE all that food Holly made during &quot;Unexpected Angel?&quot; She was a full-blown bakery running at top speed, but there were only four of them in the house...	2001-02-14

(Duets, 43)	Books	4	2	2	N	N	A wonderful length for light reading	&quot;Making Mr. Right&quot; was the lesser of these two stories in that it went all too easily, and clothes were all there was to making the man. I got the impression at times that surface was all that mattered, when I'm sure the author didn't mean that; she just didn't have enough room to deal with other matters. Also, the misogynist atmosphere of the office: I was rooting for someone, hopefully the heroine, to take those boys to court for sexual discrimination! No one should have to work in those kinds of conditions. So in all, though this book had a good situation and interesting characters and a lot of good chemistry (sometimes that chemistry was too drawn out), it was a little too fluffy and surface for my tastes. But I look forward to more by the author.<br />&quot;I Waxed My Legs for This?&quot; sounds too much like the country song, but it was the better story with a lot of humor. Nicely-turned characters, great magnetism, and keep your hanky at the ready. Just the right length for this format.	2001-02-14

Indeed, the cast does remind me of a Plum novel, filled with rich and varied characters with their own delicious foibles, most of whom operate in the comfortable family atmosphere.<br />Speaking of delicious, each chapter begins with a recipe. The ONLY problem I had with the book is that some of the recipes seemed to have skipped a step here and there. Guess I'll just have to experiment.<br />But back to the real meat: the book. Great chemistry between hero and heroine; nice, tight plot with lots of humor. The only beef I really had was that I expected the subplot with the brother to be resolved, and I wanted to learn more about the sister, whose marriage does not seem to be in the best of shape. When finished, I saw that the brother's story makes up the next book, and I'm presuming that Sis gets the third. I'll have my eye out for both, for this truly was just a fun, fun read and I expect to be hearing great things from Millie Criswell.	2001-02-07

Everyone in the range of the Star Lake Lodge is a person I'd love to know, even down to the guy who runs the hardware store who sneaks a smoke out in back even though he's on oxygen.<br />The love story has a good bit of chemistry, the family is charming, the threat is definitely scare material. For a while I was afraid that Best Friend's predicament was going to be the basis for another book but no, it's wonderfully resolved as well within this novel.<br />Lovely and nice and funny and goes quite well with a bubble bath.	2001-02-07

The intelligent heroine, so long ignored by society, finds her wishes coming true, her lifestyle abruptly changing to the point where she can finally dig in and do a lot of good in the world within her marriage of convenience (ha ha! Little does she realize...). Chemistry between hero and heroine was right up there, although I thought the &quot;crossed wires&quot; misunderstanding went on too long and came out of nowhere. A minor quibble that didn't detract too much from the rest of an excellent work. <br />Even the servants are richly-painted characters that you can chuckle with. Very nice characterizations all around. Wonderful situation. A lovely read.	2001-02-07

Yes, I guessed who the mother was about halfway through, but I had so much fun getting to the end of this book that I really didn't care. Intelligent heroines are always a delight to read about, and this one sparked fire against her hero. Interesting darker characters balanced the book very well without being the outrageous villains that I've run into so much lately. The plot kept me turning pages to see what was going to happen next, and the atmosphere was rich with history, silks and prim young women who dare to risk the unthinkable. And the dashing rogue of a hero wears spectacles when he writes! Wonderful dichotomies at work here.	2001-02-07

I wish covers would note -- honestly -- that a reader won't be able to set down a particular book. I'd have started this one earlier in the day and my eyes wouldn't have been so bleary the next. It's a short book that doesn't meander into subplot and keeps its focus directly on the lead characters, who have full lives and mesh well. In particular I was drawn to Annie, the abused wife who has with this volume undergone therapy. It was fascinating to watch her taking her lessons to heart and refashioning her life. The way her son adapts to their new life was also an emotional rollercoaster. There was the slightest of problems with head-hopping early in the book, but it didn't last long. Overall, this is a real page-turner with extremely likeable characters, a serious villain who is not hokey, and a wonderful attitude about changing your life for the better. Looking forward to Virginia's next book!	2000-12-26

The author should have stopped here and given us a strong character-driven story dealing with the Industrial Age as it impacted Old Blood and its stifling society mores. But she didn't.<br />Instead she contrives a military plot, leaving the interesting antagonists behind and forcing her hero to change his personality to fill in the gaps for needed conflict. Whenever inventions or the war are mentioned, a great fog of vagueness enters the text. We don't know what the hero invents; I doubt if the author knows either. But oh, it saves lives, so it must be good. His great war experiments involve lights to be viewed on the other side of the English Channel. The author invokes the term &quot;lenses,&quot; but that's all we know about it and it sounds highly unlikely. And the war? &quot;Wellington,&quot; one character says, which is supposed to explain all. And I was totally mystified by several passages in the final chapter -- passages that were a set-up for another book involving the youngest brother of the family, something that had nothing to do with this volume.<br />I didn't buy this to read a hard military adventure or sci fi novel, but there is a need for an author to research things and drop a learned line or two so that the readers' suspension of disbelief sticks around. Mine took off quite early, leaving me to read very shallow characterization about silly people who did even sillier things (thank goodness the villains were extremely stupid) as the plot moved them through its paces. The characters should have been leading this plot, not the other way around. The regency language is there, but nothing else of substance is. After two failed tries with April Kihlstrom, I think for regencyI'll stick with Sabrina Jeffries.	2000-11-29

I want to read books where the characters change from beginning to end. I like my mysteries to be mysteries and not obvious enough to be guessed in the first third of the book. Miss Tibbles doesn't even solve this mystery herself. Though it would appear that she might have, we never saw it, and thus this reader was left completely unsatisfied. One character in the book does solve the mystery... on an extremely flimsy remark. I certainly didn't believe it.<br />Oh, the prose of the book is nice enough, but nice doesn't stretch any boundaries. It doesn't make me think. If the author truly likes this character, I hope that her next book lets Marian (and please settle on how the reader is presented with her name!) flesh out a bit and entertain some bolder, perhaps even flamboyant characters whose lives, manners and viewpoints are changed by their circumstances. Just because the Regency era was so constrained doesn't mean that a 21st Century reader must be similarly constrained.	2000-11-26

This book is a page-turner, definitely deserving of my rare five stars. Don't do like I did and start reading it late at night! While this doesn't contain all the humor that her last book had, the reader truly gets tangled up in the characterization and plot twists (and twists, and twists) that abound. Our chubby (and quite opinionated) heroine was a lovely change from the supermodels one usually finds in romance. Wish someone had told the cover artist. (But I do want to mention that I'm a fan of the artist's style. Very nice work; wrong subject.) Add to all the excellence of the book the incredible writing of the sex scenes which flow like butter, not like the uncomfortable hedging or melodrama in many other romances. My only suggestion (a tiny one) is that the sex scenes wouldn't run quite so long in future books. They're exciting... but cut 'em back just a tad, Sabrina. Oh, now's the wait for the next Sabrina Jeffries book to come out!	2000-11-14
US	52999835	R1WVA9DSQTU1CE	0312975651	251671300	Our Husband	Books	3	23	37	N	N	Too fluffy for my tastes	There's a wonderfully lurid basic premise to this book: polygamy, with a murder mystery thrown in. In fact the book moves quickly to the point where the three wives and husband meet. Then it doesn't know what to do with itself and bogs itself down with stereotypes and ridiculous situations. <br />I'm not fond of books that switch viewpoints with each chapter like a relay race. But to have one (and for a large part of the book, two) characters being unbelievable AND trying to carry chapters on their own is too much to expect the reader to take. The youngest wife is not only a total surface stereotype, but an outdated one. The oldest does begin to gain some little depth by book's end, but not enough. The middle one is the one who should have carried the book completely, for she has the depth, believability and (a little of the) strength needed for a heroine. Unfortunately, she's the one who gets the very quick romance plotline -- something that made me lose all respect for her and her lover because of its timing. She turns out to be rather stupid in matters of life and hasn't really learned any lesson by book's end. Thank goodness she's lucky and finds herself in a good situation. (Btw, this character's brother, a fascinating study in himself, is practically forgotten in the latter part of the book.)<br />We have a book here that misses having sympathetic characters in it and mistakes gimmick for plot. In the end, this comes off as pure concocted fluff, a particular disappointment because of all the evidence that the author is capable of so much more. Better luck with your next book.	2000-10-12

They really catch my eye.<br />Yes, the characters in the book are familiar ones: the prudish heiress, the laid-back cop, but Andersen puts them through their paces very well, embroidering their backgrounds and adding engaging depth to their characters. I found I liked them both enormously. The secondary characters (other than the villains) were also wonderful to read about.<br />The bits of New Orleans that we did get to see (I really wanted to see more but this was a romance, not a travelogue) were not the standard material. The basic writing of the book was not standard, either. It got up and moved; it kept me turning pages. I've found that in romance much of the time, authors who write non-sex well have a hard time writing sex, or vice-versa. This wasn't the case here, and the sexual scenes oozed with real fire.<br />Very nicely done! I'd love to see what Andersen could do with a mainstream novel. Make it in New Orleans -- you've really piqued my interest in the city!	2000-10-04

A tightly-written novel that starts with a strange, naked man in the heroine's bed and proceeds at a fair pace. I liked the preceding novel in the trilogy well enough, but this is better. The characters are fleshed out quite well, and though I wanted to strangle the heroine at times, she had extremely good reasons for being such a wimp -- which made her seem so much more courageous when she decided finally to DO something about her situation.<br />That situation is a tense one, very well constructed and scary, and the addition of some realistic-sounding kids complicates matters even further. Hero and heroine showed a very warm chemistry. Sean is definitely someone I wouldn't mind having live in my garage... or finding naked in my bed. The sex scenes arose organically from the plot, unlike the slightly uncomfortable ones in the previous novel. Well done and enjoyed!<br />Cover: quite eyecatching!	2000-10-04

An interesting premise, good beginning, fairly good if standard main characters (the hero is quite bland for a historical), but still fairly fluffy. The scenes that really grabbed my attention were the insane asylum ones. I was also amazed that a book of this type would have the heroine as an opium user. More of these elements (and at a deeper level) would have added needed meat to the book. SPOILER: As it was, one of the characters does a one-eighty three-quarters of the way through that is completely unbelievable. From uneducated, unsophisticated waif to commanding bosslady in sixty seconds. Nope, that totally lost me.

No, we don't know why the time travel works, but then it's rarely explained, is it? (That's the reason I'm not fond of the genre.) As a book, this is solidly written, nicely paced, and the heroine is as interesting a heroine as you'll probably find except that we really have little idea of her background. But the hero--! I still haven't figured out WHY the heroine was attracted to him other than by his manly good looks. We never learned enough about him to assign him a personality. He's handsome. He's rich. He's a lord. He also drinks too much and is unkind to women he's not attracted to. Sorry, I want more in a hero. <br />I also want to know why the heroine's such a Luddite. Apparently life with technology was fun and roses (and of course it's always handy to have had a certain history course in college that one remembers dates from: too much coincidence!). I enjoyed the parts about exercising and fat-free foods. The humor of the book was appreciated. A little more of the hardships of primitive life, a little more fleshing out of the hero (and heroine's background) and this would be a fine book.	2000-09-28
US	52999835	R2BOW8QQNZTK17	0380813955	217050035	Wishin' on a Star	Books	3	1	1	N	N	Interesting but uneven	The plot of &quot;Wishin'&quot; is a solid one, a basis for what could be  a very compelling book. Unfortunately, it stays on the surface and never  delves deep. The relationship is handled too deeply too suddenly, the sex  is rushed, the characters (primary and secondary) too cliched to really  ring true. Also, dialogue runs from quite stilted in some chapters to  relaxed in others, to all exotic phrases in others -- very  uneven.<br />There's nothing here that some editing couldn't have helped. The  writer shows true promise and just needs to be guided to make her books  deeper, more emotional, more real. She has a theme of universal love as  well as the reality of paranormal events in this modern world that needs to  be read by a lot of people. I think in the future she'll really start to  shine (let's just hope she changes her nom de plume to a more serious  one).<br />Two more comments: why bring up the dog fighting? Talk about a  loose thread. I was disappointed that the lead character didn't object even  a little to it.<br />And I love the style of this cover! I've seen a few books  like this and find the style very refreshing!	2000-09-12

Have to agree  about the level of the banter. It was truly unnatural-sounding and didn't  digest well at all. The characters seem as if they should make a compelling  mix, but their dialogue was just so desperately trying to be clever and  failing that I don't really want to meet them. Perhaps the writing improves  later on, but I've got too many unread books on my shelf to take the effort  to wade through this to find out.<br />I'm told that Joy's other books are  very good, so I may try her again sometime. This book doesn't fire me up to  doing so soon.<br />Nice guy on the cover.	2000-09-12
US	52999835	R2ZHSQ1NQZ01R1	0380400634	645616910	The Enchanted Land (Avon Historical Romance)	Books	1	6	7	N	N	What book did these other reviewers read?	I found this one pretty darned awful. The heroine is one of those dishrag types who are always acted upon and don't act themselves until life has so beaten them up (hundreds of pages into the book) that they have to do  SOMETHING or just wither away from self-disgust. The plot is one of these  Perils of Pauline deals, where the heroine is fished out of one peril just  to fall into another, ad nauseum. Villains are cartoonishly so (and even  though the heroine knows better, she trusts them long enough to fall into  another trap). And the characterizations are such that people change from  paragraph to paragraph, depending on whether the scene's going where it  should or not. These aren't real people; these aren't real adventures. This  is the kind of book that gives romance its bad reputation.<br />The biggest  problem is, I read this book because an acquaintance told me how much she  LOVES Deveraux! I guess either Deveraux had a temporary low spot in her  career, or that I need to have my acquaintance read, say, Smith's A Place  to Call Home or Jeffries' The Dangerous Lord to find out what good romance  writing is.	2000-04-26

I'd heard that this book or its sequel had won some awards, so I tried it out with high hopes. Unfortunately, I had to force myself to finish a book overburdened with purple prose, a predictable plot, sudden and often  inexplicably-timed explicit sex, and one-dimensional characters who live  only for their Eternal Love (or in the case of the villain, for his Eternal  Hatred). I wanted to scream at all of them to get a life! To make matters  worse, the blurb on the back cover gives away 2/3 of the book's plot. I can  say as a positive point that the book did have a solid starting point for  its plot with the concept of the immortal witches and how they get to be  so. <br />I hope that the author's other books feature well-rounded characters  and plot twists, because this book certainly didn't. It will be quite some  time before I try another Maggie Shayne book; there are too many other  interesting-sounding ones to browse through here on Amazon!	2000-04-12

Her characters are fairly interesting, the character conflict certainly intriguing. But I never thought that the heroine was  really in the story; she was unchanged (except by shock) by her  circumstances. The small-town girl makes an exciting journey before the  book begins... what did she think of that? She has to walk three months  through wilderness, a potentially fascinating narrative (I certainly  couldn't do that and survive!) that is glossed over in one sentence. The  hero faces charges that I thought would be the big plot climax (as opposed  to the relationship climax) to the book... and it turns out to be skipped  over, practically forgotten. (Also, we never saw the hero fight pirates,  which would be his reason for being a noble person. He had a chance to  prove himself to the reader and the authorities, and never did!)<br />With her  next book I hope the author remembers that although she can have  interesting characters, they need to be firmly enmeshed in their plot and  affected by it. In a historical, we also need to feel that these are not  21st Century people pretending to be in earlier centuries. Again, the  author does show a terrific use of language in parts, and handles the  sexual tension well (if it's quite drawn-out in the first chapter). I hope  that her next book will come out soon so we can see how much she's  improved! She shows real promise.<br />And ps: the cover really was  unfortunate. The guy's staring at the girl's breasts, and both look like  they just stepped out of a small music club just down the street.	2000-04-10

I'm going to have to start downgrading my other ratings if people are putting out books like this! Definitely five stars across the board. If anyone ever sneers that some people read -- sniff --  _romances! _ hand them this book. It's so well-crafted, so intricately  plotted and actually contains real humor! Yes, I said humor!  The  characters are delightful and people I want to meet, with incredible  chemistry between them. The setting is very much a part of the plot and the  situation; the dialogue is sparkling. I so admire how there seems not to be  a wasted word in the entire book as the plot keeps lunging forward, pulling  me with it. Honestly, I could not put this book down. <br />Do I have anything  at all to nitpick? Perhaps the final chapter wasn't needed, but for those  who require a celebration to top off the happy ending (I'm not giving  anything away; this is romance after all), you have that as well. If only  they'd have put a cover with a little more pizzazz on the book (the clench  back cover is really quite pedestrian, as opposed to the incredible romance  within). To sum up: BUY THIS BOOK! And congratulations, Sabrina Jeffries on  a job well-done. (I just did a search on Amazon.com and found that there  are two more books in this series... and one of them, The Pirate Lord, is  out of print! How could you have your publishers do this to us? Argh. I'll  find it somewhere...)	2000-03-19

He uses tight plots, interesting characters, balanced couples, and the atmosphere of the West  seems to spark every scene. They are a delight to read -- with one caveat.  Space out your reading, for apparently they all have the same general plot,  even the same sex scene. After reading three at once, I was able to point  to sections in the fourth book and say, &quot;covetous neighbor introduced  here,&quot; &quot;first sex scene here,&quot; &quot;kidnapping here,&quot;  and know that the woman would say &quot;please&quot; during the sex, which  seems to consist of the same foreplay each time. It's fine to have a  formula if it works well, and Mr. Greenwood's formula certainly does!  Again, I emphasize how exciting and well-written (and crafted) his books  are. But just don't read them all together or you'll get a serious case of  deja vu.	2000-03-15

I kept turning the pages. But the problems arising in the bedroom are something  I've seen in too many romance novels (WHY don't these people talk about  their problems? WHY is it that the bride never knows what to do?). It's  done well, but it's becoming a cliche -- although it doesn't bother the  readability of the book. I thought the heroine should have been more  concerned/traumatized by what happened to her adoptive Indian family,  something that occurred at a later age, than with her first family, the one  she couldn't remember. The Indians were glossed over, practically  forgotten. What bothered me in particular was the very end, the sudden  comic-book devolution of the villain, just how much of a dastard he is  (what's wrong with letting him hold on to a touch of humanity for realism?)  (I expected him to be twirling his moustache by the end) and how he's dealt  with. It was totally beyond the level of what was needed and spoiled the  book, which is otherwise quite a good one for the genre. &quot;His Stolen  Bride&quot; is the better book, a sequel to this one dealing with one of  the sons.	2000-03-14

What a relief to finally find someone who can not only plot well, but has a fine hand for writing and characterization as well -- in the romance genre, no less! I'd been through ten romance books in the past few months and was astonished at the mere fact that such garbage had gotten printed,  but here comes this book to reaffirm my faith in the genre. Sure, there are  a few cliches, but even those are well-written. I would have appreciated a  toning down of the hero (who fits the typical romance mold), but the  heroine was refreshing and not the totally-liberated woman that you so  often find in historicals. The author even handled the sex scenes with  penache, a rarity. I will certainly be keeping an eye out for more of Ms.  Carroll's work!	2000-01-11

Worse than that, though, were the characters. They would progress to a certain point  and then turn around, take a couple of skips, and reemerge totally  unrecognizable and unrealistic. The most blatant of these was a character  (I don't want to spoil it, but watch out here) who is a very good guy, then  becomes a spouse beater/rapist, and then suddenly a good guy again. Excuse  me? And what's this with golden retrievers living to be twenty? Why doesn't  this lead character demonstrate any responsibility for contraception? And a  woman who has held no jobs before suddenly becomes the best secretary in  the Senate? There is a leap of faith in all good fiction, but here my faith  stumbled, fell, and finally gave up before I was even halfway through.  Imho: very bad soap opera. I hope the next book pays more attention to  these most crucial of writing points: plot and character.	1999-10-18

This isn't the best in the series, but even a moderate Stephanie Plum book is better than 95% of the books out there! Grandma Morelli and her evil eye are something I definitely want more of in the future, but I hope we've  seen the last of Sally, and that Joyce will be in jail -- or an FTA -- in  future episodes. The sheer evil of (hiss!) Joyce should not be diluted by  extended appearances! The thing that made this book sing to me was the  romance -- finally, finally! But the mystery plot was weak in comparison.  Is there some way to give us plot and romance in equal parts in the future?  (And is there any way to have Stephanie and Ranger get together without  losing the mystery of the Batman? He's promised her one night, and he  doesn't seem the kind of man to go back on his word.) After a year in the  biz I would hope Stephanie's self-defense training would be a little better  than shown, and that she wouldn't drag incompetents (but funny guys all)  around with her during the more dangerous parts of her work. And I really  hope that Grandma Morelli's baby prediction won't come true! (Glad to see  attention given to safe sex practice, Janet.) As usual, I laughed and  laughed -- nothing gives such pleasure as a Plum story!	1998-12-15

Then I have to agree with the customer who recommended Janet Evanovich's Stephanie Plum series (also available from amazon.com, of course). While I'm waiting for the next Anita installment, I decided to try out &quot;One  for the Money&quot; and was totally hooked. Squeaky-tight plotting, scarey  scenes and sexual tension with gut-busting humor. I laughed all weekend as  I went through 3 of the books. Stephanie vs Anita? Anita would probably get  mad at her and blow her away. (And then Stephanie's Ranger would blow Anita  away.) But I'd prefer to spend time with Stephanie. She doesn't have any  vamps or such in her world, but her attitude runs along the same lines as  Anita, only with a lot more humanity involved. Now the real question:  Anita's Richard vs Stephanie's Morelli? Both hunks, both sweetie-pies...  I'll have to buy another installment of both series and think about it some  more.  Life is good.	1998-12-14

After reading One for the Money, I FLEW out to the nearest bookstore and snarfed up the next two volumes! Laughed until I hurt, read until my eyes refused to read any more, and got up early the next morning (4 am) and  finished. I adore this series. I wouldn't mind a good, long sex scene --  we've been waiting for so long for it! -- but otherwise I can't remember  when I've had such a good time reading a series. Darkover's gone bust, and  Anita Blake, vampire executioner, has been suffering from lack of plotting  recently. But Evanovich gives us super tight plots, crazy and delightful  (and scarey) characters, Rex the Wonder Hampster and... Batman?? Anita  Blake has her Richard and Jean-Claude, but Stephanie has the much more sexy  Morelli and Ranger.  More, please, Janet!!!	1998-12-14

In addition, the clothing and the sex were taking predominance over the plot. With Blue Moon  I'm happy to say that the real, human Anita is back, hooray! But yes, the  sex does dominate the plot, but it's better-written sex than before,  fitting in with the flow of the writing and the plot. Unfortunately, we are  still regaled with each and every piece of clothing that all the characters  (of which there are too many, in my opinion, and all of them lust over Ms.  Blake) wear -- and they change clothes often. A plot? Forget the plot in  this book. Anita made a big relationship mistake two books ago, and now  she's started to straighten things out, which is a giant step in the right  direction for the series. Next book, I hope we'll get back to a real  mystery/thriller, plus I hope to see in more detail some of the many  fascinating creatures that inhabit Anita's world, such as the trolls in  this volume. And I still want to meet Anita's family!	1998-12-11

City of  Sorcery finishes off the Free Amazon trilogy, which is my favorite of the  Darkover books. The first reading, however, left me flat. I mean, I either  love or am incredibly disappointed by an MZB book; this was the first that  I would classify being in middle ground. But a year or two later I reread  the trilogy and the book had improved greatly. A few years later, a  rereading, and I found myself enjoying this tremendously. Characters meet  their destinies in a very satisfying way. Jaelle's life story comes full  circle to fit snugly into Darkover continuity. The whole is accomplished by  remarkable mountain-climbing narrative (don't read this on a chilly day!)  with a slew of familiar and new characters rounding out the almost  completely-female cast. Although melodramatic, hinting of the worse MZB  books, the style manages to remain clear and easy-reading, not too syrupy,  and not nearly as all-out explanatory as MZB's latest Darkover books are.  If you like Darkover, Free Amazons, Jaelle, Camilla and Magda... you'll  warm up to this one.	1998-09-16

Other than that I found it over-long -- ponderous, in fact -- overloaded  with explanation upon explanation about Darkover society that should be  telegraphed by now as it is in the other Darkover books. Obvious in plot,  syrupy, peopled with characters that take sudden questionable leaps of  logic and emotion... It comes out as a bad romance novel that quits in  mid-plot. Perhaps MZB is just so famous that her editors don't dare make  suggestions any more? She can do much, much better than this. Go get The  Shattered Chain  or The Bloody Sun instead.	1998-09-16

Although the beginning of the book (like most of the preceding novel)jumps around like a Dungeons and Dragons adventure -- something worse awaits beyond every corner -- by the time Anita finally gets rid of that split-side dress things get back to normal for an action-packed Anita Blake novel. From the relationship point of view there's still hope for Richard, although it seems like the final settlement will be a menage a trois. But the most important point is that the real Anita returns with this book in temperament. Whereas before she was building to shooting anyone for the most minor of reasons, now she's controlling herself better; her trigger finger isn't nearly so itchy. The bad news is that her powers are too strong and need to be tempered by her triumvirate in future stories. But the fun, the gore, the titillation -- and Larry, the Executioner-in-training -- are all back. Hopefully future books will concentrate on the world of Anita and inhuman rights as well as the Blake family. With this book, I'm determined to keep on reading future installments of the series.	1998-06-17
