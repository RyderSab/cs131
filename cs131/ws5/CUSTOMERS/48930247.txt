Also, I got the paperback of this book now.  It has a reader guide to the book, interview with her, discussion guide for book group/club, what books shes recommds as well.<br /><br />I wonder if Dr. De Marneffe read Naomi Wolf's recent work, which I also suggested as well in that review, Misconceptions:  Truth, Lies, and the Unexpected on to the Journey of Motherhood, published by Doubleday (hardcover), then Anchor Books (paperback), 2001 and 2003.<br /><br />I feel that women from mid to late teens to old age (depends on the old age part it of course).<br /><br />Thank you.	2004-06-04

The book embody a 1999 family, time traveling to the spring of 1900 to live three months as victorians.  It's takes place in the south-east part of London, near the millenium dome.  The book starts out with the history of late victorian britain and a timeline of 1900 in England.  Then, you will read about how they started this project and etc.  This book was a great read for me because I learned more than I learned watching this series or in history.  This is a great read for anyone, I mean anyone.	2000-10-01
