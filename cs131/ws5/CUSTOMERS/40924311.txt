Mama, dressed in bright red, leaves her five little mischief-makers with a blue-eye-shadowed, bubble-gum blowing teen named Lulu.  They'll try anything to keep from going to bed at eight, including an ongoing game of hide-and-seek and a frantic quest for the ultimate hiding spot.  My girls, ages 5 and 3, love all the books in the Five Little Monkey series because they're so silly.  The rhyming text and repetitive phrases make it easy for them to read along with me...over and over again, of course (they're not the only monkeys who hate to go to bed on time!).	2005-04-18

As a mother of three girls, I figured I'd try to squeeze in a few pages at a time - but I couldn't put it down!  If you want to say \\"Thanks! I love you!\\" to your mom, grandmother, or woman who has influenced your own life, give them this devotional book.  The format is simple: a quote and Bible verse on the left page, a short anecdote on the right.  Some pages made me laugh out loud.  Others (as my pastor likes to say) made me say \\"ouch!\\"  The Acknowledgements section in the front of the book credits people for the quotes.  I found myself flipping back and forth to find out who offered such words of wisdom on motherhood.  Two of my favorite quotes are \\"The best time to give children your advice is when they are young enough to believe you know what you are talking about.\\"  And \\"Give your troubles to God; He will be up all night anyway.\\"  A great mother's day gift!	2005-04-18

Comprehensive.  Creative.  An excellent resource for teachers, parents, and caregivers.  As a mother of  girls aged 4 years 9 months and 3 years, I was searching for  activities that they both would enjoy and that I could adapt to their different levels of development.  This book is a lifesaver!  For each theme, the author, Pamela Waterman, provides several Art projects with simple instructions, a few Indoor activities, suggested Musical activities or songs to sing, activities to do Outdoors, Books to check out from the library or buy, Videos to rent or buy, and special snacks to make.  All theme related.  Most using supplies that are easily found around the home or inexpensive to purchase.  There is even a section called Hints for Your Own Situation that includes tips for older children.  You can follow the themes from A to Z, or skip around to various favorites as I do.  With 52 Weeks of Themes, here are a few:<br /><br />Astronomy<br /><br />Bugs<br /><br />Circus<br /><br />Detectives<br /><br />Firefighting<br /><br />Hair<br /><br />Musical Instruments<br /><br />Pirates<br /><br />Restaurant<br /><br />Surprises!<br /><br />Theater<br /><br />Wheels<br /><br />Zoo	2004-10-17

And one dare - a dangerous dare, as a young Tiki Barber finds out.<br /><br />\\"It's a serious injury.  I'm not sure he will ever play again,\\" claims the doctor. Tiki is determined to prove him wrong.<br /><br />I liked this book because it illustrates several virtues, like PATIENCE. During one looooooong hot summer, Tiki must watch his twin brother Ronde play ball while he waits for his leg to heal.  And PERSEVERANCE.  The twins, born premature, overcome their smaller stature to make the basketball team.<br /><br />This book is filled with motivational sayings, like \\"Believe in yourself and others will, too.\\" And \\"We have to keep working at it.\\" Now Ronde plays for Tampa Bay and Tiki for the NY Giants, so they no longer play \\"side by side.\\"  But they still \\"Play Proud!\\" as their mama told them to do.<br /><br />Similar to the Michael Jordan book Salt in His Shoes, this book will be inspiring to parents or children, boys or girls, athletes or spectators alike.	2004-09-15

When the station roof is damaged during a storm, everyone pitches in to repair it.  Everyone is useful! As a parent, I thought this book was ?useful? because: (1) it is a good introduction to readers who are not as familiar with Thomas and his friends, (2) children like my 2.5-year-old can identify with Henry the Green Engine?s fear of thunderstorms, (3) readers can cheer Thomas on as he searches for his missing friends Henry, Percy, and James, (4) parents can engage their children by asking questions, such as ?What was James supposed to fetch again?? The answer is lumber, bricks, and slate, (5) parents can also point out the bad behavior of the freight cars and stress the consequences of not doing what you are told.	2004-07-20

When we first got this book, my daughters wanted me to read it to them all the way through.  Now they select their favorites, like ?Meet Diego? and ?Dora?s Treasure Hunt.?  The seven stories are abridged versions of the immensely popular Nickelodeon TV series.  Note that if you compare a story in the book to the actual TV show, some details have been omitted.  For example, Pirate Parrot and Swiper do not hunt treasure in the book.  BUT ? my girls could care less.  I recommend this book for any family that loves to explore with Dora.	2004-07-20

Featuring the usual cast of P.J., little sister Honey Bunny, best friend Potts Pig, and the large Funny Bunny family, it offers simple vocabulary and large font.  In this Step 2 reader designed for preschoolers thru Grade 1, P.J.'s dad brings home a magic kit full of amazing tricks and a whole lot of trouble.  The book teaches children the importance of practicing.  One day after reading the book overheard my 4.5 year old daughter chanting, \\"Practice! Practice! Practice!\\" as she was playing.  If you hear P. J. say, \\"Ta-da!\\" then watch out!  Your candy bar may - \\"POOF\\" - disappear like Potts Pig's did.  Or your doll may just float in thin air.  As an added bonus, the last page has a disappearing coin trick.  Readers - definitely try this at home!	2004-06-22

We first picked up this book last summer.  It regained popularity when the animated features on Playhouse Disney began rolling this June.  Both the book and TV versions show Shanna, with large, expressive eyes and plenty of sass.  Little brother Shane (same name as the illustrator, by the way) and stuffed critters Dinah-saurus, Ducky, and Tiger complete the quirky ensemble cast. Each story is told in catchy rhyming verse printed both in bold, easy-to-read font and speech balloons (like in comic strips).  The book gives 5 clues, the TV show only 3.  I like the problem solving skills it develops as it challenges readers to figure out what Shanna's occupation could be - a princess, ballerina, teacher, or doctor.  The story also encourages creativity.  My girls, ages 4.5 and 2.5, are often inspired to put on their own shows.	2004-06-22

My 4-year-old daughter, who is fascinated with ballerinas, has enjoyed every Angelina book I have read to her.  We were excited to find this latest story about her favorite dancing mouse.  In the story, Angelina finds a large envelope containing two tickets to see Serena Silvertail perform with the Royal Ballet.  But each time she asks a friend to attend with her, they have other plans!  This cleverly designed book features page-sized envelopes containing actual tickets, letters, and postcards that children can pull out and read.  My daughter's favorite is the large pull-out poster of the Cindermouse ballet.  The only problem we have had is that my less-than-gentle 2.5-year-old daughter was also eager to enjoy this book.  I've repaired a few envelopes with tape and I have to verify the pull-outs are still inside the flaps before reading the story again.  Definitely recommended reading!	2004-05-25

The most helpful tip for me is a list of \\"Nutrient-Rich Foods\\" (Chap 22) designed to help you lose weight postpartum.  I made a copy of it and posted it on my fridge.

There are numerous counting books on the market, but the comical illustrations rendered by Carey Armstrong-Ellis elevate this to a class by itself.  My daughters (ages 3 years 9 months and 2 years) enjoy a picture book all the more when the pictures provide plenty to look at while Mama reads.

When the door opens and a voice calls out, \\"Step on up, young lady,\\" Marcie does just that.  It will be the ride of her life, for she hears the courageous story of Rosa Parks straight from Rosa's bus itself. This story spans a spectrum of detail in 32 pages: from Rosa McCauley's childhood in Pine Level, Alabama, to her marriage to Raymond Parks, to that fateful bus ride on December 1, 1955, to her continued struggle for equality after the boycott.  The artistic style of Faith Ringgold leaps from the page in dramatic acrylic color on canvas.  The suggested reading age for this book is 5 - 9.  Yet it is not a quick read.  Text is detailed enough to make some younger listeners restless. Vocabulary is challenging enough to daunt some older beginner readers.  But don't let that deter you from sharing If a Bus Could Talk with your children. No doubt they take their integrated schools, pools, movies, and restaurants for granted.

In simple patterned text and peekaboo windows, children will discover what different living things grow up to be.  A playful kitten watches two orange and black fish swimming in a tank.  The fish are drawn inside a window.  Turn the page and the fish become eyes of a grown cat.  Some of the figures may be familiar to your child, like the kitten or a puppy.  Others may be delightfully fresh, such as a tadpole or a seedling.  Square in shape, this board book is perfectly sized for eager little hands.  The mirror on the last page reflects your little one's face that is sure to be smiling!  When we discovered this book, my girls (aged 3 yrs 9 mos and 2) asked me to read it again and again.  I knew I had a hit!  We plan to search for Laden's previous books as well.	2003-10-22

Hoptoad and his traveling buddies, a skinny lizard and a deceptively speedy tortoise, must scamper across a wide highway to avoid a mammoth red pickup.  (\\"Truck coming.  Heavy load.  Toad hop.

Ever wonder what the world looks like from a toad's bulging eyes?  In a two-page spread you can almost feel Hoptoad's fear as humongous headlights bear down on his quivering body frozen mid-road.  Will he make it across?  Or will he be flattened into a toad tortilla?  Get the book to find out!	2003-10-22

This particular tale stresses sentiments fitting for this holiday: manners (Spot helps his mom in the kitchen with the pumpkin pie), quality time with family (Grandpa and Grandma come for dinner) and patriotism (an American flag waves from the center of the pie).  While this book did not have the popular lift-the-flaps found in other Eric Hill books, such as the newly released Spot's Treasure Hunt or in Spot Can Count, my daughters (ages 3.75 and 2 years) still requested it again and again.	2003-10-15

Each letter introduces a ballet term.  Each drawing illuminates the term in graceful pastels.  Isadora once studied at the School of Ballet and danced with the Boston Ballet.  Her passion for the dance lives on in her books.  Don't miss the glossary after letter Z for Zipper: it helps the reader pronounce unfamiliar phrases and elaborates on word origins.  For example, P for Pas de chat (pah duh SHAH) is a French phrase meaning \\"step of the cat.\\"  T for Tutu, a costume made of several layers of tulle, was originally an underskirt worn under heavier fabric.

Then s/he slides out a sturdy cardboard insert to reveal the answer behind it.  My preschooler even learned the \\"crescent\\" shape, which forms the bridge across the Icky-Sticky Sand.  My 2-year-old had some trouble sliding the tabs with her smaller fingers.  Yet she insisted on exploring with her older sister.

The wide, square flaps are more durable than the smaller slide-the-arrow variety featured in other similar activity books such as What Do You Do With A Potty?  by Marianne Borgardt and Let's Go Potty by Moira Butterfield (but these books are also worth a look).

Out of three activity potty books we have found (see also Saras Potty by Harriet Ziefert and What Do You Do With A Potty?  by Marianne Borgardt) I thought this one a winner.  The text combines common elements found in other books, such as using the potty as a toy.  But it also includes some funny moments (watch out for Charlie the dog!).  Engaging ink-and-watercolor illustrations by Peter Utton are as lively as the text.  One word of caution: two of the flaps lift to reveal a puddle of pee on the floor.  One shows actual poop in Sams potty.  Didnt bother us, but may be more graphic for other readers taste.  The conclusion features a diverse group of children cheering from their potties (a first).  This book is more entertaining than educational, however (see The Potty Book for Girls by Alyssa Satin Capucilli, You Can Go to the Potty by Dr. Sears or What To Expect When You Use the Potty by Heidi Murkoff for more instructional picture books).	2003-10-13

Rather than read it to your toddler from cover to cover as you would a typical story book, keep it on hand as a quick reference guide.  When your son asks \\"Where does poop go when you flush?\\" you can point to Laura Rader's colorful illustration of four flushing toilets leading to a big underground tank.

I couldn't tell if the child is male or female, which makes it appealing to everyone.<br />\\"Peekaboo!  I see...\\" eager little readers searching soft pastel drawings for clues.  What DOES the child see?  The tip of a tail.  The top of a hat.  Turn the page to discover a playful puppy or laughing grandma.  Award-winner Rachel Isadora uses only 53 words, printed in large, easy-to-read type, to keep you guessing.<br />\\"Peekaboo!  I see...\\" pleased young readers requesting this book again and again.  The first evening my youngest daughter spent with a baby sitter, she cried when she realized Mama and Daddy were gone.  Thankfully a warm lap, soothing voice, and repeats of Peekaboo Morning comforted her until we returned.<br />For another heartwarming book by Isadora featuring simple text with large, easy-to-read print, and captivating illustrations, read In the Beginning.	2003-09-24

This was our first potty book - a gift from Grandma.  If you've spent any potty training time you know you've got to have patience while you wait...and wait...and wait.  This book helped to pass the time.  My daughter loved to lift the flaps and pull the tabs.  Eventually she began to \\"read\\" it for herself.  After two kids this book has seen better days (and lots of scotch tape).  But hopefully it will make it through our third child!<br />We have read almost every potty book available on the market as of 9/2003 (over two dozen!).  Most fit into two categories: INSTRUCTIONAL books that introduce the skills needed to master the potty; and those that are primarily ENTERTAINING, for children who understand what is supposed to happen on the potty, but need extra time to make it happen.<br />I think What Do You Do With A Potty fits more in the INSTRUCTIONAL category for the following reasons:<br />1) It identifies the purpose of the potty.<br />2) It specifies bodily functions (\\"poopy\\" and \\"tinkle\\" in this case)<br />3) Shows the transition from diapers to big kid underwear.<br />4) Includes the important steps such wiping, flushing, and hand washing.<br />For other activity books on this same subject, try Let's Go Potty by Moira Butterfield or Sara's Potty by Harriet Ziefert.<br />So what can you do with this book?  Enjoy it again and again!	2003-09-19

The book is hilarious throughout!  Shaggy's got flea problems and can't seem to shake them no matter what he does.  He gets by with a little help from his friends who agree to scratch his back - as long as Shaggy \\"pays\\" for the favor up front (like finding lost sheep who snicker and hide, or busting tons of suds in a diner).  I made sure to point out that sneaky flea in the illustrations to my girls (ages 3.5 and 2).  You may not need to do so with older readers.  Readers of all ages will love the ending!	2003-09-19

My daughters and I love to \\"leap\\" and \\"twirl\\" and \\"dip\\" and \\"flutter\\" along with the main character, Terry.  This is the perfect book for aspiring ballerinas.  In fact, any child who loves music, loves to dance will love Ballerina!  Peter Sis, illustrator of many children's books, has portrayed Terry in bold black and white strokes to complement his simple patterned text.  Terry's imaginary prima ballerinas that appear in her bedroom mirror soar in contrasting color.  He references several well-known ballets, such as The Nutcracker, Swan Lake, and Cinderella.  Each graceful movement is accompanied by a different color of the rainbow.  Applause!  Applause!	2003-09-19

I frequently choose Early Readers such as What A Mess! (a STEP Into Reading book intended for Preschool to Grade 1) even though my girls (ages 3 ½ and 2) are not yet learning to read.  The patterned text + playful kids + pets seemed ideal for my own little mess makers.<br />BUT...I thought two of the illustrations were irresponsible.  \\"Dennis\\" is drawing pictures on the wall with his crayons.  \\"Lee\\" is using Mama's lipstick to paint a clown face.  I've got enough problems without giving my girls the impression that such behavior is acceptable.<br />That said, I am sure your emergent reader is old enough to know better and will enjoy solving the mystery of the muddy footprints - right down to the surprise ending!	2003-09-19

The illustrations don't look much like the animation on PBS (the book must be the original - before Caillou was \\"discovered\\").  The book is colorful, but longwinded and somewhat repetitious.  My biggest beef with the story: Caillou ditches his diapers for underwear BEFORE he is potty trained.  That's insane!  As a result, Mommy ends up changing her son's wet pants often.<br />We have read almost every potty book available on the market as of 9/2003 (over two dozen!).  Most fit into two categories: INSTRUCTIONAL books that introduce the skills needed to master the potty; and those that are primarily ENTERTAINING, for children who understand what is supposed to happen on the potty, but need extra time to make it happen.<br />I think Caillou - Potty Time fits more in the INSTRUCTIONAL category for the following reasons:<br />1) It identifies the purpose of the potty.<br />2) It specifies bodily functions such as \\"poop\\" and \\"pee.\\"<br />3) Includes the important steps such flushing.<br />My advice - there are other instructional potty books on the market that are much better.  Try What to Expect When You Use the Potty by Heidi Murkoff, You Can Go to the Potty by Martha Sears, or My Big Girl Potty by Joanna Cole.	2003-09-19

Guido Van Genechten's illustrations, painted on old Belgian (?) newspaper, are bold, eye-catching...and silly!  How can you not laugh at Nellie Elephant's \\"great big bottom\\" squatting on Joe's little pot?  Or Missy Mouse's \\"teeny weeny bottom\\" perilously perched on the edge?  With this book you can introduce the potty concept while sliding in a lesson on contrasting shapes and sizes for good measure.  Throw in some extra \\"oinks\\", \\"woofs\\", \\"clucks\\", and \\"ribbits\\" and your child will love it even more.<br />We have read almost every potty book available on the market as of 9/2003 (over two dozen!).  Most fit into two categories: INSTRUCTIONAL books that introduce the skills needed to master the potty; and those that are primarily ENTERTAINING, for children who understand what is supposed to happen on the potty, but need extra time to make it happen.<br />I think Potty Time! fits more in the ENTERTAINING category. Two other delightful potty books featuring animals include Potty! by Mylo Freeman and Sara's (or Max's) Potty by Harriet Ziefert.	2003-09-19

Start counting from one end reading catchy rhyming text about ten pigs who bathe until they \\"aren't dirty anymore.\\"  Then FLIP THE BOOK OVER and watch those same pigs get dirty all over again!  My daughter was fascinating with the flip part.  I liked the illustrations.  Definitely worth a look.	2003-09-19

We loved the photos (instead of the usual drawings).  Baby Ernie had some of the same toys we have - my daughter loved that!  \\"Don't use too much, Ernie!\\" I often tell her when she rolls out too much toilet paper.<br />We have read almost every potty book available on the market as of 9/2003 (over two dozen!).

Three clever mice, illustrated by author Ellen Stoll Walsh in colorful cut-paper collage, discover three jars of \\"mouse paint.\\"  With childlike curiousity they dive right inside.  And like children who can't resist splashing in puddles (mine included), the mice \\"splash\\" and \\"mix\\" and \\"dance\\" until they make a colorful mess.  My daughters were already learning to identify colors.  With Mouse Paint I was able to introduce the mixing of colors RED, BLUE, and YELLOW to create GREEN, ORANGE, and PURPLE - a concept they would not have learned until later.	2003-09-19

Her biggest hurdle? The potty!  As with most potty training experiences (mine included), Hannah and her parents need plenty of patience...and paper towels!<br />Reality check.  I had two minor issues with the book: Hannah easily removes her diaper.  My girls struggled to get theirs off (at least at first).  And Hannah seems to graduate instantly from diapers to underwear after only one successful potty.  In my house that meant instant mess!<br />Otherwise, readers will chuckle over Alyssa Capucilli's delightful rhyme, rapped by Hannah herself, and Dorothy Stott's hilarious antics of Hannah's potty partner Teddy the bear.<br />We have read almost every potty book available on the market as of 9/2003 (over two dozen!).

Ashley realistic transitions from diapers to \\"special big-girl underpants\\" over time, not instantly.  Author Joanna Cole uses questions to draw the child into the story (\\"Do you wear diapers, too?\\") as an encouraging parent would.
