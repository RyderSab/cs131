A very intimate and enticing lure to the reader, Sandor Marai is a great story-teller and Carol Brown Janeway had done well in translating.<br />The star of the story, General Henrik, lights up many truths about life for us.  How does one cope with losing a loved one to another who is equally close to the heart?  What does waiting do to the soul?  What does friendship mean?<br />Albeit an intriguing tale, I was rather disappointed by the ending, which seemed to offer no closure.  Just why so?  Read on.	2003-03-23

Yes it is.  Yann Martel had created a simple story which made me beg for more.  It is one of the tales that kept you wanting to know what was going to happen next and made me feel sad when the story ended.<br />You will marvel at the adventures that Pi had at sea; how he trained the tiger, how he found food for both of them and a most interesting stopover at a little island with lots of algae.<br />Just where did Pi end up?

Infernal Affairs is one of them.<br />Jane Heller has written a very funny and captivating story about how Barbara's life was changed (for the better?) overnight when she accidentally made a pact with the devil.<br />I enjoyed the story every step of the way.  It kept me thinking and guessing who the characters in Barbara's life really were and I fell in love with the dog who appeared on her doorstep - Pete.  It made me wish I had a dog like him.<br />A lovely read that made me laugh out loud many times.  Very original, very addictive.  Go get it!	2003-03-23

We see the tragic tale of a loving family of seven from the viewpoint of Ellen, the third child and also the 'cement', of the family.<br />We are thrown back and forth in the story; we see bits and pieces of Ellen's life as we go along and very slowly, the puzzle starts to take form.<br />We realize that Ellen is not all laughter and joy as her story unfolds.  She has a morbid skeleton in the closet which she took more than 2 decades to find out, and she is here to share her discovery with us.<br />I couldn't help but stay up late to read this book.  The tale simply draws you in; the humour amidst the chaos keeps you wanting more.  The story brought a smile to my face, even though Ellen didn't deserve all that she went through.<br />Love it.  Read it.	2001-03-18

Not only does it warm your heart by the love of a woman and a man who are kindred spirits but got thrown apart by a mistake; the love a mother has for her child - a child whom no one wants to keep in their home, and the love of a child for her mother, a mother who is unable to love her the way she deserves.<br />Sappy, true, but how it grabs you with the beautiful dream that it holds.  How many of us seek for the love that knows no bounds, a small spark of love that that would lead to a changed world forever.<br />We see each character from their own eyes, we feel their emotions, feel their pain, cry their tears, wallow in their sorrows.  The simple prose leads us deep into the beings of each character of the story, a truly wonderful experience indeed.<br />Lovely story.  You'd identify with it if you have ever loved before.	2001-03-01

Bryce's backward looking technique in telling the story was well done, blending seamlessly into the tale that would grip you right from the start.<br />I loved how easily I was drawn into the life and sufferings of Jessica and I could almost feel for her; the loneliness arising from the cruelty of her mother's dominion over the family, her heartbreak when her true love goes to war, her joy and satisfaction of a friendship she found in an Aborigine lady.<br />I imagine that &quot;Jessica&quot; could become one of the tear-jerker movies that touches people and remind us all how cruel people can be, and to really appreciate and be thankful for all that we have.  &quot;Jessica&quot; will break your heart.<br />A great story told really well by Bryce.	2000-12-11

This is a tale of love and committment beyond the spectrum we know of.<br />I liked the way I'm teleported to another place where a normal life is changed by a single magical element - the spirit of Lauren Kline.<br />The language and prose of the story was soothing and easy to drink in albeit a lack of development links seemed to mark the story.  This caused &quot;little bumps&quot; in the tale which made me think &quot;sounds a bit strange there&quot; which prevented a smooth flow of events in the story.<br />Even though there was a predictable turn in Arthur's and Lauren's relationship, I was sucked into their whirlwind of great joy and couldn't suppress a smile.<br />A very enjoyable read that would keep you holding on to the end.	2000-12-05

WAITING tells of a story of love, and waiting, between two lovers caught in a restricted environment where the tiniest show of affection between them could cause them their future.<br />I had expected to be drawn into the story like it was when I read MEMOIRS OF A GEISHA. The settings of Waiting was unfamiliar to me and I couldn't connect with it as much as I wanted to.  The reader is not given an insight to the setting of the story nor the lives of the characters and that gave me a superficial feeling in regards to the story.<br />However, the characters are well developed; Lin, the male lead - a gentle loving man who is unable to get what he wants however he fights for it and Manna, the female lead, waiting, for the man she loves to finally be able to belong to her and during her wait, we see the events that cause her to lose her youth, her bright outlook to life and her vitality.<br />The prose is smooth and almost engaging.  But it doesn't make one feel for the characters; the pain of waiting, the shame of being intruded upon, the guilt for Lin's wife, Shuyu.<br />The plot is simple and unassuming.  At the end of the story, we all hold our breaths for a twist that seemed inevitable.  Does it come? ... ...<br />Waiting did not live up to my expectations, but it did entertain me.  It was a &quot;could be put down&quot; kind of book, but it wasn't difficult to bring it up again.	2000-11-03

Landon tells us his story from 40 years ago, a year of his life which changed him forever.<br />We are introduced to Jamie, a plain &quot;good&quot; girl whom everyone can identify with: conservative wear, no make-up, carries a Bible all the time.  Landon, then 17, young, brash, eager to blend into the crowd.<br />As &quot;the Lord's plan&quot; throws the two together, we smile and go &quot;awwww&quot; as we see them falling in sweet, innocent, wholesome love which we often wish for ourselves.  Sparks is able to wrench our hearts and at the same time, preparing us at the back of our minds, for something that would pop the bubble.<br />Along the lines of his other 2 novels, heartache was inevitable. Would you cry?  Would you scorn at the predictability of the story?  Do find out for yourself.	2000-11-03

I'd decided to give the movie a miss, thinking that it was &quot;one of those soppy AND predictable stuff&quot; and it never crossed my mind to  read the book until I read Nicholas Sparks' The Notebook.<br />I already had a  gist of what the story would turn out to be (thanks to a reviewer on  Amazon.com who gave the story away) but decided to sit through it  anyway.<br />Again, like The Notebook, I found it a captivating tale which  made me want to continue to read and read and read.  A lady giving herself  another chance at love, together with a man who lost his love of a  lifetime, is something that a lot of us can relate to.<br />Nicholas had  stirred our hearts and minds by putting together very touching prose which  speaks of a love so great and beautiful that it makes one wonder, just  where can we find a love like that?<br />The plot is nothing brand new but  still, the tale holds you and makes you ask for more.  Theresa and Garrett  are both very believable and realistic characters who are torn between very  human issues.  My heart went out to them, albeit I found it a little  strange that they would have such dilemmas at the crossroad of their  union.<br />A very heart-warming book but you can save those tissues.  The  Notebook is far more heart-wrenching.	2000-08-15

The style  of the author was original and intriguing.  It begged me to read more and  find out what illicit intentions hung in the mind of Phineas Poe, the  victim of a rare sort of theft.  We are exposed to the horrors of a dark  trade and the heinous minds of individuals who had strayed too far from the  'normal' life.  Horror-fans, this is not what you think it to be.<br />Will's  narrative style was like some sort of a drug that coaxed and intoxicated  your mind as you passed your eyes over the first couple of chapters.  I  followed... but...<br />... I got confused along the way.  The appearance of  Isabel and Henry left me muddled as to what really was going on.  I no  longer knew who was the 'bad' guy and who was 'good'.  Also, the story  started to be a bit draggy.  Images of a very worn and dirty man who had no  idea what he was in didn't keep the storyline appealing anymore.  The sex  that occurred between the characters added no color nor meaning to the  plot.<br />It would also have been easier if conversations were marked in  quotation marks.  It could be quite a chore figuring things out for the  English-challenged crowd.<br />A slow-paced detective story, this would  enthrall you at first, but leave you rather dissatisfied.	2000-08-01

The plot is simple and the story tends to  drag and thus, slow moving.<br />Koontz does pay a lot of attention to details  and gives us a lot of insight to the characters, building them in every  aspect, which I appreciate. It is, however, rather testing to read the same  styles over and over again.<br />With False Memory, I'd expected a tale of  terror and horror beyond imagination but that never came. Supporters would  defend that the ailment, autophobia itself, or the terror of a home-torn  apart or a psychologist with ill-intentions on his patients' minds are what  entails the 'terror'.  If you want something to spook you, you'd be  disappointed.<br />On the whole, this is not a &quot;keep you on the  edge&quot; nor &quot;unable to put down&quot; kind of book.  The story  lends us a whole new look into uses and abuses in psychology and once  again, like many other tales, reminds us how important our loved ones are  to us, whether we're in need or not.<br />The bond between Dusty and Martie  would make one think &quot;where do I find someone like that?&quot; and  &quot;I hope I won't turn out like her&quot; with Dusty's mum, Claudette,  and finally &quot;I wish my pet is as smart as that&quot; with Valet, the  couple's 'child'.<br />All in all, a moderately interesting read.	2000-07-19

It was a warm day when I started on Bridget's diary and I spent the whole day in bed, sweating buckets to get through a year of her life!<br />Ms Jones' life brought smiles to my face and made me laugh like how I never thought I  would with a book.  Her frankness about her loves (Daniel) and hates  (herself?) thoroughly amused me and warmed my heart.  I squealed with her  when she got her &quot;ridiculous and meaningless commercial  exploitation&quot; from Daniel and mourned with her when the Blonde took  over.<br />I couldn't find any fault with this gem from Helen Fielding; the  entries were just how one would write into it: informal, broken English and  unfathomable slurs when one's too drunk.<br />Bridget represents so many  Singletons out there, pressurized to get attached and having to face the  hankering from over-caring relatives.  <br />You don't have to be a Singleton  to read it, and as it says, if you'd ever had a relationship or a mother,  you'd love this piece.	2000-06-27

It's about love.<br />The life of young Michael Berg is changed forever when he fell into the arms of Hanna Schmitz, a woman more than a decade older  than himself.<br />When she left him, he withdrew into his own self, developed  a hardness in himself, presumably to protect himself from further hurt and  later compared all his other lovers to his first one, Hanna.<br />Just how  much of ourselves do we see in Michael?  How many of us are withholding  ourselves, immersing our senses into work to numb ourselves and to ease the  hurt that's ever ready to pounce on us when we let our guard down for just  a little?<br />Bernhard Schlink painted a dark picture of love went wrong; a  life whose happiness had been snatched away because one had closed himself  up for too long and avoided what his heart told him for fear of pain.<br />If  there's one thing to learn from The Reader, it's to face up to the hurt and  grow from it, which Michael had clearly failed.<br />Not a totally easy book  to read but the words therein contained a valuable lesson that we should  seek to understand.	2000-06-26

An interesting non-fiction book on &quot;the extraordinary sex lives of ordinary people&quot;.<br />Perhaps it's the openness in our society now, but I've failed to see what was so &quot;extraordinary&quot; about the sex  lives of the people in the book.<br />Take Marie, a hairdresser who encouraged  her husband to look for sex with others during her pregnancy, albeit  jokingly, and got what she wanted.  It is in my opinion that such things  are happening all around us and that there is nothing shocking or alarming  to it.<br />Guys and girls looking for a partner but at the same time sleeping  around, women trying to find a husband and going through relationships that  fail one after another; these are all nothing 'extraordinary'.  I would  think that the 'e' word was used with injustice for this book.<br />The main  theme of the book is not about sex, but the role of it and how sex changes  a relationship and the dating game. <br />I got tired of the book after awhile  and there is nothing &quot;funny&quot; in it, as the backcover claimed.  It  is, however, fast moving but not an easy read.<br />Read this to help you get  to sleep.	2000-06-23

Her  happiness is tainted when her own curiosity of her husband's past gives way  to gory events that she never expected.<br />I felt greatly grieved at how the  story went.  A believer in love myself, I felt happy for Alice to have  found such a man who would love her and take care of her forever.  I  couldn't help shedding a couple of tears at how their love had to  end.<br />This tale is intricately weaved and you would find it hard to put  down this book.  Every character is an important clue to the mystery which  you think is really not much of a mystery, at first.<br />There are things in  the story which reminded me of a &quot;real&quot; life - friends to fall  back on, moving ourselves out of the comfort zone in pursuit of what we  want, loving and being loved.<br />It all just seems almost real to me, the  anxiety, the tension, the fear.  I feel so moved by it all that I wish it  would have gone better for Alice and Adam. <br />There is just so much to tug  at your heartstrings that I can only say, READ THIS BOOK.<br />Great one,  Nicci.	2000-06-19

How is It going to get her?  Will she be free before It gets to her?<br />Gerald's  Game is not your usual horror-thriller creation that is so Stephen  King-like.  It is almost bare of supernatural stuff but the quest for  survival and the voices of a deranged mind makes you want to read for  more.<br />The storyline deals with one's skeleton in the closet.  How long  are we willing to keep it in ourselves and let it eat into us before we'd  seek help in ridding it?  The heroine in the story learns the path to  recovery the hard way.<br />King has made the voices in Jessie's head a  character on their own and it was easy to picture Goody (plump  housewifish-looking, pink cheeks?), Ruth (hippy-type, long hair, ciggie on  her lips?) and Punkin (cute little innocent girl?), who all add much color  to the tale.<br />Although I wasn't very caught up in the book (it didn't make  me want to know what Jessie was going to do next to save herself - that  almost became a bore itself), it was interesting to read once I could get  myself down to the book again.<br />Low chill factor, but the end which  culminates to the heroine's victory is heart-warming.	2000-06-16

When they do eventually meet up again, she was engaged but she still  thought fondly of him.  Their attraction to each other the 2 days they were  together proved to be beyond what they could control.  What would happen to  them?<br />A very simple story which is told with such ease that it made me  flip page after page and never was tired of the story.<br />The events  unfolded were quite predictable and made the &quot;ideal fairy-tale&quot;  story that we all hope would happen, usually.  But it wasn't a drag to  read.  In fact, I guess it would do many of us good to read such a simple  love story again for most of us are probably lost in the fast-pace world  around us, never having the time to stop and savour the finer things in  life - in this case, love at its ultimate.<br />A sad tinge in the story makes  one both sympathize and yearn for Noah, for the love he has and for the one  that he loves.  <br />Do miracles happen?

I knew who was behind it without needing to finish the book.<br />This is my first Dean Koontz book.  I like what I read but the plot was simple and it failed to prove me wrong on my judgement.<br />6 years after 3 year-old  Melanie gets abducted by her father, her mum, Laura, gets woken up in the  dead of night to find her husband, Dylan, brutally murdered in his  apartment.<br />Even though mother and daughter reunites, more deaths follow  and Melanie, in her stupor from being a prisoner for so long, reveals that  after all the men are dead, she would go too.  <br />Who is going to stop this  thing from getting to her and who on earth is capable of such demonic force  on the people?<br />A very gripping tale that makes you want to read right on,  chapter after chapter.  I found it hard to put down the book as the story  flowed smoothly and easily.<br />It's not very spooky but the brutality  portrayed in the story makes you roll your eyes in horror.  There's a light  element of mystery, mostly regarding what the Door of December really is.   Also, the wonders of science are presented here and it makes one rethink  the moral issues that surround the acts of testing and experiments.<br />As  you read, there's little doubt as to what/who the murderer could be.   That's where the story failed.  Otherwise, a good book.	2000-06-13

What's to become of them?<br />The attractive theme of the book called out to me and I must admit that the  story is rather unusual and strangely narrated.<br />Highly descriptive of the  environment in the tale being told, it will prove to be a bore to those not  interested in botany/zoology/geography/etc as detailed landscape  descriptions stretch through pages.<br />A slow-paced tale which recounts the  past lives of the characters, which makes one wonder why the history is  even brought up, perhaps only to give the book its length.  There is no  plot, no definite end to the story and no murderer to be  captured.<br />Perhaps the book is here to tell us how life, death and love  are all bond together in one life, how people prefer to die, how love lives  on even after death.<br />However, the contents within the covers are quickly  forgotten, for even though I'd just completed the book 15 minutes ago, the  most vivid thing that remains in my mind about the story was how crabs,  gulls and flies had feasted on Celice and Joseph.<br />Read only if you can  tolerate long descriptive texts and consider yourself romantic; skip this  if you're looking for something solid to hold you through to the end.	2000-06-08

The story was very smooth flowing; the plot simple yet mysterious.

The bear is running after Bertie and the rest of the people in the castle are trying to scare the bear away by making a lot of noise!<br />The Admiral with his gong, the Captain with a horn, the General with a flute and many  others teach children the different kinds of sounds that are produced with  different sources.<br />Great illustrations accompany the story and the story  ends funnily and happily.<br />Wonderful book for kids and educators.	2000-06-06

This book is a collection of his short stories and a few of which I find quite creative, such as &quot;Changes&quot; and &quot;The White  Road&quot;.  The story in the prologue meant to be a wedding gift got me  pretty hyped about the rest of the book.<br />I am not a fan of werewolf  stories, and his shots at a couple didn't win me over.  I'd failed to  appreciate &quot;The Goldfish pool and other stories&quot;, which I think  dragged for too long.  I'm left with about 80 pages of the book and I'm no  longer interested in reading more.<br />I feel that some of the stories needed  to be further developed, such as &quot;One life, furnished in early  Moorcock&quot;, which left me wondering, what is the story going on about?   Such was also the sentiment for the above mentioned &quot;Goldfish&quot;  story.<br />Chill factor, pretty low, but I think the characters must have  slipped into my subconscious, for I had a couple of spooky dreams after I  read the books before going to sleep.  Read this in your spare time only.	2000-05-31

I expected it to be good, and it did not fail me.<br />Dolores Price, the star of the book, grows up watching her mother coming under the tyranny of her father.  When her  family fell apart, she had to tolerate life living with her grandma (mum's  mum) and almost crazy mother.<br />An unfortunate incident with her grandma's  tenant changes her life drastically.  Dolore's mother tries hard to help  her by feeding her lots of junk food and letting her watch TV all  day.<br />Dolores grows into a 257 pounds lady and her weight causes her to be  an outcast in school and later on, college.  Real help came only when she  was on the verge of suicide.<br />How did she manage to turn her life around?  Please read it to find out.  A very easy reading and delightful story that  would keep you captivated from the start.  Dolores seems just like what  anyone can be - having unresolved issues, emotional luggage, leading to  breakdown, help comes, getting back on our feet.<br />We might not identify  with all her problems, but we can sympathise with the pain she goes  through, the loneliness and sadness caused from the lack of parental  pressence, her triumph over her fears.<br />Heart-warming.  Must read.	2000-05-24
US	51191272	R2NANOP3WCMQL4	0064434834	6098637	Edwina the Emu	Books	3	4	19	N	N	Awful Pics	The cover of the book is not really attractive and neither are those within.  Kids might get frightened of the big green ugly bird on the cover and refuse to read.<br />Contents-wise, the story is written in rhymes, good  way to introduce children to that genre and poetry.<br />Children are also  introduced to various kinds of occupations and realize in the end that it  is important to share responsibilities.  Good value for children.	2000-05-16
US	51191272	RQMDVEI2FNMAR	0140547126	410103698	There's a Nightmare in My Closet	Books	4	6	10	N	N	Cute but...	A rather cute book designed to help kids cope with their fear of monsters (under their beds, in the closets, wherever) in a cutesy way.<br />The illustrations are mediocre but children would laugh their way through about the monsters.  The text is very simple (a line per page) and budding  readers would appreciate that.<br />However, parental guidance should be given  about the use of guns/rifles to deal with things the kids may not like.   That point aside, a worthwhile book to help your kids get interested in  reading.	2000-05-16
US	51191272	R16PFP0U31IWIB	067102423X	85988614	Bag of Bones	Books	5	2	2	N	N	Enthralling	I am a fan of horror stories.  I love horror movies and I'm usually found at the Horror section in bookstores.  Although I have not read many of King's books, I like his work.<br />This book captures your attention right  from the start.  A first person narration of the story gives it a personal  touch.  You feel for Noonan, you feel for his wife Jo, you pity  Mattie.<br />The vivid descriptions of the scenes make one feel as if you are  there as it happened.  The storyline is superb, it makes you want more.  It  makes you want to lie in bed all day to find out what new horrors Noonan  discovered in his home, who was Sara Tidwell, what Devore and his  right-hand man would do to get Kyra...  At every alternate bend on the  road, you would discover pieces of a puzzle that had to be put together.   Picking up each piece left by his dead wife along the way, you would be as  eager as Noonan to find out exactly how the whole picture looked like.<br />In  the one week that I took to complete the book, I had dark sneaky thoughts  in my mind when I turned off the lights to go to bed after reading the  book.  Somehow I felt I was part of the story and the spooks had creeped  out to get me.<br />All in all, the horror factor was not very high but the  mystery surrounding the characters kept you going. A truly captivating  read.	2000-04-21
US	51191272	R1NG9C5WYJ4YKN	0684872153	698161422	Angela's Ashes:  A Memoir	Books	3	1	1	N	N	Try it Yourself	It was the rave reviews on the back of the book which persuaded me to buy the book.  I am always out to read experiences or stories that are unusual and extraordinary and the reviews cried out, &quot;This is IT! &quot;<br />I  was quite surprised as I read the first few pages.  Firstly, the English  was not standard.  Secondly, there were no punctuation marks which  indicated which parts were speech.  Many atimes I had to reread certain  sentences to get things straight.<br />Technicalities aside, the story was  marginally funny and Frank McCourt's life is quite a sight to behold when  he was a child.  If you want a taste of how difficult life can be, Frank is  the man for you.<br />Although Frank's relatives were not fully developed, you  can picture in your head his almost always drunken father, pitiful mother,  scrawny and hunched-back grandmother, generously-fleshed Aunt Aggie and the  lovable Uncle Pa.<br />See Frank as he nurses his twin brothers as a 4 year  old, steal his first apple and almost die from typhoid.  As with all  growing pains, watch him learn about the &quot;excitement&quot; and be  there with him as he experienced it first with a girl on Carmody  Street.<br />A fine piece of work, very educational.  Pity the punctuation.	2000-04-21

Short segments of itdepicting a certain incident that happened in Totto-Chan's life.  I thought it would be a good read.<br />I was wrong.  Perhaps I had wanted something more challenging to my intellect or maybe I did not appreciate the ideas and methodology of the Head-Master in the story. I found the story segments easy to read but the content too shallow. Moreover, some of the mini-stories had no relation to the story as a whole, eg, the part where Totto-Chan talked about visiting her dad's violin practise.<br />There is little value that we can adopt into our lives.  For one, our education system does not permit such flexibility like that of the school Totto-Chan attended and children in each society are different.<br />The saving grace for the book is the personality of the Head-Master and what he did and how he treated the students.<br />This book is good for those who want a simple book to read during short breaks but not for those who desire a storyline to follow.	2000-04-21
