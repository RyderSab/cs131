Golan Trevize, continuing from FOUNDATION'S EDGE, undertakes a mission to finally discover the \\"mythical\\" planet Earth, and to learn its secret. Accompanying him are fellow Foundationer Janov Pelorat and Bliss of Gaia. If you're a fan of all the above-mentioned series, your suspense will be keen as Trevize and co. narrow down the search. What was Earth's ultimate fate? We know it became radioactive (seen in ROBOTS AND EMPIRE, and touched on in various Galactic Empire novels), but did it recover? Are people still living there?<br /><br />Along the way, the trio discover several of the ancient \\"Spacer\\" worlds (the basis for many of the Robot novels), and on one of them, Solaria, they take with them a \\"girl\\" who has developed (like all the few remaining Solarians) remarkable powers. What may be a \\"let down\\" to many FOUNDATION fans is that Seldon's plan is clearly shown to be intertwined -- nay, guided -- by probably the most powerful robot of all, now an ancient, worn down figure. It's touched on that there will soon be a joining of robot and human, in the form of the little Solarian girl.<br /><br />Trevize doesn't \\"resolve\\" the dispute of Galaxia vs. Individuality (continued from EDGE); however, the novel ends with him pondering what humans will ultimately become, with his gaze firmly on the little Solarian \\"girl.\\"	2005-05-17

Like another reviewer stated, the first third of the book is what makes the novel OK overall: The planet is essentially locked in a First vs. Third World conflict, as technology has made the former's society a &quot;universal welfare state&quot; due to &quot;nanoforges,&quot; which can essentially make anything. Want in the First World has been expunged. However, the Third World has no (or little) access to the nanoforges, and has launched a global guerrilla war as a result (or so it seemed to me). However, it's pretty obvious that Haldeman wants to place blame on the North (First World) as unwilling to share its monopoly on the nanotech, and demonstrates this not-so subtlely throughout the first third of the book. (It was interesting to read his knowledge of Costa Rica as that's my second home.) Implications that the North planned nuclear destruction of its own city and other conspiracies are numerous. Maybe Haldeman's Vietnam experience is responsible for this, and is understandable.<br />I was disappointed by what seemed Haldeman's favorable position towards the ultimate &quot;peace.&quot; Forcible brain-washing? Come ON! It says something that I found myself agreeing w/the contemptible Ingram in that the &quot;humanizing&quot; procedure &quot;takes away our humanity!&quot; As another reviewer said, it's incredible that the biggest dissenters to the &quot;humanizing&quot; would be some fringe rightist religious cult. No way, man. I'd be right in there protesting too.<br />I thought the side premise of the Jupiter Project was intriguing; I actually found myself wishing more would be elaborated on that. Oh well.	2004-01-25
US	41542292	R3L44HRKNVMPIC	0441007872	332040900	Forever Free	Books	3	1	2	N	N	Not nearly on par w/the original	Regardless of what happened in it, I *was* looking forward to this sequel to one of my all-time favorite novels, THE FOREVER WAR. William Mandella is one of my fave characters. But in FOREVER FREE, he is turned into Mr. Everyman -- he is no longer the &quot;beat-the-odds-beyond-all-imagination&quot; soldier from the first book. He spends his days fishing, staying warm on perpetually cold Middle Finger, chewing the fat w/Marygay, his children and friends, and -- oh yeah -- eventually he decides he hates his life (imposed by &quot;Man&quot;) so he wants to hijack a spaceship, spend a decade in it at virtual light-speed, and come back to Middle Finger (or Earth) some 40K years later objective time.<br />The plot to nab the ship is believable enough, and executed fairly well, but it is not very suspenseful. The journey does indeed go awry, and when the crew heads back to M.F., there are no traces of civilization anywhere. Ditto for Earth. Wha-a-a...? The &quot;answer&quot; seems so hastily put together as to evoke a big &quot;AW, C'MAHN!!&quot; I actually *liked* the premise, but Haldeman could have spent more pages developing *it* instead of the boring existence of M.F. Or the stealing of the spaceship.<br />IMO, if you liked (loved) FOREVER WAR, this *may* disappoint, but it is nevertheless a fairly interesting read on the continuing life of the WAR's survivors.	2004-01-15

Once more, Goldberg is no right-winger by any means. He's a traditional liberal with over 25 years experience in the &quot;mainstream&quot; media (mostly with CBS). And, he reiterates that he doesn't think there's some &quot;leftist elite conspiracy&quot; to skew news coverage -- it's just that elite journalists are so insulated from most of &quot;real&quot; America that they truly believe their views (liberal) are the norm, and that ideas to the contrary are odd, in the minority, and even dangerous. Why else identify politicians and advocates as &quot;conservative&quot; at a rate magnitudes greater than their liberal counterparts? Why else go to NOW (National Organization of Women) or the NAACP or People for the American Way as &quot;experts&quot; in their fields -- without balancing their views with those groups' conservative counterparts?<br />This time out, Goldberg includes interviews with Tim Russert and Bob Costas (whom Goldberg considers two of the more balanced news/sports-guys) about the bias problem, and at book's end offers several chapters of solutions to the elite media's problem. One of these chapters even suggests that Brokaw, Jennings, Rather and co. move their news operations to a Middle American city so that they'll be more &quot;in tune&quot; with average Americans. It sounds humorous at first, but ends up making a hell of a lot of sense!<br />If you liked BIAS, you'll definitely enjoy this second part.	2003-11-14

Passages on the time-traveling South Africans are kept to a minimum, so hard sci-fi'ers may be disappointed here. This book is more for history buffs.<br />Questions: Would Lee and the South have been as willing to change their slavery views had they not stumbled upon the trove of books that they did?<br />Why weren't the South Africans more subtle -- thus, more influential -- in their attempts to control Southern politics? With the power at their disposal, what they resorted to seemed outright silly.	2003-09-29

Marvel's most popular -- and infamous -- interstellar races, the Kree and the Skrulls, are going at it yet again, and this time Earth is caught square in the middle (literally -- it's at the midway point between both empires, although astronomy buffs know this is actually silly!)<br />The Kree Supreme Intelligence, even though a captive of the malevolent Kree Ronan the Accuser, has used his mental might to maneuver one Rick Jones into his possession. He unlocks Jones' \\"Destiny Force\\" (whose effects are played to much greater detail in \\"Avengers Forever\\") to ultimately quell the cosmic war and become the rightful Kree ruler again.<br />Featuring guest stars out the wazoo (Captain Marvel, The Inhumans, Super Skrull), this compilation also showcases one of the greatest artists of all time, Neal Adams, as well as one of the premier scripters, Roy Thomas. This is easily in the top three Avengers stories of all time, if not THE best.	2003-03-18

Kurt Busiek, the modern master of continuity, teams with one of the best modern artists, Carlos Pacheco, to weave a \\"can't-put-the-book-down-till-I'm-done\\" monumental story. Like the great \\"Kree-Skrull War\\" of the early 70s, the key character is Rick Jones, whose dormant mental power (first awakened in the K-S War) is deemed a threat to all existence. Avengers from past, present and future are whisked together to team with Kang the Conqueror to stop Kang's \\"older wiser\\" self Immortus and the so-called Time-Keepers from extinguishing \\"threatening\\" timelines in which the Avengers have become a destructive force.<br />Busiek oozes respect and admiration for those creators who have come before him, and does an incredible job tying loose ends together from Avengers' past history (especially with regards to the Vision and Original Human Torch, and the wretched \\"Crossing\\" from various titles' waning volume 1 issues). Pacheco's phenomenal art (inked by the equally talented Jes&uacute;s Merino) clearly shares a Neal Adams component (who drew the Kree-Skrull War) with an exquisite attention to the most minute detail.<br />If you only buy one TPB a year -- or ever -- THIS is the one to get, folks.	2002-10-27

Surely, Sammon is not exactly objective (he works for the Washington Times), but it IS refreshing to read/hear an account that doesn't portray GW Bush as the 2000 election \\"usurper.\\"<br />Perhaps most telling is Sammon's analysis of 2000 election night coverage by the big networks. The disparity between the talking heads' projections for Gore and Bush is, well, astounding. Gore was projected a state's winner mere minutes after said state's polls closed -- even if he had only a small one-digit lead -- while Bush was projected a state's winner some THIRTY minutes after polls closed....even while maintaining a DOUBLE-DIGIT lead. Sammon makes the easily persuasive case that this lead to the Florida debacle. Florida spans TWO time zones, and the networks hastened to call Florida for Gore right after the *eastern* time zone polls closed -- but while the *central* time zone polls still had an hour to remain open. Voters in the central zone (mostly in the Florida panhandle), upon hearing this projection, either got out of the voting line to go home, turned around in their cars while driving to the polls, or never even bothered going to the polls at all....figuring \\"Why bother? Gore's already won.\\" Indeed. Sammon conservatively estimates that this early media projection cost Bush some 10,000 panhandle votes, especially since these Florida counties are heavily Republican.<br />The ballot recount fiasco is nicely detailed as well. After reading the accounts, one should never doubt why the US Supreme Court rebuked the Florida Supreme Court not once, but twice (another fact that has been forgotten -- by a 9-0 vote, the USSC vacated the FLSC's earlier rulings in favor of Gore, and then when the FLSC unbelievably ruled for Gore again in the contest phase later, this led to the 7-2 USSC vote that the ballot recounts were unconstitutional). Sammon notes that the Democrats' plan was to imprint on the nation that the USSC \\"elected\\" Bush by a 5-4 vote (once it was finally over for Gore), overlooking the earlier 9-0 and 7-2 USSC votes against Gore as well. The 5-4 USSC vote, as most know, was to halt further recounts. But Sammon addresses the majority's reasons in this decision and perhaps the most telling is that even with a possibly unconstitutional extension of the December 12 deadline to Dec. 18 for seating electors, the possibility that all of Florida's ballots could be recounted -- for like the 4th or 5th time, in some cases -- was remote. And still -- some ballots would STILL be given more of an examination than others, a violation of the 14th amendment as the USSC had already ruled.<br />Sammon's writing style is engaging and enjoyable. I finished the book in two evenings. I now look forward to reading an opposite account to get the view from Gore's side so I can then make a balanced judgment as to which camp was more \\"at fault.\\"ruled for Gore again in the contest phase later, this led to the 7-2 USSC vote that the ballot recounts were unconstitutional).

We have a memorial of Abraham Lincoln in the middle of Washington D.C. Has he earned it? Author Thomas J. DiLorenzo probably would say &quot;absolutely not.&quot; DiLorenzo's historical analysis actually should not come as much of a surprise at all -- he has meticulously researched this topic. For instance, it should be no surprise that the Lincoln administration severely infringed on civil rights during the War Between the States. Mere critics of Lincoln were summarily jailed and even exiled (such as the most vocal Lincoln opponent, Clement Vallandigham). Also, the South had legitimate grievances that should have -- could have -- been settled peacefully, including, certainly, slavery. Lincoln's love affair with Hamilton-esque Whiggery was a major point of contention of the two (North and South) regions. Southerners opposed this system of high tariffs, a national banking system, and [federal] subsidies for internal improvements. Lincoln also believed that the right of secession -- virtually considered sacrosanct until his administration -- was not a &quot;right&quot; at all, and that the states &quot;existed at the behest of the federal government.&quot; This, DiLorenzo argues, is so contrary to the established principles of the American Founding as to defy description.<br />What may be surprising are some of the conclusions DiLorenzo has drawn from his research. He makes the (very persuasive) case that Lincoln alone is responsible for the virtual demise of Jeffersonian and Jacksonian federalism. Historians can trace the centralization of power in Washington D.C. right to Lincoln. He indicts Lincolnian policies as &quot;mercantilist,&quot; equating them with the economics of the European powers of the [then] recent past and present. Regarding slavery, the author states that Lincoln had no real interest in emancipation, and that the Emancipation Proclamation was merely a political gimmick. After all, it had no real power, and didn't even free those slaves in the North. He provides evidence that one of Lincoln's &quot;solutions&quot; to the slave &quot;problem&quot; was colonization -- that is, sending blacks back to Africa or other areas such as Haiti.<br />DiLorenzo concludes that war was not necessary to resolve the situation on the 1860s. Secession was a right established in the Founding, and the states that wished to secede should have been left alone to do so. Slavery could have (would have, actually) been done away with gradually through compensation as was the case in Europe and other areas in the Americas. Indeed, compensation would have cost the federal gov. MUCH less than what the Civil War had cost the country. (And not just in the number of dead, which DiLorenzo equates to 8 million total given the pop. of the US today.) Ultimately, if the South had been left alone, they would most likely have re-entered the Union at a later time since slavery would have been abolished -- peacefully -- and the North would have been tempered by the South's secession, and after a new evaluation of Jeffersonian principles.<br />Critics of Lincoln like DiLorenzo are not new, perhaps just obscure. I recommend reading the works of Frank L. Klement, who, some 40-50 years ago was considered &quot;a revisionist&quot; for his criticisms of Lincoln and his defense of &quot;Copperheadism.&quot;North.

This enlightening book serves to open one's eyes regarding polls, statistics and claims you'll hear on the nightly news, radio and newspaper. The authors' main thrust is that people should look into and understand the *methodology* of any such research/poll claims. \\"Be skeptical,\\" in other words. Peer review of statistical/research claims should be evident in order for any such claims to hold some validity. Various case studies are used throughout the book -- the \\"rise\\" of rates of infectious diseases, spouse \\"abuse,\\" education \\"results,\\" the environment, racial issues and \\"poverty,\\" just to name a few. Probably the most interesting chapter is the one on polls. The authors meticulously demonstrate that the mere *wording* of a poll can produce results that no one in their right mind would expect.

His argument is quite credible that, far from being concerned about the Bill of Rights for individuals, the ACLU delves head first into egalitarianism, embracing the creed of equal *group* rights that frequently contradict many of the Union's stated liberty values.<br />If the Union is so concerned about the Bill of Rights -- especially the 1st Amendment -- why doesn't it respect the rest of the Constitution's goals? For example, since the Bill of Rights was written as a guarantee of protection for the individual *from* government, how does the ACLU advocate that the 2nd Amendment is a *collective* right? Why does it consistently advocate governmental interference into the private sector at almost every turn in order to promote nebulous ideals? Donohue's exposing of the many 180 degree turns the Union has taken on various issues is a jaw-dropper.<br />I would have liked, perhaps, to have seen more of a balance as to what the ACLU has done *positively* w/regards to Donohue's selected topics. He basically cites only glossed-over generalities as to what the Union has done, usually in the opening paragraph of a chapter -- before diving right into the thrashing of his target. Sure, it's obvious what Mr. Donohue wants to do, but it would have read better, in my opinion, with more anecdotes from the other view.	2002-01-26

But unlike the usual conservative pundits who routinely remind folks of this, Goldberg is an insider -- and a *liberal* one at that. That's what makes his book all the more interesting. Goldberg notes numerous times that Rather, Jennings, et al most likely do not invoke their bias *consciously*; in fact, they, like most limosine big city liberals, simply think that the tilt they give the &quot;news&quot; is correct -- and that folks agree w/them.<br />I am sure many radicals and progressives out there will laugh and state what they always do -- that the big media are owned by corporations, and as such are inherently conservative. Goldberg addresses this too. The evening news doesn't *make* money! The big TV execs essentially don't care about the news' content b/c they'll make their buck elsewhere. And here, Goldberg notes how these superficial &quot;caring folk&quot; do a 180 degree turn in their &quot;news magazine&quot; shows. Here, big bucks *do* rule, and truth suffers as a result. Since white viewers bring in the most $$ from advertising, you'll see stories on &quot;48 Hours&quot; and &quot;20/20&quot; that feature white people -- in what are supposedly &quot;common&quot; circumstances, but in fact are extraordinary. One case in point: the nonsensical heterosexual AIDS &quot;epidemic.&quot;<br />Goldberg's story, in many ways, reminds me of Richard Bernstein's in _Dictatorship of Virtue_. Bernstein, another liberal, examined radical multiculturalism and political correctness across the nation...and in many cases he couldn't believe what he saw and heard. The difference here is that Bernstein (luckily, apparently) wasn't ostracized for his views like Goldberg was. Indeed, it seems to be a common theme among the liberal media elite -- tow the party line or become a non-person. Former radical David Horowitz explores this phenomenon in-depth in his autobiographical _Radical Son_ (among other works), and clearly Goldberg has fallen victim to its clutches.<br />Goldberg also states what clear-thinking people already know: that the continuing myopia of Rather and Co. has led to the incredible growth of folks like Rush Limbaugh and other talk radio voices, as well as cable news, Fox News in particular.<br />His style makes for interesting reading, although at times his use of the first person is a tad annoying, as is his liberal use of italics for re-emphasis.

This TPB collects this generous act by Richards, as well as the death and rebirth of Terrax the Tamer, his battle against Dr. Doom and the Silver Surfer, and the abduction and trial of Richards, for whom Galactus and Eternity themselves testify.	2001-11-26
US	41542292	R18N3WV3ORR4S3	0871352915	124472760	Iron Man: Crash	Books	4	3	3	N	N	Way ahead of its time -- at the time	This was the first-ever totally computer generated comic graphic novel, and it was done in the late 80s when computer technology was a piddly fraction of what it is today. One must be aware of this going in, or you'll be a bit disappointed. Nevertheless, technology lovers will salivate at the copious amount of tech talk between its pages. The premise is as follows: an aged Tony Stark is about to sell some of his most prized inventions to a Japanese competitor, against the wishes of one Nick Fury and SHIELD. Fury's concerns turn out to be valid, and Stark-Iron Man, along with a robotic Iron Man, set out to make things right. Unfortunately, the bad guys' contingency plan results in the robotic armor gaining sentience (current Marvel editor-in-chief Joe Quesada must've gotten ideas from this), and Stark has no choice but to let it be free. Leaves the door open for a sequel....?	2001-11-26

That aside, this TPB collects this duo's best-ever X-Men work, chronicling the seduction of Jean Grey's human soul to the cosmic entity known as the Phoenix. The drama is first-rate and the art is excellent. The &quot;Wolverine Alone&quot; section is sort of a misnomer: we actually only witness a few panels of the diminutive Canadian X-Man against the Hellfire Club mercenaries. The climax double-size section is superb, where a semi-coerced team of mutants (morally uncertain of defending Jean b/c of her annihilation of an entire planet as Dark Phoenix) battle the Shi'ar Imperial Guard. The ending panels are some of the best ever printed in comics; it's just a shame that Jean was &quot;brought back from the dead.&quot; But who, after all, ever *stays* dead in comics?	2001-11-26
US	41542292	R1PEAGRG9ECFUS	0441783589	242880671	Starship Troopers	Books	5	2	4	N	N	Superb for any era	What I found most enjoyable in this book was not the all-out action (which was excellent), but the thought-provoking political philosophy stitched throughout the narrative. Nostradamus -- meet Robert Heinlein, who in this 1959 novel has nailed the social scene of the United States (and many other decaying or soon-to-be decaying Western nations). The last planetary war resulted in prisoners of war being abandoned by their countries, and veterans worldwide had enough. Slowly, these vets gain hold of power, and over the course of many years (Heinlein never says how many) a sort of &quot;military democracy&quot; emerges. Not only that, but a whole &quot;moral philosophy&quot; has been developed to explain how this system functions, and functions well.<br />As others have stated, those on the Left may guffaw at the whole notion (I tend to agree that its origins, at least, are dubious), but I feel Heinlein nails it when he explains that his society, despite its authoritarian nature, maintains all the freedoms enjoyed by the democracies of the modern era. In particular, why would people care overly much who presides over the system? Not many. Sure, the right to vote is restricted to only those who have served in the armed forces. How come? Only they have the necessary obligation -- duty -- to the &quot;whole&quot; and not just the individual. Interesting, to say the least. Fascist? Hardly. Is not the franchise restricted in the democracies of today? Of course. A 40-year old moron can vote, but an 11-year old genius cannot. What kind of sense does *this* make?<br />I could go on and on w/the clever proposals, but you get the idea. Heinlein even makes a completely different alien species very interesting, the so-called Pseudo-Arachnids, lovingly dubbed &quot;The Bugs.&quot; Just do yourself a favor -- avoid the wretched movie at all costs and just savor this novel.	2001-11-26

A bit of the material is dated (it was published in '96), so storylines like the Spider-Clone, the 2099 Universe, and the Avengers' &quot;Crossing&quot; may make some wince in sorrowful remembrance.

The question for its opponents (or those who would merely like to inject some common sense into it) is simply, \\"What can we do about it?\\" Or, more pessimistically,  \\"Is there anything we can do about it?\\" If one believes Lawrence Levine in The Opening of the American Mind, there's nothing to get uptight about. To him, multiculturalism is just an extension of the university's (and thus, academia's in general) continuing evolution. This indeed may be true; however, Levine, while claiming the academy \\"has always been political,\\" conveniently glosses over modern (ideological) multiculturalism's [more and more] overt leftist agenda. And, he appears to contradict himself: while praising the increasing \\"openness\\" of the university, he blatantly fails to see the \\"clamp down\\" on dissenting political views - that is, views deemed \\"insensitive\\" (in the university's overused jargon) to any group that campus leaders declare.<br /><br />Levine chides critics of the modern university saying they foster fears of \\"an eroding hierarchy and the encroachment of democratic society into the academe...\\" How does Levine define \\"democratic?\\" Most folks equate democracy with freedom, which includes freedom of thought. Ideological multiculturalism, however,  does not allow for this facet of democracy; in fact, it has more in common with the former East Bloc definition of \\"democracy,\\" which was an oxymoron. Apparently as an example of this \\"new\\" democracy, Levine states that the university \\"is one of the more successfully integrated and heterogeneous institutions in the United States.\\" He notes that Berkeley has gone from 68.6 percent white in 1974 to 32.4 percent now; but in addition, the number of Asians increased almost 25 percent over the same time frame, while Hispanics increased over 10 percent and blacks 1.1 percent. What Levine never touches is a prominent reason why these numbers changed so dramatically - and this is true for campuses nationwide: preferential admissions policies based on race. A better example of the \\"new\\" democracy would be the military or even professional sports where merit and hard work still are held in esteem. How boring would sports be if teams had to meet racial requirements like universities? And even now, at Berkeley and other institutions (especially in California), Asians are suffering the fate of being \\"over-represented.\\"<br />Speaking of \\"requirements,\\" Levine exhaustively details why it's no big deal that Western Civilization courses are no longer mandatory, yet there's no word as to why multicultural requirements now exist in place of \\"Western Civ.\\" He demonstrates that Stanford's Western Civ-replacing C.I.V. program has readings such as Ariel by Jos&eacute; Enrique Rod&oacute; and Account of the Conquest of Mexico by Bernal D&iacute;az and claims that these are what critics like William Bennett and Dinesh D'Souza are upset about. Hardly. Levine, who says he despises anecdotal evidence, cleverly uses it here. Ariel and Account are far from left-wing ideological readings (I know - I've read them). He plainly refuses to discuss what Bennett and D'Souza actually criticize - material like I, Rigoberta Menchu.<br /><br />Levine \\"catches\\" himself at one point during research on African-American writers, claiming,  \\"I soon realized that I was falling into the same pattern of allowing leadership to speak for followers.\\" Interesting. What do we see on campus today? \\"Leaders\\" within the university and student groups \\"deciding\\" what's best for their followers. Levine can easily lament his error; on the other hand, folks like Alan Gribben at the University of Texas suffer a lifetime ostracism merely for voicing a protest against the \\"prevailing sensitivity.\\"  Levine further says that \\"those who oppose current developments in higher education have been more successful outside than inside the universities.\\" Why is this? Is it because those that advocate the \\"current developments\\" are of like mind and ideology and work tooth and nail to silence the opposition (like Mr. Gribben)? Wouldn't it make sense that opponents of the \\"current developments\\" would have to look elsewhere to voice their views other than in the academic \\"ivory tower?\\"<br /><br />Levine also spends a lot of time claiming that the university mirrors the \\"real world\\" - it *is* the real world, he says. But is it really? Poll after poll shows that a majority of the American population considers themselves politically \\"moderate to conservative.\\" On the other hand, a professor who overtly claims that political ideology will more often than not find it difficult to advance his career in the realm of the university. Most Americans believe in achievement through merit,  not preferential treatment based on race; yet here, too, the university sets itself apart from the \\"real world.\\" An interesting section in Levine's book is where he takes a jab at Lynn Cheyney for claiming \\"today's students can disagree with professors. But to do so is to take a risk.\\" He asks, \\"When was it not risky for a socialist student to confront her economics professor....for an atheist to confront his religion professor...?\\" Indeed, this is true, and of course a student should have a right to feel comfortable in expressing his or her opinion. But look at the above again carefully - a socialist or an atheist was then, and is now, clearly part of a small minority of the American population. What we see on campus today,  however, are students who share the views of the majority of the American public who are reluctant to express their views in the classroom. Doesn't this seem a bit strange?<br /><br />I believe the fact that ideological multiculturalism is contrary to the views of most Americans is what will eventually lead to its demise. I've continually used &quot;ideological&quot; before &quot;multiculturalism&quot; with good reason. Most people would not deny, given the rapid demographic changes in our country, that multicultural studies are appropriate and a good idea. It's only when leftist ideology-masquerading-as-multiculturalism comes into play that the general public starts objecting. As a result, the primary  solution to combating ideological multiculturalism is to expose it. Richard Bernstein's (Dictatorship of Virtue) stories of Alan Gribben and the Committee for Quality Education in Brookline, Massachusetts are perfect examples. But it isn't easy. Any \\"dissenters,\\" as the above folks will testify, must be prepared to face attacks possibly more fierce than those directed against a presidential candidate! These attacks usually will not address the subject matter but will be quite personal. After all, as Richard Bernstein notes, the ideological multiculturalists are most \\"virtuous;\\" to object to them makes one evil incarnate.sities.\\" Why is this?

Schlesinger isn't just &quot;another conservative&quot; lamenting the onslaught of multiculturalism. He genuinely believes in the now out-of-vogue &quot;melting pot&quot; vision of America, which obviously infuriates many modern liberals. After all, &quot;melting pot&quot; implies &quot;white&quot; and &quot;male.&quot; Heaven forbid. Arguably, the most important aspect of the melting pot vision is the governmental and legal system of the United States. Modern liberals and various interest groups are trying to change this presently (which is their right, of course), but disturbingly trying to also rewrite its history. For instance, as Schlesinger writes, the New York State curriculum has mandated that study of the American Founding include reference to the &quot;Haudenosaunee political system&quot; -- in effect, the Iroquois Confederation. Schlesinger correctly notes that this &quot;influence&quot; on the Constitution's Framers was &quot;marginal,&quot; and on European intellectuals it was non-existent. (After all, wasn't it virtually only Ben Franklin's quote, after visiting the Iroquois, that said essentially, &quot;If they can do [create a confederation], why can't we?&quot;) But, no other state has as effective an Iroquois lobby as New York.	2001-11-24

The Colonists all got to sleep in suspended animation. Crew began to think this was inherently an unfair situation -- they do all the work, and then the Colonists get to enjoy the fruits of their labor upon arrival at the new colony. So they devised the &quot;Covenant of Planetfall&quot; which stratified society into the privileged (Crew) and the common (Colonist). Organ Banks exist to serve the Crew -- and most the Bank's organs come from Colonists!

The living armor's origins are pretty apocryphal (the &quot;Y2K bug?&quot; Come ON!), but it gets pretty spooky when the armor gets nasty -- in particular when it &quot;deposits&quot; Tony Stark on a desert island so that he can ponder whether he should join w/the armor or not!<br />The events of this TPB are being expounded upon in Iron Man's title even now, so many of its aspects may be rendered moot.	2001-10-10
