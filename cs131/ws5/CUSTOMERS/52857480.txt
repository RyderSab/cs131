Not that this was not a good book but Eric can and has done so much better in the past. The story line was very good .<br />It has gotten hard for me to reccomend his work now to both of the bookclubs I am a member of. They are just not interested.<br />I am one that continue to support his work. I guess he will always be one of my favorite authors but I have to be fair and say I expected more. I have all of Eric's novels  and have read all but one of his books. While Theives Paradise did not appeal to me I bought it anyway to go in my tbr pile. I had very  high hopes and thought this one would be a pageturner. The story was good but I felt he just drug it out to much. Once I got near the end of the story you could not drag me away . <BR>I just wonder what has happened to the Eric I know and enjoyed. Perhaps it's  me  <BR>I'll give this one  3.8 but not 4* . <br /> Eric , I agree Another Woman's Husband would have been the better title. Now I am very anxious to read what Shonda Cheeks has to say in her titled book. <br />This was a  good read just now one of your best. It might be hard to get your books when they first come out especially when I can not get the best discount price. <br />Just to think I was to anxious to read this one. I am so grateful my daughter gave it to me as a Mother's Day gift. <BR> <BR>But I still luvya ! :)	2003-05-26

Andria and Raushaun's past was very interesting and I could hardly put the book down at times. Then it took a turn for the least. Being the trip to Grenada with Mr. and Mrs. Persaud.<BR> This is when I lost some interest, Then when I heard the actual Blackfunk experience I regain interest again . Especially  listening to Tyrone and what happened to Paula my interest was up again  until the end. <BR> <BR>Sometimes I would get lost in the storyline trying to figure out who and what was going on. <br />I will admit it was a very steamy, sometimes arousing erotic story which I loved those parts. <BR> <BR>Now having read the first book I am not sure if Blackfunk gets any better? <BR>I might give it another try. <BR>Perhaps book two is better. <br />Black funk was not a bad book I just hope it would have been better. <BR>Michael this one I'll give 3.5*<br /> Good but just not all that I had hoped from the synposis.	2003-03-09

Sasha had  no respect or very  little for  herself .<br />It appeared she was a magnet for unavailable men.<br /> First Cole a marriage man, then her boss which had a fiance, then when she met Trent.<br />Whom  she was not willing to tell him about the ghosts that haunted her.<br />She stood a better change with Trent especially since he loved her. This is a  Must Read and a 5* in my book . I can hardly wait for this author's next book. It was a twisted story but one I enjoyed to the fullest. Did I mention it was a pageturner which was steaming with love scenes.	2002-04-25

Having read Chocolate Star I was quite excited and anxious to see what  was going to be up. I enjoyed reading each of the sistah parts  as it related to the novel . Keisha, Topaz, Nina, and  Jade,eached shared there relationships.  I was quite amazed with  the creeping, sleeping, secrets. No I am not telling who was creeping , why, and what the secrets were.  I kept wondering if the secrets were going to be revealed.<br /> When I got to the end I thought ooh there must me a sequel because there is  some unfinished businesses . Yes  Keisha and Eric were on the right track with the suspicions. Just when you think you have want you really want will trouble find them?	2002-04-18

I just finished <BR>reading Until Death Do Us Part and I have to say Micah can take care of business when no was else did. She had no shame in her game and she took care of business . Dominque you got yours . I hope I have not given away to much  of the story .  <br /> Now I want to say want a love Noah and Andrea had it truly was Until Death Do Us Part and then some. Noah is a man I'm sure we would love to love us. He had so much love for Andrea and he was not ashamed to show it or tell it. When she was killed by mistaken identity I could actually feel his pain. I really enjoyed the memoirs of Noah and Andrea more that the mystery parts. I would have prefered  reading the whole book about such great love. <BR>Having said all that I must admit I would actually rate this story with 3.5 or 3.8 * . I gave it 4 because I felt 3 * was to  low it was between 3.5 and 4* . I got lost in some of the mystery, but the love he had  for his wife was truly awesome.	2002-04-07

Does love live here anymore? <BR>Which is what I got from Love Don't Live Here Anymore. <BR>I can remember waiting anxiously for this novel to be release and I am so glad that I read it in a timely manner. If you have read the information and you are interested , then I would say you would love this one. LDLHA kept me wanting  to read more to see what would and did happen next. I really enjoyed the Mom and Dad story just as much. I did not find much of an ending to the story of either situation. I guess it was the assumption which was not what I would have wanted. The story was an enjoyable read . You just could tell what was going to happen all the time.  In my opinion I would give this one 4.5* .  A story about love, friendship, betrayal, and adultry on both parts. Does two wrongs really make a right. Will absence really make the heart go fonder or just  weary ?  Can the past destroy thirty -eight years of marriage? This one you will not want to miss.	2002-03-29

I really hesitant to say I was disappointed. Maybe this was just not a my kind of story.  I had hoped for another 5* read just as Trying to Sleep.... <BR>While it was an okay read it just lacked so much for me. <BR>I did enjoy reading the secrets unfold about the mother and seeing two sisters and an mom finally bonding. While it's not one of my kind of reads it was interested. I was reluctant to  give 4 stars only because it was worth more that 3 . I would  say 3.5 . <BR> Certainly a different kind of read it that makes any sense. I hope the duo get back  on track with the next book. I feel they can and will do better.	2002-03-22

It was a 4* read. It dealt with Love Ghosts-  unresolved  relationships from the past. <br />Sharon,as one reader refers to as the cry baby was certainly one. She was one that had a love ghost that haunted her and she was not willing to let it go. <br />Debra surprised me when he blamed herself for her husband's misgiving. She should have left him a lone time ago. <br />I was really surprised to see the mom had a love ghost and to act upon it after so many years. I was so glad when Sharon made up her mind and said no more would she participate in her mothers love ghost. Especially when she  had found a good man after so many years. <br />Sharon  got smart and turned lose of her love ghost and moved on. <BR>Kenneth was a guy so many of us would love to have. <BR>He had some patience to wait.  How many times can you find guys like Kenneth and the mom's second husband. Not to often. <BR>Then Linda finally got a grip and decided to marry Jay. Three sisters,a mom and the love ghosts from the past.	2002-03-08

Trying to pice up the pieces of broken hearts when their father walk out on the family some twenty years ago. <BR>While I was certainly rooting for Marcus .I could understand him the most and my heart went out to him. <BR>I could not understand Austin and his thinking for leaving his  wife and family. Could it have been history repeating it self? He had no reason to leave his wife and family. <BR>I did have sympathy for the father and some forgiveness,but I could not understand Caleb   and his thinking . He was the character that frustated me the most. I kept thinking would he ever learn. <BR>This was a great story showing how three brothers,and  a father affected by the decision  when the father left the family and marriage.   I would rate Rm Johnson,s debut novel with 4.5* and I look forward to reading the sequel The Harris Family soon.	2002-02-22

I have never read anything quite like this one. No where did I find a Chid of God in this dysfunctional family. The secrets untold and the things that were told surely takes functional out of this  dysfunctional family. <BR>This is one  story that will certainly keep your attention.

Dede was not a wise sistah when it came to love and her relationship with men. I could not believe she would give Stephan as many chances as she did. She remind me of a statement Stupid is as stupid does, or sometimes I'm stupid. <BR>She had a love for Stephen I would not wish on any one. I guess you can also say When a women is fed up there is nothing you can do. I was certainly hoping she would  hurry up and get to that point.  Just when you thought she was there think again. <BR>It is not that much love to let some one treat you that way. Elliot on the other hand  was a guy I would not let get away , especially on my part. <BR>When she found what she needed she gave it up only to be hurt again after so many times. <BR> I'll have to stop and say the novel started of slow for me and I was disappointed inwhich the way the story was told , I was sotimes confused and the errors ,... . <br />I had high hopes the editor would have done a better job. But in fact I think it was worst than the other two novels. <BR>Having say this I still gave it 4* , it was just not the easiest read. The last 2 hundred pages had me hooked I could not put it down. I had to find out what was going to happen next. <br />I do hope in the future Sonia find better editors. <BR>Sometime the errors do not bother me as much as  this one did. <BR>I loved Manhunt and Voodoo Love which I gave each 5* even with the errors but I will admit I could not give No More Love Making any more than 4* . <BR> I hope this does not come across as negative because I certainly did not mean for  it to appear this way, because I will be waiting for Sonia's next book .	2002-01-29

This is  just my opinion. I just finished reading Renee and Jay and while it was an entertaining and an okay read  it is in no way a page turner.<br />I will admit I was disappointed having paid hardcover prices for a non page turner especially having read the reviews first . I think I would have felt better had it been a tradesize book . I do appauld the author for his hard work and I think it would have been  better for me  if it was a tradesize book. <br />I could even suggest it to the bookclub members. Seeing they have a hard time purchasing  hc book I will have to pass on the suggestion.<br /> I'd suggest if you are interested wait for it to come out in tradesize next year.<BR>The story was entertaining and the author and his wife does make  a lovely couple . I hope this does not come across negative because it is in no way meant to be. It was a nice first try for a first time author  . I so often say Not all book will be 4 or 5* .

A triangle love story that you would not wish on any one.  This is my least favorite book of Eric's.  While I knew I was not going to love this story from the begining. The final ending of the story was redeemable. <br /> The story  started off slow and it was not going very far , I was wonder what has happened to my Eric. Then it picked up and took off and it left me with an emotionally charged story listening to  the narrator.  My heart went out to the narrator. Can a man want a woman that badly ? That can't be love.  To put up with and go thru the things he did.<br />How can one woman have such an affect on a man and a woman. This is a love you pray you never have. Alove to strong. While I did not like Nicole at all. As a reader stated she was such a selfish person. He wanted  him so Nicole by an means neccessary .   Come on Mr. Narrator you had to much love to give to some other deserving woman and he deserved better. <br />When it was said &quot;Pain is just weakness leaving your body &quot; I thought ,with an addiction like Nicole who needs love. <br />Those of you that are undecided about this book give it a chance.  It is redeemable, but I  do want the old Eric back ! Yes that's my boy and I will be waiting on  his next book . Not his best but a good read . <br /> While this book is certainly not for everybody, but if you are willing to take the challenge go for it . It is  a good read .  He does keep it real .

Sonny Washington, and even Bishop Otis Carrather surprised me.  It certainly proved that a Man is a Man. Even if he is  a preacher, or a bishop.  Can they not control themselves? There were some indiscretions and corruption going on at that Conference. Imagine  this taking place at in  funeral home. <br /> Wow, this is one you do not want to miss. See what those church folk were up to .	2001-07-27

I agree with one of the other reader's comments. &quot; I Wish  I Had a Red Dress&quot;  was no where near as great(  of a read ) as What Looks Like Crazy....... .  Pearl did an outstanding job with Ava and Eddie's story.  I'd expected the same .<br />I was hoping I Wish ....  the  sequel  would be just as great.   It briefly touched on Ava , Eddie  and the baby. <br />While this story was to be about Joyce and getting on with her life. It left me feeling her relationship with Nate was not at all what I had expected. <br />After reading  the story  I  thought it would have been a  much better idea for this book to be in tradesize ( book) compared to  the price of hardcover books. <br />I  also hope other readers do not come away  feeling  like I wish  I had ......, or  not ....  a Red  Dress  so soon  after reading it.	2001-07-23

Butterscotch Blues, is a heartwarming, heartbreaking, and  deep thought provoking read.  It make you think what if....  This story  showed how one sistah having so much love for a buttersctoch brotha. which caused her some Butterscotch blues in the end.  Sometimes I questioned the love Adrian had for Sandy but I never question the love she had for him . Especially the night she found him in the club with other women. <br />I am not sure he was the right choice but that was for her to decide.   I agreed with her Grandma Tee ,but we can't chose for others.  Everything that looks good is not necessary  good for you.  But in the end that's who she chose and she had so much love for him.  This was a great story on friendship, and family love as well.  I also enjoyed the story of the other characters .  Especially Britany and Maurice. I was so proud of the love they shared.  This is certainly a story not to be missed if your heart can take it.  All does not end well in love some time. I guess it is better to love and lose than to never love at all.   I was so sorry it end the way it did for Sandy . :-(	2001-07-08

Why put him thru the pain and heartache he endured . Those six days  remembering the pain he endured in January where days I just could not understand. I keep thinking do not let her do that to you .  To have that much love for a woman that did not love him . The message was so plain and clear even I knew it . I know sometmes we can not help who we fall in love with but we do not have to let them treat us any old way . I was so proud of Della for going on with her life even though she loved William . I kept wonder why William could not do the same in his past relationship with  Andrea. Then when he found some one that loved him so much why couldn't he put as much energy in his marriage with Angela as he did with Andrea .  I guess I will never understand this story but I will admit Fredrick did a great job telling it and I commend him for the courage to tell it in a way that he did . I sometimes wonder if I could feel the pain more  if Andrea had been married .  I did feel the pain when he had that conversation with him mom. I was thinking the same... don't change you will find a love.  This would be a great book for a bookclub discussion . I would love to hear others opinion on this story.
