Taylor Kinkaid is a jewel thief and Hunt St. John is a T-FLAC agent hot on her trail because she stole disks  from a terrorist that contain information that could lead to a terrible disaster.<br /><br />I thought this was a fantastic story, nonstop action and a wonderful romance.

I haven't read Maggie Shane before but I will definitely be looking for more books by her after this story.<br /><br />The Incredible Misadventures of Boo and the Boy Blunder by MaryJanice Davidson was another great story.  It's set loosely in her \\"Undead and Unwed\\" universe and is a wonderfully original story and laugh out loud funny as well. Loved the Boy Blunder!<br /><br />Warfem by Angela Knight is a steamy, fantastic story set in a time of genetically engineered warriors.  I love Baird and Alina is a wonderful, kick ass heroine, and Galar is terrific!  A sweet as well as sexy story.<br /><br />Painkillers by Jacey Ford is about a supermodel/ spy on assignment on a tropical island.<br /><br />This is an excellent anthology.

The trouble from the vamps as well as the sparks between Lyr and Diana fly.<br /><br />This is another exceptional story from Angela Knight.  The story continues from Master of the Moon, although if you haven't &lt;yet;> read that, this works as a stand-alone book too.<br /><br />Diana is a wonderful strong heroine and Lyr is a strong, sexy, wonderful hero.

I wouldn't have thought it would work, but it does and it's a terrific story. What I really love about Suzanne's books is how she weaves such strong stories for her secondary characters and this novel is no exception.  Jule's Cassidy has a romance, or two &lt;g> which was a wonderful addition to the story.  The dedication alone brought me to tears.  I can't wait until Max and Gina's story comes out.

Eve ends up taking Nixie into protective custody at her home.  It was a very touching storyline with Eve and Roarke bonding with a child and exploring and healing some of their own childhood issues.<br /><br />I do agree with some of the other reviewers that the bad guys were very shadowy and the story had an abrupt ending...I felt like I wasn't sure exactly what happened and would have liked to know more.	2005-02-11

I really enjoyed all the stories.<br /><br /> The Girl Who was Infatuated with Death by Laurell K Hamilton is a short story (too short!) set in the time period between Blue Moon and Obsidian Butterfly when Anita was taking a break from 'the boys' :-)  It's an interlude between her and Jean-Claude as she's working to save a young girl from becoming a vampire.  I really enjoyed this story.  It fits very well between the two books and it was wonderful to have a new LKH story in an anthology, as previous ones have been excerpts from her other books.<br /><br />One Word Answer by Charlaine Harris: I've only read the first book in her Sookie Stackhouse series (and loved it), now I'm going to read the ones I've missed. Sookie receives an inheritance from her cousin and helps to solve the mystery of her death. It was funny, also a bit on the short side and featured Sookie's friend Bubba who is actually Elvis and very funny.<br /><br />Biting in Plain Sight by MaryJanice Davidson is connected to her Undead and Unwed series.  I really enjoyed this story of a small town Veterinarian, who is also a vampire and a man from her town who has finally decided to take matters into his own hands and tell her he loves.  They are trying to stop a vampire serial killer with the help of Betsy and Eric from Undead and Unwed.  Touching and funny too.<br /><br />Galahad by Angela Knight was excellent. It's a story in Angela's wonderful series that joins Arthurian legend with vampire lore.  Caroline is a former English teacher who has only recently become a Magea (a witch) and was heartbroken by the vampire who turned her.  Then she has a vision about someone making evil vamps and her and a handsome vamp getting rid of them, and she goes in search of the good guy vamp who turns out to be Galahad.  It's another wonderful, yet stand alone, story in Ms. Knights incredible new series, funny and very steamy.<br /><br />Blood Lust by Vickie Taylor: Daniel is a scientist who has been working to come up with an alternative to blood.  The man he works for turns on him, takes away everything and Daniel wants revenge. He meets Deadre a vampire who he wants to help him.  Together they find the bad guy and love.Lust by Vickie Taylor: Daniel is a scientist who has been working to come up with an alternative to blood.

When a member of her club who's been copying Blair is murdered, Blair is thrown back with a man from her past.<br /><br />I loved this book.  I wasn't sure if I'd like it at the beginning when I realized that it was written in first person but I ended up really enjoying it.

I thought the mystery was really well done and I really didn't know who the killer was until the end (and I'm one of those people who usually figure it out early :)<br />I also liked the theme of mothering and how that fit into more understanding of Eve and Roarke's relationships with their mothers.<br />What I most appreciated was the humor.  The book could have been especially dark because of the killer but there was enough humor sprinkled throughout that I had MANY laugh out loud moments - great story!	2004-04-12

Quite often when I read anthologies, one or two of the stories are excellent and the others just OK.  I really enjoyed all the stories in this anthology. The first two stories (by Lynsay Sands and Lisa Cach) are historical, which I don't often read, but I enjoyed them both very much. The last two (by Julie Kenner and Susan Grant) are the reason I bought this and they were both wonderful.<br />\\"Mother, May I?\\" by Lynsay Sands is set in Medieval England. The story is about Lord Jonathan, a knight, whose mother goes to some extreme and sometimes funny antics to get him to finally wed.  This was a sweet and humourous story. This is the first story I've read by this author and I liked this one so much, I will now look for more.<br />\\"The Breeding Season\\" by Lisa Cach is also a historical.  Charles and Evelina's mothers force them to spend time together. She is very flamboyant and he is very shy...at first &lt;g>  I wasn't sure at first if I would like these characters, as they did not seem to be the usual romance hero/heroine, but I did and the story was very good.<br />\\"Seeking Single Superhero\\" by Julie Kenner is set in the same world as her novel \\"Aprodite's Kiss\\" and was excellent. Jennifer works along with her mother at the Mortal-Protector Liaison Office and is NOT looking for a protector (superhero) boyfriend.  Her mother has other ideas &lt;g>.  I loved this one...it was funny, sexy and I can't wait until the release of \\"Aprodite's Passion\\" next month.  If you haven't read Aprodite's Kiss before this, you will want to after!<br />\\"The Day Her Heart Stood Still\\" by Susan Grant is also a science fiction romance and it was fabulous!  Andie is a pilot and astronaut who's mother is (much to her dismay) a UFO fanatic.  Imagine her surprise when her mother brings home a handsome and very sexy alien. It's a lovely and touching story and Susan's dedication before the story brought tears to my eyes. Excellent and highly recommended, as are all of Susan's stories!<br />An all around excellent anthology.ll around excellent anthology.	2002-03-27

Completely nonconsensual on everyone's part and dysfunctional mind games seemed to be the order of the day.<br />The characters were all extremely annoying. Paul, the Dom, was just obnoxious and I couldn't see what Claire (or anyone else for that matter) would see in him, Claire was completely self-absorbed, Tristin was pitiful and Beth was the worst excuse for a best friend I've ever read about. I didn't care what happened to any of them and only kept reading hoping for some kind of happy ending.  The ending kind of drifted off and a &quot;Thelma and Louise&quot; might have served these characters better!<br />If you want to read some great D/s fiction, I would suggest Laura Antoniou's Marketplace series, Claire Thompson's Sarah's Awakening (a romantic bdsm story) or Anastasia Day's Bodice Rippers (three excellent novellas).	2002-02-12

This is one of my favorite fantasy series but I found this book and the last one to be dissapointing. The last one &quot;Faith of the Fallen&quot; seemed to be only half a story and left a lot unfinished. I was hoping that this one would at least complete all the loose ends from the last book but it did not. It almost seemed like a veerrryyyy long short story. Richard and Kahlan did not come in until the very end and while the storyline with Jennsen and her different view of Richard and the order was somewhat interesting, it seems to me like it could have been condensed so that we could get back to the main story and tie up some of the loose ends from the last book. Personally, I am ready for a conclusion and happy ending in the next book.	2002-01-23

I loved Catherine's first 2 books (Shadowder and Sheilder) and was looking forward to this one. I am so impressed, that as much as I loved the first 2, Shamara is even better!  It was great to see Jarek get his own story, Eirene is a wonderful heroine and I loved the secondary characters, esp Lani!  I am looking forward to more in this extraordinary series!!!	2001-10-03

I mostly read contemporary and paranormal romance with only occasional historicals (Lisa Kleypas, Robin Schone, Julia Quinn) but as I've loved Emma's other books I bought this as soon as it was published and loved it!  It's a great story, very steamy and one of the best books I've read this year.	2001-09-19

I like Harlequin Temptations and the new Blaze series but some are definately better then others.  This one was exceptional!<br />Hunter St. John blackmails Gillian Cassidy to spend 30 nights with him as revenge for something her father did to Hunter many years before.  This is a very hot and steamy story with an interesting suspense story thrown in. The hero and heroine were both interesting, independant characters and I found the whole story including the interesting way they were thrown together very believable! Great job JoAnn Ross!  This is the first book I've read of yours and I will be buying more!	2001-09-18

I really liked Nina Bruhns previous SIM (catch me if you can) and bought this one on the basis of that. It's a very different story but wonderful also.  Rini Herelius is trying to recover from the break-up of a relationship that has left her feeling insecure and mistrustful of men. She deceides to go to a Powwow to get away. There she meets a handsome warrior and has a night of incredible (and steamy :) passion. The next day through her mis-understanding of what she sees, she takes off without even giving him her name. Colton Lonetree is a lawyer and Native American who was adopted and has a mistrust of women and being abandoned by them.  He searches for Rini but they had never even exchanged names. Through an act of fate he meets up with her and finds she is pregnant with their child. The book is the story of  them both learning to trust enough to love.  A wonderful story of healing, forgiveness and passion.	2001-05-16
US	52928308	R134NNDIIPYKA8	1892520567	631396884	Feather On The Wind	Books	5	7	9	N	N	A fascinating and erotic story!	I just finished this one today and I absolutely could not put it down. It was fascinating and fantastic. It combined erotic romance,  psychological study, fantasy and a bit of a  mystery. It was &quot;Make her dreams come true&quot; by Joey W. Hill. The story takes place entirely in a shopping mall (I think this has forever altered my view of malls ;) and the story that unfolds was just excellent.  It is a gentle dom/sub story with many unexpected twists and a sweet message re: unconditional love.  I found it a very emotionally powerful story. I am looking forward to reading more by this author.	2001-05-05
US	52928308	R1Z97AUNIC3F1G	0352329351	448870565	The Gift of Shame (Black Lace)	Books	5	7	8	N	N	A Great Black Lace story	I read this one in the Black Lace Omnibus, which is a collection of three stories and this one was my favorite. The story is about Helen, who is a young widow with a lot of guilt about her husbands death.  She is introduced to Jeffery by a friend of hers and together they explore Helen's most secret fantasies. The story has to do with Helen letting go of guilt and shame and finding out who she is and what she want to be. The story has a strong bondage and dominance theme and the ending has a great twist. A really good story line along with very nice erotica! This one is worth checking the auctions for!	2000-11-12

I have been studying tarot for 20 years and have read most of the books.  This is the best!  It works with any deck (I use rider-waite and medicine woman tarot).

I have loved this series and although I agree this book is not the best, overall I did like it. My main complaint is that it seems to be half a book! The part of the story regarding the chimes was finished but the rest  about jagang and the order was left unfinished. I may (or maybe not :-)  wait for the paperback next time.	1999-05-13
