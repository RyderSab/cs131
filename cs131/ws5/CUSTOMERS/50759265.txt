There are many good books on Arabic grammar, but I know none that explains the language as clearly, honestly, and pitilessly as this.  It's rough going and tough to use, but only because Arabic itself is an awfully difficult language.  Other books that try to ease readers into the language through simplifications and inexact descriptions ultimate do the readers a disservice.  If you want to learn to read classical texts, get this one.	2004-04-13

At the time, Afghanistan was a rite that the hardest of the hardcore journalists had to go through, and of those who survived to write a book about the experience, Kaplan's is one of the best.  His experience scrambling around the Afghan mountains with the mujahideen is not one that many people have had, and his descriptions convey well the roughness of the terrain and people of that country.  In addition, he analyzes politics astutely -- the details are sometimes moot now that everything has changed in the region, but for giving a sense of the country and its conflicted this book is superb.	2002-03-21

Memory, so long a darling subject among intellectual elites, has fallen out of favor among modern intellectuals.

He listens to these creatures, and I daresay knows them better than they know themselves.<br />My only disappointment is that there is no serious treatment of the very real philosophical issues that necessarily accompany this sort of project.  The problem of `other minds', so unresolved in even the human case, only waxes in difficulty in the face of nonhuman species, being as they are incapable of propositional speech.	2000-10-13

With his new book Rembrandt's Eyes, historian Simon Schama has added a new portrait of the artist, this one in meticulously and exhaustively  researched, rhapsodically written prose.<br />Schama's heavy tome makes every  attempt to be a definitive work on the painter, and it succeeds. First and  foremost it is a narrative of the life and work of Rembrandt van Rijn,  although calling it a &quot;biography&quot; somehow sounds reductive. It is  equal parts analysis of Rembrandt's painting, documentation of his life,  and history of seventeenth century Holland, so sections of the book can be  read with profit by anyone studying the artist, his art, or the social  history of the times.<br />The Rembrandt of Schama's book is a complex man,  with hubris, greed and an enormous talent for portraiture. Early on he  takes the monumentally cocky step of signing only his first name -- no  &quot;van Rijn&quot; -- as if he knew his paintings would be studied for  centuries to come. His understanding of humans and their personae was  without parallel, Schama writes. &quot;No painter would ever understand the  theatricality of social life as well as Rembrandt. He saw the actors in men  and the men in actors.&quot;<br />As his title suggests, Schama finds special  messages in the eyes of Rembrandt's subjects. He notes that in art  education painters were taught to put special care into their depiction of  the whites of eyes, yet in many of Rembrandt's works -- Schama points to  &quot;The Artist in his Studio&quot; (1629) -- the eyes are dull, dark  pits. &quot;When Rembrandt made eyes,&quot; Schama says, &quot;he did so  purposefully,&quot; and so in Rembrandt's Eyes he continually returns to  the haunting eyes the painter painted.<br />Most of all, Schama's book is a  meditative, entranced attempt to get behind the faces we see in Rembrandt's  self-portraits. Schama reads Rembrandt's self-portraits in variouscostumes  -- as a merchant, as a soldier, for example -- as indications of his  elusiveness, as if each portrait were meant to conceal rather than reveal  its subject. In analysis of one self-portrait, Schama writes that the  painter &quot;has disappeared inside his persona,&quot; inscrutable beyond  the dead dark eyes of the painting. The artist's disguise hides his true  self, and the critic is left to speculate. It seems that in this case  Schama is grasping (as art historians must) at facts and attitudes that can  never be certainly known, constructing and imputing elaborate guesses that  fail precisely because the painter has succeeded.<br />Schama's reverence for  Rembrandt and art in general winds up being both a virtue and a vice. The  book begins with an epigraph from Paul Valery: &quot;We should apologize  for daring to speak about painting.&quot; It is difficult to imagine a  guide through this world who is more well-versed and in love with his  subject.  But do we really want our biographers to be respectful to the  point of silence? Nobody wants to learn about the masters from a guide who  finds them too sublime to defile with comment. Granted, a hefty book like  this is hardly &quot;silence,&quot; but Schama's hushed tones do get  distracting.<br />This book has the virtue of being as close to exhaustive  about its subject as one could hope. There is little psychological  interpretation that Schama leaves undone, and little consequential  biographical detail that he leaves unmentioned. Rembrandt's Eyes, a mammoth  book that takes on with grace the equally mammoth task of explaining what  is behind the brooding eyes of Rembrandt's portraits, will be a definitive  work on the painter and his work.	2000-01-14

For a third person account of  Gould's life, I recommend Otto Friedrich's biography.  For an account of  his music, try Payzant's book _Glenn Gould, Music and Mind_.	1999-12-25

This book's light-hearted, creative presentation makes it one of the best McLuhan works to read if you want to get to know the sorts of  questions he was asking.  REaders of this picture book will be treated to  unconventional typography, generous and amusing excerpts from Joyce and  others, and extended meditations on the nature of the new media and their  relation to the old.  McLuhan's understanding of the way technology affects  us is lucid and insightful, moreso than the vast majority of the  cyber-commentators out there today.	1999-12-25

It gives ample information about the Greens' early lives, and it has useful  appendices detailing the many donations and endowments these remarkable  people left behind at MIT, the Colorado School of Mines, Austin College,  UBC and so many other places.<br />This probably of limited interest to an  audience not already acquainted with the Greens and their philanthropy.

The characters in this book, while touchingly in  love, have not the realist punch necessary to keep this book going.  MOre  importantly, if we are to analyze this book from a socially aware  perspective, it seems that the social interactions are poisoned by a  ``butch-femme'' conflation of expression and orientation.  There currently  no shortage of far, far better novels out there, both lesbian and not.	1999-12-24

Instead, we have dummies inflated with rhetoric and ideas.  I would hate to be in the room with one  of these people for more than a few minutes -- some would bore me to tears,  others would make me get violent.  The plot of this novel is pretty weak,  too.<br />Rand's philosophy is very easy to understand, and as a consequence  this ``philosophical novel'' is very easy to read.  For readers ready for  novels with human *and* philosophical content (and better philosophical  content at that), I advise reading Iris Murdoch.	1999-12-24

Eliot had a lively correspondence with so many, including family, friends, editors, and partners in verse.  Even  the short letters -- like the ones in which Eliot simply announces to his  correspondent that he's exhausted and doesn't want to write anything --  give a glimpse of how Old Possum acted.<br />Eliot's poetry is so cerebral and  allusive that when reading it, one can feel at his mercy.  In his letters  he is far less in control, and the contrast is fascinating.	1999-12-24

The stories in this collection are about characters' search to find ways to deal with what was happening in the war,  both during and after the horrors of combat.  The characters try to  reconcile their sometimes atrocious acts in war with their kinder selves in  the real world: they try to explain to themselves how they can kill a man  in battle, yet have jobs and hobbies and lovers at home.<br />Veterans of the  war have told me that this book more than any other raised the questions  that they themselves faced.  It gives few answers, but it is a wonderful  and beautiful contribution to literature.	1999-12-08

Dubbed a ``failed prodigy'' by the  popular press, he lived out his years as an eccentric and a  recluse.<br />Wallace's book, the only biography of this most enigmatic of  prodigies, gives us a balanced look at Sidis' up-bringing and a somewhat  revisionist look at his later life.  Sidis apparently was hard at work on  manuscripts of various sorts even during his later years; this book is to  my knowledge the only one that gives an account of that later work, which  dealt with American Indians.<br />There is no better source of information on  Sidis and his tortured life.  This biography is not an authoritative  academic biography, and it does not claim to be.  Rather, it is a  fascinating popular account of an amazing and dramatic life.	1999-12-06

He names 99 novels, from Joyce to Mailer, that he claims exemplify the best in the English language since 1939.  Some of the  selections are predictable (Finnegans Wake, Gravity's Rainbow), others may  raise eyebrows (Goldfinger, Giles Goat Boy).<br />Like all lists, Burgess'  makes you wonder why one book is included while another is not.  This is  generally not a fruitful way of judging these works.  Rather, the fault in  Burgess' list is that his reviews of each book (usually less than a page  each) are too brief to be of much value.  In this volume we get to hear  only the faintest murmur of what I'm sure was a great din of opinions on  this outspoken writer's mind.	1999-12-05

Nevertheless, what you'll find between the covers of this volume will haunt  you: it is about hubris, fate, death and tragedy.  Maclean seems to feel so  acutely the fear in the men's eyes as they burned to death.  Making sense  of this tragedy becomes a miniature study of the meaning of life and the  meaning of death.  The project must have been especially poignant given  Maclean's own failing health as he tried to finish this work.  Even in its  rough form, this book is a masterpiece.	1999-12-04

The result is a fine, fine book that tells us more about the  candidates and more about the politics of 1972 than any other  available.<br />Probably as a result of substance abuse, Thompson seems  incapable of writing in any but the most charged and manic way, which is a  refreshing change from the egghead drear that characterizes so much bad  political writing.	1999-12-04

They are recognizable  to long-time rowers and comprehensible to those who have never rowed  before.

Everything from her characters to her narrative to her unconventional (but effective) typography are superb and praiseworthy.   It upset me, however, that toward the end of the book things take a  supernatural turn--I don't mind a book that bends the rules of physical and  psychic interaction, but it really must bend the rules from the very  beginning, before those rules are really established.  I felt that by  intoducing that element so late, it betrayed some of the excellent  emotional truth of the book's beginning.  Nonetheless, _The Bone People_ is  a fine read, and I hope we see more books that match the competence its  author displays in the beginning.	1999-12-03

Allie, the practical yet passionate father, leads his family into the jungles on a mad  quest: he wants to strike out on his own, survive by his ingenuity. and  leave behind the mindless consumerism of mainstream life.<br />I thought all  these things were virtues before I picked up this book.  What Theroux shows  is that there is a human cost to genius--Allie's quest to perfect his work  leads him to destroy everyone and everything around him.

The lasting value of it, though, is the abundance of anecdotal evidence that  provides a look at some of the occasionally distasteful results of  affirmative action.  None of these taken individually, nor all of them  collectively, are any compelling argument against affirmative action, but  they do provide something that a.a.'s defenders must respond to.  If, as  D'Souza contends, our standards are slipping greatly as a result of  multiculturalism,  multiculturalists will have to tell us why their project  offsets those losses.  Some of the vignettes from modern academe are quite  unsettling indeed, and no matter where we fall on the political spectrum,  being unsettled will do us some good.	1999-12-03

Dowling tells the story of mind, all the way from the molecular level to higher-order brain functions.  Throughout the book he is  clear and exact in his prose.  Dowling makes a daunting field sound  comprehensible; after reading this primer I want to read Dowling's more  technical _Neurons and Networks: An Introduction to Neuroscience_.	1999-12-03

Later he describes travels  to various exotic locations.  Some of the accounts are illuminating; others  are no deeper than a travel guide.  The last sections are devoted to  Crichton's supposed experimentation with the paranormal, i.e., bending  spoons and seeing auras and the like.<br />Crichton strains credibility with  his descriptions of these hokey ESP things, but in general his writing is  engaging.  Even the hokey sections have a spookiness to them that I must  admit I enjoyed quite a lot.  Better travel writing can be found elsewhere,  but it is interesting to hear the familiar Crichton narrative voice  focusing his lens inward in these pages.	1999-12-03

Buy _Learned Pigs and Fireproof Women_ if you want amazing stories, incredible histories, unbelievable accounts of some of the best acts of the last few centuries.  <br />If I didn't know Ricky  Jay's fine reputation as a magic historian, I'd think this book was a joke.   The people and acts described are too outlandish, too impressive to be  true.  But I trust Jay to strike awe into me, and he does so repeatedly and  without fail in this book.<br />The book's illustrations and photographs are  marvelous supplements to Jay's smoothly written histories of  performers--memory artists, dwarf magicians without arms or legs, women who  walk into ovens.  This is the quintessential introduction to this bizarre  world.	1999-12-03

Carpenter provides a literate and extremely detailed account of every  period of Pound's long life, from his  Idaho beginnings to his POW cage in Pisa to his shadowy senility in Venice.   It's too bad this book is out of print, because I think it provides one of  the best and most well-written portraits of Pound and the numerous friends  and colleagues who derived benefit from his editing and patronage.   Carpenter also provides balanced but critical discussion of Pound's  unfortunate political leanings and their relation to his art.  With some  very good photos.	1999-12-03

If you take a heart, a liver, two kidneys, two corneas, and bone marrow from a willing  donor with a known execution date, and you can save quite a few lives with  his death.<br />It's common-sense arguments like these, not grisly  death-obsession, that makes this book worth reading.  I expect that some  readers will find the sections on euthanasia distasteful, but the subject  is handled carefully and smartly.  <br />For all his faults, Kevorkian is a  strong and articulate voice who is too often written off automatically as a  crank and a murderer.

He seems to write as if every sentence had to be the punchline and keystone sentence of the entire chapter.<br />The attempts are nearly always  successful, and the supercharged style is seriously addictive.  Know what  you're getting into, though: this is not a book that lets your mind sit  back and relax.  There is no human drama, nor any emotional complexity.   There is SO much happening in every sentence, and Leyner demands your  humour-sense's undivided attention.  Bed-time reading it's not.	1999-11-30

I say the best way to travel is without a guidebook (most of these places can be negotiated with maps alone), but if you're going to get one...<br />The information that's in this book is pretty good, but there's not much of it. The layout looks good, but it isn't done with the visual economy of Lonely Planet guides, which have more information and are easier to read. (The LP guide is also easier to carry around, which is important for a SE Asia guide.)<br />The Cambodia section in this guide is remarkably sparse.<br />In short: get Lonely Planet's version, or don't get one at all.

Maybe I went into this book expecting too much, but I finished the book utterly unimpressed with what it had to say.  It boils down to a  series of very discrete strategies for living one's life in a loving and  satisfying way.  I can't really ``disagree'' with it--yeah sure, ok, love  is good, uh-huh--but that doesn't stop me from wishing Merton were a lot  more explicit and rigorous in his prescriptions.  As it stands, I don't  know how anyone could possibly profit from reading this touchy-feely  manifesto.	1999-11-28

I can hardly say anything bad about this book, except that the author must have been at least a little nuts to write it.  The passion and honesty with which he writes about his own (self-diagnosed) shortcomings,  as well as his obsessive attempts to remedy them, are pleasantly eerie.  In  an age when physical valour counts for little, and in a  discipline--literature--where so many practicioners despise the cultivation  one's own flesh, this book is an original.

The answer: a very playful, very  thoughtful one.  The essays and reviews here are not always very deep  (sometimes they sound more like book reports than like reviews), but they  always have a freshness and stylistic beauty that is enviable to say the  least.  There is a wonderful sense of humour at work here.  Even the essays  I disagree with I revisit now and then out of admiration for Rushdie's  writing.<br />That said, there are some pieces in here whose contents equal or  surpass their forms.  The Carver obit is sad and fitting, and the more  personal essays are poignant insights into the author's condition.	1999-11-28

It is part a social history, part a theoretical deflation of the idea that intelligence can be measured with a  single fixed number.  Both parts are very interesting and can be read with  profit by historians, lay readers, and people on both sides of the IQ  debate.  Even if Gould is no psychologist, psychologists must answer his  arguments, which compel by dint of common sense.<br />I'm surprised no one has  mentioned how very literate and artfully written this book is.  Readers of  Gould's essays will not be surprised by this, but if you're expecting to  pick up a dry technical tome with unfathomable jargon, you'll be pleasantly  surprised.  Gould has written a great book without ``dumbing it down.''	1999-11-28

Personal differences aside, I found Wilson's ability to survey human knowledge in a clear and  accurate way to be reason enough to read _Consilience_.  There are a lot of  arguments and data in here, all of which are well laid-out and deserve a  lengthy response.<br />On the other hand, I really do find it disingenous of  Wilson to say that he want a ``unity of knowledge'' when he's really hoping  for the non-scientists to just surrender outright.  The unity he seeks  amount to an admission on humanists' part that their disciplines are weak  and explain less than the neuroscientists and sociobiologists.  This may be  the case, but if it is, then it sounds more like a mass defection than a  peaceful and interdependent coexistence.	1999-11-28

McCaffery has chosen a good selection of postmodern SF, but the excerpts are too often just a couple pages long.  The result is a book a mile wide  and an inch deep: it touches on every aspect of postmodern SF without  really explaining or clearing up anything at all.<br />A good way to use this  book might be to read through it, choose what strikes your fancy, then buy  the complete books attached to those.  But I'm afraid if you just read this  book, your glimpses of this very exciting genre will be too fleeting for  you to get a good picture of it as a whole.<br />To his credit, McCaffery has  chosen an excellent array of writers and subgenres, including many who I  did not know were SF or who dealt with SF in ways I hadn't expected.  I  should also mention that the design of the book is fantastic.	1999-11-28

In this book, he is completely frank about what the state of poetry was when he wrote, and what literature of the past is worth reading.  His bluntness is refreshing beyond belief, esp. compared  to the sorts of obfuscation one finds in critics today who try to tell us  what they like to read.<br />There are some startling opinions in here, but I  highly recommend giving Pound his due.  He is in love with literature as an  art, as a profession, as a process, and as a way of life, and this book is  a beautiful introduction to his passions.  For me, he still sets the  standard for clarity and candour in writing about literature.	1999-11-28

Buss is a clear writer and does a fine job of explaining a theory of sexuality based on evolutionary  psychology, but I don't think his conclusions are that new, or even that  shocking.  The bulk of what he says can be restated (without the supporting  data) in a much slimmer book.  I recommend The Evolution of Desire to  anyone who hasn't heard basic arguments about evolutionary psychology  before.  But if you've done any reading at all about evolutionary biology,  this is probably not a terribly revealing read.	1999-11-28

From his language to his structure to his unfailingly adept choice of detail, he is a master.<br />My one caveat is that  _The Devil Problem_ doesn't always succeed in *making* the subject  interesting, at least not in the cases of the most public figures.  You  need to go into the Reggie Jackson profile with a basic interest in Reggie  Jackson.  But Remnick's profiles are all comprehensive and eviably  well-written.

It carries plenty of information packaged in well-organized sections, which makes it great for leisure reading.<br />I've read it several times over the last year  and remain impressed with the humanity and cheer with which he writes.  In  many ways his friendly, live-with-the-locals style of travel is a perfect  antidote to the Lonely Planet syndrome, which has travelers bunking with  other backpackers at guesthouses and haggling every last shekel out of the  most kindly third-world merchants.<br />I've been to a couple of these places  and found the dangers overstated in the book, but that may be a function of  the book's age.<br />Unfortunately, it appears that some sections of the book  are very poorly edited, and by now, the third edition is long out of date.   I would never use it as my sole source of information on a place, but it's  a wonderful way to get a quick idea of what's happening where, and what you  might have to do if you're unlucky enough to find yourself there.	1999-11-28

It is laced with allusions taken from everyone from Halberstam to  Heraclitus; in general it comes across as grecophilic lament at the  newfangled tendencies to teach to the lowest common denominator.<br />I dare  not argue with Hicks, for his knowledge of the philosophy of education  surely trumps my own.  But from a practical side, I do find fault in the  program of study that he implies through most of the book and makes  partially explicit toward the end.  Unfortunately, only a very few young  minds could withstand the pressures that Hicks advocates we place on them.   If he hopes to educate the few, then those few will be very well served by  his agenda.<br />I am heartily in favour of educating the few and pushing even  the best beyond their limites, but I suspect a general implementation of  Hicks' theories would be disasterous.  This may be a weakness of our age,  but I think it's probably just a weakness of Hicks' book.	1999-11-28

Nozick's book has a tendency toward sentimentality, but I do think he is to be applauded for trying to take on these issues.

I suppose the price you  pay for writing about human issues like these is a sacrifice of rigour and  an unfortunate tendency to sound like a self-help book.<br />Nevertheless, the  book is worth reading, if only because it reminds us where philosophy comes  from and why we think in the first place.  I disagreed with Nozick often  and consider some of the chapters puff pieces, but I must admit that it's  been a long time since I read a contemporary philosophical work that made  me consider changing the way I think and act.	1999-11-25
