Neil Smith and his novels with a pro-liberty theme, but this book was a disappointment.  <br /> <br />The basic theme is a history professor at a small college becomes the Libertarian Party candidate for president after being drafted by his students.  Through a freak set of circumstances, he winds up becoming President.  He then proceeds to turn the establishment upside down by using his powers as President to eliminate many government programs and laws that he believes to be unconstitutional and against a libertarian view of the Bill of Rights.   <br /> <br />What I found disappointing about all this is the breezy way things were done, mostly by executive order.  In many instances, it's just not believable as the President doesn't have that kind of power, or would certainly be impeached for trying to use it that way.   <br /> <br />An example, about half way through his first term, he gets on television and announces that Social Security is bankrupt and therefore he is ending it. Any claims for payouts that citizens are due may be deducted from future income taxes due.  That's it!  OK, first, I don't think the President alone has the power to do this, especially as Congress set up SS and surely had budgeted the money.  Secondly, I'm sure that the millions of seniors who depend on SS as their primary source of income will be greatly comforted by the knowledge that they do not have to pay income taxes in the future, as they wheel their shopping cart from the soup kitchen back to their cardboard box home in the alley next door.   <br /> <br />There are many instances of situations similar to the above.  Don't get me wrong.  I love the idea of reducing government and getting rid of programs and institutions that are not specifically called for in the Constitution, but there's a path of how you go from here to there, to honor commitments made to millions who depend on them.  For instance, he could have announced that the Federal government will begin selling off land and assets to to pay off those seniors as he dismantles SS.   <br /> <br />At some point in the book you realize that this isn't fiction, it's poorly a thought out fantasy.  I would have liked to have seen the authors write a book promoting liberty and less government, but in a much more realistic manner.  I wanted to leave the book thinking \\"What if...?\\"  Instead I left the book thinking \\"Bull....\\"	2005-08-23

Since she was a native of Germany, she had several dishes that I now found myself missing.  I also realized that I was too stupid when I was growing up to ask her how to cook.  As a result, I could seldom find German restaurant food as tasty as hers.<br /><br />Well, I searched around a bit online and in the library and the \\"authentic\\" German cookbooks I found didn't represent the kind of cooking my Mom had done, until I found this book. As soon as I saw the sample recipe for Jaeger Schnitzel, and prepaped it, I knew I was in business.<br /><br />This book has some tasty recipes in it.  I recommend it if you are missing your German mother's cooking too.	2005-04-03

Greg Easterbrook informs readers that our perceptions of life today are wrong.  By every objective measure such as life span, overall health, income levels, housing, luxuries, leisure time, etc., life is better today than it ever has been.  So why aren't we happier than ever?<br />The first few chapters explain how life is better than ever, which left me feeling quite inspired and grateful to have been born now vs. in the past.  No matter how much we romanticize the past, life is just better today!  <br />Small personal note here, I think that I may disagree with him a little bit.  I believe my parent's generation did do a little better than us.  Almost everyone my age were kids when their parents were my age, and we remember our houses when we were kids being bigger, and generally having better vacations, cars, etc., then we can afford now that we are that age.  But that may be peculiar to just my social circle.<br />The following chapters discusses new problems brought about by improved living conditions, such as traffic, noise, feeling rushed, too many choices to make, etc.  All are better to deal with than the old problems that had existed before.  They also deal with why people, who are living better than 99% of the people who have ever existed, aren't happier than they are.  Lack of spirituality, lots of spare time to be depressed, and a constant barrage of negative news seem to be the answer.  This is one of the reasons I find it difficult to watch the news any more.  It's 24 hours a day of terrorism, war, crime, death, global warming, and predictions of bad things that will come.<br />The last couple of chapters is where Mr. Easterbrook misses the mark.  He points out we still have serious problems like lack of universal health care and poverty.  He is alluding that government should step in and solve these problems, not realizing he is contradicting almost everything prior in the book.  Our lives have improved largely due to freedom and the marketplace allowing us to create and grow richer.  Why does he believe gov't is the solution to these other problems? Why not turn the marketplace loose on these problems instead so people can find ways to enrich themselves by helping others?  <br />I also believe he doesn't explain what poverty is in the US today. If your family of four lives in a two bedroom apartment, with power, heat, tv and no one starving, does that sound like being poor?  Well, that's how many poor families in the US live today.  That lifestyle would be considered well off in much of the rest undeveloped world, and living very well considering the lives of people of generations past.  <br />Overall, I enjoyed the book and have become more appreciative of just how lucky we are today.	2004-06-25

I'm a big fan of Clark Howard and his other books and radio show. They contain oodles of great money saving info.  Clark's radio show and books have saved me well over $900 this year with useful info I did not know about.  However, this book was a letdown.<br />Most everything in this book was common knowledge or common sense.  Example:  Want cheap clothes, then buy them from a thrift store or discount store like TJ Maxx.  Want cheap books, borrow them from the library, or buy them used on the internet.  Too often the answer is buy used, or buy at a warehouse club.<br />I can't recommend this book unless you are a novice at saving money.  You are better off saving your money and buying Clark's far superior book, &quot;Get Clark Smart: The Ultimate Guide to Getting Rich in America&quot;, which despite its title is not a get rich quick book. That book has all sorts of useful and less known money saving ideas, and a lot of information on how to avoid getting ripped off.	2004-02-18

It's somewhat mis-titled.  It's not really a get rich book.  It's more of a be careful and wise with your money.  <br />This book covers things like car buying and leasing advice, how not to be taken and get a good deal, investing basics, insurance, home buying and renting, travel advice, Time-Shares, Health Clubs, etc.<br />Clark Howard is personally responsible for saving me $900 through this book and his radio show, all by doing simple stuff.  I heard on his show about the Retirement Savings tax credit that I had failed to take in 2002 and probably would have missed this year.  I will make sure to claim it this year and file an amended return last year.  That was $400 saved.  In the book, he also gave me a source (Costco) to shop for auto insurance that will save me $500 a year for slightly better coverage than I have now.  I have checked around at many other companys and never found an offer nearly as good.<br />The writing is casual, fun, and full of anecdotes of how either Clark or his listeners have used his advice to save money. There's an incredible amount of common sense advice to save and protect you from getting ripped off.  All of it is practical and easy.  Nothing goofy like only buying 10 year old cars or recycling dental floss.<br />Read the book, listen to the radio show, and start saving your hard earned money!	2004-01-18

The book is supposed to be a mystery about some terrorist attacks in a world with no government where the people are free, responsible, and prosperous.<br />What the book really is is a set of political sermons mixed in the midst of a mystery.  The mystery itself is incredibly weak.  The investigators (good guys) do little more than ask the usual suspects (federalists) if they had anything to do with it and if they might know who.  It's not until near the end of the book that a federalist turns traitor and comes to the investigators and explains everything, including who, why, when, where, and how.  Some detective work!<br />This being said, the political sermons are interesting and thought provoking.  Some elements seem contradictory.  How can someone be sued for violating your rights if there is no law being broken?  Who will enforce the judgements if initiation of force is not allowed?  How can someone protect their trademarks, patents, or intellectual property if there are no trademark or patent law?<br />Still, the author's dream of a society built on freedom, individual rights, and minimal gov't is enticing and that makes this book worthwhile reading.  Do yourself a favor and read the first and superior book \\"The Probability Broach\\".	2003-01-10
US	52898387	R1B945JV4EWFHX	0140286780	201332264	Your Money or Your Life: Transforming Your Relationship with Money and Achieving Financial Independence	Books	4	21	22	N	N	Great concept, but exercises are tedious.	This book presents a very important concept.  It helps you think of just how valuable your time is.  When most people think they make $XX per hour, they are fooling themselves.  <br />First, think about your net salary (after taxes and deductions), then subtract all expenses necessary to go to work such as gas, car payments, insurance, appropriate clothing, cell phone, etc.  This is your true net salary.  Then add to your hours worked, all the time you spend commuting, preparing for work, shopping for work, and any other work preparation time.  Divide the total hours of work and preparing for work, into the net salary minus all those expenses, and that is your true rate of how much you make.<br />For me, that figure was depressingly low.  Now use that information to see just how much of your life you lose to buy that DVD player, 2nd car, etc.  THAT IS THE TRUE VALUE OF THOSE ITEMS.  By doing these steps, you will find it much easier to live simply.  You will find yourself asking questions like \\"Is it worth 25 hours a month of working to buy that 2nd car and pay for the extra insurance, gas, etc.?\\" <br />The book also talks about minimizing unnecessary expenses, building up your nest egg, and then being able to retire early.  The book also plenty of exercises for the reader to do.<br />I found that basic concept and initial exercises about determining the true value of things to be very useful.  All the other exercises discussed later in the book did not hold much value for me, but the initial concept is worth the 4 stars I give this book.	2003-01-01

Students Who Took Vegas for Millions	Books	4	5	5	N	N	Reads like a spy novel	This book is about an MIT graduate's adventures in a blackjack team where he learns how to count cards and win big bucks against the casinos.  <br />The first 70 or so pages cover Kevin's introduction to blackjack and the team concept, and his training.  After that the book really takes off and describes highlights of his experiences over the next 4 years.  It covers the good times and bad, the play, the parties, the barrings, the team discord, and the danger.<br />Alot of the book strongly reminded me of Ken Uston's adventures back in the late 70's and early 80's.  This book implies the team concept was new to them, but it's all been done before.  <br />If you have bought other blackjack books and are interested in blackjack, you will definitely enjoy Kevin's adventures.  Be warned, this book does not cover anything about how to count cards and does not introduce any systems.	2002-12-15

Before this book, only a very few people knew about card counting, and most only had primitive systems.  Thorp analyzed the game, ran computer simulations, and devised two effective strategies for beating the casinos at their own games.<br />Can you run out and use these systems today against the casinos?  Sure, but over 30 years have gone by and there are now simpler more effective systems.  But if you are naturally gifted at doing complex calculations in your head quickly, I think the 10 count system would still be wickedly effective.<br />Buy it for the theory and the stories.  Then go out and buy a newer book with simpler more modern counting systems.	2002-11-23

It is a book about the stories he had after going up against the casinos.<br />He had a wild ride and discusses the never ending battle between his teams and the casinos.

Another essays discusses GM's rise to compete with Ford and overtake them by not being rigid.  There is an essay that discusses how people devote themselves to the business.  Another essay discusses the abuses that resulted as Safeway was bought in a Leveraged Buy out. Another discusses racism in business.

Its not that the writing or characters were bad.  Quite the contrary, I enjoyed much of the story.  What left a sour taste in my mouth was the obvious contradiction of the Chronoliths.  <br />Chronoliths appear from the future altering our present to lead to a situation that generates the Chronoliths in the future?  I don't buy it.  Just take a moment and think it through logically.  If you are satisified with your present status, do you do something to alter the past? No.  If you are not satisfied with your present, then you do something to alter the past, so your present existence will change.  You can't alter the past dramatically to keep the same present existence.  It's not a paradox, it's nonsense.  That's why this book gets only 2 stars.	2001-12-14

Take that money and time and compare it with how much you make.  After that and taxes you will find you really make far less an hour than you thought.  <br />How much fulfillment will you gain by buying some thing vs. how much time and effort does it take to earn it?  Now use this knowledge and think about how you spend your money.  This is a powerful concept.  I've been realizing I spend far too much on the newest gadget considering how much time I have to work for it.  <br />This book also has me rethinking my need for a second car.  After you add in all the expenses of a car, is having that second car really worth the 25 hours a month I work to afford it?  Sure its convenient, but is it worth it.  Wouldn't I rather have some extra time off every month?  Or maybe some extra cash to spend on other things that will bring me more pleasure?<br />The philosophy and examples given in this book are well worth the price.

In this review I want to point out what I believe are some irritating  things in this book<br />1.  Why is everybody out to kill the time travelers?   From the first moment they set foot in the past, it seems like the sole  purpose of everyone in that time is to kill them.<br />2.  The CEO was not  really a villian, just amoral.  Yet at the end he receives an incredibly  brutal punishment for his actions by the supposedly good guys.  And his  actions weren't all that bad.<br />3.  The business plan laid out for the  company controlling the quantum time travel is a joke!  They could never  recover the billions invested and re-construction costs of historical sites  from tourism.  <br />It's these kinds of things that keep me from giving 5  stars to this book.  Still, it is a good story and I am glad I bought this  book.	2000-08-19

I thought it was a good story about a fallen angel, a group not written much about outside of religious texts.  It also provides an interesting explaination as to how vampires are created.	2000-07-17
US	52898387	R32BHYVIQMC5ZT	0316769487	862964341	The Catcher in the Rye	Books	3	3	8	N	N	A classic?  Maybe.  A good story?  Not really.	Maybe this novel is supposed to speak to the rebellious teen who can't find their path in this world.  As a middle aged adult who read this book for this first time, I was disappointed in this &quot;classic.&quot;<br />A  dumb kid with too high of an opinion of himself who thinks everyone else  are jerks gets thrown out of prep school.  He wanders around in New York  City a few days getting into various mischief until the money his mommy and  daddy sent him runs out. Then he goes home. <br />The book should have ended  with his father giving him a swift kick in the rear and throwing him out on  the street to appreciate what real life is like and to take advantage of  his opportunities.	2000-07-03

This book comes darn close.<br />The MaranGraphics instruction books for computer applications and education are  generally superb for learning how to do something on a computer from  scratch.  This book will teach you how to program HTML and put up a very  nice web site of your own.<br />My one gripe is that I would have liked to  have worked on one project from the beginning, starting from blank page to  finished web site, while seeing how each stage looks via the excellent  graphics these books have.  That was not the case.  This book showed you  the code, and what it's effect would be, but the pages were always  different.  Not something I could do and have it show just like in the  book.  Some of the other Maran Graphics books do just that.<br />Still, you  won't go wrong if you pick this book to learn HTML.  It is not the complete  end all reference to HTML, but if you get that advanced you can buy one of  those too.	2000-05-13

This novel is a philosophy book about the author's narcissistic  anti-Victorian views and clever witticisms.  Oh yeah, somewhere in there is  a story about a man who makes a wish that his portrait would show his  physical age and experiences, while he remains forever young and handsome.  The wish comes true.<br />There was incredible potential for this story that  wasn't lived up too. I think this novel really needed a heavy-handed editor  to make it great.	2000-05-10

Patricia Anthony is best known as a Science Fiction author, but this is not a science fiction book. It is a book about a young American who joined the British army in WWI while looking for adventure.<br />The book is a series  of letters written to his younger brother describing his experiences and  encounters during the trench warfare.  If you like books based on Word War  I, you will enjoy this book.	2000-03-18

I went into this book thinking about how Ernest Hemingway is supposed to be one of the greatest writers who ever lived and set in a time period I love to read about.  A Farewell to Arms was a disappointment.<br />It wasn't  all that bad, but in no way, shape or form does it reach the level of one  of the all time greats!  I could never get any kind of handle on Catherine.  Who was she besides some sort of mindless automaton?<br />I think what  disappointed me the most is that the story of two emotionally wounded  desperate people enduring and then escaping the horror of WWI has so much  potential, but that potential is never fully realized.	2000-02-12

An enjoyable mystery set in an alternative timeline where the Cuban Missile Crisis got out of hand.  Nuclear war breaks out and the USSR takes out 4 major cities plus some military bases.  The US wipes out the USSR.   <br />It is now 10 years later and the US is beginning to come out of its  economic crisis when a reporter is pulled off a routine murder case of an  old veteran due to national security.  The old vet had some secret papers  and the reporter wants to know what it's all about.	2000-01-15

In this book about an alternate timeline where the US and Confederacy choose opposite sides during the Great War, everybody has a story to tell, and Turtledove spends the entire book doing just that.  It's impossible to  remember who the characters are because there are so many of them and the  story switches to a different character's point of view after every couple  of pages.  It would have been far superior to limit this book to 3 seperate  character's stories.  Then the reader would be able to relate to the  character and follow their stories easier.<br />This book was really a  dissapointment considering it contains two of my favorite subjects,  alternate timelines and WWI.	1999-12-27

This book is an excellent guide to help beginners learn Excel 97.  This book was used in my Excel Class.  It shows you (with tons of pictures) step by step how to use all the basic features of Excel, and some of the  advanced features as well.  <br />Another reviewer had it right.  Another few  exercises and I would have been totally satisifed.	1999-12-13

A detective of the same cut as Phillip Marlowe is blasted into a parallel dimension where governments don't exist, freedom and responsibility rules, and prosperity is everywhere.  There he uncovers a plot by the dreaded  Federalists to institute a government upon the people and it's up to him  and his anarchist buddies to stop them.    Although a bit dated, I first  read this novel in the early 80's and loved it.  It was a great  introduction to libertarianism and a wild ride to boot.  One of my all time  favorites.    UPDATE:  It's 2009 and I've read this book again.  I still love it.  And the way our government and economy are going, I can see the same sort of dreary scenario the book portrays again, with government crushing the prosperity out of the USA.  Probably more relevant today then it's been since it was released.	1999-03-27

Thomas Covenant who at the end of the first trilogy had saved The Land and learned to love it, is returned to The Land a thousand years later.  The Land has been corrupted by the evil of Lord Foul and nearly all the beauty  and magic has been perverted to evil.<br />Thomas Covenant, the White Gold  Wielder, and his new companions search for a way to end the worst of the  evil, the dreaded Sunbane, and restore beauty upon The Land.  <br />Be warned  that the 2nd trilogy goes downhill starting with THE ONE TREE and never  recovers its wonder and fascination until the end in WHITE GOLD WIELDER.	1999-03-27

The main character is a self-loathing sort, and he is tasked with saving a wonderful fantasy land called &quot;The Land.&quot;  <br />The book and the trilogy are excellent.  Donaldson pulls it off despite his decision to put  such an anti-hero in the hero slot. The plot, other characters, and rich  history of The Land make this trilogy a staple of fantasy literature.  The  story continues with THE ILLEARTH STONE and THE POWER THAT PRESERVES.	1999-03-27

All the other books of the Chronicles of Thomas Covenant rate from good to excellent, except this one!  It is wandering disjointed morass of bizarre places and people.  The story switches from the main character to the  viewpoints of other characters throughout this whole book.  Thomas Covenant  is rarely heard from in this book.  He is just some body everyone else  drags around.  The whole book is pointless! Nothing of real consequence  happens until the next book WHITE GOLD WIELDER.<br />If you want to read the  whole second trilogy, do yourself a favor and make sure you get this one  used or from a library.  You won't want to keep it.	1999-03-27

Fun, light, and original, these books will really be a hit with many teens and pre-teens.  <br />A SPELL FOR CHAMELEON, THE  SOURCE OF MAGIC, CASTLE ROOGNA, and CENTAUR AISLE are all great fun.  The  Xanth books after that go downhill.  The author dwells too much on small  children, or animal characters who have more smarts and common sense than  most adults.	1999-03-27

I dare say someone who has taken all the lessons in this book could fly a Cesna without too much difficulty.	1998-04-18
