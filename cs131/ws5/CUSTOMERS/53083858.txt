I am now going to order all of his other works. He is is in the same clss as Michael Connolly, Nelson DeMille, Robert Crais, Clive Cussler, William Diehl, James Lee Burke, Stephen Hunter, Susan Issacs, Faye Kellerman, Jonathon Kellerman, Dennis Lahane, Elmore Leonard, David Morrell and Robert Tannenbaum. His plotting is marvelous; his prose is outstanding; and his characters are exciting. Nothing more you can want from a writer. DON'T MISS READING THIS ONE!!!	2002-12-08

Now I know you can't trust awards. This work defies genre characterization. It certainly is not a mystery (beyond why anyone would publish it). It is not a thriller. It is  not a romance.

I read the author's &quot;Critical Care&quot; and liked his humor and  his apparent medical knowledge or research, so I read this novel. I had visited Africa for two days during two cruise ship stops. What I read was mind boggling over what I saw with my eyes.

Can you believe the Christian Right is so upset with Kate Fansler (a leading feminist) that they kidnap her husband and inform Kate that the ransom is Kate must cause a notice to be printed in the public press that she has renounced feminism! Silly. The author has often &quot;pushed&quot; feminism in her novels, but not to this extent. The ostensible mystery is really no mystery at all. The author did much better with THE IMPERFECT SPY, THE JAMES JOYCE MURDERS, POETIC JUSTICE and IN THE LAST ANALYSIS. Those novels were each a 10! The author's prose is ALWAYS delicious and that was the saving grace on this novel (otherwise this novel would rate a 1 from me).I am giving this author up; if I want to read about feminism, there is enough non-fiction around.	1998-06-06

I thought from her past books she was a serious writer of the mystery thriller genre. Boy, did I make a mistake. With this novel, she enters the romance market. Move over Catherine Coulter! You now have a competitor who would rather write about romance. John  Grisham,Lawrence Block, James Lee Burke, Tom Clancy,Michael Connelly, Robert Crais, Clive Cussler, Nelson Demille, Jane Evanovich,Elizabeth George,Stephen Hunter, Robert B. Parker, T, Jefferson Parker,Ridley Pearson and Mary Willis Walker have one less competitor in their genre. What a disappointment! A 4 hour waste of time reading this book.

Do yourself a favor and read this suspense thriller. I read his first novel and loved it, but he kind of disappeared from the bookshelves. This one came to my attention by ACCIDENT! And am I happy that it did. A real joy to read this novel. I can hardly wait for his next	1997-08-07

You will miss a GREAT READ if you miss reading this one! My next step is to order all the Thomas Perry books I haven't read yet	1997-07-12

But, when you can spend several hours of &quot;escape&quot; in a novel,for me it is a fun read! And this was. The Supreme Court in action via the judge's clerks is new and interesting. The interaction among the clerks and their friends is amusing. What more can you ask? I thoroughly enjoyed it and look foward to his next	1997-06-30

The most convoluted mystery I recall reading in a long, long time. So many characters. So many flashbacks. So many twists and turns. The author has a few scenes about a lady in South Africa...and  I still can't figure out her connection with the plot. Like Patricia Cornwall, I suppose Minette Walters can screw up once every few books - but it is a shame after her previous books which were all terrific!I will say to her credit, the lady can sure write prose	1997-06-05

The author takes a good plot and ruins it by appealing to a gay audience. As a heterosexual  I hated this book. I squirmed during the  author's description of sexual acts between gay men and the leading character's homosexual thoughts.No, I wouldn't have squirmed if there was a description of sex acts between men and women and if the leading character had heterosexual thoughts about the leading female character! But not being gay, I WAS JUST TURNED OFF BY THIS BOOK! If anything, reading the book may have made me homophobic! I hope not	1997-06-05

David Ignatius has surpassed his three previous times at bat and comes up with a GREAT ONE! William Diehl and Michael Connelly have their work cut out for them if they are  going to surpass the  fully developed characters, the intricate plotting,  the smashing climax and all the other elements that go to make a terrific read.I read about three suspense thrillers a week and this the BEST by far	1997-05-07

I was seduced by the advertising into believing  that this was a suspense thriller of the  kind made popular by Anne Perry and Minnette Walters.  Boy was I disappointed! It's pure romance! Suspense is purely incidental. Adler could have written a good thriller if she had left out ALL the romance and substituted  intricate plotting like Michael Connelly. She didn't and destroyed what might otherwise  have been a good read	1997-04-28

I put down the book after 10 pages and was prepared to discard it. And then I thought, the writer couldn't be this bad. WAS I WRONG! She is not going to get me next time. It will be 0 degrees in Los Angeles before I read another book written by this author.What can we sufferers do? Spread the word what a stinker this is. I would like to file a class action suit on behalf of all the readers who thought this was a &quot;suitable&quot; book - it wasn't suitable for the purpose sold - enjoyment. I'm furious to have wasted my time.   Gerald Lipsky (onetoten@westworld.com)	1997-02-21
