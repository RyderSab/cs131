Maddie is a young woman who is living in Boston and illness in her family brings her back to her roots where she meets Jace. In my opinion, Wick spends way too much time dwelling on the same issues and the book lacks action and intrigue. However, I will probably read book 2, just not in a great hurry to do so.	2005-09-18

As seemed typical for the era, gold and silver fever flourished as did houses of ill repute. All played a very important roll in the life of young Amy. The author saved a huge surprise for the readers for which even I was not prepared.  I assume this is the beginning of a series.	2005-09-14

Her car is stolen with all its' contents and she is forced to make friends with total strangers and work in a bookstore by getting advance pay. Steve is eccentric and untrusting since his mother died and his fiance dumped him, so he is the last person to want to help Alessi.  However, the lot falls to him. His life is changed in the most unlikely of ways...perhaps this was my favorite part of the book.  <br /> <br /> <br />A small town contemporary Christian love story, this is very different for this author, and I will continue to read her other types, I was not too fond of the halo theory.	2005-04-07

Dianne really tries, pulls more than her weight, but finally her strength is gone...and she is pregnant, unknown yet to Cole.  <br /> <br />Cole has been harboring a secret fear of restarting the ranch back in Montana and feels it never really was his but Dianne's and more truly, Koko's and her children's.  <br /> <br />In his tender moments, he tries to please all the women in his life and finds this is impossible and he loses the most important one.

Opal feels guilty because so many other fine people suffer because of her mistake. <br /> <br />I had trouble keeping track of the stories the author jumped between until they all sort of became one story. It was rather difficult to introduce new characters and then have them to become part of the old gang, but it turned out ok to do so in that manner. <br /> <br />Ruby and Rand continue to be the Christian backbones of this family and lead their extended families and hands to the knowledge of Jesus Christ as Saviour whenever possible. <br /> <br />Parts of this book were TOO predictable, others were totally surprising, and all in all, I did enjoy this book 3.	2005-03-20

Quillan has agreed to take Carina back to her beloved Sonoma and family. Their journey is nothing compared to what awaits them when they finally do arrive....  Here is your typical Italian family who demands that protocol be followed, a very handsome (and faithless) ex-lover for whom we have been waiting 3 whole books to find out about, and then there is Papa. All of them will surprise and alternately anger and please the reader.  <br /> <br />This last book of the series is probably my favorite. The real, deep and eternal love between Carina and Quillan shows so clearly I just wanted to SHAKE the whole family for their negativity, but, in the process I learned to respect and love Quillan and Carina all the more. Total love is being willing to let go if necessary, however painful. <br /> <br />Filled with lots of action and suspense, obviously, the author could not allow this to be a \\"happily ever after\\" without a firey trial of pain, raw emotions and near death for some of the main characters.....without revealing anything, I will just say, buy all three books at one time and you will never have to wait for the sequel..   <br /> <br />A very excellent historical, Christian fiction love story and one that older teens should definitely read.

Problem is, she really does not have a \\"husband\\" in the truest sense of the word. <br /> <br />Determined to make it on her own, Carina occupies her original little house and becomes the darling of the mine and professional men by cooking her original Italian dishes and starting her own restaurant. We are introduced to Alex, the man brought in to oversee and perhaps run the mine owned now by Quillan and D.C.  He plays a huge role in this book and the reader cannot quite decide if he is terribly good or terrible cunning. Obviously, Carina and Alex have mutual respect for each other, or is it more?  <br /> <br />The cave of Quillan's parents still haunts and draws Carina and she discovers Wolf's \\"own diary\\" and now owns both his Mother's and his Dad's stories. <br /> <br />A horrible accident at the mine and a subsequent humanitarian act by Carina causes a major uproar, ending up with a savage beating and the reader is brought to tears.  <br /> <br />Definitely a page turner and I am already a good ways into book three.

Carina is running from a broken heart and hate for her sister. Instead of the \\"home\\" she has purchased, she finds herself in a tiny, canvas stall-type room and working for a dubious person, the only one who seemingly was willing to help. But, he had a motive. A dark one.    Quillan, both hero and scoundrel at times, plays a huge role in Carina's life. He harbors and lives a secret too painful to face. His only real friend is one legged Cain, a truly powerful Christian man whom Quillan would love to call his dad.     Mae and Emie become friends of Carina and she also finds some comfort in the priest and livery hands, but is forced to be near a horrible man she cannot figure out.    This book is set in the historical era many call the rush for silver and gold and lust and debauchery are in their heyday. Carina wonders if she has lost her mind trying to re-establish her life by coming to this small mining town. Some strike it rich while others become paupers, a few remain truthful while a sizable group become rogues and take orders from a ruthless man.    Throughout the entire book, Carina is constantly drawn to the Rose Mine/tunnel, riding there, spending time there, and trying to figure out the mystery this hole contains and why it has such a hold on her. \\"Wolf\\" figures to be part of the entire series but so far, not much is known about him.    The author does a great job of leading you straight to book 2. Thanks for a new twist to a Christian, historical, fictional book Kristen.	2005-02-16

Kristen does a great job weaving the pain, the guilt and hopes each biological parent have for their daughter, Kelsey. One cannot read this book without understanding real, true Christianity and ministry as modeled by a very, very acutely sick little girl. Quite honestly, words do not do this story justice.

I rarely read contemporary fiction, but this author made me curious-- along with some recommendations from other readers. I was not disappointed.  <br /> <br />This book is set in the foothills of Colorado's majestic Rocky Mountains and features a young woman running from an abusive past. It's a whole other lifestyle, and she meets many meaningful people, two of whom affect the rest of her life. The contrast between her rich past and current penny pinching, her need for God, and her fear with love are done very well by this author.  <br /> <br />I have already purchased book 2, which features Morgan.	2004-12-22

Abbie has, once again, found herself at odds with an important person in her life, her current husband, Cole. I admired Cole during this entire book and wanted to shake Abbie several times. I felt she was unrealistic in her expectations of Cole, and she made entirely TOO much difference between her small son by Monte and her adopted daughter Jenny. I particularly enjoyed (and also cringed) at the reappearance of the band of outlaws who finally come for a showdown. Emotions ran high and feelings ran deep in this finale by Heitzmann. Personally, for me, there was a bit too much violence in this one book, but it was necessary for the outcome. I am looking forward to another series or single book by her.	2004-12-08

Just as she begins to wonder, a stranger rides onto the ranch and beats Cole severely immediately before bounty hunters come and violently take Cole away for the murder of an El Paso woman, a lady of the night with whom Cole's brother, Sam was in love.  <br /> <br />Consuming a good portion of the whole book is the long journeys most of the main characters are making to El Paso and back, leaving the children, 7 and 4 behind in the care of Abbie's parents. The journey is long and hard, unlikely characters from past books appear and one surprise after another lands Abbie in El Paso, visiting Cole in jail. She has a hard time really knowing if he is innocent or guilty, but someone does know, and Abbie feels she owes it to Cole to find out the truth. After all, he has saved her life on several occasions. Her faithful young stable hand, Will, is by her side, helping in every way he can.   <br /> <br />A circuit rider preacher has accompanied Cole part of the way on this trip and Cole has decided he needs to know God. However, Abbie has a hard time believing he really has changed. The author throws in some difficult situations with Cole's past and his family's tragedies and some real surprises in this book which features mainly, the life, the hanging charges and the changes which take place in the lives of Abbie Farrell and Cole Jasper.  <br /> <br />I already have the next book ready to start.

This causes division between herself and Monte. At the same time, too many bad things are happening, Monte cannot explain them, but he vows to find the culprit. Cole is showing his true personality and loyalty throughout this whole book. I like him more and more all the time. Relatives from the defeated South have come to live with the newlyweds which turns out to be one long, horrid nightmare both financially and emotionally. The orphan children all have to have a home and Abbie volunteers without consulting Monte! <br /> <br />The town is growing, the train is coming and with it the threat of low life living, gambling, drinking and ladies of the night. When a family member becomes entangled in this mess, the whole area is affected and Abbie and Monte both have their lives threatened and attacked. <br /> <br />The author is developing an excellent story line for this new Colorado territory settlement, keeping Christ front and center with love at the root but the scars from the Civil War keep playing their part in the strife. Abbie's love for Monte along with her spontaneous and sometimes deadly decisions and actions cause her to extend herself and she ends up paying dearly. Living in her home is a snobbish, impossible sister in law who makes life in general torment for Abbie. <br /> <br />When a 14 yr. old girl ends up as a pawn in a horrible railroad land deal gone sour, the reader wonders just what makes some people tick. Suspicion, danger, violence and tragedy contine to dog this little family for whom the reader has now established a fondness. <br /> <br />This book has definitely improved and deepened over book one, and I have already started book 3 in this series.

The first sections were a bit uneventful, but as the plot started to form, there were many exciting things that made this book about early Colorado settlers come alive. Abbie is a strong, tomboyish girl who matures and loves and lives with her whole heart. Her deep devotion to Monte is shattered when he steps off the stage escorting a wife whom Abbie was NOT expecting. The author combines family, the remains of the Civil War, and Indians in this first of a series. I am already into book 2 and appreciate the readers who suggested I try this author.

However, a turn of events between Sadie and Leah keep the reader on edge. An old letter reappears after all these years.

They are determined to drive out the Selbys even if they have to lie, cheat and do horribly evil things. Chester has two of his sons working with him and of course his biggest asset of all is his wife (or is she really a liability?). A big surprise comes from two of the evil family's children.

Two Black girls, two White girls and a baby try to keep the plantation going and keep away any people who might do them harm. Working harder than ever is the new Mistress of the plantation, a mere 15 yr. old girl. She now oversees a very young girl and a somewhat mentally challenged new mother with a small son. Most of the people are either running or hiding from danger. <br />This second book brings into focus the viciousness of the baby's father and his intent on getting rid of both mother and baby. What follows is dynamic love and perserverance and the ugliness of some men's minds and their wicked meanness is almost too much to absorb. <br />The girls are maturing quickly and when the bank loan comes due with no money to be had, reposession is a very immediate possibility. This is where the book gets its' title, a real friend materialized and the harmony they show and their hard work pay off. <br />Today I finished book two and today I purchased book 3 in this series. I feel almost like family now and simply must know the future for these young people. Thank you Michael Phillips for this series.	2004-07-11

I can see the possibility of a great series coming, but this first book seems to dwell mainly on the devastation of the Civil War.

Somehow I felt Tracie Peterson went a bit heavy on the sad stuff, but perhaps that was the way it was. Dianne is featured along with her family which continues to decrease due to various reasons and some very tragic circumstances. <br />Diane and her Mother want to take the family and flee the war in Missouri- so- without her Father, they leave on a wagon train for Montana. If anything else went wrong there would not have been a book to write! Whites hating Blacks, Indians hating Whites, families in turmoil and through it all, a thread of hope and the Gospel. Enough happiness and success is present to continually nudge the reader to finish.<br />Tracie did a great job with proof of cultural differences and the grief they could cause through other people, especially in dealing  with the marriage of Bram and Koko. <br />I am anxious for book 2 in this series.

I am a huge fan of Beverly Lewis's books, but was just about to lay this one aside when it FINALLY started to get interesting and then - wow! <br />Leah is the main character and her value and worth are never questioned, especially with the decisions she is called to make. The twins Hannah and Mary Ruth are young ladies now, but their hearts pull them in different directions. Sadie, the shunned oldest daughter is ever in the background until the last few pages. Somehow I feel we have not heard the last of her first, huge sinful encounter which resulted in her banning. I was pleased to see the doctor's family more fully integrated into this book.<br />Abram and his wife have raised some different children with sharp minds and this book shows the reader the apparent differences and outcomes. The Amish community is beginning to lose some of their young people to the more liberal Mennonites, much to the chagrin of Dat and the bishop. Speaking of Dat, he is portrayed as stubborn, spiteful, and finally softening. <br />Leah has my admiration and is definitely the star of this book. Her life and relationship to some special little people will pull at your heartstrings. <br />This book is chock full of surprises and intrigue and Beverly Lewis has plenty to draw from when she releases book 4, &quot;The Prodigal&quot; in October, 2004. I am very excited to order it in advance. <br />If the whole book had been like the last fourth of the book then it would have been 5+ stars. If just half the book had been, it would have gotten 4. However, this time Lewis took entirely too long to get to the meat and heart of the book, hence, 3 stars.	2004-05-15

Leaving in secret, she takes a job as school teacher in the Dakota wild where we left off with book 1. Ruby has now created a reputable hotel and restaurant and determines to &quot;look out for the girls&quot; per her dying father's request. <br />However, her little sister, Opal, is another story. Precocious and friendly, a bit on the wild side, Opal is ripe for adventure and danger. Her love for her new home and the people is surpassed only by her love of horses.  Ruby has NO idea this will lead to such lengths.<br />Belle is still a thorn in Ruby's side, a worldly woman who is bent on keeping booze, smoking and money skimming off the card games all of which become a real burden and pain for Ruby who loves God and wants to make a clean, respectable home for everyone.<br />Many are moving to this area and Snelling does a great job integrating their lives with those already here. Obviously the army and the cattle ranchers will be featured heavily along with the &quot;girls&quot; that Per left behind. Rand the rancher is a mystery character whom the author weaves into this story with great mystery and warmth.<br />A school of sorts is started, Pearl learns that riches and her former spoiled life do not compare with living simply, working hard and having real friends and peace of mind. She meets a young man with her same love of books and then suddenly, before she can make decisions and put down permanent roots her father appears out of the blue demanding she return to Chicago.<br />The first real Christmas is a highlight and touching part of this book, bringing in hints of further things to come.  However, the personal lives of the characters are as different as night and day, yet somehow the same. <br />Snelling allows the reader to glimpse into folks in love, those harboring hate, lots of simplicity and the awfulness of head lice.<br />A few relationships are somewhat predictable and the writing is quite simple - otherwise, I would give the storyline and the book 5 stars. I am already anxious for book 3 in this series. Thank you Lauraine Snelling.	2004-05-06

Evelyn did a great job explaining the home and family side of Rick Husband. Yes, she was proud of his accomplishments but also listed some of his faults which was refreshing. NASA is not easy on its men and women and Evelyn made that very clear while not blaming them for Rick's death, either. Rick's determination and his resolve were certainly tested but his faith and drive never faltered. All in all the book gives a well rounded view of life as an astronaut as told through the eyes of the one closest to him, his wife. I congratulate Evelyn for her brave tribute to Rick and his 6 very close friends who met death the same day and in the same manner. Thanks, Evelyn.	2004-04-07

The decade of 1930-1940 was aptly named The Great Depression.  Part of it was cause, part effect, but all combined it was the most devastating financial decade of our history. Perhaps the abrupt change from the prosperity and hilarity of the Roaring Twenties caused the difference to seem even greater. <br />Although not everyone was affected, middle class America was stunned. Folks who had just purchased nice homes and had good jobs suddenly found themselves without either, living with friends or relatives and relying on handouts. This was a truly stressful time. Unemployment approached 25% and even those who were working took less pay and literally had to stand in line for jobs. Soup lines and kitchens were a common sight in large cities. <br />The stock market had just collapsed and businesses went under, people lost their life savings and some committed suicide, so great were their losses. People later remembered having only mustard in the house to eat. Others ate at the dumps. Others in relief food lines. Even though a loaf of bread was only a nickel, one could expect another hungry person to steal the bread right out of their arms. One dollar a month was too much for some people to pay for electricity and their homes went dark. <br />On top of the dismal economic picture, the weather and nature dealt an equally nasty hand. Drought, pests and dust destroyed what little crops farmers had been able to plant. This phenomena stretched from Texas up to North Dakota. The Dust Bowl claimed even more families. Thousands of farmers were forced to leave property, family and all they knew and head to California in hopes of finding farm work. Perhaps because I WAS ONE OF THOSE SMALL CHILDREN this particular era and book was especially poignant to me. John Steinbeck captured it in book form in \\"Grapes of Wrath\\". <br />Hoover was president, and he believed that the government should stay out of the private sector.  However, with the election of Franklin Delano Roosevelt, thefederal government DID step in to provide some sense of dignity to its' population. The New Deal and the Civilian Conservation Corps started men planting trees, laying roads, cleaning up woods and beaches and America had some jobs. Finally, the WPA (Works Progress Administration) provided 2 million more jobs in construction and even the arts were revived. The Tennessee Valley Authority (TVV) provided dams and power plants to areas impoverished by the droughts. <br />Roosevelt believed folks needed companionship, so he started his famous \\"Fireside Chats\\" in which he became the first president to use radio to bring information and comfort to the American public. His wife Eleanor became the first publicly active president's wife, visiting schools and paying particular attention to the needs of Black children.<br />Just when it looked like the Great Depression was ending, and the song \\"Happy Days are Here Again\\",  another downswing occurred. Workers started demanding better pay, owners balked and sit down strikes threatened to paralyze America. Memorial Day, 1937 was labeled as the Memorial Day Massacre when strikes turned to bloodshed at a steel plant and ten strikers died and ninety others were seriously injured. <br />In the midst of the chaos, a few \\"saviors\\" began to appear. Huey Long became a famous politician, promising to \\"put a chicken in every pot\\" by a plan to tax the rich and provide a $5,000 home and guaranteed annual income for all Americans. However, at his height of popularity, he was killed by an assassin. Dr. Francis Townsend devised a scheme to help the elderly with a monthly pension.  Perhaps the most popular politician was a Catholic priest, Charles E. Coughlin, who used  radio to reach America, and eventually started blaming international bankers and week by week  became more and more anti-Jewish. <br />Folks turned to simple pleasures and past times to entertain themselves and their families...using inexpensive table games like checkers -- and Monopoly was born. Listening to the radio continued to gain in popularity. A special treat was listening to favorite singers, comedy acts and programs which allowed phoning in votes...this gave a shaky audience a sense of value and worth. Movies which provided temporary escape could be visited for only ten to twenty-five cents. \\"Gone With the Wind\\" and \\"Wizard of Oz\\" became famous and remain so to this day. <br />Since the Great Depression turned out to be world-wide, the political climate was ripe for dictators and totalitarian governments.  Hence, the dark clouds of war arose. Hitler invaded Poland in 1939, and America began preparing for war. <br />Ironically, the very thing that provided jobs for millions....war.....also handed America the bloodiest  combat in their young history. World War II was just over the horizon and America was set to learn a new set of restrictions and say good-bye to their sons and fathers as they faced a second world war. <br />R. Conrad Stein does a tremendous job of bringing 10 years of history to America's school children or adult literacy students. He also provides a good, quick and accurate brush up course for those of us who might have forgotten.	2003-05-25

Stein writes an excellent yet simple book to explain the tumultuous years between 1920 and 1930. <br />Described succinctly as the decade when \\"the parties were bigger...the pace was faster...the morals were looser and the liquor was cheaper\\" (F. Scott Fitzgerald)..it started when the nation was recently scarred by a war and ended when humbled by depression.<BR>  <BR>The United States was looking for some fun and relief. Prohibition caused major division and illegal actives to flourish. Folks went wild, \\"speakeasies\\" became as popular as backyard stills.<br />Listening to a radio became the most popular home pastime in this decade. The automobile was perhaps the most widespread invention. Just for the rich a few years previous, this decade brought mass production, lowered the prices and by 1929, 23 million cars were on the road. <br />The youth of this decade were especially interested in crazy fads and feats. Flappers showed off more body than the world had seen to that point. Dances like the Charleston were fast, crazy and infectious. <br />Financially, the stock market became lucrative and many at the top were instant millionaires. However, at the other end were the ethic minorities and dirt farmers who got poorer and poorer. The KKK flourished, affecting politics and the morality of the nation. Literature began to reach the masses. Babe Ruth was a national hero. <br />1927 saw the first talkie movie. Stars became giants to the general public. Lindbergh became the first man to fly across the Atlantic alone. However, his success was quickly followed by the kidnapping of his infant son. <br />Crime flourished and a major leader was Al Capone. The White House was not immune to schemes, the most famous was The Teapot Dome affair. Women voted for the first time in the election of 1920.<br />The flash and success of this decade ended quite suddenly, when in the fall of 1929, stock prices began to drop and panic ensued. October 24, 1929, was called Black Thursday, withan incredible flurry of selling, causing more price drop. The following Terrifying Tuesday, so many shares were unloaded that the market collapsed entirely. Not only stock holders, but those with money in the bank lost, because the banks had invested most of their customer's money in stocks as well. In just one week, the fortunes of the rich and the savings of the poor were all wiped out, causing the worst financial disaster in history.<br />The decade of wealth, easy living, fun, hilarity and parties was suddenly over. The following decade would come to be known as the Great Depression.<br />I highly recommend this book and this series for teaching history of the United States to children, or refreshing memories of adults.  I find it helpful in teaching adult literacy.	2003-05-09

Using this kids'book as a reader for adult literacy classes is <BR>great! It reveals  many things that most have not heard nor realized.  I found it shocking the way that illnesses were tracked.  A huge H written on ones' coat meant they were a heart patient, Sc meant scalp problems, etc. The most dreaded was a large X which indicated a mental patient. They were asked personal questions such as how much money they had and if they could read or had ever been in prison. Sometimes all but one member would be accepted and the family had to decide what to do. <br />Obviously, most came looking for a better life but the trip over the ocean was dangerous, long and uncomfortable, since there were three classes on the voyage and most immigrants could only afford the cheap, bottom of the boat cramped quarters. Many got ill and died. Varied languages caused further loneliness. <br />Families were often split up forever, it was not an easy thing to decide to come to America.  Most would never be able to visit their motherland again..ever. Around 2% of the total were sent back home and this fear was with each immigrant that made it alive to Ellis Island.<br />They were told NOT to tell anyone they had a job waiting, for this was against the international laws and they would be punished. If all went well, their stay on Ellis Island was about 5 hours.<br />Since most immigrants were poor and had no money to get further than New York City, it quickly became a melting pot for Italians, Germans, Irish, Jewish and Polish.  It was said one could tell where you were in the city just by opening your window at mealtime and smelling the spices and dishes from each country.<br />Learning English and integrating into American life came easier for children than adults. Most adults clumped together in small areas according to language and heritage, shopping at familiar stores and cooking and eating familiar foods.<br />Ellis Island was eventually shut down, then reopened and restored and is now a museum. For many, the most important letters they saw were those on the door that said \\"PUSH TO NEW YORK CITY\\" and they did.	2003-04-19

However, change has come in the form of huge brick mills replacing the farms.  Lilly is sad and she is angry. Already she has lost both her parents, and her scoundrel brother has gambled away their inheritance. Alone and bitter, Lilly is determined to be a one-woman show who ultimately will bring down the mills.<br />Apparently the whole town is split. The town even lost its name. Rows of boarding houses with up to 8 girls a room now line the streets. Lilly is not one to cave in, but when she realizes that some of the very people who were part of her loving past have now accepted the mills, she is a bit confused: especially about Matthew, a former farm boyfriend turned mill executive.<br />Lilly feels dejected and ends up one of the mill-girls in an attempt to gain her farm community back.<br />Although this series shows potential, I found it slow getting started and void of real suspense and my interest waned at times. I would buy book 2 though, just for the simple fact of the author.	2003-02-28

Many of them sneaked off to France to enter flight school. But when President Roosevelt ordered the formation of the 99th Fighter Squad, the Black men started their flight training at the Tuskeegee Institute of Alabama, an all-Black school founded by Booker T. Washington, a former slave himself.  The first experiment consisted of 13 students of which only 5 finished the schooling. Classes followed, and finally, orders were for the Black pilots to go to North Africa to fly P-40 Warhawks.  Their mission was to protect the large American bombers. The Black pilots showed their knowledge and their patriotism in spite of the fact the officer's clubs were still segregated.  The only place they were completely equal was in a prisoner of war camp. However, while acceptance of Blacks as pilots was starting to happen in the war, back home in America, the integration issue was just heating up and about to explode. This book is an excellent glance into the history of Black American Military pilots.	2002-06-28

It is a Caldecott Honor Book and I am very familiar with picking cotton.  I was born the daughter of a cotton share-cropper, so my earliest memories are some of the very same things that appear in this book.<br />Cotton picking by hand is hard.  It is backbreaking, and the days are hot and long.  However, I had a few concerns about this book.  It is written in the local dialect and speech patterns of the Black child who is telling the story.  It was rather difficult to read but easy to understand what she meant.  Since this is a child's book, I am not certain that every child would understand the language system that is portrayed. A teacher needs to be completely aware and ready to explain the dialect. <br />Also, even though the child describes a typical day of cotton picking, hard, hot, long,and lonely for socialization, I do wish the fact had been brought out that other ethnicities picked cotton as well as Blacks.  It is hard work no matter who picks the cotton. <br />The illustrations were done nicely and the family structure was portrayed as intact.  However, it reminded me all too well of the long, hot days my family spent in the cotton fields.	2002-03-18

Faith's adventure has her answering an ad to become the bride of wealthy Nicholas Shepherd in his mid thirties.  He resides in Deliverance, TX with his mother. Liza. <br />Faith's unusual arrival in Deliverance is only the beginning of some rather bizarre occurances which prevent the wedding from taking place several times. Instead, Faith tests the patience of Liza her future mother in law by preferring outside, tomboy activities to domestication.  Faith cannot figure out what makes this man and his mother tick, since they seem to have plenty of money but refuse to spend it, and although they are rich and well known, they still do not seem very happy with life.<br />As Faith becomes acquainted with the townspeople and church folks, she is especially fond of little five year old Adam, who is blind. His father, Dan, is a young widow with two other children.  Since Faith is not married yet, she feels free to help Dan out with the children.  This act of kindness causes her great distress from Liza and distrust and jealousy from Nicholas.<br />Although the book introduces many different families, it centers on Faith's adventures as she seeks to establish her worth while wondering if her marriage is ever going to take place.  The one single obstacle she cannot overcome is the selfish, moody, controlling mother of her fiance.  Liza is a widow who now refuses to  relinquish her hold on her only child, Nicholas. <br />Nicholas puts his work and his cattle ranch above anything else, and postpones the wedding once more to prevent leaving a young bride home alone while he is out on a cattle drive.  It is during his absence that Faith pursues her dream to start a school for the blind since she cares so deeply for little Adam and wants to teach him to read. Liza does NOT share this dream and in a very ugly scene, she issues an untimatum to Faith that leads to dire consequences.  When Nicholas returns, he is shocked, sad and angry.<br />The end result is worth the read, and I am anxious to get to book two in this series, Brides of the West.	2002-03-15

Neighbors do not want &quot;those wild Indians&quot; living near them and make life miserable, culminating in a very, very intense encounter for Genevieve. <br />As a war breaks out, Daniel serves as guide for the Army and little Aaron whom we met as a small boy in earlier books, has enlisted as a &quot;junior&quot; recruit.  It is during this war that Daniel Two Stars faces one of the biggest challenges of his life and his marriage.

When he does, he cannot believe what he overhears two boys saying about his little girl whom he trusts.<br />At this point, he makes some decisions which result in the girl making her own.  The story is based on the Prodigal Son in the Bible, and even though Hill wrote it around 1938 or 1940 at first, the problems are the same, just the approaches have changed.  I am happy there have been continuous reprintings and new covers to attract the current generation of young girls. It is still fun to read.<br />I would, to this day,  buy and give this book as a gift or as a prize.  I kept my very first copy and it is among my most treasured books.	2002-02-05

Books	3	16	18	N	N	Kind, but  Unrealistic Solution to Complex Problem	I am sure Ms. Shriver has the goal of helping to making life easier on kids with disabilities, but she glosses over a really complex set of circumstances.  <br />This book highlights the fact that others stare at the handicapped. A \\"normal\\" little girl is attempting to find out why Timmy looks and acts differently.  Her mother attempts to explain carefully the similarities she shares with Timmy instead of the differences. The mother shares a story from her own childhood in which she was uncomfortable the first time she actually met a child in a wheelchair.  <br />The little girl has difficulty understanding what \\"disabled\\" means and her mother tries to make it as simple as possible, yet complete. The mother decided the best way to explain was for the girl to actually meet and talk with Timmy. Kate is surprised to hear Timmy say his feelings are hurt when people call him \\"retarded\\" because she never thought of that before. Kate decides to invite Timmy to play ball with her and her other friends. The other children stare at Timmy at first, but one by one they all accept him with his disability and the game is started - (this part of the book was a little too fairy tale and certainly not realistic, unfortunately). <br />It was encouraging to me the reader,  when Katie's Mom tried to explain that God makes lots of different kinds of people and that friendship with others less \\"able\\" can be a very positive experience.  <br />The end of the book has the little girl deciding that there is nothing at all wrong with Timmy.<br />Being the parent of a mentally retarded daughter, I felt this book was a nice attempt at a very complex subject.  However, real life just does NOT deal out many pleasant experiences to most of our handicapped children.  Unfortunately, it is a long, hard uphill battle for them to become even marginally accepted.  Rarely does a \\"normal\\" child so quickly end up with the perception that there is \\"nothing, - nothing at all\\" wrong with \\"Timmy.\\"	2002-02-02

It is done very well, with enough of the familiar to make the reader comfortable, enough new to keep interest and more than enough intrigue for me!<br />There are, again, four short books in one.  The first, The Heart's Calling, is Pamela's story.  She is a rebellious young woman who loves the shady Brady.  Her parents attempt to stop this destined to fail romance and send her away to live with her grandmother.  While there,  sulking and hoping to run away, she is suddenly abducted, but not by the man she hopes has come for her. Threading the story back to book one, the reader immediately knows why the kidnapping happened and who it was intended to save.  However, I am not sure who was the more surprised, the kidnapper or the victim! <br />Forever Yours follows, with 23 yr. old independent, stubborn Daughtry Lucas trying to escape the smothering she perceives she is getting from her father, Garrett.  As a remedy, she secretly answers a mail order bride ad. She decides to suddenly run away to accomplish her \\"freedom\\" all the while having no idea that even as she is using Nicholas Dawson, he is using her as well!  He is her ticket to freedom from her home and father, and he, himself has a less than open and fair agenda.<br />In number three, Angeline is chasing the cause of womens' right<BR> to vote.  She meets and follows a strong but deceptive Willa and an even more dastardly Douglas on the circuit for suffrage.  She is very young, headstrong and stubborn but finds herself in grave danger and finally realizes the value of an old childhood friendship.  But does she realize this just a bit too late? <br />The last story takes place a little later still - Come Away My Love.  Joelle Dawson plans to marry the handsome pilot son of the local town doctor, Daniel Monroe.  Howver, while they are engaged, John's horrible accident threatens their relationshop and redirects their lives. When John finds himself paralyzed, Joelle has some serious decisions to make.  John tries to make her hate him for the less than whole man he has become.  She, on the other hand makes his recovery her purpose in life.  In the small Texas town of his rehab, a horrible, violent accident takes its toll on Joelle.  This time, it's not only physical, it is mentally, emotionally and sexually destructive.  How do these two young Christians in love survive the incredible odds of ever finding happiness? This last story was my favorite of them all.  You will be surprised with the ending of this wonderful Tracie Peterson duo set in the young New Mexico wilderness.	2002-01-25

The authors do an excellent job of telling a modern story followed by the Biblical story then tie the two together.  The Good Samaritan brings home the meaning so very well for kids.  I would recommend this book or cassette for Children's Church or for home Bible study.  It would also be good for young homeschoolers.	2002-01-05

Four stories in one book and all are good!  The first three deal with the same general cast but each features a different family.  The last story is detached from the first three and actually sounds like a different author or certainly a different slant.<br />A Place to Belong features the life of Maggie, a wealthy young woman who refuses to be united with her estranged father.  Only a threatened kidnapping changes her mind and subsequently her life.  Perfect Love highlights the lives of Lillie and Dr. Daniel Monroe.  Both have suffered horrible loss.  Both are unbending when it comes to personal wants.  The author does a fine job blending their complicated lives.  Tender Journeys is Jenny's story.  Actually, the reader may be a tad confused at the placement of this story in the book but finally one gets the connection.  Jenny was orphaned by Apache Indians and hates them completely until she is forced to live with them. I was completely surprised in this one. Several excellent twists finally are evident even though the storyline moves somewhat slowly in places.  The last story, The Willing Heart is the life of Zandy and Riley.  He is the one character you can detest. Easily. Corrupt and wealthy from gambling and owning the whole town, he always gets what his money and power can buy.  The one thing that is out of his reach is Zandy.  Although she and her family suffer horribly for her moral standards, the outcome of the last book is definitely worth the whole thing.<br />Book 2 is titled New Mexico Sunset which I have already purchased. Way to go Tracie, and thanks for some excellent Christian Fiction reading!	2001-12-26

Since it is Christmas the stories were relevant, and since we have servicemen and women overseas the stories were certainly poignant.  However, I think the third story was my favorite and one which could have happened to any couple in love and impatient during a war situation as Tracie wrote about WWII. That one, alone would get 4 stars, the others would not.	2001-12-24

I would definitely rethink my rating if Beverly Lewis had made each part another whole book, especially about Katie and Dan. They certainly deserve another sequel to continue the Shunning series. As for Philip and Rachel from Postcard/Crossing fame, another book surely is coming. The last part of this book brings back Sarah Cain. While her story is mostly about her new family of children, the author does manage a nice little twist by showing us the heart of Sarah now and combining characters from more than one past series/book.  I think there is more in the offing. At least I can hope.	2001-11-21

Book 6 in Canadian West features the life of Christine.  She is recovering from a near tragic relationship with Boyd from book 5, and World War II looms bigger and bigger.  Between jobs as the book opens, Christine attends the wedding of her big brother and meets another Mountie, Laray. Is it love? Unable to decided, Christine leaves and cares for her injured Aunt Mary. She discovers a worthwhile ministry at the local Hope Canteen, sharing Christ with young servicemen and women. An automobile accident proves pivotal for both the story line and Christine's life.  Oke introduces a handsome young resident at the hospital whose family helped found the town. Christine is torn about her future which seems to revolve around her beloved North. Oke has a very surprising ending to this book, one I was not prepared for nor particularly liked.  Hope this book is not the end of the series.	2001-10-23

Wall Walker is hired for new jobs and is probably the only really trusted man in town - however, he makes one big enemy while helping a woman regain her legal home. That enemy swears to do him in. <br />The two former feuding outlaw gangs have joined forces and made O.T. a seventh &quot;partner&quot; of sorts.

After all, he has literally run his wife into her sick bed in his quest for his dream of moving to California.

Their very poor friends the Rokkers are featured heavily in this book, starting when Elias goes off on a goose chase for gold after spending all his paycheck for a useless map. O.T. and Fergus have a harrowing adventure looking for the lost Elias and son in a horrible blowing dust storm. Just after the Rokker family takes refuge in the cafe, a mysterious explosion causes a sinkhole to open up and swallow their entire house and all their meager possessions. <br />Dola Skinner is featured heavily in this book. Though still young and pretty, she is feeling old and ugly. Her physical stamina is tested in hard work, her Bible teaching and mothering skills are challenged in the town she hates. Twelve year old Rita is feeling her hormones with a new hired hand and hates working alongside the sixteen year old, shapely new hired girl.

Famous visitors drop by to see the Skinners.<br />Dreams of California and grapevines seem a long way off, especially when the Skinners are thankful they finally have jobs, plenty of food and a sturdy roof over their heads.  In addition, there are so many people to help out in the wild, greedy, lustful town of Goldfield, NV.<br />Book three, &quot;Picture Rock&quot; is bound to be a winner!	2001-08-12

Several times I found myself actually frightened to be alone while reading... I am not accustomed to such evil goings on within a Christian fiction book. Melissa is a young married woman with some serious secrets in her past.  He husband Ryan has some skeletons as well.  Their marriage was less than open from the start although neither of them knew much. Mellie has to flee on short notice and chooses a Mennonite home in which to take refuge. The story is told by several flashbacks in which the pain of her past threatens to engulf her while the ugliness of the present threatens Ryan. Probably the nicest part of the book centers in Lancaster, PA, an area not spoiled with crime and deceit.<br />Although this book held my intrigue and refused to let go of my interest, I deducted 2 stars for the often drawn-out scenarios and the unbelievable instances that &quot;just happened&quot; to occur at exact, precise moments. I also was not prepared nor particularly fond of the dark, dark side of this book.  I found faith, trust and joy to be far from the characters and nearly out of reach.<br />I am not certain I would even read a sequel.	2001-07-29

Book two covers a lot of territory - some of the top Indians are offered jobs as escorted scouts for the Army.  Daniel Two Stars has finally gotten out of a living hell prison and is wearing an Army uniform and hunting renegade Indians. Genevieve LaCroix is serving as caregiver for Simon's children and orphaned baby Hope who was rescued by Gen and Daniel after the death of her parents. <br />The conditions of the Indians is deplorable - most of the children have died. Thousands are still sick, starving prisoners. Simon Dane buries himself in Indian missionary work but is frustrated at his limited resources. Simon is falling in love with the beautiful half-breed Dakota Indian, Blue Eyes (Gen) and even though she respects him in return, her heart still belongs to her true love, Daniel Two Stars who she believes is dead.<br />Elliott Leighton, Ellen's brother, enters the storyline and has one goal in mind - to prevent his sister's children from being raised in the wild West, OR by an Indian mother. He has been discharged from the Army after losing one arm and having his long hair turn white overnight. He travels to Simon's home to retrieve the children, having no idea the changes that await for him.<br />Jeb Grant is a pivotal figure in this book. He is a farmer who just cannot bring himself to hate all Indians and he opens his heart and his farm to questionable Indian activities.<br />Simon and Elliott accidentally run into Daniel while traveling in a storm during  an illness, and after learning that Gen is engaged to Simon, Daniel asks both men to promise not to tell her and to forget they ever saw him. This is NOT going to be easy to do but Daniel determines to leave her alone so she can have a better life.  Simon has a strange illness that persists, and among his many nurses are Mother Friend, Daniel, Elliott and Genevieve.<br />The devastation of the good Indian's homes and villages by soldiers and renegade Indians leaves families separated and thousands homeless,injured, starving and defeated. Several major questions are answered in this book:<br />1. Will Gen marry Simon even though they both know her heart belongs to the memories of Daniel Two Stars?<br />2. What will happen to an angry Elliott when he visits the Crow reservation?<br />3. What happens to Daniel who was reported as hanged? Will he ever see Blue Eyes again?<br />4. What is the fate of 5 orphaned children, including baby Hope?<br />5. Which is stronger, love, committment or duty? Is it possible for Simon, Blue Eyes(Gen) and Daniel to make the right choices in spite of their hearts?<br />I felt that Stephanie Grace Whitson reflected some of the pain of her own life in this book. Love, death, grief, faith, loyalty, overcoming and doing the right thing were foremost in the intrigue and interest this second book held. I give this book at least 15 stars for the mystery and suspense it generates particularly in the last 25 pages. Excellent writing skills Steph!<br />Book three in this series is due out in late 2001 and I am planning to order it well in advance.	2001-07-23

Just as Steve and Cathy are planning their wedding, her fifteen year old son Mark is picked up on a drug charge.  Angry, frustrated and guilt-ridden, Cathy calls off the wedding indefinitely.<br />The other members of Cedar Circle are secondary characters in this book. The Flaharty family is central. Nineteen+ year old Rick is preparing to leave for college. Eighteen year old Annie is in flux-she is a high school grad,and a pretty, somewhat materialistic girl.  Lacking a father's encouragement and love, her life is quite shallow until she commits to the biggest challenge of her young life.  Steve and Cathy have started major remodeling which cannot be postponed.  Mark's arrest places all the adults in precarious positions. Cathy is determined NOT to marry Steve until Mark approves or he is free.<br />Brenda and David Dodd are dealing with a son who is learning to drive. Tory and Barry are learning to parent and cope with the challenges of a baby with Downs. Tory's overprotectiveness and fear needs some adjustment, but is she ready?  Dr. Harry and Sylvia are still in Nicaragua, serving God and feeding the hungry. Their devotion is astonishing at their age. <br />Central to this story is the change that comes to Mark while he is incarcerated.  An unlikely source provides support, while his father, Jerry, keeps his distance, ashamed and angry at Mark for embarrassing him.  One Bible story in particular impacts Mark's life and when he is finally released, the story comes alive in its' greatest beauty, with both spirituality and human emotions.<br />I hope there is a fourth book in this series, featuring Dr. Harry and Sylvia, the missionaries.	2001-07-01

Four short stories and four different authors gave this book fast read quality but less than complete satisfaction for me with any of the four stories.<br />Since I must rate the entire book at once, I have to average the &quot;stars.&quot;  There are four stories of romance in strange circumstances.  First is Bride's Song in which Dora Grant, a nurse and city girl has to decide whether to keep her good job in the little town or follow her heart and become what she has vowed she never will - a homesteader's wife. This one would get 3 stars.  <br />Second, The Barefoot Bride is a touching, moving short story about a widow, Emma, whose odd mannerisms and talking out loud to animals and nature have caused the townsfolk to believe she is insane. She is shunned and feared and terribly alone, unable to keep her large farm going. She advertises locally and unsuccessfully for a husband of any kind just to keep her farm. Finally,  Matt Tolivar, a widowed doctor, comes through town and is looking for a place to hide and start his life over.  A very interesting relationship occurs and this is my favorite of the four novellas. I give it 4 stars.<br />Third, A Homesteader, a Bride, and a Baby concerns a city gal, Lorette coming to take over the raising of a baby orphaned by diphtheria and realizing she knows nothing about operating a farm  turns to a male helper with resulting ugly gossip from the townspeople. IF I could vote on Chase Lankford alone this one would get 5 stars because of his strength, wisdom, patience and his faith in God.  Since I have to consider the whole story, this one gets  1-2 stars from me.<br />The last, A Vow Unbroken, is a story of deceit and mystery, unusual deaths and a mail-order-bride story gone wrong. Very wrong. Pregnant, widowed Abby finds herself being exchanged from her expected housekeeper job to that of mail order bride, with horrible consequences and suspense.  I give this one 2 stars. <br />These four short stories have a decided Christiantheme with all decisions coming about only after those involved spend considerable time in prayer and Bible reading. All the stories take place in the 1800's and obviously from the title, on the prairie - just as it was being settled.  <br />I think this book would make excellent required reading for female homeschoolers or church groups perhaps for ages 13 - 18.	2001-06-24

I am so glad I waited for book six in this series because after book five I was ready to throw in the towel.  However, this one more than compensated my determination to finish the series!<br />Augusta- the oldest Bjorkland daughter is finally immigrating to the United States.  Her mother, Bridget is excited to have her join the staff of her new Boarding House in the town of Blessing. Henry has come into Bridget's life, but she is way too old for romance - or is she?<br />Kane is introduced in the book for the first time and is a bachelor-rancher who has sent for a mail order bride from Norway.  He lives a whole state away in South Dakota. A lost letter of explanation lends incredible suspense and disaster to his life.<br />A cluster of unavoidable situations and horrible consequences  because of language barriers lead to some exciting, troubling legal, spiritual and familial fiascoes which take emotional toll and tax the patience of the families of the participants.<br />The storyline does move from Blessing to the Ranch and the journeys of Hjelmer but Snelling does a great job keeping it systematized and integrated.  I found it somewhat frustrating to have to leave a character when the author chose to jump to a different location, but I understood her reasoning.<br />A good portion of the book is consumed with the search for Augusta, carried out by Hjelmer and Henry at the insistence of Bridget.  A generation gap complete with different expectations and considerably exclusive social mores causes part of this book to become a mystery as well. <br />Many of the original characters are now in the background, and this book primarily features Hjelmer, Bridget, Kane and Augusta.  The manner in which their lives become interwoven is masterfully orchestrated and carried out with intrigue, suspense and emotion.<br />I highly recommend the complete series of six books, and I recently learned that Lauraine Snelling has instituted a down-the-line-sequel series titled &quot;Return to Red River.&quot; The first book is called &quot;A Dream to Follow&quot; and I intend to read this new series as well.<br />I do think the author needs a finer tuned editing system to keep straight the names of her characters, but for the most part, the excitement of this final book in the series more than made up for the slight variations.	2001-06-15

The pastor is featured more as the teacher of the school.  Zeb's sister Mary Martha is prominent and Singer Sewing machines are introduced into the community.  This causes a huge rift between Penny and Goldie.  Ingeborg remains unable to conceive.  Sign language has come to Blessing in order to help little Grace communicate.  A fire in the grain house takes the life of a man traveling through.  Politics are in full gear, with debates and Hjelmer traveling for meetings. Mary Martha is called back home to nurse her ailing mother.  Little Anna contracts whooping cough and dies. Perhaps the central tragedy occurs with Katy during childbirth. Personally, I hope this book is a bridge to a happier conclusion of this series with book #6.	2001-06-08

There is finally a blacksmith and a merchantile in town. Penny's only known relative comes to join her. Haaken contracts mumps as they spread throughout the families, and the Bjorkland matriarch arrives with 4 others for vacationing -or is it a move? <br />A very dramatic incident occurs when Anner, an angry farmer, has a farm accident. <br />During a 6 wk absence of her husband and against all advise including his, Ingeborg returns to her britches and plowing and has a freak though serious accident.    Zeb MacCallister, a fugitive caring for orphans Manda and Deborah, joins the prairie families. Manda talks too much. <br />Blessing women are discussing the possibility of women's votes and the fact their area is about to become a state. Katy and Zeb are extremely attracted but speak completely different languages. <br />A bank is opening, several weddings take place, and near the end of the book Zeb sees his siter momentarily and gets a painful scare which forces him into an even more painful decision.<br />Despite a slight discrepancy in timeframes by the author, I am glad I already have purchased book 5 in this series.	2001-05-18

One twin is not healthy and Lars cannot accept his deaf daughter.  School is in full swing in the prairie schoolhouse, with Kaaren as teacher.<br />Ingeborg and Haaken travel a far distance by train to escort home the seriously injured younger sister of Kaaren.  Solveig is a bitter, disappointed young woman who was on her way to join her sister, but whose future is crushed in a train wreck.  Face scarred and barely walking, she goes home with Ingeborg and Haaken. Olaf, Kaaren's long lost uncle, mysteriously turns up after a long absence and his many talents make him useful and loved. <br />Penny has finally decided to travel to Fargo for work and further schooling.  The farms continue to progress - a large wooden barn now graces the homestead of Ingeborg who gives birth to another baby, Haaken's first biological child. Metiz continues to weave in and out of the lives of the pioneer families.  Her grandson, Baptiste, stays with his friend Thorliff to go to school and help with the farm work.<br />As much as she balks, Ingeborg gives up her plowing and hunting after teaching young Thorliff to take her place. As usual, tragedy does not pass over them without leaving scars.  A tragic fire, blizzards and failing farms cause loss of life and dreams.  Agnes give birth to a stillborn daugher.  She harbors intensive anger toward Hjelmer for hurting her dear niece, Penny.  <br />The railroad is coming and the time for proving up their land arrives.  Both the Bjorkland widows are remarried with families.  Extra people share both homes now.  A large sack house stores their grain for direct loading on the train.  <br />The book ends with their town becoming a water stop for the railroad, a real town with a real name, Blessing. In spite of the author's confusion with family relationships and forgetting Kaaren's married name, book 3 still deserves 4 stars.	2001-05-12

Ingeborg spends the next few months bitter - and dressed in her &quot;britches&quot; works the fields like a man.  This way, fatigue and distance keep her from facing the truth and more importantly, her children whom she nearly gives away to her sister.<br />Her sod-home neighbor and sister (by marriage), Karen, a widow, has accepted happiness in a new life and finally Ingeborg comes to terms and returns to the faith of her youth.  <br />The arrival of the distant cousin of her deceased husband, Haaken, eases the farm work but complicates the decision making. He is there ONLY to help the women with the farm for a crop season - or is he?  <br />The delinquent arrival of the young, spunky, opinionated youngest brother of Roald further turns Ingeborg's world upside down, emotionally.

Land, heritage, religion and culture enters into the clash which results in horrible bloodshed on all sides.<br />A haunting love story unfolds between Gen (Blue Eyes) and a young, energetic activist Dakota, Two Stars.

I enjoyed the victories after families had been torn apart by different loyalties and how they came to grips with them.<br /> This particular book deals with a widower trying to cope with a farm alone - and her young son, Gideon.  It chronicles the divided home of the wealthy cousin of Emily Lodge.  She postpones her own move to safety and happiness to help the slave owner-cousin even though she opposes his beliefs.  In this capacity, she is allowed to teach illiterate children to read.<br /> Slaves escape, soldiers are wounded and running.  Families are split up while others try to stay emotionally together while physically apart. Faith in God and love of family are tested because of the opposite beliefs of both sides of the war. <br />There is a lot of sadness, suspense and danger involved in the story telling and I believe children age 10 - 12 would get a pretty clear and acurate picture of family life during the Civil War. It causes the reader to want to read the entire series.	2001-02-18

In the meantime, he  meets two different sets of rowdy gang members, or so they seem.  In addition, he pitches his tent right beside a drunken father with a starving family.

Granted, they felt a call of God on their lives, but they seemed to turn a corner somewhere along the route and money became a god instead of God.  At least that's how Jim describes their life in this book.<br />Although the book is long and sometimes wordy, it really does lay out the past and present situation of a man who, once acknowledged as a shining star in the Assemblies of God - failed.  His deep devotion to his wife Tammy Faye is obvious as is his sense of betrayal by her with his trusted best friend.  Of course, he also seemed to understand her needs and the fact that he was in prison and she was lonely.  Still, his account made me very angry at Tammy Faye for not &quot;standing by her man&quot; -per Tammy Wynette.  <br />The prison routine was frightful and probably Jim's sanity was often on the edge, but when he sincerely and seriously turned to God and the Bible, he found that his real friends were there  for him.  Not the &quot;Job's&quot; friends like in that saga, but his real, true friends literally bridged the gap between despair and decency.  I appreciated the fact that Jim gave credit where it was due.<br />Probably the most impressive page of the book was when Jim Bakker said he really, never, ever knew God as deeply as he met Him within the walls of prison, after being stripped of all his glory, money, his marriage and reputation.  It had to be humiliating and embarrassing, but it was probably at that low point in his life when he realized all the expensive trappings and phoney friends were just transitory, and all that was real was his faith and dependence on God.  He realized he was wrong, he repented and cameback, just as he was, and God met him there.<br />I feel writing this book was perhaps the cleansing ritual Jim needed to go through before being released, and I think it was much like his personal journaling only he shared it with the public.  Thanks Jim, and may God bless your new ministry however humble.	2001-01-07

Told through the journal of 12 yr. old Becca, the book is written in mountain jargon, warm, friendly, the kind that makes the reader want to drop in and sit a spell with them.  After the loss of their MOm to consumption (probably TB), the children continue on living, attempting to make Papa laugh.  This is what they feel their mother wants them to do.  However, Papa is not in the mood for laughing, in fact, suicide is more on his mind.  His fiddle has been silent, his social contacts nonexistent.  The Christmas part is touching, when the children attempt to have a Christmas and papa rages that it will not happen.  I was happy to see this made into a movie for TV as well, but of course, it is more touching to read the book.	2001-01-03

Even though I am a fan of Focus on the Family, and Mike Trout was the co-host of the broadcast when I read this book, I found it did not hold my attention.  His descriptions of the places he stopped could have been enlarged, as well as the people he met and the sights he saw.  He was accompanied by his son in law, and planned the coast to coast route which was not necessarily the easiest, but one which passed through Colorado, home of Focus on the Family.<br />I agree that this could have been a full length magazine article instead of a book and certainly I would encourage readers to borrow it or check it out of the library.  It is not a keeper in my opinion.  Sorry Mike, I liked you as co-host, but as author, well, you are just so so.	2001-01-03

Lorabeth fled from an arranged marriage in England, only to arrive at the Virginia home of a grandmother she had never met. She was a total stranger due to the scandalous elopement of her mother some 20 years prior.  Hoping to become a member of a &quot;real&quot; family, instead she falls helplessly and hopelessly in love with her first cousin, Cameron Montrose whom she had never known.  The entire book revolves primarily around their complicated, clandestine romance which continues even after both of them are betrothed to another person.  <br />If there is one surprise that Peart is able to pull off, it is when Lorabeth's mother is invited to Virginia to attend her wedding to the son of a wealthy family, hence - two famous Virginia families united by a marriage. The results are a nice, surprising twist.<br />Since this was my first Jane Peart book, I started with a blank slate...and sincerely hope this is not her best work - it contained way too much romance, and way too little history and Christian influence.  However, in fairness to Peart, I will definitely try another book or two before forming a lasting opinion.	2000-11-04

Both are forced to relocate miles away from the parents they love and the family life they miss.<br />This book parallels the lives of these two young people.  For Henry, the memory of an earlier encounter with a young widow haunts him day and night...until he runs into her again in a most unusual circumstance. The girl re-enters his life under an alias. In spite of her constantly ignoring him, Henry is consumed with protecting her and becoming a father figure to her 5 yr. old son, Danny.<br />Christine, 18, is taking her first job and while living in one room at a boarding house receives an offer from her wealthy boss.  He wants her to come live in his expensive, large home in exchange for cooking his dinners.  She declines, but in the process meets her boss's son, Boyd.  Boyd is a spoiled, wild, lazy, drinking, university student with a completely different set of values from Christine's.  They eventually do become engaged, which holds the reader on pins and needles.<br />This book deals with family issues of the day, apparently just before a great war is to start.  It takes place in Canada, and seems to be set just before WWI. Family trust and values are stressed, along with the empty nest of Elizabeth and Wynn.  Strengths of this book are the religious and family values carried on by both grown adopted children.<br />I found it rather unusual for Oke to introduce for the first time, issues which deal with total control and spousal abuse, but she did so in a well-controlled way.  Of extreme importance all through this book is family loyalty, family values and family devotion.<br />Per Oke, this is another book which holds ones attention and cries for a sequel.	2000-09-23

Beverly Lewis is one of my favorite writers, but this time, she failed to  have enought story line to fill a whole book!<br />Sarah Cain, 28, is a  successful real estate broker living in Portland, Oregon.  She is  financially well off, but suffers from an unresolved guilt from a past  accident which killed a little girl. She is evading, and running from her  chance of happiness with Bryan.<br />Sarah has long been partially estranged  from her only sister, 34 yr. old Ivy.  Therefore, when widowed Ivy dies  unexpectedly, Sarah is shocked that her will names Sarah as guardian for  the five orphaned minor children.<br />Ivy's family is Amish, living on a  large farm in Lancaster County, PA.  Heavily featured in this book is the  oldest child, 16 yr. old Lydia.  Disciplined, dutiful and sensitive, Lydia  fills in as mother until Sarah can arrive. She is biding her time until she  can marry Levi King.<br />Sarah's selfish independence and her love of wealth  and its' trappings conflict with the simple, Amish lifestyle of her nephews  and nieces.  Therefore, she sets about to solve her uncomfortable new  status quickly by flying to Lancaster for one week, during which time she  is determined to find a nice Amish home for the children.<br />Obviously,  Beverly Lewis has a future for this fractured family, and the ending is all  too abrupt and predictable, not at all like her 3 book Shunning series.   That, in particular is why I gave the book only 2 stars.  The material is  great and it was interesting, but there was not nearly enough to fill a  complete book and I was disappointed with its' lack of depth.	2000-08-26

She longs to know about her  real mother and her own homeland roots.  Liz's mother and father were  shunned for leaving the Amish and there was little to no continuation of  her heritage.     Consequently, her father arranges for her to spend the  summer with his mother who still is Amish and runs Zook's Nook. <br />During  the trip back home to Pennsylvania, memories surface and father and  daughter re-live their beginnings as a family, before the untimely death of  Lizzie's mother in a car wreck when Liz was but an infant.  Their first  stop was a cafe which played a huge part in her parent's lives.  Then there  came a trip to see the &quot;little pink house&quot; which was gone.   Despondent, they searched, found and purchased the gingerbread-porch and  lightening rods.<br />When Liz ends up staying part of the summer with her  Amish grandmother, she learns those people are very hard workers with  precious little  fun or freedom. They work hard for long hours 6 days a  week.  Discovering a telephone hidden safely for years in her grandmother's  hay barn, Liz learns that even Amish elders (and kids) have skeletons in  their closets and have to make amends for past wrongs.<br />As Liz spends time  in the attic searching for her past, she finds articles and asks questions  which lead her closer to her deceased mother.  She eventually is privy to  pictures and letters. Finally, her dad comes back and takes her on a little  pilgrimage to the church where her parents were married and her mother's  funeral was held.  The church has been turned into a tourist shop.<br />After  staying with her grandmother only three weeks, Liz gradually becomes aware  of what is important and whom she can trust and love.

This second book in the LaHaye-Blackstock series continues the lives of the four families who live in the Smoky Mountains of TN.  However, the senior couple, Sylvia and Harry are now serving as medical missionaries in  Nicaragua.   A hurricane and horrible mudslide season has presented them  with unspeakable death and destruction, and the addition of a baby which  Sylvia longs to nurture permanently as her own.  <br />The Dodds, Brenda and  David are in the background, trying to recover financially from the  so-far-successful heart transplant of their young son.  Brenda returns to  homeschooling and includes Mark, a neighbor boy who is in trouble.<br />Dr.  Cathy Flaherty is a single mother of three teenagers and is  attempting to  survive the turbulent adolescence of 13 yr. old Mark.  She is also  experiencing a serious dating season with widower Steve and his daughter,  Amanda.<br />The heart of this book centers on Barry and Tory Sullivan and the  news that they are expecting child number three and the subsequent  revelation that this child is a Downs Syndrome baby.  Staunchly pro-life  until this news, Barry is certain he wants to abort this child to, as he  puts it, save the child from a life it will hate, and us from a life we  won't survive. He is speaking from his pain as the brother of  severely  handicapped, autistic, Nathan.   His comments come from his heart and his  gut, and are meant to be his personal way to solve everything for himself  and his family. Tory, who up to this point had to have every detail of her  life perfect and in order, is determined to carry this disabled child to  term.  Barry tries to force his choice of abortion and Tory resents him and  his horrible solution to their dilemma.  Their marriage falters as Barry  seeks comfort in a female coworker and Tory reels from the revelation that  her husband is not the man she thought he was.<br />The outcome of these  families' heartaches and triumphs all comes together to make this secondbook a must read for fans of contemporary Christian fiction, as well as for  families and friends who know someone with a handicapped child.  It is well  written with feelings, worries and concerns all spelled out precisely but  handled professionally, gently, and Biblically. <br />Thank you Beverly LaHaye  and Terri Blackstock for tackling this explosive topic in a thorough and  yet compassionate manner.	2000-07-26

I decided to read this book simply because it introduces book two in the series which I was especially interested in!  However, I became interested as I met the four families who live in an upper middle class cul-de-sac in  eastern Tennessee.  They are in various seasons in their lives.  <br />The  Dodds are a family with four children who are home-schooled and both  parents  stay and work at home full time.  Although they seem to be the  ideal, all American family, there are problems.  She is a believer in God,  he is not, due to emotional trauma he suffered as a child.  At the heart of  this book is the sudden illness of their 9 yr. old son.  He ends up in the  hospital awaiting a heart transplant and his Mom and Dad differ on how to  best help him.<br />The Sullivans are a couple with two preschoolers in a  family which consists of a hard working husband and a slim, fit, rather  obsessive, frustrated writer-wife.  She has  read so many self-help books  she is phobic.  She keeps an impeccably clean house, but she hates her role  as a stay at home, unfulfilled wife and mother. The last straw was when she  SAW a bestseller book on the library shelf that contained the same plot as  the book she was currently writing!  In anger she destroyed her manuscript  and declared she was finished with writing - forever.<br />The Flaherty family  is headed by  a single Mom who is a veterinarian.  She has her hands full  with three active, older kids, and a chip on her shoulder because she was  dumped for a younger woman. Dating is completely awkward to her and she  wonders if it is really worth it and feels like forgetting it.  She has  problems with the school's sex education classes and is willing to fight  all the way to the school board. She is particularly upset with her  inability to reach and control her 15 yr. old terribly rebellious  daughter.<br />The Bryans are an older Christian couple whose children have  all moved out.  She is lonely and feels useless, he is a cardiac surgeon  with a consuming call on his heart to missions. These two are a sort of  surrogate Mom and Dad to the other couples in their area.<br />The book blends  the lives of these four families in quite a remarkable way.  While each  family's life is intertwined and each has their own crises, the thing that  pulls them together for a common purpose is the life threatening situation  with 9 yr. old Joseph Dodd.  Heart transplants aren't cheap, and even with  insurance paying part of the bill, the Dodd family is staring at up to  $35,000 out of pocket.  They put their house up for sale. Not wanting to  lose their good neighbors, the other families on the cul-de-sac work to  raise the needed funds. This, along with the illness, changes their lives  forever.<br />The saddest part of the book is when young Joseph goes into a  coma just before he is given up for dead.  No heart has been found, and he  cannot last more that a few hours at the most.  It is a dark, emotional and  frightening night at the hospital.  But, what eventually happens to the  child is a surprise which makes the book worth the read.  Changes occur in  all the families, and decisions are cemented which will change their lives  forever. <br />This is a contemporary, Christian fiction book about four  families that could live in Any City, USA, and I recommend it highly.	2000-07-12

These two folks were first introduced to Oke's readers around  20 yrs. ago as a young, lonely  couple-to-be in her very first book of the   best-selling series, &quot;Love Comes Softly&quot;.  <br />Even though Loves  Comes Softly officially ended with &quot;Love Finds a Home&quot;,  the same  family is picked up several years later when A Prairie Legacy was born.  It  is this four book series which is ending with &quot;Like Gold  Refined.&quot;  For this reason, I was both terribly excited and a bit  hesitant to pick up the book, possibly ending forever the long, warm,  family type relationship with a much loved family. <br />Oke did a superb job  of filling in several years  between series and Virginia is a central  character of this last 4 book group.  She is the daughter of the Davis'  daughter, Belinda Simpson, so she is their granddaughter.<br />Now married and  mother of four, Virginia lives with her husband Jonathan on a horse ranch  near her extended family.  Their oldest child, Mindy is  adopted...unofficially.  She was the baby of Virginia's dear friend,  misguided and foolish Jenny, who simply decided her child would be in her  way and would have a much better life with Virginia and Jonathan. So, as a  fragile, neglected, unwanted three year old, she sort of  &quot;defaulted&quot; to become the first child of then newlyweds Virginia  and Jonathan Lewis.  Mindy is around eight years old when this book  opens.<br />Virginia is having great difficulty accepting what age and time do  to older folks.  Her grandparents have always been a spiritual and  emotional stronghold for her, and when she sees her mother, Belinda is very  worried for their safety and independence, Virginia decides to refute this  possibility by visiting herself. What she finds out is both shocking and  heartbreaking to her.<br />Little Mindy has not heard from her biological  mother, Jenny, in many years.  Virginia is both happy and sad.  She is  nervous and worried.  What IF Jenny does come back?  What IF? She is  positive that she and Jonathan could never, ever give up their beloved  oldest child. Therefore, she is startled when Mindy brings up the question,  &quot;Did my other mommy love me&quot; to which no honest answer will be  comforting. <br />As Marty and Clark continue to deteriorate, finding suitable  help for them is central in the life of Belinda.  The coming of the  telephone makes communication much easier, but something more needs to be  done to protect her precious parents.<br />At the heart of this book is an  unexpected letter and visit from Jenny.  Not only is she very, very ill  with cancer, she drops the proverbial bomb on Virginia by stating she is  taking HER daughter home with her.  Pandemonium sets in for Virginia, but  Jonathan is much calmer and determined, and the next day announces to Jenny  that she is NOT taking Mindy away.  Cursing, yelling, screaming,  threatening, Jenny leaves for home without the daughter who doesn't even  know her mother, or frankly, even care. Will legal negotiations become  necessary?  Jonathan is prepared to go all the way, no matter what it costs  them.<br />It costs them dearly.  They are able to survive the first round of  court and attorney costs which gave them their wishes....Mindy stays with  them.  But, the cost has been dear, and they are forced to pare down and  postpone their dreams.  But they have the most important thing, their  daughter.  Or, do they?<br />Another letter, another court fight.  This one is  sure to bankrupt this little family.  But in the middle of this second  battle, little Mindy drops a bomb of her own.  Ten years old and sensitive,  she walks into the room, overhearing a conversation so carefully kept from  her in the past.  Learning that her mama wants her (needs her?), she begins  to feel she must go live with her. She must tell her about God before she  dies. Devastated but honest, Jonathan and Virginia try to start the  adjustment of life without their much loved oldest child. <br />The  conclusions of this book, the outcome of Mindy's life, Jenny's life,  Virginia and Jonathan's life, and the finale for Clark and Marty Davis  makes this a must read wrap -up for these dear, dear friends if only in the  pages of a book.  Thank you Janette Oke for years of pleasure from and  fellowship with a great, great family.  Rarely has such a family impacted  so great a reading audience.	2000-07-08

The storyline was conceived forty years earlier by  the author, but for some reason she didn't explain, it never made it to  print until 1995.  <br />Ariana was an orphan, adopted by loving parents and  the one and only link she had to her biological parents was her wedding  dress.  However, all her hopes of being married in this dress, and teaching  plans were changed during her horrible, violent kidnapping by two rowdy  men.<br />While she was held hostage in a camp controlled by bandits, her  faith and trust were severely tested. She had to hold fast to God and her  trust that He would control her destiny even when it seemed the rowdy  outlaws were in charge of her life and future.<br />The exciting (and  surprising) conclusion to this book makes it among the top of the bunch.  I  plan to read it again and again. Thank you, Janette Oke, for finally  putting this story in print!	2000-06-26

I listened to the recorded, three cassette version and really think I missed some of the depth of Robert Peck's childhood-based story. I heard  the re-recorded version narrated by Johnny Heller.<br />Shakers in Vermont  must have been quite a peculiar people, and young Robert showed extreme  gratitude and happiness when a neighbor gave him his first real gift, a  tiny piglet he named Pinky. Robert's father was a butcher and made his  living from pigs. At first the father would not allow Robert to accept the  gift until it was given as advance pay against labor promised in the  future.<br />Life was tough and Robert worked very hard on the farm. His  parents' strict Shaker faith would not  allow for idleness or waste.  Therefore, it was a very big task to expect this young lad to take a  neighbor's cow to the fair and show the cow in spite of the fact he wanted  to show his  own pig. He made good choices -- most of the time.<br />In spite  of the incredible sadness at the end of this book,  Robert's heroic act of  saving a cow and her calf by pulling a goiter from the cow's throat with  his bare hand puts this book on a must-read list for children over 10 (due  to occasional profanity and gory descriptions of life on the farm).<br />The  book leads to many possible avenues for lively discussion for  children....family life, responsibilities and friendships.  Animal care and  appreciation are stressed as important. <br />Probably the most important  aspect for discussion is what to do when your family is apt to go hungry  and your very best friend is your pet pig which would feed your family.   <br />A great springboard for imaginations and young people exchanging ideas!	2000-06-26
US	52900384	R2I1C1JDEPU0JW	0394769104	292610258	The Courage of Sarah Noble	Books	4	16	18	N	N	Definitely a good choice for children to listen to!	I decided to compare listening -- to reading -- a book.  I very much enjoyed the smooth, expressive voice of narrator, Barbara Caruso.  <br />Around 1700, little 8 yr. old Sarah left her mother and siblings to  accompany her father to the wilderness of Connecticut to build their new  home.  Only a child, her job was to cook. When she was scared, she  remembered her mother's parting words, &quot;Keep up your courage, Sarah  Noble&quot;. <br />Of all the things Sarah was afraid of, the Indians scared  her the most.  She and her father spent one night of their travels in a  home in which the boys teased and worried her needlessly about the Indians.  When Sarah and her father arrived at their property, Indian children  quickly became her friends and put Sarah at ease.  <br />The two adult Indians  who befriended the family, Tall John and his wife Mary ended up taking care  of Sarah when her father returned for the rest of the family.<br />This little  book carefully explains Mary's need to dress Sarah like the other Indian  children, complete with soft moccasins.  Sarah refused to give up her  moccasins much to the disdain of her newly arriving mother. <br />This  cassette is about one hour long, just right for listening by children 5-8,  perhaps divided into 2 or 3 segments.  It also lends itself to discussion  about Colonial life in America, as well as the diversity of cultures.<br />  Friendship, trust, loyalty and respect are high priorities of this author,  Alice Dalgliesh. I would certainly recommend this little book for its'  content as well as historical value since it is based on a true story.	2000-06-26

Isaac, 12, is recuperating in the home of an Amish family in Pennsylvania Dutch country early in the 1900's.  His Jewish background conflicts seriously with that of his Amish hosts. Of particular problem is diet, and  observation of the Sabbath.  He quickly learns of the conflict between 16  yr. old Gideon and his father. <br />Both young men struggle with the  regulations and restrictions of their respective families.  Gideon,  however, is determinded to follow his dream of reading and playing music.   This will mean he has to leave his family and his beloved sister, Annie.  Annie seems to be a central character in this book, both for Gideon and for  Isaac.  She shows incredible insight and compassion. <br />This book deals  with family conflict, religious traditions and the interactions of youth  from different cultures. It might be more appropriate for the older child,  since it does deal with some serious rejecting of the beliefs of the  parents and needs to be discussed within a safe and informative environment  such as the home first.	2000-06-13

Probably the most intriguing part of the book is the revelation of the  identity of blond, handsome, actor Grayson Chandler, the heartthrob of  Nora. It is interesting to renew old friends Mikal and Karyn Ritter and  others from Karyn's Memory Box, but somehow, the story does not flow as  well.

The original &quot;Dare to Discipline&quot; was great for parents, and the new one is even better.  Dr. Dobson carefully explains the needs that are most important to kids and their parents.  He lays out his belief, complete  with scripture references.  While it is obvious that child abuse has  increased, the need to correctly discipline children has increased even  more.  James Dobson shows how teaching and training must be loving yet  strict enough to sometimes be called old fashioned.  This is a must-read  for all newlyweds and especially new parents.  It is as relevant now as it  was when I first read it several years ago.	2000-05-18

Jessie King is dead, LisBeth her daughter has just lost her husband in the Indian war, and now she seeks some meaning to life.  In mourning, she finds she is too bitter to accept the faith of her mother.  Soaring Eagle is fighting a battle of the cultures.  He is an Indian who is forced to act like a white man.  He refuses their God.  Jim Callaway is a career soldier who had seen and done such horrendous things that he deserts the army, running, and ends up in Lincoln, Nebraska near LisBeth and smithy, Joseph.  David Braddock is introduced in this book and as rich as he is, he cannot convince LisBeth to end her mourning and court him.  So many changes in the town's people occur, the most outstanding being when the daughter of the town gossip accepts the call to an Indian mission school.  There she meets Soaring Eagle and Carrie, a little white girl who is the only one who can reach into the heart and soul of Soaring Eagle.  Soaring Eagle wears the gold cross which Jessie, his dead white stepmother wore, and a locket with the pictures of his mother and an unidentified woman...his sister whom he has never seen?  LizBeth has nightmares about an Indian riding the plains with HER husband's locket around his neck.

On the  way he found a dead family with a newborn boy which the mother handed up to  him, begging him to raise her son for the Lord...then she died.  Now Elijah  Book is a single, rough-hewn, newly changed preacher with an  infant....which he knows absolutely nothing about caring for.  A traveling  show comes to Hope, bringing a young, educated woman who is running from an  abusive, wealthy, musically inclined father.  She has just lost a newborn  herself, so she agrees to nurse the preacher's baby for a fee.  The  &quot;storm&quot; occurs in the town when a tornado nearly wipes them out,  and there is also a &quot;storm&quot; within the preacher and the young  singing woman on the run.

As Rosie and Seth Hunter begin their married life, the town of Hope flourishes.  The mercantile and post office are now run by Caitrin Murphy, sister of Mrs. O'toole, and the focus shifts.  Jack, the bully and the  outlaw of book one, is attempting to escape town after being shot in the  shoulder.  He hides in a barn and encounters red-headed Caitrin for the  first time.  Both are firey, opinionated, mouthy and fiesty.  The highlight  of this book for me was when Jack learns that God loves him and he is so  humbled by that realization. When he heals, he tries to return to Hope,  start anew and make peace.  The people of Hope do not intend to make peace  with the likes of Jack, and bigotry and prejudice especially in Jack's  mother and Caitrin's brother in law keeps the town in an uproar....mostly  against Jack.  He has brought with him his sister, Lucy, who seems like a  mad woman.  She cannot relate to normal people...but no one except Caitrin  makes any attempt to reach her.  Lucy's family's dark, ugly secret is kept  for only the 3 of them to ever know.  It is not until Jack is actually  threatened himself that Lucy has to decide whether or not to break her  silence, admit to her dark past and save her brother.  The author does a  superb job in identifying the ugly and mean side of some of the  townspeople, and the good and the gentle side of others.  She manages to  elicit fear, anger, sympathy, hope, despair and excitement in the reader.   Familes are divided, loyalties are questioned, love seems destined to die  and the town struggles to stay alive in the drought. The reader is left to  wonder whether the real &quot;Fire&quot; is the prairie fire, or the fire  of hate and dissention which burns out of control several times in the  book.  I could hardly put the book down, and I am sooooooo anxious for  &quot;Prairie Storm&quot; to be released!	1998-11-07

I tried so many places to obtain this book which apparently was out of print, but finally was able to buy one through the mail.  It was certainly worth waiting for!  Lizzie has already lost one husband to an accident, and her second husband has suffered severe brain damage and now has the mind of a child.

I found this book to definitely be Feldhake's best of this series so far, and I am now reading book 5.	1998-06-24

Rosie did not mind the orphanage so much, but she missed having a home to call her own.  However, the methodology she chose to find it was quite outlandish in her day.....that of simply declaring herself an employee and jumping on a wagon heading to the Kansas prairie.

I am an avid reader and lover of Amish history.  These 2 passions drew me to a display containing &quot;The Shunning&quot; when we were traveling and stopped to eat at a little restaurant-gift shop.  I just had to get up from my meal and take a look at the book.  I was so interested I had to read it.  The characters were exciting people, individual in spite of being identical!  Katie especially intrigued me!  She was so fiesty, so different, opinionated, yet family oriented.  How could she expect to be happy at any one place when the whole world called to her?  I felt empathy for Katie's Amish parents because having a daughter like her surely was a test in their community!  Yet, I felt Katie's pain...her uncertainty...her desires...what part in her longterm future would Mary play?  How could Katie endure without Dan, her soul mate?  How could she marry a man she did not love?  Why must she be forced to live without the beautiful, soothing music she adored?  Was it sin, or simply protocol?  It was easy to keep switching my loyalty from one group to the other...they all had some good ideas. I thought I understood Katie and her inquisitive nature, yet I wanted to scold her for being ungrateful and even spiteful to her parents at times. I seemed to have love-hate for one person, then another!  I think this author, Bev Lewis, surely must have an interesting life....how else could she think of so many wonderfully surprising events?  For a book that led one to think it was going to be about a fairly dull family, living in a fairly dull town, with fairly dull ideals, there certainly was a trememdous amount of excitement nontheless! People DID have feelings, they DID experience emotions, and Katie Lapp was determined to live them in addition to just feeling them!  There are issues here that are presented so well, love and marriage, family life, faith, obedience to parents, loyalty, adoption, trust, life and death, grief and mourning, traditions, ways of life...and all of these are wrapped around one tiny, pink satin baby gown!  When I saw I was on the last page, I was stricken....NO, THIS CANNOT BE ENDING...there is so much I do not know yet!  What will happen to..what if...when will...why didn't....maybe they...if only....      I did not rest a moment until book number 2 was in my hands! I so fully appreciate the author's portrayal of the love of God, His plan of salvation and especially the individuality of each person in spite of their surroundings!  Thanks, Bev!	1998-01-23

I was not disappointed!  There WAS more, indeed, in this second book!  Wow!  For the first time in all my reading days, I found it completely impossible to resist frantically searching through the pages to be sure this or that did, in fact, happen...things just could NOT go on as they were...I could not wait to find out by reading a page at a time...I had to frantically search the pages until I knew... The continuation of the story of Katherine, Laura, her Amish family, Mary, and the wise old woman...and the bishop...and her true love...this story took so many strange turns and curves, it was impossible to second guess the author.  Suspense ruled!  Bev Lewis never let me wander from the story line....how could I?  I practically read the book straight through!  It was just glued to my hands and would NOT go down until I was done.  Book #3?    PLEEEEEZE!!	1998-01-23
