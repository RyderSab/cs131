On par with the books previously mentioned, Winter is an engrossing study of a man and his society.  The story focuses on a middle-aged man and his family, a family that used to have much greater financial and social status.  He is an honorable and philosophical man, who must wrestle with the loss of status and the obvious hypocrisy he sees around him.  We watch his character gradually change as he questions himself, planning acts and then questioning them.  We see as highly charged an emotional moment as Steinbeck ever wrote when, during a confrontation, our hero informs his adversary that \\"You'll feel better, sir, when you have got used to the fact that I am not a pleasant fool.\\" His children show the two possibilities for America moving forward.  This book is worth serious study.	2005-08-06

There are some who would like to call TR a racist or imperialist or some other catchphrase.  In The Letters and Lessons of Theodore Roosevelt for his Sons, however, you must get to know the person.  Even if you don't agree with everything he did historically, you come away with a sense of who the person was and what his priorities, personality, and sense of honor and responsibility were all about.  I don't claim to be unbiased, being a great admirer of the man.  The letters only reaffirmed what I believed and made me respect the man all the more.  The only minor thing that annoyed me about the book was the editor's mention in the foreword about the \\"Christian\\" character of Roosevelt's stances.  Those concepts belong to all people of honor, and are not attached to any given religious tradition.	2005-04-11

Morris' \\"Rise\\" will give background prior to the Presidency.  I hope a third volume will follow to describe TR's life after the White House.  It would be impossible to give all the background some reviewers seem to desire.  TR's relationship with his family would require an enormous volume itself.  For an in-depth treatment of the events of TR's presidency, however, this is an excellent book.  The major events, and TR's role and opinions, are all described in great detail, from the famous/infamous events leading up to the Panama Canal, the tragic events in Texas, the resolution of the coal strikes, \\"Trust Busting,\\" the Russo-Japanese war, his conservation efforts, and the Great White Fleet.  A truly fitting tribute to \\"The Strenuous Life\\" made real in the White House.  The author obviously truly admires his subject, but does not hide perceived flaws or failings.	2004-12-11

Some might question why such a book is needed.  After all, the Da Vinci Code was meant to be fiction.  Are we just beating up on a fiction author who takes \\"poetic license\\" with history?  Few people were particularly concerned that some of the charcters in \\"Braveheart\\" actually lived years apart.  In the case of the Da Vinci Code, though, it is necessary.  The popularity of the Da Vinci Code or The Passion of Christ (ironically, another Mel Gibson project), make these works more than mere pieces of fiction.  Such a calm consideration of actual history should be required reading for anyone who will base their religious opinions upon the fictional works.  While we're at it, someone also please send copies of all Dr. Ehrman's work to Mr. Gibson.	2004-11-16

As we saw in Lamb, though, Moore intermixes telling social commentary and genuine warmth into the humor. The books may be funny, but they're not frivolous. In Lust Lizard, Moore scores again with his signature style. The psychiatric establishment takes a few hits here, as does the pharmacy industry. Theo and the B Movie Queen are two of Moore's more endearing characters, making for a fun read that isn't fluff. Give this as a gift proudly.	2004-11-01

For me, the most important part of this book is the way in which the authors show how wild claims for untested treatments should be analyzed.  Too much pseudoscience pretends to be real science, and parents waste time and money that could be spent on proven treatments.  An essential book for everyone involved with AD(H)D.	2004-09-13

The education review process is often far from rational, and sometimes far from fair.  Parents who don't know what their rights are, and what their CHILD'S rights are, may not be able to advocate for educational programming that maximizes their child's potential.  This book shows parents how to be assertive, without being aggressive and making the process emotionally antagonistic on either side.  This book is an exceptional guide to highly specicialized knowledge, knowledge you may not be able to come by any other way.

Procedures for making the drinks are nicely spelled out, as well as information on glassware and tools, etc.  Alternate recipes are shown for several drinks, showing that there is not just ONE WAY to make certain drinks.  This lack of arrogance shows through in a number of ways, including in the sidebars on the pages that highlight particular spirits.  Lots of interesting background there.  I especially enjoyed the features on the Dekuyper's cordials.  They may offend the snobs, but they're fun!  Another great feature is an index by ingredient.  You get a new bottle of something and can look it up to see what new drinks you can make with what you have on hand.  In general, this book is fun and informative and is a must-have for any drink mixer.	2004-08-20

He rightly points out that history has been written by the winners (the &quot;proto orthodox&quot;).  The version of history that came to us suggested that the proto orthodox were ALWAYS the orthodox, and all others were heretics.  This book goes into great detail, demonstrating that this simple notion was indeed false.  Thriving communities were based upon &quot;other&quot; gospels and letters, and some found Paul's version of Christianity to be the REAL heresy.  I would also highly recommend Dr. Ehrman's course from The Teaching Company on this topic.  He is an engaging lecturer as well as excellent scholar.	2004-06-27

Wells struggled with the issue of \\"what man can make of man\\" in the course of his many novels and other writings.  In The Undying Fire, Wells give us an updated Book of Job, focusing on the tribulations of an actual descendant of the biblical Job.  The various characters from the Biblical narrative are all there, in updated (circa World War One) form.  This allows Wells the freedom to move around and speak from different perspectives and to explore the issue of humanity and its relation to the deity.  This is a generally optimistic treatment, but the hints of Wells' eventual frustration are evident as well.  A very well-written book.	2004-06-21

The description is entirely accurate.  Lamb, by Christopher Moore, deals with a topic many other authors have addressed:  the &quot;missing years&quot; between birth and age 30 for Jesus of Nazareth.  This particular tale, however, is told from the perspective of a &quot;regular guy&quot; friend of the future messiah.  It is laugh out loud funny at times, touching at others (perhaps unintentionally touching?).  Young Joshua is shown as very human, struggling with doubt and how to go about being the messiah he has been told he will be.  Bible characters such as Mary and Joseph and Mary Magdalene and John the Baptist make appearances, again as very human characters struggling with real issues.  This is one that I lend out often.  If I get it back at all, it's from people who are buying their own copies to lend to others.  It will offend only the most sensitive who cannot deal with the idea of the humanity of Jesus.	2004-01-29

Why, in America, are celebrities given such attention in public matters?  You sing?  That's nice, but why should I then particularly care what your political views are?

Dr. Young gives us a description of a society that abolishes priority based on family lines, and instead is based on intellectual achievement. He warns us against the excesses of such a system, but he does it an interesting way that treads dangerous ground. His narrator is firmly in support of the meritocracy system, and is given great eloquence by the author. Much as Aldous Huxley did in Brave New World, the system he seeks to question is championed by a very effective communicator. Some readers may not realize that Young was NOT an ardent supporter of the meritocracy idea, such is the eloquence of the narrator in its support. An interesting book that contributes greatly to the discussion, both pro and con.  The final lines were beneath the rest of the book.  A fiction writer can always make his point by having the characters behave in keeping with his theory.  The philosophy was much better.	2003-07-29

In this book, she outlines several of the main reasons behind this theory.  These include bipedalism, loss of body hair, fat storage, and similar physiological features that suggest that the Savannah theory leaves too much unexplained to simply be accepted.  This, I think, is the key to the book and to Morgan's other work.  She is championing Hardy's idea, and asking us simply not to accept the Savannah theory as unquestionably correct.  Her arguments are logical and coherent.  The theory is no more \\"untestable\\" than any other theory in evolution.

Harry Houdini and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle both possessed keen intellects, but found themselves on opposite sides of the spiritualism debate.  Relying extensively on the actual correspondence of the two men, Polidoro traces their history and interactions to the unhappy, but perhaps inevitable, conclusion.  Although clearly (and appropriately) a skeptic, Polidoro resists the urge many authors cannot to make fun of individuals like Doyle.<br />The sad moral of the story is that intelligence is not enough.  A mind capable of creating characters and stories such as those that featured Sherlock Holmes and Professor Challenger could not see the simple ways in which he was being duped.  The methods of the spiritualists are the methods of the magicians, and no training in physics or the other branches of natural science teaches you those tricks.  If anything, such training may make you easier to fool, as experimental apparatus does not consciously lie and you are trained to trust what you see.  Mercifully, Polidoro does not dwell on such topics as the fairy photographs that fooled Doyle, although they are mentioned.<br />The book held the interest all the way through, and one emerges with a much deeper appreciation of Houdini in particular, who inevitably comes across as the champion of experimental control, and therefore as the subtle winner of the debate.	2002-12-26

Rather than being tied to a particular theoretical system, he encourages an empirical approach that actually looks at the research literature to see what is effective.  Go figure!  This book shows multimodal therapy in action, which is easier for many people to understand than the more theoretical writings.  Dr. Lazarus was an inspiration to me in my early training as a behavior therapist, and this book was one of the best.	2002-02-23

She knew how to construct and tear down arguments with a logician's thoroughness.  In addition, her thinking went &quot;outside the box&quot; of standard psychoanalysis.  Within this work in particular, one finds the seeds of latter day 3rd force psychology and cognitive therapy.  Truly an under-appreciated figure in psychology.	2002-02-23

Ironically, RGB is one of the topic areas that best addresses the critics of ABA, and yet many within the field do not properly appreciate its importance.  Some of the research conclusions have been updated recently, but this is an excellent place to begin getting grounded in RGB	2002-02-10

In Coercion and its Fallout, he provides the most in-depth discussion yet regarding the unanticipated and unfortunate side effects of the use of aversive stimuli (punishers).  While I might have a bit of a disagreement with him regarding the way punishers are defined (not in terms of the stimuli's effect on behavior), the arguments are persuasive.  This is a must read for anyone designing behavior change procedures.	2002-02-04

The writing is straight-forward and well-organized.  The only thing one could wish for is a second edition, but in the foreword it states they promised their families that there woulnd't be one :)  That's ok, it provides all the groundwork one needs to read and understand the literature since then.  REVIEW EDIT:  Amazon has placed this review, written in 2002 for the first edition, on the page with the second edition.  Other reviews from the first edition, from before the second edition was published, are also here.  That confusion notwithstanding, the second edition is also excellent, and serves as the great update we'd all anticipated.	2002-02-04

Highly recommended.	2002-02-03

She does her homework, and incorporates important historical and philosophical elements.  In Servant of the Bones, she ties together fascinating character studies with a supernatural &quot;mystery thriller&quot; flavor.  Although she is clearly now a media figure, she does not shy away from poking fun at the fascination many people have with celebrities and pop culture.  An intelligent work from an intelligent author.  You won't be able to put it down during the final chapters.	2002-01-05

As before, this family of disorders is addressed straight-on.  The need for empircally-validated treatments is explained and real-life instruction is provided.  The chapter on speech is as good as I've seen.	2001-07-20

Because some authority tells you to, and speaks about reinforcers and punishers.  Nielsen makes us go deeper.  Must all bad people be irrational?  Must all immorality turn upon the agent?  Nielsen takes on these questions head on and leads us into unsettling territory.  This is an excellent book, loaded with intellectual and academic integrity.	2001-03-31

In this work, the editors pull together excellent articles on the nature of cognitive behavior therapy.  In contrast the myth, behavior analysts and therapists do not ignore cognitive material, conscious or nonconscious.  They merely approach it from a more empirical framework and with more parsimonious concepts.  Both adherents of behavior therapy and psychodynamic approaches will get a better understanding ot the two systems with this book.  The &quot;unconscious&quot; is not off-limits for either school, and this book shows how to discuss the issue most intelligently.	2001-02-18

Textbooks tend to repeat the same old stories, many of which are only loosely based on the facts.  This book goes into great depth, and even shows that many famous &quot;cures&quot; were nothing of the sort.  This should be required reading for psychotherapists, and more importantly, for their clients.	2001-02-10

He then generalizes this information to create a theory for paraphilia for the thousands of paraphiles who have no such physical issues.  this is over-generalization at its worst.  this looks like an attempt to define normal only in terms of very conservative concepts of sexuality.  good for historical interest only, but it's not old enough to be history yet.	2001-01-01

This book is both a primer and a warning.  It shows therapists how their eyes must be open and non-judgemental if they are to be of any help at all.  In my private practice, I often lend this book to clients to derive the benefit of its understanding as we mutually explore the behaviors in question.  Sargent's chapter is an absolute gem.	2000-12-11

In the 158 pound marriage, he tells us a story of a special relationship between two couples.  All four characters are developed, and they hold your interest until the end.  The ending seemed a little predictable and I was therefore disappointed, but that unfortunately may be what is required by society's current ideas regarding monogamy.  An excellent read, and a nice conversation starter.	2000-12-11

Drugs are now used for enlightenment (see also Huxley's works Heaven and Hell and The Doors of Perception).  Behavior modification is now for autonomy, not to control.  It is a shame this book does not receive more attention, or even one percent of what its mirror image receives.	2000-12-09

It was an amazing accomplishment and should be a standard in utopian literature. Owing to a personal bias, I would have liked a bit more in-depth analysis of B.F. Skinner and Walden Two. Kumar lacks a behavior analyst's understanding of Skinner, but for this he can be fogiven. Kumar mixes up \\"negative reinforcement\\" with punishment, which is an unfortunate but common mistake with non-behaviorists. He is also very far behind the times in terms of the generalization and maintenance of behavior analytic programming.  Nonetheless, truly an impressive work.	2000-12-09

In this novel, he sets the characters on a course of self-exploration, and an exploration of the whole idea behind the marriage bond.  You may not always agree with Wells, but there is no denying the depth of thinking here.  Deeper issues aside, its a very well-written novel that makes you care about the characters.	2000-12-09

It is well-researched and hard-hitting.  It approaches the  field with a critical eye, and highlights the damage uncritical acceptance  can bring.  The stories of families torn apart are heart-breaking, and the  stories of therapists engaging in fanciful conspiracy theories are  chilling.	2000-08-04
