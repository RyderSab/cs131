It originally was to be a very short story to be included to a preface of George MacDonald's famous faerie story The Golden Key. The story soon began a life of its own, and though altogether brief gives an insightful view into Tolkien's life. <br /> <br />The story is about Smith, who is a normal boy of all accounts. In his village are great feasts, and the Feast of Twenty Four is held. A star, little more than thought a Trinket by the Master Cook, is placed within tie cake, and he eats it unknowing. Then beauty comes upon him, and after he grows up begins to wonder in Faery. This is much the life of Tolkien. Born in South Africa in 1892, he was a little British boy that came to live in England. He became immersed in two things: mythology and language. Soon, so in love with language, he began inventing his own. In the end, he wished to have people speak his languages, to have a history behind it: thus arose Middle-earth. Then, as time went on, just as Smith, Tolkien explored the fantastic worlds, and was accustomed to strange lands. <br /> <br />In the story it is stated he spoke little of it to anyone OUTSIDE of his family. This is also true of Tolkien. Although his (deeply loved) wife was not real involved in his writing, he shared his stories with his family, and it is not to far to say that had it not been for his four children The Lord of the Rings would never have been written. (To understand this statement, one must first realise who The Hobbit was written for. It was written for his children. This, along with Farmer Giles, the other story in this book, Roverandom (newly published), the Father Christmas Letters, and Mr. Bliss, his children's picture book personally illustarted by him. Unwin, his publisher wanted a sequel to The Hobbit, so he began The Lord of the Rings, a much less serious work in the beginning than at last evolved too. So without these we would not have gotten his adult masterpiece). <br /> <br />Then old age approached. Although his mind was not dimmed, his body decided to act like an old body, and not work as well as in his youth. He realised that he was a mortal, and even though he had had a passport to Faery, it did not grant him eternal physical life. Tolkien was sad about this, and wished to finish The Silmarillion. But life is life, and Tolkien knew his life was drawing to an end. Just like his beautiful little people who also knew morality, the hobbits, he died in 1973, 2 September, just shy of dying ten years after his friend C. S. Lewis (who died the same day as Auldous Huxley and JFK). Tolkien, just as Frodo and Biblo, went on the great ships into Paradise, Heaven. He took sick with a gastric ulcer, and developed a chest infection, dying. <br /> <br />Tolkien was of melancholy temperament, and they are notorious for being prone to depression. Tolkien was of the great artistic class, and he knew depression well. It was depression that this story was borne of. In the very last letter in LETTERS OF J. R. R. TOLKIEN, he tells his daughter as something of a P. S. \\"It is stuffy, sticky, and rainy at present - but forecasts are more. favourable\\". As far as my knowledge goes, that is the last thing he wrote, being four days before his death. There is much hope in that statement, even though Tolkien had no way of knowing how much relevance that to that moment in his life. <br /> <br />This is the closest thing of autobiography he has written. This, along with his marvelous short story Leaf by Niggle, are essential of you want to read and understand this Godly man's life. Tree and Leaf, a small book containing the short story aforementioned and his classic essay On Faerie Stories, along with this, will enlighten you greatly on his views of Faerie. These three are essential to understand this man. Leaf By Niggle is him venting his frustration, and then him expressing great hope for hiswork. It also reflects his Catholicism, as Niggle goes thru purgatory. <br /> <br />*This is deduced from LETTERS OF J. R. R. TOLKIEN. In letter 262, Tolkien accepts the invitation to write a preface to The Golden Key, the short story by MacDonald. It was here, in that abandoned preface, that he began Smith, of what was to be a very short story. It had a life of its own, and grew to present length. In letter 270, dated 20 May 1965, Tolkien is talking to Rayner Unwin, his publisher (and as a child reviewed THE HOBBIT for publication, who received, if my memory serves me correctly, ten shillings for reading and writing a little report over it for his father Stanley.) The typescript of this story had been submitted for publication.	2005-07-29
US	50704475	R163BMUIM6TVDH	0060598247	607344832	The Chronicles of Narnia	Books	5	8	9	N	N	A Question of Order: On the Reading of Narnia	For those older readers of Narnia, here are some of my own thoughts on which order to read the Chronicles.  For those new to Narnia, you may be unaware that there are two orders of reading the series; one, chronologically by publication order, and the other by Narnia's internal chronological progression.  The first is is numbered as thus: THE LION, THE WITCH, & THE WARDOBE, PRINCE CASPIAN, VOYAGE OF THE DAWN TREADER, THE SILVER CHAIR, THE HORSE AND HIS BOY, THE MAGICIAN'S NEPHEW, and THE LAST BATTLE.  With this omnibus edition of Narnia, one of fantasy's most popular series has, of course, been ordered as Narnia is now published, with MN as the opening book and LAST BATTLE as the ending book.<br /><br />With two publication orders of Narnia, many people question which to read.  For several reasons, I recommend the first publication order to be read first, the internal chronology second..<br /><br />If one reads the history of Narnia as strictly that, one is much more likely to lose the truths Lewis was trying to impart.  When one reads The Lion, if they had not read Magician's Nephew, they will be unaware of where the Lamp-Post came.  Lion is essential a story about Edmond coming into the salvation of God.  It creates a real sense of wonder, a wonder that would be diluted with knowledge of its creation.  It's a mystery, an account.  You become less concerned with the book in context of the whole series, and more concerned with the book in context of the book.  Some things you might miss or not pay much attention to because you have already taken into account in context of the story's chronology, and not examined what Lewis was trying to say through this.  Also, you get to follow the characters throughout the books, which is lost in the new order.  The four Pevensies are in Books I and II, then only the two younger are in III, along with a new character, a cousin named Eustace.  Then They can no longer go on, and Eustace and Jill Pole is in Book IV.  This is lost in the new order.  Also, you can see Lewis's growth as a writer, getting more and more realistic in characterization as each book was written.  Of course, when he was writing these he was already a phenomenal writer: but this provided room for more growth, and he developed his already great gift even more so.<br /><br />Also, as Paul Ford points out in his excellent Companion to Narnia, the old order is reflective of Biblical history.  God's people are in bondage to the Egyptians, and he frees them.  But the wine and groan, and in the end many die in the wilderness.  Then they go into Babylon, and hear all these creation stories.  After this, they go and record their own history.  Lewis, after trying to write a creation story, found he could not, and went on telling other stories of Narnia.  Only after coming more and more into the spirit of the series, after a good deal of history had been written, could he go back and finish Magician. To quote the preface, Ford says the original order allows \\"the reader to experience something experience something truer than even Lewis intended: the primordial necessity of passing first thru redemption, then into a reinterpretation of one's own story, and finally allowing the future to take its providence course\\".  And how true that is.  How many times can one understand what God is doing in your life until you come to know him?  When you come to the salvation and knowledge of Christ, after some time elapses you can go back and examine your life, and can see where God's hand was on you, guiding you to that place where you met Christ.  And in so doing, you come to trust God in a deeper sense, and as he took care of your past, he will also take care of your future.  Of course, this was not intentional on Lewis's part, but it shows when God gives someone a gift, that person can reach people in such a way as to be totally beyond the person, and directly pointing to God.  This aspect truly points to Jesus Christ and the \\"great Emperor Beyond the Sea,\\".<br /><br />Of course, there is a balance.  They are stories, and should be enjoyed as such.  Through these stories, Lewis gives children and adults alike truth.  However, if you overanalyze them, you are losing the spirit of the series.  One must first enjoy them as stories, and not go dissecting them without reading them simply for stories.  That is why the chronological order also has its merits.  Ironically, however, it is better balanced to read it in original order for reasons cited above, also because you can take each story on its own, appreciating both the story and the symbolism.  Without the interconnecting theme of history behind it, you are forced to look more at what the story is and what it is saying as to what the Chronicles is saying as a whole.  That is one side.  That is not balanced.  Then, go back and read the stories in chronological order.  That makes you appreciate the series as a whole.<br /><br />In conclusion, each has its merits, and without each it they are not balanced.  But for first time readers, read it in the original order.  You will get more out of it.  That is the most balanced way to read and appreciate the stories.  Afterward, go back and read in chronological order.  Then you will have a balanced and complete view of Lewis's fabulous and God-given Chronicles of Narnia.ourse, there is a balance.  They are stories, and should be enjoyed as such.

Tolkien	Books	5	101	103	N	N	A jewel in Tolkien's canon as valuable as a Silmaril	Of the plethora of Tolkien books available on the market, not only is this one of the most essential, it is also one of the most highly enlightening.  Naturally, that's because it was written by Tolkien himself. <br /> <br />Highly illuminating, frequently entertaining, and always interesting, Tolkien's LETTERS give us a remarkable look into one of the 20th century's most popular and widely read authors.  Whether he is talking to his son about marriage, struggling to publish LORT in the early 1950s, addressing fans' various questions and concerns, writing about his scholarly life or his books, Tolkien is sharp-witted, engaging, and extremely intelligent.  To his credit, he never sounds condescending, and ultimately, of all the writing about Tolkien, this is ultimately the most humanizing of them all. <br /> <br />What makes some of the most interesting to the letters are when Tolkien is discussing his own works.  Much like UNFINISHED TALES, the LETTERS are a wonderful sumplement and a great source of information about Middle-earth that cannot be found elsewhere and is incredibly enlightening, whether it be a die-hard Tolkien researcher or a first time reader. <br /> <br />For those familiar with the older editions of LETTERS (I have a hardback version, well before this came out), the newly revised index, prepared by Wayne G. Hammond and Christina Scull, make this alone worth purchasing.  The index is so much better and makes this edition a lot easier to navigate through <br /> <br />What makes Tolkien's LETTERS such a valuable addition to the Tolkien canon is because, of all his books, this is the most intimate, naked look we will ever have into his mind other than through a mythological lens of his core books.  The LETTERS are a treasure-trove of intellectual delight, and with such keen, piercing wit, humility, and a beautiful Catholic faith, it is wonderful to know that Tolkien was as wonderful as we all secretly hoped he would be.  What is also so humanizing about it is because you also see Tolkien frustrated, hurt, and just trying to provide for his family.  He's not perfect by any means, which makes LETTERS all the more endearing.  The most heart breaking line in this book is the very last: \\"It is stuff, sticky, and rainy at present - but forecast are more favourable.\\"  This was written a mere four days before death overtook him.  He was moving to a much better place. <br /> <br />Tolkien once said if you truly wanted to know him read LOTR and THE SILMARILLION.  Those are, naturally, the best places to start, because Tolkien's mind moved primarily along mythological grooves.  However, for a more conventional portrait of this remarkable man, there's no better place to start than THE LETTERS OF J. R. R. TOLKIEN.	2005-07-26
US	50704475	R3HMECN6M60B5N	0439784549	162568542	Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (Book 6)	Books	3	114	147	N	N	The Star Wars Episode I Equivalent of the Harry Potter novels.	While the proceeding five novels of the Harry Potter sequence had interesting stories in their own right, \\"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince\\", much like Star Wars Episode I[[ASIN:B00003CX5P Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace (Widescreen Edition)]], felt much more like a trailer to upcoming events than an interesting story in its own right.<br /><br />While \\"Star Wars: Episide I - The Phantom Menance\\" was undeniably a train wreck, especially with that travesty of Jar Jar Binks, the movie introduced all the key characters of the new trilogy.  \\"Star Wars: Episide I - The Phantom Menance\\"'s principal function was this introduction, and setting into motion the events that would lead the characters to their ultimate destiny.  In this regard, \\"Star Wars: Episide I - The Phantom Menance\\" and the sixth Harry Potter are remarkably similar.<br /><br />Of course, the real difference is Rowling had five full novels before hand, whereas Lucas had only one movie to introduce his new set of characters.  While the other books in the series always advanced the overall story's arc, Rowling always managed to have succinct, stand-alone novels that stood remarkably well on their own right.  HALF BLOOD PRINCE is very much the exception to the rule in this regard.  \\"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince\\" is so exposition heavy, setting all the foundation work for the seventh book, that it relegates its own plotline as largely secondary.  Let me elaborate.<br /><br />In the proceeding five novels, each title drove the book's overall plot.  In \\"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone\\", the principal mystery was what was the stone and how to protect it.  In the second book, the chamber had been reopened and there was a dangerous basilisk on the prowl.  The third (and in my opinion the best), Azkaban's escaped prisoner was the fuel driving the events of that novel.  Just as much as \\"[[ASIN:0439139600 Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire]]\\" was about the Triwizard Tournament and \\"[[ASIN:0439358078 Harry Potter And The Order Of The Phoenix]]\\" about the resistance to Voldemort, one would expect this trend to continue with \\"Half-Blood Prince\\".<br /><br />To this book's detriment, that is not the case.  While there is certainly some mystery to who this prince is, and who ultimately figures in heavily with the book's climax, \\"Half-Blood Prince\\" is much more about the seventh book than anything else.  In the American cover art, you have Dumbledore and Harry looking at the Pevensie, which turns out to be the real meat of the book anyway.  \\"Half-Blood Prince\\" is far more about laying the seventh book's final outcome than having anything to do with some half-blood prince.<br /><br />It is disheartening to say that you could actually excise the entire \\"Half-Blood Prince\\" subplot (a subplot is really all it is), and still have largely the same novel.  The same could not be said of any of Rowling's previous work.  Of course, the irony in all this is once Harry figures out who the \\"Half-Blood Prince\\" is, he does figure very heavily in the plot, but not because he is a half blood prince.  Actually, Harry doesn't even really figure out who he is, but now we're getting into spoiler territory so I will say no more.<br /><br />As far as the death goes (there are two deaths, but the first no one will care about), it is both devastating and shocking.  Without revealing to much, it is both tremendously sad and incredibly strange that she would write out such an important and humanizing character. But following the Joseph Campbell mythological plot line that the hero must face his ultimate nemesis alone, without guidance, the death makes sense.<br /><br />As for the people saying Rowling was stealing from Tolkien's \\"[[ASIN:0544003411 The Lord of the Rings]]\\" with some of the events in this book, I'd say \\"Yeah, and?  What do you think the dementors are?  They're just ring-wraiths tweaked a little bit.\\"  Without giving to much away, I think Rowling did quite an interesting job with Voldemort's method to immortality.<br /><br />Ultimately, all \\"Half-Blood Prince\\" does is build up for the final confrontation with Voldemort in Book VII.  No other book in this series is anywhere near as exposition heavy as this installment.  While Rowling needs to set up the events for the last book, it would have been nice to have a more self-contained novel than this is, which is what the others are.<br /><br />Overall, I give the book three stars, but that is only for this weakness in the plot of the book itself.  I must confess I enjoyed this much more than \\"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix\\".  I remember buying that two years ago, anxious to return to Hogwarts to see familiar faces, old friends, and exciting times.  Unfortunately, Harry was extremely moody and pretty much a flat out ass to everyone, and I felt like why did I want to come back to see such petty bickering?  I was thrilled to see \\"Half-Blood Prince\\" did not continue this trend, even if it forget to have its own, more-or-less self contained plot.	2005-07-24

The followup to TOLKIEN'S WORLD: IMAGES OF MIDDLE EARTH, REALMS OF TOLKIEN offers more artistic renditions of (primarily) THE LORD OF THE RINGS.  The lion's share of illustrations go to the more famous artists (John Howe, Alan Lee, Ted Nasmith), but there's enough odd detours to make this both a mainstream representation of Tolkien's Middle-earth and a delightfully eclectic collection of art.  (Cor Blok's in particular are wonderfully odd, and Tolkien himself approved of Blok's paintings).  There are 58 paintings total. Like the previous volume, Tolkien's text accompanies each illustration.      What steps this up above the previous collection is where that one only had 9 artists, and Howe, Lee, and Nasmith contributed 30 of the 60 paintings, REALMS OF MIDDLE EARTH have 20 artists.  While the three aforementioned still contributed a lot, REALMS is a much more diverse collection than TOLKIEN'S WORLD, making it a more intriguing package overall.  I still like Howe the best.  He captures the dark and the light very well.  Though I don't agree with all the visual interpretations, alternate points of view are what make books such as this so appealing.  It's certainly quite a book.    THE LORD OF THE RINGS is the primary focus of this book.  44 of the 58 paintings come from LOTR, including Howe illustrating THE RETURN OF THE SHADOW, Vol VI of HISTORY OF MIDDLE EARTH, and MORGOTH'S RING.  There are 12 illustrations depicting THE HOBBIT.  There are 2 by Howe illustrating UNFINISHED TALES and MORGOTH'S RING.  No other works are represented.  THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING has 18 paintings (including Howe's illustration from RETURN OF THE SHADOW).  THE TWO TOWER has 18 paintings.  THE RETURN OF THE KING has 8 paintings.    These are the illustrators, with the list of paintings and from which book they are illustrating.  Most have biographical blurbs in the book's back; those that don't are noted.    Nicholas Bayrachny: 3 paintings from The Hobbit.   \\"Gollum.\\"  \\"The Great Goblin.\\"\\"Beorn.\\"    Cor Blok: 4 paintings, three from LOTR and one from HOBBIT.  \\"The Game of Riddles.\\" The Hobbit.   \\"Frodo's Vision\\" The Fellowship of the Ring. \\"Battle of the Hornburg.\\"  \\"The Mumak of Harad.\\" The Two Towers.

The only strange omission is the front cover art is not in the book.  Overall, more eclectic and odd than its predcessor, helped by the fact that three artists did not contribute half the book this time.  If you liked TOLKIEN'S WORLD, REALMS OF TOLKIEN is a logical buy.	2004-11-24
US	50704475	R1R7445IN8O5PK	0618083553	531902706	The History of the Lord of the Rings	Books	5	104	106	N	N	A graduate course in the creation of a masterpiece	Probably the most accessible volumes of the admittedly very dry HISTORY OF MIDDLE-EARTH series to the general reader, this box set covers the evolution of Tolkien's masterpiece, THE LORD OF THE RINGS.  This is a graduate level look at what goes in the making of a literary masterpiece.  As you read through this box set, you see Tolkien's imagination at work, toying with ideas, names, possible plot lines, and just the general struggle to get through the work.  This is not a fun, entertaining read that you pick up; this is a scholarly look out the evolution of one of the most significant novels of the twentieth century, and an opportunity almost never granted to readers.  The biggest weakness of this set is it does not include THE PEOPLES OF MIDDLE-EARTH, which details the evolution of the appendices, as well as giving the full text to THE LORD OF THE RING's aborted sequel, THE NEW SHADOW.  A strange omission, especially since the last volume is so slim<br />Throughout the series, Christopher Tolkien illuminates how directionless his father truly was, and how little he actually knew when writing THE LORD OF THE RINGS.  What is truly startling about these books (and the most encouraging) are how much was unknown when Tolkien begun the first chapter.  Indeed, for the half of FELLOWSHIP, Tolkien was largely raiding his own, pre-existing larder, sending the hobbits through already exisiting situations that Tolkien had envisioned in his poetry (see Tom Shippey's AUTHOR OF THE CENTURY for more about this).<br />The changes are absolutely phenomenal.  We see a great number of name-shifting throughout the original hobbits.  We watch the evolution of Aragorn, originally a rustic hobbit of Bree, turn into the very heir of Isildur himself, come to reclaim the vacant throne of Gondor.  We see Treebeard, a malignant, evil character originally, become one of the key players in winning the war of the ring.  We watch Tolkien work through the problem of Gandalf's appearance as the hobbits set out from the Shire; Tolkien was just as puzzled at what happened to Gandalf as the hobbits were.  His disappearance led to the birth of the treacherous Saruman.<br />The other three books (including the slim volume THE END OF THE THIRD AGE, ordinally published as the first part of SAURON DEFEATED) gives us further insight into the creative process at work.  As new lands emerge (Lothlorian, Rohan, Fangorn), Tolkien's shifting conceptions and outlines often fall by the wayside when he writes that part of the story.  No one appears more surprised at the Palantir crashing upon the feet of Orthanc than Tolkien, though he instantly knew what this mysterious seeing stone was.  Faramir, Boromir's younger brother and one who beats back the desire of the Ruling Ring, succeeding where his brother failed, appears in Ilthilien, unknown and unannoucned.  We see a very different Helm's Deep, as well as the evolution of the Paths of the Dead and the story of Denethor.  The Shire's Scourging is also quite different, with Frodo taking a much more dominant role in the uprising to reclaim the hobbits' homeland.  Christopher spends a lot of time on Tolkien's continual cross-checking of the internal chronology of the work, right down to the very phases of the moon.  This effect cost Tolkien a lot of labour, and, like his actual constructions of his imaginary languages, have never been done so well in other fantasy works.<br />One of the biggest revelations comes during the last book, when we finally get to read the long lost epilogue about Sam and his family.  Tolkien wisely cut this; the epilogue's presence would have destroyed the deeply meloncholy, emotionally charged departure at the Grey Havens and Sam coming home to Rosie with one of the book's best lines.  \\"Well, I'm back,\\" brings the entire quest back home, but we all know Sam, or any of us for that matter, can never truly come back after going through such harrowing and challenging experiences as he and the rest of the Fellowship went through.  However, it is very refreshing to see Sam's large family a lot closer up than we get to in the finished work.  Quite sentimental, it shows Tolkien had quite the soft spot for those hobbits of his.<br />Overall, a stunning, and almost never given, opportunity to watch one of this century's most important writers go through the creative process.  This set gives the most encouragement to aspiring and struggling writers, for it shows, first and foremost, that writing is a process, not a finished product.  Highly recommended for the serious Tolkien student and fan, and for writers interested in watching a master at work.ellowship went through.

US	50704475	R18MSPHKANIB7H	0345466462	677990883	Tolkien Fantasy Tales Box Set (The Tolkien Reader/The Silmarillion/Unfinished Tales/Sir Gawain and the Green Knight)	Books	5	220	221	N	N	The many facets of Tolkien's genius.  Don't miss it!!!	This box set is the next logical step for those Tolkien readers looking to see where there is beyond THE LORD OF THE RINGS and THE HOBBIT.  I'll deal with the four works individually.<br />THE TOLKIEN READER:  This book contain's Tolkien's shorter fiction and works, including a play and Leaf by Niggle. There are four works in total: <br />1. The Homecoming of Beorhtnoth, Beorhthelm's Son: a play dealing with two men after the Battle of Maldon. Interesting, and shows more of the scholarly side of Tolkien.<BR>2. TREE AND LEAF: This is a book consisting of two things: his essay on faerie tales, and Leaf By Niggle. Tolkien's essay is now considered one of the main centerpieces of literature defending and validating fantasy and faerie tale (as if THE LORD OF THE RINGS and THE HOBBIT weren't enough). Leaf By Niggle is a very deep work, and basically it deals with his despair of mortality and not being able to finish his mythology, his great work. However, in the end Tolkien shows his glorious hope. <BR>3. FARMER GILES OF HAM: a mock medieval story. Everything that THE LORD OF THE RINGS represents, this story pokes fun at and parodies. Very funny story, and shows Tolkien's sense of humour. This was written originally for his children (as much of his stuff was).<BR>4. THE ADVENTURES OF TOM BOMBADIL: This is a very misleading title. It is a collection of poetry, and only the first two poems have anything to do with Bombadil. The rest of the poetry deals with Middle-earth, or set therein. It is a nice selection of his verse. <br />Overall, a well put together anthology. However, it would have been better had it included SMITH OF WOOTTON MAJOR. That, along with the two works constituting TREE AND LEAF, is the closest thing to autobiography he ever wrote, and all three are vitally important in any serious study of Tolkien. <br />THE SILMARILLION: The heart of Tolkien's mythology, providing the vast, mythic backdrop that made THE LORD OF THE RINGS so satisfying.  As important toTolkien as LOTR, THE SILMARILION is long, epic history of the Satanic Morgoth, the far more deadly lord of Sauron, and his dealings with the three tribes of Elves (The Noldor, the Teleri, and the Vanyar.).  Difficult and dry, but immensely rewarding for those who love mythology.  There are four short works, plus THE SILMARILLION proper.  These are:<br />1.  The AINULINDALE: Tolkien's beautiful creation myth.  Details how Iluvator (God) brought the world into being through song, with the vast angelic hosts (the Valar) adding their special touches to Arda, or Creation.  Tolkien gives us an account of the fall, showing how Morgoth created strife and war musically, and introduces the main Valar.  A wonderful creation myth.<BR>2.  VALAQUENTA: A who's who of the major gods.  <BR>3.  QUENTA SILMARILLION: The major account of the Elves' fall from grace, and how Feanor, crafting three jewels called the Silmarils, leads his tribe to war after Morgoth steals them.  Complex, beautiful, and amazing, this is hard-core mythology that, while difficult for the modern reader, will prove wonderfully fulfilling for those persevere.<BR>4. The AKALLABETH: The downfall of Numenor, Tolkien's version of Atlantis.  Woefully short, the events of the Second Age would have made a wonderful successor to LOTR.  Deals with Sauron's enslavement of men's hearts and how men became corrupt with the lust for immortality.  Much more focused on men instead of elves.<BR>5.  THE RINGS OF POWER: The account of the Lord of the Rings.<br />Overall, a very highly comperessed text, with thousands of years compressed relative short chatpers.  As you can see, the half a million words that Tolkien tells LOTR in is compressed to a very short text.  How Tolkien taken the same conventions with THE SILMARILION as he did with LOTR, we would have an extremely long book.  Arcane, written in a very elevated style, this takes a special kind of reader to make it through Tolkien's tough, deeply tragic, and incredibly beautiful vision of Middle-earth's history.  The book stands as a definitive history of Middle-earth, covering all the ages and its creation.  Highly recommended for the Tolkien student.<br />UNFINISHED TALES: Exactly what it says it is.  A compendium of unfinished narratives, further detailing the three ages of Middle-earth.  Especially illuminating are \\"Tuor and his Coming to Gondolin\\" (which would have been in the 1977 SILMARILION had it been completed, \\"Aldarion and Erendis,\\" a story very unique in Tolkien's work because it is an actual story from the Second Age, wonderful revelations from the Third age, including much information about the Palantiri, the ever elusive other three wizards, new information about Theodred, Theoden's son, and revelations about the hunt for the ring.  One of the most interesting sections is 'The Quest for Erebor,\\" which another version is now included in THE ANNOTATED HOBBIT.  This is the last scene we get of Gandalf and the hobbits.  Told after the coronation of Aragorn in Minas Tirith, Gandalf discusses arranging for Bilbo to join with Thorin, and gives an hitherto unknown account of how the events of THE HOBBIT really came to be.  Highly interesting.  <br />Very interesting reading, but in the end UNFINISHED TALES is more lost lore than anything.  Read only after you've read the big three (LOTR, HOBBIT, and SILMARILION).<br /> SIR GAWAIN AND THE GREEN KNIGHT: Three medieval poems.  Great for the student and acadmic, but may not be real appealing to a mass audience.  Due to Tolkien's remarkable linquistic skills, these are very accurate modern translations of the ancient texts.  Sir Gawain is an Arthurian tale.  Also includes the two shorter poems, \\"Pearl\\" and \\"Sir Orfeo\\".<br />In the end, a wonderful introduction to Tolkien's other works.  Shows the more academic, scholary side of Tolkien.  The most important work included here for the LOTR fan is THE SILMARILION.  The rest are for the fans looking to go beyond Middle-earth.	2004-06-04
US	50704475	RVI4TKAR1YB2V	0345466454	965341493	The Histories of Middle Earth, Volumes 1-5	Books	5	499	511	N	N	For the serious student and avid lover of Middle-earth	With this compilation of the mammoth HISTORY OF MIDDLE-EARTH, we get the literary backstory, so to say, of J. R. R. Tolkien's turmoil and travails of the composition of one of the most complex fantasies every constructed.  Admittedly difficult reading, you must have a deep, abiding interest in mythology and Tolkien's desire to create one to get through this, and you need a working knowledge of Tolkien's work to really understand the HISTORY.  Do not buy this expecting anything as nearly accessible [[ASIN:0544003411 The Lord of the Rings]] or [[ASIN:0618134700 The Annotated Hobbit]].  The real meat, to literary historians who are not specialized in Tolkien and to the causal fan, is the volumes VI-IX, which deal with the creation of \\"The Lord of the Rings\\", one of the most significant volumes ever released the world, online with Homer, Virgil, and Dante.  This is a graduate level look at what goes in the making of a literary masterpiece.  These four volumes are [[ASIN:061808357X The Return of the Shadow: The History of The Lord of the Rings, Part One (The History of Middle-Earth, Vol. 6)]], [[ASIN:0618083588 The Treason of Isengard: The History of The Lord of the Rings, Part Two (The History of Middle-Earth, Vol. 7)]],  [[ASIN:0618083596 The War of the Ring: The History of The Lord of the Rings, Part Three (The History of Middle-Earth, Vol. 8)]], and SAURON DEFEATED [[ASIN:0395606497 Sauron Defeated: The History of The Lord of the Rings, Part Four (The History of Middle-Earth, Vol. 9)]], also available in its own set [[ASIN:0618083553 The History of the Lord of the Rings]].  The HISTORY operates as a chronicle of the evolutionary processes of one of the most ambitious literary projects of the 20th century.<br /><br />Gathering the first five volumes, this box set covers Tolkien's mythology from the earliest written texts (the first two volumes) to the mid 1930s, before Tolkien set aside THE SILMARILLION to begin work on his epic novel, THE LORD OF THE RINGS.<br /><br/>The first two volumes deal with the earliest form of THE SILMARILLION.  In many ways, startlingly different than the forms the legends finally found themselves in the published work.  The prose is work-man-like, and a far cry from the more accomplished writings of the later volumes.  Most interesting is in the original form Beren was an elf, which totally changes a massive strand in the mythology.  The next are the epic [[ASIN:B008T1XHDO The Lays of Beleriand (The History of Middle-Earth, Vol. 3) First edition by Tolkien, J.R.R. published by Houghton Mifflin Hardcover]] that were never completed, and showing Tolkien was a poet of very accomplished calibre.  [[ASIN:B004C2GWHC By J.R.R. Tolkien: The Shaping of Middle-Earth: The Quenta, the Ambarkanta and the Annals (The History of Middle-Earth, Vol. 4)]] deals with the geography and physical history and includes some historical Annals.  [[ASIN:B00135TZ9S The Lost Road and Other Writings: Language and Legend before the Lord of the Rings]] shows us an unfinished novel and several other unearthed treasures, including invaluable philological material that shows how inseperable Tolkien's linguistics was from his creative writing.<br /><br />This publication is for the serious student and lover of J. R. R. Tolkien's work.  The causal fan will find this much too expensive and much too expansive.  For those only marginally interested the volumes dealing with THE LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy novel should be looked at.  But those who love Middle-earth and want to marvel at Tolkien's work, this is a must-have purchase.  It's a very rare opportunity to see the creation of a work of such massive import to our international societies.  Tolkien's commitment to this birthing process of a beautiful work of art truly stands out as one of the great efforts of Man to give homage to his God, as Tolkien saw it (read his essay on Faerie Stories), and I see it as well.  Get it and become immersed - though beware this detailing the construction of this elaborate universe, which means these are rough drafts and various other things that didn't make it into publication in Tolkien's time, adding a huge amount of material to Tolkien's fandom to consider.  Christopher's editorial notes are a must have.  Thanks to the Tolkien family and to Christopher for their support of their father (who died in 1973) and of his son for the publication of this work.  A very unique moment in literary history indeed.	2004-06-04
US	50704475	R3AKRY25XS1O6V	0156027704	401287515	The Dark Tower and Other Stories	Books	3	0	0	N	N	One suspect novel fragment and some other works.	I'm not going into the question whether Jack Lewis wrote The Dark Tower or not.  Other reviews have already commented on that.  I personally agree that much of the posthumous Lewis canon, and just about everything that has come from the hands of Walter Hooper, is very highly suspect.  Given the nature of \\"The Dark Tower,\\" I highly doubt he did write it.  Much of Hooper's stories feel phony, such as the legendary bonfire and him sitting around with Lewis and Lewis asking Hooper what kind of books he wants him to write.<br /><br />What I will comment on is the quality.  Reading it, you get the sense Lewis (if it is Lewis), didn't really know where to go with his story; there are some very disturbing scenes.  The Stingingman, with all its twisted Freudian implications, gives off an aura of `bent' sexuality (to use a term from OUT OF THE SILENT PLANET).  Although there were Christian symbols in it, there was not a corresponding image of goodness and a beautiful vision of Godliness to rally around.  The trilogy is balanced in this respect: depicting horror, and counteracting that image with goodness.  The N.I.C.E. had its counterpart, the house on St. Anne's.  The staleness and artificialness of the N.I.C.E. was sharply contrasted by the natural beauty and life flowing from St. Anne's.  In PERELANDRA we have a vision of the satanic Un-Man, along with that supreme vision of beauty The Green Lady.  Not so in \\"The Dark Tower.\\"  The Stingingman is the most dominant image here.  There is nothing to balance it out here.<br /><br />The concept of this story was probably already embedded in Lewis's mind, because the ending of OUT OF THE SILENT PLANET hints at it.  \\"If there is to be any more space-traveling, it will have to be time traveling as well ...!\\"  The opening scene is dons, along with Ransom, discussing time, the only Christian being Ransom (though Lewis is there, I do not remember if he is representative of Christianity.  Must likely he is).  Most notable MacPhee is there, unchanged skeptic later to appear in THAT HIDEOUS STRENGTH.  The story is that these dons have a chronoscope that can see into an \\"Othertime\\", a concept used in Lewis' completed Narnia series.  During their chronoscope experiments, they see an idol, one head and many bodies, along with a horned man.  This horn man stings these people that come to pray to the idol in this room.  The people stung become automatons and some grow horns.  Soon they realize one of these automatons (which later turns into a Stingingman) looks remarkable like one of their own dons' assistant Scudamour.  Scudamoure is not only in there, but also a double of his fiancee Camilla.  Scudamour destroys the chronoscope, and is transported into the Othertime, where he has to convince Camilla he will not sting her.  The Dark Tower and its city is besieged by White Riders, who desire to destroy the stinging man and his damned city of evil.  When Scudamour was there, he could not say God, because it was not in their vocabulary/  One thinks of Gandalf the White Rider.<br /><br />When read to the Inklings (presuming it is an authentic work; when asked, many of the Inklings never heard of this story), some thought of the main antagonist, the Stingingmen, had unpleasant sexual connotations.  But there is some good stuff, such as Camilla.  \\"She was so free to talk about things her grandmother could not mention that ransom once said he wondered if she were free to talk about anything else.\\"  To bad that it ended where it did; the plot was actually getting very intriguing.  A vastly interesting fragment, although it is so disappointing it is only that - a fragment.<br /><br />The rest are interesting.  In THE MAN BORN BLIND, the story is told of in TOLKIEN AND THE SILMARILLION by Clyde S. Kilby, and out-of-print dated book about Tolkien.  To quote my own review of that book, I do so now:<br /><br />\\"A very notable feature is it also talked about the then unpublished C. S. Lewis short story about a man born blind and then getting his eyesight back by surgery, he doesn't understand the concept of light, thinking it a solid substance. It sounds something of a tribute to MacDonald's musing on lights as emphasized in his faerie tales. Or perhaps it was insipiered by that . . . . It is different than the story in some respects, and Hooper felt that Tolkien probably was told a version and had not read the story. \\"<br /><br />THE SHODDY LANDS is about a man getting an inside view into a vain person's mind (a woman's).  A stream of consciousness piece, which Lewis liked to call \\"Steam of Consciousness\\" is rather charming. This, and MINISTERING ANGELS, a story about a bunch of [prostitutes] going to relieve \\"sexual tension\\" of males upon Mars, which has rather comic events (the story was suggested by a serious suggestion by Dr. Robert S. Richardson in his article `The Day After We Land on Mars.\\" were published in periodicals SF magazines.<br /><br />FORMS OF THINGS UNKNOWN is a piece about mythology on the moon, and very entertaining.  The surprise ending, if you are familiar with mythology, is a very good idea, though if you are not then the whole story's point will be lost on you.  AFTER TEN YEARS would have been another TILL WE HAVE FACES had Lewis lived to complete it.  It would have been wonderful to see another work like TILL WE HAVE FACES.  The story is tantalizingly brief, but, like THE DARK TOWER, was meant to be a complete novel.<br /><br />This review used Hooper's preface and David C. Downing's PLANETS IN PERIL.  Anyway, some good stuff, some bad stuff, but it is Lewis, after all. 3 stars.  3 stars because of the fragmentation, one extra because it is, after all, C. S. Lewis.  Then again, maybe it isn't Lewis. (Check the stars.)	2004-05-11
US	50704475	R1NN5XEZCUPVT5	0060653027	338167986	C. S. Lewis Signature Classics: Mere Christianity, The Screwtape Letters, A Grief Observed, The Problem of Pain, Miracles, and The Great Divorce (Boxed Set)	Books	5	26	28	N	N	Great Lewis but first box set represented his logic better.	With the release of the C. S. LEWIS SIGNATURE SERIES, which supersedes a previous box set of Lewis books, replaces a book from the original set.  Originally published with THE ABOLITION OF MAN, as opposed to the (now included) A GRIEF OBSERVED, this rearrangement of this particular set is a particularly revealing little facet of what has now become a very profitable industry built on Lewis's name.  With the public attention brought on by Lewis's marriage, there has been a marked increase and peaking of interested in Lewis's relationship to Joy Davidman.  The original set presented a very clear and rational set of apologetics.  It has now caved in to discinclude THE ABOLITION and replaces it with GRIEF.  Please do not think I am criticizing either work, for both are very important books.  THE CASE FOR CHRISTIANITY, the first book in MERE CHRISTIANITY, argues for a natural law, and ABOLITION expands and propounds on Lewis's ideas of the Tao, or moral law.  These two works are best understood when read together, and it is unfortunate they dropped ABOLITION from it.  While A GRIEF OBSERVED stands as Lewis's most personal and heart wrenching works (it is extremely beautiful), it seems out of place with the other books in this box set.  Although this stands as an introduction to the causal reader, I think this particular audience would be better serviced if there was another set of works, such as THE FOUR LOVES, TILL WE HAVE FACES, REFLECTIONS ON THE PSALMS, LETTERS TO MALCOLM, SURPRISED BY JOY, and A GRIEF OBSERVED in one nice set.  These better represent the period of Lewis's life that Joy had the most impact on, though LETTERS was published in 1963.  It still saddens me that ABOLITION was eliminated.  They could have made the set with seven books instead of six.  However, the publishers did not.  Instead of presenting Lewis's remarkable skills as an apologist, which was the original function of the original box set by presenting four nonfiction works and two works of fiction , we have a work from an entirely different period of Lewis's life.  The new addition is best read outside of this set.<br />That complaint aside, these books are central to understanding Lewis as a Christian writer, and especially as an apologist.  Most people may know him from NARNIA or one of these volumes, and it is a good place for introduction into the mind and works of C. S. Lewis. All the books here are classics, from SCREWTAPE, MERE CHRISTIANITY, and MIRACLES, as well as three other works, all of which range from profound (the majority) to beautiful (THE GREAT DIVORCE), to the gut-wrenching (A GRIEF OBSERVED).  Those interested in the works of this profound man would be amiss to be without this set.	2002-09-06
US	50704475	R18N8H81SMMFYW	068483118X	530210334	Space Trilogy	Books	5	11	11	N	N	Lewis's gift: Thought-provoking, well-written Christian Lit	C. S. Lewis's series for adults (sadly, there are only three of these, not seven like THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA) combine the several elements that make of this phenomenal writer: scholar and literary critic, story teller, Christian, myth-maker, brilliant debater.  Whether he is giving us a (what appears on the surface) an imaginative excursion into Mars, a psychological study of temptation, or a satiric novel which covers so intellectual, scholarly, and religious ground that it is about to burst at the seams, Lewis always maintains a very high level of deft analysis of our humanity and gives us myth so we may learn and benefit from it spiritually.  The first will be the best for those readers looking for traditional SF, but make no mistake: Lewis took that genre and revolutionized it, incorporating theology into SF, which up to that time had not been done to such a successful degree, and as a result OSP is a very influential book in that regard.. His story is fundamentally Christian, yet most of its original reviews did not notice this fact.  As for PERELANDRA, Lewis never gives us a better picture of the psychology of temptation and how we are all responsibilities for our actions.  Only in THE SCREWTAPE LETTERS and TILL WE HAVE FACES does Lewis demonstrate such acute awareness about the foibles of man and how easy we can fall away or hide ourselves from God.  THAT HIDEOUS STRENGTH incorporates social and political commentary, Arthurian mythology, religious elements, scholary elements, and an entire host of intellectual concerns that Lewis wanted to address.  <br />Conclusion?  This series shows us the brilliance of a mind and the depths Christian fiction can obtain.  For those Christians who wish the Christian fiction  market could be more substantial and have such wide respect as secular literature, this series is a godsend, proving conclusively that Christianity can be approached from a logical, rational mind set and still be valid philosophically, exhibiting a most appropriate sense of wonder at God's majesty.  Lewis was truly one of Christianity's greatest writers.	2001-10-22
US	50704475	R3CPJM9Z7XMS2F	0671039075	839969281	Dragonworld	Books	4	8	10	N	N	For all those dragon lovers out there this is a must read.	Very solid fantasy which rapidly draws the reader into the fully realised world that Preiss and Reaves have created for this wonderful novel about dragons, mystical Pearls, political intrigue, and the attempt at justice for the murders of three children.  This novel came highly recommended, and I've a story brewing in my head about dragons and humans.  The relationship between these two races has always been of chief interest to me in fantasy literature and one of my chief pleasures from this book was the stately and regal relationship the dragons had with the humans and how myth had obscured the memories and must be reinstated.  The political world in this book is crucial in this regard.<br />The comparison to Tolkien is not unjust, although DRAGONWORLD lies much more closer to THE HOBBIT than THE LORD OF THE RINGS.  There simply will never be another LR.  We do not get a conflict on the cosmic level here that is the central plot of THE LORD OF THE RINGS.  If Frodo fails, the entire world is ensnared in the Darkness of Sauron.  If the characters in this novel fail, the cold drakes will prevail.  Although this is an assumption, it is a very reasonable one: in as highly detailed a world that Preiss and Reaves create, there most be other societies and cultures present in this particular sphere, and it is hinted at by the one of the characters.<br />DRAGONWORLD deals with two nations plunged in war when their efforts should be concentrated upon their common foe.  The authors guide the reader through these predominant terrains: the farmlands and villages of Fandora, the forests and battlefields of Simbala, and the cold land of the Drakes and their lairs.  There also is a good scene of the crossing of the Fandoran troops over the Strait of Balomar, a very dangerous episode where one of the characters get to show their metal and grow in character development.   <br />One of Preiss's and Reave's greatest strengths are creating fully developed characters who, without fail,draw you into the book.  Another great facet about this book is there are really no true villains in the work.  The worst character is Mesor, who cares only about his personal ambition thru Evirae.  Evirae, the best candidate for the central villain, comes off as a foolish young woman who comes across not really as wholly evil but as wholly childish.  Her ambition for ruling prevents her from being fully human, and generally the reader does not conceptualise her as formidable evil but a spoiled brat who's playing with a very real, hot fire who needs punished.  The Darkling, the chief of the coldrakes, is not truly a villain, for in his mind he is acting in his races' best interest.  Your sympathies are stretched to what would be a breaking point in writers who were unable to maintain the realism these characters demand, but Preiss and Reave's pull it off beautifully.  <br />Another great element in this book is how each side most come to terms with people on their own side.  Throughout the book, Fandorans are at conflict with Fandorans, and Simbalese in conflict with Simbalese.  This book deals with a big pet peeve of mine.  Because Amsel has a scientific mind and he can do things which are seemingly at odds with the natural world yet in actuality is only taking advantage of the natural laws, the Fandorans call him a sorcerer and a Simbalese spy.  This is partially Amsel's fault for isolating himself, and his character is being developed in this fashion throughout the novel.  Those who react in ignorance and do not listen can cause much harm, as this novel aptly illustrates. <br />The political complexities and the ingenuity stands in sharp contrast with the simple way of life of the Fandorans, and both have much to offer to one another.  Preiss's and Reave's usage of the political world in this book is crucial as it supplies much of the tension in the book from the Simbalese end.  Hawkwind, the Monarch of Simbala, most constantly deal with the fact that he was a miner who defeated the Kuln* and that he is a commoner who has risen to power by Ephirion's hand, the former monarch.  Much of the novel is Hawkwind trying to manage the war effort as well as dealing with these attempted overthrows, and with the help of Ceria, his lover and a Rayan (who is also looked down upon by the Royal Family in particular and Simbala in general), he makes a fascinating monarch indeed, and a fully competent one at that.  Because of their skills as writers, Preiss and Reaves have you cheering and hoping and then turning those hopes on their ear and bringing you into another character's situation and hoping they will make it through safe.<br />As for my own favorite scene, there is a beautiful commentary on art where the soldiers of Fandora must use iron sculptures for weapons.  The owner does not want to allow the soldiers to take them.  I won't spoil the scene for you.  It's a wonderful comment on art and the power and beauty it holds.<br />Another favorite scene of mine is the voting process in which the Royal Family must decide on how they will react to the invasion of the Fandoran Troops. Great scene, so watch out for it. <br />As for the ending, it is rather good and keeps you turning the page and the book ends setting up the sequel, which, as far as I know, Preiss and Reaves have not delivered.  Le Guin has just this year published an anthology of novellas about Earth-sea (TALES FROM EARTH-SEA) and a new novel (THE OTHER WIND) in that particular series, so never rule out the possibility of letting these excellent writers revealing more of this world to us in the future.<br />*Kuln: Cave demons that are sadly unexploited, as they sound very interesting and could have made for wonderful characters as villains.	2001-10-16
US	50704475	RMZC8SEPN0WFE	1882968042	371074418	The Marvellous Land of Snergs	Books	4	28	31	N	Y	How much other literature has been forgotten?	The only reason, and it is indeed a sad reason, that this long forgotten novel has come back into print is because it has a (slight) connection with Tolkien, one of this centurys most popular writers.  I say sad because it aptly displays how a fine writer of children stories can write a really good tale but remain obscure.  Had Tolkien not read him, although it would have quite possibly change the course of modern literature because he would not think of the hobbits as halfings (well, he might, but he said this was their source) and create them as a viable race in Middle-earth.  <br />As for the book itself?  It is a fun, light read appropriate for children about ten or so.  There is some violence in the end which may be rather frightening to young children, but nowadays they see worst on the television, and the violence is not real explicity.  E. A. Wyke-Smith incorporates the Arthurian myth of the land across the river, which Tolkien did not like.  Shame-facedly, my aquaintance with the Arthurian cycle lies much closer to dimly knowing as opposed to being an expert thereon.  <br />One thing that marks this book is Wyke-Smiths assimilation of various childrens traditions into a cohesiave whole.  The Flying Dutchman, that mythical ghost ship, is here, and witches and an ogre are present as well.  One interesting little facet are the children that are kept there (in a sort of schooling organization) are taken because they are superfluous children.  I think it is for the regulation of superfluous children.  I do not have my book with me, so I cannot say for sure.  The most memorable character for was Golithos, an ogre who lived off poorly grown cabbage and was a reformed ogre.  His struggle with his reformation proves quite humourous and, for me, is one of the best moments that childrens literature has to offer.<br />As for its relation to Tolkien, this publication will only be of interested to Tolkien scholars and fans, and probably only they will search this book out because of its influence on THE HOBBIT.  Its principle influence were the Snergs themselves, who were quite like Hobbits in height and social customs, although they do have a king.  Its a real shame that the only reason this book will be read is because of Tolkien, for it is a quite good childrens book in and of itself.  <br />The question remains, however: how other many worthwhile pieces of literature have escaped the popular canon and sank into the dusty obscurities of time? Who knows how long this will survive.  It may interest you to know that Homer wrote a third book which was a comedy and Aristotle wrote a book about comedy and both are now lost.  Very tragic.  Don't let it happen to this book, because it's a charmer.	2001-09-27

Lewis's radical literary views make this a must have!	Tolkien, in a letter to George Sayer as recorded in his biography JACK: A LIFE OF C. S. LEWIS, says that this is &quot;a great book, the only one of his [Lewis's] that gives me unalloyed pleasure.&quot;  Coming from Tolkien, this is very high praise indeed.  Originally published as ENGLISH LITERATURE IN THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY EXCLUDING DRAMA and for some inexplicable reason recently renamed, this book, Lewis's longest work, will not be found in the libraries of the causal C. S. Lewis fan for the simple fact that it is a textbook and is aimed not at the general reader but instead the academic world (even in those days there was that damned phenomena of `publish or perish!').  For those who are studying this material, however, will find the book a very remarkable one at that.  As a previous reviewer noted, Lewis began referring to this text as &quot;O Hell!&quot; as the writing process became very tedious to him.  This book was ten years in the writing, and by the time it was ended Lewis wanted to concentrate more on theology and Narnia than this &quot;critical nonsense.&quot;  The end sections of the book do not shore this weariness, however, so have no fear.<br />Although books of this sort always, by necessity, impose artificial time lines on literature which, in the long run, do not have a lot to do with the true literary history.  To study literature in the sixteenth century, one should not confine oneself to going behind or in front of the time line to get a fuller understanding of the significance of the text.  However, this is not really a fault of Lewis and it is a very difficult error to correct for literary historians.  However, Lewis pulls off this artificial time limit very well by clearly illustrating the many strenghts and the many weaknesses of this century's literature.<br />Because it is for the student of literature, much of the more radical elements of this text will be lost without a general knowledge of the preconceptions the academic world has inregard to the literature in question.  The opening chapter (&quot;New Learning and New Ignorance&quot;) stands as one of Lewis's most famous academic writing because of the sheer implications and challenges set forth in the chapter.  He debunks many of the fashionable scholarly trends, focusing on how much of what the scholars say is off base.  Lewis argues that the during the sixteenth century much of the literature proved extremely dull, saying the authors wrote like &quot;elderly men&quot;.  Toward the close of the century, however, something radical began to take place.  There was a renewal and an elevation in quality from drab to gold, as Lewis puts it.  Most literary scholars and historians think the Renaissance is responsible for this, but Lewis says this theory has no truth, because the humanists who were responsible for the Renaissance were terrible scholars and brought death to the literature they presented, presenting the classics' virtues as ills and instead focused on the way the classics said what they said.  The humanists focused on the language and left the literature itself alone.  Everything else about the literature they hated.  Lewis continually attacks the humanists, stating that &quot;the new learning [that of the humanists] created the new ignorance.&quot;  His belief that the Renaissance never occurred in England, and if it did it was of no literary importance, is as radical a literary belief as accepting the Book of Mormon to the Bible would be to a Christian.<br />The rest of the book reads as a survey of the literature of the period.  All major and quite a large number of minor authors are represented in this.  As a textbook, this stands as fascinating reading, for Lewis constantly illuminates the strengths and weaknesses of whoever he is dealing with, and his numerous quotations from the texts dealt with show the true skill of selection to prove a point.  All of the quotations give a further understanding in context of Lewis's prose.  Ifall textbooks were written with such skill and wit, there would not be the incredible resentment (myself included) of the price tag on most college text books.<br /> Lewis's 1938 on Donne, published in SEVENTEENTH CENTURY STUDIES PUBLISHED IN SIR HERBERT GRIERSON has made him the heretic and central enemy of all Donne scholars and fans.  Here he does not attack him but helps readers deal with Donne's metre.  However, Lewis only gives five pages to Donne, and he was fond of saying that &quot;Donne's place is that of a minor poet.&quot;<br />The reception of this book was fair, although the most resentment came from the academic circle.  People accused Lewis of, as Sayer says in his biography, grossly oversimplifying by presenting only two classifications: drab and gold.  Yvor Winters goes to the extreme when she says that &quot;Mr. Lewis has simply not discovered what poetry is.&quot;<br />Of all the volumes in the series this still sells the most.  Sayer notes in the aforementioned biography that &quot;many Oxford tutors still warn their students that it is `unsound but brilliantly written.'  Nevertheless, or perhaps partly because of this warning, it outsells all the other volumes in this series.&quot;  While it does not enjoy the monumental place in criticism of THE ALLEGORY OF LOVE, which many would argue is Lewis's most significant piece of criticism, partly because of the radical ideas mentioned above, this work stands as one of the most brilliant and enjoyable survey books every written.	2001-08-22

One is the H. G. Wells version, which bases more emphasis on the story and less so on science, whereas the Jules Vern school of writing Science Fiction dictates heavy emphasis on &quot;plausible&quot; science.  Where does this one fall into?  The former.  Throw in the Hardy Boys and an bit of intrigue aimed at the YA market and you've got this novel<br />Rusty McPhee discovers a murdered person inside a waste converter, introducing the conflict right off the bat..  Beings as how no one else saw it, and he's only a young person, he wants to say it simply didn't happen and that his eyes were playing tricks on him.  There is no evidence because the body has been converted in terms of waste disposal.  So the conflict sets itself up well.  In the end, he must uncover this mystery by obtaining help from the eccentric authority of the space colony and some others.  It's a well crafted mystery set in science fictional setting for the YA reader, and Coville is a wise enough rider to give Rusty certain characteristics and mannerisms (such as having a consistent habit of being late) to help maintain an aura of a person the average YA reader can relate too and want to root for him.  <br />Conclusion: Enjoyable bit of fiction from a good writer.  Personally I'd like to see him do some stuff in the adult markets.<br />Mike London<br />P. S.  For some reason, I could have swore I had posted this a long time ago.	2001-06-16
US	50704475	R20VQUNLJQN851	0374384436	567307880	A Wind in the Door (A Wrinkle in Time Quintet)	Books	5	8	8	N	N	I've been changed.	Having completed the first two books in L'Engle's TIME QUARTET, I must confess both books have kept me consistentaly amazed.  Hopefully, she will be able to sustain this through the other three books (still don't understand why its not the TIME QUINTET, other than the logic I gave in my review of A WRINKLE IN TIME, but that's neither here nor there, which, also, describes my feelings of the new paperback illustrations.  The ones that have a centaur on the cover of WRINKLE are much better than the current paperback illustrations.  They are terrible, and for me totally go against the feelings I get from reading the book.  But this is a very subjective experience -- as my review will tell you of my reading of L'Engle).  When C. S. Lewis spoke of recieving stabs of joy and glimpses of some other realm beyond when he read Norse mythology, I can adequately say the same has happened to me upon these readings.  This is the making of Myth, tempered with science fiction elements, at its finest for the contemporary scene of literature.  Both books take you on a fascinating journey, and while I do prefer the first over the second, that does not mean the second is inferiour.<br />A WIND IN THE DOOR, although labeled Children's Fiction, should be read by both children and adults.  The conflict arises when Charles Wallace sees a drove of dragons by the twins' garden.  Of course its not dragons, but it is indeed something.  Whereas TIME did experiments on the theme of time, WIND goes the other way and instead concentrates on Size.  Of course, the central character again is Meg, with the help of Calvin and Mr. Jenkins and two other characters, Proginoskes and Sporos.  Who are the last two?  Read and find out -- but both will take your imaginiation where its never been before.<br />The themes of love again arises in this, but with a unique spin of &quot;Naming&quot;.  The villians this time around, although they were present in the previous volume just without a name, are the Ecthroi(or Ecthros, singular).  They take the theme of nothingness (which shows up in LORD OF THE RINGS) and how they want to destroy creation.  God created all of this universe and this creation for specific reasons, and we all have elements and things we are to experience and encounter of the universe, the Creation, are not according to God's order.  This is a very dominant theme in this work.<br />I really don't know how to describe the effect this book has had on me.  Its like my imagination has been dipped in a brand new element of MYTH.  C. S. Lewis spoke of such an effect when he read George MacDonald's PHANTASES, and while I am not comparing these books to MacDonald, the effect is somewhat similar.  My mind goes into this, just shattered and put back together by the sheer beauty that goes in here.  The modernists are right -- language is to inadequate to describe the effect these two books have had on me (read WINESBURG, OHIO by Sherwood Anderson to get the full gest of what I'm saying).  Its books like these that make me wish things like this happened in my sphere of existence.  Its books like this and Narnia and Earthsea that make me wonder why they can't happen to me.  Don't get me wrong when I say this, but this has something that the other two I just Named do not.  I love Narnia dearly, but L'Engle satisfies something in my psyche that I have not encountered in Narnia or anywhere else for that matter.  Don't think I'm saying she's better than Lewis, because that's not what I'm saying.  Narnia has things that this does not also.  Its just there are things that are very unique to L'Engle that I have never encountered in a writer before.  Its like I've been emersed into a world of myth.  Again, while not comparing the two in content or in quality, I get this same longing, this same feeling when I read THE HOBBIT.  There's a beauty there that strikes me to the core.  But L'Engle is as different from Tolkien as she is from Lewis.  All three have something to offer(and Peake does as well, who wrote GORMENGHAST) which give me that same longing and that same sense of joy and beauty, but they get this out of me from wildly different techniques.  You probably don't understand what I'm trying to say.  If I could kythe with you, then you would be able to understand.  But that's alright.  I know one thing.<br />I've been changed.<br />Mike London	2001-02-16
US	50704475	R287ZGLEU5UH9V	0684831198	583417239	Six by Lewis: The Abolition of Man, the Great Divorce, Mere Christianity, Miracles, the Problem of Pain, the Screwtape Letters	Books	5	18	18	N	N	Outstanding Christian Apologetics!	I bought an older edition of these works, when the paperbacks were $3.95 and the overall set was $27.95 in U. S. currency.  Its one of the best overall sets I have bought.  <br />These books are central to understanding Lewis as a Christian writer, and especially as an apologist.  Most people may know him from NARNIA or one of these volumes, and it is a good place for introduction into the mind and works of C. S. Lewis.  All the classics are here, from SCREWTAPE and MERE CHRISTIANITY along with ABOLITION OF MAN and three other works, all of which range from profound (the majority) to beautiful (THE GREAT DIVORCE).<br />THE SCREWTAPE LETTERS are a series of letters written from one devil to another, and present a very interesting point of view not often heard.<br />THE GREAT DIVORCE explores the doctrine of love and how without free choice there would be no hell.  You either say &quot;Thy will be done,&quot; to God, or God says &quot;Thy will be done&quot; to you.  Its yr choice.  The framing device is a bus trip from hell to heaven.<br />THE PROBLEM OF PAIN deals with why would a benevolent and loving God include pain in his universe, and the theological ramifications that pain brings into any dicussion of God or religion.  Especially interesting, although admittedly speculative, is the chapter on animal pain.  Lewis vehemently opposed vivesection, which comes out rather strongly in his novels THAT HIDEOUS STRENGTH and THE VOYAGE OF THE DAWN TREADER.<br />MERE CHRISTIANITY stands as one of the best apologetic works for Christianity ever written.  This is a book written for the lay person, and is one of the best tools for making it accessible to nonbelievers.<br />MIRACLES, the last apologetic book he ever wrote (there are religious works by Lewis after this, but they are more relaxed and do not have a rigid central arguement), deals with the subject of miracles in the universe.<br />THE ABOLITION OF MAN is a book length essay, devided into three parts, concerning the universal code of morality which MERE CHRISTIANITY talks about in its first two books.<br />Lewis was a very versatile writer, and along with THE ESSENTIAL C. S. LEWIS you have a good start into this wonderful writer.  I have been a long time reader of him, and have only recently gotten into his literary criticism, of which none is represented here, although some in THE ESSENTIAL C. S. LEWIS.  Although some are more for the specialists, it is a particulary rewarding experience, and he is a well trained guide in the field of literature.  I highly recommend AN EXPERIMENT IN CRITICISM, which for me is his central work concerning literature.	2001-02-15
US	50704475	R3IU7SBPSE5WUC	068483605X	498635851	Watership Down (Scribner Classics)	Books	5	8	9	N	N	Jaques' Redwall can't compare to Adam's realism	Watership Down is a stupendously marvelous book about rabbits. It starts out when a young                         rabbit named Fiver, a rabbit with the gift of foresight, sees the warren they live in being                         destroyed, and they must leave there at once, with as many as will follow. He convinces his                         brother Hazel, simply because Hazel knows the truth of his dreams. They approach the Thearah,                         the head of the rabbits, but that does not go well. So they leave the warren, and the story is of                         them traveling, trying to find a home, and at last succeeding. Then they have to get does from                         another warren, Efrafa, that is run very militarily by a rabbit named General Woundwort.<br />                        That is a lot more to this novel than that extremely brief summary. You get to meet a grand sea                         gull named Kehaar. It is one of my most favoured books, and I know of none outside the                         fantasy market that touches its realm of invention.<br />                        The best thing about this novel is how thoroughly researched this is. This is not regular                         anthropomorphic fiction, where talking animals are just caricatures of humans, or they're animals                         without that true sense of their nature. The rabbits in WATERSHIP DOWN behave like real                         rabbits. I'd go so far as to call this THE LORD OF THE RINGS of this type of fiction, with                         talking animals. Adams has taken the real behaviour of rabbits and set them in a wonderful story.                         The depth of his achievement never fails to amaze me. He totally makes a believable real world                         of the rabbits, and from the rabbit's perspective. Besides being a great novel, this makes this                         work stand out even moreso. All the places, including the place Watership Down, are real                         locations in England. <br />                        Although Brian Jacques' REDWALL series is often hailed in comparision to this, in terms of                         actual scope of reality, REDWALL and all its incarnations is inferiour to his. Not that I don't like                         REDWALL. Brian Jacques has a very real gift of telling a rollicking good yarn, and his series                         deserves everything it gets. Its just that WATERSHIP DOWN is better in the sense that instead                         of taking animals and imposing them with personalities, with them losing their nature and taking                         on a definably human one, Adams did not go to that extreme. He balanced them with ultimately                         human traits necessary for the story, but still in keeping with their animal nature, with them                         behaving and acting like real rabbits. This is why I love this particular novel so much. It achieves                         a balance of animal and human qualities, of which so few stories in this particular genre attempt                         to achieve. Of course, not all these stories are trying to achieve that balance, or need too,                         because they are aiming for an entirely different point and are using anthropomorphic fiction as                         its vehicle, and that's alright. (Case in point: George Orwell's ANIMAL FARM, which is as                         every bit as good as this, although it is sofor entirely different reasons.) It gives anthropomorphic                         fiction a new height and goal to shoot too:<br />                        1. To take an animal, for purpose of a story, and with human traits and failings let us get to know                         the character and its surroundings.<br />                        2. To take the character created, and to keep it in keeping with its real species. If it's a bear or                         an otter, have the bear and otter behave like real bears and otters. It makes the fiction so very                         much richer.<br />                        The interaction between the rabbits and human society is an excellent treatise in its own right on                         man's dominance over nature. It gives a very interesting view on how animals interact and deal                         with us. They are two separate societies, and each must deal with the other. Of course, the                         humans have the overall hand. That is why, indeed, the rabbits led by Hazel and Fiver must                         forsake their home warren in the first place. On the Notice Board (name of the first chapter &quot;The                         Notice Board&quot;) there is a notice which reveals the humans will make a shopping mall or                         something like that in that location. Although this may seem strange, the only other books that I                         have read that gives a very interesting animal perspective on human society is in quite a different                         setting, with largely comic overtones. The HANK THE COWDOG books, a children's series                         greeted with enthusiastic response from both children and adults, gives a perfectly delightful view                         of human society from an animal's perspective. They are written by John R. Erickson (I'm proud                         to say I hail from his home state of Oklahoma, though now I am far removed from there).<br />                        In conclusion, one of the books I love and respect the most. His depth of invention is amazing,                         his achievement, although in a much different setting, parallels the achievements of Robert Jordan                         and J. R. R. Tolkien. This is one of those books I wished I had written (as H. G. Wells said of                         Sinclair Lewis' BABBITT, and, perhaps more importantly, Stephen King said of William                         Golding's LORD OF THE FLIES, another debut novel). I bought a hardback copy of                         SHARDIK, a novel of similar magnitude (or so they say.) I haven't read it yet. They say it                         topples this book, and if that is the case, Mr. Adams is even moreso a truly remarkable writer of                         novels.	2001-02-15

MERE CHRISTIANITY opens with this book, THE CASE FOR CHRISTIANITY, and has two other books with it that provide a central thesis for the skeptics and believers alike.  Don't buy this edition -- buy MERE CHRISTIANITY<br />That being said, this work gives in detail how there simply must be a God, and how athiesm simply does not hold water.  It also talks about dualism, the belief of the Ying and Yang, where good and evil are contained and balance out one another.  To all you Star Wars fans, this abolishes the Force and all its false theological implications.  <br />C. S. Lewis's cool clear logic, well founded arguements, and easy-to-read writing style make this one of the best of witnessing tools.

Granted, this is a book written for Tolkien's children, and it does contain some nice little word-play elements -- but lets face it: This is not a literary masterpiece -- but niether is it trash either.  With Tolkien's children's fiction, with the exception of THE HOBBIT, its not so much the quality of it but the fact that it exists.  These activities culiminated in the composistion of THE HOBBIT.  When Allen &amp; Unwin accepted it for publication and it became a runaway hit, they wanted more about 'hobbits'.  This book, MR. BLISS, THE LOST ROAD, and THE SILMARILLION (OF BEREN &amp; LUTHIEN, the poetic form, was submitted with perhaps FARMER GILES as well)found its way to the publishing house in 1937.  But Sir Stanely Unwin wanted not these but a hobbit sequel, of which we all know what happened with that.<br />This being said, ROVERANDOM shows Tolkien delighting in the position of a story teller for his children.  The love and warmth shows clearly in these pages, and while its not the best thing ever written, it does have its charms. Largely, however, this work is for Tolkien completists, and by and large will not win over any fans.  But if you looking for a book to read to your younger children and you want it to be Tolkien, this is a good choice.  But if they're a little older, give 'em the real meat and introduce them to that lovable Bilbo Baggins.  Its worth a look, but not necessarily a second or third.	2001-02-08

Lewis is a very rich and rewarding author, and joy rests as one of the central elements in his thought, and one of the major components of his conversion.  A scholarly volume should be written exploring this whole avenue of Lewis.  This thoughts on joy and its implications to humanity touchs almost everything he has ever written.  Little books like these cannot capture the magnitude of this central theme in the works of C. S. Lewis.  The importance to this theme cannot be overstated when regarding Lewis, and it also explains much of what makes literature in general and myth (in the Tolkien and Lewis sense) in specific so important, because it creates a longing that can only be satisfied in Christ.

I had plans of doing a novel where all emotion is stripped away, set in a world much like THE GIVER.  Then when I read it, I was somewhat concerned for my own work.<br />Anyway, this is often comparted to a children's 1984.  Yes, while it does bear resemblance to 1984, this book is wonderful on its own terms.  The story is the world has been taken down into a utopia, a place with no crime and no feeling, no true feeling.  The family establishment is essentially nil with no sexuality at all (this resembles the dominant theme in my own work).  Birth Mothers are the source of the population, though it does not give the identity of the fathers.  Work and family comes about by selection.  Jonas, the hero, has been selected to be the Reciever of Memory.  It is here he realises how shockingly sterile and devoid of beauty his world truly is.  The ending, somewhat vague, rewards the reader by not giving away to much detail.<br />For those readers who will be travelling on to Orwell after this, go to ANIMAL FARM, my own personal favorite, and then 1984 for when they're older.  <br />Like all good children's literature, this book deserves to be read by both adults and children alike.

US	50704475	R1WRZFEIJA1G72	0521422817	383860912	An Experiment in Criticism (Canto)	Books	5	42	45	N	N	One of the most important books written on Art: READ IT NOW!	As a person whose life is dedicated to art in all its various incarnations, this has proved the single most enlightening work I have ever had the pleasure of reading.  While it itself is literary criticism and in one sense not literature but a study thereof, it's the most radical, revolutionary book I have read regarding art.  Before I can continue, one point needs to be cleared first.<br />I'm a Christian, and I believe the single most important priority is to lead people to the knowledge and saving grace of the Lord Jesus Christ.  You can do such through art.  However, anything that Lewis wrote that lead someone to Jesus is, of course, more important than this book in that respect.  Jesus comes first, art comes underneath that in priority, as do all things.  That being said:<br />AN EXPERIMENT IN CRITICISM is the single most important work C. S. Lewis has produced when it comes to literature and the arts.  THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA, the SPACE TRILOGY, and TILL WE HAVE FACES are literature, but this overwhelms them all - not because of what it is (a universal principle that can be applied to art), but because of what it is not (a story or work of art that not everyone will have the same taste for).  People may or may not like his fiction (although I find it rare to meet a person who doesn't like NARNIA) - but this book anyone can appreciate, especially those interested in literature in specific and art in general (for, although it concerns itself primarily with literature, this book also stands in defense of drama, music, painting, and the artistic endeavours of humankind in general).  Because there are differing tastes in terms of fiction, people who will not read Lewis's own literature will (or should) read this.  This element comes into play at the last chapter, where Lewis brings out how hard it is to take down a work with this apparatus, because, while you may not enjoy a work, others may.  Literature is a very highly subjective experience.<br />CRITICISM's central argument rests in the fact that books should not be judged by some arbitrary critical analyses, but by what response it elicits in the reader.  This book contains one of Lewis's famous quotes, at the end of the Epilogue: \\"But in reading literature I become a thousand men and yet remain myself.\\"  That is the central thesis of this work: not to approach a piece of literature, or movie, or painting, or drama, as something to experience and forget immediately afterward, but to enter into it, surrender to it, and approach it with an open mind.  That is one thing that is so great about this book - even people who have prejudices against Lewis can read this work.   <br />It also points out the central flaw in evaluative criticism: it may dominate and wipe away the chance at a reader appreciated the work for what it really is, and to experience it in the reader's own way.  Lewis does not argue that all evaluative criticism is bad - there's a very human need, he says, to `compare notes', and that is normal, but to much has been given over to this `note comparison' and not enough to the actual work of art.  People, especially students (Lewis was, by profession, a medieval literature professor), had quite a broad range of knowledge concerning Chaucerian and Shakespearian criticism and hardly any of Chaucer or Shakespeare (he cited this example at the end of the last chapter).  To much has been given over to criticism.<br />Although I will continue to write reviews, this book has forever changed my approach.  Lewis states that one can have an appreciation of a work without the critics, but one CANNOT have an appreciation of the critics without the author.  Now I propose that all reviewers should read this book, and keep this in mind when writing.  I certainly will.  It is also my personal belief that anyone in universities who are studying literature should be required to read this book at the start of their very first semester, so they may examine their motives of precisely WHY they are in this study.<br />Indeed, the biggest tragedy of this book is, I fear, it is not highly enough read.  Regardless of your views on C. S. Lewis, this is one book everyone should read who professes a love for art, and ESPECIALLY by all who write literary criticism.  And while that profession does have a place in our world (where would academia be without it? `Publish or perish!'), it is superseded in importance by the art that it deals with, and we should first immerse ourselves in it, sometimes several times over, before we turn away and reach for that scholarly volume.  And if it's a good work, it will only encourage you more to go to the work at hand and discover for yourself what the art can do for you.  (Shippey's ROAD TO MIDDLE-EARTH is a good example of a well-written criticism).  Lewis said one good element about criticism is, if the critics truly care for the art, the enthusiasm will be apparent, and it may cause you to read literature otherwise unknown to you.  Also, a central element is the difficulty in producing condemnation to a work.  It's a good case against censorship, because although a great work can be abused, it can also be used properly.  One may classical images and use it as pornography - while one may look at it and fall in love with the Renaissance.  Of course, PLAYBOY is mainly used for lust.  <br />A side note: Pay close attention to the chapter on MYTH, which is a central element in both Tolkien and Lewis.  This alone should make it required reading for anyone who study the lives of these two great Christian writers.  This work also shows you the depth of versatility of how well-read C. S. Lewis actually was, and shows his phenomenal memory of such things.	2001-02-07

A WRINKLE IN TIME is one of those books that have a sterling reputation, and a book I had been meaning to read for a long time.  It was worth the wait, being one of the most memorable and unusual books I've read.  For you old school gamers, perhaps Mother Brain off Metroid came from the villain here?  Just a thought.<br />The story is tightly written, very good buildup of characters, dominant themes very apparent (acceptance, curiosity, and very importantly: love), plausible resolution.  All the characters are very memorable, people you would love to meet in real life.  Charles Wallace is one of the most intriguing of all characters I have met in literature, and it's a shame we don't get to see more of the REAL C. W. (to those of you who have read the book you know what I mean).  The images and story are so diverse, so far reaching I consumed the story rather quickly.  To those of you familiar with C. S. Lewis, he said one of the purposes of literature, and primarily myth, is to give you `stabs of joy', awaken a spiritually yearning that ultimately is consummated in the character of Christ Jesus.  This book is myth.  I wanted to go to the land of the centaurs and bask in that glory.  This story awakens a longing and a yearning for things of the supernatural.  It certainly did for me.<br />I would end it at that, but I do have some issues or problems with this book.  One largely rests in the fact that the three Mrs. Ws are maintaining the illusion of haunting and witchcraft to scare away people.  No angles of God would do this, as described in the book, for \\"a joke\\" (its in the passage where Meg is attempting to help Charles Wallace at Camazots).  I do not object to magic in literature depending on how it is handled.  But I do object to this simply because they are painted as such wonderful servants of God, and there's the whole feel to the book of goodness and holiness, and then this element which for me goes completely against everything L'Engle otherwise consistently maintains in this work.<br />Another is the inclusion of The Happy Medium.  Medium is generally associated with  sorcery and evil, and wish she had chosen a better title for her than this.<br />Yet another is the feeling of universalism that predominates a particular passage in the book where Charles Wallace is describing the heroes who have fought against the encroaching darkness.  One is Jesus.  Since the book plays with the time element extensively, L'Engle should have said the Jesus won the battle already, even though we must fight it.  This I do not hold against L'Engle, simply because the doctrine is complex and very difficult to understand, but I do resent the inclusion of Buddha as one of the people who have fought against the darkness, which, oddly, is included a few lines down with a lists of artists.  My own thoughts on universalism are clouded (no, I do not believe full-blown universalism: the one I waiver back and forth with is found in THE LAST BATTLE).  But Buddhism is a false religion, and he did not fight the darkness, although he had been deceived into thinking he had.<br />While, for me, those things I've cited above do detract from this book, the story is wonderful, and one of the most remarkable books I've read.  You will be changed by this book if you allow yourself to be.  It's such an unusual book.  I just soaked it up.  Well done, L'Engle.<br />Another impression I have of L'Engle, and which she herself supports, she has a very large curiosity about the world.  There's a definite shift from NARNIA to WRINKLE.  With Lewis you feel like he's an uncle telling you this wonderful story, but he's wise.  With L'Engle, you get the feeling she's just as amazed at this worldthat's been uncovered as you are.  In an interview with L'Engle here on Amazon, she said Lewis had a lot more answers, and she had a lot more questions.  Lets see what she can turn up.<br />Mike London<br />(P. S.

US	50704475	R2DGH9N63C6MVR	0027594556	244802770	The Call of the Wild	Books	5	3	4	N	N	London's Best Work: A Modern Masterpiece of American Lit.	London achieved his masterpiece with this book.  He never wrote anything better than THE CALL Of THE WILD (first called THE SLEEPING WOLF).  It's also to redeem the dog race, which he condemned in a short story entitled \\"Diablo\\".  Ironically, London originally started out writing a short story, and instead it kept growing and growing until it reached a novel length.<br />In the late 19th century early 20th century naturalism (a literary movement that places value on science and observation with the mindset that there is no fixed morality - its only chemical by-products) is just beginning to catch hold.  Naturalism is a direct response to Realism, which Huck Finn is a prime example.  Realism came about as a literary movement in the late 1860s after the Civil War, because the writers wanted to point toward a moral code.  The movement started to fail in the late 1880s or 1890s because things weren't getting better.  Naturalism, especially in this book (although CALL OF THE WILD has many things foreign to naturalism as well), contends there is no moral code, and that the way to get to the true explanation of life is to really get back to nature and observation and science.  Although fundamentally opposed to naturalism (read C. S. Lewis's ABOLITION OF MAN for a detailed argument, as well as THE CASE FOR CHRISTIANITY, the first two books in MERE CHRISTIANITY), I like this book quite a bit.  Why?  Glad you asked.  Lets take this story and make Buck a human.  Would the story have been well received?  No.  It would have gotten the same treatment SISTER CARRIE did.  The sheer genius in this book rests in the fact that Buck is a dog, and, being a dog, London can do quite a bit more.  The moral code doesn't really apply to animals in this fallen world.  There are also strong evolutionary themes in this work (Darwin just recently becoming popular in that era).<br />Another paradox to this work, since it is supposed to be naturalist, is how much Buck transforms.  In most naturalist novels the characters hardly learn anything through the course of the novel (look at Carrie at the beginning and at the end of Drieser's novel - she doesn't learn anything really, as opposed to Realist work where the moral is always clearly stated) - not so with this book. Buck not only learns but he becomes progressively more and more powerful.  The interesting thing about this novel lies in the fact that, although supposedly naturalistic, in the end Buck becomes a mythic character.  There are twelve elements of myth, and this reaches all of them.  There is a book (A Hero With A Thousand Faces I think) that goes through them all.  Anyway, and it shows up in SISTER CARRIE as well with the rocking chair serving as the symbolism, the major preoccupation with naturalist writers is why do humans have this constant yearning for something more?  London doesn't have the answers (because he didn't have Jesus), and, for a naturalist novel, the ending is very strange and out of place because it ends in a romanticized and impossible mythic realm, in a valley where the gold crowds the river beds and Buck becomes a legendary terror among the Yeehats.<br />One theme that struck me as very interesting is the theme of man (or in the case dog) against society - or more appropriately Civilization.  Civilization imposes rigid and unnatural things Buck, and he becomes aloof from all.  London describes him as a lord, and he has no real love.  Yet, as he abandons these conventions of Civilization (and in many cases morality), he falls in love with (in a man-dog relation can go of course - lets not get indecent here) John Thornton.  Yet even his love for Thornton he must abandon for the Call of the Wild.  It seems (although, as it is a dog, the lines are a lot more blurred since a lot of what London says is true for animals, but not for the human race) the closer you get to the real primal creature and abandon society's convention, the closer to the real world you are.  If you take that to apply to humans, its true and it's a lie.  Man has two natures within him, one for righteousness the other for sin.  If you are a Christian, then you will end in the place where Buck did - that land of myth that is impossible in this world.  But if you indulge your sin nature and do not come to Jesus in the end you will go to.<br />Something must be said for WHITE FANG.  WHITE FANG is this novel in reverse.  It's a story of a dog who becomes civilized, and although CALL is better WF is very good.  I tend to look upon them as companion works, with one tracing the harkening back to the wild and the other the domestication of dogs.<br />There is also a complex economic underpinning to this novel.  Jack London proclaimed himself a socialist, and yet bragged that he wrote novels for money.  Much of the motivation in this novel is economics - why would people go up to the Klondike in the first place but to get gold?  And in the end they end in the valley of gold, that land of myth.<br />Jack London was a contradictory man.  Much like Buck, he had come out of the states and went to live in London in the slums, a horrible place, one of the worst on earth at that time.  This corresponds to Buck going from sunkissed California to the Klondike, and London sought out the extremes in both situations.  In the end he committed suicide, dying at the age of 40.<br />(Just a side note: Buck is involved in the transmission of the mail at first, and at the end of the book he involves himself in the transmission of the male genetics....e that to apply to humans, its true and it's a lie.

US	50704475	R2O7FVQSSZ5KOA	1568492502	498635851	Watership Down	Books	5	15	17	N	N	Redwall can't compare to its realism	Watership Down is a stupendously marvelous book about rabbits. It starts out when a young rabbit named Fiver, a rabbit with the gift of foresight, sees the warren they live in being destroyed, and they must leave there at once, with as many as will follow. He convinces his brother Hazel, simply because Hazel knows the truth of his dreams. They approach the Thearah, the head of the rabbits, but that does not go well. So they leave the warren, and the story is of them traveling, trying to find a home, and at last succeeding. Then they have to get does from another warren, Efrafa, that is run very militarily by a rabbit named General Woundwort. <br />That is a lot more to this novel than that extremely brief summary. You get to meet a grand sea gull named Kehaar. It is one of my most favoured books, and I know of none outside the fantasy market that touches its realm of invention. <br />The best thing about this novel is how thoroughly researched this is. This is not regular anthropomorphic fiction, where talking animals are just caricatures of humans, or they're animals without that true sense of their nature. The rabbits in WATERSHIP DOWN behave like real rabbits. I'd go so far as to call this THE LORD OF THE RINGS of this type of fiction, with talking animals. Adams has taken the real behaviour of rabbits and set them in a wonderful story. The depth of his achievement never fails to amaze me. He totally makes a believable real world of the rabbits, and from the rabbit's perspective. Besides being a great novel, this makes this work stand out even more so. All the places, including the place Watership Down, are real locations in England. <br />Although Brian Jacques' REDWALL series is often hailed in comparison to this, in terms of actual scope of reality, REDWALL and all its incarnations is inferiour to his in a particular sense. Not that I don't like REDWALL. Brian Jacques has a very real gift of telling a rollicking good yarn, and his series deserves everything itgets. Its just that WATERSHIP DOWN shows more craft in the sense that instead of taking animals and imposing them with personalities (which could be said of NARNIA and other heavy weights in this type of literature as well), with them losing their nature and taking on a definably human one, Adams did not go to that extreme. He balanced them with ultimately human traits necessary for the story, but still in keeping with their animal nature, with them behaving and acting like real rabbits. This is why I love this particular novel so much. It achieves a balance of animal and human qualities, of which so few stories in this particular genre attempt to achieve, which really creates a deficit in this facet of literature. Of course, not all these stories are trying to achieve that balance, or need too, because they are aiming for an entirely different point and are using anthropomorphic fiction as its vehicle, and that's alright. (Case in point: George Orwell's ANIMAL FARM, which is as every bit as good as this, although it is so for entirely different reasons.) It gives anthropomorphic fiction a new height and goal to shoot too: <br />1. To take an animal, for purpose of a story, and with human traits and failings let us get to know the character and its surroundings. <br />2. To take the character created, and to keep it in keeping with its real species. If it's a bear or an otter, have the bear and otter behave like real bears and otters. It makes the fiction so very much richer, although naturally it will confine the work in certain aspects. <br />The interaction between the rabbits and human society is an excellent treatise in its own right on man's dominance over nature. It gives a very interesting view on how animals interact and deal with us. They are two separate societies, and each must deal with the other. Of course, the humans have the overall hand. That is why, indeed, the rabbits led by Hazel and Fiver must forsake their home warren in the first place. On the Notice Board (name of the first chapter &quot;The Notice Board&quot;) there is a notice which reveals the humans will make a shopping mall or something like that in that location. Although this may seem strange, the only other books that I have read that gives a very interesting animal perspective on human society is in quite a different setting, with largely comic overtones. The HANK THE COWDOG books, a children's series greeted with enthusiastic response from both children and adults, gives a perfectly delightful view of human society from an animal's perspective. They are written by John R. Erickson (I'm proud to say I hail from his home state of Oklahoma, though now I am far removed from there). <br />In conclusion, one of the books I love and respect the most. His depth of invention is amazing, his achievement, although in a much different setting, parallels the achievements of Robert Jordan and J. R. R. Tolkien. This is one of those books I wished I had written (as H. G. Wells said of Sinclair Lewis' BABBITT, and, perhaps more importantly, Stephen King said of William Golding's LORD OF THE FLIES, another debut novel). I bought a hardback copy of SHARDIK, a novel of similar magnitude (or so they say.) I haven't read it yet. They say it topples this book, and if that is the case, Mr. Adams is even more so a truly remarkable writer of novels.	2001-02-05

Friendship, death (of more than the physical kind), a hard life, and little  regard for morality comes across in this novel.  Her primary characters are  women, featuring her as an important writer in any Women's Lit class worth  its salt.  She holds a mirror, making us, forcing us to look, to  reinvaulate American Society, to learn from our past so we do not repeat it  in our future.  However, younger readers should not be allowed this,  because the language is harsh and there is some descriptive sexual scenes.   <br />Morrison in detail develops the relationship between Sula and Nel, and  show, in this short novel, how each move into different paths and how each  must cope with the other's decisions.  Sula becomes a seductress whilst Nel  becomes a housewife.  This woman who so loved Nel she cut off part of her  finger to protect her later destroys Nel's family.  Sula finds it difficult  to stay within proper boundaries, apt to be irresponsible, whereas Nel  counteracts her.  Morrison also shows the product of the slave mentality:  black men who did not feel responsible for their children.  She keeps this  consistently thruout her works.  In the slave nightmarish world, black men  did not have to provide for them, because that was the owner's job, and  because the white man treated them as stock the black's family structure  suffered very extensive damage which that is reflected even today in  present society.  The men would, when they wanted too, just disappear (Jude  and BoyBoy here, Paul D in Beloved). The sins of the men are very great  indeed.<br />Shadrack, who you find in the opening section, plays an important  part with his National Suicide Day (January 3).  Traditionally, water  symbolizes life, but in this novel it harkens death, and Shadrack is linked  to the water, being a fisherman.  One of the central elements Morrison  allows us to perceive is the black community's desire to better themselves,  and the white community setting them back.  The whites give the blacks  hills for farmland, saying it is prime farm land.  In one central scene,  Shadrack, leading people like a pied piper, go down, and try to cross over  a bridge unfinished.  On the symbolic level, the blacks, want of work,  wanted to cross over to the white man's land that the white man had  unfairly dominated.  Shadrack, although none follow him for years (National  Suicide Day deals with Shadrack's disgust of being alive in a society that  has a good deal of racial injustices), which culminates, with everyone  following him down to the bridge, and he, like the Pied Piper (although  Shad has a better cause) watch as death comes upon them. Water is important  here in another scene as well, as illustrated in another scene involving  Nel and Sula when they are children.  <br />Over all, an ugly novel about  harsh and bitter things.  The situations are mean, but Morrison gives us a  view into a dark part of life that many of us did not know about - I  daresay we wish we didn't, either, because when she holds the mirror up to  our face, we are quite repulsed what we see.	2000-08-05
US	50704475	RIKNCXVDSVJGK	0684801221	737092002	The Old Man and The Sea	Books	5	4	5	N	N	Classic Hemingway	THE OLD MAN AND THE SEA successfully reinstated Earnest Hemingway into literature after about a ten year absence, and what books he did have had  little critical acclaim.  He returns to his classic themes, the Hemingway  Code (endure against all odds, conflicts being man against himself and man  against nature) brilliantly enacted by an old Cuban Fisherman named  Santiago.  Actually, it is closer to a novella than a novel, short though  still packing a powerful message of not giving up, which is the central  theme is almost anything Hemingway wrote.  A similar scene, if I remember  correctly, also finds its way into ISLANDS IN THE STREAM, a posthumously  published work wherein a boy fights for hours bring in a shark in the Gulf  Stream, where this book is set.<br />The story to THE OLD MAN AND THE SEA is  simple enough.  A fisherman named Santiago goes out in a little boat,  attempting to bring in a giant marlin.  The fisherman must go out, beyond  the circle that is normally accepted, and travel in grounds (in this case  waters) to a new place that would challenge his skills.  The same theme is  touched on in the short story &quot;Snows of Kilimanjaro&quot;, about the  leopard who was high on the mountain, out of his usual bounds.  He must  endure the pain, must endure everything to get that giant marlin.  The  book, as noted in the amazon.com review, the gun element is eliminated from  this, for the fisherman Santiago has to much age to deal with that.  As  Hemingway deftly weaves, in his vintage style of stripped and bare stye of  prose writing, a spell that will leave you entranced. Ultimately, however,  the story may end in what others view as tragedy, but to me this furthers  Hemingway's maturity.  Earlier, his life was one of big game hunting  (&quot;Short Happy Life of Frances McComber&quot;,  &quot;Kilimanjaro&quot;), and Hemingway's own need to bring down game and  receive glory marvelously does not find itself in here.  One thing that is  notable is the movie follows this book to the tea, with the changing of  only ONE WORD, which in itself probably resulted from a mistake.<br />The  quote about that anyone receiving the Nobel prize didn't write anything  worthwhile, in this case, was true..  It is because of this work that got  him the Nobel Prize, which is given as a whole for the body of work, just  not a particular book.  However, because of the 10 year absence, this book  brought Hemingway back to the attention of the public - also the attention  of the Nobel people.	2000-08-04
US	50704475	RH9Q1N43PUSIE	0802449263	839959622	Little Pilgrim's Progress: From John Bunyan's Classic	Books	5	10	13	N	N	Excellent book for both children and adults	This is a great adaptation of Bunyan's classic Christian work.  It makes for great reading at bedtime, and though, being only twenty I have no  children, I have found I enjoyed this book a great deal.  It details the  account of Christian, and later his (in the original book) wife's journey  to Heaven (the Bright City).  It has been a few years since I've read this,  but I've read it four or five times, enjoying it immensely.<br />The central  problem (and this complaint is against Bunyan, not Helen E. Taylor) is,  although I have read or heard it used to be a common thing back in that  time era (1500 - 1700) to name the characters after whatever virtue or  allegorical element the author wishes to state.  Bunyan takes his allegory,  and like Lewis in THE LION, THE WITCH, AND THE WARDROBE stop telling the  story and beat you with the allegory.  (Narnia is one of my favorites, and  although I like LWW, it has earned the position of my least favorite Narnia  because several things don't jibe with me, or, instead of allowing readers  to learn or draw conclusions, Lewis specifically dominates and draws an  entirely too explicit comparison to Christianity.  It is more personal  taste than anything - though I like allegory, if one gets to explicit (like  Aslan dying, or, in this book, when Christian sees a picture of King David)  the story loses its spell over me.<br />However, this is still a great book.   Highly recommended, and if you won't want to wade through the much harder  original, adults should go with this.	2000-08-03

It is filled with  laughter and a lot of memorable elements.  Thru it all, however, the book  maintains a light comical tone, having a wonderful perspective on  parenting, a perspective that needs to be much more spread out in modern  society.  Her two other books, LIFE IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU'RE MAKING  OTHER PLANS and MURPHY MUST HAVE BEEN A MOTHER, I have not read but have  read the blurbs, and perceive it is the same type of material.   Bloomingdale belongs to the Catholic faith, so you also get that thrown  into the play, making for a nice well-rounded book on the comic  misadventures of a large family, and it also shows the beauty and wonder of  children, albeit it thrown into a comic light.  If you see this in a used  book store, pick it up if you're wanting a laugh.  The title refers to some  type of medical procedure to see if a woman is pregnant and involves  rabbits; I don't understand it (Aerosmith make reference to it in their  song &quot;Sweet Emotion&quot;, after Tyler commits fornication with a  woman).  If you know what exactly the procedure involves, send some mail my  way.  Buy the book.  Very funny.	2000-08-03

Lewis: Midwife to THE LORD OF THE RINGS	Dear Amazon.com Readers:<br /><br />Due to the largely negative feedback on this review, I looked over the text, and while I still agree with the central argument, the way it was communicated was not the best.  I revised and posted it on Amazon's UK site.  As I say in the first paragraph, I want to bring this element out to show readers a little acknowledge fact about the most important novel of the twentieth century.  Of all the reviews I've written for Amazon this stands as the one with the most important thing to say.  Ideally, reviews, etc, should be used as enhancing literature and \\"comparing notes\\" as Lewis says in his EXPERIMENT IN CRITICISM.  This is what I mean to do here, to enlighten and compare notes.  The enthusiasm of the original review is tempered with a more mature voice.  Tolkien's work is strictly his own, but I feel Lewis should get acknowledged for his contribution to fantasy literature by his encouraging Tolkien.  However, I am getting ahead of myself.  I hope this review helps you better understand the powerful literary group that was the Inklings.<br /><br />Mike London, 8-22-01.<br /><br />The Review:  It is often customary to sing the praise of Tolkien and his accomplishments, but in this review I purpose to bring out an aspect often neglected in the circle of Tolkien fans, and that is the influence his Christian brother C. S. Lewis had upon him. Because there is so much else covering Tolkien's achievements, I, in this review, will stress Lewis and how, in keeping a keen interest and continual encouragement in this work, is, in an indirect way, as much responsible as Tolkien is, though this book is none of Lewis's creation. I only choose to stress this because it seems it is not very often pointed out.<br /><br />C. S. Lewis has accomplished many things as a writer and a Christian, which an incredible amount to contribute to the world of literature. Some will argue what is his most important literary contribution, wether it be THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA, TILL WE HAVE FACES, literary criticism, or his apologetic works. But these arguments always leave out what I feel is the single most important contribution he ever made to the world of literature.<br /><br />THE LORD OF THE RINGS.<br /><br />Without Lewis, we would not have the genre of fantasy as we know it, because Tolkien would not have finished his masterpiece. In Tolkien's own words, he says, \\"But for the encouragement of C.S.L. I do not think I should ever have completed or offered for publication THE LORD OF THE RINGS,\\" in THE LETTERS OF J. R. R. TOLKIEN, #282.  Lewis said that he had no influence on Tolkien in the conventional way - that is, Lewis had no influence on WHAT he wrote. His main contribution was just to listen. He said of his own role to his famous friend was that of a midwife to Tolkien's works, not a father. As far as any substance or influence goes, I think the only appearance of C. S. Lewis in the works of Tolkien is the character Treebeard, which, according to Carpenter's biography TOLKIEN, whose voice is modeled after the speech patterns of Lewis, with his great \\"ho hum\\" voice that had a tendency to be rather booming. In Lewis's own fiction, the character of Elwin Ransom from his space trilogy is modeled after Tolkien, for Ransom, like Tolkien, is a philologist, and according to Tolkien some of his ideas and concepts regarding the discipline of philology were \\"Lewisfied\\" (Tolkien's terminology, not mine) in the character of Ransom (again, Carpenter, and I think this information is also in THE LETTERS OF J. R. R. TOLKIEN.)<br /><br />Without C. S. Lewis, Tolkien would have never completed THE LORD OF THE RINGS, and it wouldn't be published, and the fantasy market would be totally different today - if indeed it existed at all. As far as literature goes, C. S. Lewis has nothing that can compare to this (although his body of work is better than Tolkien's). It makes the accomplishment of Lewis even more drastic than before, and although it is none of his invention, in an indirect way Lewis is as much responsible, even barring THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA, for the fantasy market as Tolkien (although Lewis's greatest accomplishment in life is leading people to Jesus through his writings).<br /><br />So much has been said of the accomplishments Tolkien did little needs to be said here. Essentially, with the publication of this book (it is NOT a trilogy, as Tolkien was always quick to point out) Tolkien single handedly invented the fantasy genre as we know it today. Almost every fantasy novel today has a debt to Tolkien and THE LORD OF THE RINGS, even if the writer has never read it (which is highly unlikely). This is fantasy's masterpiece, the one that started it all. Like the Amazon.com review said, this is the Bible of fantasy. It is also, perhaps, the single greatest Christian novel ever written (Tolkien was a staunch Roman Catholic, ans his views and worship came from Middle-earth). Several poles have been taken, naming this the book of the century. Without C. S. Lewis, none of this would have been possible, because Tolkien would not have finished it. (The same can be said of his son Christopher, who read it as it was being written).<br /><br />So you see, it's because of C. S. Lewis that and Tolkien's son Christopher that Tolkien finished what has been hailed as the most important novel of the twentieth century. We owe C. S. Lewis a tremendous debt in the field of literature, and this only greatly increases that debt for the enrichment he as brought the realm of written word. This book is the single most important thing contribution he ever did in the field of literature simply because he stood fast and encouraged his friend Tolkien to see it to completion. Bravo Lewis! And of course a hearty applause for Tolkien.<br />----------<br />[I replaced the original review with the new review back in 2001.

THE GOOD EARTH is deserving of everything it got as far as accolades and awards go.  That doesn't mean it's the best book ever written (excepting the Scriptures, of course, which are of devine origin and cannot be equaled by man, THE LORD OF THE RINGS is a close contender for that honour) but it  does mean this is one classic you should probably read.<br />The biggest  reason THE GOOD EARTH had captured the reading public when it was first  published was it had given them for the first time a picture, a portrait if  you will, of China.  China had largely closed itself off to the outside  world, and by and large not a lot was known about it.  Pearl S. Buck grew  up in China, because her parents were Christian missionaries over there.  Obviously, the main character Wang Lung does not abide by the principals  Buck grew up with, and there's a reason for that.  This book's main purpose  was to give a clear cut picture of China, and Buck gives a naturalistic  portrait of her beloved country.  She tells it as it is (or was), with no  moral judgements either way...I would like to read the next two books (SONS and A HOUSE DIVIDED)  in this trilogy, which a lot of people do not know is a trilogy...I don't know if her style  is like that in all of her books, but it is sucessful enough here for the  purposes she employed them for (really, how in-depth can you get on a man's  life covering from when he is young till he dies and keep it short for the  purpose of a novel?)  There is a nice cast of characters, some you'll hate  some you'll like others you won't care...This book won her the Nobel Prize...All of her works deal with China,  and she was very prolific, though she really only had this one as a major  successful.  Some of her stuff is actually her translating other Chinese  novels into English - but her output is very high indeed.  (She shares her  life span with Tolkien.  They were both born in 1892 and they both died in  1973, which I found rather interesting being a Tolkien freak).<br />Overall, I  would give this a four stars, but I think the overall rating should be  higher than three and a half so I will give it a five.olkien freak).<br />Overall, I  would give this a four stars, but I think the overall rating should be  higher than three and a half so I will give it a five.	2000-07-19
US	50704475	R34EER4VAU3TRD	0486406555	559841412	Main Street (Dover Thrift Editions)	Books	2	39	61	N	N	Excruciatingly dull novel that has notabel literary merit	MAIN STREET is considered Lewis's Song of Songs, or his masterpiece.  Being a writer, if this was my ultimate achievement, I would be thoroughly depressed and forsake writing and take up something more worthwhile to  humanity, and not torture college and highschool students with this book  (because those will be the only ones reading this -- them, or some other  student of literature that feels like wading and enduring through this  haliaetus novel).  However, when it was first published in 1920 it sold  over 500,000 copies.  That was very significant back in those days.  Lewis  won the Nobel Prize in 1930.  His acceptance speech, now called &quot;The  Fear of American Literature&quot;, is considered one of the most important  essays on the topic.  It dealt with other writers who should have been  given this award, most notably William Faulkner.<br />The main problem with  this novel is it encapsulates everything wrong with a small town, but by  doing so makes itself very dull.  The main conflict is Carol Kennicott  trying to bring culture to an otherwise boring town.  Because of that,  Lewis spends some 400 pages (depending on your edition of course) detailing  this conflict.  The book is dull beyond comparison.  At about page 250 to  300 you're wishing it was over.  It just drags on and on and on and on.   Everything that is wrong with the small towns (in the book) is wrong with  this novel.  That does not happen very often where what the theme is saying  &quot;correct this about society&quot; the reading public is saying  &quot;correct this about this novel&quot;.  Lewis is a literary anomaly,  and his success rides largely on what era he is from - people read a lot  more back then, and if this was published now, although of high literary  merit this would not be successful at all.  <br />It would have made a great  short novel.  It would be far more tolerable, and probably much more read.   I respect what it did, showing what is wrong with small towns (althoughit  is not a balanced portrait - the towns are not as horrible, and there is  some redemptive qualities.  But Lewis does pretty much hit everything on  the head).<br />The style Lewis employed reads rather stodgy.  There have been  critical attacks on his style, while respecting his work.  People say (this  is the only work I have read by him) that all of his stuff is like this, as  far as attacking different areas.  MAIN STREET is directed to the small  towns, ARROWSMITH to the profession of Medicine, ELMER GANTRY about the  superficiality of some preachers and how they can be robbers as well as men  of God, and then there's BABBITT, which is about the small time business  man who has no moral scruples.  DODSWORTH is also listed as a major work,  though I don't know that one.  BABBITT influenced Tolkien on his children's  masterpiece THE HOBBIT and I've been meaning to read it for years, but I  won't be able to wade through another Sinclair Lewis novel for quite  sometime (BABBITT and MARVELOUS LAND OF THE SNERDS [SNERDS some type of  fantasy book] are both 'source books' for THE HOBBIT, which makes them  notable) .  After finishing this, I daren't look at another Sinclair Lewis  novel for at least a few years.  I can barely stand to pick my own copy up  of MAIN STREET and look at it, because I had to read it in a shortly  compressed time and I was so ready for it to end.  Someone said in a  previous review Lewis cut 20,000 words from it - he should of cut half the  novel and slim it down to maybe 150 or 200.  It would also make an  excellent story.  Lewis researched his stuff meticulously, and he does  deserve merit for his realistic portrayal of his chosen subjects.  It is  right on about the problems of a small town.  <br />Notable scenes: <br />The  train ride up to Gopher Prairie.  Very nice descriptions and fully realised  scene.  My personal favorite.  <br />Belle (a Swede) and Carol look at Main  Street for the first time.  We get both their contrasting perspectives.   Belle comes from an even small town thinks its great, Carol hates  it.<br />Washington, when she leaves.  <br />Unfortunately, the first two occur  at the first, this at the last.  Very dull and boring.  Would like to see  this theme used for a short story or a novel (it would make a great short  story or novella).  About the most interesting thing in between all of that  is Miles Bjornstam and Belle, which is Carol's maid.  Guy Pollack and Vida  Sherwin are also are interesting.  Raymie the artist is supposedly based  from Lewis's own life.  Dr. Kennicott is very well realized, and very  patient with &quot;Carrie&quot;, as he calls her (I prefer that over Carol  - I don't like the name Carol, and do Carrie.).  But these characters are  not enough to redeem this from a pleasurable reading session.  It is the  one of the numerous obligations of the writer to entertain his/her readers  (of course, it is the lowest purpose).  But there must be entertainment  value to the novel to get on past that and into the themes and what the  writer is trying to say.  Bestsellers are out of balance - all plot and  entertainment with no real high theme they wish to make, and this is out of  balance too with all high qualities and ideals and yet no entertainment  value at all, with most people wanting to give up in the middle, which I  certainly did (someone said they think Lewis is one of those writers if you  read one of his books you've pretty much read all of his books, and they're  all the same, which is probably true).  Lewis seems to have forgotten that  in this excruciatingly dull novel.  <br />3 stars just for the sheer impact of  the novel.  Personal taste, 1 star, so give 2 stars, though probably  deserves higher than that.	2000-07-18
US	50704475	R2GU4UMN3C0CVR	0590312413	629857126	The Castaway	Books	4	6	7	N	N	Good survival story aimed at children	I finished reading THE CASTAWAY just now.  It is a fine little book, dealing with a survival story of Daniel Ross, who is shipwrecked on an island.  He must discover how to live and survive on an island of rock that  has no life.  It is good for younger readers.  Daniel has to struggle with  loneliness, routine, and torture of old and bad memories.  The chief  narrative deals mainly with the survival of Daniel, with flash backs and  remembrances at various points along the way.  The flashbacks help feel in  the story of what happened at the seal hunting ship Daniel had taken berth  in (the ship's name was Catherine).  Also Roth uses them to detail the  relationship between him and his brother Tom, and tells us how they left on  a bad note.  Another central character is Susan, as told by his memories.   <br />Because of the type of story it is, Roth must, by definition, rely on  these flashbacks and descriptions of the environment (in this case an  island) to tell the story.  The plot is survival.  The conflict is Daniel  against Nature.  For the purpose of the book, and the audience, it does  just fine (it is probably not over thirty five or forty thousand words long  - it can easily be read in a single reading, numbering just a little past  100 pages long [108]).  If it was aimed at an adult audience, it would need  to show more of the psychological aspects of such an ordeal.  Daniel spends  a very long time on that island (how long? read the book).  But as it is a  children's story, and Roth in all probability wanted it short, does quite  well detailing the psychological and physical difficulties Daniel had to  encounter and overcome.  One charming thing (the method is charming,  anyway) that Daniel overcomes (to an extent) is loneliness.  There is an  old seal named H (largely because of markings on skull looks an H, they are  old scars), which we see a little of, and Penny, a penguin, aid Daniel in  this matter.  Penny is a quite loveable bird.  This also helpsto reinforce  that human beings are created for social interaction, and that part of us  is intrinsic with our nature.  The survival of the human species is  dependent on this drive for social interaction (without some type of social  ties there would be no society and no reproduction).<br />THE CASTAWAY is also  a true story.  Although doubtlessly embellished, true stories like that  always help to capture and fire up the human imagination.  It also shows  the strength of the survival instinct.  But I highly doubt that historians  knew all the backstory that Roth provides for his protagonist.  But  according to the opening text in the book, Roth kept true to Daniel's  possessions (a pocketknife, an oar, and the clothes on his back).  I do not  know how THE ICE HERMIT is, but it sounds largely the same thing.  If you  cannot find this, obtain that and read it.  It is largely concerned with  the same thing.  All in all, a good book for young readers (especially  those who like survival stories, but recommended to any young reader, or an  adult who wants to view the indomitable will of the species of man to  survive).  That way, it would show the strength of Daniel's resolve to  press on, even after the hope he had had on that island dissolved once he  got to the main land.  But, again, this is children's, so it is just fine  how it ends.	2000-07-11

Nice -  much in similarity to &quot;The Hill: Hobbiton-Upon-The-Water&quot; and  &quot;Bilbo Comes to the Huts of the  Raftelves&quot;.<br />&quot;Rivendell&quot;: At atmospheric piece, showing the  beauty of Rivendell.  Probably done before LOTR days or early in its  composition, because there doesn't seem enough geographic room to have the  complexities described in LOTR.  Tolkien always work much better  artistically with landscapes than people.<br />&quot;The Hall at Bag-End.   Residence of B. Baggins Esquire&quot;*:  The last illustration in the  current larger paperback.  Depicts Bilbo (a quite slim looking one,  probably immediately after returning from his Grand Adventure, without much  chance of his getting fat yet).<br />&quot;The Trolls&quot;*: Rather odd  looking trolls hiding in woods with Bilbo in the forefront.  Very  reminiscent of the illustrations of MR. BLISS.<br />&quot;The Mountain  Path&quot;*: The frontis piece for the original edition of THE SILMARILLION  (both hard and paper back).  <br />&quot;Beorn's Hall&quot;*: an illustration  depicting the Hall of Beorn.<br />*All these appear oversize paperback as are  black and white illustrations. <br />In conclusion, this is a nice little  novelty item, but of not much artistic import or consideration.  Being a  collector, of course you wouldn't actually use it for its purposes.  The  colour prints are worth having, though I'd much rather them come out with  an edition that collected all of Tolkien's published (and hopefully a few  unpublished) paintings into one nice volume.  PAINTINGS might be that,  although I have not seen the book so I could not say.  Novelty and nothing  else.  A &quot;Yellow Submarine&quot; novelty of Tolkien's literary estate,  doubtless made for pure product.<br />Is it just me, or does one ever get the  impression that the Tolkien estate is, to some extent, in it for the money.   Although THE HISTORY OF MIDDLE-EARTH series is absolutely fascinating, was  it totally necessary?  But I won't complain or harbour on that point much -  I am much glad they did it, and that is understandable.  To truly  appreciate the Labour of J.R.R. Tolkien, that did need to be published, and  with excellent commentary by his son Christopher.  The true question is  little novelty items like these: we don't really need them, and it makes it  look like they published it for product.  This, the two maps for THE HOBBIT  and LOTR, and recently I saw a tarot card game with Tolkien slapped on it.   That was my biggest outrage, because Tolkien was a committed Catholic man,  and in no way, shape, or form, would he allow an activity that calls on  Satan for guidance for one's life be advocated by him.  Personally, I hope  that his children had nothing to do with the tarot reading game, and are  aptly suing for misalignment or something or other.  But sometimes, one can  get the impression a lot of this stuff is published for the money, with a  commercial aim instead of an artistic aim.  Much of the posthumously  published stuff Tolkien wouldn't have dared send off, because he was always  revising it (that is part of the problem: he couldn't, like Niggle, make  his painting complete, but always polishing).  Much of the stuff in THE  HISTORY is first rate stuff, and, like THE BEATLES ANTHOLOGY series (with  the exception on ANTHOLOGY 1, that was more of a historic record than  anything), the people responsible for creating the art are probably the  least qualified people to judge it.  As I understand it, Christopher  Tolkien finished  THE HISTORY, but if he wants to continue publish stuff  from his father's pen, go for it.  Lets just not make it silly little  novelty items, but real stuff, real meat.  3 stars for the paintings	2000-06-26

Tolkien Handbook: A Concise Guide to His Life, Writings, and World of Middle-Earth	Books	2	67	74	N	N	Decent Affair: 3 Stars, one subtracked because of subtitle	It seems Mr Duriez has also written a &quot;Handbook&quot; (the In-Print Encyclopedia) on C.S. Lewis.  I don't know the quality of that work, but I do of this, and I mean to tell you about it.  It might be good, but I would  be wary of it, because this volume promises similar things but does not  deliver its high promises.  Instead, it offers SOME information, but  nothing comprehensive.<br />The best counsel I can give unto you is to stay  away from this book.  There's a reason it's out of print people.  It's only  an average work, not even amounting to 300 pages.  It's crossed reference,  and in the end, feels like the work of someone wanting to cash in on the  works of J.R.R. Tolkien.  There's much better works (such as Karen Wynn  Fonstad, Paul H. Kocher, and David Day) on the literary creations of  Tolkien.  This book, calling itself comprehensive, is hardly that.  This is  the subtitle to make others look and buy - but withhold yourself on the  hope that this is a first class volume.  Its not.  Its not a terrible  volume, but neither is to an excellent volume.  It's average, and for those  who really want to get into the works of Tolkien, I would suggest to have  this on your shelves along others, for different perspectives.  But it's  only use is that.  On its own, no.  With the money you were going to buy  this, I'd recommend the much more interesting LETTERS OF J.R.R. Tolkien.   If you are looking for something on Lewis' Narnia, go with Paul F. Ford's  Companion to Narnia - a first-class reference work (the revised version).   That's what a reference work is supposed to be like people, not this  average affair.<br />Mike London	2000-06-09
US	50704475	RJ77GEO8WBS19	0805420487	94824058	The Great Divorce	Books	5	23	26	N	N	Enter Joy	&quot;There are only two kinds of people in the end: those who say to God, `They will be done,' and those to whom God says `They will be done'.&quot;<br />This is a quote from this little volume, and effectively  sums up the entire book in that one sentence.  THE GREAT DIVORCE, like  Lewis's TILL WE HAVE FACES, is his song of songs, his great achievement.   Tolkien's was LORD OF THE RINGS, Adams' WATERSHIP DOWN, Sinclair Lewis'  MAIN STREET.  These novels are generally regarded as their major works.   This little book, published in a little periodical called The Guardian, is  one such book.  (It was this periodical that Lewis's classic book THE  SCREWTAPE LETTERS also appeared).  Sadly, SCREWTAPE, though excellent in  and of itself, is often given much more credit than this, which is a deeper  work (and to those who know THE SCREWTAPE LETTERS, know what a feat that  is).<br />Perhaps one reason that this work is such an excellent little volume  is its length of gestation: it was concieved in 1931 and written in 1944.   Insipred by a sermon found in Jeremy Taylor's WORKS, suggested such a  premise as to think, or take, the absuridity of damned souls getting a real  refreshment from hell.  Also another source was the fourth centru Latin  poet named Prudentius Aurelius Clemens (his contribution can be found in  &quot;Hymn for the Lighting of the Lamp).  Assuredly, one of the reasons  that it took so long to be written (the first known written account is a  diary entry by his brother Warnen on Paril 15, 1932) is he had not had it  visualized.  In terms of inspiration his fiction arose from &quot;seeing  pictures&quot; in his mind.  (Example: One of his images he received when  he was about 16, and it was a faun with parcels in one hand and an umbrella  in the other, standing in a wintery, snow laden forest).<br />Much of this  short little novel has a direct comparison or parellel to Dante's DIVINE  COMEDY.  Just like Beatrice to Dante, so also was George MacDonald to C. S.  Lewis.  MacDonald was almost a Universalist.  He believed most of the world  populace would submit and enter into joy, and know God's love.  A lot of  this would occur after death.  According to Sayer, Lewis did not believe  this, but thought it was a possibility (much my view on purgatory).  What  Lewis had to do was to rectify this belief with the others of purgatory,  hell, heaven, predestination, damnation, etc.  How he did so was a stroke  of genius: he made hell and purgatory the same place. To those who would  leave and give up a vice, it was only purgatory; but to those who were  determined to keep their wickedness, instead of entering into joy, were  damned.  To enter into Heaven, the only prerequiste was to give up a vice.   That was all.  Some lust, some apostasty, some selfishness and false love  (the mother Pam for her son Michael).  Just like Dante, Lewis has an  Apostate Anglican bishop in there. <br />One of the things that he has done  most brillantly is the potrayal of the Platonic belief that the essence of  something is more real than the thing itself.  Virture is more real that  the vitrue that is practiced.  Everything in God is much more real and  tangible than hell, and Lewis does this marvelously.  A device he borrowed  from a writer whose name was unknown to him, Lewis made everything very,  very real, and the damned men and women were but ghosts in that heavenly  place.  Each had an accompaning Spirit, one who has surrendered to God.  In  that place, the ones saved are real and can bend the grass and walk and  swim, but always traveling further up and further in (to borrow a Narnian  phrase, although it equally applies here).  To aid the damned, the real,  the saved, must go back and forsake their journey for a time, to aid those  that will.<br />One of the grandest scenes is toward the very last, in which a  lady named Sarah is seen.  In this, another of his master's ideals is  expressed.  Sarah Smith is no great woman by earth's standards, but she is  so close to God, everyone she meets she changes for the better.  God wants  to use you, not only for his own intimate purposes, but for you also to  update and bring the quality of the life for others around you to a much  better place.  Her whole train of follows is transformed by her love,  because she allows God to work through her, and submitted to her; in turn,  she transforms others, because she is a yielded vessel.  Macdonald states  of her &quot;There's joy enough in the little finger of a great saint such  as yonder lady to waken all the dead things of the universe into  life&quot;. Likewise, because of Lewis being yielded to God, this book has  a similar effect (as, perhaps, all of his books do -- I cannot say all  because I have not read all).<br />Ultimately, the entire point of this  beautiful little book is that there could be no damnation without free  choice.  God made us to fellowship with us, not to damn us to hell.  We are  to enter into joy - but because we live in a fallen world, we might choose  to hang onto some vice instead of entering into joy.  Joy, that grand and  beautiful intimacy with the Lord, real satisfying water that will forever  quench your thirst, that is what C. S. Lewis is about.  Let us not choose  to stay in Hell.  But one must understand this - Lewis is not advocating  there is such a thing as bus rides to hell.  The novel is, of course, but a  dream.  It is no way an examination of what lies after we die, although it  does give thought to MacDonald's view on Universalism, though Lewis did not  hold that view himself.  Enter into joy, dear child, and meet Christ.	2000-06-09

Imagine a children's picture book illustrated by the guy who did those two fantasy classics (THE LORD OF THE RINGS and THE  HOBBIT), involving a man with tall hats and a bad driving record, and a  very British feel, and you have MR BLISS It largely shows his distrust  turned hatred of things mechanical that destroy the environment.  But make  no mistake: this is no propaganda track written to slam pollution, it is  first and foremost a story for children, his children.  It is basically a  humourous exploration, beautifully illustrated, of what could go wrong with  an unexperienced driver (namely Mr Bliss).  Easily the strangest character  is a Girabbit, a type of animal invention that must be particular to  British society, or even more localised to Tolkien's imagination, for I  have never encountered him anywhere else; it has that feel of Britain, so  it would not surprise me if it was British and not Tolkien's own invention.   However, all of his children's fiction, save THE HOBBIT, has the  particular feel.  It is a rabbit with a very long neck (hence the name  Girabbit, combining Giraffe and Rabbit).<br />The story is that a man named Mr  Bliss goes and buys a Motor Car. Thru the course of the story, he has  several interactions with his neighbours and three bears.  His acquisition  of a motor car is quite disastrous, and momentarily devastating, and in the  end Mr Bliss finds the motor-car unnecessarily troublesome, and has  &quot;taken a great dislike to it&quot;.  This attitude he expressed in the  unpublished TALES AND SONGS OF BIMBLE BAY.  According to Carpenter, his  official biographer, Tolkien took a &quot;charge `em and they scatter&quot;  method of driving, and was much more daring than was skillful.  But here,  it is expressed humourously.  If any moral can be drawn from it, it is that  motor cars are trouble.  Afterward, Tolkien takes this attitude and  develops it in a much more sophisticated and mature form in THE LORD OF THE  RINGS.  But this story delights in being for children, and one notable word  play is two characters, of which Mr Bliss had an accident with involving  his motor car, go into business together, and they call it after their  names, which is Day and Knight.  It is this type of word play that makes  Tolkien's children's fiction notable.  <br />An interesting note about this  story is that it was to be originally published back in 1937 or 1938, when  THE HOBBIT had been accepted for publication.  On the strength of it,  Tolkien had submitted several other shorter works, including Farmer Giles,  Roverandom, this, and the Quenta Silmarillion proper.  Because of the  illustrations it proved uneconomical to publish, and was set aside for  years and years, a fate Roverandom would also share (sadly).<br />The edition  I have is nicely down, with a facsimile of the original manuscript on the  right hand side (while reading it, on the right) and then text on the left  side. His illustrations are nicely done, showing Tolkien's skill as a  (physically) visionary and not just a literary artist.  His style is  definitely all his own.  Overall, a nicely down story for Children, written  by the master of fantasy, J. R. R. Tolkien.<br />As a side note, the reason I  feel this merits five stars is because of the quality of the material; a  conventional reason.  But also because of who wrote it: a truly top shelf  mind.  A man of his level helping to entertain children . . . if I am going  to read a picture book to my child or children, I'd rather it be Tolkien  than anyone else.	2000-05-17

He brings out a lot of dark  imagery. I don't know why, but Hague's stuff just does not appeal to me.  I  have seen him do Lewis's Pilgrim's Regress, and some other stuff, and I  just don't like his style (also saw his illustrations for WIZARD OF OX).   His are of THE HOBBIT.  Galuidi has almost a computer generated quality,  and his work is especially intriguing, although there are only 2 of his  paintings in this collection.  Lee is good.  All in all, this is a fair  book, collecting the paintings of artisits brining about their own vision  of Tolkien's classic saga.  Over all, a four star book (bumped up one star  because of Howe's supreme quality).	2000-05-17

There are four works in total:<br />1.  The Homecoming of Beorhtnoth, Beorhthelm's Son: a play dealing with two men after the Battle  of Maldon.  Interesting, and shows more of the scholarly side of  Tolkien.<br />2.  Tree and Leaf: This is a book consisting of two things: his  essay on faerie tales, and Leaf By Niggle.  Tolkien's essay is now  considered one of the main centerpieces of literature defending and  validating fantasy and faerie tale (as if THE LORD OF THE RINGS and THE  HOBBIT weren't enough).  Leaf By Niggle is a very deep work, and basically  it deals with his despair of mortality and not being able to finish his  mythology, his great work.  However, in the end Tolkien shows his glorious  hope.<br />3.  Farmer Giles of Ham: a mock medieval story.  Everything that  THE LORD OF THE RINGS represents, this story pokes fun at and parodies.  Very funny story, and shows Tolkien's sense of humour.  This was written  originally for his children (as much of his stuff was).<br />4.  The  Adventures of Tom Bombadil: This is a very misleading title.  It is a  collection of poetry, and only the first two poems have anything to do with  Bombadil.  The rest of the poetry deals with Middle-earth, or set therein.  It is a nice selection of his verse.<br />Overall, a well put together  anthology.  However, it would have been better had it included SMITH OF  WOOTTON MAJOR.  That, along with the two works constituting TREE AND LEAF,  is the closest thing to autobiography he ever wrote, and all three are  vitally important in any serious study of Tolkien.	2000-05-16

Originally a journal to record his feelings and fears, this is a classic trial of faith.  Lewis is well known for his apologetics works, his logic, his wit, and his deep  sense of Christianity.  Yet here, after losing the woman he had come to  love so much, everything is thrown into dismay and despair.  God gently  takes him by the hand, and walks him through this.  To hear Lewis, this  great Christian brother, rage and acknowledge his doubt during this trial  of faith shows us we are not alone in our own trials.  To anyone who has  lost a spouse, very highly recommended.  To anyone going through a hard  time in their lives, recommended.  God will always be with you, even if you  can't see him.  Admit your doubts and work through them, with God as your  guide.  C. S. Lewis called his faith a `house of cards'.  If yours is  knocked down, let God walk you thru it, and have him build your faith on  the firm rock of Jesus Christ of Nazareth.  He loves you - yield.	2000-05-16

These writings comprise two types of reviews: unfinished reviews, abandoned during various stages of composition, and completed reviews that for life reasons were never posted. Of the later type, back in September 2001 I wrote a cache of work, a full sixteen reviews of several different C. S. Lewis books which have never been released. I am publishing these reviews now for the first time, over a decade after they were initially written.  The two bracketed opening paragraphs were written in Sept 2001 but never published.  Mike London 10-3-2012]<br /><br />[\\"Till We Have Faces\\" is essentially Lewis's view of the four loves put into action, and how destructive they can be if you abuse them. The central character, Orual, is a very selfish sister who wants her sister totally for herself. Easily the most complex all Lewis's fiction, there are so many examples of evil love throughout that the entire book can be hard to figure out as many of these are obscure. While the third book in the Space Trilogy certainly has its complexities, only this comes anywhere close to topping it for thematic complicitions, and topping it this novel does. We get a very accurate picture of why the main character has been a consumer all her life, and why she eats people up to be her own. Individuality is a thing very hateful to her. This also shows up in Screwtape's multiple letters to Wormwood.<br /><br />If published anonymously, it would be one of the few works that would be very difficult to tell it was by C. S. Lewis, as the style is so much different from his usual one. He very clearly enters into this mind of Orual and it becomes very much her own story. This is a retelling of the Cupid-Psyche myth; hence the subtitle A Myth Retold. For those readers who are most interested in reading the sheer depth of Lewis's skill as a writer, this is the best place to come.]<br /><br />TILL WE HAVE FACES, is, simply put, one of the most beautiful books I have read.  Its depths are enormous, its truth fantastically illustrated, and the author is completely given over to the character.  If you are reading  this for Lewis's style, don't.  In an amazing feat of creation, Lewis used  his God-given gift, and has completely come into Orual's mind.  This is  some of the best characterization I have ever read, with Lewis completely  laying down his own style, and yielded to that or Orual.  Although that may  be disquieting to some, it reveals the true creative power God gave that  fine Christian brother.  He immerses us into her world, told from her eyes.  The book is very, very deep, demanding several rereadings.<br /><br />The plot of  the book is a daughter is born to a king, named Psyche.  He already has two  other daughters, Orual and Redival.  Her older sister, Orual, becomes very  loving of her.  Yet this love is exactly what it ought not to be: a selfish  love.  Psyche, seemingly a goddess in the eyes of the people, must be taken  to sacrifice to the god of the grey mountains.  Orual is very distraught.  They take and leave her.  Then Orual, along with another character named  Bardia, go up to the mountain, and Orual finds Psyche, in love with the god  of the mountain.  Orual, being blind (although not physically), cannot see  the palace.  In the end, she has Psyche, who loves with selfless love, the  truest and deepest and most real of all loves, look upon Eros, the god of  the mountain, and Psyche is exiled because of her sin against the god.  She  was not to look or cast light upon him, but she did for Orual's sake.<br /><br />The king is an impotent ruler, and only after Orual takes over the  kingdom does Glome become something of a powerful place.  All things  considered, Orual really does help Glome politically and financially, and  is a much better ruler than her father was.  He is an abusive man, and is  an evil father.  He cares nothing of his daughters, and wishes for a son.  He especially resents Orual for her ugliness.<br /><br />The Fox is a Greek  philosopher brought into educate the girls as well as help the King.  Redival is least interested.  He examines through the Fox the rational  point of view.  The Fox can never live up to his beliefs, and is constantly  violating them.  He is out of balance, placing to much on reason and logic  and not enough on faith.  He greatly influences Orual.<br /><br />Redival is a  selfish one, and wants what is best for her.  This is exactly what not to  be.<br /><br />Orual: A much more complex character, and the narrator of the book.  She loves with a jealous love, a love tainted by sin and ungodliness.  She  wishes Psyche for herself, and she cannot understand why she must go away.  The book is about how she moves away from that selfish love and into the  love of Jesus Christ.  She is also marked by ugliness, and later starts  wearing a veil to hide herself.  After many years, people begin to think  her wearing the veil for, ironically, great beauty, or something more  mysterious, no face at all.  This is representative of her spiritual life.  She is ugly because of the taint of sin.  Yet, because she is made in the  likeness of God, the beauty that God gave her can be placed through.  But  as long as she remained uncured, as long as she remained [unstilled] hidden  away, she could not come face to face with God.  How could she when had no  face.  She refused to acknowledge her selfish love.  For much of her life  she worth both a physical and a spiritual veil.  Only when old age  approached, did she set down an account of the \\"evils\\" done to  her by the gods in Part I.  Then, in Part II, she lays down her veil, and  begins to examine her life, and in the end comes to peace with God.<br /><br />Psyche is the mostly Godly character, full of selfless love for others.  It is she that is Orual's love. There is much to learn from Psyche.<br /><br />In  this book, we have what Lewis wrote in his nonfiction The Four Loves.  These were written and published about the same time, and he had met Joy  Davidman, who was to be his wife.  Erotic love, that had so long passed him  by, had suddenly and out of nowhere appeared on his doorstep.  So love  weight heavily on his mind during this period of his life.  To have a  deeper appreciation of this book, read both this and his The Four Loves,  because basically he tackled the same subject in two separate genres:  fiction and nonfiction.  In that book, he says friends and lovers are  essentially different, although bound by the same reality.  Friends are  friends because they have a bond, yet they are not whole concerned with the  other.  They are comrades, and do things side by side. Lovers are intensely  interested in the others, looking at each other, not working side by side.  This is illustrated in Orual's relationship with Bardia.  Bardia, a prime  solider, is a close friend of her, and the closest to a sexual relationship  she ever obtained.  Yet he is married, and so Orual cannot know erotic love  as did Redival and Psyche.  She is friends with him, and will not destroy  his family.  In this way, God is helping her to the point where she will  drop the veil and let him put a face on her.  Through the course of the  years, she is showing more character in her relationship with Bardia than  in her relationship with Psyche.  She will not destroy the man she loves  although she did destroy her sister's happiness.  Already God was gently  prodding her to a more real and honest place with him.<br />.<br />.<br />-----<br />[The above text is a revised version of a review written in 2000.

Amazon took it upon themselves to drastically cut the text in half.  I emailed Amazon back then and got the full text released.  This is the first time the artificially shortened version of my \\"Till We Have Faces\\" review has appeared online in over a decade.  Mike London 10-24-2012]<br /><br />TILL WE HAVE FACES, is, simply put, one of the most beautifulbooks I have read. Its depths are enormous, its truth fantastically illustrated, and the author is completely given over to the character. If you are reading this for Lewis's style, don't. In an amazing feat of creation, Lewis used his God-given gift, and has completely come into Orual's mind. This is some of the best characterization I have ever read. It was like Lewis completely laid down his own style, and yielded to that or Orual. Although that may be disquieting to some, it reveals the true creative power God gave that fine Christian brother. He immerses us into her world, told from her eyes. The book is very, very deep, demanding several rereadings.<br /><br />The plot of the book is a daughter is born to a king, named Psyche. He already has two other daughters, Orual and Redival. Her older sister, Orual, becomes very loving of her. Yet this love is exactly what it ought not to be: a selfish love. Psyche, seemingly a goddess in the eyes of the people, must be taken to sacrifice to the god of the grey mountains....The book is about how she [Psyche] moves away from that selfish love and into the love of Jesus Christ...Psyche is the mostly Godly character, full of selfless love for others. It is she that is Orual's love. There is much to learn from Psyche.<br /><br />In this book, we have what Lewis wrote in his nonfiction The Four Loves. These were written and published about the same time, and he had met Joy Davidman, who was to be his wife. Erotic love, that had so long passed him by, had suddenly and out of nowhere appeared on his doorstep. So love weight heavily on his mind during this period of his life. To have a deeper appreciation of this book, read both this and his The Four Loves, because basically he tackled the same subject in two separate genres: fiction and nonfiction.

Out of these type of activities grew his masterpiece - THE LORD OF THE RINGS.  He wrote these stories for his children, whilst involved with the more serious work  of his mythology.  But the culmination of his children's fiction - THE  HOBBIT, was so successful that it was published and Unwin wanted a  sequel.<br />That said, these letters are good, and on the same quality as  ROVERANDOM and FARMER GILES.  Both of those are abundant in word play.   These are fascinating, and good holiday stories.  The chief complaint I  have with these are they were not all published.  As I understand it, some  of the letters that are published are lacking the entire letter.  However,  the selection of 1925 to 1939, although for some reason it seems I read it  continued on to 1945.  That might be in error.  The letter in 1920, only a  note, is included in facsimile, but for some reason the letters of 1921 to  1924 are missing.  A severe misfortune.  However, if you are looking for  light holiday fare (all of his children's fiction is light fare, with the  possible exception of THE HOBBIT), this is the place for it.  Afterward,  read ROVERANDOM and FARMER GILES OF HAM.  Narnia is better than both, of  course.	2000-05-16
US	50704475	RTKOUQG60WV5G	0877883912	876969356	Images of Salvation in the Fiction of C. S. Lewis	Books	3	5	5	N	N	Fair Fare, but there's better out there	This book has some good truths in it, and helps a reader have a better understanding of what Lewis was doing with his fiction.  Its greatest weakness is that it is not entirely devoted to bringing out the truth in an expository way.  Instead of assuming the reader has a general knowledge of  the story (which is no crime in a critical work), Kilby summarizes the  novels, and then in a numbered list goes into the points of truth.  To me,  I don't like this.  Half of the book is summary of the stories.  It would  better aid the general reader had it all been insights into his fiction,  instead of summarizing for the first half (or more) of each chapter,  dealing with on whatever particular novel he is talking about....<br />Kilby obviously has good insight into Lewis's fiction - if only he  would have devoted more of the book to it.  Kilby does bring out some good  points.    However, a much better book (although it only deals with Lewis's  Space Trilogy) is David C. Downing's PLANETS IN PERIL.  That is a shining  example of what a critical book should be like.  I highly recommend it.	2000-05-16
US	50704475	R27UT6UXTJA9HH	067973225X	161451712	As I Lay Dying: The Corrected Text	Books	5	9	13	N	N	Dark Comedy and Psychological Realism	I just got thru reading As I Lay Dying for a college class.  As I have read no other Faulkner, I cannot compare this with his other works.  Although it takes time to get adjusted to it, the novel itself is grand, a  tour de force as Faulkner called it.  The family experiences Addie's  loss.<br />Each character is fully realized, and every last one of them (in  the family, anyway) is insane.  Jewel is constantly cursing and using  violence to express his love and anger.  This is in direct relationship  with his mother, because she did so with him.  The very thing that defines  him is when he calls his horse &quot;You sweet son of a b----&quot;.  That  he how he relates to the world.  He is a very angry young man, and cannot  express himself properly without resorting to foul language.<br />Darl is a  very interesting character.  Although you may not catch it less you are  paying attention, he has a telepathic ability, to read into people's mind.  He is very perceptive.  So perceptive, in fact, that in one chapter in the  first part he describes what is happening at the house as Addie Bundren  dies, and he and Jewel are away from the house selling materials.  His  relationship with Addie is strained at best.  She loves Jewel best.  In  manner of speech, Addie and Darl are closest, being very poetic in  speech.<br />Cash is 28/29 and Vardaman's age isn't given.  He is a little  boy.  Cash makes the casket for his mother.  Vardaman becomes very confused  during the duration of the novel, because he catches a fish in the  beginning.  The fish dies and they eat it (this is a correlation of the  family being like buzzards during the journey).  One chapter consists of a  single sentence.  &quot;My mother is a fish&quot;.  It is also  foreshadowing of one of the more comic events in the novel.  Darl says of  Jewel, whose relationship with his horse is based after his relationship  with his mother, that his mother is a horse, speaking metaphorically.  Vardaman takes that literally also.  If Jewel's mother can be a horse, he  insists his mother can be a fish.<br />Tull is the only sane one in the story,  and he is not a member of the family.  He is a neighbour who is helping  with the family.  Cora, his wife, serves God in a cliche way, and is  generally niave.  Brother Whitaker, without revealing too much of the plot,  is important.  Anse, the father, is hilarious.  He says he cannot sweat  because of some illness he got when he was 20.  He won't do a damn thing.  He won't be &quot;beholden&quot; to any man, which he says all the time.  But he really doesn't want to do anything, and wants others to do it for  him.<br />Dewey Dell is a very simple creature.  She gets pregnant, and wants  to have an abortion.  She doesn't understand morality.  Her intellect pales  in comparison to Darl's; however, they have a psychic link together.  Someone like this God would not judge harshly, because she does not have  understanding.<br />Addie Bundren in the single most important character in  the novel.  Her chapter is a little past the center of the novel.  The  reason, one interpretation goes, is that Addie is like the spoke of a  wheel, where the spoke is in the center, and everything is connected to it  and comes out of it.  She is a very hateful person.  Although very poetic,  she hates words, thinking them meaningless.<br />Sex to the Bundren family is  not governed by morality (or at least they don't think it is). My teacher  likened it to barnyard sex: animals are not governed by morality, and they  just have sex.  This is much the approach of this family, although of  course they are wrong.  Man is above animals, and morality governs this  matter.  Dewey Dell, of which much of the imagery associated with her is  sexual, is very simple and knows nothing of sexual morality.  Her name  suggests her simpleton sexuality.  Dewey Dell means &quot;Moist  Valley&quot;.  Not to much of a stretch of an imagination to know what that  means.  She gets pregnant by Lafe.  Dewey Dell is such of limited  intelligence that she goes to the pharmacy at the end of the novel to get  an abortion.  The soda jerk tells her to come back, and then he has sex  with her.  She curses afterward, saying that won't cure anything.  Darl and  Cash masturbated while growing up.  Addie is still lonely even though she  has sexual relations with her husband, so goes elsewhere to find it.  (Her  children were there to cure her loneliness.  An important lesson is lurking  here: sex and children are two of the most precious gifts from God: they  are exactly that - gifts.  One must know Christ to have a truly fulfilled  life).<br />Dark humour is very prevalent thruout the entire novel.  Everything from Addie making her water trip to Anse getting those teeth to  them dragging the body, stinking up everything, the novel is hilarious.  Anse says he owes it to Addie to take her there, saying he won't disgrace  her.  Yet the whole journey is disgraceful.  It is one of the funniest  books in a dark sense that I have read in a long time.  To speak to much of  this would ruin some of the moments; but rest assured, if you properly  imagine the events, it should strike you quite funny.<br />In conclusion,  Faulkner has created a portrait dysfunctional family.  He said he wrote  this, and knew if he never picked up a pen again he would live or die  (reputation wise) by this book.  (Quote paraphrased)  He also does his  stream of conscious and multiple narrators, making this foray notable  because of it.  Each is fully drawn, with excellent psychological realism.  The characterization is excellent.  Read it.	2000-05-15

This is much more a portrait of the man than a critical assessment of the then unpublished Silmarillion.  Kilby states he didn't believe it will be completed.  That  turned out to be true.  There was a chapter Kilby wrote for the book, but  it was cut because Christopher Tolkien thought it gave away to much plot of  the book, and Kilby, wanting to maintain cordial relations with the family,  abided by Christopher's wishes.  This book probably had a short publication  life, mainly because it was published in 1976, and The Silmarillion was  published in 1977.  This was mainly cashing in on the anticipation of The  Silmarillion.  So if you buy this expecting a critical work of The  Silmarillion, don't buy it.  If you are looking for a charming, thin book  on Tolkien, buy it.<br />Not, by any means, that it is a bad book.  A very  notable feature is it also talked about the then unpublished C. S. Lewis  short story about a man born blind and then getting his eyesight back by  surgery, he doesn't understand the concept of light, thinking it a solid  substance.  It sounds something of a tribute to MacDonald's musing on  lights as emphasized in his faerie tales.  Or perhaps it was insipiered by  that (I just reread his short tale of Nysteris and Photogen in The Day Boy  and the Night Girl).  It is different than the story in some respects, and  Hooper felt that Tolkien probably was told a version and had not read the  story.  The story is &quot;The Man Born Blind&quot; in THE DARK TOWER AND  OTHER STORIES.  This book also has contains comments on Smith of Wootten  Major.  It is a good source of information, and a charming book in its own  right.  It provides a &quot;distant glimpse of that promised work&quot;,  referring to The Silmarillion, as the blurb would put it.  If you are a  Tolkien admirer, it is worth a read	2000-05-12
US	50704475	R14AYVQ2FZXAWH	0064471195	607344832	The Chronicles of Narnia Boxed Set	Books	5	222	239	N	N	A Question of Order: On the Reading of Narnia	With two publication orders of Narnia, many people question which to read.  For several reasons, I recommend the first publication order to be read first, the internal chronology second..<br /><br />If one reads the history of Narnia as strictly that, one is much more likely to lose the truths Lewis  was trying to impart.  When one reads The Lion, if they had not read  Magician's Nephew, they will be unaware of where the Lamp-Post came.  Lion  is essential a story about Edmond coming into the salvation of God.  It  creates a real sense of wonder, a wonder that would be diluted with  knowledge of its creation.  It's a mystery, an account.  You become less  concerned with the book in context of the whole series, and more concerned  with the book in context of the book.  Some things you might miss or not  pay much attention to because you have already taken into account in  context of the story's chronology, and not examined what Lewis was trying  to say through this.  Also, you get to follow the characters throughout the  books, which is lost in the new order.  The four Pevensies are in Books I  and II, then only the two younger are in III, along with a new character, a  cousin named Eustace.  Then They can no longer go on, and Eustace and Jill  Pole is in Book IV.  This is lost in the new order.  Also, you can see  Lewis's growth as a writer, getting more and more realistic in  characterization as each book was written.  Of course, when he was writing  these he was already a phenomenal writer: but this provided room for more  growth, and he developed his already great gift even more so.<br /><br />Also, as  Paul Ford points out in his excellent Companion to Narnia, the old order is  reflective of Biblical history.  God's people are in bondage to the  Egyptians, and he frees them.  But the wine and groan, and in the end many  die in the wilderness.  Then they go into Babylon, and hear all these  creation stories.  After this, they go and record their own history.  Lewis, after trying to write a creation story, found he could not, and went  on telling other stories of Narnia.  Only after coming more and more into  the spirit of the series, after a good deal of history had been written,  could he go back and finish Magician. To quote the preface, Ford says the  original order allows \\"the reader to experience something experience  something truer than even Lewis intended: the primordial necessity of  passing first thru redemption, then into a reinterpretation of one's own  story, and finally allowing the future to take its providence course\\".  And how true that is.  How many times can one understand what God is doing  in your life until you come to know him?  When you come to the salvation  and knowledge of Christ, after some time elapses you can go back and  examine your life, and can see where God's hand was on you, guiding you to  that place where you met Christ.  And in so doing, you come to trust God in  a deeper sense, and as he took care of your past, he will also take care of  your future.  Of course, this was not intentional on Lewis's part, but it  shows when God gives someone a gift, that person can reach people in such a  way as to be totally beyond the person, and directly pointing to God.  This  aspect truly points to Jesus Christ and the \\"great Emperor Beyond the  Sea,\\".<br /><br />Of course, there is a balance.  They are stories, and  should be enjoyed as such.  Through these stories, Lewis gives children and  adults alike truth.  However, if you overanalyze them, you are losing the  spirit of the series.  One must first enjoy them as stories, and not go  dissecting them without reading them simply for stories.  That is why the  chronological order also has its merits.  Ironically, however, it is better  balanced to read it in original order for reasons cited above, also because  you can take each story on its own, appreciating both the story and the  symbolism.  Without the interconnecting theme of history behind it, you are  forced to look more at what the story is and what it is saying as to what  the Chronicles is saying as a whole.  That is one side.  That is not  balanced.  Then, go back and read the stories in chronological order.  That  makes you appreciate the series as a whole.<br /><br />In conclusion, each has its  merits, and without each it they are not balanced.  But for first time  readers, read it in the original order.  You will get more out of it.  That  is the most balanced way to read and appreciate the stories.  Afterward, go  back and read in chronological order.  Then you will have a balanced and  complete view of Lewis's fabulous and God-given Chronicles of Narnia.ore at what the story is and what it is saying as to what  the Chronicles is saying as a whole.  That is one side.  That is not  balanced.  Then, go back and read the stories in chronological order.  That  makes you appreciate the series as a whole.

US	50704475	RJBKE9ZMJR3TJ	0671035711	78879827	My Teacher Is an Alien: Collector's Edition	Books	5	51	57	N	N	A Most Excellent Series	A truly great series.  I first read it was I was probably 11 or 12 (which is the target-audience).  I loved them.  I have read them probably 5 or 6 times.  Coville is an excellent writer; this is one of his crowning  achievements in children's literature.  Now I am twenty.  I  pulled out my old dusty copies of these works, and as soon as I finish Hunt  for the Autumn Clowns I'm going to take a quick trip down memory lane with  this serious (before I tackle the Potter books and R. Jordan).<br /><br />This is a  very well-constructed series.  The first book is an absolute classic.  Although the others are excellent, just like Lion, Witch, Wardrobe this  will be the one everyone thinks of when they think of the series.  It has  classic elements of an alien trying to kidnap people to do experiments and  testing on.  Save in this (if I remember correctly) you don't know WHY he  wants the people, or kids.<br /><br />Then we go to the second, My Teacher Fried My  Brains.  A very lovable sequel, it is here we get into the mind of Duncan  Dougal, the bully in the first book.  We find \\"poots\\", a  Medusa-like alien, and machine that makes you perceive music/TV in yr head  and makes you a zillion times smarter (the zillion being a rough estimate,  of course ;)).  And it seems, perhaps, there is something more to the  aliens then at first they thought.  Won't give any spoilers away, so don't  worry.  But there is a nice little surprise at the end.<br /><br />Then we get to the  third volume, My Teacher Glows in the Dark.  My personal favorite, it's set  on the spaceship New Jersey.  It introduced all sorts of nice imagery, and  concepts I have used in my own writings (The URAT.  Surgically installed  device, so you can understand the other creatures on board.  Though not by  device, I have used similar methods to cross over the language barrier when  I want to have different species get together in my own stories for any  suspended period of time).  We get to meet the lovable Hoo-Lan, who is  quite the doll.  It is set entirely on the ship (with the exception of an  instance where they go onto another planet), as state up above, so we get  to see fascinating alien environments.<br /><br />Then we get to the fourth, My  Teacher Flunked the Planet.  It is here the series as a whole climaxes.  It  is the darkest story of the lot, primarily because of its subject matter is  a lot denser and much more real in the sense of tragedy than the other  three stories.  The others build up to this moment.  From a writer's  standpoint, this is a most excellent case or instance of carefully crafted  and wrought stories for children.  It is here Coville ties up the loose  ends (and there are quite a few).  The ending is a very interesting concept  or perception of humanity.  Although I am a Christian, and I do not agree  with the whole evolution idea, for the sake of the story it worked.  It is  much more of a sentimental favorite for me, because I grew up reading (and  reading and reading and reading) these four volumes.<br /><br />As I said, my  personal favorite is the third story.  The only problem with this one is  it is heavily dependent on the others three books to carry the story.  My  Teacher is an Alien, which was never intended for a series, is the most  stand alone of all the books.  It has the most distinct feel of a modern  children's classic.* But, unlike The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe (for  me), this is as good as the rest of them.  Then the publishers wanted more  because it turned out to be an unexpected hit.  So he wrote the second.  It  is stand alone - to a point.  You can tell there is more coming, and the  issue is not resolved.  Then the third one just exaggerates that feeling.  Its like Act I builds and sets the rules.  It doesn't need another thing to  be complete.  It is complete in sense it is self-contained.  Act II further  complicates Act I, and hints at what is to be in Act III.  But to be  complete, it needs Act III.Act III comes along.<br /><br />Originally, according to  the preface in the Collector's edition, it was supposed to be a trilogy,  but the story was too long, so he divided up into two parts.  Act III in  this instances just builds and intensifies the need for completion.  It  depends on the two acts before it to build up to it, and then it depends on  Act IV to complete it.  Act IV is the completion.  (Much of what I say here  echoes what George Lucas said of Star Wars in the interview released with  them when they rereleased the Star Wars original edition.  ESB is the best  in that series, but, just like Book 2 and 3 in this series, need RoJ to be  completed, and is not a stand alone film).<br /><br />* (When I say a classic  feel, its just like The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe.  All the Narnia  books are classics and are most excellent [scary, now I'm sounding like  Bill and Ted - yike!], but LWW has the most classic feel of them all, and,  btw, is my least favorite of the series.  It has some classic scenes,  especially Tumnus the Faun standing in the wood with parcels and an  umbrella.  But overall, the Christianity is way too explicit.  I like, if  you are using fantasy as a vehicle to express Christianity, not to be beat  over the head with it, which is what I feel Lewis did with Aslan and the  Stone Table.  I love Narnia, and LWW is good, but the others are so MUCH  better!)<br /><br />Narnia is better than this, and most children's fiction for that  matter.	2000-04-12
US	50704475	R1RADBL2TIKMQF	0618002219	669379389	The Hobbit: or There and Back Again	Books	5	89	109	N	N	Inferiour to L.R.? I think not!  No, just different!	The biggest problem with this novel is perception.  Tolkien wrote this story for children; to be more specific, this was written for HIS children.  There were several stories like this, but it was this, The Hobbit, that  was his master achievement in children's literature.<br /><br />The Lord of the  Rings ( a single epic, NOT a trilogy) was written to cash in on The  Hobbit's success.  Tolkien wanted to get on with the more serious work of  his mythology, and ultimately that is what happened with The Lord of the  Rings.  It became attached to his mythology, and became as important to him  as The Silmarillion.<br /><br />So delineation is required if you want to read  this.  Do not go in with the thought that The Hobbit is a \\"precursor\\" or  any such nonsense to The Lord of the Rings.  Think of it like you would  think of any other children's classics: children's classics.  If you take  it on The L. R.'s terms, this is a failure, primary because it is not  written to be like that.  But, on the flipside, The L. R. is as much a  failure in children's fiction.  It is not children's fiction, it is epic  fantasy, and one should not equate it with children's fiction.  That is  EXACTLY what people try to do with The Hobbit.  They try to put it in the  same type of genre or playing field as The L. R.  They are both  masterpieces, and I love them both dearly.  But one is for children, the  other with adults.<br /><br />Of course, Tolkien is part of the problem.  How many  books do you know that is a children's book and has an adult sequel?  Not  very many.  The Hobbit, scarcely 300 pages, was written and published in  the children's market.  He then talked to his publishers, and they wanted a  sequel.  So he began \\"the new Hobbit\\", as C. S. (Jack) Lewis so aptly put  it.  He was preoccupied with his mythology, and the sequel was drawn into  it.  So we have two works, spanning two different genres, and as far as  surface connections go its little more than prequel/sequel.  Instead of  looking at The Hobbit as a prequel, a precursor to his ADULT masterpiece,  an inferiour version, think of as his CHILDREN'S masterpiece.  The Hobbit  is top of the class in children's fiction, one of the few contenders  against such other great children's works as Narnia and Wrinkle in Time.  The Lord of the Rings, likewise, is THE crowning masterpiece of the fantasy  genre, of which its influence is incalculable to that fantasy market.  Both  are as important as the other, just in different fields.<br /><br />I haven't  talked about The Silmarillion much.  I have already reviewed it, so I won't  go real in-depth here.  But the same thing happened with it.  People,  expecting another Lord of the Rings, were inevitably disappointed with the  Biblical style of the published version.  If Tolkien wrote that book out in  narrative form as he did Lord of the Rings, it would be ten times longer  than Lord of the Rings.  The biggest problem with Tolkien is people have to  many preconceptions that are incorrect.<br /><br />So, basically, in conclusion,  think of it like this:<br /><br />1.  The Hobbit - Children's masterpiece.  He  scores big with this one.<br /><br />2.  The Lord of the Rings - a single fantasy,  not a trilogy.  (Tolkien was always quick to point that out).

I certianly have!<br /><br />Mike London]tead of  looking at The Hobbit as a prequel, a precursor to his ADULT masterpiece,  an inferiour version, think of as his CHILDREN'S masterpiece.  The Hobbit  is top of the class in children's fiction, one of the few contenders  against such other great children's works as Narnia and Wrinkle in Time.  The Lord of the Rings, likewise, is THE crowning masterpiece of the fantasy  genre, of which its influence is incalculable to that fantasy market.  Both  are as important as the other, just in different fields.<br /><br />I haven't  talked about The Silmarillion much.  I have already reviewed it, so I won't  go real in-depth here.  But the same thing happened with it.  People,  expecting another Lord of the Rings, were inevitably disappointed with the  Biblical style of the published version.  If Tolkien wrote that book out in  narrative form as he did Lord of the Rings, it would be ten times longer  than Lord of the Rings.  The biggest problem with Tolkien is people have to  many preconceptions that are incorrect.<br /><br />So, basically, in conclusion,  think of it like this:<br /><br />1.  The Hobbit - Children's masterpiece.  He  scores big with this one.<br /><br />2.  The Lord of the Rings - a single fantasy,  not a trilogy.  (Tolkien was always quick to point that out).  The Crowning  achievement of modern fantasy.<br /><br />3.  The Silmarillion - the Bible of  Middle-earth.

In April 2000, I wrote three Narnia reviews covering \\"The Last Battle\\", \\"The Silver Chair\\", and \\"The Magician's Nephew\\". However, I only completed and published \\"The Last Battle\\" review at that time.  In September 2001, I wrote a second review that went unpublished until October 2012. Review 1 is the April 2000 review.  Review 2 is the previously unpublished 2001 review]<br /><br />Review 1:  Apocalyptic fiction has become a fashionable trend in the Christian market nowadays.  Yet this book, published in 1957, proves one thing: Lewis was years ahead of his time.  Although Jenkins and LaHaye are doing good  detailing their fictional account of the end-of-the-world (Left Behind  series), in what is taking them hundreds of pages, Lewis does in a short  200.  Not that that is a bad thing, because each had different purposes.  Since I'm reviewing Narnia, Narnia I will stay with.<br /><br />Lewis, in his only  end-of-the-world book, tells of how in the last days of Narnia, there are  two animals living by the Great Cauldron.  One is Puzzle, a lovable Donkey,  and the other is an evil ape named Shift.  Shift, thru manipulation and  deception, tricks Puzzle into donning a lion skin, making a false Aslan.  This is representative of the Anti-Christ.  It is about how the real  Aslan and the real Tash come again into Narnia, and the final show down.<br /><br />The most stirringly majestic portion of the whole book is the last part,  where the old Narnia passes away, and behold! the children and all good  Narnians who love Aslan are called into Heaven, the New Narnia.  This is  the single most precious portion of any of Lewis's fiction.  It drips of  Heaven.  The Power and Majesty of God on High is portrayed thru these  pages.  He goes thru judgement day (never mind this pre-mid-post trib stuff  or debate), and then how the children react to being in heaven.<br /><br />An  interesting concept put forth by this book is a LIMITED universalism.  Emeth, who is servant of Tash, a pagan god, is found in heaven.  When Aslan  comes and speaks to him, Emeth says he was not servant of Aslan but Tash.  Aslan says that in reality he had been serving Aslan all along, and he knew  Aslan, but to him Aslan was known as Tash.  In other words, Emeth's  perception or view was not the real Tash, who was an evil being, but the  real Aslan.  To an extent, I agree that this might be possible.  I feel you  can have a relationship with Jesus, but know him under a different name.  That does NOT mean I believe all religions send you to heaven.  You still  have to know Jesus, and God.<br /><br />The dwarves, who are in heaven, are to  stubborn to let got of themselves.  They perceive themselves in a horse  stall (that is where the last of old Narnia is seen.  It is night, and all  these people in a great circle or waiting for Tashlan, which is the fusing  of Tash and Aslan, exactly what the Anti-Christ is, and the children run  into the tent or stall.)  \\"The Dwarves are for the Dwarves!\\"  This is  pride.  This is what it is like on earth.  What to us seems distasteful, if  we would really let go of our pride and let God be God, then in the end we  would have ultimate joy.  That is what Lewis is saying thru the Dwarves.<br /><br />Lewis also uses classical philosophy to educate children.  The old  Narnia is called the Shadowlands, mere shadows of the More Real Heaven.  This is straight from Plato.  The values we hold dear, such as truth,  valour, honour, etc, are manifestations of its essence.  We practice truth  and valour.  That is a form of valour, a shadow.  But the essence of  valour, that is the real thing itself.  Lewis uses this concept to help the  Children better understand God.  I came across this in this story when I  was a child; I was astounded to realize it was Plato when I was in a  philosophy class in college.  That is why, in being a Christian, the more  you act like the Christ the more Christ is in you and part ofyou.  The  more honour you show and love you show, the more Christ is you and you are  him because Christ is the very ultimate of honour, and all the other  vitures we hold dear.  That is why God gave us the shadow of marriage, to  help us understand the very real union between God and man.  We become one  with God, just as man and woman become one flesh in sexual intercourse.  God is such an awesome God.<br /><br />In the end, we have a powerful vision of  Heaven.  Although it is Narnia, the ending he detailed was as much our  world as Narnia.  His prose is fantastic.  As far as C. S. Lewis's \\"Mere  Christianity\\" coming out in his fiction, this is his ultimate achievement  in giving hope to the Christians on the afterlife.  This is my favorite  (from the Christian perspective) of the Narnia series.  There is so much to  learn and digest from this beautiful book.  The heart of this achievement  is that this is written for Children, and yet he packs so much meat into it  without EVER coming across as condescending OR preachy.  Truly one of the  best.<br /><br />(For adult fiction, Till We Have Faces is his best.  Actually, I  think that novel is his deepest novel, and his best).<br />-------------------------------------<br />Review 2:  The Last Battle, the very last book in the Narnian Chronicles, also stands as the most impressive book in the series as far as the religious aspect goes. It also shows what LWW could have been had Lewis handled it properly. Lewis infuses Christian ideology with fantasy for fantastic results, and the result is a book that stands as one of the most beautiful things he ever wrote. There is no other prose from Lewis's hand that equals the last sections of The Last Battle and the first sections of Perelandra in terms of sheer beauty and joy.<br /><br />In my own life The Last Battle has proven to be very significant because of Lewis's utilization of the Platonic concepts. I did not know it was Plato when I read Lewis, but when I took a philosophy class everything clicked, and I consider myself a Platonic Christian. This is Lewis's prime aim in all seven books of The Chronicles of Narnia. Lewis wants to provide, in story form, truths that, because he has sown the seed, when later encountered in adult life the children will be much more sympathetic to them than they may otherwise be.<br /><br />Another important theme running through The Last Battle is the use of perception, and although we see it numerous times in the books we see it here the most. Those who cannot see the things of God blind themselves to it because of their own spiritual problems, and the people will not let go of their own sin to lead the life God wants them to lead. In The Great Divorce, this is the central theme of the book. People go on a bus ride to heaven, and if they wish to stay, they must give up a vice that they have retained. Only one makes the leap of faith and lets go of his red dragon, which symbolises lust. In The Last Battle, the dwarfs will not let themselves see the true beauty they would be in if they just allowed themselves the opportunity to see it.<br /><br />Another thing about The Last Battle that troubles me is the presentation of Emeth. I have been undecided on Universalism as Lewis presents it. To be a radical Universalist would simply not do, and Lewis was not. I see the point he makes, and there is a side of me that really wants to believe what he has to say on Emeth, but another side of me balks at the idea. I personally would never advocate this view simply because I simply don't know if it is true or not, and as we are talking about eternity here it is not something to play around with. However, I do think this is a possibility and half the time I believe it and the other half I don't, so I simply remain undecided.<br /><br />The events at the stable are very significant for all parties concerned, for it seemed the side aligning themselves with evil are now suddenly shocked to see supernatural occurrences begin, while the animals who are afraid of Tashlan are just all the more certain that he is really angry with them, but for the truly saved are hopeful. Ginger the cat is made into a dumb animal, which really scares the bad side. Rishda Tarkaan becomes terrified to realise the god he has been serving actually does exist. Emeth rejoices, for he will be able to at long last meet his love, which is Tash.<br /><br />The children and Tirian do not fully realise what is in the stable, but they want to know. Tirian grabs Rishda and goes into the stable with him. Tirian has a very surprised reaction, for the Stable is much bigger on the inside than it is on the outside. This goes into the Platonic concept of the inside being bigger than the outside, and Lucy makes the remark that once in her world a stable held someone (Jesus) who was bigger than the entire world. Then the end of Narnia comes and every one goes through that stable door, which, because of its Biblical allusions, is a very approriate door to have to travel through. Either you accept Jesus or you don't, but everyone will know Christ is Lord. That, to me, is what the true significance of the Stable Door is.<br /><br />.<br />.<br />[This is a brief paper I wrote about how Lewis imparted truth to his characters and am including the text here as bonus content to the review proper:]<br /><br />Lewis has his characters experience truth in a number of ways. The four works this essay will look at are \\"The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe\\", \\"Prince Caspian\\", \\"The Voyage of the Dawn Treader\\", and \\"The Last Battle\\". Not all of the truth the characters encounter are what the characters wanted.<br /><br />In the first book, LWW, we have Edmond who has become a traitor. Edmond does not wish to believe that the Witch is bad, because she can supply his fix. This is one of the biggest truths that Lewis imparts to his young readers: addiction blinds you to the point of where your only god is the addiction itself and youwill do anything it takes to get whatever you are addicted too. Edmond is a classic case of addiction, and if this were a work for adults it would have been quite appropriate to make his addiction drugs. When the Beavers are discussing Aslan, Edmond does not like the conversation. He feels this could pose a threat to getting his fix of Turkish Delight. Like drugs, this addiction ruins ordinary pleasures, and Lewis says at the beginning of Chapter IX that memories of bad magic food spoils the taste of regular food. He is so focused on his addictions that Edmond no longer cares about real life, and he will do anything possible to get it, even selling out his brother and sisters to the White Witch, which in everyday life could be a man who will let his family go hungry or will not pay the rent because he cannot get his cocain if he takes care of the basic needs of his family. Even in this degraded state of mind, Edmond gets a realisation of the cruelty of the White Witch, for what he craves the most she will not give him. For truth to come to Edmond, he must accept this terrible fact of his being a traitor and Aslan must die for him. Aslan and Edmond have a talk afterward, which, although we are not told what is said, Lewis does tell us that Edmond never forgot that conversation and he is truly a changed boy.<br /><br />In Prince Caspian, Lewis gives us another boy who is struggling to discover truth. Caspian learns from his Nurse that there is an older Narnia where Talking Animals lived and there were dwarfs and tree and water people and various creatures who claimed Narnia has their home. His Uncle Miraz, however, denies this and sends his nurse away to be replaced by a Dr. Cornelius, who, as it turns out, is a half breed of dwarf and man. It is notable that he is the only named example of interbreeding, although, according to Ford, Caspian's nurse may also have dwarf blood in her. Caspian must decide which \\"truth\\" he will believe, and because of his relatively goodsense he chooses to belief the stories about Old Narnia. This ties into Lewis's theme about the longing for the truth. I highly doubt that, if a person is on Aslan's side (although Caspian is not to begin with), he/she will long for something in a deep spiritual sense and it not be the truth. Lewis talks of this in his Pilgrim's Regress, and it is God's prime instrument in conversion. People long for something true, and unless they are deceived by Satan, they will find their answer in Jesus Christ. It is also important to note the relationship between Dr. Cornelius and Prince Caspian. God wants to use you to help awake and feed that desire for God in someone else's life, and that is why He tells us to go make disciples of men. One reason Lewis chose Dr. Cornelius as a half breed is to illustrate we are not to perfection yet, but we are progressing toward it, and also one reason the dwarfs intermarried was so the were not killed. Sometimes, as Christians, we cannot be open about our religion but must seek God to know who we should share it with. Of course, this does not apply to America yet, for we have tremendous religious freedom. As the world progresses, however, I fear that will change. Once you discover truth, then you are accountable to that truth and must help fight for it, which Prince Caspian does, and then becomes King Caspian.<br /><br />Eustace Scrubb also encounters truth for the first time. Much of the first half of the novel Eustace is a perfect ass.<br />Jill also encounters truth in The Silver Chair. At the opening of the novel, she learns the appropriate ways to approach God, and these ways are not Satanic, as the dark magic she suggested to Eustace as a method of getting into Narnia was. She also learns in that opening scene with her and Aslan more of the nature of God. You cannot put God in a box, and Aslan will make no promises to her what he will do, but she does not doubt his word when the Lion tells her that there is no other stream. Throughout there rest of the novel Jill learns that no matter what God says, you must do as he asks, even if it seems that you will be killed or seriously harmed or seemingly impossible, and she also learns that, through the giants of Harfang, God will take care of you even if you err, but there will be unnecessary complictions if you do not do it his way.<br /><br />Perhaps the most interesting of all, and certainly rather an anomoly as mostly the examples given are good characters becoming better, but in The Last Battle we have one of the central bad guys learn that there really are supernatural forces, even though he did not believe in them. Farsight, the Eagle, notices that Rishda Tarkaan is very surprised about what is in the stable and of Shift's destruction. His discovery of the truth, however, is horrific. Tash, the god he has called on but does not believe, has come to gather his lawful prey, and Rishda is shocked that Tash even exists. Lewis uses this character to illustrate to his readers that you should be careful in what type of belief system you invoke, for the worship of Tash was a cultural practice that Rishda practice not in belief but because it the culture, and he really does not believe in anything.<br /><br />These are some examples of the numerous ways in which truth comes to Narnian characters.<br /><br />[Throughout the years, I have written a number of reviews that have never been published online on Amazon. These writings comprise two types of reviews: unfinished reviews, abandoned during various stages of composition, and completed reviews that for life reasons were never posted. Of the later type, back in September 2001 I wrote a cache of work, a full sixteen reviews of several different C. S. Lewis books which have never been released. I am publishing these reviews now for the first time, over a decade after they were initially written.

In 2012 I wrote a new review, and am editing my original text to include this new review.  Mike London 10-3-2012]<br /><br />New Review 2012: \\"In a hole in the ground, there lived a hobbit.\\"  Thus begins the most famous series in fantasy literature.  For such a universe of high caliber, the sentence is a rather unassuming beginning for quite an unassuming, down-to-earth race known as Hobbits.<br /><br />Unfortunately \\"The Hobbit\\" has become overshadowed by \\"The Lord of the Rings\\", seen as an \\"enchanting prelude\\" to the more substantial sequel.  C. S. Lewis said in \\"[[ASIN:0195003454 A Preface to Paradise Lost]]\\" that to accurately judge an item, you first must know its purpose.  The books were written for different purposes - \\"The Hobbit\\" as an entertaining story for his children, and \\"The Lord of the Rings\\", initially a sequel to \\"The Hobbit\\", became much more a continuation of \\"The Silmarillion\\".  For those who underestimate \\"The Hobbit\\" using the criteria of \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" as their guide are missing out on a rich work.<br /><br />What are Hobbits, you may ask?  If you go researching where Tolkien got inspiration for the Hobbits, you will soon get mixed up in \\"The Denham Tracks\\" (a 19th century list of various folk-lore creatures) and E. A. Wyke-Smith's \\"\\"[[ASIN:B00A3KJALC The Marvellous Land of Snergs (Dover Children's Classics)]]\\".  Honestly, neither of these will get you very far.<br /><br />The Denham Tracks reads like a laundry list of folk-lore creatures, and though the actual word \\"hobbit\\" appears, there is no context for what a \\"hobbit\\" actually is.  \\"The Marvelous Land of the Snergs\\" will get you a tad bit further.  Snergs are creatures about half the height of man (like the Hobbits), enjoy their food (again, like the Hobbits), and there the resemblance ends.  The World of the Snergs is far removed from Middle-earth, having more to do with 19th century adventure stories set in fantasy with such dispargant elements as a vegetation Troll (by far the best character in the book), witches, knights similiar to stories of King Arthur, ad a waylaid sea crew hailing from the ship \\"The Flying Dutchman\\"<br /><br />Tolkien certainly anticipated the question, for he answered this inquiry within the opening pages of this very book.  They are a race two to four feet high, shy of \\"Big People\\", and have no beards, unlike dwarves.  Hobbits are chubby, \\"dress in bright colours, (chiefly green and yellow)\\", and wear no shoes because of the hick tufts of hair and thick leathery soles of their feet. They eat as often as they can.<br /><br />The story of \\"The Hobbit\\" is well known, having been published in 1937 and continually in print (save only for a brief interruption in the early 1940s, when Great Britian were facing paper shortages due to World War II).<br /><br />\\"The Hobbit\\" began life as an entertaining story of Tolkien's children (as so many of Tolkien's stories began as well).  Written between 1929-1933, the book details the adventures of Bilbo Baggins.  Gandalf the Wizard meets with Bilbo in the opening pages, telling him he is looking for some \\"to go on an adventure\\".  Bilbo, not quite as respectible as he would like to believe himself to be, tells Gandalf life was much more interesting when Gandalf was around, but no, he would not have any adventures, thank you very much.  Naturally, thirteen dwarves show up, and ultimately Bilbo sets off to reclaim the gold that the Dragon Smaug has stolen from the dwarves.  Like the later Aragorn, Thorin Oakenshield, the chief dwarf, is a king-in-exile, and wants to reclaim both his throne and his gold stolen by the dragon..<br /><br />The real meat of \\"The Hobbit\\", and one of the reasons why I believe the book has had such a long lasting appeal, is the book's transformation of Bilbo.<br/><br />\\"The Hobbit\\" shows the reader how an unassuming modern character (for though Bilbo lives in the far removed past, he is THOROUGHLY MODERN) goes from being an out-of-place bumbler in situations far removed from his life experience to an equal among beings and races that belong only in the distant past.<br /><br />Although initially inept, Bilbo, just as Gandalf predicted, proves to be a worthwhile companion, coming through for the dwarves on several key occasions, such as freeing them from the Elven prisons, fighting back the spiders, and facing the dragon alone.  He even eventually aids in bringing about a resolution to the growing distress between the Dwarves, Men, and Elves after the fallout of Smaug's demise (albeit, rather unconventionally, using the Arkenstone, the Heart of the Mountain and the jewel which Thorin prizes above all others).<br /><br />This journey, this transformation of Bilbo into something more, something greater, is the true heart of the book.  Tolkien himself said that he removed Gandalf from the story shortly after Beorn's house, due to the dramatic need for Bilbo to proove himself without assistance from the wizard.  Fortunately, Tolkien was able to use Gandalf's absence as a springboard into more expansive story ideas when he began developing \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" after the unbridled success of \\"The Hobbit\\".<br /><br />Also, the book displays a moral complexity often not seen within the confines of children's liteature.  By this, I am referring to the whole matter of Bilbo's handling of the Arkenstone, the chief jewel of the hoard that Bilbo and the dwarves are setting out to recover.  The claims of the Elves and Men, and counter claims of the dwarves, and Bilbo's claiming of the Arkenstone and how he wants to use the Arkenstone to move the uprising battle toward resolution are complex and startling legal in tone.<br /><br />For all its story-book qualities, \\"The Hobbit\\" is a much different work from its subsequent heir, \\"The Lord of the Rings\\".  Although early manuscripts explicitly prove Tolkien was casting the \\"The Hobbit\\" in the universe of his mythology from initial composition, \\"The Hobbit\\" features several elements and passages that are altogether incongruous with \\"The Lord of the Rings\\", especially in the First Edition published in 1937.<br /><br />For one, the ring found in Gollum's cave is not the One Ring, the Ruling Ring of Sauron.  The magic ring was simply that - a magic ring, a stage prop that, in the words of Tom Shippey helped equalize Bilbo in the archaic world he found himself in.  Tolkien only began developing the concept of the Ruling Ring AFTER publication of \\"The Hobbit\\" when he was trying to come up with ideas for a sequel.  When reading \\"The Hobbit\\", readers, especially those who know the sequel, may approach the Ring as though this was truly a dark and sinister ring, which the text does not simply support.  Indeed, Bilbo's deception about the ring, so important in \\"The Lord of the Rings\\", is not explicit in \\"The Hobbit\\".<br /><br />Next, and probably most fascinating of all, is the nature of Gollum himself.  We all know he's a hobbit, long ago corrupted by his long possession of the One Ring.  However, prior to 1951 when Allen and Unwin (Tolkien's publishers) published the revised version of \\"Riddles in the Dark\\" that Tolkien had written in 1947, not only was Gollum explicitly NOT a hobbit, we were not even sure what kind of creature he was (or what his physical size was).  He was more akin to Tom Bombadil and Beorn, a one item category unique unto himself.  There were no textual indications of Gollum's size in comparison to Bilbo, leading some illustrators in foreign editions to show Gollum as a much larger creature than he would later become.<br /><br />Then there's the matter of the original version of \\"Riddles in the Dark\\".  Initially Gollum was going to give away his magic ring as a gift if Bilbo won the contest as well as show him the way out; after winning,Gollum is unable to find the ring (naturally, as Bilbo had already found the ring), so he showed Bilbo the way out, constantly apologizing.  In \\"The Return of the Shadow\\", Book Six of \\"The History of Middle-earth\\", we find Tolkien trying to work within the parameters of this original chapter.  Naturally, Tolkien ultimately abandoned the original conception and rewrote the chapter in 1947 as a specimen of what a new chapter could look like and sent this to his publisher.  Tolkien was quite surprised to see that, four years later, Allen & Unwin published the rewritten version, and Tolkien accepted the text as authoritative.<br /><br />While that's the most interesting of the differences, there are still several passages at odds with Middle-earth as described in \\"The Lord of the Rings\\".  There is no Shire.  There are references to policemen and an unnamed \\"king\\".  The trolls fit more into fairy-book stories than Middle-earth, and, as Douglas Anderson points out in \\"The Annotated Hobbit\\", Tolkien references other trolls with multiple heads, a thing not found in Middle-earth.  Then there are the stone giants, which only appear once and then are never heard of again in any other story, before or after.  There is speculation that one of Bilbo's ancestors took a FAIRY wife, a conception wholly alien to Middle-earth.  There are no fairies in Middle-earth.  Then there's the matter of the ruins of the mysterious city upon which Lake-town is built upon.  This ruined city is mentioned only in \\"The Hobbit\\"; it goes unnamed, unreferenced, and undocumented in any of Tolkien's other writings regarding his legendarium.<br /><br />Probably the single biggest difference between \\"The Hobbit\\" and \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" is there is no developed nomenclature in \\"The Hobbit\\".  The majority of the names are simple descriptions of the things involved: Bilbo lives in The Hill, is traveling to the River Running, visits a city named Dale, as neighbors across the Water, etc.  There are very fewproper names in \\"The Hobbit\\".  The thirteen dwarves names and Gandalf (with the exception of \\"Balin\\") are all simply lifted from \\"The Devergatal\\", a section of the Elder Edda  In \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" however, nomenclature is king, and Tolkien spent vast amounts of time creating vast landscape, cultures, and races all with their own unique linguistic flavour.<br /><br />There are also some geographic inconsistencies between the two works.  From the bridge to where Bilbo and the dwarves meet the trolls is within sight; however, in \\"The Lord of the Rings\\", this same spot takes Aragorn and company SIX DAYS to go from the river to the spot where the trolls are.<br /><br />Tolkien was aware of these differences, and in 1960 wrote several different passages and revisions to bring \\"The Hobbit\\" stylistically more in line with \\"The Lord of the Rings\\".  These passages were published for the first time in 2007 with \\"The History of The Hobbit\\".  However, he showed the revised passages to someone (it is unknown who) who discouraged him from changing \\"The Hobbit\\".<br /><br />Ultimately, \\"The Hobbit\\" is a much different experience than \\"The Lord of the Rings\\", much more akin to classical fantasy fairy tale books such as \\"The Wind in the Willows\\" and \\"The Marvellous Land of the Snergs\\" in both style and tone than \\"The Lord of the Rings\\".  Too its credit, the success of \\"The Hobbit\\" was what prompted Tolkien to write the sequel.<br /><br />In the seventeen years between initial publication and the appearance of the first volume of its sequel (1937-1954), \\"The Hobbit\\" never went out of print (save only for a brief period during World War II due to paper shortages) and was a tremendous seller, without support from \\"The Lord of the Rings\\".  It is indeed a rich work, and is an undisputed classic.  This book is so much more than a \\"prelude\\" to bigger and better things.  It's a keystone work in children's fantasy, and stands among the titans of literature.<br /><br />-----<br /><br />Original Review 2000: \\"Inferiour to L.R.? I think not!  No, just different!\\"<br /><br />The biggest problem with this novel is perception.  Tolkien wrote this story for children; to be more specific, this was written for HIS children.  There were several stories like this, but it was this, The Hobbit, that  was his master achievement in children's literature.<br /><br />The Lord of the  Rings ( a single epic, NOT a trilogy) was written to cash in on The  Hobbit's success.  Tolkien wanted to get on with the more serious work of  his mythology, and ultimately that is what happened with The Lord of the  Rings.  It became attached to his mythology, and became as important to him  as The Silmarillion.<br /><br />So delineation is required if you want to read  this.  Do not go in with the thought that The Hobbit is a \\"precursor\\" or  any such nonsense to The Lord of the Rings.  Think of it like you would  think of any other children's classics: children's classics.  If you take  it on The L. R.'s terms, this is a failure, primary because it is not  written to be like that.  But, on the flipside, The L. R. is as much a  failure in children's fiction.  It is not children's fiction, it is epic  fantasy, and one should not equate it with children's fiction.  That is  EXACTLY what people try to do with The Hobbit.  They try to put it in the  same type of genre or playing field as The L. R.  They are both  masterpieces, and I love them both dearly.  But one is for children, the  other with adults.<br /><br />Of course, Tolkien is part of the problem.  How many  books do you know that is a children's book and has an adult sequel?  Not  very many.  The Hobbit, scarcely 300 pages, was written and published in  the children's market.  He then talked to his publishers, and they wanted a  sequel.  So he began \\"the new Hobbit\\", as C. S. (Jack) Lewis so aptly put  it.  He was preoccupied with his mythology, and the sequel was drawn into  it.  So we have two works, spanning two differentgenres, and as far as  surface connections go its little more than prequel/sequel.  Instead of  looking at The Hobbit as a prequel, a precursor to his ADULT masterpiece,  an inferiour version, think of as his CHILDREN'S masterpiece.  The Hobbit  is top of the class in children's fiction, one of the few contenders  against such other great children's works as Narnia and Wrinkle in Time.  The Lord of the Rings, likewise, is THE crowning masterpiece of the fantasy  genre, of which its influence is incalculable to that fantasy market.  Both  are as important as the other, just in different fields.<br /><br />I haven't  talked about The Silmarillion much.  I have already reviewed it, so I won't  go real in-depth here.  But the same thing happened with it.  People,  expecting another Lord of the Rings, were inevitably disappointed with the  Biblical style of the published version.  If Tolkien wrote that book out in  narrative form as he did Lord of the Rings, it would be ten times longer  than Lord of the Rings.  The biggest problem with Tolkien is people have to  many preconceptions that are incorrect.<br /><br />So, basically, in conclusion,  think of it like this:<br /><br />1.  The Hobbit - Children's masterpiece.  He  scores big with this one.<br /><br />2.  The Lord of the Rings - a single fantasy,  not a trilogy.  (Tolkien was always quick to point that out).  The Crowning  achievement of modern fantasy.<br /><br />3.  The Silmarillion - the Bible of  Middle-earth.  Much more for students of his work than the causal reader.<br /><br />[From the Amazon.co.uk review: Enjoy Tolkien's Middle-earth!  I certainly have!<br /><br />Mike London]	2000-04-07

In one of his biggest best sellers, childrens' Bruce Coville sets out to tell a story that will capture the imagination of a typical fourth to sixth grader, while writing a story of enough substance to delight adults as well.  The premise is certainly interesting enough: what would happen if one of your teachers was an alien?  Worst yet, what if said alien was planning to kidnap you and four of your classmates at the end of the school term?    Coville takes that premise and runs with it.  The main heroine, Susan Simmons, has just that situation on her hands.  This is the story of how Susan must find a way to overcome Mr Smith, who is not quite as human as he appears.  There are several memorable scenes, such as the first time Susan sees Mr. Smith unmasked, the unraveling mystery of what happened to Ms Schwartz, the teacher Mr. Smith replaced, the ongoing tension and fear the school begins to feel as the alien rumours spread, and the towering climax at the story's end.      Where Coville keeps the story so accessible is he takes everyday life at school that kids are intimately familiar with, and charges up it with a tightly structured, fast paced science fiction plot that keeps you reading.  All the typical school kids are here.  The school bully (Duncan Dougal).  The social, geeky outcast (Peter Thompson).  The goodytwoshoes kids (Stacey and Mike).  The average, well rounded student (Susan Simmons).    Enough cannot be said about Broxholm, the alien.  The character is well drawn, believable, and scary.  You really start rooting for Susan to overcome him.  In the first book, he is a menance that must be overcome.  All this changes in this book's three sequels.  It stands as a testemant to Coville's skills as a children's writer that by the end of the four novels you truly sympathise with Broxholm.    In the end, Coville has createda highly readable story that will keep kids clamoring for more.  I dare say if there are any adults along for the ride they will find this book a highly enjoyable light read as well.    The first novel in the series, in many ways, is also the most different.  After becoming an international bestseller, Coville wrote three more sequels to this story.  They are as exciting and fast pace as the original are, although much more serious and not nearly as light hearted.  The principal difference between the first \\"My Teacher\\" book and the proceeding three is this is very much a stand-alone book.  You can read this without reading the other three.  The other three are all heavily interdependent of one another to conclude the story.      The other principal difference between this and the sequels is the first book is a rollicking good science fiction story without any deep undercurrents or themes.  Starting with the first sequel, \\"My Teacher Fried My Brains,\\" Coville develops the story to a deeper philosophical statement on the state humanity is in.  The fourth and final novel, My Teacher Flunked the Planet, is much more serious in tone and subject matter, with a much broader scope, than the first novel.    While in many ways the three sequels are as satisfying to the reader as the first, they just don't compare with that lightening bolt success of the original.  However, what makes this series such an outstanding success in the world of children's literature is the deep psychological awareness that Coville demonstrates about the human condition, and the willingness he displays of tackling such heady subjects in the form of middle-school novels.  While the first one is certainly highly readable and self-contained, you would be amiss if you did not read the rest of the series.	2000-01-24

One of my child hood favorites!  It has been forever since I've read it, and seemed to have lost mine a long time ago.  My story is much like the lady who is just below me.  A story read  long ago and far away, and so much better than the drivel today!   Thankfully, like The Hobbit, I never forgot the title.  It made a real  impression on me.  One of the best parts is Gloria the little dog figurine  turning into ... well, just read and you will find out.  There was  something about kissing elbows, and the villan's name was Belinda.  I need  to desperately reread it to refresh my memory, however.  But this was one  of the stories that stuck out most to me when I was a kid.  Hardy Boys are  good, but a good faerie story is always excellent.  One of my chief desires  is to be a published fantasy author.  This is one of my inspirations.  I  fell in love with the characters, while at the same time desiring to create  characters of mine own.  This process is now in development, as I write my  own (adult . . . no sex, just aimed at adult) fantasy trilogy.    For the  High Schoolers, read Alfred G.

A very funny look at high school life thru the eyes of a cool girl.  The way it is set up is there are 10 or 12 sections or quotes taken from the High School Rule Book.  Then, they tell the story that corresponds with  rule section.  This format fits the story very well, and is very inventive  from a writer's standpoint.  It is a cool look at high school life.  The  girl wants to be a writer, and tries to get something published in the  school journal.  The only problem is its by a die hard cynic who doesn't  like her.  Its an endearing story.  In a way, it is like several  ministories tied into one, the character going thru her high school career.   The ending is well conceived, and has real meaning.  Be yourself.   Excellent book!  <br />Also recommended: No Flying in the House.  Classic  Faerie Tale story.	2000-01-13

This is not a work to be taken lightly, for here we at last uncover the great truths of Middle-earth, and hear of its creation.<br />The Silmarillion,  simply put, is a tragic book, beautiful, with one flaw that nearly kills  it.  It was unfinished.  We do not know (or ever will) how much different  it would have been if Tolkien live to complete his greatest work.   Christopher his son has done as well as can be expected, but there are  quite a few style shifts betraying his pen instead of his father's.  This  is to be read with such seriousness as The Illiad or The Odysse.  It is a  mythological work that should be studied.  This is not for a conventional  reader, this is for the serious student.  Without the knowledge his other  two novels (for Lord of the Rings is one novel, not a trilogy) The L. R.  and The Hobbit, The Silmarillion is not near as rewarding as it would  otherwise be.  The Hobbit is for children, The Lord of the Rings is for  adults, and The Silmarillion is for students of this great work.  All  students interested in literature should read this, flawed as it is because  of the mortality of man.  <br />It also shows how strong Tolkien believed in  God.  His world was very much a Christian world, set up in the likeness of  God.  God is never mentioned in the L. R., but as I remember he is in The  Silmarillion.  You see him with the Ainur create the world.  Truly, this is  a master of fantasy, and a great Christian man.	1999-11-29
