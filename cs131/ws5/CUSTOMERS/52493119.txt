And this short, subtle, shadow-haunted novel is one of her finest works.<br /><br />A quarter of a century before Goth culture came into vogue, this compelling urban fantasy took readers on a frightening journey into a very dark & malicious Faerie indeed, one that could be reached merely by going behind the walls of just the right (or wrong) basement, where lank-haired, emaciated elves feed on hallucinogenic fungus & prey upon one another as viciously as they prey upon any hapless humans who fall into their hands. Written & published during the first resurgence of fantasy in the late 1960s, before the genre became glutted with identical mass-market \\"sagas\\" & \\"epics\\" with no genuine magic to them, this tale has lingered with me like a fading but unforgettable nightmare for decades now.<br /><br />Fans of Neil Gaiman & Charles DeLint (among others) should do themselves a favor & track down a copy of this disturbing gem, which deserves reprinting today. You won't be disappointed, I assure you. Highly recommended!	2005-09-15

Even its genre of science-fantasy is nearly forgotten in this current age of bloated, overwritten Tolkien clones that have none of the Professor's mythic touch & intelligence.<br /><br />The story: in a post-nuclear world that's been reduced to a Medieval state, the King is dying of an unknown malady. One of his warriors, unjustly condemned to die, volunteers to cross the wastelands in search of the mysterious Dark Lady, who has allied herself with another state (clearly the remains of the Soviet Union, also reduced to a Medieval state). Various mutations serve in place of traditional fantasy monsters & otherworldly beings, and do so very well. The journey itself is harrowing & well-written.<br /><br />What lifts this story above its basic plot is the inclusion of the Dark Lady, apparently a primal force from the dawn of time, who has always existed & always allied herself with the strongest man. She is indeed La Belle Dame Sans Merci: not cruel, not malicious, but dangerously alluring & sad & utterly pitiless. This element made the story remain with me vividly, decades after first reading it.<br /><br />As I said, it was never more than a paperback original, destined to be discarded & forgotten soon after it was sold & read. But it's still worth seeking out & reading now, and deserves to be reprinted in an anthology volume of such novels (or more properly novellas). It does in 150 pages what all too many 1000-page epics of today fail to do: entertains & enchants. Recommended!	2005-09-13

Still an eerie & moving journey for the discerning reader, this is the edition to own. Coleridge's deceptively simple structure is the scaffolding for an increasingly intense & subtle poem; and Dore's illustrations are the perfect complement to Coleridge's words. I really can't add more to the previous reviews, except to say that here we have wondrous example of visonary literature, retaining its power to chill & transport after nearly two centuries.

Because she gave birth to children in the past, she isn't eligible for the immortality treatments available to childless Westerners. Nor is she eligible for medical treatment beyond that of pain relief, despite the discovery of a lump in her breast. So she begins to reflect on her life & its worth, while waiting for death. And in facing the past, she prepares for the final end so few of her contemporaries will ever know.<br /><br />Joyce Thompson has created a frighteningly plausible future here, not that different from our present. Immortality requires a more stable society, with more strictures & regulations, administered by an increasingly impersonal & heartless bureaucracy. Third World peoples work for the immortal West as indentured servants, practically slaves in all but name. And despite the potentially limitless life of this new society, it's increasingly empty & rigid, devoid of much real joy.<br /><br />But as Eve periodically retires to her beloved blue chair to look at her own life, she also begins a new one, realizing that her humanity is all the deeper & richer for being so ephemeral. At first in small ways, then in larger ones, she defies the mores of her society & strives to live a whole & meaningful life, however short it may be. A fine addition to the shelf of dystopian literature, with a strong humanistic bent, it's definitely a book in need of reprinting!	2005-04-20

All are uniquely gifted songwriters & performers whose work deserves to be better known. I knew very little about some of them, even though I was a young teenager during their prime; but after finishing this book, I sought out several of their CDs & was not disappointed. For example, I was already somewhat familiar with Tim Buckley's music, but Tim Hardin & Fred Neil were little more than legendary names to me, with just a couple of songs each known only through cover versions ... now their music is a vital part of my life. Brend does a fine job of giving the reader a basic biography & artistic overview of each man, as well as a feel for the times that shaped them, and which they helped to shape. Well worth reading! And be sure to investigate the music when you're done, via the samples available here at Amazon.com. You'll be buying a few new CDs yourself!	2005-04-13

The fact that these fascinating case studies are presented in the style of mysteries to be resolved is a plus, reminding us that our lives are essentially narratives. We live by the stories we're told & the stories we tell ourselves, the stories we attempt to live. Weinberg takes something of a back seat, letting the individuals & their lives speak for themselves; but the reader is always aware of his intelligence & compassion. With so much of the mental health field dominated by cost analysis & treated with drugs that don't always address the real problem, this volume reiterates a vital truth: therapy is as much an art as a science, and empathy is as important as insight & wisdom. Rewarding reading for anyone interested in the universe of the human psyche!	2005-04-05

As our young protagonist begins to experience timeslips, he (and we) get tantalizing glimpses of a rich fantasy world of American pre-history, one which has never been recorded. Slowly we begin to realize that this simple family, which many might dismiss as nothing more than hillbillies, is actually descended from forgotten Welsh mariners, perhaps with a touch of Faerie at one time ... and that even though they themselves have forgotten their purpose for remaining in their green backwater, something ancient & evil is buried beneath the land they own & guard. And that evil is waking ...<br /><br />In this & several other novels, Jane Louise Curry creates a unique mythic world, one which deserves to be much better known. I've always hoped she would one day write a longer novel set firmly & completely in the fascinating past of these novels, all of which deserve reprinting in a uniform edition, perhaps even a boxed set. Highly recommended!	2005-04-04

A fine, nuanced, thoughtful work, it explores the choices to be made by the individual conscience of each Catholic. Far from trying to make things easy, it advises wrestling with the issues & making deeply considered & deeply felt decisions, rather than letting established dogma do the thinking for us.<br /><br />For those who cling to a strict & narrow view of Catholicism, as if it has been unchanging since the founding the Church, I can only state that Catholicism has changed & grown constantly over 2000 years; indeed, it could not have survived this long without doing so. And just as the accepted truths & dogma of centuries past have been modified or discarded completely, in keeping with the changing times & the growth of human understanding, so too will many of the supposedly uncontestable truths & dogmas of today be modified or discarded eventually.<br /><br />These are dark & uncertain times; and in such times, frightened people tend to clutch at fundamentalism & rigidity, often surrendering their own consciences to an established, unquestioned belief. But the truly courageous spiritual seeker won't simply abdicate his or her life & conscience; instead, he or she will most likely take the more challenging path offered by Wilkes, and attempt to find the common ground between the institution & the individual.	2005-04-01

This is one of those books, written by someone who was there on the inside, participating & observing in delight & wonder ... & perhaps a litle bit of bemused trepidation, too. For younger generations, the 60s are often just a flashy mass of superficial cliches, co-opted by commercial culture & stripped of any deeper meaning. Derek Taylor reminds us that it was a period of yearning, of searching, of exploration ... and yes, sometimes youthful folly. But that was part of the journey, for as William Blake told us nearly two centuries before, \\"If the fool would persist in his folly, he would become wise.\\"<br /><br />What's especially enjoyable about this book is that it covers a lot of ground that gets overlooked by the usual 30-second clips & sound bites of this era. The London poetry scene, the synergy in the arts -- it's all here, with tidbits of unexpected information. For example, the Beatles mulling the possibility of starring in a film adaptation of \\"The Lord of the Rings,\\" with Paul as Frodo, Ringo as Sam, George as Gandalf, and John as Gollum? Could there have been better casting? :)<br /><br />Such was the colorful, absurdly wonderful reality of that brief moment in time, when it truly seemed possible to tear down the \\"dark, Satanic mills\\" & build a better world. It must seem utterly unreal & impossible to a younger generation, but yes, the everyday world wasn't always such a dark, cynical, despairing place ... and maybe it offers hope that we can outlive these current bleak times & eventually build something better one day.<br /><br />Definitely recommended!	2005-03-11

But I hasten to add that Donovan is a superb reader for these evocative stories: always articulate, precise, and just a touch ethereal.

But it is a perfect introduction to some of his most important concepts, with an initial essay by Jung himself & several more by key figures of Jungian thought & work. By directing their focus to very specific points, these essays illuminate Jung's ideas in a clear & accessible way, particularly for the lay reader, for whom this volume was intended.<br /><br />If there's any one theme, it's that of the Symbol: its power, its manifestations, its meaning to the individual. I especially like Aniela Jaffe's \\"Symbolism in the Visual Arts,\\" which looks at the appearances & continual re-appearances of powerful spiritual symbols through the history of art, illustrated by the work of many fine artists; and also Joseph Henderson's \\"Ancient Myths and Modern man,\\" which demonstrates how primal symbols, far from being part of humanity's past, are still quite present & working within the psyche of contemporary culture. But every essay is well worth reading & re-reading.<br /><br />Jung's goal with this volume was to provide a primer of sorts, a beginner's guide to the riches & mysteries of the human psyche. In this he succeeded -- I can't imagine anyone reading this book & not coming away with a deeper appreciation & better understanding of the inner universe. Highly recommended!	2005-02-18

Like so many science fiction novels from the late 60s/early 70s, this is a concise, straightforward story without any unnecessary padding; yet it's also rich in detail, characterization & depth. I think it's Cooper's single finest work, and urgently in need of reprinting. Any reader of adventurous science fiction could do far worse than discover this stirring tale. Recommended!	2005-02-18

Books	5	3	3	N	N	Through the gates of midlife	Don't mistake this for a story starring the fictional Justice League of America. Instead, it's a tale of young friends who loved the JLA, playing their roles as children, lost in wonder & fantasy ... and then grew up in this \\"real\\" world. The naive, optimistic memories of childhood heroes have been smudged & tarnished a bit as the friends go their separate ways, changing (sometimes for the better, sometimes for the worse), and negotiating the more complex & often more muddled world of adulthood. Until one of their number arranges a reunion, complete with the costumes of their childhood favorites ...<br /><br />What follows is a very funny, very moving tale of people who have both gained & lost something in the process of growing up, now reclaiming a little of that childhood magic, and perhaps carrying it with them as they move towards midlife & beyond. The writing is DeMatteis at his best: insightful, tender, hilarious. Better still, he's reunited with his \\"Brooklyn Dreams\\" compatriot Glenn Barr, who provides superb art. An overlooked & highly recommended gem!	2005-02-02

It doesn't have a plot so much as an underlying archetypal theme, that of Man pursuing the ideal & unattainable Feminine in all of Her ever-changing aspects; but it does have an ongoing narrative drive, one which unfolds in fluid prose, rich in imagery & emotional intensity. Ferlinghetti perfectly recreates the essence of a dream, which has its own logic & its own needs, and makes its own sort of deep sense. The reader has only to surrender to its flow & be carried along, with one image or scene yielding to another in a continuous surge of immediate experience & psychological surprise.

This is no simple self-help book, with vague, homogenized talking points & feel-good aphorisms. Hollis makes it clear that some of our most pressing & urgent questions may never be fully answered; but he also makes it clear that even an incomplete journey to wholeness is vital & worth the effort. Yes, his book demands slow, careful reflective reading ... but he's here to offer us some insights about the path ahead, not to hold our hands every step of the way. For of course the path is going to be different for each one of us. If we indeed want to create a life worth living, we have to meet our guides halfway -- something we sometimes forget in a shallow, fast-paced culture which seldom challenges us & spoon-feeds us comforting junk food instead of genuine nourishment.<br /><br />Highly recommended!	2005-01-06

It remains one of the best introductions to Jung's thought & basic concepts that I know. Singer's personal touch, both in her own case histories & her autobiographical anecdotes, add to the book; the feeling is one of listening to a wise woman, rather than hearing a dry lecture. Singer not only knows her material intellectually, she knows it in her soul, and that comes through on every page. This book made me start paying attention to my dreams, and gave me a much-needed framework for understanding my life at a crucial time, when I was most in need of such a framework.<br /><br />While the revised & updated edition is excellent, I'd also recommend reading the original 1972 edition if you can find it. For example, Singer's chapter on Jung & the Counterculture is superb, and not nearly as dated as the author herself believed; in any case, it provides a valuable on-the-spot account of Jungian thought & its intersection with the 1960s, the impact of which is still being felt today. Yet it's also fascinating to read the follow-up stories of some of her patients in the newer edition.<br /><br />Jung is a much better known name today than when this book first appeared, but his thought isn't always as well understood as it might be. Let Singer take you on a revelatory tour of the Psyche & learn far more about both Jung & yourself than you ever imagined. Highly recommended!	2005-01-05

While the fantasy masters (Morris, Dunsany, etc.) republished in the Ballantine Adult Fantasy Series continue to remain in print, the authors of this slim but rewarding volume have been sadly forgotten. Presenting a pairing of two allegorical novellas dealing with the Phoenix of myth, it succeeds both as entertainment & something deeper. Let me especially note Cooper's \\"The Firebird\\" -- if his use of the Journey of Life is straightforward, his detailed images, rich colors, & evocative landscapes bring that journey to vivid life. The novella is as much a tone poem, a flowing music, as it is narrative; it deserves to be much better known. And Green's \\"From the World's End\\" is subtle & literate work, with pyschological depth. Together, these two novellas will transport readers & leave them thoughtful afterwards. Those looking for typical action & adventure will be disappointed; those looking for insight & mythic resonance will find both in abundance. Highly recommended!	2004-12-30

This fine book, collecting & conveying the emotions & experiences of men who had the moral courage to question the Government, question an immoral war, and ultimately question the beliefs with which they were raised, is a vital reminder to all that \\"patriotism\\" is too often used as an excuse for blind, unthinking inhumanity.<br /><br />Now that America is engaged in yet another unnecessary war, fueled by ego, ideological ambition, and outright lies, it's more important than ever that we remember these true heroes, and that we learn from them. In times of fear, it's always easier to simply go along ... but the mature & truly moral course is to constantly question the status quo, and to serve the demands of conscience rather than conformity.

In it he transcended his love of pastiche (well worth reading for its own merits) & created a moving tale of a dying Empire, drawing upon both the sword & sorcery tradition exemplified by Robert Howard, and the high fantasy tradition exemplified by Tolkien. Although it's a short novel, like all of his work, it's filled with evocative images & ideas. Sargon is a more reflective barbarian hero than most, both bemused by & grappling with the notion of his own supposed godhood. And the landscapes have a haunted, dreamlike quality: we know that not only the once-glorious Empire is doomed, but the very planet itself will one day be nothing but rubble, which adds a dusky poignancy to the tale. If Carter recreates favorite moments from previous fantasy & adventure classics (both Robin Hood & the Battle of Helm's Deep obviously come to mind), he imbues them with a certain melancholy heroism & somber beauty. Of all his work, I find myself returning to this one most often, wishing it had been longer. Here we get a glimpse of the great fantasy epic he might have written, one with his own voice; and we can only regret that it never came to pass. Recommended!	2004-09-28

This is one of his finest books, one of the first attempts to write about heroic fantasy as a genre, providing an essential guide to the traditional & sometimes neglected masters of the craft. Highly opinionated, of course; but that's really part of its charm. And the final chapters, regarding the actual craft of writing fantasy, are still well worth reading.

In a compact & moving tale, the story of Dr. Zhivago is recast as an epic of a far-future imperial Earth at the decaying point. Infused with a solidly-conceived mysticism that makes this a truly new story, rather than just an easy retelling, revolution sweeps away the decadent & cruel aristocracy that has been strangling the masses for centuries. Sh'reev, a mystical healer as well as a compassionate member of that aristocracy, is caught up in the massive changes toppling the world he knew. That world is depicted in swift, sharp inventive strokes of color and detail, from the ornate buildings constructed of holograms & hypervented air to the Vens, psychic offshoots of humanity bred to live in the hellish environment of Venus, to whom a simple jet of cold water is like searing acid. It's a novel well worth finding & reading. Recommended!	2004-03-31

All the more so for being true, as the author revisits several of his former patients to learn whether or not he helped them. This in itself would be reason enough to read this volume; but the unique personalities &amp; problems of his patients also make for compelling reading. I especially like the fact that even after the conclusion of his journey, the author still has questions about what's truly &quot;normal&quot; in our society, which in turn should make the reader consider those questions as well. Particularly fascinating to me were the stories of Naomi/Isabella &amp; Seth, two young people who rose like phoenixes from their deeply troubled lives to reinvent themselves. Their stories alone ought to reassure the author that he indeed did good, and more than good, for the wounded souls who sought his help.

By exploring the roots of both Tolkien's work & the fantasy genre overall, Carter provides much-needed perspective ... to say nothing of having introduced an entire generation of fantasy readers & future fantasy writers to the masters of the field. I still recall the excitement of learning about Lord Dunsany & Wiliiam Morris for the first time, and my appetite for their work was whetted by the brief samples Carter so tantalizingly provided to his readers!<br />The entire Ballantine Adult Fantasy series so wonderfully developed & edited by Carter can be seen as an outgrowth of this seminal work; for that reason alone, it's deserving of praise. But it's also enjoyable & informative reading on its own merits. Carter wrote at the height of the intial Tolkien craze & much of that exhilaration & delight is reflected here. His prose is deceptively easy-going & always accessible: he's clearly writing about a living man & his living work, not the ponderous monument so many writers have since made of him. Yes, there are more detailed (and more accurate) books about Tolkien, but this one truly conveys the pleasures of masterful & classic fantasy. Recommended!	2003-10-30

Far from being \\"occasionally sappy\\" (as one review puts it), the prose & story deliberately recreate the idealistic state of mind that was very real in 1970, along with the ever-present undercurrent of dread that was Vietnam. Yes, people really were that \\"sappy\\" back then, nor did they feel ashamed of it or feel any need to justify or explain it. It's probably difficult for a lot of younger readers to understand how people could have been so willingly vulnerable & open, but such was the case ... and Scott Lax has captured that wonderfully. The prose is deceptively simple & lyrical, conveying a dizzying & contradictory weave of emotions. That's how it felt to be a young man in those days.<br /><br />But don't view this novel as merely a memory piece, or relegate it to \\"historical fiction.\\" In addition to capturing a specific time & place with a sure hand, the author has also given us a timeless coming-of-age story. I look forward to his next book. Highly recommended!	2003-09-22

Of course I was too young, too naive, too undeveloped to understand what it was all about back then ... but the vivid images & the urgency of the storytelling struck me even then. Now, some 30+ years & at least two dozen re-readings later, I can at last begin to fully appreciate the depth & immense power of Lindsay's work.<br /><br />\\"Allegory\\" to be sure, although that word hardly does the work justice, with its intimations of fustiness & neat symbols all in a row. Better to call it \\"Vision,\\" revealed in an awful & irresistable blaze that burns away the preconceptions & illusions of the Everyday. Maskull's journey is one that few are willing to undertake: the stakes are high & failure is the sugar-coated damnation of living in the world around us.<br /><br />Previous reviews have already provided enough story details & deserved praise for this important work. Let me just add my own highest recommendation to theirs: read these visionary pages & be changed forever. Most highly recommended!<br /><br />Devotees of this book might also want to hear Ron Thomas' fine CD \\"Scenes From A Voyage To Arcturus,\\" available here at Amazon.com, as well as searching out the rare DVD of a student film of the same book from 1970.	2003-09-09

DeMatteis' wonderful series about being a confused, angry, yearning teenager in the late 60s is finally available in one volume, and it's long overdue! Anyone who came of age in those years will recognize the emotions & situations, sometimes all too closely & accurately for comfort. And if it did nothing more than recall those times, as it does in such perfect & incisive detail, the story would be a thorough success.<br />But as the narrator reminds us, \\"This is a story about God.\\"<br />The voice of an adult Carl Vincent (or Vincent Carl) Santini -- don't worry, that's all explained -- provides the running commentary as we observe & enter into the troubled, searching life of our young protagonist, struggling to express himself, struggling to understand himself & the Universe, searching for Something long before he's consciously aware of it.<br />DeMatteis' prose is deceptively casual & easy-going, drawing the reader in as a confidante, but it's also insightful & honest. He cares passionately about the story he's sharing with us & that passion comes through. At the same time, his sense of humor prevents his story from ever becoming pretentious.<br />The powerful artwork of Glenn Barr brings this story to vivid life, changing to suit the tones of the story, ranging from cartoony to photo-realistic, often in the same panel. You'll pause & linger over many a page for the illustrations as much as for the words.<br />Quite a few writers are mentioned in the course of this story, all the usual suspects on the Road to Self-Discovery & Meaning -- Hesse, Huxley, Dostoyevsky, etc. Add DeMatteis to their company & get a copy of this superb book. I can't recommend it highly enough!	2003-06-05

One of the final volumes published in the legendary Ballantine Adult Fantasy series, this novel was also one of the very few originals in that roster of fantasy classics. It most definitely deserves to be in their company!<br />Nowadays there are all too many fantasy novels that are merely drab, by-the-number imitations of Tolkien. But in the first few years of Tolkien's mass popularity, his influence was far more subtle and original. What Laubenthal does in this wonderful novel is to capture the magical, otherworldly feel that infuses Tolkien's work -- as well as that of his fellow Inklings, C.S. Lewis &amp; Charles Williams. The result is a novel that burns with true poetry, true magic, true wonder.<br />The storyline seems improbable on the face of it: a quest for both Excalibur &amp; the Holy Grail in contemporary (1972) Mobile, Alabama? Yet it not only works, it works gloriously. I've seldom come across such a moving &amp; inspiring depiction of the power &amp; transcendent beauty of the Grail. And in the brief glimpses she gives us of the Otherworld, Laubenthal has created a seamless fusion of Arthurian mythos &amp; Tolkien-flavored fantasy. It leaves the reader wanting much more!<br />What Laubenthal has done, in fact, is not only craft a powerful &amp; entertaining fantasy novel, but successfully depict a spiritual journey in lyrical, luminous prose. Pagan &amp; Christian themes are perfectly interwoven into a shimmering tapestry. Both the characters &amp; the readers emerge changed by the end of this tale. Most highly recommended!	2003-05-12

At the time I was a little overwhelmed by its richness & depth, gleaning only a little of its wisdom. But after three decades of reading it many times over, I've grown enough to truly appreciate the soul-nourishing food for thought to be found in its pages. I've seldom come across an elucidation of Jungian & spiritual thought with such clarity & poetry! Even more than Jung's own work, this book gave me my first understanding of the reality of the Psyche, as well as providing me with a new perception of God & the Sacred which went far beyond the either/or simplicity of Literal vs. Illusion. It helped me to grasp that what goes on inside is just as real as the experience of the exterior universe -- in some ways, perhaps even moreso. And each new reading reveals more layers of understanding for me. Most highly recommended!	2002-11-07

His own work, alas, all too often emphasized his weaknesses at the expense of some very real strengths. But occasionally those strengths had their chance to shine, as in this solid novel.<br />While Leigh Brackett may have provided the basic model of his Mars, Lin Carter did something exciting & moving with it. Combining the wish-fulfilling adventure of the best of the pulps, a streak of elegaic poetry, and a clear, direct depiction of a dying culture struggling to resist the rapacious colonialism of a greedy Earth, he created a fine story that lingers after the last page. And while the science has been superseded by real-life discoveries, that hardly matters; the color & haunting, dreamlike longing for something precious but fading is what counts. A worthy addition to the small shelf of autumnal Martian fiction!	2002-08-01

Hollis is NOT offering simple answers or formulas; instead, he's making clear just how difficult but rewarding the Middle Passage (as he names it) can be. I especially appreciate his oft-repeated dictum that the goal of life isn't Happiness so much as it is Meaning. Isn't this perpetual struggle to find &amp; grasp an elusive happiness precisely what gets so many of us tied up in knots? His insistence that we must be willing to go into our own dark places, that we must be willing to acknowledge &amp; discard out illusions, is far better advice than most of the Self-Help industry offers ... and far more helpful. A book that provokes thought &amp; reflection, this slim volume of inner treasure is highly recommended!	2002-05-10

It could just as easily be a fundamentalist community of any religious stripe, or one of any ideologically-mandated group. Let's not forget that we have plenty of people right here in America who are convinced they know what's best for everyone, and who believe we should all be forced to live according to their beliefs; quite often they're the ones waving a flag and/or a cross most vehemently. In fact, there's one more book that readers of \\"The Giver\\" should consult: Sinclair Lewis' pre-WWII novel of Fascism coming to America, \\"It Can't Happen Here.\\" Because as \\"The Giver\\" warns us, it can happen anywhere.<br />Including Here.	2002-03-18

While laudably intended to promote understanding and healing, all too many have failed to address the painful moral questions of the War. Whether this is due to a reluctance to assign \\"blame,\\" or a fear of upsetting too many parents, is difficult to say.<br />Well, here is a fine book from the period in question that does not shy away from calling the War immoral, that does not hesitate to take authority to task, that does not fail to address the class and racial aspects of the War. Never strident, always gentle but firm in tone, it tells the story of a young white girl who is moved to organize a protest march when a young black man from her small town is killed in Vietnam. Written in sorrow for the deaths on both sides of the conflict, it's justifibly angry at the political delusions and empty patriotic slogans that kept the War going for so long. A short (barely 100 pages) but quietly powerful book that deserves reprinting.	2001-03-06

Madai, a young man born into a fishing family, discovers a moonstone amulet of the bird god Garuda, who introduces him to the spirit world and enable him to become a great healer. But he also finds himself tempted by the evil of the sorceress Rangda, who offers a path of power and riches. In the face of sudden losses and terrible grief, what choice will Madai ultimately make?<br />The story moves effortlessly between the everyday world of the island, with its occasional Western tourists, and the mystic world of spirits, demons and gods. Especially wonderful are the descriptions of Madai's voyages to the undersea realm of the Nagas, his flight to a moon of myth, and his journey to the mountain at the center of the universe in the company of Hanuman the Monkey-King:<br />  &quot;The army of forest creatures reached the shore of the island, and paused on a narrow beach ringed with fluttering coco-palms. The frothy ocean looked like purple jade in the moonlight. Madai wondered where they would go, for monkeys have no power to fly to other realms.  Then the white monkey made a running leap and vaulted into a giant somersault. It was all Madai could do to cling to the coarse hair of his neck as they whizzed through the air. They hurtled across the water--a vast distance, and landed in a desolate range of gleaming iron mountains, where the air was thin and nothing grew in the rusty dust.  ...Another leaping somersault, and they landed on the slopes of glowing copper mountains as the monkey grew even bigger.  Another leap across endless black waters, and they stood among silver mountains that shone with their own light, for there was no longer any moon or stars in the airless black overhead... Another hurtling somersault, and they landed among bright golden mountains that glimmered like morning sunlight.  The great monkey bellowed a great whoop and made another great leap, and landed on the slopes of a mountain so high that its peak could never be seen. The jagged boulders on the hillsides were made of precious stones--turguoise and jade, amethyst, ruby and lapis lazuli--that flashed in the crystalline light of a very young sun.

Addressing the reader in personable Victorian fashion, his prose is clear and beautiful. Consider this sample:<br />  &quot;Within the verge of the wood there were columbines, looking more pale than red, because they were so modest, and had thought proper to seclude themselves too anxiously from the sun. There were wild geraniums, too, and a thousand white blossoms of the strawberry. The trailing arbutus was not yet quite out of bloom; but it hid its precious flowers under the last year's withered forest-leaves, as carefully as a mother-bird hides its little young ones.&quot;<br />But Hawthorne is also equal to the task of less genteel, more vigorous images:<br />  &quot;At this sound the three heads reared themselves erect, and belched out great flashes of flame. Before Bellerophon had time to consider what to do next, the monster flung itself out of the cavern and sprung straight toward him, with its immense claws extended, and its snaky tail twisting itself venomously behind.&quot;<br />Adding to the pleasure of these retold tales is the gorgeous art of Arthur Rackham, both in black-and-white drawings and full-color plates, which captures the unearthly beauty and the unexpectedly surprising humor of Hawthorne's work.

This book is a valuable reminder of the truth about the anti-war movement:  that it was largely made up of ordinary people appalled and deeply saddened by this country's actions in Vietnam. Did you know there were organized groups such as Businessmen for Peace? Housewives for Peace? Did you know that a majority of military bases in the USA published underground anti-war newspapers? You'll learn all that and more in this thoroughly researched history of a movement too many people would like to forget. Read and learn! In a society that would rather feel good about itself than examine its national conscience, it's good to know that some refuse to settle for complacency. Needless to say, this important book is currently out of print, like many of its kind - may they be reprinted soon!	2000-10-02

Having recently acquired a copy once more, I find that it has lost none of its quiet power. While countless books deal with the Vietnam War, the antiwar movement, and the cultural upheaval of the 60's, most are written on a wider scale. This small, contemplative book provides a more intimate look, telling how two sensitive, middle-of-the-road, \\"nice\\" teenagers were torn by the war dividing their country, and how they were ultimately moved to a tragic act of despairing protest. While the war that claimed them is over, the issues they confronted still remain: How does a feeling human being deal with and live in an often harsh and uncaring world? Do we attempt to grapple with pain and meaning, or do we shut out everything that disturbs us and go about Business As Usual?

US	52493119	R1HO7WUH484BJ8	0140042598	303305496	On the Road (Penguin Orange Collection)	Books	5	4	5	N	N	A paean to the people and possibilities of America	Has there been any other writer in this century who loved America, the green and golden rolling landscape, the exuberance, the optimism, the sheer *idea* of America, more than Jack Kerouac? In an endlessly unrolling stream of wild, excited, energetic prose, we're carried across this country with wide eyes, taking in a rush of images and people, all our senses immersed in the journey, becoming part of the American epic ... an America where every individual has the potential to be larger than life, to participate in the joy of being alive. It's all the more powerful for not stinting on the darkness and disappointments we'll encounter along the way; life is all the more precious for them. Not for everyone, obviously, but a book to be experienced by those who seek something more than the Everyday. Does it provide all the answers? No, of course not - it simply reminds us that it's worth going out and looking for those answers, and that the search is as important as whatever truth we eventually find. Highly recommended!	2000-09-21

Enjoyable simply as a story for readers of any age, it offers  quiet and rich rewards to those who wish to read more deeply. If possible,  look for the earlier edition with the original Pauline Baynes  illustrations. A reminder that true fantasy ultimately deals with the  Mysteries ...	2000-09-01
US	52493119	R63JZA8B2GVYG	0441374719	575453312	Isle of the Dead	Books	5	15	16	N	N	A concise, compelling epic	One of Roger Zelazny's finest novels, this tale of a man who embodies an  alien god encompasses science-fiction, mythology, psychology, and the  poignancy of being human - and does so in well under 200 pages. There's no  overload of unconvincing background minutiae here - with no more than a few  colorful strokes, Zelazny creates a rich and meaningful universe for his  flawed protagonist Francis Sandow. What begins as a confrontation between  two powerful men swiftly becomes a private apocalypse between two gods ...  without ever losing its human scale. Dazzling, exciting, moving, satiric,  this book deserves to be reprinted soon!	2000-08-30

While  sensitive children will certainly enjoy it, I think adult readers will  discover far more - rich in symbolism, which never overwhelms the  narrative, and conveying an atmosphere of unearthly peace, \\"The Golden Key\\"  acquires a patina of subtle beauty and meaning with each new reading.  Highly recommended!	2000-08-30
US	52493119	R2GOB6ROPIO843	0441654312	685854664	Pavane	Books	5	3	4	N	N	A lean, lyrical masterpiece	Written in prose as strong and precise as wrought ironwork, yet rich and  vivid as a sudden spray of summer blossoms, \\"Pavane\\" takes the reader to an  alternate England of rich and vivid detail ... you can feel the bite of  frost and snow, the sting of salty waves on your face ... A beautifully  realized world has been created, with a history and cast of characters that  *feels* real. Science fiction or fantasy? Perhaps a little of both -  although forcing this book into any particular niche is beside the point.  What matters is its humanity and its stark power, which will remain with  you longer after you finish the last page. Please reprint it soon!	2000-08-29
US	52493119	R2QWDT28N3NL1K	0877971803	460042634	The Other Side of the Mountain	Books	5	10	11	N	N	A compelling spiritual nightmare	I first read this book as a teenager over 30 years ago, and it has remained with me ever since, always disturbing, always demanding to be examined more deeply. When I found a paperback copy at a used book sale two years ago, I found that my memories had not played me false - if anything, it was even more troubling now that I was old enough to better comprehend it. Is the author describing life as Hell or Purgatory? I waver between the two, even as the book's grotesque images appear in my mind, appalling but powerful. Well worth reading ... but be prepared to be haunted afterward.	2000-08-24
US	52493119	R1FS3OPMG2NVPX	1853262366	652475340	Man Who Was Thursday (Wordsworth Collection)	Books	5	14	17	N	Y	Witty, bewildering, challenging, rewarding	Those who read \\"The Man Who Was Thursday\\" as an attack on free thought are  taking it at a terribly literal level. Aptly subtitled \\"A Nightmare,\\" it  has the qualities of a dream: the sudden nonsensical leaps that make  perfect sense, the joyful sense of play and paradox, and the anticipation  of some Final Meaning that never quite arrives, yet still somehow  satisfies. The transition from satirical detective story to spiritual  allegory is suffused with a growing elation, hinting at truths we already  knew, if we could only remember them. At its heart is the belief that every  life, no matter how prosaic on the surface, despite its suffering -  especially through its suffering - participates in the ongoing glory of  Creation; and while Chesterton was writing from a distinctly Christian  perspective, his story transcends any one orthodoxy. He was clearly drawing  on the depths of the psyche in writing this book; one gets the feeling he  was a little puzzled at its ultimate sources himself. Other reviewers have  drawn different meanings from it - I have myself after various readings -  but this is one of its chief delights. Read and decide for yourself!	2000-08-24

I can only  echo the praise of the previous reviewers on this page, all of whom were  obviously touched by this neglected classic as deeply as I was. While  there's a glut of fantasy novels available these days, all too many are  lacking in true Magic - a poetry both crisp and lyrical, an understated but  rich symbolism, a sense of the Mysteries, that is the essence of  \\"Lud-in-the-Mist.\\" Add to that its subtle and delightful characterization,  its often cheerfully earthy humor (\\"By My Great-Aunt's Rump!\\"), and the  sheer beauty of its prose, and you have a book that belongs on any short  list of fantasy masterpieces. A book to be read many times, one that takes  the reader ever deeper with each reading. May it never be out of print  again!	2000-08-22

It's a book meant to be  experienced as one experiences an especially vivid dream, dazzling and  delighting the dreamer. And like all fine poems and dreams, it always hints  at more, just beyond the reader's eye, mysteries like flowing veils of  faintly shimmering twilight, concealing even more mysteries ... arcane  symbols galore, for those who want to decipher them, and a wealth of  sensuous details on every page. Read it, savor it, and be reminded once  more of the infinite riches of the imagination.	2000-08-21

But \\"A Walk Out of the World\\"  is not just another competent-but-familiar Young Adult fantasy. Written  when the author was eighteen, this lovely novel has a haunting, lyrical  quality to it that lingers long after, a knowing innocence and a gentle  strain of melancholy that touches the soul. Most fantasies are symphonic in  scope - this one is a string quartet, with an aching cello sobbing softly,  sweetly at its heart. Long overdue for reprinting!	2000-08-21

Her response? \\"You know, I was expecting some stereotype of  `cool' Beatniks, trying to be so hip and detached. But that's just some  popular media image. The people in this book are exuberant, thoughtful,  even spiritual!\\" That sums it up as well as anything. Forget the glib idea  of alterna-cultural one-upmanship that passes for a Beat attitude these  days - \\"The Dharma Bums\\" is about naïve exuberance, anything-but-ironic  soul-searching, an eager exploration of life's sorrows and joys, and the  sheer, exhilarating, wondrous zest of being alive and aware in an endlessly  fresh world. If reading this clear mountain stream of a book doesn't make  you want to change your life and your way of looking at life, then you're  just hopelessly blind to something precious! Life is so much more than the  neatly packaged, pre-imagined commercial that society would love to sell  you, and \\"The Dharma Bums\\" will gladly show you one possible way of finding  your true path.	2000-08-15
US	52493119	R2CLBTB663FUXV	0670245410	370028190	Craig and Joan: Two Lives for Peace	Books	4	6	6	N	N	A poignant reminder of war's lesser-known losses	I first read this sad, touching account of two teenagers taking their  lives in the name of peace almost thirty years ago, when I was a teenager  myself, and I have never forgotten it. Having recently acquired a copy once  more, I find that it has lost none of its quiet power. While countless  books deal with the Vietnam War, the antiwar movement, and the cultural  upheaval of the 60's, most are written on a wider scale. This small,  contemplative book provides a more intimate look, telling how two  sensitive, middle-of-the-road, \\"nice\\" teenagers were torn by the war  dividing their country, and how they were ultimately moved to a tragic act  of despairing protest. While the war that claimed them is over, the issues  they confronted still remain: How does a feeling human being deal with and  live in an often harsh and uncaring world? Do we attempt to grapple with  pain and meaning, or do we shut out everything that disturbs us and go  about Business As Usual? This is a book still worth reading, and deserves  to be reprinted.	2000-08-15
