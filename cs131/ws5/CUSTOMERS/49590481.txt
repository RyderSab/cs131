As a consultant who has been training both Chinese and Ex-pat staff in the area of cross-culture for many years I found the material up to date, fresh and well written. West and Chee do not prescribe to the notion that China's economy is a house of cards ready to fall--or to the equally spurious claim that China is about to take over the worlds economy with its mythical 1.3 billion consumers. Instead, the authors paint a realistic and pragmatic picture of what the 'real' situation is in China and how western business people can best position themselves to meet the challenges of entering its growing market.<br /><br />This book is written with a genuine affection for China and its culture and it's obvious that the authors have a wealth of insight and experience in dealing with both business and cross-cultural matters on the mainland. I particularly liked the format of the book, which took 10 popular myths about China and the Chinese and debunked them using solid evidence and prescient insight. However, this book is not just about demolishing stereotypes and myths. It's about gaining a realistic view of China, its people and its economy and then getting the reader to understand how they can adjust their work and communication style to leverage their ability to work and live more effectively in China<br /><br />At a lean 148 pages (British edition), Myths about Doing Business in China has no fluff or filler and can easily be digested in a few hours. The only downside to this book is the $42 price tag that the Philistines at Palgrave, Macmillian extort from the buyer! Yet with that said, I also have to admit that in the long run you'll still consider it money well spent.	2005-05-31

In fact, what Ms. Kelly is particularly good at is taking people (or families) who have an unquenchable thirst for power, money and the limelight and showing us all the damage they do while clawing their way to the top. Anyone who feels that the Bushes have been treated unfairly should keep in mind that they have built their reputation and fortune on connections built through so called 'public service'. Ms. Kelly has therefore done us a big favor by exposing the hypocrisy in their carefully cultivated 'public' image.<br /><br />Nothing is this book is terribly surprising though. Most of the stories and anecdotes just go to confirm what any conscious and thinking individual has already known for years; that the Bush family are a clan of spiteful and ambitious mediocrities. Again, unless your head has been in the sand for the past 25 years, this shouldn't be a real shocker.<br /><br />The real surprise here is how well written, entertaining and thorough this book is. For those who have accused Kitty Kelly of fabrication and exaggeration, keep in mind that she has just taken on one of the richest and most influential families in American history. Do you really think that with the legion of lawyers at The Bushes disposal that Ms. Kelly could get away with libel? Of course, every time Kitty writes a book she is labeled a liar and fabricator, yet for some uncanny reason her story seems to consistently hold up over time. Not really the 'MO' of a serial slanderer don't you think?<br /><br />Well, unlike most of the shrill Bush apologist that have written most of these reviews, I actually read the book and thought it was good fun. Just keep in mind the old adage that 'truth is stranger than fiction' and you won't have a hard time digesting this well written and meticulously researched book.<br /><br />P.S. For the reviewer who labeled Kitty Kelly as 'un-American' and said she should be sent to Leavenworth... seriously, get some good medication and relax is front of some good ole' reruns of He-Haw.un-American' and said she should be sent to Leavenworth... seriously, get some good medication and relax is front of some good ole' reruns of He-Haw. <br /> <br />	2004-09-15

The central theme of this book is that through fear, paranoia and xenophobia we can rid the world of those pesky little terrorists that are such a thorn in the side of America.<br />... I don't think I've ever read such dangerous and misguided screed (and I've read 'Mein Kampf and 'The Protocols of the Elders of Zion').<br />I hope that the readers of this book will see it for what it really is- a vulgar curiosity, a violent and hateful diatribe, a prescription void of any historical and geopolitical knowledge and a peon to a lack of critical thinking.<br />I generally try to be a little more specific and objective when I write a review but this book is so muddled and illogical that I can't even begin to enumerate everything that's wrong with it (plus, some other reviewers have done a pretty good job of that already).<br />For those of you who have given this book a five star rating let me give you a couple of recommendations:<br />1. Read the allegory of the cave by Plato. In case you finish it and don't see any relevance, here's a clue; you're the one's who never left the cave.<br />2. Turn off the Fox network and try to get a wider perspective for your news<br />3. Reread the Constitution of the United States.<br />4. Sell your 4x4 and use the money to travel abroad so you can see first hand how the rest of the world perceives you.<br />5. Try adjusting yourself to the idea that maybe, just maybe, the United States of America is not the center of the Universe.<br />That is by no means a comprehensive list--but it's a start.	2004-01-30

As a notorious bastion of rouges, thieves, soldiers of fortune, drug smugglers, prostitutes, pleasure seekers, speculators and industrial tycoons- it is second to none. From being a sleepy little fishing and trading village on the Huangpu river in the early 1800's to becoming one of the worlds largest ports and a city of over 14 million people- Shanghai has had more than it's fair share of growing pains. Not very many cities on the globe can match it in having gone through so much political and financial turmoil in the last 150 years.<br />When I first picked up this book I was a little skeptical. The title, `Rise and Fall of a Decadent City' seemed a bit over the top and I was afraid it was going to end up being three hundred pages of vice soaked sensationalism. As a resident of Shanghai I have discovered that the myth of old Shanghai often looms larger than the truth.<br />I was pleasantly surprised. The book was meticulously researched, well written and most important- interesting. Since this book is a history of Shanghai, China's most populous and prosperous city, you also inadvertently get a short course in modern Chinese history while your reading it. From the Taiping rebellion to the opium war and the Boxer rebellion- many of the great historical events in Chinese history are clearly laid out and explained in the context of how they influenced and helped to form Shanghai.<br />`Shanghai, The Rise and Fall of a Decadent City' is a very good piece of popular history and I highly recommend it.	2000-10-18

This book begins with the author flying over my home town of Provo, Utah and wondering how in the hell are there can be so many people in a land that is primarily desert. It's a question (as a native of Arizona and Utah) that I have often asked myself.<br />This book is for anyone who has ever turned on the hose to water their lawn and wondered &quot;where did this come from?&quot; Not only does this book answer that very important question, but also it does so in an interesting, humorous and provocative way. The story of securing water in the west is a story of intrigue, corruption, political infighting, greed and pork barrel politics. The chapter on how LA got their water (fictionalized in the film 'Chinatown') is worth the price of the book alone.<br />Though the author states in the revised and updated version of this book that his original thesis may have been a tad alarmist, I think this book is as prescient and important as it was when it was first published in 1986.<br />Well researched and written with incredible flair, this book is a must for anyone interested in western studies, water politics, the environment, social studies, or just anyone who has ever drank a glass of water (I guess that includes everybody). This is one of the best non-fiction books I have ever read because it changed my way of thinking- I have never been able to look a body of water in a passive disinterested way since. I imagine that's about the best compliment you can give a book- that it changes the way you see your world.	2000-10-06

The Cultural Revolution (1966 to 1976) has gone down in Chinese history as one of the darkest times the nation has ever lived through in its modern era. A mob mentality had taken over a fair portion of the population and Red Guards persecuted the 'politically incorrect' with a quasi-religious zeal. Anyone having western sympathies, or that were considered 'capitalist roaders' (one who advocates capitalism) were subjected to seizure of property, public humiliation, and in the case of Nien Cheng and many others- torture and imprisonment.<br />When so many people were acting in such a sheepish and reprehensible manner it's refreshing to read this story of a woman who stuck to her beliefs and carried herself with dignity and honor- despite the consequences (I might add that there were many like her).<br />This is a beautiful story of a woman who lost so much, including her only child, but tells the story without guile and resentment. Well written, honest and touching- I recommend 'Life and Death in Shanghai' whole-heartedly.<br />Historical Note- As a resident of Shanghai I have spoken to many people who had lived those difficult times and have found nothing that contradicts anything that is contained in this book. I would also like to note that despite the dark picture painted here, I can assure you that Shanghai is really a wonderful place to live in these days!	2000-10-01

Bryson has done a masterful job of wading through a lot of linguistic scholarship and synthesizing it into a very informative and funny book for the English enthusiast.<br />Many of the reviewers below seem to have gone out of their way to point out every little error contained in this book, and there certainly are a few. However, if you put all the factual mistakes in perspective by looking at them in relation to the wealth of information contained in this book (often up to a dozen facts and anecdotes on each page), you'll see that the errors make up an incredibly small percentage and don't in any way detract form the overall impact or enjoyment of this book (it would, however, in the future be nice to see a revised editions with some of the most egregious errors removed).<br />Unlike certain self-righteous, dead languages (that I won't mention by name...but Pierre knows what I'm talking about!) that insist on goose-stepping around in their arcane linguistic jackboots- English is alive and kicking. This book celebrates the mother tongue as the bizarre mish-mash of styles and influences that it is. You can't read it without appreciating it as a breathing language that is constantly in flux, always reflecting the cultural diversity of its many native and non-native speakers.<br />I've recommended this book to oddles and oddles of folks, some of whom were not particularly interested in language, and they all ended up loving it.	2000-09-29

'The China Reader'offers a good selections of reading on Chinese culture, politics, education, media, economy and foreign relations in the post Mao era. Though some of the articles should prove useful in the long run, many of them will be hopelessly dated in a very short time (the fate of any book dealing with contemporary Chinese issues).<br />Nevertheless, I found the book to be very interesting and useful in augmenting my understanding of current affairs in China. I particularly liked the articles in the chapter entitled `Society' that dealt with crime, the environment, and poverty and population issues.<br />Schell and Shambaugh are `old China hands' and know their material well- so this book won't be disappointing for serious China watchers.

Of all the biographies and stories that have come out of China in the last few years, `Wild Swans' is by far my favorite. I can't think of another book that captures the tumultuous changes that China has gone through in the last century with as much feeling and sensitivity.<br />From the end of the Ching dynasty to the Sun Yat Sen years, through the revolution, the great leap forward and the cultural revolution- Jung Chang paints a picture of three generation of Chinese women dealing with a country in constant flux. You don't have to be particularly interested in China or Chinese history to enjoy `Wild Swans'. It's a fascinating, down to earth and well-written story that would appeal to just about anyone.<br />I highly recommend it.	2000-09-28

The next time some smug nabob starts muttering under his/her breath about the drain on our economy caused by the proverbial `welfare mother' (you know, the one that's driving the Cadillac), you can put em' in their place armed with the wealth of info contained in this short but well written little book.<br />As `Take the Rich Off Welfare' aptly points out, welfare really does suck a lot of money from our treasury, but it's not the poor and needy in this country that benefits from this bonanza. As a matter of fact the word `wealthfare' is more applicable, because that's who's really benefiting- the wealthy.<br />Very brief, but meticulously researched and with sources to back up every fact, `Take the Rich off Welfare' is a great introduction to the big wide world of graft in America.  If you've ever been curious about who has their foot in the back door of the treasury- check out this fine book.	2000-09-27

The atrocities committed by the Japanese in Nanjing during WWII are some of the most gruesome and heinous in the annals of world history. Despite the incredible level of cruelty and the hundreds of thousands of deaths that were incurred, the events are rarely discussed in any detail in most history text books in the States- and have had practically no exposure in the Japanese educational curriculum (as opposed to the Germans, who by law must teach about the holocaust).<br />In `The Rape of Nanking' Iris Chang has done a fine job of bringing the `other holocaust' to light. Well written and fully documented, Chang tells us the story of the rape of Nanjing from three different perspectives; the victims, the Japanese soldiers who committed the crimes, and the handful of western ex-patriots who tried desperately to help the oppressed by providing medical help and protection (ironically, one of the most valiant in this respect was John Rabe, the head of the Nazi Party in Nanjing).<br />This book goes a long way in explaining the chilly relations between China and Japan that still persist (as a resident of Shanghai, I can safely say that the Japanese are still thoroughly loathed here for what happened during the war). Chang also explains how the US was complicious in underplaying the whole affair for the sake of normalizing relations with Japan after the war (and even covering for members of the royal family who were involved in the whole affair but exempt from prosecution).<br />I thought Chang did a great job in explaining how the Imperial government of Japan had spent years dehumanizing its soldiers and creating an environment where these kinds of atrocities were bound to occur.<br />The book may be a bit biased (I haven't read much history that wasn't) but I think that Chang has done an important service in opening up this subject to wider public discussion and scrutiny.<br />Though the book may be a bit grisly for the faint hearted- it is nevertheless an important read for anyone interested in modern history or sociology.d for anyone interested in modern history or sociology.	2000-09-27

This is undoubtedly one of the most impressive political biographies I've ever read. I have to confess from the outset (with a tad of embarrassment) that I pretty much had no idea who Henry A. Wallace was when I picked up this book. What shocked me most after reading 'American Dreamer' was how a man that was so revered and despised in his time has been so conveniently left out of any present discourse on that era.<br />In 'American Dreamer', Hyde and Culver give a well-written and balanced account of the life on one of the most enigmatic and progressive political leaders that America has ever produced. Why his name has never come up in years of taking history courses amazes me- especially in light of the fact that his thoughts on the cold war, which he tried desperately to steer us away from, turned out to be quite prescient.<br />Henry Agard Wallace was Secretary of Agriculture for eight years, Vice President for four and Commerce Secretary for a short time before his forced ouster. Wallace ran for the Presidency in 1948 on the Progressive ticket, lost, and then left public office. What Wallace left us during this time was a legacy of innovative leadership, genuine public service and a virtual revolution in agriculture.<br />Wallace eschewed the world of dog eat dog politics and preferred appealing directly to the public than orchestrating back room machinations. He was honest, direct, practical and always put the public good above his own wants or ambitions. In short, he had everything that seems to be lacking in the American political spectrum today.<br />As I read the book I couldn't help but think what would have happened if Wallace had remained Vice President (instead of Truman) and therefore become President at Roosevelt's death. It seems to me that the worse excesses of the cold war and the red scare could have been avoided and that US policy in just about every area may have been put on a more evenly keeled tack for the future (it would have been undone later, but hell, it's a start).<br />Wallace was often accused of being an impractical dreamer- but if what he accomplished in his years of public service were the deeds of an impractical dreamer- then we can certainly use more of them.er, but hell, it's a start).<br />Wallace was often accused of being an impractical dreamer- but if what he accomplished in his years of public service were the deeds of an impractical dreamer- then we can certainly use more of them.	2000-09-23

I bought what I thought was a  biography on the great socialist leader Eugene Debs only to find that it  was a long winded, pretentious and disjointed meditation on the socialist  movement and the utopian communities that led up to it.<br />I don't know what  Marguerite Young was thinking when she decided to tackle this project but  it certainly wasn't a biography in the traditional sense. I guess I should  have paid more attention to the words 'Harp Song' in the title because  that's what this book really was- a bloody long harp song.<br />I suppose that  if you're a fan of Young's prose you might appreciate this book but for  anyone looking to get some insight into the life of Eugene Victor Debs-  you'll have to go elsewhere.	2000-09-09

How is it that democrats, republicans, socialist, and every other wing nut- on the left or right- can claim Jefferson as their own?<br />In this well written an insightfull book, Joseph Ellis does some serious mining into  Jefferson's character. What he digs up is a man riddled with  contradictions- that lived and governed in a land of contradictions. The  fact that Jefferson has been able to repeatedly extricate himself from  serious damage to his reputation is an indicator to just how big a 'sacred  cow' he has become. The truth is, he did more good than bad- and no matter  what anyone digs up on him he will still be America's touchstone of  liberty.<br />I think that Ellis comes to terms with Jefferson in this book.  The author, like most people who have studied his life, can't seem to help  but accept Jefferson for what he was- a visionary of flawed character who  was very much stuck in the economic and political realities of his  time.<br />I think this book does a fine job of painting Jefferson in all his  colors. I recommend however, that if you haven't read other biographies of  Jefferson, do so before reading this one. Although it can stand on it's  own, I thought that having read several other books on him first was  helpful.	2000-06-25

I'm finishing Voltaire's Bastards for the third time and I can honestly say that I have enjoyed the book more, and have gotten more out of it with each reading.<br />This book is an attack on the rational system of thinking  that has produced a world of technocrats and second rate managers, kept the  United States in a wartime economy for 50 years and enveloped our  government in a cult of secrecy. Saul's attacks- whether they be against  the political system, modern culture or our convoluted economy- are dead  on. As Jim Hoagland stated in his Washington Post review, &quot;Voltaire's  Bastards is a hand grenade disguised as a book.&quot;<br />Though Saul's  writing style can be a tad stilted and occasionaly repetitious, this book  is very well written- despite comments to the contrary in other reviews.  Whatever flaws one chooses to find in Saul's writing style, they certainly  don't detract from the overall importance of this major work.<br />I recommend  that anyone who is even remotely concered with the course modern  civilization is taking should read this book.	2000-06-24

Alot of folks who have reviewed this book need a hug and a valium (a potent combination I might add).<br />Let me start by saying that the title of this book is a bit misleading, and intentionaly so. This book isn't about  arguing as much as it's about communicating. Mr. Spence useds the word  'argument' in the context that everything we articulate- whether it's a  desire to teach , punish, express wants or state an oppinion- is essentialy  an argument.<br />The twist to this little tome is that effective arguing is  not a act of selfishness but a labor of love. A good argument is one in  which the greatest good is served.<br />I particularly found the chapter on  arguing with kids quite useful. I tend to be quite authoritarian and rule  oriented when it comes to child rearing and this little chapter taught me  that kids will grow into responsible loving adults without being constantly  hovered over and corraled into so called 'correct behavior'.

Thomas Paine is one of the great unsung heroes of early American history. He didn't come from an affluent family, he never held high public office, and he never had any money. There are no monuments in Washington D.C. or  Philadelphia dedicated to Mr. Paine, he's not on any currency and he's  affectively been eclipsed by many other revolutionary heroes- that are  quite frankly his inferiors. Thomas Paine has been shortchanged in history  because he was a drunk, an atheist and an all around unpleasant person  (well...if he didn't like you, anyway).<br />Despite his shortcomings, and  the numerous attacks that have come from his critics, Tom Paine was the  conscience of the American revolution. He wrote several pamphlets and  articles that called the American populous to action and galvanized  revolutionary thought, not only during America's fight for independence,  but also for the French who were about to engage in their own  revolution.<br />Jack Fruchman has done a fine job of giving us Mr. Paine with  all his imperfections and accomplishments. I recommend that every serious  student of American history read this biography of one of our great  patriots, thinkers and writers. I just admonish you not to forget to read  the words of Thomas Paine himself. His thinking is as important and  relevent today as it was 225 years ago.	2000-06-01

One of the best indictments of colonialism that I have ever read, King Leopold's Ghost is obsensively a book about power and greed.<br />Leopold, a King of a small country and a man with very limited powers, decides that he  desperately needs to find a colony where he can reign supreme. He finally  discovers Central Africa, a place that hasn't been gobbled up by the other  colonizing powers, and claims it for his own. What ensues is one of the  most brutal subjegations in recorded history. King Leopold's reign in the  Congo was so vicious that even the other colonial powers of the day had to  condemn him.This book is the story of a man that was so greedy- even the  pretext of humanitarian aims were summarily ignored during his rule.<br />One  of the things I liked most about this book is that it deflates the hero  status of people like Henry Morton Stanley- an insecure man who shot  Africans for sport. In his place, Hochschild has given us people like  E.D.Morel, William Sheppard, Roger Casement and Hezekiah Shanu to look up  to. People who tried to make a difference when it wasn't popular to do so.<br />This book is the very sad story of how the ego of one puny despot lead  to the deaths of millions.<br />Informative, honest and well written- I highly  recommend this book.	2000-05-28

Wow, what a dictionary! As far as dictionaries goes, this is the dictionariest. This is the paragon of dictionaries, it's super dictionariarific. I paid almost 300 clams for this dictionary and I don't  regret it. I paid 300 dollars for a root canal once and when I was done I  said, &quot;is that all I get for three hundred bucks&quot;.<br />I have never  said that about this dictionary.<br />If I want to know what Boswell or  Chaucer meant when they were using a certain word, all I had to do is look  in this dictionary!<br />The only problem with this book is that the words  are super small. The publishers, however, have been most charitable in  adding a swell magnifing glass so you can actually read it.<br />I love my OED  and if there were such a thing as the 'Dictionary Police' who went around  confiscating peoples dictionaries...they would have to pry this one from my  cold dead fingers.<br />This dictionary makes me want to write a special haiku  in its honor.<br />Oodles and oodles<br />words poppin' up everywhere<br />hoodwink  is a verb	2000-05-27

I read this book two years ago and thought it was a great read. I just finished reading it again and have to say that I liked it even more the second time around. I should warn you however, that if you're looking for  lighthearted summer reading that'll lull you into complacency and make you  feel all warm and fuzzy about the world- stick to Oprah's book list. The  only warm fuzzies you'll find in this very informative and well-written  book are the microbes and viruses that make up the subject matter.<br />Laurie Garrett has done a masterful job of chronicling the spread of  infectious diseases over the last 50 years. The book is divided into  sections that give the history of the rise (and in one or two cases- the  fall) of the major pandemics of this century. The chapter on AIDS is worth  the price of the book alone and should be required reading for political  science students. It's the perfect case study on how apathy, intolerance,  ignorance and political infighting foster the spread of infectious  diseases.<br />The underlying message of The Coming Plague is that we are at  war with oodles and oodles of really small things whose survival instincts  are much better than ours. In short- we're losing! These pernicious little  buggers seem to be able to adapt much quicker than we can find new ways to  kill them.<br />The Coming Plague reads like a detective story. And Garrett  does a fine job of making it human and personal by giving us a peek into  the lives of the scientists who are heading up the fight to solve the  mysteries -and the victims who suffer from them.	2000-05-19

I just finished reading this book for the second time and liked it even more than I did the first time.<br />This is a truly amazing story of power, corruption  and how intrigues, infighting and byzantine court politics affected the  lives of hundreds of millions of people during the 'Great Leap Forward' and  'The Cultural Revolution'.<br />Anyone interested in understanding how one man  gained so much influence and power and held such sway with his cult of  personality should read this fine book. It was particularly tragic to read  how the Chinese people became the pawns in Mao's personal political  struggles. Scarier yet is how his wife, Jiang Qing (a obviously neurotic  and paranoid woman), would gain so much power for herself.<br />This is a must  read for any student of twentieth century politics or modern Chinese  history.	2000-05-14

This book was interesting, well argued and passionate. However, it was ultimately handicaped by what seemed to me to be a ludicrous premise!<br />I'm not a professional scientist but I just find it hard to imagine how  anyone could possibly think that all the big questions are close to being  answered. As an amateur historian, however, I have seen this idea expressed  many time before... and I don't see why this latest assertion won't end up  on the same pile as the others.	2000-05-13

This book is a good primer for anyone interested in an introduction to the  history, personalities and methods in cryptography. I'm not very adept at  math but that didn't hamper me in reading this book. Simon Singh, as he did  with his book on Fermat, takes us 'innumerates' into mind when writing his  books and gives clear and concise explanations that don't get lost in  jargon or presume his readers are math heads.<br />A fun and informative book  on an important and facinating subject!	2000-05-13

One Hundred Years of Solitude is one of my two favorite pieces of fiction ever written (the other is Lolita in case you were wondering). Rarely do you find an author that has such an amazing handle on language. Marquez  seems to write effortlessly and his prose is never pretentious or forced.  The best thing about the book, however, is that it's never boring. I have  to admit that it's the only fiction book that I've read three times (and  I'll probably read it again in a few years).<br />Over the the last eighteen  years I have recommended this book to dozens of people and those that have  taken the time to read it have always told me they loved it.	2000-05-06

John Forbes Nash's cotributions to math are undeniable. He was an  extraordinarily original thinker with undeniable genius. I thought Sylvia  Nasar did a first rate job in documenting his life- yet I walked away from  the book feeling a little bit empty. I think the reason is that JFN Jr.,  extraodinary as he was, was pretty much a useless human being outside the  world of math. He was extremely selfish and a pariah to his colleagues and  fellow students. I found it hard to sympathise with his mental illness when  he treated everyone with such disdain- before and after he was diagnosed  with schizophrenia. In the end I closed the book and said &quot;why should  I care about this person.&quot; Call me old fashioned, but being a great  mathmatician or scientist is more that just creating theorems or  inventions- It's a matter of character..something JFN Jr. was completely  lacking in.	2000-05-06
