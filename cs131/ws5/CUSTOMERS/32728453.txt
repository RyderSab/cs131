Based on this one book, author S.D. Perry seems to be one of the best of the writers who works primarily at spinning out new tales generated from other (i.e. non-novel) forms of storytelling like movies, comics, and games, and this is solid, well-executed action horror with potential to pleae a huge audience, and possibly even turn some non-gamers onto the Resident Evil video games. <br /> <br />  The biggest flaw is the book's shortness: it clocks in at 242 pages of fairly large-type pages in paperback form, and almost every aspect of the novel could have benefitted from having more space to develop.  In the length we have, Perry does a great job of establishing location, atmosphere, tone, etc. so that in almost every scene it's very easy to visualize and place yourself there.  The character roster is a mix of characters from the early games and brand-new characters making their first appearances here, and again the writer excels at giving a strong feel for the character's basic personality, mannerisms and appearance in just a few short introductory sentences.  I would have loved to have seen how far she could have gone if she'd really delved into each character deeply; unfortunately it seems that the vast majority of novels derived from movies, etc. (they're technically called 'media tie-ins' but I find that term sounds almost.....dismissive of both the novels it refers to and the other forms of storytelling from which they germinated), with the exception of the \\"Star Wars\\" books, concentrate on going for short lengths.  In some that's the runtime the plot calls for; in others, like here, all kinds of scenarios and plot points could have used a lot more pages.  Not just extra words, a longer timeframe for events too, in my opinion.The ending, especially, is too abrupt. <br /> <br />   Still, it's high-powered stuff while it lasts.  The characterization is great, some genuinely funny 'dry wit' dialogue (without coming off as dumb or inappropriate to the scene) helps both with making the characters feel very real and likable, and with just making the passages hugely enjoyable to read, and various issues and backstories for the characters leave you wanting to read more on them; they're Definately not just blank slates inserted to fire weapons and fall before the monsters.  Speaking of the monsters, their individual handling is well-done too.  Very, very fine book recommended for all horror fans (with crossover appeal for fans of commando-type espionage/adventure stories) and of course for anybody into the RE games, movies or comics.  I definately want to read more of Perry's Resident Evil books.  8.5 out of ten; could have been even higher if there'd been more room to grow.	2005-10-04

It's clear from the onset that John is less than thrilled with this move, and thus the novel launches itself from the familiar but time-tested angle of the unhappy homecoming. <br /> <br />   Considerable animosity persists between Frank and John from events years before, and almost immediately upon arrival, subtly strange events occur.  The book is very driven by the inter-relationship angles between the four family members.  Julia is instantly a likable character, while her husband almost as quickly establishes himself as a petty and petulant character, quick to take great offence at any real or perceived slights to himself and equally quick to shrug off or laugh off any of the same slights or difficulties experienced by others, including his own family.  The grandfather, Frank, quickly cements himself as a likable enough though highly cantakerous (understandable, considering his recent misfortune) character although before long one may find oneself wondering if that initial impression of likability might have been misplaced.  Bri is the best character of the core family, a bright, inquisitive and likable girl who I think many readers - whether male or female - will find themselves relating to in the way one would to a younger sister or niece, the way I did.  This one character is responsible for a good deal of the book's relentless readibilty even in places where the going gets slow or runs a bit Too close to familiar storylines. <br /> <br />The ghostly elements are well-done - really not suffering from their familiarity - but what really gets creepy is the subtle tension coming from Bri and Julia living in this house with Frank and John and the mysteries of what secrets one or both of them arehiding.  There quickly seems to be a strong connection to a girl named Abby whom John used to know; not to mention that an inordinate number of people on the island seem to be experiencing delusions about everything from ghostly organ music in the night to giant-sized rats lurking around the wharves. In terms of writing, it's in the middle of Hautala's work: not the best example of his writing style but better than a couple of works which have to some degree misfired in the prose department.  At one point Hautala was considered to be on the cusp of joining King, Koontz, Barker et al. in the sales department but he's since dropped through the cracks to a much lower profile; hopefully his popularity will move back up higher in the near future.	2005-10-04

The real story is that of its title character, a capuchin monkey who's been genetically engineered to the point of human or above-human intelligence, and who serves as a 'witness', using implants to record the activities and lives of their human masters.  Like all witnesses, Lovelock has had an innate affection for and loyalty to his 'master' programmed into him, hence the disturbing accuracy of his name.  Even so, the monkey is astute enough to recognize what humanity is stepping towards here - 'slavery without shame' - by developing animals to human levels of intellect (or perhaps to the human Variety of intellect would be more appropriate; human society in the novel seems quite oblivious to the prospect that some animals might already have their own fairly high intelligences of a different perspective that's more suited to their individual life patterns) and engineering them to, in effect, like it.  The terrifying thing is I can see this potentially happening, and possibly well before humanity is ready to attempt interstellar travel. <br /> <br />   The unforseen catch is that Lovelock eventually grows to want his freedom.  What though, could a single small monkey do about his situation?  Given the vast mental capacities programmed into him (even among the enhanced witnesses Lovelock seems to be quite the intellectual prodigy) and the fact that it never seems to occur to any human that a mere animal could do anything But docilely serve them, the answer might be surprising. <br /> <br />   The ending of this book is mind-blowing.  Science Fiction has delivered some great endings of awe and discovery and revelation, but few that pack this kind of emotionally hammering punch.  Few novels of any sort have delivered this kind of finale, where you can scarcely believe the words you're reading on the page.  In terms of the science/ethics condundrums potentially faced in humanity's future (well actually I guess you might as well say the present in this day of advanced biotechnology, A.I., etc.) this is along the thoughtlines of works like \\"Frankenstein\\", \\"Jurassic Park\\", \\"Monkey Boy\\" or the prequel portions of \\"The Animatrix\\".  A great - and emotionally turmultuous - gem of science fiction that could open a lot of eyes to the power of the SF field at its best; and to a host of real-life questions that are becoming more relevant day by day, as a possible future version of the human race is viewed through the eyes of one of their new slaves.	2005-09-26

Featuring a different artistic style (especially in the first story, \\"Gon Eats And Sleeps\\") than the later Gon volumes but no less phenomenal.  In the back of the book are photorealistic drawings of the real-life species depicted in the three tales - so photorealistic, in fact, that at first I thought they were actual black-and-white photographs.  That's how great the art is.<br /><br />  \\"Gon Eats And Sleeps\\" is possibly the most essential tale in understanding this enigmatic little dinosaur.  Readers who start with a subsequent volume may well ask themselves 'why does he keep tormenting that poor bear so?'  In this tale we see the beginning of the rivalry between these two titans, a rivalry it seems the Bear is always destined to come up with the short end of the stick on.  Basically, Gon takes great umbrage when a large grizzly bear chases a smaller one off a catch of fish the smaller bear has caught.  And thus the lifelong animosity begins, an animosity that notably doesn't extend to other bears, just this one, 'The Bear'.<br /><br />  It isn't always spelled out as clearly in subsequent volumes, but when Gon goes on the offensive against The bear or some other creature, it seems obvious there is some past transgression (usually directed against one of Gon's small, defenceless animal friends, it seems)that has sparked the blood feud.  Ferocious but valiant, Gon marches through life enjoying the world and defending the weak with his own sense of justice, and while I don't feel the little guy is sadistic or mean he sure can be an intimdating force.  As I noted in doing a writeup on \\"Gon Color Spectacular\\" Gon never kills his foes and they seldom are worse off than a few bruises and scratches; too much serious carnage would definately ruin the charm and tone of the series.<br /><br />  The second tale, \\"Gon Learns To Fly\\" is one of the most hilarious tales in the Gon pantheon and simply has to be seen to be believed.  Words cannot do this an adequate description, but talk about refusing to admit defeat!  And in \\"Gon Glares\\" - which certainly boasts some of the most, er, unique visual imagery ever captured on paper through either pen or photo, we see that even in defending his circle of friends Gon is not without compassion for his predatory adversaries.  A perfect ending to a perfect book; a perfect start to a whole series of unforgettable Gon adventures!one of the series. <br /> <br />  The second tale, \\"Gon Learns To Fly\\" is one of the most hilarious tales in the Gon pantheon and simply has to be seen to be believed.

US	32728453	R3N27HV7PQO4XC	0785109641	279941995	New X-Men, Vol. 1	Books	4	9	9	N	N	Tremendous Tales That Could Have Used More Time To Tell	Reprinting #s 114-126 of \\"New X-Men\\" (formerly the adjectiveless \\"X-Men\\" that returned to its prior title after # 156) and the \\"New X-Men Annual 2001\\", this hardcover contains the first year of writer Grant Morrison and artist Frank Quitely's run on the book, which continued straight on until # 154.  This run of the title was....different.  It aimed to reinvent the book while keeping the heart and soul of the concept and the heart and soul of the characters.  The run featured fantastic storytelling, it for the most part was highly successful at keeping to the heart and soul of the original and lasting X-Men concepts, and for the characters, it was kind of a 'by-the-individual' basis, in that it succeeded with some, with some they were changed for the better, and on some I thought it kind of missed the boat.  I'll try to focus my writeup on just the 13 issues presented here, although it's kind of hard to view things in isolation because these books set in motion some lasting, possibly permanent changes in the Marvel Universe. <br /> <br />   It gets off to a tremendous start with the first 3 issues presented, the arc that introduced Cassandra Nova - who with this arc and her next couple of appearances established herself as one of the X-Men's alltime A-list villains, a level it usually takes a character much more than a year or two to attain.  This arc also introduces the concept of a built-in 'timebomb' within the genetic makeup of homo sapiens, giving the species a limited shelf life before extinction, as it is. This adds a whole new twist to the 'homo sapiens/homo superior war' angle, which has been perhaps the defining story factor in the X-Men since the beginning: that the X-Men are basically fighting a series of neverending battles (to borrow a phrase from another of comicdom's great heroes) to stop an allout war from erupting between the two factions of humanity.  With this new revelation, it's as if evolution itself has entered the battles as a more hostileforce than before.  Speaking of the 'two species', the 'third species' of humanity is also dealt with in here, non-powered humans who are grafting mutant organs onto themselves to attain superpowers.  As you can see, there's no shortage of innovative ideas here. <br /> <br />  No shortage of new characters, or of new paths for characters here.  Now the first problem: what's covered here in 13 issues should have - in my opinion, and I may be in the minority on this - been covered in maybe 16 or 17 issues.  There are places where things feel 'scrunched together' and a bit hurried - NOT in the first 3 issues, which are paced at perfection.  But during other times, a larger page count Really would have come in handy.  Not to draw out the main thrusts of the plots, where the rapid-fire nature creates a good and invigorating tension, but some of the story sidelines, some of the new characters.  In new characters some of those who we basically just glimpse here are given more time to shine in later issues of this and other series, but I personally would have liked to see them a bit more involved in the stories presented here.  Also, the 'side plots' - there should have been WAY more detailing the reaction to Xavier's announcement, and throughout the Morrison/Quitely run a number of characters were killed off, which isn't unrealistic, but were done so so quickly, without any buildup or aftermath - or even much of a death itself - to give those characters the sendoff I felt they deserved.  I hope this isn't coming off as unduly harsh; basically I'm saying that there was so much great and pivotal stuff happening that it just demanded more space to be highlighted in.   <br /> <br />  The art is a bit mixed.  Frank Quitely is one of the best in comics at drawing unusual creatures and lifeforms - whether monstrous, whimsical, or otherwise (the Beast's new look is Awesome!  Drawn perfectly in every panel) - but the depictions of the more 'ordinary' looking humans (mutants included) left something to be desired, particularly in the faces.  To Quitely's credit, the designs he did on the new uniforms was exceptional.  I was against the idea of ditching, even temporarily, the individual costumes in favor of a more uniform, 'paramilitary' type look, but they turned out so good that it was a bearable change. <br /> <br />Dialogue - excellent.  Characterization - as I said, a mixed bag in my opinion.  The differences in Emma Frost make her come off better than she ever previously had; the changes in some of the other characters's personalities and behaviors maybe not quite as much so.  I would have really liked to have seen the new characters Morrison and Quitely came up with given more play, not just here but in their whole run.  I feel Morrison's always been best with characters he had a hand in creating himself (a brilliant new character like Zauriel during his \\"JLA\\" run actually came off Better than classic JLAers like Superman and, especially Martian Manhunter (poor J'Onn went down so easily so often!) or with characters whose recent history was somewhat a blank slate for him to fill in (like \\"Animal Man\\" - the comic and the character).  This collection had the potential to be one of the alltime great X-sagas (like the \\"Dark Phoenix\\" saga, the \\"Further Adventures Of Cyclops & Phoenix\\" limited series from '96, - or like \\"Here Comes Tomorrow\\", Morrison's last arc on \\"New X-Men\\" and a highpoint in both X-history and Morrison's writing career. <br /> <br />So there's a few shortcomings here and there (or perhaps more tellingly, a lack of a few highlights that begged to be there) but overall this is high-quality, high-octane, intelligent stuff that no X-fan should be without, regardless of where one stands on whether the more controversial changes were for the better or the worse in the long run (now There's a subject that would take a lot of wordage to get into!)  Recommended highly.	2005-09-15
US	32728453	R2FSWGMEJWG9D4	1932664017	656727097	Courtney Crumrin, Vol. 3: Courtney Crumrin In The Twilight Kingdom (Courtney Crumrin (Graphic Novels)) (v. 3)	Books	5	1	1	N	N	Outstanding New Fable With Pretty Much The Full Crumrin Cast	Reprinting the third four-issue miniseries starring adorable young curmudgeon Courtney Crumrin and her excellent cast of co-stars, \\"In The Twilight Kingdom\\" manages to come very, very close to its predecessor \\"Courtney Crumrin And The Coven Of Mystics\\", which I consider to be one of the greatest comic arcs ever published.       The first issue reprinted here is a bit atypical for the Crumrin series; it's a brief visit back to the hometown Courtney lived in before moving to Hillsborough.  Different isn't bad though; this story is riveting as Courtney reconnects with her old friend and is disgruntled, and later more deeply concerned, about the turns her friend's life has taken in the past year.      It's with #s 2-4 that the story of young witches and warlocks eager to prove their prowess at the start of a new school year, the calamitous results of one spell, and the journey into the Twilight World begins.  Courtney finds herself compelled to help a group of her peers she's not especially fond of (our dear little grumpy champion does make human friends so easily!).  The journey to the Twilight Kingdom takes the group deep, deep into the heart of the world of the Night Things, farther than Courtney's ever been.  And when the Twilight King himself appears....    Now, this collection introduces a number of characters who could well go on to be longstanding parts of the Courtney Crumrin/Hillsborough/Night Things mythos, but it's the King who stands out.  Within the first couple of pages of his entrance he establishes himself as, believe it or not, not only one of the most fascinating and unforgettable characters in the aforementioned mythos but in comicdom as a whole.  When was the last time Any comic book character did that so quickly?  Maybe Imperiex's first true appearance in DC's \\"Our Worlds At War\\" crossover, but he'd been built up, both directly and indirectly, for a long time beforehand.  The Twilght King, like Uncle Aloysius, like the numerous unforgettable anddistinctive goblins (some of whom I don't think have even had their names revealed yet), like the Dreadful Duchess and like Courtney herself, is one of the reasons I think this ongoing cycle has what it takes to last, to be part of comic history like Superman or the X-Men.  Cripes, if not for the small fact that 99.9% of the world has no idea a series of books called \\"Courtney Crumrin\\" exist, this could be as big as Harry Potter or Lord Of The Rings.       There's a lot of similarities here to Potter actually, which brings me to another point.  The Crumrin series seems to get classed as a children's series, and while there's a lot in the books that appeals to me in the same way as movies like \\"Fairy Tale: A True Story\\", \\"Kiki's Delivery Service\\" or \\"Dumbo\\", there are other aspects that appeal in the same way as horror movies.  There is some dark stuff in here, harkening back to the fairy tales of old (you know, wolves wolfing down Grandma, wicked crones trying to trick little children into the oven...) and after reading quite a lot that's classedas horror and seeing - I don't know how many horror movies, hundreds At Least - I can confidently say that a character like Rawhead'N'Bloody Bones is Pretty Freaking Scary!  The stories are also full of compassion and wonder and fantasy, and I'm certainly not one to recommend blocking books, but the bottom line is if your five year-old wants to get into the world of Courtney Crumrin, perhaps you should read the first couple of isues to him or her as a bedtime story or someting?  Just in case the little ones get frightened...    All that aside (after all, Potter and other kid-geared stuff can be frightening for the Really young fan) this is a fantastic entry in the Crumrin series.  There's plenty here to appeal to fans of everything from anime to Harry Potter to epic fantasy (a la Tolkein and Robert Jordan) to Disney to the whole gamut of comic books out there and even to horror movies, with all aspects of the story blendedperfectly.  An outstanding volume of material, and Enter The Twilight King!	2005-09-15

Famines, natural disasters, serial killers, racism, envirornmental collapse, animal poaching, terrorism, domestic abuse, and homelessness have all been among the topics such icons as Superman, Batman, The Silver Surfer, Wonder Woman and Spider-Man have tackled, in ways that the ordinary person simply Can't, no matter how much it breaks one's heart to see the ills of the world. <br /> <br />  In \\"Batman: Death Of Innocents\\", the Dark Knight takes on the tragic horror of landmines and finds himself in the unusual position of being relatively helpless against the scale of the problem himself.  That scale is highlighted in the forward by Senator ('real-life', not DC Universe) Patrick Leahy and the afterword articles by (again, from 'our' world) Col. David H. Hackworth [US Army], Jody Williams [Vietnam Veterans Of America Foundation, International Campaign To Ban Landmines] and Jerry White [Co-Director, Landmine Survivors Network], which give background information on the tens of millions of landmines deployed around the world, often active for decades after their war is over, and killing or maiming many, many more non-combatants (Very often children) than whatever enemy the side that laid them in the first place intended them for use against (unless, of course, their intended target Was the civilian populace, which has been the case with both terrorist organizations and government dictatorships), and the tens of thousands total (soldiers, civilians, aid workers, anyone or anything you can think of) killed every year.   I should point out that the comic itself does not take a stand as 'for' or 'against' the justifications or morality of any given war, using instead the fictitious country of Kravia as the main ground for the story; it instead focuses on the horrendously indiscriminate killing of landmines against anything that moves, and that, as Col. Hackworth notes, \\"can't tell a tank from a tricycle\\". <br /> <br />  In the story itself, Batman is drawn into the conflagration of the Kravian civil war when a Wayne Enterprises employee in Kravia working on an irrigation project is killed when his car drives over a mine in the middle of the road; his daughter Sarah and her friend, a local girl named Mariska are in the car with him at the time but are apparantly not killed, going mising instead.  In Kravia we see the ruthlessness of both sides in this one particular civil war, and the deep goodness and quiet courage of those caught in the middle, including some people who risk everything to give aid to a child wanted dead by one camp of combatants as a \\"message\\".  The Batman himself is in great form here, both in character and physicality, altough there are a couple of scenes in which the potency of the character's ability are Arguably scaled back a bit to advance the plot and the points it makes; there's a mistake or two he normally would not have made.  Usually I wouldn't be in favor of scaling a character back because it suits the plot direction, but in this case I make an exception. Extremely well done, the only techical flaws in this outstanding book are a couple of instances where the diallogue gets a bit 'bumpy'; made up for tenfold in other places where the wordage is perfectly crafted and eternally memorable. <br /> <br />As a message book delivering extremely important points \\"Death Of Innocents\\" gets a perfect score.  Message aside, as a Batman tale, it scores around a 9.5, possibly a decimal or two higher.  Essential reading both for comic readers and those who aren't into comics at all; tremendously powerful and thought-provoking.	2005-09-01

The FBI's X-Files mainstays, Mulder and Scully, are caught up in a series of savage murders that somehow have a connection both to an illegal tissue-and-organ harvesting operation and a legendary Thai monster called the Skin Eater.  Vivid descriptions of place and situation, plus use of very engaging and memorable supporting characters created specifically for this book are highpoints in what should be a highpoint in the whole X-Files mythos.    Where we run into trouble, or where I do anyway, is with the main players: Mulder, Scully and Assistant Director Skinner all come off very differently than I interpret them from their screen appearances.  It's totally subjective of course, depending on how each person has previously perceived the characters, but this runs counter to my take on them.  Mulder and Skinner seem almost like they hate each other's guts and are on the verge of coming to blows at times - totally different from my own interpretation, where Skinner is often frustrated by Mulder's bending of the FBI protocols and Mulder's often frustrated by Skinner's overadherence to those same rules (even though Skinner's their closest ally among the FBI's higher-ups), but underneath those frustrations I always sensed a lot of mutual respect and even a (subtly presented) growing friendship as the run of the show progressed.  Dana Scully was, of course, the skeptic of the team, especially in its early years, and not the most emotionally extroverted person one's going to encounter, but in this book her presentation is beyond that - she seems cold and mostly devoid of compassion, which again is totally different from my take on the character.    It's a testament to the book's strengths and the author's skills that it came off so powerfully well in spite of this large flaw(then again, to another reader it may not be a flaw at all; it may be closer to their own take on the characters).  So good I can't even consider writing it off in spite of the character discrepancies, and has me wanting to read more of Mezrich's work.  Would have easily been a full 5 stars if the lead characters hadn't been so different from how I think of them; good enough despite that to actually manage to stay at four.  Story - 5/5  Writing- 4.5/5  Lead Characters From The Show - 2.8/5 (I have to admit they're very well written and well realized even if I don't agree with the take on them, and their dialogue is perfect, just not the inner thought processes revealed)  Other Characters, Good, Bad Or 'Neutral' - 4.5/5	2005-08-28

Lovecraft, Isaac Asimov, Dean Koontz and Clark Ashton Smith, all of them inhabiting the rich area of works that could be classed as both Horror and Science Fiction, with some of them leaning more heavily towards one side of the spectrum or another.  Not a weak story in the bunch, with several major highlights, including \\"Born Of Man And Woman\\" by Richard Matheson, \\"Orange Is For Anguish, Blue Is For Insanity\\" by David Morrell and one of the best Really short short stories ever published (all of 2 pages!), Asimov's chilling \\"Hell-Fire\\". <br /> <br />Another massive standout is \\"In The Vaults Of Yoh-Vombis\\" by Clark Ashton Smith, a writer from the \\"Weird Tales\\" era (20s-30s), who epitomizes the ability to blend Horror, Fantasy and early Science Fiction, and who deserves to be remembered with as much acclaim as Lovecraft and Robert Howard, but sadly isn't.  This story takes place on an inhabited Mars, where a joint team of human astronauts and Martians (members of a civilization that was apparantly once much more flourishing than it is when the story takes place) exploring mysterious ancient ruins on the red planet. <br /> <br />Dan Simmons's \\"Metastasis\\" uncovers the shocking truth of what Really causes cancer; in one scene that's particularly effective for setting up to make the revelations believable, the man who's come up with the central theory argues against a psychiatrist's more rational explanations with an observation about what is supposed to cause cancer, saying something to the effect of 'have you seen the Medical Associaton's list of what causes cancer?  It's Everything we eat, breathe, drink, touch or do to have fun.  That's just the same as saying they don't know.'  This and other arguements the story's protagonist presents make it eerily believable that there are more malign forces at work, at least in the context of the story. <br /> <br />Like stated above,not a bad story in here, one of the alltime best anthologies and an essential compilation for anyone into either Horror or Science Fiction (or both, of course).  Other writers in the book are Frank Belknap Long, John Shirley, John W. Campbell (with \\"Who Goes There?\\", the basis for the movie \\"The Thing From Outer Space\\" and its remake \\"The Thing\\"), F. Paul Wilson, Ray Bradbury, Robert Heinlein, Phillip K. Dick, Robert Bloch and Arthur C. Clarke, all of whom contribute works I think you'll be glad to have in your collection.	2005-08-28

It involves ghastly crimes committed both in the years-ago past and the current timeframe of the novel, some of them possibly coming from a supernatural angle; it involves the consequences of long-ago actions reaching into the present through both 'normal' means as memory and guilt and old secrets coming to light, and more exotic means, as it comes to seem that possibly the victims and/or perpetrators of old horrors are reaching forth from beyond the grave.  It involves a 15 year-old boy's quest to discover what drove his mother to suicide as well as the quest of the same boy and his best friend to learn the secrets of a dark, abandoned house seemingly possessed of its own mesmeric powers; much of these quests told of in the separate search of one boy's uncle - taking place later chronologically but interwoven in the flow of the narrative - to investigate the disappearance of his nephew.  It's one of the greatest books out there in chronicling relationships - parent-child, romantic-angle relationships, extended family, society interconnections in general, and explores the pure, the diseased, and the in-between territory of frayed but functioning relationships. <br /> <br />It highly astonishes in two territories in particular - that such brightness, humor(particularly in the turning of certain phrases), hope and purity can flourish so often in one of the darkest, most disturbing tales ever written (involving child abductions; a gallingly evil serial killer/serial rapist (as well as some other assorted nasty beings), themes of suicide; the buried uglinesses in society of deep racism and other condescending bigotries) and can do so utterly seamlessly, playing off each other to make the former even more moving and the latter even more frightful.  The other most astonishing point is something it does with one of the villains: you can go with the 'pure evil' villain or the 'sympathetic monster' angle, or the 'evil-but-you-see-where-it-comes-from' archetype; here \\"Lost Boy Lost Girl\\" takes a horrendously evil character and arouses not empathy but a peculiar sense of puzzlement over why this character is the way he is.  There was an interview done many years ago with John Ostrander, writer of Volume Three of the comic book series \\"The Spectre\\" (excellent; I think there may be a Trade Paperback reprinting part of the series's run here on Amazon) where he's explaining about a character who's been sent back from the dead not only to oppose evil on Earth but to understand Why it exists in the first place.  And I think that that, along with many other things, may be part of what the cycle begun here (this is just the first book, it's followed by \\"In The Night Room\\" and I believe more are coming) is trying to do - to explore the question of why evil is here in the first place.  It's one of the greatest theological debates of all time, and if the key to defeating an enemy is knowledge of the enemy than an understanding of evil is perhaps the most important quest the world can embark on, so Straub has taken on an ambitious agenda here.  He's proved here and in \\"Night Room\\" that he's more than up to it though.  This angle of the book doesn't fall back on the tired 'it's all society's fault' catchall arguement, nor does it seek an absolution for the atrocities of this character.  The closest comparison might be to the movie \\"Hellraiser: Inferno\\" which in my interpretation puts a lot of its focus on looking at the horrible and tragic dichotomy between the kind of person that could (/was meant to?) exist and the crapbag that instead stands in his place.A harsh term perhaps, but one that certainly applies to the villain I'm referring to in \\"Lost Boy Lost Girl\\". <br /> <br />None of this is to say that the book sacrifices any iota of its ability to be a hugely entertaining, thrilling, scary, and touching horror masterpiece for the sake of the 'message' parts of the book, or vice versa.  The memorable and hugely rewarding story and the intriguing philosphical meanings and points are all inseperable from one another, woven into a book that is a tale to make a lasting impression on the psyche. And along with the disturbing revelations so central to so much great horror, there are beautiful secrets waiting to be discovered as well, both by the book's characters and its readers.  Tremendously recommended for all who can withstand the most gruesome and darkly intense parts of its being.	2005-08-25
US	32728453	R3KJJSWHCGX41B	1400062527	623020428	In the Night Room	Books	5	3	8	N	N	It Does The Impossible - It Eclipses "Lost Boy Lost Girl"	As awesomely good as \\"Lost Boy Lost Girl\\" (\\"In The Night Room\\"'s predecessor) was, this book is, incredible as it may sound, even better.  \\"Lost Boy Lost Girl\\" was extremely high quality throughout but reached by far its greatest potency in only the last one quarter or so (for not one but several of the greatest climaxes in novel history); \\"In The Night Room\\" hits that same level from Page 1 and doesn't let up in the entire book, not even for a single sentence.  And like \\"Lost Boy Lost Girl\\" its excellence doesn't even end after the final sentence, you continue to absorb it even after the cover is closed, like a great movie whose full impact continues to just mount and mount upon one even as the final credits roll. <br /> <br />It's a sequel to \\"Lost Boy Lost Girl\\" but in a most bizarre way.  In the world in which \\"In The Night Room\\" takes place, \\"Lost Boy Lost Girl\\" is a novel and its author is a character in this book; to say more would simply reveal too much of the metaphysical goings-on in these pages.  It involves emails from the dead pleading for help, it involves a woman's search for the child everybody says died but who she is convinced is still alive, and it involves so much more (some of its aspects not appearing until quite far in) that, again, I think shouldn't be hinted at.  Very open to interpretation and very thought-provoking.  \\"In The Night Room\\" has some of the greatest characters it's ever been my pleasure to read of.  And \\"In The Night Room\\" is also possibly the scariest, most haunting and chilling novel I've ever read.  Repeatedly I had to remind myself that this is just a novel, a work of brilliant imagination, and it's not real.  That's happened occasionally with different books, but repeatedly?  All the way through?  Never before, not even with \\"The Exorcist\\"; not even with \\"Carrie\\".  And yet, paradoxically, parts of this book are of a nature that, as with the very different novels \\"The Gnole\\" and \\"Duncton Wood\\", I want those Parts so desperately to Be real.  Such is the enigmatic nature of this enigmatic masterpiece. <br /> <br />I rate this beyond an A+, and hope fervently that this isn't the final installment in what just may turn out to be horror noveldom's greatest cycle (Straub and Stephen King's collobaration on \\"The Talisman\\" and its \\"Black House\\" sequel may give it some competion there but Great Scott, talk about a horse race).  One of the best books ever, period.	2005-08-25
US	32728453	R2P1Z0D54KQC7J	0394588169	392304217	Jurassic Park	Books	5	108	111	N	N	Smart And Thought-Provoking With Dinosaur-Sized Thrills	Although all three of the \\"Jurassic Park\\" movies were visually spectacular, and although Crichton's \\"Lost World\\" followup was a good novel, in my opinion you have to go here, to the original \\"Jurassic Park\\" novel, to experience the true greatness of this story. <br /> <br />   Probably just about everybody knows the basic premise - scientists clone dinosaurs to create a massive theme park on a tropical island, and everything goes terribly awry.  What may have been forgotten in the years since its initial release is that this is one of the most thrilling, imagination-igniting, adventurous and frighteningly Believable (an aspect which didn't quite make it through to the film versions; most of the ethical questions, pro and con, also struggled to be heard in the movies) novels ever written.  In quoting early on actual tinkerings with the biological makeup of living things for man's scientific curiosity and potential profit, the book made it seem not only plausible that this could happen, but that, if this was in Any Way possible that it could happen, that someday, somehow, somebody is actually going to go and do something like this.  Not necesarily a dinosaur theme park (although who knows?) but some kind of cloning/genetic engineering scheme on this gargantuan scale.  And this book was written Before humanity started cloning sheep, cats, dogs and whatever else strikes its fancy (with huge rates of failure in terms of deformities and early deaths that just get swept under the rug), before the longtime specter of genetically engineering 'designer children' started to become feasible, and, if I have my dates right, before it was known that if somebody wanted to go ahead and attempt this we don't even need to go through amber-trapped insects for prehistoric DNA; we already have reasonably well-preserved, non-fossilized dinosaur marrow.  And the scientific community has been openly talking for years now about cloning mammoths from fresh specimens that were frozen in thelast ice age. <br /> <br />  To get off the subject of the book's plausibility and its connection to current real-life states of affairs in ethical and scientific circumstances, and get back to the book's own merits, this is one of Crichton's alltime gems.  Vivid desciptions of everything that make you feel like you're there, deeper and better characterization than in some of his earlier works, and some of the most amazing chase scenes and 'first appearance' of the monster' type scenes ever written, with more implied 'what if's and (that the author wisely doesn't than you can shake a Sauropod tail at.  It's also worth noting that not all of the dinosaurs are ferocious; some are non-threatening, even charmingly oafish. <br /> <br />Captivating from the get-go; hand a copy of this to a person who's never willingly (that means school assignments excluded) read a full novel and you might get a book-lover for life.  Other recommended Crichton titles: \\"The Andromeda Strain\\", \\"Sphere\\" and especially \\"Congo\\" (his other crowning achievement).  Also recommended in the dinosaur novel genre: \\"Raptor Red\\" by Robert T. Bakker, taking place in the Cretaceous.   \\"Balook\\" by Piers Anthony is another great book, involving prehistoric mammals instead of dinosaurs, and offering one of the few reasonable theoretical arguements in favor of cloning I've ever encountered.	2005-08-10
US	32728453	ROTAD96CKW2NV	0375504397	237509158	Black House: A Novel	Books	5	2	3	N	N	One Of The Most Indispensable Horror Novels; Some Of The Greatest Characters In Novel History	Years after the events of its precessor \\"The Talisman\\", \\"Black House\\" opens up in a small Wisconsin community called French Landing, and the cluster of other small towns and villages in its vicinity, to which Jack Sawyer, \\"The Talisman\\"'s primary protagonist, has retired after an uncharacteristically short but brilliant career with the Los Angeles County police force.  On this hot summer a couple of years after which Jack has relocated to try and find inner peace, the situation in French Landing and the surrounding area is anthing but peaceful, as a child-abducting predator dubbed 'The Fisherman' by the media has commenced a reign of horror.  This is a disturbing, gruesome book that is going to turn some readers off in the early going, but when you keep going you'll find that there's a surprising amount of brightness and even plentiful comedic relief in addition to some of the darkest material either King or Straub have put to paper, as well as - in the tradition of \\"The Talisman\\" - a cast of some of the most intensely likable and unforgettable characters you'll ever encounter. <br /> <br />   I think that right after reading it I mentally counted approximately 14 characters who could have emerged as the central figure in a full-length novel, 14 characters who I wanted to read more about and who entered into the pantheon of all-time memorable characters.  Although Jack is probably the main pivot point of the book, \\"Black House\\" is far from a one man show.  Much more of an ensemble cast than the classic \\"Talisman\\" (where Jack and Wolf unquestionably dominated the book), no one figure here can claim sole ownership of the 'main character' slot; so rich and lasting an impression do the book's other players - both other leads and characters who, by their page time should come off as 'supporting characters' but emerge as something more -make. <br /> <br />  The Talisman connections do not come into play for a considerable time; after so much time back in 'our' world Jack has become oddly amnesiac about his time in the Territories, convinced that what fragments he does remember are only his imagination, and only in the back of his subconcious is he truly aware of how much of a hole in his being his forgetfulness of what he previously experienced has left.  The connections do enter in full force eventually, as do connections to other novels in the repertoire of one or both of the book's authors (I prefer not to say which and to leave it to the reader to discover on their own; besides which I haven't yet read the Full repertoire  of either writer and there may be other links which I'm missing).  There a Lot of protagonists, or heroes, in this novel, although the latter term doesn't seem to be in vogue for describing characters in novels these days, the Fantasy field excluded; there are some of the most despicable villains imagineable; and there are those in the middle ground, although what sets \\"Black House\\" apart in this aspect is that most (not all) of the 'middle ground' characters lean much more in the direction of likable and basically good despite their shortcomings. <br /> <br />  It's a book of surprises which I prefer not to even hint it.  It's a book of both nightmares and dreams.  And it's a book written in an extremely unique narrative style - the vast majority of novels are of course, either first person (singular; 'I was doing this and then I saw...\\") or third person.  Here it's written in what I guess would be called first person plural, although the narrator(s) do not actively take part in the proceedings, but talk directly to the reader, in essence making him or her almost a part of the first person plural perspective.  Examples - as it's describing the lay of the land and the town here's a brief excerpt: \\"Moving toward the sun, we glide away from the river and over the shining tracks, the backyards and roofs of Nailhouse Row, then a line of Harley-Davidson motorcyles tilted on their kickstands.\\"  From the same page: \\"They get an ironic pleasure from being called the Thunder Five: the name strikes them as sweetly cartoonish.  What they call themselves is \\"the Hegelian scum.\\"  These gentlemen form an interesting crew and we will make their acquantaince later on.\\"  Or just a couple of pages later...actually I don't think I'll quote any more passages directly; the above are just to give you an idea.  For long stretches the book could well be a third person narrative but then that same peculiar style flows back in, sometimes brilliantly describing a reaction \\"we\\", as the book refers, are having to a scene, which I found dead-on with my own feelings as going through certain passages.  A daring and supremely innovative way to present a tale, and it works absolutely flawlessly. <br /> <br />This is one of the very pinnacles of horror fiction and one of the greatest examples of the art of literature at its peak.  Does not drag or limp for even a sentence of its 500+ pages, and gets the highest possible recommendation I can give it, although tempered with a warning for those who steer clear of graphic carnage.  A-Plus.	2005-08-10
US	32728453	RNFYELPR87CEJ	0670691992	122553244	The Talisman	Books	5	74	89	N	N	One Of The Greatest Novels Ever	A little while ago I did a writeup for Clive Barker's \\"Weaveworld\\" and said it may be the best blend of the horror novel and the fantasy novel ever.  While I stand by that 'may be' it occurs to me now that I should have also mentioned \\"The Talisman\\" as a voraciously strong contender for that title. <br /> <br />It's about a lot of things, including the existance of paralell realities overlaying one another and what happens in one of them also affecting what happens in the other (or others?) but perhaps the best way to describe the slice in space and time in this stunningly realized Universe (Multiverse?) we're taken to in \\"The Talisman\\" is to say that it's about a young boy named Jack who's mother is dying, and to save her he has to go on a journey to obtain a mystical artifact (the title 'Talisman'), and his mother's counterpart is also dying.  And she's the Queen of one of Earth's parralell selves.  This may sound like the basis for a 'Y.A.' novel a la \\"Harry Potter\\" or \\"Abarat\\" but it's not, this novel is graphic and brutal through much of its run.  It also contains some of the very best of the worlds of charm and whimsey and wonder at other times.  Jack is possessed of the ability to 'flip' from one world to the other, and the novel spends time in each.  Items from one world, as well as people, have their counterparts in the other world as well, but in different forms.  What is a house in one world could well be a hut or a castle or a tent in another.  Magic is far stronger on the 'other' world, technology more prevelant in 'ours', but each exist in both.  One of the characters encountered by Jack during his time in the other world (aka The Territories) is Wolf, a member of a race of non-evil werewolves, and this is one of the most instantly engaging and lovable characters the world of storytelling has ever brought to us.   <br /> <br />Sometimes, in between the time when I first read a book and the time I may eventually re-read it again years later, I like to refamilirize myself with old favorites as I rearrange them on their shelves, flipping through the pages here and there, occasionally reading a couple of paragraphs, and bringing the memories coming back.  This is a book that it's hard to do just that with, because perusing just a few lines can compel you to go on for pages and pages.  It reminds me of when I was first getting into novels bigtime, and this book defined 'Impossible To Put Down', keeping me going for hours past midnight, by far the longest I'd ever read in one sitting at that point.  For several chapters straight the suspense was just so unbelievable it was unthinkable to stop, all leading up to a climax (in the middle of the book; this tale has not one but several climaxes) that still stands as one of the most earthshaking in history. <br /> <br />Complete in itself but tying into other tales (and directly sequelized in the equally awesome \\"Black House\\"), this is just incredible, one of the very best for either author certainly.  As a gratuitous plug, I'd also just like to say this: probably many times more readers came to this book through their familiarity with Stephen King than Peter Straub (I was one of them).  If you've read lots of King but your only Straubs are these colloborations deny yourself no longer: his best solo books are every bit as good as King's best solos, and the very best stand of either stand up with \\"Talisman\\" and \\"Black House\\".	2005-08-02
US	32728453	R1S4HC28ZZASPY	0743417356	257613214	Weaveworld	Books	5	7	11	N	N	Possibly The Best Fusion Of The Fantasy Novel And The Horror Novel	\\"Weaveworld\\" is a book unlike any other, in either its lineage of the horror and fantasy fields, or anywhere else in literature.  It's about an entire world woven into the fabric of a magic carpet, that is found by two unconnected people, Cal and Suzanna, and the series of events the discovery takes them on.  It's about the race that made the Weaveworld, and their flight from the Scourge that seeks to destroy their kind.  It has the kind of romance I think almost all of us dream of at some point, of coming together with someone in the midst of the discovery of things both wonderful and great, and other discoveries dark and terrifying; a romance set against the backdrop of great adventure and danger and exotic discovery.  Cal and Suzanna, through their discovery of the carpet, not only eventually come into contact with the Scourge but with a number of other dangerous beings looking for the Weaveworld, including two especially memorable figures named the Immacolata and Shadwell. <br /> <br />A number of the book's protagonists (and there are a number of protagonists, not just Cal and Suzanna) are not lily-white perfect but quite flawed, more so than the leads of say, \\"Sacrament\\" or the younger-themed \\"Thief Of Always\\"; Barker is one of the greatest authors in the world in being able to make flawed central figures very interesting and likable, not irritating.  He also excels - in his general body of work - in taking them through journeys from which they can emerge either better or worse.  Likewise, \\"Weaveworld\\" presents some villains who are truly Heinous, but who in some cases we come to empathise with as we learn more about them - not neccesarily to like them in all cases, but to understand.  There's something potent in here about adding some redeeming virtues to most of the villains, and adding some flaw to most (but not all) of the good guys, that conjures the familiar theme of the war between good and evil in every individual, and it feels very hopeful.  Barker's phenomenal use of the English language throughout is the work of a master wordsmith, and makes this a must-read for even those who don't normally go for fantasy or horror. <br /> <br />One warning: at some point in the book a revelation (which I won't hint it) may come up that might make some readers want to turn away from the book and leave it unfinished.  I'd strongly advise carrying on until the end - I'm not saying everything works out perfectly and I'm not saying things come out tragic but so magnificently done that it's still great, I'm just saying if those who are...not happy, I'll say....with one of the turns in this imaginative labyrinth of a book, stick with it til the end, I think you'll be glad you did. <br /> <br />One of Barker's greatest achievements.  Probably too graphic for the younger readers of Barker's \\"Y.A\\" works like \\"Abarat\\" and \\"Thief Of Always\\" (great reads for older readers too, by the way) but essential for fans of any of Barker's other works from \\"Sacrament\\" to \\"Lord Of Illusions\\" to \\"Hellraiser\\" and so on, and older readers of \\"Abarat\\" and the like.  Child fans of the \\"Y.A.\\" stuff maybe should wait a few years before tackling this?  In any event, it's a classic, a high credit to both Fantasy and Horror, and to the world of novels as a whole.	2005-07-24
US	32728453	R3IBI6BJB6MIX3	1401201962	603935183	Hawkman: Allies & Enemies	Books	5	4	5	N	N	6 Issues Of One Of Comicdom's Absolute Best Ongoings	Reprinting #s 7-12 of the current \\"Hawkman\\" series, \\"Allies & Enemies\\" covers a lot of ground, the various issues within taking on different ideas and being different kinds of books while still maintaining the coherency of the series. <br /> <br />  Number 7 is the 'Past Lives' issue, covering a pair of Hawkman and Hawkgirl's previous incarnations in the DC Universe, those of Nighthawk and Cinnamon in the Old West, two characters who actually previously existed in the DC Universe but, I believe, hadn't been used for years and years and who I don't think ever had any connection to the Hawks until this current series.  It's amazing how the Hawkman creative team is taking old and seldom-seen characters and making them into big parts of this series.  Great issue for Hawkman fans, great issue for those who bemoan the scant existance of Western comics (once so plentiful on the scene) on the scene today, great book period.  My only complaint is I would have liked the 'Past Lives' thing to run a few more issues, each book tackling a different period and set of incarnations.  There's so much to the backhistory (spanning thousands of years!) of these eternally reincarnated characters yet to tell - just one more reason to hope the series makes it to # 500 and beyond, to have room to fit everything in. <br /> <br />Numbers 8 and 9 are both 'junction' issues (tying in a number of plotlines - pre-established ones and hints of upcoming ones) and interpersonal issues, with The Atom getting feature treatment along with the regulars in # 8 (very fitting, since he and Hawkman once shared an ongoing title on a regular basis and Dr. Fate joining the stars on center stage in the ninth.  Both are dramatic, moving and exceptionally well done.  Number nine is also getting into increasingly disturbing territory, as details of Hawkgirl's harrowing past (in this lifetime) begin to come out.  Neither is going to over well with readers who prefer for every issue of each series to be all fighting and action, all the time.  I love the mammoth battles as much as anyone, but I love the kind of thing we get in these issues too.  Neither would be as effective without the other; the different atmospheres and different tones within a series play off one another and make the whole much better. <br /> <br />For numbers 10-12, there's less one can say without giving away plot points of earlier issues, both those in this book and in the previous 6 issues (aka the \\"Hawkman: Endless Flight\\" Trade Paperback).  Suffice it to say they're more high adventure-oriented, they continue the trend of taking the Hawkman series to locales less seen in the DCU by going to the Himalayas and yes, the yetis are here.  Some of the best-looking yetis ever drawn, ensorceled by evil magic into a deadly fighting force. <br /> <br />Needless to say (if you're familiar with the series at all) the art is impeccable.  The supporting cast continues to grow and come more and more alive with each issue.  And the Hawks are becoming as integral a part of the overall DC Universe as Superman and Batman. <br /> <br />Outstanding; extremely recommended.	2005-07-07
US	32728453	R223OTYI220A75	0785107584	624095595	Thor Visionaries - Walt Simonson, Vol. 1 (v. 1, Bk. 1)	Books	5	8	9	N	N	Until I Read This Book, I Never Realized How Great Thor Could Be	Before getting this Trade Paperback (which reprints Thor #s 337-348) most of my familiarity with Thor came from \\"The Avengers\\" and I hadn't often encountered characters like Balder The Brave, Lorelei and Beta Ray Bill outside of \\"The Official Handbook To The Marvel Universe\\" and such.  After reading the run of the book though I'm ready to hail Thor as one of Marvel's top heroes, and was surprised at how fantastic and well-developed the rest of the cast is. <br /> <br />  The first issue reprinted begins with a mysterious prologue involving a massive, fiery, hammer-wielding monstrous figure (most readers already know who I'm talking about I'm sure; for those with relatively little knowledge of the Thor/Asgardian mythology corner of the Marvel Universe I'll refrain from using his name), going about his dark machinations \\"far beyond the fields we know\\" [in] \\"the core of an ancient galaxy\\".  From there the saga gets going with a bang, with the arrival of an alien (one of the coolest looking aliens I've ever seen by the way) going by the unlikely name of Beta Ray Bill arriving in our section of space, mistaking the Mighty Thor for one of a horde of demons the alien is locked in war with, and eventually through a rapidfire chain of events Becoming an entirely NEW Thor for the Marvel Universe. <br /> <br />The partnership of the Thors, the machinations of the fire demon, the grandeur of Odin, various romantic angles, the last viking, often superb dialogue, ample humour, some surpringly sexy scenes (given the time the original issues were first published), the awakening of a 'dark elf' and the truly epic saga unfolding of Balder as one of Marvel's greatest 'supporting' characters are just a few of the elements in this volume that make it so essential. <br /> <br />There is a problem with the art.  It has nothing to do with the skill of the penciller, inkers, or colorists.  It's just that when the issues reprinted here were first published back in - the early to mid eighties, I believe - the printing processes, the coloring processes in particular, didn't always lend themselves to detailed, vivid artwork quite as well as what would become the norm for comic publishers a few years later.  For example, in certain scenes the facial features of characters who appear small on the page because of distance or because they're full figure in a small panel or whatever, lose their distinctiveness.  The book still looks great 99.5% of the time, but I feel with the talent of the artists involved it would have looked even better if there had been access to the superior art reproduction techniques back then.  They did accomplish some magnificent effects with shading though. <br /> <br />Also be on the lookout for one of the best surprise appearances by a character in comics history, in issue 341 (Chapter 5 of this book). <br /> <br />9/10.   Bottom line: if you're considering whether you should add this material to your library, I think the Thunder God himself says it best: \\"Aye, Verily.\\"	2005-07-07
US	32728453	R3I3X2X404FCXJ	0425158594	545448747	Demon Seed	Books	5	0	0	N	N	Thrilling Technological Horror With Questions Of Philosophy & Ethics	This is the rewritten 1997 version of Koontz's 1973 \\"Demon Seed\\", incorporating such modern developments as the internet and 'advances' in genetic engineering into the basic concept of a sentient computer obsessed with/in love with a woman (depending on your point of view, and perhaps apt to change back and forth a couple of times during the novel) who takes control of her state-of-the-art home and keeps her prisoner.  I've never read the original version so I can't offer any take on how well the 2 compare to one another. <br /> <br />\\"Demon Seed\\" is written entirely in the first person from the point of view of the living computer.  The book succeeds in doing what many first person narratives have difficuly with when they try it - that is, revealing insights and slants on the narrator (the computer)'s character and motivations that he/it doesn't seem to be aware of in itself.  The same holds true for some of the other characters - the computer describes the individuals perfectly but does not always seem to 'get' what it's describing, and is unaware of that in itself. <br /> <br />Without going into happenings beyond the first half of the book, the computer seems not to lack a sense of right and wrong, but to be completely skewed, unknowingly confused, in its perceptions of the concepts and where each apply.  In many tales of superintelligent living machines that wreak all kinds of havoc and/or deception, the story omits the point that it is invariably mankind that has created the machine, has endowed it with all manner of intellect and ability and senses - generally leading to the development (whether its human makers intended it or not) of emotions - and all the while humanity has simply forgotten about the need to teach it anything of concepts like compassion, love, justice, etc.  Modern science often seems to view all these as completely subjective, even irrelevant in intellectual discussions, so this omission on the part of the 'makers' is entirely plausible.  In this case it's been inadvertantly left to this newly sentient lifeform to come up with its own versions of the above concepts from scratch, and its own ideas on what would and would not be acceptable in attaining the ambitions and desires it develops.  It's very poignant and very tragic, which is not to negate the effects of the more dangerous and ruthless traits the computer develops.  What's especially tragic (and this is revealed early on in the narrator's discussions on its worldview) is that it would probably be apalled and possibly view as evil (it's adamant in its stance on the individual's right to freedom yet is an abductor itself) some of its own actions if it observed them in a third party, but is incapable of seeing them in itself, in its drive for - as cliche as it may sound - love, understanding, and an end to being the only one of its kind.  I wonder how this book would have played out had its main character opted for different ends to its means? <br /> <br />Of course, as the tale progresses, new elements come shockingly into play, and I'm not even going to discuss them or whether or not they add to or debunk the way I was interpreting the book in the earlier going, I'll just say that it doesn't take away from the book's status as a true great. <br /> <br />In talking so much about the menacing computer I've given short shrift to Susan, the story's human protagonist.  She's a great character, exactly what the book called for and among the best and most engaging of Koontz's protagonists, which is saying quite a lot.  She's emerging from her own traumas, and ironically, it seems to be the computer's very sympathy for this individual that leads it to select her as its target, genuinely thinking that its plans for her will be some kind of boon for her healing.  This is a mixed-up computer, as mixed-up as it is intelligent, and that's a supremely dangerous combination. <br /> <br />Reccommended not just for Koontz fans and horror fans in general; readers of science fiction and Crichton-style technothrillers should definately get this one as well.  One of Dean Koontz's best.	2005-07-07

Fitting in with the time frame, Superman and most of the other characters (with the notable exception of Batman, who more resembles his current self) in the saga are much more in keeping with their decades-ago incarnations than their current post-Crisis selves, with Superman light years more powerful than in current continuity (back to the days when he was practically omnipotent) and Lex Luthor seeming to be about ten times smarter than Einstein and Hawking combined.  I don't think these characterizations/attributes could ever fly (no pun intended) on a long-term basis in the modern, highly-detailed and plausibilty-concerned universes, but it has proved to work spectacularly in a self-contained Elseworlds tale such as this. <br /> <br />Random high points: there are so many open-to-interpretation/subtext points it would be impossible to mention them all here (besides it would give away pretty much the whole story) but it does provide invigorating fodder for conversation and wonder.  There are a host of familiar DCU characters who turn up along the way, some in major roles and for others small cameos, and again it would be grossly unfair to give even a partial list of the surprise players here.  And the art and the way it conveys what's going on inside the character's minds without a word in some panels - you'll see a prime example when you get to Pages 134-135 near the end of the book; if this was a movie the actors would deserve awards for conveying so much and with such force.  And finally, only rarely does the tale go where one would expect it to; truly one of the more unpredictable epics out there. <br /> <br />Possibly THE indispensable Elseworlds.	2005-06-22

Occuring in Africa, in North America, the Middle East, France - pretty much over most of the planet - through the Ice Age, the Chinese Dynasties, the Stone Age and numerous other specific times and places, ascending from the most distant to the most recent and finally into the year 2021.  It does a remarkable job of putting one right in the moment, making distant, mammoth-and-sabretooth-inhabited wildernesses and long-ago exotic cultures very real and immersive.  The barbarities of the human race over the edges are present, but more memorable are the benevolences - a meeting between early modern man and Neanderthals where the Homo Sapiens representative is surprised to learn that the 'beast-men' are not the bloodthirsty mindless savages the sapiens think of them as; a simple but highly moving burial scene; and the instances of powerful romance - particularly romances that last through the centuries and transcend lifetimes - are among the highlights.  Generally written in great detail, the narrative does occasionally fall into choppy sentence structure - which can be effective in some action sequences to convey the rapidity of events but is much less so at other times - and excessive use of exclamation points, but any hampering effects these slips might have had on the overall story are dashed by the power, fascination, and/or beauty of the individual scene and a generally quick return to a more descriptive and effective writing style.  Overall, a book of great insight, imagination, supposition and substance.	2005-01-09

The exclusion of said material, excellent though it is, is not enough to justify bumping this down from five stars to four; besides, all DC has to do is start issuing Trade Paperbacks reprinting the Detective backups like they've done for the Black-&-White backups from Gotham Knights (another outstanding title) and problem solved, you don't have to worry about missing any material when you purchase Trades like this or \\"Officer Down\\" or \\"Fugitive\\".  What really mystifies me though, is if this is billed as 'New Gotham 1', why they didn't start the volume off by reprinting Detective # 742, THE perfect post-No Man's Land starting point, an issue largely focusing on Jim Gordon and the reprecussions of the final issues of NML.  I definately recommend that issue in addition to this volume, as it sets the stage well for the whole post-NML Batman material in many of the titles, not just Detective. <br /> <br />    Onto the material that is reprinted itself - issues 743-746 bring the detective skills of the Bat into center stage as he investigates the prescence and intentions of Whisper A'Daire and Kyle Abbot in Gotham, two new (to the reader) agents of the Demon's Head, Ra's Al Ghul.  743-746 also give considerable play to many of Gotham's 'non-costumed' organized crime elements, and does so with great characterization and realism.  # 747 is a stand-alone issue in which Batman is pretty much a cameo player, in an issue starring GCPD officer Rene Montoya and Two-Face; possibly one of the 5 best single-issue Batman stories ever published; actually I'd go even further and say it's possibly one of the 5 best self-contained comics, period.  Detective Nos. 748 & 749, 'Urban Renewal' Parts 1 & 2, see the tense friction between the Dee-Zees (residents who left Gotham after the No Man's Land declaration and returned after it was lifted) and OGs (Original Gothamites, who stayed in the city during the whole crisis) escalating into violence; also brings in details on how the actual rebuilding of the city is proceeding.  And Detective Comics # 750 is a follow-up to the arc in 743-746, brilliant but containing one small implausibility, the only one in the collection.  To focus too much on that would be nitpicking on the molecular level given the overall awesomeness of the issue and the collection. <br /> <br />   The artwork is tremendous, one of the few examples of veering into the highly stylized realm of art (rather than going for a fully photorealistic style) that I find totally rewarding and expressive on every level.  And it's not that it's blatantly UN-photorealistic, it's just that this is a really unique, really innovative pencil style.  If the drawing style is innovative, the coloring style is downright revolutionary, casting each individual issue in pre-dominantly in a single primary color and its multitude of shades, plus black, white and grey.  A bold move that succeeded magnificently and worked with the pencils and inks for one of the most original looks on any comic title in years and years. <br /> <br />   Tremendous, riveting, outstanding, and unpredictable, I'll stop now before I use too much bandwidth with thousands of praiseful adjectives.	2004-12-18

Long after the 'Great White' that destroyed the previous planetary civilization, some people are being born with special powers that usually manifest years into life.  Called Misfits, they were once all killed off, but in the timeframe of the novel, \\"all but the most horribly afflicted\\" are being rounded up and used as glorified slave labor, resulting in Misfits generally trying to keep their natures hidden.  It is to an 'orphanage' for such individuals - the titular Obernewtyn - that the novel's main heroine Elspeth is sent, and the dark, mysterious and foreboding nature of the place conjures up images of another genre - a subtle, older-styled horror movie or novel.  Add to this plentiful drama, and Elspeth and her allies - including a highly intelligent cat named Maruman who Elspeth can communicate with telepathically - and you have a first-rate novel, descriptively written with flair and equally driven by characters and concept.  Superb first volume of a saga, with welcome suspense and originality.	2004-12-16

In the two-volume trade paperback form, though, it is somewhat hampered by the fact that not all of the chapters are present - they've endeavored to get the 'main' chapters in here, but there are a large number of other issues (apparantly considered 'peripheral' to the overall story) that were omitted.  The reader can still, of course, buy the issues not reprinted here separately, but it's still a major (and rare) misstep for DC to have not made this collection a set of three larger trade paperbacks to have the complete saga represented.  My advice is to buy the trades anyway and try to get as many of the other OWAW tie-ins as possible too.  Despite the mishandling of the presentation, I can't bring myself to give this anything less 5 stars. <br /> <br />  I myself have read most of the crossover but have yet to secure a couple of issues from the early going; I have the \\"Volume 2\\" Trade Paperback and a slew of individual issues from the first half of the event, plus issues from the second half that actually fit in 'in between' individual issues reprinted here.  I really wanted to review \\"Volume One\\" as well, but I don't have every issue reprinted within (even though overall I have most of the first half, including issues not reprinted in trade form).  Some of the Trade Paperbacks I've done writeups on I have done based on the original issues reprinted (as opposed to the TPB format), but only when I have the complete material.  I don't with OWAW Vol. 1, so I'll have to just do a writeup for this volume. <br /> <br />   Now the crossover itself (if you're still reading, thanks for putting up with that preamble) - this is bigger and more far-ranging than any event DC has done since at least \\"Zero Hour\\", bigger even than \\"The Final Night\\" - far bigger in fact since this is a galactic, time-spanning conflagration that threatens to eventually consume the whole universe, and it crossed into numerous titles (although the title of the TPBs would imply it's an entirely Superman-oriented event that's not really true - the Man Of Steel and his cast play the biggest role but it involves just about all the main characters of the DCU.  This volume actually does a better job of presenting a wider cross-section of the books involved than Volume 1 did).  The great adversary of the event is Imperiex, a Galactus-level character who commands legions of \\"Imperiex Probes\\" that are basically smaller, non-sentient versions of himself, each of them powerful enough to alone be a challenge to Superman.  Opposing this world-destroying entity is a vast coalition of planets, into which Earth is inducted at the beginning of the event.  So great is the threat that not only have worlds like Almerac and Tamaran and the survivors of Kalanor (Despero's homeworld), destroyed by Imperiex prior to the OWAW Volume 1 TPB at the beginning of \\"Superman: Or Worlds At War Secret Files # 1\\", (which REALLY should have been included in the first trade), have come together, but even Apokolips itself is in on the alliance!  Other players come into the fray very unexpectedly in this volume, and are best let unrevealed for the reader to discover on their own. <br /> <br />   Clearly, this is not an 'introductory' book to Superman or the DC Universe - it's very complex and of necessity assumes a familiarity by the reader with a great number of characters, races and concepts; a saga for fans already deeply and passionately into the DC Universe.  If you're not a Superman reader this crossover isn't the place to start - the \\"Superman: No Limits\\" trade paperback, reprinting material from a couple years earlier when DC did one of their periodic 'jumping-on' points to make it easier for new readers to come onboard, would be a good choice and fairly recent place to start off if you want to get into the comics - using this as a starting point would be kind of like starting off on \\"Lord Of The Rings\\" with the third novel (except of course that's the final novel, and there is no 'final chapter' to things like the DC Universe or Marvel Universe, and, God willing, never will be). <br /> <br />   There is massive destruction in the event, more than in \\"Lord Of the Rings\\", the whole \\"Star Wars\\" saga, and \\"Independance Day\\" put together, and thankfully it's Felt by the characters, it's not like some action movies where everything blows up but nobody seems emotionally affected by it.  Younger Superman fans might be better off going with some DVDs from the animated series of a few years ago, than something this intense and technical.  People who don't read comics are unaware of how much there is to them these days in terms of intense action, drama, social issues, massive complexity, etc.  There's also alot of humor, lightness, fun, etc. but OWAW is an example of how thunderous and grand-scoped they can get.  All this is expertly brought to life by the writers and artists, to the point where you can practically hear the lava plumes of Apokolips.   <br /> <br />   An excellent book this Volume 2 is, though of course anyone reading it should go with the Trade Paperback/OWAW issues that preceded it.  One of the best of the 'giant-sized' crossovers, up there with the Batman \\"No Man's Land\\" event and Marvel's X-Men \\"Age Of Apocalypse\\" saga from a few years back. <br /> <br />	2004-11-23
US	32728453	RIC8LBINL4MCM	0002243954	843523115	The White Bone	Books	5	7	8	N	N	Elephant Epic	One way of looking at \\"The White Bone\\" is to think of as following the conventions of much of the best of epic fantasy.  A threatened race, dependant on the hope of a youth born with superior powers, destined to find a sacred artifact that will lead her people from the monsters that prey on them, through turmoil and hardship to a promised land, encountering fascinating creatures along the way.  However, \\"The White Bone\\" is not fantasy -it's a harrowing, tragic and dramatic story - and it's real.  The characters may be made up, and certain plot points (like the sacred object: the fabled White Bone of the title) but the basics are true.  The threatened race is the elephant race, the monsters that prey on them are human poachers, the journey the group treks on is through Africa, and the creatures they encounter are mongooses, rhinoceroses, ostritches, etc. <br /> <br />   The heroine in the book, and one of the great heroines in all the field of novels, is Mud, a young elephant orphaned at birth.  The elephants have their own religion, their own worldview, their own stories handed down through the generations.  Through the book we also get briefer glimpses of the worldviews of other species.  The worldviews of the enigmatic hindleggers (the elephants's term for humans) is unknown; for, although each group of elephants has a mind-talker who can communicate telepathically with most creatures, thus learning of their perceptions of the world and their thoughts and feelings, to share with the other elephants, the minds of humans are unreadable.  The mind-talkers hear from certain other animals they can't communicate with only what is described as a 'faint chiming'; from humans though comes a hideous absolute silence that can be deeply traumatic to encounter.  The mind-talker in the main group of elephants is Date Bed, a shy younger elephant who clings to Mud.  These two, along with the bull elephant Tall Time, comprise the three central characters of the story. <br /> <br/>   It's hard to say how much of the elephant culture and worldview depicted in the novel paralells the minds of real elephants, but it's likely alot closer than the traditional scientific view (now thankfully being abandoned in whole or in part by many scientists) of elephants and all non-human creatures as basically automatons driven solely by biological instinct and completely or virtually devoid of thought or emotion.  Whatever the case may be, this involving, vividly written, detailed and character-driven epic gives fascinating glimpses at how other lifeforms may view things; and a disturbing look at how humanity does indeed conduct itself amongst its fellow species.	2004-11-21

As phenomenal as the rest of the series, with the very, very minor reduction in the intricacy of the pencilwork displayed more than made up for by a chance to see Gon and his world rendered in vivid color.  The diminutive dinosaur shines here, doing what he does best - befriending creatures of all manner, defending his friends from adversity, predators and downright bullies, enjoying life to the fullest (he takes such immense pleasure in things like savoring the taste of a piece of fruit, in a way the world at large seems to have forgotten how to), and continuing his long-running rival with a particular bear known throughout the Gon series simply as 'The Bear', begun in the very first Gon book when Gon takes offense at 'The Bear' bullying a smaller bear out of his catch of fish.  (It's worth noting that only one bear goes by the name 'The Bear'; all other bears seem to have been assigned other names, such as 'King Bear' and 'Little Teddy'. It's also worth noting that despite the titanic nature of their struggles - with 'The Bear' inevitably coming out on the losing end - nobody ever gets seriously injured.  Such is part of the charm of the Gon series).  Touching, hilarious and exhiliratingly enjoyable as always.  Features the tales \\"Gon Is Very Sleepy\\", \\"Gon's Archenemy, The Bear\\", \\"Gon Meets King Bear\\", \\"Gon Becomes Electric Gon\\" (one of the most wonderfully moving tales in his pantheon), \\"Gon Meets Little Teddy\\" and \\"Gon Has Big Antlers\\".

US	32728453	R2YNBKQG4GPARO	0671024434	693749823	I, Q (Star Trek The Next Generation)	Books	5	5	6	N	N	The Best Star Trek Novel I've Ever Read	I haven't read as many Star Trek novels as many Trek fans probably have, but of the ones I have read, \\"I, Q\\" is easily the best, the first trek novel to fully equal the very best installments of any of the television series or the best movies.  Though I'd read good Treks before, to be honest before reading this I was almost tempted to  give up on the novels as a whole, with some of the recent ones I'd read having been major disappointments.  There have been some very good ones over the years, but there have also been those that introduce tremendous concepts and then steadily peter out over the course of ensuing chapters, or books that read like very promising first drafts but appear to have been published prematurely, without the extra reworkings required to make them truly well-realized stories.  That's just my personal opinion; I know there are readers who devour trek novel after trek novel voraciously and are very pleased with all of them, but a number of them just haven't done much for me.  Just personal preferences, I guess.  Besides, with literally hundreds of Star Treks published, it would be unrealistic to expect every single one of them to be a gem. <br /> <br />  \\"I, Q\\" is a gem though.  It's narrated first person by Q, which is a risky venture.  Done poorly, this could have been a blight on one of Star Trek's greatest characters.  And how could it really be done well?  Onscreen appearances are one thing, but how can a novel get inside the head of a pretty-much-omniscient character in first person format and hope to do justice to their inner workings?  A built-in safety device is present with Q - he's an embellisher and an exaggerater (or a liar to call a spade a spade, albeit a charismatic and entertaining one), he simplifies certain things for the sake of readers whose minds he feels don't approach his own (throughout the narrative he speaks to the reader directly and manages to toss out insults and be hilarious at the same time) and he, by his own admission, makes certain changes for dramatic effect.  Thus, anything he says that doesn't strike the individual reader as faithful to established Trek tendencies can be easily written off as the entertaining ramblings (or boastings) of one of the universe's ultimate showmen. <br /> <br />    Personally, I think everything fits in perfectly.  This is the story of the dawn of an ultimate universal catacyslm, one even the Q-Continuim seems powerless to intervene against; disaster on an epic scale - imagine the Next Generation 2-parter \\"All Good Things Must Come To An End\\" taken to the Nth level for an idea of the magnitude.  Starting off light and witty, giving Q a chance to offer his perspective on everything from the nature of the universe to the human condition to the individual characters who populate the Star Trek universe - witness his introduction to the reader of Picard (this isn't giving anything away, it happens on page 14) - 'he is a middle-aged, bald, oddly accented man who oversees activities aboard the Starship Enterprise.  The Enterprise is a vessel belonging to an organization called Starfleet, and the Enterprise is the flagship of the fleet, which makes it the most advanced ant on the anthill.'  Hardly a typical introduction to Picard and Enterprise, but perfectly fitting coming from Q, and like the rest of the narration so easy to hear in Q's own voice.  We also witness a friendly debate between Picard and Data on the pros and cons of a goldfish's limited memory capacity, which presents a very surprising and thought-provoking way of pondering such matters, the kind of non-nihilistic philosophising one often finds in the best Treks and seems to go right over the heads of all the critics who dismiss the series as pap. <br /> <br />   Once the initial wit and boat-top verbal meanderings are over though, the cataclysm hits with startling tension, and the metaphysical adventure begins.  Q's acidy but humourous commentary continues, but it's now altered.  Much of the time, it's not what he says but what he doesn't say that is most intruiging, and at other points we find Q asserting certain points (like the fact that since he's omnipotent, he has nothing to fear) and certain things that he believes and doesn't believe, that it becomes very telling how he repeats these things more and more as the situation becomes more dire; initially it seems that he's trying to make sure that the reader is certain of his (Q's) convictions, but it later seems more likely that he's trying to convince himself.  Although this is a \\"Next Generation\\" novel, characters from elsewhere in the Trek universe make welcome appearances.  Also, the tale sums up the relationships between Q and Picardn (less antagonistic than one might think), Q and Data, and Picard and Data, better than anything I've encountered.  Q's surprisingly insightful take on the Picard/Data relationship in particular is compulsory reading for Trek fans, and Picard himself might be highly surprised were he privy to Q's take on the dynamics between he and Data. <br /> <br />    Star Trek has been called by some mindless entertainment.  I'll agree that it's highly entertaining, but mindless? (Sidestepping the question that never seems to occur to professional critics that doesn't one Need a mind to be entertained by anything in the first place?)  This novel of epic metaphysical imagination rips the mindless arguement to shreds.  (Doubters should also view, to name two, the Next Generation episode \\"The Survivors\\" and the Deep Space Nine episode \\"Marritza\\")  Trek's had a few rough patches lately, but reading this book a few months ago and the unexpected dramatic improvement of \\"Enterprise\\" (after a number of bumps it's suddenly consistently hitting Season One levels of quality again) has got me all fired up about the Trek mythos again.  \\"I, Q\\" is pure gold.	2004-11-21

In this book, gnomes, sprites, and the like are real, although quite different in appearance from traditional perceptions.  Also real are Gnoles - small furry bipeds with mole-like characteristics, who live hidden from the ever-encroaching human world by magical wards.  But it is into the terrifying world of man that the novel's main protagonist, the Gnole named Fungle Foxwit, must venture, sent on a mission by Molom, the Father Of Trees, to secure a magical stone of devastating power called Baphomet before it falls into the hands of either humanity or the demon Theverat who also seeks it, either of which could prove fatal for the world.       Aided by fellow gnole Neema Cleverbread and his loyal Gnome friend, Karbolic Earthcreep (Ka for short), as well as a host of other memorable characters, Fungle's journey into human civilization finds him undiscovered by man but, unxpectedly, becoming an instant global phenomenon beloved by the very species Gnoles are so wary of.  Meanwhile Theverat, and his personal assasin Thorn, loom...        There's way more to the book than this, and I've said enough already.  Suffice it to conclude by saying that this is one of the most magical, hilarious, spiritual, tragic, victorious and fantastical (yet eerily believable) books ever written.  I pray there's a sequel someday.        Also recommended: the novel \\"Duncton Wood\\" by William Horwood (though I should point out it's pretty graphically traumatic in places; probably not for younger readers), the movies \\"Fairy Tale: A True Story\\", \\"Castle In The Sky\\" and \\"My Neighbor Totoro\\", and the video game \\"Ecco The Dolphin: Defender Of The Future\\".	2004-11-20

Adventure, love, hate, destiny, terror, the mechanics of how evil arises both within a society and within an individual, romance, play, disaster, the clash of species, hope, faith, mystery, abyss-deep horror, nature and character.  And it's all from the perspective of moles.  Not utensil-using, clothes-wearing, machine-building moles, but real, furry, tunnel-burrowing moles.  There are a few unorthodox speculations - they know how to use herbs for medicinal purposes, they have stacks of bark chips whose scratches across the surface are the moles's own written history, etc. -  but they are not 'little humans in mole form'.  Centering around two moles in particular from their infancies onward, Bracken and Rebecca (yes, one of the main themes of this novel is a romance between two moles, and no, it's not remotely a children's book), it nonetheless has an extremely wide and diverse cast - studious, faith-rich, quietly brave scribe-mole Boswell, the devious and unspeakably evil Rune, the small, tender, and enderaingly-nervous Comfrey, the nurturing Rose, and the living darkness that is Mandrake, to name a few.  The only novel that equals \\"Duncton Wood\\" in array of all-time great characters is \\"The Gnole\\". <br /> <br />   Written with tremendous skill and heart, with surprises and not some but many of the most memorable scenes in the history of the written word, \\"Duncton Wood\\" is indispensable for fans of the novel format of storytelling.  Total excellence.	2004-10-27

Probably more rewarding if you've been long familiar with the entity known as Apocalypse, this could nonetheless serve as the first X-Men story you've ever read, taking place as it does entirely in ancient Egypt, eons before the formation of the X-Men or the births of Charles Xavier and Erik Lensherr, or even the dawn of Sinister (magnificently told in the \\"Further Adventures Of Cyclops And Phoenix\\" trade paperback, possibly THE greatest 4-issue mini-series Marvel has ever published).  Taking place at the beginning of the building of the pyramids, the book tells the tale of Apocalypse, aka En Sabah Nur, apparantly the first Homo Superior mutation in world history.  Chronicles a period of years, from his very beginnings as a newborn infant left by his tribe to die out in a sandstorm because of their fear of his mutated physical appearance to his dawn as early conqueror and the manifestation of the first hints of his true power potential.  It performs a difficult task in arousing sympathy for the character without diminishing the evil of what you know he's going to become.  For a few years Marvel had been making the mistake of turning almost all their top-tier villains good; it's good to do that sometimes, and it's good to have characters like Magneto and Doom who can often straddle the line between 'good guy' and 'bad guy' distinctions, but if you turn All your villains into straight-up 'good' characters, you're left with no adversaries higher than Tier 2.  This book makes one empathise with En Sabah Nur while superbly foreshadowing the eternal terror and bane onthe world he's to become, both making the character even more frightening and adding a previously undreamt-of air of tragedy. <br /> <br />   There is not a single appearance by any of the other main 'X-Men' characters, but the tale ingeniously weaves in the Fantastic Four by juxtaposing itself with an FF/Rama-Tut time travel story originally told in the 60s (I believe) and takes place in the exact same time frame without even a hint of contrivance.  The FF doesn't have a large role but Rama-Tut is a major player and fills his role perfectly. <br /> <br />    An outstanding book, amongst the best X-material in Trade Paperback form out there.  Definately among the best things Terry Kavanagh has ever written.	2004-10-27
US	32728453	R3SRBUT84ZW8XQ	B0006ED5KM	511631376	The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger	Books	4	0	0	N	N	Unique and High-Quality Saga Beginning	The first installment of Stephen King's \\"Dark Tower\\" saga takes place on a pseudo-old-western world of ghost towns and scattered settlements and vast, encroaching deserts, where saloon pianos play Beatles songs and other out-of-place (and time) elements keep creeping in, on a world apparantly descended from a much more advanced civilization.  An alternate world that apparantly faced some kind of global catastrophe and somehow re-emerged as a re-creation of the American Old West should come off very campy, but as you get into the book you quickly realize that it's not coming off that way at all, and the juxtaposition of believability on what should be absurdity results in an unnerving air, perhaps suggesting the breaking down of what we think of as reality, or the threads of fate knotted up in kinks. <br /> <br />   The heroes of the book are a ruthless gunslinger named Roland (constantly in pursuit of a mysterious 'man in black') and a boy named Jake from 'our' world who's somehow crossed over into this dessicated husk of a post-apocalyptic reality.  There are a lot of nasty, often detestable characters in here, many of them nominally on the side of good.  Included in this, though not to the extent of some of the others, is the title Gunslinger.  I usually don't like the 'selfish anti-hero' role, the supposed good guy who's willing to mow down anyone in his way and sacrifice anything or anybody in pursuit of their own purportedly noble goal, but in here it works differently.  The main reason way, I think, is you see the character starting not just to question his own actions, but really just becoming aware for the first time of just how far he repeatedly goes to assure the success of his quest.  There's an impending sense that as the book goes along he's going to eventually come to a realization of how brutal he truly is, but that by then it may be too late, and also a catch-22 sense that even if he does decide he wants to stop or change, the quest, once its truenature is revealed, may for once actually be too important - on a cosmic scale - to ever stop.  Roland seems to begin questioning his own methods primarily through the influence of Jake, whose complete innocence in all this seems to present almost unknown concepts to the Gunslinger.  A really, really good and unique spin on the whole philosophical question of how much 'necesary' evil is justified to stop a presumably greater evil.  It's also a really good story, a successful mixing of the western, horror, and fantasy genres, and some of the most memorably written passages King has ever done.  Highly recommended.	2004-10-27

Travis and Nora, brought together by circumstance and Einstein, are instantly likeable and empathizable as is par for the course for many Koontz protagonists, the kind of people one might willingly trade a few blood relatives in to have in the family; Einstein is entertaining and fascinating and endearing, still the lovable, playful dog despite an intelligence on par with his namesake Albert; and The Outsider is terrifying and probably the most tragic nemesis in horror literature.  A host of supporting characters, good, evil, and somewhere in the middle, fit into the story perfectly, and the author creates a highly detailed feeling of 'being there' with clear but concise descriptions of everything relevant, from architecture to the weather to the meal of the day without ever once becoming obtrusive.  Impacts on almost every level a novel can hit, one of the greatest stories ever told.	2004-10-25
US	32728453	R2QE0N9FL7FHBE	006017949X	952069519	Sacrament	Books	5	5	5	N	N	Barker's Greatest Novel?	Seamlessly blending the 'Supernatural Horror' elements that populate much of Barker's other written/filmed work [\\"The Damnation Game\\"/\\"Hellraiser\\"/etc.] with the 'Real-Life' horrors of the world today, including the envirornmental catastrophe/mass extinction currently happening on a daily basis and the AIDS epidemic, I think \\"Sacrament\\" may have trumped \\"Weaveworld\\" as Clive's best novel. It's scary as hell and yet resonating with the beauty and wonder of the world (now largely being decimated), and one of the best treatments of love and friendship in the face of a tight-knit community being eroded away by outside forces (AIDS in this case).  The vivid writing immediately transports you to the scene itself, the fierce snowstorm or long grasses blowing soundfully in the wind, and the book has an ideal protagonist in the form of a wildlife photographer who chronicles the fate of endangered and moribund species, and chillingly appropriate villains in the form of a pair who hunts down the last survivors of near-extinct species for the express purpose of personally ending their kind's existance.  Also mixing in a healthy dose of spiritualism, \\"Sacrament\\" is great on so many levels, but be forewarned: Barker outdoes himself on a couple of the grotesqueries, excluding of course \\"The Great And Secret Show\\", which got a bit too vile for my tastes.  Unlike Secret Show, however, which was far more cynical and nastier than even the most violent and bizarre of Barker's movies, the depravities and crudities of certain villains in \\"Sacrament\\" compliments the story well instead of choking it in nihilism.   <br /> <br />   An excellent piece of literature both as a great horror/fantasy hybrid and as a look at non-fictional trends in the world today (extinctions, intolerance, AIDs, etc.) that threaten to crush us all.	2004-10-17

Perhaps too mature on certain levels for many of the younger Potter fans (or perhaps moreover for their parents), \\"Balook\\" nonetheless handles its touches of sexuality with great class and taste as part of the blossoming romance between the two human leads as their time together progresses.  More likely to be too unsettling for younger redaers (though it probably won't raise as many alarm bells among many parents), is the frank, disturbing and realistic portrayal of how some humans view tormenting of and cruelty to live animals as some kind of perverse entertainment; though the novel clearfully comes down on the side of the animals and rightfully casts the tormentors in an unflattering light, it may really upset young readers.  Nonetheless, it's clearly a great introductory book to Science Fiction for, say pre-teens (and some younger readers; each kid is different) and moreover, it, like the Potter books and \\"Abarat\\" is proof that a well-written 'Basically-All-Ages' book really can be for pretty much all ages, just as delightful for 39 year-olds and 99 year-olds as for 9 year-olds and 12 year-olds. <br /> <br />   \\"Balook\\" takes place in a semi-near future, when humanity has finally begun to wake up from its globally-destructive tendencies only to realize they've driven too many of the planet's plant and animal species to extinction for natural eco-systems to be viable anymore.  In desperation, mankind has turned to genetic engineering to 're-create' lost species (this was actually the first scenario I ever read in which widescale genetic manipulation by humans Might be ethically acceptable) andstop the natural world from collapsing (and perhaps atone for the shameless destructiveness of past decades?)  However, limited surviving species to work with for core material and inherent biological limitations mean that not nearly all of the recently killed-off species can be revived, necessitating the resurrection of long-extinct species where possible, to fill ecological gaps.  One of the long-extinct species brought back is the 13 million years-gone Baluchitherium (one of whom is named Balook for short). <br /> <br />   This is the story of this recently revived creature and the young human caretakers who love them, filled with possibility, adventure, and the dangers of reviving radically different species in the midst of a human race that, despite its dawning maturement, still has more quarters apt to react with fear and hostility to anything different; and some of the gentlest and most alive romantic scenes in literature.  Topped off with beautiful black-and-white illustrations by Patrick Woodroffe (though his forte is clearly with the creatures; the human characters illustrated look less photorealistic, and consistently a couple of years younger than the texts describe them to be; still very good though). <br /> <br />   \\"Balook\\" is one of the best and most original books in Anthony's vast body of excellent work.	2004-10-02

One Of The Best Hulk Stories Ever	Reprints #s 34-39 of the current ongoing \\"Hulk\\" series, featuring the debut of Bruce Jones, and a great jumping-on point for anyone who hasn't read the series in a long time, or an ultimate treasure for longtime fans. <br /> <br />   Without giving too much away, Bruce Banner is on the run from just about everyone, with the Hulk accused of killing a child in a rampage.  The trouble is, the evidence that this ever occured is in short supply, and ulterior motives seem to abound.  The six comics reprinted here are all absolutely top-notch (and include one issue from Marvel's \\"Nuff Said\\" event, where the comics unfolded entirely without words.  I don't know about all the others, but this one worked incredibly well, and blended into the larger story seamlessly)  Flawless dialogue, stunning art (including the stunning reprinted covers from the original issues) and a somewhat different incarnation of the Hulk than we've seen before.  The thing about the Hulk is that it's been established many years ago that the Banner/Hulk split cracks in more than 2 directions (remember Joe Fixit?) so you can do stuff like this without contradicting continuity. <br /> <br />   One of the very best Trade Paperbacks on the market.  If you've never read a comic book before, or you haven't read one in decades, this book alone could hook you into the wonderful world of comicdom.	2004-10-01

I highly urge anyone who buys this to get the full \\"Hawkman Secret Files # 1\\" comic as well; I find the DC Secret Files books to be indispensable in getting the full impact of the series they cover (besides which, they're tremendous reads on their own merits).  In Hawkman's case, the full Secret Files is even more necessary than usual, due to the characters's admittedly convoluted histories.  However, everything you need to know is condensed into the files for the main characters, which is not to say you may not want to go back and read the previous stories anyway. <br /> <br />   On to the main focus: the first six issues of the current (and brilliant) ongoing \\"Hawkman\\" series are here, all of them rating a perfect 10/10 except for # 4, whose sole flaw was that it should have been longer; it's as if the creative team had to cram 2 comics worth into a single issue, although it remains stronger than it should have been if that were indeed the case.  The 2-issue Green Arrow arc (nos. 5 & 6) is one of the very best 2-issue arcs I've read in over two decades of reading comic books. <br /> <br />   Some random thoughts: Hawkman himself, while never straying from being a noble defender of the innocent and persecuted, is truly the most savage hero the DC Universe has ever seen.  The creative team, led by co-writers Geoff Johns & James Robinson and penciller Rags Morales, are so good they can make even a character like the Gentleman Ghost seem not only intriguing but downright intimidating; meanwhile the new incarnation of Copperhead could carry a whole horror movie (or franchise) on his own.  Ace colorist John Kalisz is turning in the work of his career here.  The use of locales lesser seen in the DC Universe (Louisiana; India; etc.) pays off in spades.  Series develops a great supporting cast right from the get-go - that's a must, no series Ever succeeds on title character alone.  And of course, the strange relationship between Hawkman and Hawkgirl.... <br /> <br />   Highest possible recommendation.	2004-10-01
US	32728453	RVAXD5A5PST2X	0399137815	116925243	Killobyte	Books	5	9	11	N	N	Grand Fantasy Adventure With A Heart And Soul	\\"Killobyte\\" wouldn't have to be anything more than what it's described as on the back - a near-future hyper-realistic virtual reality game where players can play almost any role, until a hacker brings into the game the possibility of real death to the players - and succeed marvelously as an exhilirating adventure story and prime fodder for any number of dreams and fantasies.  But, being written by Piers Anthony, it also adds in some extra dimensions for even more reward. <br /> <br />   First, the VR-adventure themes - players play 'online' with and against any number of other players (and bear in mind that this was written in 1993, when things like the Internet were still in their infancy), choosing from a vast array of scenarios - High Fantasy type with dragons and sorcerors and dashing knights and beautiful maidens; Science Fictional settings; 'real-life' political intrigue/military settings - just about anything you can think of - and select from a host of loosely-defined 'roles' within their scenario, then go on to custom-make the specific attributes of their character.  Players can log in and out of their scenario and come back in inprogress, but if killed ingame must start a new character.  For any fan of video games, adventure/fantasy movies, and the sexier possibilities in Virtual Reality role-playing, this guarantees a great novel provided it's written well, which this is. <br /> <br />   But there's more - first of all, though it's evident that the majority of Killobyte-players are 'normal', reasonably well-adjusted people whose excursions into the VR world no more mean that they can't enjoy the real world, any more than people who watch a lot of movies or read a lot of books can't enjoy numerous other aspects of life; the two lead characters - Waler and Baal - are indeed hampered by limitations that severely hamper their ability to partake of the 'real' world.  And their backstories are given, providing insight into and generating real empathy for thecharacters.  Baal, for example (this isn't giving anything away, it comes up early in the book) is both severely diabetic and hypershy.  This is one thing I love about Anthony's writing: like Stephen King and Dean Koontz he includes characters with physical and/or mental ailments as main parts of the cast - sometimes it's not a main point, just a 'just-happens-to-be' kind of thing; other times it's a significant part of the character.  But even when it's significant in the character and the story, it's always made clear that the affliction (or disability or whatever you want to call it) is FAR from the sole characteristic that makes up the person.  This is true of Koontz's and King's books as well. <br /> <br />   Piers also frequently includes characters of different races, belief systems, ethnicities, and the other things that unfortunately tend to divide people, into his books.  Here, for example, the Druze religion is briefly brought into things, an actual religion that I had never heard of before reading \\"Killobyte\\".  As a species, humanity isn't doing as good a job as it could of the different peoples mingling and understanding and respecting one another in the real world.  Perhaps greater exposure to different cultures, religions, etc., through things like books and movies is a place to start?  (If you agree with that, I'd enthusiastically urge you to check out \\"The Veiled Web\\" by Catherine Asaro, an excellent book that has the very notions above as one of its two main themes, along with the emergence of genuine Artificial Intelligence) <br /> <br />    There's one other thing about this that's a big drawing point - the Author Notes at the back. Years back I gave up reading most Author Notes and interviews and the like, and I Never watch the behind-the-scenes making-of features on DVDs, because I don't want to risk spoiling the magic of the story.  At the time I ceased with the interviews and stuff, I decided there were a few sources who were 'safe' in this way, Anthony being one of them.  His notes are always entertaining, enlightening, and never take away even a smidgen of the magic of his books	2004-10-01

It's also one of the scariest, with the Rawhead 'N Bloody Bones bog monster more frightening than most of the nasties conceived of by Stephen King or H.P. Lovecraft.  As far as comedic value goes, I rank it with \\"Fawlty Towers\\", \\"Fierce Creatures\\", and \\"A Fish Called Wanda\\", and the \\"Gon\\" comics.  On mix of triumph and tragedy, fear and delight and whimsey, think \\"E.T.\\", \\"Bambi\\", and even \\"Simon Birch\\". <br />     <br />    With a superb cast of characters - on par with the cast of the \\"Batman\\" or \\"X-Men\\" lines of comics, and unique, quirky art so expressive, especially in certain panels, that it sums up the expression 'A Picture Is Worth A Thousand Words' perhaps better than anything I've ever encountered.

Ivy has never been really evil like The Joker or Mr. Zsasz, not even close, but she was at one point a villain, albeit a sympathetic one.  This is one of the comics that captures her right at the period of her evolution when she was changing into something more - not a superhero: she'll never be part of The Justice League or anything, nor would she have any interest in it - but she can't be classed as just one of the 'bad guys' anymore.  This book shows her passion for her causes and her compassion - for the plant kingdom, for her plant-animal hybrids, even for humanity, as we see in the first few pages with the interaction between Ivy and the young Nicarauguan girl. <br /> <br />     Although, ironically, as she becomes less of a villain and more of a crusader herself, this puts her more and more into conflict with human society than she ever was as a 'costumed criminal' robbing Gotham's wealthy elite.  She despises the corporate 'slash-and-burn' mentality and the world governments that condone it.  She is particularly protective of plants, who seems to feel are sentient and communicate with her.  Now, does this make her crazy?  Or is she right, or is the truth somewhere in between?  I don't think DC's ever definitively said, and hopefully it never will.  Some questions are better left to interpretation and ponderings.  But one certainly knows where she's coming from. <br /> <br />    For double irony, as she's becoming less of a villain but more into conflict with human society as a whole, she's also becoming more of a benefactor of and champion of humanity itself.  There's the aforementioned scene with the Nicarauguan girl (which I won't elaborate on to avoid any spoilers); see also her role in the year-long \\"Batman: No Man's Land\\" saga - most of which is available in the trade paperbacks here on Amazon, I believe - and her related appearances in \\"Detective Comics\\" #s 751 and 752, just for starters. <br /> <br />   I don't mean to ignore Batman, who's depicted great in here, as he generally is, but Batman gets a chance to shine in hundreds and hundreds of issues of various titles; it's okay that here he's not even a co-star but a supporting player to Ivy.  This is Ivy's spotlight all the way through, and is the story of the actions she takes after the violence-free tropical utopia she's created from dust is annihilated by some of the poorer examples of the human race.	2004-09-27

These aliens are Truly Alien; among the more familiar-seeming are glowing 'Turtles' that now swim through the seas of Ganymede; Venus, in addition to being home to human cities now that it has a cooler surface and oxygen atmosphere, also has Bgarth, super-giant cyborg wormlike beings who terraformed the world and whose nerve cells interact directly with the 'reaction site' that produces Venus's new air - one character early on goes so far as to say that \\"in one sense, you can think of the current atmosphere of Venus as a Bgarth thought\\" (talk about exotic concepts in sci-fi!).  Other species, in both physiology and culture are as alien or in some cases even more so, and most seem to have large cults of human acolytes, even worshippers. <br /> <br />    Human society too is dynamically different; it's not just the Earth of today with awesome new technologies added in, and we see not only a picture of human culture at the time \\"Deepdrive\\" actually takes place, but we get glimpses of the changes it underwent through the previous centuries, including prior to first contact with the first extraterrestrials to enter the system.  In fact, we get tantalizing Glimpses of so much - different aspects of what's going on on Earth; the situation on Mercury with its own alien colonizers; SO much, that this can't be the only book written in this continuity.  It would be a great deprivation of literature if the author didn't carry on with at least a couple more books to explore some of what's been only hinted at.  In fact, I'd go so far as to say that I'd like to see this become a whole universe of novels, in the sense of how \\"Star Wars\\" and \\"Star Trek\\" and even Isaac Asimov's \\"Foundation\\" books are being done following their creator's passing on: different authors contributing different novels in different locales, different time periods, different species getting the spotlight, even totally different characters; the concept is so vast it could easily be done.  I would love to see an entire novel taking place at the time of the legendary first contact.  If more authors were to contribute to this full line (though Jablokov is obviously the first choice to write as many of the pivotal novels as possible)I would nominate Piers Anthony and Kathy Tyers, for starters.  There is so much left unsaid and undiscovered, there is no limit as to how one could expand on this first entry.  And the book has truly Shock ending that absolutely demands a direct sequel with the same characters. <br /> <br />    As for the characters themselves, many of them seem at first to be not especially likable.  But as you go further and deeper, they seem to have more redeeming characteristics than one might have expected, buried almost deliberately under ruthless exteriors.  Human society has Not, despite the changes it's seen in the centuries, become a less brutal thing, and the surrounding universe, while now clearly full of all the wonder and more that pre-contact humans have dreamt it might have, is jarringly full of menace as well, and it's as if the people in this time era, even more so than today, have had to build up very hard exteriors just to emotionally survive.  This is also true of certain alien characters the reader meets, although we don't get to know very many of them on a personal level (another reason why more books in this continuity are a necessity).  Science Fiction novels don't tend to focus on 'destiny' as much as, say, Fantasy novels, but it's almost as if the Solar System (and perhaps more) is at some kind of metaphorical critical mass, <br />and fate is drawing together individuals (of different species) of usually checkered backgrounds but with the potential for nobility, for some grand purpose.  Some Science Fiction readers may not like such a notion, finding it to be 'unscientific', but there should be more than enough 'Hard-SF' to make up for such departures even to the most dognatic of its fans.  Besides, \\"Deepdrive\\" isn't solely a Science Fiction novel, it's adventure, in places it's freezing horror, it's speculative philosophy at its best, and it's one of The best novels ever written, genre or no genre.	2004-09-26
