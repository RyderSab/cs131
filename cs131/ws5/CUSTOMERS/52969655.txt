Aside from the fact that it was different because of the hero's seizure I did not find him dangerous, witty, or special And she was just so WIMPY and I was so sick and tired of Quaker this and Quaker that.I was frustrated at how being a Quaker (in those days, I'm sure) put so many limitations on her actions and her feelings.  And the details were so intricate I was skimming over pages. Not sure I'll be reading Kinsale again!	2003-07-01

But I would have given it 5 stars had the author made the love scenes more romantic and detailed.  Lucky is a wonderful hero and the heroine wasn't physically perfect which many other authors tend to do.

Her husband, Norman drove me nuts with his to-do lists, the special treatment of the dog, and how he hated his meal schedule interrupted.  I was appalled with his saying that she only had half a brain! How she ever managed to stay with him for twelve years is beyond me.

She didn't know Benedict but a few hours when she had agreed to do the charade.  (Regardless of the drink that Sedgewick gave her). Her grandfather was witty and blunt - I enjoyed his character.  I didn't care much for Camilla's aunts or cousins. It had it's moments but I was not as happy with this book as I am with her recent books.	2000-10-10

Jonathan Stafford is that sexy forbidden man who has power and intends to use it to keep his family safe, especially his son Alex.  Here comes Devon James, who decides to write a book based on what she encounters in a bed and breakfast in CT, who Jonathan happens to own. Of course no one is really taking Devon seriously but she did feel and see things in that yellow room and she sets out to find out what it is. Even if it means digging into the Stafford family history. Kat Martin has spun a different kind of tale and she has not let me down.  I was in suspense through the whole book, biting my nails - afraid of what would happen next!	2000-10-04

Elizabeth with her &quot;How to Marry a Marquis&quot; book and James with his so-called help to find her a husband.  It was hilarious when he said that Captain Andrien stoops and she could not possibly marry a man who stoops &amp; at the end of the chapter she tells him, &quot;Oh James? Stand up straight&quot; - His boxing instructions were entertaining as well.   Her siblings were also very fun. I hope to read about them in the future.  Especially little Lucas.  <br />Lady Danbury was in a category of her own - she was great!  Not to mention that cat!  I especially &quot;loved&quot; Quinn's ending - sensational!	2000-09-30

If I'm still asking myself  this question after reading 400 pgs Henley has not made me happy!  Brianna  was unappreciative of all Christian was offering her and I did not feel  that she truly loved him. In most books love conquers all and if she was  willing to marry Robert because of her guilt - then she didn't really love  Christian. And what kind of hero still has his one night stand shagged up  in the same house where he and his wife are going to live?  Joan had no  self-esteem, her whole life revolved around Edward and his wishes. Edward  disappointed me greatly when he married Joan off to Holland and then way  later wanted to make amends?	2000-09-18
