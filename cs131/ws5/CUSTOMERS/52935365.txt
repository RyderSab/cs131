A shameless work that trivializes this great man and his complex times by interpreting 19th-century social behavior through the shallow and self-indulgent lens of modern homosexuality. Despite its scholarly aura and the credentialled background of its author, this book is an appallingly biased interpretation that culls selectively from the sparse historical record to support a pet theory, while ignoring historical documentation that points in the direction of Lincoln's being a man of ordinary heterosexual interest (e.g., infatuations with women, possible interludes with prostitutes, etc.). The book is astonishingly devoid of insight or appreciation for the fact that Lincoln's times had a social culture of of their own, one that cannot be understood through the conventions of modern social and emotional relationships. For example, the author sees great significance in Lincoln's famously troubled marriage and his social awkwardness with women, as well as the emotional intensity of his correspondence with friend Joshua Speed and the fact that Lincoln shared a bed with Speed and other men at various periods of his life. The author reads into this material an argument for homosexuality, effectively ignoring the social conventions and economic realities of the era which, for example, routinely placed reasonably companionable persons of the same sex into a shared bed. The truth of the matter is that the historical record is basically nonextistent in the matter of Lincoln's sexuality per se, in keeping with the documentation of the times which did not see fit to investigate or speculate upon a statesman's sexual life in the absence of events that would suggest anything out of the ordinary.  <br /> <br />The author is granted heightened credibility by virtue of his being a sex researcher and a psychotherapist. I too am a psychotherapist, and as such it is patently clear to me that this book is really just a wishful fantasy on the part of the author that reveals more about his own sexual predilections than those of Lincoln. The book is an excellent example of the truism that the human mind can find \\"evidence\\" for any idea if one looks hard enough for it ... while conveniently ignoring evidence to the contrary.	2005-02-13

With lucid, straightforward writing it manages to convey the particular qualities and character that uniquely attended each connection. It doesn't add more to the subject than the historical record suggests, but it does pull together what iis known of each relationship and present the material with thematic consistency and honesty. Seeks to inform rather than to advocate an author's pet bias or theory--e.g., avoids the self-indulgent nonsense of some Lincoln writers that interprets historical norms through the distortion of a modern social lens, for example interpreting his friendships as latently homosexual ... a theory which may gratify the emotional need of the author but for which no true historical evidence exists.

I am a novice gardener who is trying to figure out how to maintain a well-landscaped property that I inherited. After the first couple of years of letting the place &quot;rest on its laurels&quot; (i.e., get by on its past grandeur and do nothing to maintain it except to water it every now and then, but otherwise neglecting it and letting it get weedy and rangy), I have finally tackled the project of educating myself about gardening and trying to restore some freshness and style to my garden. This book offers a very skillful overview of everything I need to know in order to take on this project. It gives an overview of pretty much every fundamental of gardening, giving enough explanation to help you understand the logic behind the &quot;rules&quot; of garden creation and maintenance, but without the kind of technical detail that would make it tedious or would glaze the eye of the beginner. I have found this an excellent &quot;starter&quot; book--gives the lay of the land, as it were, so that you can establish basic competence and understanding before you go onto more specialized knowledge.

Born into abject poverty in conditions where she was neither wanted nor nurtured, Bow led a scrappy survival-driven existence which was entirely free of artifice or pretension or social grace. This unthinking and natural vitality was at once her greatest gift (as a screen personality) and her ultimate curse, as it enabled the naive actress to be repeatedly exploited and betrayed by everyone from her career managers to her lovers to her friends. Her tragic life is told in a style that keeps you engaged and conveys the pathos of this really likeable person's life.	2004-06-04

I came away it with the impression that Valentino was a passionate if somewhat impractical and hapless man who was often misunderstood and ungenerously treated by the American media of his day. Unfortunately, there is not a lot that is known about the man which would illuminate his personality in a direct way, so much of the sense you get of him is rather indirectly and implicitly conveyed. I really appreciated that the author did not fall into the common trap of presenting a personal theory or fantasy of Valentino as though it were established fact, choosing instead to maintain a reasonable and even-handed approach that springs from the facts rather than from her own need to see Valentino in a particular way. For example, regarding the widely circulated notions that Valentino was \\"really\\" homosexual: Rudy here comes off as a distinctly heterosexual man whose Italian style of sensuousness led some Americans to interpret him as effeminate or to imagine him as homosexual. This author's depiction seems to be the most reasonable and likely given the complete absence of any actual historical data that points toward homosexuality.	2004-05-28

This book was originally published in 1865 (the centennial of the assassination) and is probably the prototype for serious overviews of this topic.

The photographs in this book are lovely -- a great array of 19th-century children's portraits which reflect a variety of moods and attitudes. The drawback of the book is that it lacks any information on the photographs which might place them in a particular year or might comment on the children's outfits!! In other words, it's left wholly up to the viewer (not reader) to interpret the pictures! Thus while the book is truly nice for its collection of photographs, it's quite useless for someone who wants to feed his/her mind with a bit of information.	2002-04-19

Unfortunately, the execution (no pun intended) of this idea fell a bit short for me. While the  writing is engaging and humorous, I found myself wishing that the book were  more inclusive in its breadth and depth. For example, I think a book about  this letter-writing project would be ten times more intriguing if it  reproduced all the letters written on both sides, complete and unabridged,  rather than just including the occasional excerpt here and there. This  level of disclosure seems reasonable at least in the case of killers who  have since died (e.g., Gacy). To show the full correspondence would allow  readers to draw their own conclusions about the killer's mind as well as  about the dynamic evolving between the correspondents.  Second, I think the  book would be greatly improved by focusing on just one serial killer, Gacy,  since that is apparently the only relationship that was ever really  developed, and the author's correspondence with the other the other killers  is so brief and incomplete as to be a distraction rather than an  enhancement to the main interest. I also would have enjoyed a deeper,  subtler, and more complex (hence more haunting) analysis by the author as  to how his contact with the killers (Gacy in particular) came to work  itself on his own psyche--and how it brought the author into contact with  his own dark side. The author conveys his own presence in mostly light,  glib, and humorous tones, repeatedly implying that he himself is  &quot;normal&quot; and thus capable of empathizing with the killers only up  to a point. Surely an author with this particular fascination, and with  Moss' obvious intelligence and imagination for getting a feel for unusual  personalities, must have a fair amount of psychological meanness in his own  shadow in order to recognize it in others. For example, it was clear to me  throughout--though never seriously considered by the author--that the  author shared with his killer pals the following personality  characteristics: a gift for and a delight in deception, manipulation, and  mental game-playing; the propensity to regard others (his correspondents)  as objects to be toyed with for his own amusement; a love of control, of  maintaining a one-up, omniscient/omnipotent, and predatory position  vis-a-vis the other; and the arrogance of thinking he can pull off the  &quot;perfect crime.&quot; I give the book 4 stars because it's a great  concept and the writing is capable and entertaining as far as it goes. But  I can't give it 5 stars because an altogether deeper and more serious  account of the project would have taken it so much farther!  Maybe when the  author is older he can rethink the material and come up with a more  substantial version of this experience which is very unusual and worth  telling.  ugh never seriously considered by the author--that the  author shared with his killer pals the following personality  characteristics: a gift for and a delight in deception, manipulation, and  mental game-playing; the propensity to regard others (his correspondents)  as objects to be toyed with for his own amusement; a love of control, of  maintaining a one-up, omniscient/omnipotent, and predatory position  vis-a-vis the other; and the arrogance of thinking he can pull off the  &quot;perfect crime.&quot; I give the book 4 stars because it's a great  concept and the writing is capable and entertaining as far as it goes.

I have read a lot of true crime, and I found this to be one of the duller, more forgettable offerings. First of all, the subject Harvey Glatman is not terribly interesting either as a personality or as a murderer. Second, the  book was overly long for the volume of information contained; the second  1/3 - 1/2 is pretty much a rehash of the first part, with no new  information coming forth. Best about the book: Glatman, as a true-crime  genre subject, is a bit refreshing and even oddly likable insofar as he's  not into sadism, and such murders as he committed were (to him) an  unpleasant necessity for avoiding punishment in his misguided search for  pretty much straight sex.	2000-06-04

The main premise is unusual enough to keep you involved, though for a sociopathic team neither their m.o. nor their individual  personalities are especially interesting. Gerald is a low-class career  criminal and comes off as pretty unimaginative, obviously coarse, and  basically a lug-head; I got no sense of the supposedly irresistable  charisma that the author attributes to him, and because I saw no redeeming  feature he lacked the dimension to make him really interesting. Charlene  supposedly comes from a cultured background and has a genius-level I.Q.,  yet you're hard-pressed to find it given her trashy language and her  complete lack of insight or even ambivalence regarding Gerald and their  twisted mission. There is no persuasive accounting, either directly or  indirectly, for their peculiar attraction.<br />Thus at the level of  character/ psychological depiction the writing seems weak, and the same  lack of texture and imagination also characterizes the narrative structure.  The book pretty much describes things in straight chronological order, and  there's little in the way of surprises or accumulating  tension/horror/insight. <br />If you're interested in reading about a mad  marriage, I recommend the books about Paul Bernardo and Karla Homolka  (e.g., Deadly Innocence, Invisible Darkness). Not only are these books  vastly better written, but the players are more complex and interesting as  well.	2000-05-18

The book builds gradually and skillfully to depict Paul Bernardo as  a superficially charming but a secretly  self-centered,  manipulative/calculating, sadistic,  sex-obsessed monster of unimaginable  proportions who is driven by a psychotically grandiose sense of his own  importance and power, to entangle his mostly reluctant partner--Karla  Homolka, his main sex slave who is terrorized by Paul's increasingly brutal  psychological and physical torture--into his single-minded mission of  acting out his horrific and perverted fantasies of dominating and violating  young women. <br />The book is very well crafted, steadily revealing a stream  of appalling information that makes this couple look disturbed and  disturbing enough from the perspective of outsiders ... only to have the  reader's understanding of the couple turn into something a hundred times  more nightmarish when seen from the inside perspective of Karla herself!  The book is long--over 500 pages of small print--yet it kept me constantly  absorbed and turning the pages into the wee hours of the night.

I'd say the book is one of those mass market sensationialistic types, adequately written insofar as it's easy to read, keeps your interest, and moves along quickly. But, in  keeping with this genre, it unfortunately lacks depth. It pretty much  reports the facts, without delving significantly into the characters'  psyches or motivations. In fact, by the end of the book I had very little  sense of who Teena Brandon was; the apparent contradictions in her  character of being sensitive and caring to lovers vs. being self-serving,  irresponsible, and unethical to everyone else (including society) went  unexplained and unilluminated. I would have liked to understand her more,  since the real point of this book is not so much the crime of her death  (which is not very complicated and is swiftly accounted for) but rather the  strangeness of her life.	2000-04-02

In addition to its practicality, this book is very beautifully written--compassionate without  being trite or lightweight.	2000-02-09

First, the illustrations are varied, numerous, and very interesting--and they are printed on high-quality glossy paper which is pleasant to the eyes and the  hands. Second, the information is thorough without being repetitive. Third,  the writing is professional and eloquent yet extremely easy and quick to  read, very unencumbered by a verbose or dry style. This is a very good  all-around book about the Titanic--thorough, entertaining, bittersweet.	1999-12-20

I gave this book three stars because on the one hand I hated it yet on the other hand I couldn't stop reading it. On the bad side was author  himself (Gaskins), how horrifying and depraved his attitudes and actions; on the  good side it was very engrossing and the autobiography style was really  effective at conveying the killer's perceptions and personality. It's hard  to believe that such pure evil exists in any person; Gaskins is like a man  who is completely deficient and devoid in the area of empathy and  compassion. The man is truly abnormal, yet terrifyingly capable of a  superficially &quot;normal&quot; presentation. A good example of the  psychopath (NOT the psychotic) in his terrifying blankness of humanity.	1999-12-12

In one of them the light bulb burnt out or broke within the first week, and in the other the light intensity kept flickering from bright to very dim; in both  cases the light bobbed and shook far too much for a relaxed and effortless  reading experience. What with one or another of these very annoying  distractions, I've never managed to make my way through even one chapter  using this method. A cute design and a lovely idea, but a poor product.	1999-12-09

The book  itself is very easy to understand--simple-minded, even, in its handling of  the material--yet it leaves no lasting impact on me. Far more vivid for me,  as far as getting a sense of how Cameron looks at things and what  &quot;Titanic&quot; meant for him, was &quot;James Cameron's Titanic.&quot;  That's the book to read if you want to get a feel for Cameron's emotional  and working relationship to the movie.	1999-12-07
US	52935365	R1OXHKA7FIGBHW	0786703954	241257992	Bookworms: Great Writers and Readers Celebrate Reading	Books	2	5	6	N	N	Disappointing and forgettable	As a self-confessed bibliophile, I hoped the contributions to this book would evoke and reflect the peculiar state of mind that booklovers get during the reading experience--something on the order of Tom Raabe's  &quot;Biblioholism,&quot; or &quot;Reading in Bed.&quot; However, I found  this book to be quite a disappointment. The entries are, as a group,  unremarkable and fail to engage the emotions (at least for me). Just a very  few of the passages were interesting or evocative enough to flag for future  reflection. I did not keep this book, unlike others on the subject of  bibliomania.	1999-11-27

This is a warm, gentle, sweet-hearted devotional to the great writer by her husband, who clearly was (is) genuinely in love with this wife of 40  years. Bayley's writing is literate and engaging, and it well conveys the  spirit of both Murdoch's writing and her imagination. It is interesting to  get a sense of Iris the person (apparently as original and oddly  ungraspable as the characters and narratives of her novels), and it would  have been nice to get more information about her along these lines. The  marriage depicted has a flavor that is tweedy, intellectual, quaintly  innocent, and gently eccentric in a veddy British way. The only weaknesses  for me were the author's occasional extended digressions about his own  views on literature, and the resulting sense of wanting a more intensive  and penetrating focus on Iris Murdoch herself. Overall, the book is a cozy,  enjoyable, undemanding little read that really engages your heart and your  imagination.	1999-10-29

It debunks some of the most common truisms of financial management, and it does so by providing very good explanations that really teach you the  concepts, and by teaching you what to do instead. The writing is  non-technical but very, very intelligent and enjoyable to read. I first got  this book from the library, and I found its wisdom so valuable and so  original that I then BOUGHT a copy--something I have NEVER done with other  investment/ financial planning books. Get this book and it will change the  way you think about protecting your money!	1999-06-01

I am a marriage therapist and find this book to be  refreshingly intellegent, atheoretical, nonmoralistic and unbiased analysis  of what takes place when estrangement creeps into and overtakes a once-  viable connection between lovers. It is a solid, unprejudiced depiction of  the process from both partners' points of views, without being tritely  subjective. It is very readable, but certainly not simple-minded in its  content. Strongly recommended.	1999-03-24

I am an avid reader of material related to the Lincoln assassination, and I approached this book expecting it to be interesting if for no other reason than its relevance to  that historical event. However, I found the book to be exceptionally boring  and slow in its beginning, so much so that after about a fourth of the book  I put it down expecting not to finish it (very unusual for me). The  characters were dimensionless, stereotypical, and uninteresting, and at  many points the characters' psychology and the central sexual/romantic  liaison struck me as irritatingly inauthentic for the period depicted.  However, I did return to the book--skipping right to the assassination  scene itself since the first part was so damned boring. From this point  forward, the action got really engrossing and suspenseful, and the book  became one that I couldn't put down. The action was very well paced, though  the main characters' personalities and their relationship to each other  still seemed inauthentic--or at least the book left me wondering how much  of these depictions were rooted in fact and how much they were pure  fiction. It would be nice for the author to clarify which elements or  dimensions of the story are historically known and which are his own  invention. In the end, it was a book that was very memorable, one that  really impacted me insofar as it has changed my notions of this who this  couple was. But again, I wish I knew whether my new understanding of their  personalities and their relationship--and of the assassination's apparently  lasting dominance over their lives--derives from an accurate or a purely  imaginative portrayal of the characters.	1999-03-24

A very funny, delicious reading experience for those of us who overindulge our passion for books! The author walks a fine line between satire and genuine all-too-familiar excesses . A really amusing grasp of the psychology of book addicts. I adored this book, and my only frustration was that the book ended so soon!	1998-05-22

Over and over I got the feeling that the author was teasing the reader with implicit promises of more to come, only to tread a maddeningly non-committal road throughout. For someone with such intimate access to the principal players in this drama, he seems to withhold a great deal of his own observation or opinion that would be truly interesting. You get the feeling that he's trying not to alienate anyone on OJ's team so that he won't burn his professional/personal bridge to them. An unfortunate cop-out.	1997-11-29
