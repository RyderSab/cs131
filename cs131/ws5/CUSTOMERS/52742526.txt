This we read about in &quot;The Guns of Normandy&quot; by Blackburn (which I reviewed).<br />Even though in this book we move to new battlefields, I wondered what more George Blackburn could have to say about his war. Plenty, I discovered. He was a young newspaper reporter when he enlisted in the Canadian Army in 1939.  He never stopped thinking like a reporter, always somehow managed to take notes, and preserve them.  We are fortunate he lived through his battlefield experiences, are more fortunate still that he wrote of them with such brilliant detail.  He reveals over and over a truly human mixture of compassion - Gunner Hardtack was a hen that miraculously survived the destruction of a farm to be adopted by B Troop as a mascot --  and detachment - what can you do for the thousands of dead all around you, all the time?<br />Captain Blackburn, commander of Able Troop, 2nd Battery, 4th Field Battalion, spends much of his combat time as a Forward Observation Officer, or FOO. So they can to accurately call down fire from a 4-gun troop, a 24-gun regiment, the 72 guns of the division, or even the 216 guns of 2nd Canadian Corps, FOOs lived at the front. When the action is the hottest, FOOs must be at the front of the front to order artillery fire precisely where it is needed. A FOO is often observing from a place where he can be spotted, or deduced to be there through common sense by those being shelled. The Canadians lost a lot of FOOs.<br />An incident in the book: Blackburn is FOOing from a towering windmill in Groesbeek, The Netherlands.  It is a commodious structure, high and offering a broad view of the front from the fan window. Footsteps on the stairs, and a Canadian general appears. Blackburn diplomatically keeps shooing him back from the fan window to keep him from being visible to some German peering through binocs. Another general joins them.  The two comment on such a fine observation post, an OP without peer in Groesbeek, and wonder why Fritz has left it alone.  Blackburn offers the opinion that the Germans must believe that no one in his right mind would dare occupy such an obvious OP.  Ahem, yes, and the generals depart.<br />&quot;The Guns of Victory&quot; takes up where &quot;The Guns of Normandy&quot; left off, and we're in furious combat most of the time. That courageous and enterprising Commander of D-Company, Major Bob Suckling, repeatedly earns our admiration: In one of many of his hair-raising escapades his infantry company is under a furious counter attack, and via field phone he's calling down fire dangerously close to his own position.  &quot;Can you bring your shells a bit closer?&quot; he asks the battery commander. Another heavy barrage of 120 rounds of 25-pounders and Suckling reports, &quot;You're right on.&quot; Then there is silence from his end, a long and ominous silence. Did we shell Suckling? the fire controller wonders. Further calls fail to draw any response until Suckling's drawl comes over the line to report, &quot;The Heinies seem to have pulled back.&quot;  The Gunners would learn later that a German had poked his head in the door of Suckling's OP house.  After taking time out to pistol the enemy soldier Suckling came back on the air.  So many of the soldiers and officers I had come to like got killed along the way. I worried that every next page might report that Suckling &quot;got it&quot; until the end of the book.  Thank goodness there was no such report.<br />This is a splendid narrative, one that would make a fine novelist proud.<br />The book has some good photos, a fine index.  Footnotes appear on the relevant pages, not as endnotes that require endless flipping back and forth.	2002-01-08

Some of the bloodiest fighting in WWII	This is the story of barely two months of the eleven months of brutal combat seen by Canada's 4th Field artillery regiment, and of the infantry units 4th Field supported with astonishing firepower. After several years in England, 4th Field's combat role begins with the regiment's landing in Normandy twenty days after D-Day.<br />Canadian field artillery during WWII was the best in the world. The guns of every artillery unit in a given battlefield sector were laid out on a grid plan that allowed Forward Observation Officers to call in pinpoint fire from every other regiment as well as their own. The Germans, who considered their's the best, were astounded by the Canadians' ability to rain huge barrages down precisely on target. Post-war German accounts of the fighting here repeatedly mention the dreaded Canadian field artillery. When Canadian infantry companies were being overrun, they often took what cover they could find and called in artillery barrages on their own positions, catching the Germans out in the open and astounded that they would do it.<br />In some of the fiercest action of WWII the Canadian Army advanced only 30-some miles, but they slugged it out against some of Germany's toughest, most fanatical panzer divisions and battle-hardened infantry. Hitler had ordered them not to give up an inch of ground, and they tried desperately to obey. Nevertheless, the Canadian units drove them into the famous Falaise Pocket from which only remnants of crack German divisions escaped.<br />One reason why writings by men on these front lines is rare is that few lived to tell about it.   Some of the Canadian outfits in this action suffered over 100% casualties. Some replacements who arrived at Blackburn's regiment one evening were wiped out the same night. It takes a man who was there to REALLY know what it's like to live in the same sopping-wet clothes, in mud-and-water-filled dugouts for weeks and weeks, rarely getting a warm meal, fighting today for ground they mayhave to give up tomorrow.<br />So much detail seeps from one's memory, and for those who try to keep notes, doing so is daunting in conditions where imagination is needed to even keep written target coordinates preserved long enough for them to be used by the gun crews. George Blackburn was a reporter before enlisting in the Canadian Army in 1939.  He took notes during combat and somehow preserved them. And, he survived the war to use them. After the war he interviewed some of the men he writes about. He visited the battlefield almost thirty years later gathering more material. His life after the war included writing in several professional regimes. His skill at painting vivid recollections of minute-to-minute life on the battlefield is evident throughout this splendid work.<br />I like the author's way of arranging the book into short chapters, each of which is an episode in the whole campaign. I like his way of presenting his first-person narrative, using &quot;you&quot; for &quot;I&quot;. It works very well: &quot;For a moment your attention is drawn to an opening in the stone wall, where a giant German tank, which you believe is a Panther, points its long-barrelled gun right at you.&quot;<br />This book, and its companion &quot;The Guns of Victory,&quot; (even better, if that's possible) are the best accounts of battlefield action I've read. Even that exemplary novelist and war historian Len Deighton, with his outstanding &quot;Fighter&quot; historical novel and &quot;Bomber&quot; true account (or was it the other way around?) doesn't measure up to this. Blackburn stands above Remarque (&quot;All's Quiet on the Western Front&quot;) and Siegfried Knappe (&quot;Soldat: Reflections of a German Soldier&quot;)<br />Detail -- vivid, essential detail - provides a crucial underpinning of the gripping narrative. 4th Field's training in England allowed us to appreciate its excellence on the battlefield. I was honored to meet some of the men, like that gallant and resourceful Capt. Bill Waddell, for just one. From the descriptions of the bombings of Canadian forces by American and RAF bombers I have gained a new understanding of how devastating saturation bombing really is. Geez! For men who are already at the ragged edge of human endurance to suffer bombing by friendly air forces ...<br />We think of war as being conducted by infantry and tanks and planes - and of course generals in their comfy commands back there. There are many more. I was pleased to learn about the vast support network behind the troops in the thick of it. The Canadians fired more rounds per gun per day in this campaign than has ever been fired before - more rounds overall than during the Normandy beachhead. How does the ammo - MOUNTAINS of ammo -- the fuel, the food, the medical help get to the front? How do they even know where the front is from one day to the next? (Some didn't, like that intrepid motorcycle messenger.) And, of course, who carries the casualties from the front, and the replacements for them? (The dead usually had to be left where they fell:  the overpowering stench of thousands of dead Canadians and Germans is always there.) <br />Footnotes, not so many as to inundate us, appear on the page, not as endnotes which keep readers flipping back and forth. The book has a fine index.	2002-01-07

And so his autobiography reeks with the conviction of a man who is certain in his own mind that his actions were honorable.<br />Robert Hanssen -- who would one day become an FBI agent -- was strongly influenced by Philby's book, and perhaps something else. He once said in a note to his Russian handlers, &quot;I decided on this course when I was 14 years old. I'd read Philby's book.&quot; The two sentences may convey an ambiguous meaning Hanssen did not intend. At any rate, he read Philby's book at some time, but not before he was twenty-four.<br />Philby's strong convictions were transmitted to Hanssen by some influence that even Philby would probably not understand. How that influence stayed with Hanssen until he was 35 is even harder to grasp, for he detested communism. But he never wavered from &quot;the course&quot; he had decided on. It seems impossible that Hanssen's motivation was ideological, but rather a quest for the exciting and romantic life of the spy, as depicted by Philby. Hanssen must have found something attractive about spying besides the money, for he kept at it for fifteen years and continued even when he knew he was under suspicion.<br />I found it easy to look at Philby with as much understanding as Archie Bunker might -- a dirty rotten pinko commie. In Russia, however, Philby is a genuine hero. And somehow that's how I feel about Russians opposed to communism who spy for the U.S.	2001-08-23

Other noted writers have expressed the same view, one that could be applied to all of literature.<br />Some readers don't like details. It is said over and over in reviews on the Amazon.com site. Given the chance, readers who loathe details would deny the pleasure to those of us who relish them. &quot;The Professor and the Madman&quot; is full of wonderful details. They make the story of the Oxford English Dictionary as compelling a tale as any mystery story.<br />Its first snappy title was: &quot;A New English Dictionary on Historical Principles, Founded Mainly on the Materials Collected by The Philogical Society, edited by James A. H. Murray, LL.D, Sometime President of the Philogical Society, with the Assistance of Many Scholars and Men of Science.&quot;<br />(Don't ask me why &quot;The Philogical Society&quot; becomes &quot;the Philogical Society&quot; in the second use. An old head once noted that if there is only one error in a book it will be in the title or on the first page.)<br />The first &quot;fascile&quot; (which my dictionary does not define), the first section was published in 1884. It presented the words from &quot;a&quot; to &quot;ant.&quot; In the U.S. it sold for $3.25, and I'd bet you could get that for a copy today. <br />Before reading this book I could look a word up in the dictionary and not ponder how it got there. No more, though. James Murray, who strove to define thirty-three words every day, describes how only one can give an editor a headache: <br />&quot;Only those who have made the experiment know the bewilderment with which editor or sub-editor, after he has apportioned the quotations for such a word as &quot;above&quot; among 20, 30 or 40 groups, and furnished each of these with a provisional definition, spreads them out on a table or on the floor where he can obtain a general survey of the whole, and spends hour after hour in shifting them about like pieces on a chess-board, striving to find in the fragmentary evidence of an incomplete historical record, such a sequence of meanings as may form a logical chain of development. Sometimes the quest seems hopeless; recently, for example, the word &quot;art&quot; utterly baffled me for several days: something had to be done with it: something was done and put in type; but the renewed consideration of it in print, with the greater facility of reading and comparison which this afforded, led to the entire pulling to pieces and reconstruction of the edifice, extending to several columns of type.&quot;<br />About defining words author Simon Winchester says, &quot;Defining words properly is a fine and peculiar craft. There are rules -- a word (to take a noun as an example) must first be defined according to the class of things to which it belongs (mammal, quadruped), and then differentiated from other members of that class (bovine, female). There must be no words in the definition that are more complicated or less likely to be known than the word being defined. The definition must say what something is, and not what it is not. If there is a range of meanings of any one word -- cow having a broad range of meanings, cower having essentially only one -- then they must be stated. And all the words in the definition must be found elsewhere in the dictionary. If the definer contrives to follow all these rules, stirs into the mix an ever-pressing need for concision and elegance and if he or she is true to the task, a proper definition will probably result.&quot;<br />One of the &quot;Many Scholars and Men of Science&quot; Dr. Murray referred to in the title of the first fascile was a Dr. William C. Minor, an American physician. He was formally honored by a mention in Volume 1; A-B, published in 1888. In 1890 Murray wrote, &quot;The supreme position [among the thousands of contributors] is certainly held by Dr. W.C. Minor of Broadmoor . . . So enormous have been Dr. Minor's contributions during the past 17 or 18 years that we could easily illustrate the last 4 centuries [of literature] from his quotations alone.&quot; Broadmoor was an asylum for the criminally insane, and Dr. Minor was confined there.<br />About seventy years after what would become the OED was conceived, the first edition was published on the very last day of 1927: &quot;Twelve mighty volumes; 414,825 words defined, 1,827,306 illustrative quotations used, to which Dr. Minor contributed scores of thousands.&quot; The total length of type -- 227,779,589 characters, every one hand set -- was 178 miles.<br />A grand achievement, one with incredible twists and turns. Sadly, neither Dr. Murray nor Dr. Minor lived to see it done. But I saw it from conception to completion through the eyes of Simon Winchester. For his splendid reconstruction of it I am grateful. Readers who don't like details might prefer to read the OED rather than the story of how it came to be.	2001-06-25

If Pauline thought she was overwhelmed with perils, she ought to read &quot;The Eye of the Tiger.&quot; More than once when I was wondering how Harry Fletcher would survive an ordeal I discovered that his troubles were only beginning. In an underwater adventure he had to do in a giant moray eel, fought off sharks followed by bigger and meaner sharks, encountered poisonous coral. He ran out of breathing air, got the bends.  He was beset with bad girls, battled waves of bad guys followed by badder guys, and meaner ones yet were on the way.  Traitors lurked within his ranks.<br />I found the story immensely entertaining.  It has been a long time since I've been gripped so by a tale.  I pursued it far into the night and finally had to make myself put it down.<br />The circumstances surrounding the sailing ship Dawn Light, and how it was discovered what she carried and where she went down, were particularly well crafted. Captivating.<br />Wilbur Smith dances dangerously close to the incredible time and again as he keeps his narrative running wildly along. Yet somehow he avoids that perilous step over the line of credibility.<br />At least he did so until the very end. There he didn't step across the line but pole-vaulted over it.  My delight was shattered by that one sledgehammer blow when he anchored a central theme of the story in quicksand.  The premise underlying Sherry North's (or whoever she was) motivation was totally at odds with international maritime laws regarding salvage of treasure. England had no jurisdiction over a century-old shipwreck half a world away. No English government agency would have behaved as Smith described. We were not offered the flimsiest reason or justification for England's interest, much less involvement. It pummeled common sense.  Smith obviously has the talent for imagining a plausible foundation for that critical aspect of the story. Why didn't he?<br />There were other irritations, minor ones that would have gone unmentioned but for the colossal one.  For instance, on his arrival in England Harry obtained a Benz from the Hertz depot. It continued as a Benz until midway through the episode, when it became a Chrysler. In the final scene, Harry narrates, &quot;I settled into the seat of the Swissair 727 and fastened my seat belt.&quot; Then two paragraphs later, &quot;As the Caravelle took off...&quot;<br />The description on the back of this paperback edition begins, &quot;For a thousand years, an unimaginable treasure has rested on the bottom of the Indian Ocean.&quot; It had been on the ocean floor a hundred years, not a thousand.	2001-06-10

My little library branch displayed among its new arrivals &quot;Somewhere In France&quot; by Gardiner. What led me to check it out I don't know. But I was glad I did.<br />In 1990 I was waiting to be checked out at a bookstore when my eye fell on Patrick O'Brian's &quot;Master and Commander,&quot; displayed alongside his &quot;Post Captain&quot; on a shelf below the counter. I'm not a big fan of sea stories. Had never heard of O'Brian (and wouldn't hear a peep about him out of the reviewers for a year). But I bought the book for reasons I'll never fathom. Next day I returned in a great fever to get &quot;Post Captain.&quot; Like a literary Johnny Appleseed, I have been turning friends on to O'Brian ever since.<br />In the early seventies I had never heard of the Swedish husband/wife writing team Maj Sjowall and Per Wahloo -- names that should have put me off. But some cosmic force compelled me to open their &quot;Roseanna&quot; and I was hooked. Still am.<br />For years, while re-reading their exquisite novels, I pondered what it is about them that is so satisfying to me. Their contempt for many police officers is one attraction. There are pilots who should never leave the ground, doctors who should never touch a patient, and so on. So it is not surprising there are police officers who belong in another line of work.<br />These novels describe fine detective work AND contemptible police work in delightful detail. It is often subtly hilarious if you are paying attention. In one of the stories a body was found in an enclosed snow-covered yard. A fine opportunity to examine clues, us armchair detectives note. Unfortunately, the two beat-cops who found the body idly strolled over every inch of the yard while waiting for the detectives to get to the scene.<br />There are reporters (probably a majority) who should be reading the news insteadof trying to write it. Woven into these stories are scenes that describe the incompetence of members of the press - high-up detectives have a lot of intercourse with the press.<br />An example is offered in a press conference early in &quot;The Laughing Policeman.&quot; A Stockholm bus is found with the driver and passengers dead. Among the passengers was a detective. One of Martin Beck's Homicide Division officers volunteered for the unpleasant task of conducting a press conference. The crime has only just occurred and little is yet known about it. Some of the questions are illustrative the Sjowall's and Wahloo's view of the press. (Sjowall was himself a reporter.) Some of the answers reveal the detectives' compulsion to play with their questioners. A few examples from a long conference:<br />Q: How many persons were in the bus?<br />A: Eight.<br />Q: Were they all dead?<br />A: Yes.<br />Q: Was their death caused by external violence?<br />A: Probably.<br />Q: Were there signs of shooting?<br />A: Yes.<br />Q: So all these people had been shot dead?<br />A: Probably.<br />Q: Are there any traces or clues that point to one particular person?<br />A: No.<br />Q: Were the murders committed by one and the same person?<br />A: Don't know.<br />Q: Is there anything to indicate that more than one person killed these eight people?<br />A: No.<br />Q: How could a single person kill eight people in a bus before anyone had time to resist?<br />A: Don't know.<br />Q: Was Inspector Stenstrom [the officer who was killed] one of the passengers in the bus?<br />A: He wasn't driving at any rate.<br />Superb writing. And the stories reek with credibility. The crimes are solved with dogged and sometimes brilliant detective work. Never by incredible coincidence. When there is a coincidence it is wholly credible - indeed, chance happenings often lead to the solutions of real crimes. Too often in real life, though, the coincidental discovery of evidence is ignored. Remember that the L.A. police spent months querying police departments nationwide about a .22 revolver that might have been used by the Charles Manson gang. The father and son who found the gun in Laurel Canyon and turned it in gave up after repeatedly reminding LAPD that they probably had the gun. They finally appealed to a TV reporter who woke the cops up by threatening to go public with the info. (Read &quot;Helter Skelter.&quot;)<br />Judging by some comments below, as a Sjowall/Wahloo fan I'm in good company.<br />Warning:  Those who read with their minds in Park won't fathom some of this. And if you are really hooked on a few of the hot crime writers of today that come to my mind, you might not like this realistic stuff.	2001-05-01

U.S. Army Major William Lloyd, M.D., had given up his practice at Roosevelt Hospital in New York to do something important for his country. Now he was somewhere in France. That somewhere, which the mail censors faithfully blotted from his letters to a dysfunctional family back home, was Chaumont.<br />A passage: &quot;On October 3, 1917, a few days before his American medical team arrived to join him in Chaumont, Major  Lloyd entered the Hotel Rive Haute for a final inspection. As a roving officer of the Chief Surgeon's staff, he had requisitioned the building for Base Hospital 15 of the Allied Expeditionary Force. A few French casualties were temporarily in beds on the floor, attended by a single French doctor.&quot; <br />Base Hospital 15 would soon be doing a thriving business.<br />Another passage: &quot;The first person Dr. Lloyd encountered was one on hands-and-knees, scrubbing the floor. &quot;There was a powerful smell of ammonia around him. It was perfume to the Major's sense of hygiene. This, and the picture of the poor man at his thankless task, turned the officer's mood, filled him with pity and self-reproach. Good enough, he thought, the man must come with the building. I'll make a place for him in the table of organization. `Well done. What's your name.' &quot;<br />HER name was Jeanne Prie (when she wasn't Lucienne de Crouen) -- nurse. Dr. Lloyd made a place for her in his table of organization.  She had chosen Jeanne after Jeanne d'Arc (no doubt out of admiration, not imitation, for Joan of Arc is inimitable). She proved to be a credible stand-in for Madame Marie Curie, working tirelessly to concoct vaccines against infections of unknown origins. Unintentionally, Lloyd would secure for himself a place in her life long after his table of organization ceased to exist.<br />An Irishman whose name won't come to mind said unlike a bird we can't, in a story, be in two places at the same time. He should read this, for we often find ourselves with one foot in Chaumont and the other in the family estate of Moriches on Long Island, and that accounts for some of the magic of this story. One element of our magic carpet is Gardiner's craftsmanlike way of putting us observers in one place then the other without our being conscious of our having been transported. <br />Another element is a flow of newsy letters between Lloyd and his wife, instinctively censored by both as they put the best faces on their theaters of operations. Dr. Lloyd's present persona is buttressed by a larger than life view of William Lloyd the schoolboy, resurrected by candid letters to his parents way back when.<br />Gardiner's writing style is as compelling as the story itself - something we hope (and deserve) to find often but don't, especially in current best-sellers.  Part of his magic may be attributable to his having had a splendid editor.  He offers a prefatory note of thanks to Knopf editor Ann Close, recognized as one of the best around today.<br />While reading this story I wondered how Gardiner came to conceive it. Lo and behold, at the back of the book is his answer to that very question. Very touching, too.	2001-05-01

True, all personal accounts of war are highly focused, confined as they are to the tight little theater of each writer's involvement. Or involvements as in the case of that German officer's memorable account of his entire career, &quot;Soldat.&quot;<br />Here, Hynes zooms out, assembling with great skill personal micro-views that together are a broad picture of war. His narrative weaves the recollections into a whole fabric.<br />Some sage once observed that old men start wars and young men fight them. Old men write glorious and expansive military histories, the young men who fought the battles write about the miseries of the battlefields -- and, occasionally the humor -- and the miseries of captivity. Soldiers who were unlucky enough to be prisoners of the Japanese became the real experts on the miseries of captivity.<br />This excellent book is marred at the end by an almost apologetic discussion of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. That kind of warfare was unique, says Hynes, and so it was, being the only uses of nuclear bombs in world history. But what was the alternative? An invasion of a nation that had demonstrated repeatedly that every soldier would fight to the death? And at what cost, another several hundred thousand allied dead? Hynes writes:<br />&quot;And although [the bombing] was an attack not on a specific military target but on a city, that was not new in August 1945; many cities were in ashes by then. But it was a strange, unique act of war; an action without a battle, without armies, without a visible enemy, in which neither courage nor cowardice mattered; an action for which there was no possible retaliation; an action so far outside the capabilities of armies up to then that it seemed like some catastrophic natural disaster -- only it was UNnatural. That was what was most disturbing about it, and still is. . . . So it was different from other bombed, burned-out cities, where there were guns and fighter planes to oppose the attack. . . It is more entirely a victim war than Auschwitz, where resistance was just barely possible and survival might be an act of will; more than the prisoner-of-war camps, helpless though those captives sometimes were. It was a unique event in the history of man's capacity to destroy his species.&quot;<br />By demonstrating that the U.S. DID have the capacity to level  the entire island nation of Japan -- if not the ability to destroy the species of man -- a beaten but still ferocious warring nation was brought to the table.<br />The casualties in Hiroshima and Nagasaki combined were perhaps less than the deaths in that single massacre in Nanking, China, where Japanese soldiers systematically killed between 100,000 and 300,000 men, women and children. Shot them one by one. But somehow, in Hynes's view, that kind of killing is war, where the unprecedented atomic explosions were not war, but something else, something UNnatural. I don't agree. Was the barbarism of the Japanese military during WWII natural? I don't think so.<br />Regardless of this objection, I consider &quot;The Soldiers' Tale&quot; to be an outstanding contribution to war literature.	2001-01-26

All these many years I've been reading mysteries and adventure stories by the likes of Dashiell Hammett, John LeCarre, Len Deighton, Patrick O'Brian, Agatha Christie, Ellery Queen, Edgar Allen Poe ... and believing all the time I was enjoying them.<br />Then one day a friend handed me &quot;O is For Outlaw&quot;. I wasn't forty pages into it before all my literary favorites went up in smoke.<br />Could any other character in all of literature possess the pluck, the derring-do, the limitless bravado of the hugely popular Kinsey Millhone? Teddy Rich would sell her the name of a certain storage place for $30. Kinsey decides instead to get it free by burglarizing Teddy's home. It wasn't that Kinsey was short on funds. Indeed, she was taking a breather after concluding a job that left her with a fat bank account.<br />Never mind that she has only three hours after leaving Terry to pull off the caper, and that she doesn't know his physical address. Kinsey solved the address problem by calling the U.S. Postal Service from a pay phone and having them cross-search by his PO Box number. (Dumb me! I'm so inarticulate with the USPS by phone that I can't even learn the cost of mailing a package of known weight from one ZIP to another.) Never mind that the document of unknown size or appearance might not even be in Terry's house, and may be buried in a mountain of trashy files if it is. For this scene to work the paper has to be lying right out where Kinsey can snatch it during a hit-and-run job. Lo and behold, it is, and she does. This stuff is not for the faint-hearted.<br />Ex-cop and licensed private eye Kinsey has to know burglary is a felony, an offense that could end her gumshoe profession, not to mention land her in jail. She would know, too, that the California Penal Code justifies use of deadly force by citizens to prevent burglary, statutory justification which was made more emphatic following a little housebreaking and entering spree some might recall. During that spree, Sharon Tate and friends were murdered, and a few nights later Gino La Bianca and his wife were slain in their home. The rampage is generally known as the Charles Manson murders. A private eye would be a little cautious about breaking and entering.<br />Who else in literature would give us such nail-biting thrills when Kinsey could have denied us them for a measly thirty bucks? And it wasn't that she was so desperate for the name of the business that she burgled the house, even if it saved her $30. In fact, she didn't even want it. Even after she got it she wondered why she had gone to the trouble. But Kinsey wasn't yet in on what old Fate was up to.<br />Now, a scene designer of lesser genius would have made the information critical to Kinsey, and then had Teddy refuse to sell it to her, making the burglary mandatory, and (ahem) lend it credibility. Fearless, indomitable Kinsey! Living on the ragged edge, and when there isn't an edge she creates one. Now I know why people undertake the perilous ascent of Mt. Everest, knowing beforehand that their frozen remains may reside forever on that rarefied slope. Mike Hammer, Nero Wolfe, Sam Spade - spineless wimps compared to Kinsey Millhone.<br />I just love the way Grafton describes like an interior decorator the details of every structure in which Kinsey finds herself. Architectural Digest without the pictures. And she does so with street scenes as well, however dull they might be. By golly, us readers have a right to have our noses rubbed in the good, the bad, and the ugly!<br />And gosh, how grateful I am when a story gives me new perspectives on things. I'll bet there were throngs of readers like me who appreciated learning that peanut butter looks like caramel colored goo. All my life I had thought peanut butter looked like ... well, like peanut butter. For those legions of us with no mental image of pickle slices, we are told they look like green polka dots. Well, they don't really, but the metaphor might help us discern pickle slices from salami slices.<br />As loath as I am to draw attention to an act of heroism of my own, I must if this is to be a sincere and candid review. I stopped reading on page 40. Scout's honor, I did. I did it knowing that in my hands was THE work that shines like Venus in the night sky, a work whose equal will never be seen in ten thousand years.<br />But I must admit to a cowardly reason for denying myself this treasure of a hundred lifetimes. I can henceforth go on reading and enjoying the common works.	2001-01-19

Each word seems as carefully selected as if they were rounds of  super-match ammunition loaded with the most infinite attention  for bull's-eye accuracy.<br />It is a complete story, with a beginning, a middle and an end.  Entirely credible, too. A man is so physically deformed as to  seem hideous to others, so he seeks and finds solitude, as near  as that can be done. But he is a man with a big and wonderful  heart whose friends are birds. Birds know not of human physical  characteristics, but they instinctively loved this man who  offended the critical eyes of other humans. They loved him because he earned their love, because he deserved to be loved.<br />A scared, timid little girl came to him to obtain help for an  injured snow goose. Firth, too, was repelled by what she saw. But over time she became acquainted with the man within the ugly  shell, and her eyes, and her heart, began to see the beauty that <br />resided there.<br />It was true to Philip's character that he would sail his little  boat to assist in the evacuation of Dunkirk on that besieged  Belgium coast. Many lesser men did so as well. It is not unheard  of that wild geese have become inseparably attached to humans.  Certainly the snow goose in this story could easily have  developed such a bond with Philip.<br />There is quite a story here. And told in only 6000 super-match- quality words. It pleases me that it has been reprinted some 70- odd times since first published in 1941, and that it is still in  print, and similar to the original format.<br />I can't see where some readers get the notion that &quot;The Snow  Goose&quot; is a story for children - maybe because it is told in so  few words. It is an entire and compelling story as told. There  was nothing left to tell. If this story had been written by any  one of several of the best-selling authors of today, it could  easily have filled 500 &quot;sea-of-ink&quot; marginless pagesinstead of  the 58 appealingly airy pages that it does. But we would wonder  when closing it what it was about.<br />&quot;The Snow Goose&quot; is a book for everyone who can read.	2001-01-15

And he can write, a  skill not demonstrated sufficiently in some books on writing. He is a  literary agent, one who has represented some high-profile writers. Dealing,  as he has, with editors at big publishing houses, he must have some insight  into what they want to see in a manuscript.<br />The best time to get into  &quot;The First Five Pages&quot; is when you have a work in progress. Only  then can you apply his advice in a practical way. Of course, this applies  to any book on writing. You can't collect advice about writing on your  mental hard drive for later retrieval.<br />Lukeman introduces his book  thusly: &quot;There are no rules to assure great writing, but there are  ways to avoid bad writing... By scrutinizing the following examples of what  NOT to do, you will learn to spot those ailments in your own writing; by  working with the solutions and exercises, you can, over time, bridge the  gap and come to a realization of what TO do.&quot;<br />He also says,  importantly, &quot;By its end, you'll come to see why this book should not  have been titled &quot;The First Five Pages&quot; but &quot;The First Five  Sentences&quot;. This comment gave great weight to advice (a demand,  actually) from another writer that I move a scene from paragraph three to  paragraph one. The impact was dramatic.<br />Elements of this book can be  applied from first page to last, for he covers much of the waterfront on  writing for publication. Also, there is advice on contacting agents and  publishers, many nitty little details of what should and should not be  found in a manuscript.<br />Sure, Lukeman covers much of the same ground found  in other good books on writing. But he presents it in his own style, giving  it a refreshing perspective.<br />A worthwhile book, this is. Mine is studded  with Post-It Notes, profusely underlined. It is right here on my desk,  alongside &quot;Stein on Writing&quot; and a very few others.When I  recently &quot;finished&quot; a story, I read this book again and some  triggers clicked, inspiring me to make a few changes.<br />Now the question  is: Who is going to read even the first five pages?	2000-09-03

He first enlisted in the Youth Corps, trained with great zeal  while shouldering his immaculately polished shovel. He progressed into a  soldier, then a worthy officer whose instilled patriotism and discipline  allowed no criticism of the WHY he was involved.<br />This is a rare insight  into the German military, coming not from a historian but from the heart  and mind of a soldier, a &quot;soldat.&quot;<br />A most worthy insight into  total indoctrination. It shows why the German forces were so dedicated,  professional and tenacious, why they retained those qualities even in  defeat, why they had to be driven foot-by-foot out of Russia and through  France, all the way to Berlin.<br />But for some grave mistakes by Hitler --  the first was allowing the half-million British Expeditionary Force to be  evacuated from Dunkirk, and continuing with the insanity of opening a whole  new front with Russia, throwing away the nation's finest Army on a  senseless adventure (was it the Sixth Army?) -- and some bad luck Germany  might have won WWII or forced unpleasant accommodations on its  enemies.<br />The view of Hitler at the end, cowering in his bunker until the  moment he would commit suicide, knowing that Berlin was being destroyed  needlessly and certain that Germany was beaten. The picture of Hitler  refusing to permit the capitulation that would have saved his country from  awesome destruction after all was lost. The Russians took gleeful advantage  of the opportunity to pummel a prostrate Berlin.<br />Knappe stuck to his  duties to the end. Instead of joining other officers who were arranging to  have themselves captured by the Western Allies he stayed on to be delivered  into Russian captivity.<br />Knappe's memoir is worthwhile reading, a useful  look inside one of the millions of decent minds Hitler converted to his  cause.	2000-08-23

A fair part of my knowledge came  from this book. The rest I obtained by personally visiting several  countries and actually going through the process of setting up corporations  and bank accounts.<br />Smathers is a professional in the fields of accounting  and investment management. He recommends The Bahamas as a favorite place to  do offshore investing, and so do I. The Bahamian laws pertaining to  banking, international business corporations, their zeal to protect the  country's reputation as a financial center (about 17% of the its income  comes from this one business), and the proximity to the U.S. make The  Bahamas the ideal place to do offshore banking.<br />There are two huge trust  companies there who can help investors set up and manage trusts, if that's  what they want to do.<br />Scott Smathers advises correctly in this book just  what one must do to stay within the U.S. tax code. A bit of reading between  the lines will suggest to the more adventurous how to work the gray area --  that thin place between black and white.<br />Offshore investing isn't for  somebody with a small amount of money to invest. But for those with several  hundred thousand, much can be saved with proper offshore management.  Furthermore, assets there are safe from lawsuits and the like, for they are  not discoverable. The Bahamas have tightened their secrecy laws to the  point that one can make his assets undiscoverable even to the government  there, or anyone else.	2000-08-18

He was unpopular with some powerful members of the political  structure in place. They had deserted Neville Chamberlain but had not  conferred their full allegiance on Churchill. Churchill's principle  opponent was not Chamberlain, but Lord Halifax and the man who had his ear,  the rich &quot;consummate intriguer and wire-puller&quot;, R.A.  Butler.<br />In 1938 Butler, aware of the German anger at some British  newspapers, devised a plan to influence the press, to &quot;(a) see that  our case [of appeasing Germany] is well represented, (b) see that the  correspondence columns everywhere are well-stacked with arguments written  by our friends, (c) see that our speeches are better heard and known to our  opponents' or semi-opponents', e.g. Winston's campaign should be  watched.&quot;<br />Fortunately, during the decisive four days chronicled in  this book, Butler -- whose voice of appeasement was so strident that he was  losing ears willing to listen to it -- would not be an important player. I  mention Undersecretary of State Butler only because his views were shared  by an important minority of British politicians and citizens horrified by  the prospects of an all-out war with Germany.<br />A half-million British  soldiers of the British Expeditionary Forces, which included some French as  well, were stranded at Dunkirk, Belgium. A decisive blow by Hitler could  have annihilated them, causing England the greatest military defeat in  centuries. (There is still considerable wonderment why they weren't, why  England was allowed to to pursue unmolested the massive effort to evacuate  them.)<br />The United States was sitting on her hands, unwilling to take a  stance on the British side.<br />France was about to (and soon did)  capitulate, to enter into an agreement with Hitler to end  hostilities.<br />Some Englishministers talked about evacuating the  government, something Churchill was adamantly opposed to.<br />In May of 1940,  things could hardly have looked bleaker for England. Churchill's task was  daunting: to keep the political branch of England steady on the course of  resistance, resistance to the last if it came to that, and here's how Lucas  described the critical debates:<br />&quot;The Prime Minister said it was  impossible to imagine that Herr Hitler would be so foolish as to allow [a  capitulated England] to continue our re-armament. In effect, his terms  would put us completely at his mercy. We should get no worse terms if we  went on fighting, even if we were beaten, than were open to us now. If,  however, we continued the war and Germany attacked us, no doubt we would  suffer some damage, but they would also suffer severe losses ... A time  might come when we felt that we had to put an end to the struggle, but the  terms would not then be more mortal than those offered to us  now.<br />&quot;The Foreign Secretary said that he still did not see what  there was in the French suggestion of trying out the possibilities of  mediation which the Prime Minister felt so wrong.<br />&quot;The Prime  Minister said that the nations which went down fighting rose again, but  those which surrendered tamely were finished.<br />&quot;The Foreign Secretary  said that nothing in his suggestion could even remotely be described as  ultimate capitulation.<br />&quot;The Prime Minister thought that the chances  of decent terms being offered to us at the present were a thousand to  one.&quot;<br />This exchange took place before the five-man War Cabinet on  May 28th. Churchill asked for a temporary adjournment to address the larger  Outer Cabinet. To those members, he admitted that it was his duty to  consider negotiations with Hitler. But, he concluded, &quot;it was idle to  think that, if we tried to make peace now, we should get better terms from  Germany than if we went on and fought it out. The Germans would demand our  fleet -- that would be called 'disarmament' -- our naval bases, and much  else. We should become a slave state, though a British government which  would be Hitler's puppet would be set up -- under Mosely or some such  person. And where would we be at the end of all that?&quot;<br />Later in the  discussion, when Churchill was winning the day, Halifax revived a  suggestion that England appeal to President Roosevelt.<br />&quot;Churchill  thought that an appeal to the United States at the present time would be  altogether premature. 'If we made a bold stand against Germany, that would  command their admiration and respect; but a groveling appeal, if made now,  would have the worst possible effect.'&quot;<br />&quot;That was the end of  it, as Andrew Roberts properly wrote: 'Churchill's instincts proved  correct. Halifax had attempted to bring logic and reason to a problem long  since devoid of either ...	2000-08-15

We travel with the peaceful Indians who migrated from  Wyoming through Nebraska and New Mexico into Texas, afoot and gathering  their food from wild plants. The &quot;lowly gatherers&quot;, they were  called, confined to the ground they could cover on foot, and little match  for the fleet game that abounded on every hand.<br />But when they encountered  horses brought in by the Spanish they became obsessed with horsemanship.  Large numbers of horses were stolen in nighttime raids on Spanish remudas  and the &quot;gatherers&quot; were transformed into the fiercest Indians on  the North American continent: the Comanches.<br />With their new mobility they  could appear from nowhere, strike the Spanish settlements and disappear  into nowhere like the passing wind. Better horsemen have never lived, and  horses have never been used as instruments of war with such expertness as  they were used by the Comanches. The Spanish incursion was pushed back, and  further back.<br />So when Stephen F. Austin applied to the Mexican  authorities to settle eastern Texas he was seen as added defenses against  the marauding Comanches. Houston was given huge grants of land and he  brought in settlers. Spanish soldiers -- fighting for they knew not what --  were one thing. Men fighting the Comanches to protect their homesteads were  something else, and they fought back blow for blow. So the Comanches were  encouraged to occupy west Texas, leaving the settlers the eastern part of  the land pretty much alone.<br />At some point the Mexican authorities became  uneasy over the large numbers of settlers coming in and friction arose.  Austin was forcibly detained during a negotiating confab in Mexico, but  still the settlers came. Eventually, after Houston's release, the  differences between the settlers and their Spanish overlords became  hostilities that ultimately led to the Battle of the Alamo. The long siege  of the Alamo allowed a prolonged consolidation and retreat of General Sam  Houston's ragtag army -- a retreat that was roundly criticized by  politicians issuing proclamations from their comfortable homes -- that  ended in the decisive fight for independence in a low-lying palmetto and  scrub-oak studded swamp east of today's Houston -- the Battle of San  Jacinto.<br />There, 800 untrained but well-led and determined Texians staged  a daring midday attack on the 1,500-man Mexican army led by the feared  General Santa Anna -- a confident army enjoying its siesta, arms neatly  stacked. It was Santa Anna who had taken over the Alamo siege from his  subordinate and ended the holdout, and it was he who would annihilate the  Texian army once and for all. But in less than an hour General Sam  Houston's men, shouting &quot;Remember the Alamo&quot; and &quot;Remember  Goliad&quot; killed 600 Mexicans and wounded 200. They would capture 700,  including Santa Anna. The general had disguised himself as a common  soldier, but was unveiled when an officer saluted him.<br />Six of General  Houston's men were killed and 30 wounded. Texas was free of Mexican rule  forever and The Republic of Texas was a reality. Texas bred some ferocious  fighters, and from their ranks evolved a group of lawmen/fighters never  equaled in U.S. history: The Texas Rangers -- not the politicized force of  today, but a strategic fighting unit of such gritty ferociousness that it  could, and did, change the course of a war.<br />It pulled General Zachary  Taylor's fat out of the fire in the war between the U.S. and Mexico in  1846, allowing victory at Monterey. The Rangers applied their uncanny  scouting skills, learned from the Comanches, to discover the precise  locations and numbers of Mexican field units. This tactical advantage, plus  theRangers' superbly effective strategies and fearless battle tactics that  harried the Mexican army, were critical to the U.S. victory at  Monterey.<br />It was during the 8-week truce there, while the city was  occupied by Taylor's army, that a hapless Mexican snatched a bandanna from  a mounted Ranger and was shot dead in his tracks. Taylor brought in the  Rangers' Captain to dress him down, only to be told that the Captain would  not order his men to tolerate the slightest display of disrespect from a  Mexican.<br />General Taylor and the Rangers won the north of Mexico. Taylor  went on to become president. Ranger Rip Ford remained a Ranger. Even when  the state had become relatively peaceful, Ford would emerge from his San  Antonio hotel, stand quiet and still in the shadow of the porch, hand on  his Colt, wary eyes examining the street scene before venturing  forth.<br />Texas was an independent Republic when it joined the United  States, which is why none of its territory would be carved out and reserved  by the U.S. Government, as happened to every other state that was  &quot;granted&quot; statehood. Those portions of Texas now owned by the  U.S. were sold or granted to the federal government by the State for some  specific purpose...Rangers' superbly effective strategies and fearless battle tactics that  harried the Mexican army, were critical to the U.S. victory at  Monterey.<br />It was during the 8-week truce there, while the city was  occupied by Taylor's army, that a hapless Mexican snatched a bandanna from  a mounted Ranger and was shot dead in his tracks.

A review of this book by me, or even a thoughtful critique,could add nothing to what has been so well-said in the numerouseloquent essays among the 200 below. Among the decisively best dozen, reviewer Barron T. Laycock, only a few reviews below, describes &quot;Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance&quot; about as well as it need be done. Another finely-drawn perspective is provided immediately below by reviewer Cicha1994, who gets to the bottom of Pirsig's magic of delivering an incredibly complex synthesis with timely spoonfuls of sugar thusly:<br />&quot;Mr. Pirsig has an uncanny sense of timing, and he never allows the heavier passages to labor on too long. This is avoided by craftily interspersing his philosophical discourse amongst very down-to-earth and charming observations made during a motorcycle trip ...&quot;<br />Not daring to venture into the rarified air of the erudite reviews already here, I humbly offer a more fundamental observation, one that is &quot;down-to-earth as fertilizer,&quot; as we say.<br />How I came to read this book the first time -- of how many? -- I can't imagine. I have no interest in Zen, never owned a motorcycle and so needed no advice about keeping one humming. What I found I did have very strong interests in was everything Persig had to say.<br />&quot;Zen and the Art...&quot; was an immediate best-seller when it was published 26 years ago. That couldn't have inspired my interest in it, for I have instinctive misgivings about best-sellers. But I did read it and have been all the better for it. Every subsequent reading has opened a little door or niche missed before. <br />Call any used book store and mention of &quot;Zen and the Art...&quot; and you'll get immediate recognition of it, often a comment like, &quot;Oh, yeah. That Robert Persig book. No, we can't keep them.&quot; Still selling like crazy, after all these years.<br />There is a positively bone-chilling aspect about &quot;Zen and the Art...&quot;. The millions whohave read this supreme intellectual and artistic masterpiece -- many, many of whom, like me, were profoundly enriched by it -- came perilously close to being denied the experience. If memory serves, Persig's manuscript was rejected 122 times before William Morrow picked it up (probably after having also rejected it a few times). That says volumes about the dismal state of publishing back then, an industry that is in even blacker depths today.	2000-07-22
US	52742526	R2XZPZADIKWLAW	0312209495	868204675	How to Grow a Novel: The Most Common Mistakes Writers Make and How to Overcome Them	Books	5	53	66	N	N	Yet another sharp arrow for your literary quiver	Coming right on the heels of Stein's &quot;Stein on Writing&quot;, I was apprehensive that &quot;How to Grow a Novel&quot; might be a rehash of it. With the former seeming to be such a full treatment of both fiction and  nonfiction, what more could Stein have to say?<br />A lot. I will offer one  example. Chapter two of &quot;How to Grow a Novel&quot; focuses on  conflict. He reminds us that conflict need not be a knock-down-drag-out  fight. He writes, &quot;Many people ... bristle at the term `conflict'  because of memories and overtones, and so I propose another term for their  consideration, `adversarial... The conflict is often verbal, not high drama,  sometimes even mundane.&quot;<br />While reading Stein's words on conflict, I  was reminded of a scene in &quot;Emma&quot; by Jane Austen that so clearly  demonstrates low-key, verbal conflict.<br />Emma's governess, who has evolved  into the dearest friend Emma has in the world, has married and gone. The  conflict within Emma over the loss of Miss Taylor, and shared by her father  (&quot;Poor Miss Taylor,&quot; he said at their first dinner without her,  &quot;What a pity it is that Mr. Weston ever thought of her!&quot;) has  been exposed in detail when an intimate friend of the family drops in. Mr.  Knightly is a man some 18 years older than 21-year-old Emma and &quot;one  of the few people who could see faults in Emma Woodhouse, and the only one  who ever told her of them.&quot;<br />The absent Miss Taylor is, of course, on  their minds and tongues. Mr. Knightly observes, &quot;Every friend of Miss  Taylor must be glad to have her so happily married.&quot;<br />&quot;And you  have forgotten one matter of joy to me,&quot; said Emma, &quot;and a very  considerable one -- that I made the match myself. I made the match, you  know, four years ago; and to have it take place, and be proved in the right  . . . And after such a success, you know! Everybody said that Mr. Weston  would never marry again.&quot;<br />Mr. Knightly shook his head at her.  &quot;I do not understand what you mean by `success,' Success supposes  endeavor. Your time has been properly and delicately spent, if you have  been endeavoring for the last fours to bring about this marriage. A worthy  employment for a young lady's mind! But if, which I rather imagine, your  making the match, as you call it, means only your planning it, your saying  to yourself one idle day, `I think it would be a very good thing for Miss  Taylor if Mr. Weston were to marry her,' and saying it again to yourself  every now and then afterwards -- why do you talk of success? Where is your  merit? What are you proud of? You made a lucky guess; and THAT is all that  can be said.&quot;<br />After more debate, Emma said, &quot;And as to my poor  word `success,' which you quarrel with, I do not know that I am so entirely  without claim to it. You have drawn two pretty pictures; but I think there  may be a third -- something between the do-nothing and the do-all. If I had  not promoted Mr. Weston's visits here, and given many little  encouragements, and smoothed many little matters, it might not have come to  anything after all.&quot;<br />Mr. Knightly yields not an inch, saying,  &quot;A straightforward, open-hearted man like Mr. Weston, and a rational,  unaffected woman like Miss Taylor may be safely left to manage their own  concerns. You are more likely to have done harm to yourself, than good to  them, by interference.&quot;<br />This is conflict indeed, escalating  conflict, even if it is kept on a genteel level. One can feel Emma's pulse  rising, sense Mr. Knightly's deepening smugness, while through it all the  narrator's voice is almost silent. While few writers have wielded their  literary rapiers as deftly as Jane Austen, her demonstrations of conflict  are what I believe Stein wants us to strive for, when appropriate.<br />I feel  certain that Stein has never once implied that he discovered the Rosetta  stone of writing. His guidance is based on techniques so fundamental that  Jane Austen applied them 180 years ago, Shakespeare more than 200 years  sooner yet. Those of us who write, much like other craftsmen, must  constantly hone our skills, discovering and re-discovering techniques as  old as the hills, if we are to improve them. In both of his books, Mr.  Stein provides us with valuable, thought-provoking  &quot;discoveries.&quot;<br />I don't see how anyone can learn to cook by  reading cookbooks yet not attempting the dishes described. Similarly, it  seems that reading about writing and storing the information away in one's  head for future use would be of little use. Fortunately for me, I'm never  without a work in progress. Currently it's a near-finished novel that has  given me a lot of trouble -- numerous scenes required &quot;fixing.&quot;  Every one of the problem areas I'm aware of is in my mind being worried  over from time to time. As I read Stein's books, solutions to problems  frequently pop out at me -- I see what is at the heart of this problem,  that one. I go to work on the one at hand and often it is fixed.	2000-07-11

She read them, too, even if she indulged in little adventurous cooking. I often wondered how one could find entertainment reading recipes - was the recreation as  adventurous as poring over the instructions for assembling a barbecue pit  one was not going to assemble?<br />Perhaps if I had peeked into her cookbooks  I would have discovered some enchanting prose among the recipes, as I have  in &quot;Lobscouse &amp; Spotted Dog&quot;. Open the book anywhere ... Aah,  here on page 92 is the recipe for drowned baby, also called boiled baby,  introduced by this passage from &quot;The Nutmeg of  Consolation&quot;:<br />&quot;The gunroom feast for the Captain was if  anything more copious than that of the day before. The gunroom cook, by  means known to himself alone, had conserved the makings of a superb suet  pudding of the kind called boiled baby in the service, known to be Jack  Aubrey's favourite form of food, and it came in on a scrubbed scuttle-cover  to the sound of cheering.&quot;<br />Sure, I read this passage during my  several reads of &quot;Nutmeg&quot;, but standing here alone it seems to  sparkle with more clarity. Now I clearly see the pudding, gliding in on a  scrubbed wooden hatch cover (to the surprise of no one there) and I thrill  to the sound of cheering.<br />Here, once again, the perfect team has stepped  forward to contribute an enchanting and tantalizing contribution to the  Aubrey/Maturin series. A daunting task it must have been for this  multi-talented mother and daughter (sailboaters, too, they are), to unearth  and translate into modern terms the scores of recipes found in this book,  to translate the contemporary equivalents of their ingredients.<br />And, in  addition to its being seasoned with exquisite excerpts from the novels, we  are served a selection of the songs encountered in the stories - words and  music.<br />While you are satisfying your literary and musical appetites,you  can sample some of these recipes. I found I could actually create the ones  I've tried. To think that now I've figuratively dined with Aubrey and  Maturin (&quot;There you are, Doctor. Good morning.&quot;), Tom Pullings,  William Babbington, Mowett ...<br />What is it about Patrick O'Brian's writing  that so challenges and inspires readers of such fine tastes and writing  ability of their own? First, it was A.E. Cunningham, who edited  &quot;Patrick O'Brian: Critical Essays and a Bibliography&quot;, a  wonderfully enlightening collection of articles published not too long  after the O'Brian wave swept ashore.<br />Then came Dean King with &quot;A Sea  of Words&quot;, his splendid glossary of everything we couldn't fathom in  O'Brian's sea stories. With John B. Hattendorf, King followed with  &quot;Harbors &amp; High Seas,&quot; a desperately needed atlas and  geographical guide to the stories. And right on the heels of those came  this beautiful work of art, a cookbook like no other. Happily, I have not  observed evidence of an opportunist at work among those contributing to  O'Brian's legacy.<br />&quot;Lobscouse &amp; Spotted Dog&quot; is another  brilliant achievement, infinitely worthy of standing at muster alongside  the O'Brian stories and the other contributions to them. Authors Anne  Chotzinoff Grossman and Lisa Grossman Thomas have labored mightily to  assemble these recipes, and to season them with such delicate care. That  much is evident even to the meanest understanding. Patrick O'Brian himself  recognized the quality of this work and provided its apt foreword. Not  surprisingly, publisher W.W. Norton put it all together very nicely.<br />A  glass of wine with you, my dears. And let us also raise a toast to my  Amazon.com friend who knew, just KNEW, that I would love your book.	2000-07-08
US	52742526	R26HIRGFBP4OST	0140178244	389297184	Cadillac Desert: The American West and Its Disappearing Water, Revised Edition	Books	5	6	8	N	N	Water, water everywhere. Except in deserts.	This outstanding history of a century of water projects is a lot to get your arms around -- 50,000 major dams provide a vulgar extravagance of water for desert metros like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver, El  Paso, Tucson ... Trillions of dollars spent. A perpetual stream of the  boldest lying imaginable (for the times), graft, theft, piracy, and  political corruption was behind many of the projects.<br />Regarding the water  projects built over the last 150 years, Reisner wonders, &quot;What has it  all amounted to? ... Not all that much ... Modern Utah, where large-scale  irrigation has been going on longer than anywhere else, has 3 percent of  its land area under cultivation. California has 1,200 major dams, the two  biggest irrigation projects on earth ... but its irrigated acreage is not  much larger than Vermont.<br />Owens Lake in California dated back to the Ice  Age. In 1905 it was about 35 feet deep and covered over 100 square miles.  It was plied by steamboats. An Eden sparkled along the Owens Valley while  snow sparkled nearby on Mt. Whitney, the highest peak between Canada and  Mexico. It was so productive agriculturally that there was talk of building  a railroad to carry the produce to Los Angeles.<br />But Los Angeles wanted  the Owens Valley's water. And L.A., although 250 miles away, was 4,000 feet  downhill. With a population in 1907 of 500,000, the city had enormous  political power and a cell of brutally cunning politicians - they inspired  the U.S. Forest Service to designate much of the treeless Owens Valley a  National Forest to seal the valley's doom. In 1913  the Los Angeles  Aqueduct was completed and the Owens River started flowing on to Los  Angeles. Coincidentally, L.A. would need only a fraction of the water for  years, so it was used for - guess what? -- irrigating desert land in the  San Fernando Valley that had been bought up by a syndicate. The syndicate's  clairvoyant members were the arch capitalists of Los Angeles: the two  owners of the L.A. Times and other molders of public acquiescence, the  chairman of the Union Pacific Railroad, bank presidents, power company  executives ... Five years later 75,000 acres of San Fernando Valley desert  were under irrigation with water paid for by the taxpayers, almost as much  land as was dropping OUT of production in the Owens Valley. Land values  increased a hundred fold.<br />From 1913 until 1990, Los Angeleans were  supposed to just use water, not think about it, certainly not to worry  about where it came from to transform their glaring desert into a  Babylonian garden with its thirsty lawns, hedges and palm trees, with  thousands of decorative fountains and waterfalls, swimming pools, even  cooling mists sprayed into the air where people congregated. It wasn't  until 77 years after the rape of Owens Valley that L.A. first began  promoting water conservation.<br />Thirteen years after the Los Angeles  Aqueduct began flowing, Owens Lake was dry. The people of the Owens Valley  did not go peacefully into oblivion. They occupied the aqueduct's flood  gates and turned the water into the desert. Eventually they were driven  off, then a series of explosions destroyed seventeen sections of the  aqueduct. Finally, an army of Los Angeles police put an end to the  resistance.<br />The rape of Owens Valley started a feverish race between the  competing U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the Bureau of Reclamation to  throw dams across every waterway in the country. Major rivers were dammed  time and time again. Not one good unused dam site remains in the U.S.  Projects like Hoover Dam were extremely beneficial. Without its output of  electricity, West Coast industries might not have produced the aluminum and  the thousands of planes it took to win WW II. Lake Mead has made an oasis  out of Las Vegas. A network of canals laid in the Mojave Desert offers  waterfront homesites! Many of the projects, however, were based on  arithmetic that would have earneda schoolboy failing grades.<br />The dams  were big and bigger. &quot;Hoover was big; Shasta was half again as big;  Grand Coulee was bigger than both together ... The largest and longest  concrete dam in the world ... so massive it would have ordinarily taken  hundreds of years to cool down [as the concrete cured] and cooling pipe had  to be laid through it at close intervals ... The pipe would have connected  Seattle to Chicago.&quot;<br />The story of Teton Dam (a Bureau dam) is a  tragedy. Geologists recoiled at the idea of a dam at the fissured,  earthquake-prone site. A Geological Survey geologist was so certain of the  failure of any dam built there that he ended a memorandum with these  prophetic words: &quot;Since a flood could be anticipated, we might  consider a series of strategically-placed motion-picture cameras to  document the process.&quot;<br />June 5, 1976: The reservoir behind brand-new  Teton Dam is almost full. A seepage in the canyon wall began two days  before and now the dam itself is vomiting mud. A spring appears at yet  another seep, becomes a torrent and a whirlpool forms inside the dam. The  dam disintegrates and 80 billion gallons of pent-up water is released --  the second largest flood in North America since the last Ice Age. The  torrent continued all day until the huge reservoir was empty. The dam cost  $100 million. Damage downstream: about $2 billion.<br />PBS produced a  commendable video of this important book. The four-tape special, available  on Amazon's video site and at many libraries, is well worth watching. In  it, the author of this book speaks at length, impressively.<br />Chinatown,  the movie with stellar performances by Jack Nicholson and Faye Dunaway, is  based to some extent on events described in Cadillac Desert.	2000-07-08
US	52742526	R3QR9VWST6OZP7	1890862010	770604542	Live by the Sword: The Secret War Against Castro and the Death of JFK	Books	3	10	17	N	N	Definitely offers some new and worthwhile material	Eight years ago, thirty years after President Kennedy was shot down in Dallas, the Oliver Stone movie rendition of the assassination of JFK inspired the declassification of virtually all the files on the case.<br />Gus  Russo had already been involved in investigative reporting on the  assassination. This book is the result of his prior knowledge or beliefs,  and from his access to the new material. No doubt Russo had strong leanings  as a result of his prior involvement. Who wouldn't?<br />Over the years I  wavered between the conspiracy and the lone-gunman theories, never really  settling on either. Russo's arguments in this book are sufficiently  convincing that I believe Oswald could have killed Kennedy single-handed. I  must say I found a different Oswald in this book than the inept Marine  deserter I had envisioned all these years.<br />It is not all that important  to me now, however, who killed JFK or how. While Russo has me believing  that Oswald was the single assassin, I do not cringe from the certain  belief that a conspiracy could just as well have been employed, for there  are people in this country and inside the U.S. Government as capable of  pulling off a coup as usurpers regularly do all over the world.<br />What I  found interesting about this book, as I labored through its mountains of  irrevelance and redundant arguments, were the more human aspects of JFK. It  was no secret that JFK was a relentless womanizer, but I was unaware that  he was one so determined that he had what seemed to be incurable venereal  disease. Russo writes:<br />&quot;JFK suffered from severe and persistent  venereal disease -- gonorrhea, specifically. Long-rumored, this fact became  conclusive when the notes of JFK's physician, Dr. William Herbst, were made  available at the Kennedy Library in Boston in 1992 [following the gov't  mandated declassification of all files]. Those notes clearly reveal his  treatent of Kennedy's massive 'gonoccal infections.'<br />&quot;Herbstwas  originally called in 1950, after the renowned Lahey Clinic of Boston had  failed to halt Kennedy's VD infection. Not only did the clinic admit  failure, but so did Herbst, who treated Kennedy for ten years before  passing the baton to Dr. Janet Travell, the new President's personal  physician. The available medical record shows that Kennedy continued to  receive massive doses of penicillin (600,000 units at a time) throughout  his presidency.&quot;<br />Massive? Yes, 600,000-unit doses of penicillin are  massive. One tenth of that would cure a common case of  gonorrhea in a  patient who had no built-up resistance to penicillin.<br />The theme laid down  by the book's title, &quot;Live By the Sword&quot;, is that John and Robert  Kennedy were obsessed with ridding the world of Fidel Castro. Perhaps  Robert more than John, considering what we now know of the private social  demands on JFK. Both RFK and JFK were publicly humiliated by the  consequences of the incredibly reckless Bay of Pigs fiasco, yet still they  passionately pursued a vendetta against Castro. It was that vendetta, Russo  believes, that inspired Oswald to doggedly pursue his plans to assassinate  John F. Kennedy. Russo builds a quite reasonable argument that Oswald did  what he set out to do.<br />One thing is hardly arguable. The general belief  by official USA at the time was that Cuba was somehow accountable for JFK's  death -- perhaps justifiably so considering the endless attempts by RFK and  JFK to assassinate Castro -- and if a lid wasn't kept on the pot we could  find ourselves in WW III.<br />Russo builds a strong foundation for his  theory, one shared by many other credible researchers. This book is  significantly marred, however, by a large infustion of trivia that is not  needed to make the arguments advanced, and which in many cases is so easy  to disbelieve that it tends to undermine the rest of the book. For  instance, much space was given to intrigue surrounding Dallas's RedbirdAirport -- ingrigue that simply fizzled out after being thrashed from every  conceivable perspective. At one point in the detour Russo wites,  &quot;According to CIA documents released in 1977, two Cuban men (on the  night of JFK's murder) arrived at the Mexico City airport from Dallas, via  Tijuana, on a twin-engine aircraft.&quot;<br />A writer must avoid parroting  reports of virtually impossible occurrences, even if they came from the CIA  (maybe especially if they were CIA), and even if they were important to his  argument (in this case they were not) -- arguments must be founded on  credible matter. This material was injurious to Russo's narrative, not to  mention that it was an unnecessary diversion. Such a flight would have made  no sense even if it was possible. It is about 900 miles from Dallas to  Mexico City. Tijuana is 1200 miles in the wrong direction, and it is  another 1450 miles from Tijuana to MEX. A twin-engine plane of 1963 vintage  (like the 200 mph Beechcraft Baron I was sitting in at the Abilene arport  when the first reports of the shooting came over the ADF) could not have  departed from Dallas after Kennedy's murder and flown to Tijuana and arrive  in Mexico City before the next morning.<br />I got a world of new information  from Russo's book, but at an awful price. It was uphill all the way.	2000-06-10

It was amazing how he wised up along  with my growing up.<br />I was a corporate pilot when I first read &quot;Man  Against Himself&quot;. Karl Menninger's warning played itself out many  times before my eyes as some of my businessmen passengers warred against  themselves.<br />Want a deserved raise? Pick a day when the company stock just  jumped 10%, or a good earnings statement is issued. Or ...<br />Gritted teeth  and jutted jaws. Men against themselves stalk into the company president's  office knowing in advance he's on a tear, a rampage, and demand a raise at  the very WORST of moments. Sometimes they are fired. On other occasions  they are earmarked for replacement.

Forewarned by Menninger's advice, we can do  something about the phenomenon, pull a ripcord, don a life preserver, put  on a gas mask ...<br />Do you know a good friend who is destroying himself?

US	52742526	RL4GECAXH6IN0	039303626X	456555513	Patrick O'Brian: Critical Essays and a Bibliography	Books	5	25	26	N	N	Absolutely essential for the serious O'Brian reader	I have a hunch that it would take some doing to get these same contributors -- towering literary figures all -- together between any two other book covers. Their essays provide thoughtful insight into O'Brian's  writing. They allow me to better understand why I instinctively liked it  from the start.<br />In his opening paragraph of the introduction to this book  William Waldegrave says, and so aptly, &quot;Few events in the continuing  history of literature are as satisfying as those moments when a writer,  leaving behind the dissonance of experiment and imitation, finds his own  authentic voice and settles into a lifetime of creativity in a style which  he makes his own.&quot;<br />Patrick O'Brian's superb style is his alone, a  voice like no other, and when we go back to his earlier works -- having  exhausted the Aubrey/Maturin series over and over -- we find that he had  settled into his style long ago.<br />The final contribution sheds some light  on why O'Brian was so slow to take off in the U.S., which was not until  after he was translated into Japanese. Stuart Bennett's essay is titled  Four Decades of Reviews. &quot;Though rarely out of print in Great  Britain,&quot; he says, &quot;the first five of the Aubrey novels received  a somewhat muted reception in the U.S. After 'Desolation Island' in 1979,  no attempt was made to present Aubrey to an American readership until  Norton's 1990 reissues. Reasons for this long American dry spell can be  found in some of the reviews of the early Aubrey novels.&quot; Some  examples:<br />&quot;Publisher's Weekly&quot; said of &quot;Post Captain&quot;  in 1972: &quot;Overwritten for so little plot, which consists mainly of  adventures at sea and the friends's feuding over their rather tedious  women.&quot;<br />&quot;New York Times Book Review&quot; on &quot;H.M.S.  Surprise&quot; in 1973: &quot;Mr. O'Brian is constantly becalmed in his own  diction, which can take a disturbingly giddy turn. Men-of-war with names  like 'Belle Poulle' and 'Caca Fuego' just don't inspire confidence.&quot;  Mr. Bennett responds, &quot;The French quite certainly possessed a ship  called the 'Belle Poulle' ... Furthermore the Spaniards often named their  men-of-war 'Cacafuego'; one formed part of the Invincible Armada.&quot;<br />I  discovered &quot;Master and Commander&quot; and &quot;Post Captain&quot;  wholly by chance in 1990, before I or anyone I knew had ever heard of  Patrick O'Brian. The reviewers this second time around had not awakened. I  was hooked from the start and like a literary Johnny Appleseed began  introducing others to this fine &quot;new&quot; writer. And so it has been  a wonderfully satisfying experience for me to see the appreciation of  O'Brian's craftsmanship blossom, then swell to such heights as it has  during the years following. Happily, the reviewers liked Aubrey and Maturin  this time around.<br />I believe this collection of essays was the first of  the string of books that now accompany O'Brian's books. In it we learn some  things about Patrick O'Brian from himself. Among them: he wrote his first  tale of the sea, &quot;The Golden Ocean&quot;, &quot;in little more than a  month, laughing most of the time.&quot; He describes that the story,  published in 1956, made no great impression, but led an American publisher  to ask for an &quot;adult&quot; sea story. &quot;Master and Commander&quot;  was the result. It was published in the late sixties, but would not be  successful in the U.S. for another twenty-five years, this time at the  hands of another publisher: W.W. Norton. Many American readers are very  happy that Norton breathed new life into Aubrey and Maturin, and  consequently into Patrick O'Brian's whole works.	2000-05-13

The guestbook of the Quinta da Bacalhoa revealed that Elaine  Sanceau was a visitor at the very place some years before. Other tie-ins to  Prince Henry made the second read of Henry the Navigator more meaningful:  The Quinta da Bacalhoa was built by King Manuel in the 1500s. Manuel the  Fortunate, who dispatched Vasco da Gama on the voyage of discovery to  India, built the quinta for his mother. It later came to be owned by the  son of the first and greatest Portuguese governor of India, Afonso de  Albuquerque. The palacio was built on land that was a hunting preserve for  King John I, father of Henry the Navigator.<br />I have visited the remains of  Prince Henry's &quot;university&quot; at Sagres and gazed seaward from the  high cliffs overlooking the Atlantic, much as Prince Henry must have done a  thousand times, watching for the return of a ship, a ship that might or  might not return.<br />What settings could give a good work of history more  sparkle? Elaine Sanceau wrote a marvelous account of the life of Prince  Henry. Quite appropriately, it's a history of the reign of King John I, his  several sons, and their adventures and misadventures.<br />The tragic and  bloody consequences of the curious will left by John I, which resulted in  the assumption of rule by his second wife's son rather than one of his own  are described in chilling detail.<br />Sanceau's &quot;Henry the  Navigator&quot; isn't in print, but the book was popular in its day and is  not hard to locate on the used market. Well worth the effort, too.	2000-04-27

This time they are engaged in Jack's worst nightmare: a blockade, which is bad enough, but in this case Rear  Admiral Harte is second in command. Harte is a scrub to those under him  whom he doesn't especially dislike. But to Aubrey! Ugh.<br />But Jack gets a  respite from the tedium when ordered to escort the ship captained by his  old mid, now Commander William Babbington, on a mission that Harte hopes  will set Aubrey up for a fall.<br />We're at sea. Babbington is visiting  Captain Aubrey aboard the Worcester, his Dryad sailing along over there,  when we are treated to one of  tasty little morsels that O'Brian's sack is  so full of. Babbington and Aubrey are leaning on the Worcester's rail when  the quote begins:<br />The Worcester and the Dryad had hardly sunk the  squadron's topsails below the western horizon before the sun came out and  the breeze increased so that the sparkling blue was flecked with white  horses.<br />&quot;Buttons, the French call them,&quot; observed Captain  Aubrey in his thick, cold-ridden voice.<br />&quot;Do they indeed, sir,&quot;  said Captain Babbington. &quot;I never knew that. What a curious  notion.&quot;<br />&quot;Well, you could say that they are as much like sheep  as they are horses,&quot; said Jack, blowing his nose. &quot;But sheep  ain't poetical, whereas horses are.&quot;<br />&quot;Are they really, sir? I  was not aware.&quot;<br />&quot;Of course they are, William. Nothing more  poetical, except maybe doves. Pegasus, and so on. Think of the fellow in  the play that calls out 'My kingdom for a horse' -- it would not have been  poetry at all, had he said sheep.&quot;<br />In this episode Jack  re-encounters that dusky maid, Mercedes, a re-encounter that might have  been a reunion if Stephen had not made the most untimely and unwelcome  entrance to the Crown in his life. And it is Stephen's turn to issue the  call, &quot;Come brother. There is not a moment to lose. We must run to the  boat.&quot;<br />It ain't all poetical and dashed hopes, however. Fate  delivers to Jack his favorite ship, the Surprise. She takes on two ships in  as furious a little battle as you could ever wish to see. And wins, with  Bonden doing it the civil, tucking the vanquished Turk's swords under his  arm with savoir faire.	2000-04-04

Unlike some of the reviewers below me, at 9 I had no trouble at all comprehending Treasure Island or anything else Stevenson wrote.<br />Full-blown characters,  and what a passel of them. The story runs on from the start like a runaway  freight train. The duplicity of Squire Trelawney and Dr. Livesey versus the  cunning of Long John Silver made for excellent conflict. Captain Smollett  was the right kind of leavening.<br />And even after all his conniving and  treachery, Stevenson was able to give Silver a certain likeability -- I  wasn't unhappy to see him sail away, and neither was Jim Hawkins.<br />Of  course, even with all his initial innocence, Jim Hawkins came from just the  right mold, believably apprehensive and fearful when that was called for,  but able to rise to essential occasions.<br />This wonderful story was praised  more eloquently than I can by culzean7@cs.com below.<br />It's a pity that  school teachers still force-feed good stuff down the throats of kids today,  then turn them loose to plaster graffiti all over these review pages. With  all the Judy Blume lying around, why waste the likes of Stevenson and  Steinbeck and London on them?	2000-03-23

Dava Sobel, in her lean, crisp, yet penetrating style, captures the history of the development of that critical instrument -- the  chronograph for mariners. How many ships, how many lives were saved by this  one achievement? Dava told the story just right, in my opinion.<br />Not  surprisingly, John Harrison learned that there was political finagling to  contend with back then, as there is now. So his prize for solving the  problem of keeping accurate time on ships wasn't as forthcoming as it  should have been.<br />Fans of O'Brian's Aubrey/Maturin series will love  &quot;Longitude&quot;, and rejoice that the invention came along before  Aubrey and Maturin's voyages. Those two encountered enough slings and  arrows without having to wonder where in the world they were.<br />That old  saw that claims &quot;You can't tell a book . . .&quot;  is off the mark in  this case.

US	52742526	R11OLG0HUS2Z5S	039304016X	637283524	The Perfect Storm: A True Story of Men Against the Sea	Books	5	35	41	N	N	I give it five stars, and gladly	Once I stood on the bridge of a supertanker in port and -- looking way, way down at the sea below -- commented to the captain that we must be above any possible waves up here. &quot;I've seen this bridge awash,&quot; he  said. &quot;There's not a ship afloat that the sea can't  destroy.&quot;<br />&quot;The Perfect Storm&quot; brought that captain's words  back to life. Junger did a craftsmanlike job of tying together a string of  disasters laid at the feet of that storm, the Andrea Gail being only one of  them. There's no question she was destroyed, and Junger certainly had the  license to theorize how it might have happened.<br />The account of the rescue  helicopter's last flight was gripping, from takeoff through the long,  futile attempt to refuel to the decision to ditch while they still had  power -- a ditching under power being preferred to trying to autorotate  into an unseeable sea. The graphically described ditching itself, the  tenacious and courageous rescue efforts of the captain and crew of the  merchant ship that saved several of the helicopter's crew.<br />People  routinely engage in horifically hazardous activities, shrug their shoulders  and call them jobs -- that's the way they make their living. Several  examples were graphically brought out in &quot;The Perfect Storm.&quot;  When I read about ordinary people killed when everything goes to hell while  they're &quot;just doing their jobs,&quot; they get some thoughtful  sympathy from me. I really think about them and my thoughts return to them  from time to time. Junger gave me a number of decent, ordinary people whose  last minutes I could try to imagine, people I could really  appreciate.<br />Flying is second only to trains as the safest form of travel.  But I've sat at the controls of an Aero Commander in turbulence so severe  it seemed unlikely the ship could stay together. I got glimpses of the  little wrinkly corrugations that occur in the skin when the wings flex more  than they ought to,watched the prop spinners slamming around with shocking  force in the cowlings, wondering how much the engine mounts could take, or  the wings for that matter, wings that the heavy engines were torqueing so  severely. I watched holes appear where rivets once were -- you knew the the  airframe was weaker with the loss of every one. I was luckier than some of  Junger's subjects. Nine Eleven Charlie held together, even though she  suffered some awful structural damage.<br />I think I can come close to  appreciating some of the more gripping moments in &quot;The Perfect  Storm&quot;. Only close, though. I considered the book an excellent account  of a complex, many faceted drama in real life, for the most part a drama of  people doing their jobs, by God, right up to the bitter end. And so I think  about them.	2000-03-02

So if you want my opinion of it, just scroll down a short way. This 1999 update is well worth buying even if  you have the first one.<br />Of course, it embraces more titles of the series.  But King and cohorts have spent some worthy time enlarging what was already  there.<br />For just one example, the new edition has a biographical sketch of  Lord Cochrane, the real fighting captain that Aubrey is patterned after. It  was Cochrane, as captain of the little 16-gun Speedy, who captured the  36-gun Spanish ship that is the Cacafuego in the novel. Cochrane believed  that anything shocking, out of the ordinary, was a valuable battle  strategy. So he had his men blacken their faces and swarmed aboard the  superior ship screaming bloody murder, exactly as Aubrey did.<br />Cochrane,  like Aubrey, fell afoul of real-life jealousies and suffered the  considerable consequences. It seems that military commanders with blood and  guts run chills of jealousy up the spines of their more timid counterparts,  and so find themselves in hot water. A modern example is Gen. George Patton  -- he made too many other generals (Viscount Montgomery for one) appear  hung up on dead center while he blasted full-speed ahead.<br />The new version  of Harbors etc. bears a fine original cover painting by Geoff Hunt, who  illustrated all the covers of the O'Brian sea stories.<br />Aubrey/Maturin  fans who already have the 1966 version will find this a worthy addition.  Those who don't -- well, how are you to learn what o'clock it is, Mate?	2000-03-02

He died without one legitimate smear on his  character. Few mortals contributed to mankind in general and to their  country in particular a fraction as much as he. Much of what he did was at  his own expense and neither promised nor provided financial gain. His  opposition to war was based on sound reasoning: he foresaw a devastated  postwar western Europe, leaving Russia to plunder and usurp much of Europe  unopposed. His fears were realized, of course. And who knows how close  Russia may have come to igniting WW III?<br />Lindbergh's hope of negotiating  a peace with Germany proved to be unrealistic, but he could not have  suspected that Hitler was a madman, one who would condemn his own country  to ruin even after it was clearly defeated.<br />Scott Berg painted a  brilliant panoramic view of the man, of the times in which he lived, and of  the world he lived in. I will argue against the preposterous premise that  Lindbergh killed his son on the page for that scurrilous book, &quot;The  Crime of the Century: The Lindbergh Kidnapping Hoax&quot;, and only mention  it here because some readers below me expressed that belief. Some souls  can't coexist with greatness, can only find comfort in their own pitiful  existences by defiling greatness.<br />The value of truth is at an all-time  low and falling, and the blind who will not see are still very much with  us.	2000-02-28

US	52742526	R2MDK2UNQ9A0UO	0440504902	87472277	Four Screenplays: Studies in the American Screenplay	Books	5	37	42	N	N	A good second semester with Syd Field	There is a huge gulf between writing books and screenplays. Books must paint mental pictures, where movies ARE pictures, usually accompanied by dialog. &quot;Usually,&quot; I said, because I saw a fine feature movie in  Zurich once that had no dialog. Background sounds were there, and it wasn't  until halfway through that the absence of dialog dawned on me. The movie  was made for viewing by audiences of any language.<br />Field handles the  subject of screen writing visually. His book &quot;Screenplay&quot; was  immensely helpful to me, even if I did have to get darned serious with it  and plow through it several times. But, describing the elements of good  screen writing is, after all, much more complex than explaining in words  how to make a tasty stew.<br />The stew recipe could be followed by most  anybody and the result would likely be okay, but Field's subject is much  more complex and subjective. Nevertheless, anyone who pays attention and  will apply themselves can benefit from this book, and from  &quot;Screenplay&quot; as well.<br />Many readers of books on writing will  never write anything, but this one has a side benefit for those who sort of  want to write but won't: It's a movie-appreciation course, too. I saw  &quot;Thelma and Louise&quot; (one of the 4 studied here) years ago, liked  it, then left it alone. Working through Field's books over and over  required that I watch this fine movie again. Gosh, Susan and Geena, I  hardly even knew 'ya. Another once was not enough -- now I've seen  &quot;Thelma and Louise&quot; a dozen times and never tire of it. Not only  is it a splendid &quot;how-to&quot; on script writing, it's a wonderful  movie adventure.<br />Field preaches that we should enter scenes late and exit  early. That's demonstrated again and again in &quot;Thelma and  Louise&quot;. He stresses that, because movies are visual, don't insert  dialog when an expression or body language will do. After Thelma talks to  Darryl for the last time ever, it's evident that she has cut the cord with  him (about time, too). Up to now she hasn't agreed to go with Louise to  Mexico, but after answering Louise's question: &quot;So, what did Darryl  have to say,&quot; Thelma asks matter-of-factly, &quot;So when to we get to  goddam Mexico?&quot; Louise's response is a small, complacent smile. 'Nuff  said.<br />There's a lot here if you're serious about screenwriting. Thanks,  Syd. You've been a big, big help to me, and I appreciate it.	2000-01-29

I sometimes think I should ask the reviewers at Mr. Showbiz  what I should get high on before going to see what they consider a  masterpiece.<br />&quot;Screenplay&quot; was sent to me by a movie producer  who asked me to write a screenplay for a book I wrote. When I lamented that  I knew nothing about writing screenplays, he said the book he'd just read  proved to him I could write; all I needed was to understand some important  aspects of the screenplay vs. the book.<br />I've learned a lot from Syd  Field. &quot;Screenplay&quot; clearly showed me the visual aspects of film,  &quot;It's all about pictures,&quot; Field stresses over and over. If I  learned nothing else from him, how to put a screenplay into professional  format would make &quot;Screenplay&quot; worth the trip.<br />Sure, I had to  study the book, go back over it several times before I got this, or that.  But gosh, diving into writing screenplays isn't like a lesson in Microsoft  Windows -- click here, drag that over there.<br />There's a lot to learn, and  Syd Field offers a lot of guidance for the serious student. I don't care if  he's never written a screenplay. Some of the very best book editors wrote  nothing except editorial marks on others' works. The fabled Scribner's  editor of old, Max Perkins, who brought some of their best out of Scott  Fitzgerald, Hemingway, James Jones, Marjorie Kennan Rawlings, etc. etc.,  never wrote a book.<br />I'll say this: If you want to read a book on  screenplays and put it down with the feeling you're ready to roll, don't  bother with anybody's book on the subject. But if you really want to learn,  if you have the requisite creativity -- AND gritty energy -- you'll get  your money's worth from Syd Field's &quot;Screenplay.&quot;<br />Also, his  &quot;Four Screenplays&quot; has been very helpful to me.Field has a way  of reinforcing things by saying them a different way, in a different  setting. I really didn't get his advice to &quot;get into a scene late and  get out early&quot; until I read this book. And didn't he pick some  dandies? &quot;Thelma and Louise&quot; and &quot;The Silence of the  Lambs&quot; are the two I studied most diligently, and what a ride it's  been. Two great, great movies, to my mind, both demonstrating what Syd  Field repeatedy shows us are important elements of fine screenplays.<br />One  other thing, Field's coaching has put a tiny new edge on my writing skills  as regards books, too, a benefit he probably didn't expect a writer would  obtain.	2000-01-28

In short, A Sea of Words describes just about everything  in O'Brian's seafaring tales we're not likely to know.<br />What is this bark  that Stephen dispenses for certain ailments? Why, the bark of the Chinchona  tree -- it contains quinine, says A Sea of Words, while also describing the  many other medical terms he slings around.<br />Jack attempts several times to  give Stephen a grasp of the weather-gage, as it relates to ships in battle,  but never so clearly as Dean King's description, which includes both the  advantages of the weather- and lee-gages.<br />It's all here, and even if one  had the encyclopedias and all the other essential references needed, which  I seriously doubt would be found even in a big-city library, why go  shopping when one book will do?<br />For those sorely needed maps, get Harbors  &amp; High Seas by King and Hattendorf, and you're all set.	1999-12-28

Len Deighton is unknown to many readers of even truly good literature -- partly because he took his time to do a craftsmanlike  job and therefore didn't turn out a stream of quickies to keep himself  constantly on the shelves.<br />I'm a pilot with 11,000 hours of flight time,  some in fighters. I finished Goodbye Mickey Mouse convinced that Len  Deighton was a WWII fighter pilot. Only a pilot, I thought, could describe  to the satisfaction of another pilot the feel of the stick when a plane is  approaching a high-speed stall, the feedback a pilot gets when his plane is  damaged or a system has failed -- how he goes about trying to nurse the  crippled bird home, sometimes successful and sometimes not . . . Then I  read his explanation in the back of the book wherein he describes that he  read 200 odd books on the subject of flying fighter airplanes in order to  be able to write about it with credibility that satisfied  himself.<br />Goodbye Mickey Mouse begins with a scene that dislocates your  perception of how this story will conclude. At the very end he clears up  your misperception in the most moving and satisfying way.<br />This is a story  of real airmen, their distinctive personalities laid bare, buddies all, men  who must accept the loss of buddy after buddy, but who manage to have some  fun in the air and on the ground. There is real romance here, the kind  Deighton is noted for -- sensitive for the most part but hilarious at  times.<br />A fine read for discriminating readers, exciting, suspenseful, sad  and haunting . . .	1999-11-06

Jack Aubrey may be resigned to the perils of his profession, but Stephen must now be silently wondering if maybe he and Jack are the men who never  return.<br />Indeed, this story began two volumes ago, in &quot;Desolation  Island&quot;, where it looked like they might have &quot;copped it&quot; in  the horrible old Leopard.<br />Then the next story, The Fortune of War, begins  with the Leopard limping into a British port off the Malay Peninsula, where  after being treated handsomely they board the fast-sailing packet ship La  Fletch for England (at last) where Jack is to take command of a new  frigate.<br />But the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune say nay, for  their ship burns and sinks, leaving them on the open ocean in a ship's boat  whose sails had been stolen and sold by a corrupt boatswain. After many  brutal, parched, sunburned days in the lifeboat terror strikes once more  when a ship within hailing distance fails to see them and sails on.<br />As  they appear about to succumb to the elements, however, they are rescued by  HMS Java. Just as they are recovering from the debilitating ordeal in the  lifeboat, Java engages the American ship Constitution (it's the War of  1812), loses the battle, and Aubrey and Maturin find themselves prisoners  of war in Boston.<br />There they discover they are very special prisoners,  for Aubrey or Maturin -- or both -- are suspected of being more than a  captain and his ship's surgeon. They escape this peril by sailing a little  sloop out of Boston harbor into the open sea where they meet and are taken  aboard the blockading HMS Shannon. With them is the love of Stephen's life,  Diana Villiers, who was in Boston due to entirely credible circumstances,  and whose fervent desire to leave with them is equally credible.<br />The long  and perilous chain of events that lead us to this story seem to be behind  them. But they must endure one more sea battle -- the Shannon engages the  USS Chesapeake in a short but exceedingly bloody engagement (all true),  takes Chesapeake, and lands them in friendly Halifax.<br />Now comes the The  Surgeon's Mate, where it seems that Aubrey and Maturin and Diana will at  last reach England without further hair-raising adventures. Not so fast,  mate. Shortly into this fine, fine tale they board the packet Diligence for  England, but the Diligence is intercepted by two strangely determined  American privateers. It soon becomes evident that it is Aubrey and Maturin  -- and a person of no less importance to their pursuers, Diana -- that is  the prize sought, not the dispatch-carrying Diligence.<br />Like O'Brian is  known to do by those who read the fine print and between the lines, and do  with great cunning, here he throws us a nice bone to chew on. The first  schooner seen is a sleek, fast vessel, one that Captain Dalgleish is  familiar with. He lowers his telescope and tells Aubrey, &quot;Yes. She is  the Liberty; and I see Mr. Henry has given her a new coat of  paint.&quot;<br />Interesting indeed. Those who have explored the lives of the  Patriots know that the Patrick Henry who concluded his moving speech for  independence with the immortal words, &quot;Give me liberty of give me  death,&quot; owned a fast, sleek schooner named Liberty.<br />So now, six  points off the starboard bow of the Diligence is the American privateer  Liberty, commanded, coincidentally, by a &quot;Mr. Henry.&quot;<br />Like  icebergs, some of O'Brian's most pregnant stuff is tucked away from the  view of many readers. Its discovery is not necessary to fully enjoy the  story, but when we do find a gem the satisfaction is as pure as being let  in on a fine secret.<br />We recall that in the very first volume of this  wonderful series, Aubrey's ship Sophie took a much superior ship named the  Cacafuego. &quot;Caca fuego&quot; could be translated into a seemingly  vulgar phrase, which led a New York Times reviewer to prose disparagingly  about Master and Commander and ridiculeO'Brian's choice of ship names. But  it so happens that the Spanish had not one but two ships by that name.  Nothing is preposterous in an O'Brian tale. Patrick Henry died a dozen  years before the War of 1812, and O'Brian is not implying it was Patrick  Henry's Liberty that intercepted the Diligence -- he's just having fun and  permitting a few readers to get a double dip.	1999-10-31
US	52742526	R1MUXZAW80TNK8	0871136791	11590154	Cold Mountain	Books	1	10	17	N	N	This is another &quot;Royal Nonsuch&quot;	Royal Nonsuches are like 100-year floods: they come along pretty regular. Maybe I'd better explain. Down here along the Texas Gulf Coast some engineers (assisted by politicians) defined something called the  &quot;100-year flood zone.&quot; Its boundaries enclose property that can  be expected to be flooded every 100 years, on average - which implies to an  ordinary mind that they aren't likely to get flooded more often than that,  either.<br />So, if you came as an infant to live in a house in that zone that  had been flooded, say, 20 years ago, why you'd likely be eighty before it  ought to get flooded again - that's just reasonable to any ordinary  mind.<br />But the people that live in the 100-year flood zone get flooded out  every few years, time after time, so we have to figure that by the law of  averages and plain common sense there's one heck of a drought coming.  Already, just since that map came out, it would take a thousand-year  drought, at least, to balance out the excess.<br />You would think that scams  like &quot;The Royal Nonsuch&quot; would be as rare as 100-year floods  ought to be. The phenomenon was described in fine detail for us in  &quot;The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn&quot; (a true story, else it  couldn't have been Huck's authorized autobiography). Huck reported that  &quot;The Royal Nonsuch&quot; was a stage play written, produced, promoted  and acted out by the king and the duke. It opened to a packed house and,  says Huck, got off to a fine start (sort of like the first few paragraphs  of &quot;Cold Mountain&quot;). Live from the scene, here's Huck:<br />&quot;He  rolled up the curtain, and the next minute the king come a-prancing out on  all fours, naked; and he was painted all over, ring-streaked-and-striped,  all sorts of colors, as splendid as a rainbow. . . The people most killed  themselves laughing; and when the king got done capering, and capered off  behind the scenes, they roared and clapped and stormed and haw-hawed tillhe come back and done it again; and after that they make him do it another  time. Well, it would make a cow laugh to see the shines that old idiot  cut.<br />&quot;Then the duke he lets the curtain down, and bows to the  people, and says the great tragedy will be performed only two nights more .  . .<br />&quot;Twenty people sings out: 'What, is it over? Is that all?' The  duke says yes. Then there was a fine time. Everybody rose up mad and was  going for the stage and them tragedians. But a big fine-looking man jumps  up on a bench and shouts: 'Hold on! Just a word, gentlemen.' They stopped  to listen. 'We are mighty badly sold. But we don't want to be the laughing  stock of this whole town, I reckon . . . What we want, is to go out of here  quiet, and talk this show up, and sell the REST of the town! Then we'll all  be in the same boat. Ain't that sensible?' <br />&quot;'You bet it is! -- the  jedge is right!' everybody sings out. 'All right, then . . . Go along home,  and advise everybody to come and see the tragedy.'<br />&quot;Next day you  couldn't hear nothing around that town but how splendid that show was.  House was jammed again, that night, and we sold this crowd the same  way.<br />&quot;The third night the house was crammed again - and they warn't  new-comers, this time, but people that was at the show the other two  nights. I stood by the duke at the door, and I see that every man that went  in had his pockets bulging . . . and I see it warn't no perfumery neither,  not by a long sight. I smelt sickly eggs by the barrel, and rotten cabbages  and such things . . .&quot;<br />News didn't travel very fast in Huck's day,  so we can forgive him for marveling over the seeming originality of the  king and the duke. Gosh, over half a century before Huck wrote his diary,  James Fenimore Cooper had pulled off a similar hoax with &quot;The  Deerslayer,&quot; which is still playing, albeit taking its share of  pummeling by rotten eggs. Among the jedges promoting Cooper's productions  were professors of English literature at fancy colleges who touted them  as  being &quot;pure works of art&quot; and having &quot;an extraordinary  fullness of invention&quot; -- translation: bad science fiction passed off  as &quot;the craft of the woodsman, the tricks of the trapper.&quot; Real  woodsmen and real trappers have doubled up laughing at Cooper's inventive  fullness. <br />Legions of such scams have been pulled off before and after  Cooper, and between Huck's expose of &quot;The Royal Nonsuch&quot; and  &quot;Cold Mountain.&quot;<br />&quot;Cold Mountain&quot; is a preposterous  agglomeration of nonsense to find its way between two book covers. The  publicity that fueled &quot;Cold Mountain&quot; would have been studied  closely by the king and the duke for future application, if they could have  figured it out how it was created. The trouble is, how do its strategists  crow about it? You can't put an ad in Advertising Age headlined: &quot;We  made a phenomenal best-seller of a book that should never have seen  daylight.&quot;<br />Jedges talking up &quot;Cold Mountain&quot; have suckered  a lot of people, myself included. Wasn't that sensible? But out of the 752  readers contributing opinions about &quot;Cold Mountain&quot; on this site,  206 of us are here with our pockets bulging, and it ain't no perfumery  neither, not by a long sight.

His  austere nature and harsh ways of interacting with his wife and Jody  (especially Jody) were not uncommon during a time when grubbing a living  took every waking minute -- which is the timeline of this fine story. But  the conflict Steinbeck expertly wove into the story was a critical part of  it; it was not a bit contrived. We noted that Jody didn't hate his lot in  life as a consequence of stern discipline, the complete absence of tender  and caring outpourings from his father. Indeed, the discipline was present  when the father was not: Jody caught himself pointing his .22 rifle at a  forbidden target and reminded himself that ammunition would not be  forthcoming for yet another year if his father had been there to see that  act. Jody did, after all, have a .22 rifle -- a prior gift from his father,  one with enormous meaning and carrying with it indelible notions of  responsibility.<br />Billy Buck, a masterful Steinbeck stroke of  characterization, was the buffer that absorbed some of the abrasiveness  handed down by father to son, at other times dulling its cutting edge, and  at still others obliquely giving the boy a means of rationalizing over it  -- it isn't personal, Jody, just your father's way. It was clear that Jody  was well aware of the latter, too.<br />His inability to embrace the boy with  outward expressions of fatherly love was otherwise expressed by Carl in the  gift of the .22, even burdened as it was by a year of abstinence from using  it, and then by the gift of the red pony -- which also came with a price:  warnings of the consequences that would come if the pony interfered withJody's chores or school. Giving with one hand and threatening to take back  with the other was not an uncommon form of conditional generousity during  those tough times, and it's not to be despised now.<br />Carl's outspoken  intolerance of Jody's maternal grandfather's despondency over his  obsolescence was Steinbeck's means of revealing to us that Carl Tiflin did,  actually, have a thread of feelings down deep, demonstrated by his remorse  after discovering that Grandfather had overheard Carl trashing him and his  ideas of &quot;westering.&quot;<br />For all his faults, Carl Tiflin was an  honorable, responsible, hardworking man. Those are the recollections Jody  the man would have of his father, with never a thought of the qualities  other observers disliked.<br />Too many fathers today don't have the stuff for  stern discipline, or discipline to any degree, even though it's more  essential today than it was in Jody's time. So we have novels about wild  and courageously untameable teens despising and defying their parents,  fictional characters who are mirrors of too many of their contemporaries,  just as Jody was likely akin to many of his.<br />Maybe I earned a good  measure of empathy for Carl -- and for Jody's uncritical acceptance of his  stern ways. My own father, also a stern disciplinarian, was incapable of  showing affection. Once, on no particular occasion where a gift was called  for (and I got precious few when they were called for), he presented me  with a fine cap pistol, a top-of-the-line model that made me the envy of my  friends, few of whom were as poor as we were. But the presentation was made  with grave warnings that it might have to serve as my Christmas present,  admonitions against breaking it,leaving it out in the weather, and with a  mitigating &quot;reason&quot; for the gift: It was a tool with which I  could scare crows out of the maize field, blackbirds from the tomato  patch.<br />Somehow, even then, I saw through his gravity and appreciated,  truly appreciated, the cap pistol as an exceedingly generous gift. The  power of that gift and my gratitude for it, as unworthy as I was often  reminded that I was, is demonstrated by my vivid recollection of the act  over a half-century later.<br />Steinbeck would have failed miserably with a  story in which Carl Tiflin was an effusively loving father, eager to obtain  frequent hugs and insincere expressions of &quot;love&quot; from Jody. He  could have welcomed Grandfather into the Tiflin home with open arms. He  could have shown some realization that old Gitano at least had some use for  the equally useless ancient horse he soon planned to shoot (instead of his  rationalizing over the benefit of saving pasture grass). But what kind of  story would that have been? Not a Steinbeck, but a touchy-feely piece of  crap with a good shot at best-seller status today.<br />Obviously, many  contemporary readers don't like The Red Pony. But the vast majority of us  who appreciate literature do. A sure sign of the story's worth is that it's  still around after all these years. And it'll be around when most of what's  written today will be long forgotten.<br />Doug Briggs	1999-05-04

The diminishing market has, not surprisingly, just about dried up the development of talent. Back when the Saturday Evening Post, Sports Afield,  the Farm Quarterly, Colliers and so many other periodicals kept a roaring  fire under the genre we took swell short stories and short story writers  for granted -- they were all over the place.<br />Not a single name comes to  me from those bountiful years -- I have to go back to Poe and the old  master, Ambrose Bierce, to even throw out a couple of examples.<br />The  collection in No Comebacks was a welcome surprise, and I had to stumble  onto the volume purely by accident, not knowing that Forsyth had even  written short stories. He's got the talent for it, that's for sure.<br />Any  reader who appreciates good, crisp short stories will love every one of  these by Forsyth. But maybe the audience for them has ebbed, too.

A globe isn't nearly enough when you're sailing, fighting,  surviving and adventuring with Jack Aubrey and Stephen Maturin, and it  mattered not to me that King had to wait until there were sufficient  chapters in O'Brian's incredible series (one that I look upon as one great,  great book with 19 chapters) to form an adequate foundation for Harbors and  High Seas, for I read them over and over and King's guide makes the repeat  servings even more delightful.<br />Now as I travel the world in the O'Brian  series I know where I am and where I've been -- and often where I'm going.  The maps are outstanding (I always thought a map here and there in the  novels themselves was called for), and King's narrative takes me ashore in  places all over the aquatic world to round out my adventures with my  favorite literary characters.<br />The old pictures from The Naval Chronicle  are worthy -- and thoughtful -- additions to the whole fine work.<br />I guess  I'll be reading Aubrey/Maturin books forever, and with Harbors and High  Seas right at hand. Too bad the guide had to end with The Commodore but,  hey, I'm not complaining. I'm happy for what's here.<br />Thanks to King, too,  for his lexicon, A Sea of Words. That was the finishing touch for the  O'Brian addict that I am -- I want to KNOW what a studding sail is, a snow  (for I, like Maturin, thought a &quot;snow&quot; must be a white ship), the  mainchains (not &quot;chains&quot; at all), the messenger (definitely not a  means by which you might get a message to Garcia) . . .<br />A tip of the hat  and a warm thank you to Dean King and his cohorts: John B. Hattendorf, J.  Worth Estes, and mapmakers William Clipson and Adam Merton Cooper.<br />It is  truly wonderful that this incredible series of historical novels has  inspired these indispensible accompaniments. There isalso the volume  edited by A.E. Cunningham, &quot;Patrick O'Brian: Critical Essays and a  Bibliography&quot; which belongs on the shelf with every O'Brian fan's  collection. These books about O'Brian's books are a further testimony to  the greatness of them -- they stood tall on their own, it's only that  they're even more robust now.<br />Doug Briggs	1999-04-30

Bells and whistles have become an addiction for software developers, and it's high time someone finally turned a spotlight on this aspect of software &quot;development&quot; that has crippled many an otherwise good  program.<br />QuickBooks was once a nice little bookkeeping program for small  businesses. We used it for years, loved it, then upgraded to version 5.0.  Unfortunately our old version was out the window before we discovered what  a colossal mistake we'd made.<br />First, there's the &quot;User's  Guide&quot;: almost a thousand pages! A manual of such bulk is a tipoff  that a program is too complex for most mortals (assuming the text was  reasonably to the point).<br />Second, the addition of a multitude of new (and  useless, for us) functions so cluttered the functionality of QuickBooks  that we couldn't fathom how to use the functions that were once a breeze.  We never did figure out how to customize the &quot;new and improved&quot;  invoice template to accommodate our use.<br />Third: &quot;Features&quot;  would jump up and stand defiantly in our way. When trying to prepare  invoices using the barely acceptable template we'd be interrupted with an  error message that said we didn't have the item in stock -- we didn't want  to use QuickBooks for inventory control, but no, QuickBooks  insisted.<br />After trying to beat some use out of QuickBooks we unloaded it  and tossed it out. Now we use the invoice template that comes with MS Excel  (INVOICE.XLT)and it works just fine. Intuit actually did us a favor by  exercising their compulsion to ruin a simple program; they forced us to  discover that a totally functional little invoice template, one infinitely  customizable, was on our computer all the time. (Of course, the discovery  made us ask ourselves why we weren't heads-up enough to simply design our  own invoice using Excel in the first place!) It's easy to get carried away  searching for special-use utilities instead of using the tools already  right at hand to create our own -- free.<br />Grammatik is another disaster.  Once I considered it indispensable and proofed all my books on it to get  the reading level down and identify potential improvements in style. But  the folks at Grammatik couldn't leave it alone. New and useless features  were added which only bogged down the process of using it. A speller was  included(as if we didn't have spell-checking features in WordPerfect and  Word!), and if there was a way to disable Grammatik's spell check I never  found it. And what a sorry spell checker it was -- wouldn't allow you to  add words to its inadequate vocabulary, wouldn't allow you to ignore all  occurrences of words it didn't like, so it stopped on every usage of  them.<br />Where I once used Grammatik on entire books of, say, 200,000 words,  the new &quot;improved&quot; version would drive me mad trying to get  through a 5,000 word chapter. Out it went.<br />I considered Norton Utilities  indespensable for a decade. Now it's not loaded on a single machine here  because it pokes its nose into too many places where it has no business,  slinging DLLs around in reckless profusion, causing problems and lockups,  not to mention its insatiable appetite for computer resources.<br />If  Microsoft can't deliver a Windows version without bugs, how can  increasingly &quot;function-rich&quot; programs written by third parties  work under Windows without causing conflicts? They can't, and they  don't.<br />Cooper is on the mark: The inmates are running the asylum, and  they don't care what us mere users have to endure to accommodate their  passions for excess.<br />It was Mark Twain -- wasn't it? -- who apologized to  a friend for writing such a long letter by explaining, &quot;I didn't have  time to write a short one.&quot; Brevity is hard work.<br />We've solved many  problems here by brutally pruning the utilities on our machines, then  formatting hard drives to clear out all the DLLs and other files that have  beenleft behind. A typical gain in available hard-drive space is about a  third after a format and complete reload of programs and data  files.<br />Unfortunately, there are too many computer users who  &quot;think&quot; they want bigger and better programs even if they never  discover how to use more than their most basic features. Also, the computer  press fawns over &quot;feature rich&quot; programs -- the journalists  review them, but aren't saddled with using them every day. So vendors keep  bloating bloating programs and raising the prices.<br />I've hoped in vain  that some enterprising software writers would follow along behind the big  boys and create iterations of the simple, functional and easy-to-use  utilities they've discarded.<br />Maybe Cooper will inspire some to do just  that.<br />Doug Briggs	1999-04-27

It works, and I'm not going to a bloated and buggy newer version just because Microsoft needs a few more billion dollars. Besides, how many times am I expected to learn Windows? So I got this book that  advertises it has everything there is to know about the subject.<br />Alas,  whoever laid out and wrote the text for Peter Norton's Guide to Windows 95,  Peter Norton or John Mueller or, more likely, perhaps what would amount to  a committee, seems to have jotted down subjects that came to mind then  found chapters to plunk them into.<br />The hopeful user of this tome of over  a thousand pages is subjected to a collection of introductory sections:  Overview, Contents, Quick Reference (30 pages is &quot;quick?&quot;),  Acknowledgements, About the Author (&quot;Author&quot; is used singularly  and, interestingly, does not mention Peter Norton), Tell Us What You Think,  Introduction (11 pages of mind-spinning advice on how to use this unuseable  book). As awful as most computer books are, this one sets a new standard.  Any novice or intermediate user could learn every function of Windows 95 by  the time they learned how to beat the most elementary information out of  this book.<br />It's not a lot different from a maze game, where you're sent  hither and yon in search of the trail to the finish line -- this book has  many such labryithine trails, and most seem to lead nowhere. For instance:  Windows Explorer's File menu has a handy &quot;Send to&quot; choice which  comes out of the box with two choices -- 31/2-inch floppy and My Briefcase.  Of course, it seems reasonable that I could add other destinations (my Zip  drive, for instance), and in this Guide's index you'll find the entry  &quot;Send To -- page 40.&quot; On page 40 we're told:<br />&quot;Send To: Use  this special entry if you want to send the file or folder to a floppy drive  or other location. We'll see later that you can modify the destinations  listed in this entry to include just about anything you might  need.&quot;<br />Ha! Exactly what I want to do! But what's this &quot;We'll  see later?&quot; Why not now? A paragraph later I was encouraged to be  told, &quot;It's often handy to create additional destinations such as the  desktop, project folders, and network drives for this section of the  'context menu.'&quot; That statement sounds like the one before it, said in  different words. Now are we to discover HOW to create additional  destinations in the Send To menu? Nope. In spite of a laudable assurance in  the Quick Reference section of the book that &quot;Entries . . . are often  repeated both within and across topics for quick reference&quot;, seldom  will we find anything repeated where it would be most useful (which is  ALWAYS where we are reading about it at the time). Instead, we're  constantly sent on fishing expeditions elsewhere, even when the instruction  needed would consume only a few words. (In this case, by trial I found that  the Guide could have said simply: &quot;Drag the Zip-drive icon from My  Computer to the Send To folder in Windows Explorer.&quot;)<br />Here's the  next tidbit of useless information on the subject of adding destinations to  the Send To menu: &quot;Chapter 5 shows how you can use this feature to  make your desktop a friendlier place.&quot;<br />I found nothing about the  Send To menu in Chapter 5, the kind of frustrating dead-end encountered  repeatedly.<br />The index is next to useless. The index in any computer book  should reference and cross-reference; it should accommodate every search  term a user might imagine. But not this Guide to &quot;Everything You Want  to Know About Windows 95 -- In Plain English.&quot;<br />Struggling through  this $35-book for a year before I threw it away reminded me of IBM's  response to the Department of Justice's demand for documents during an old  antitrust proceeding (that fizzled out): Documents? You want documents? So  IBM sent several moving vans full of documents for the DOJ's lawyers to  scratch their heads over: Case dismissed.	1999-02-27

And that's going back through a lot of books! Everything in the world that should be in it is there. Old Black the horse was as wonderful as his master, Jim Bradley.<br />I loved the old black couple, the Jacksons, who lived on the lane to the Bradley's little weekend ranch, and was truly touched by the genuine friendship between that couple and the Bradley family. All of the characters in the story, and there are quite a few, come vividly to life. You never have to think back and ask yourself, &quot;Now just who is this walking on stage?&quot; You know every one of them as if you had known them a long time.<br />The chapters involving the visit of Jim's Aunt Hazel and Uncle Harry are precious. Aunt Hazel has Alzheimer's disease and Uncle Harry is allowing her condition to get to him. It took the intuitive therapeutic interaction of a boy with compassion for his ailing aunt to show Uncle Har! ry, by examples, how to mitigate her suffering, how to lift her spirits. There was hilarity galore in those chapters, much of it at Aunt Hazel's expense, but it was never once in bad taste.<br />The rescue of Sheriff Martinez in the woods by Jim and Old Black, which consumed several chapters, was an endless stream of excitement that continued to escalate right up to the very last page of chapter 24. It was a tough job for both the boy and his horse that almost proved to be impossible, but every bit of it was entirely credible.<br />Old Black is a beautiful piece of creative writing. The story moved. It had a start, a middle, and definitely an ending, an ending that swept along through several chapters in such a rewarding way for the reader. Briggs never takes the writer's easy way out of a single scene or event, but works his plot with fascinating detail and excellent execution. The story was a fine blend of happiness, sadness, tragedy, and humor. Every aspect of the ending was perf! ect -- all the little loose ends that had collected along t! he way were neatly tied up in the most satisfying ways one could imagine -- even better than I ever imagined.<br />Without giving away the REAL treat at the very end, I will say I loved the way the jealousy toward Jim by the boy on the flashy horse was disposed of. That scene was a magnificent stroke! Then there is a very nice vignette involving that same boy at the very end that had best be left for the joy of reading it first hand. At that last horse show in the Astroarena, I swear I could hear the bawling, cackli! ng, mooing, crowing, grunting . . . of the animals, I was aware of the constant announcements over the loudspeakers, I smelled every aroma of the place, saw and heard the hay carts buzzing around, felt the presence of the activity going on all about -- I was THERE!<br />Old Black is a fairly long book --387 pages of text -- but I flew through it way too fast to suit me. We should be able to give an extra star to special books for appearances. This one is a beauty, with a nice oil painting for the cover, a pretty full-color map of &quot;Old Black Territory&quot; on the front and back endpapers, and at least five dozen gorgeous illutrations, which is why I presume the book was printed on such fine paper.<br />When you buy Old Black, you may as well buy two and get it over with. You'll just HAVE to let certain friends read it, and you'll sure not want to part with your own special copy.<br />(This review was provided by the reader, who does not have a computer, to the publisher for sending on to amazon.com.)	1998-07-19

Of his small fleet, only  Anson's flagship survives to return to England loaded with gold and silver taken from a Spanish galleon. (Spain has every right to take great pride in its role of financing the Royal Navy for the good part of a century.)<br />One of the ships that began that fateful but historic voyage, the Wager, is driven by a fierce storm onto the rocky coast of Chile and wrecked. The Unknown Shore is the story of the travails of those who survived the disaster only to experience new tragedies, some of their own making, ashore. Only a few of those who made it ashore survive. Guided and otherwise given aid by natives, those few reach safety in Valparaiso, Chile.<br />As in all of O'Brian's remarkably well-written stories, his narrative of The Unknown Shore is rich, delightful, flawless. His attention to detai! ! l is splendid, and splendidly set down. The central characters in this book are a midshipman named Jack Byron and a surgeon's mate named Tobias Barrow. Barrow is totally inept with any of the demands of survival in the rough, but Byron provides him with the inspiration to persevere.<br />A fine story of depravation and wild adventure, told with O'Brian's top-notch craftsmanship. Jack Byron and Tobias Barrow are credible stand-ins for Jack Aubrey and Stephen Maturin, yet to come in O'Brian's much more famous Aubrey/Maturin sagas, fans of which will be delighted with this precursor to that 18-book series.	1998-07-16

The Yellow Admiral is as good as any of the previous 17 Aubrey/Maturin novels: as good as novels get. It has occurred to me, and not for the first time as I have read and reread the entire series and observed the whole cast of characters mature, that what we call the Aubrey/Maturin series is really one very long book with eighteen chapters.<br />One can read the Holmes/Watson books in any order; the characters never change, and I don't recall references by Doyle to previous events, such as those backwards glimpses O'Brian slyly slips to us steady fans from time to time that must sail right over the heads of hit-and-run readers.<br />With not a molecule of discredit to her genius intended, Agatha Christie's Hercule Poirot remained the same character through 25 stories, and I'm not aware of any maturation of Miss Jane Marple. Of course, Agatha Christie probably felt that her readers preferred the familiarity that the sameness of characters provided.<br />What gives me the feat tha! ! t The Yellow Admiral might be the final Aubrey/Maturin episode? Diana never once jumps the traces; Jack mends all his fences at home; Sir Joseph Blaine is very much back in control in his seemingly obscure but influential position with &quot;the Committee;&quot; and Stephen has lived through a volume without a crisis. Then, just as Jack Aubrey has gotten used to the idea of building the Chileans a navy, while on a little respite in Funchal, Madeira, with his family and almost everyone else dear to him, he receives an urgent dispatch from Lord Keith of the Admiralty, advising him that Napoleon has escaped from Elba. Writes Keith: &quot;You are to take all His Majesty's ships and vessels at present in Funchal under your command, hoisting your broad pennant in 'Pamone,' and . . . proceed without the loss of a moment to Gibraltar, there to block all exits from the Straits by any craft soever until further notice. And for so doing the enclosed order shall be your warrant.&quot;<br />A! ! t thebottom of Keith's letter was a handwritten note from ! dear, dear Queenie, an important figure in Jack's youth and during his career, now married to Lord Keith: &quot;Dearest Jack -- I am so happy for you -- love -- Queenie.&quot;<br />So the Chileans must develop their navy without the services of Captain Aubrey. And there will be no yellow admiral in the person of Lucky Jack Aubrey.<br />Thus, with this pristine conclusion, I fear that we have seen the last chapter in the adventures of Captain Jack Aubrey, Royal Navy, and his loyal friend and invaluable companion Stephen Maturin. But O'Brian will be writing, that's for sure. And if his next work is another splendid biograpy, a fine story on another subject, short stories, whatever he writes will be a thrill for me to read.	1998-07-16

Patrick O'Brian's fans who mope about hoping for still another Aubrey/Maturin masterpiece should read this, his first historical tale of the sea. An incredible adventure surrounding the true account of Commodore Anson's small fleet intent on circumnavigating the globe. Some of the most gut-wrenching tragedies imaginable are tempered with subtle humor and sidesplitting hilarity. The fleet is eventually reduced by the ravages of the sea to one ship, Anson's Centurion, but it returns to England laden to the gunnels with an incredible fortune wrested from a Spanish galleon.<br />You few million Aubrey/Maturin addicts out there will love this book as well as any of the seventeen in the Aubrey/Maturin series. You'll notice that his superb writing skill was wholly present then as now, treating us to every human emotion in his uniquely masterful style. I've heard him compared to Conrad in his ability to describe the terror of an ocean run amuck, ravaging those small ships,the desp! ! erate efforts of the mariners to save their ships -- and themselves, sometimes successful, sometimes not. But after going back to Conrad for a fresh look at his work, my opinion is that O'Brian excels him.<br />Following this brilliant work is The Unknown Shore, O'Brian's account of what might have happened to the survivors of one -- or was it two? -- ships in Anson's fleet that were wrecked during the voyage.<br />In The Golden Ocean, as in all of O'Brian's stories, the characters live and breathe, love and hate, are often courageous but sometimes are not, often behave as we would wish but occasionally veer off the straight and narrow. Above all, though, they are always true to their individual characters.<br />Readers who lament that they have read all his novels -- thereby feeling themselves left dashed on a lee shore -- might do as I do, keep reading them over and over. I promise there is more there in each book than can be gleaned in a single reading. I'm on my sixth pass through ! ! the Aubrey/Maturin series and loving every story anew.<br />Th! e Golden Ocean, like everything else from O'Brian's pen (yes, he writes with a pen) is an exquisite example of the true craft of writing.<br />I put no writer above him in craftsmanship. Writers wishing to sharpen their own skills would do well to carefully study O'Brian's work. I shamelessly admit to adopting as much as I can from his compact yet radiantly illustrative style.	1998-07-14
