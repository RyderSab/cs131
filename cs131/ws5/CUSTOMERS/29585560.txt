US	29585560	R99UKX0MHIDUZ	1555000630	271725943	Koyukon Athabascan Dictionary	Books	4	2	4	N	N	comment to the one below	I can't deny the truth of the review below, but this book didn't help me because it is too analytical.  Verbs are listed by the root, and since in Athabaskan one root may make many verbs, it's hard to find a form on those 3, 4 or maybe more pages of examples.  The grammar is also rather analytical than practical.  It is true there is a lot of great nonlinguistic information.  The dialect described is toneless.  BTW Jette was not a good phonetitian, a modern native speaker corrected his k into k, k', kk(=q), kk', g, gg.  This dictionary has the full correct pronunciation.	2003-06-22

Well, it's hard to say if you need all 3 or not.  The advantages here are that: 1. The New Edition is NOT out of date     2. Most books on ID are copied somehow from this one    3. It give the basic philosophy, so instead of unordered details you have a whole system, and if you understand it, when some things change you know how to change what you do	2003-06-22

I read it because of the movie, and the movie was better.  If you ask me, Thorp's &quot;Crow Killer&quot; is more concise and more realistic.  But if you are a West fan, guess you will want to read Fischer too.	2003-06-22

Well, I can't say much about the choice of vocabulary, but I bought Quebecois and not French, and I received something that differed from a short French dictionary only in some Canadianisms.  What about the pronunciation?  Please do correct me, but  isn't oi in Quebec waw, not wah/war.  What about palatalization of t (so that moitie is not mou-a-ti-e but rather mou-o-tsi).	2003-06-22

I am afraid the book doesn't teach you Tamil per se, but rather conversation and colloquiallisms.  Actually the transcription is a half way between transcription and transliteration.  The voicing and spirantisation are not marked (only k, not k or h or g), nasal vowels are marked.  The Tamil texts doesn't always correspond to transcription.	2003-06-22

It is basically a phrase book, but I also gives word-by-word translation, and so you know how the sentences are made.  Tapes are also useful.

Well, page six was blank, there waas nothing more to write.  This book will teach you forms of address, and its great for teaching pronunciation, but apart from that it just teaches conjugation and colors.

Well, I tried to compare the text and translation - it just won't work for Athabaskan, but the texts are interesting, there are pictures, biographies of the informants in English only, bilingual mythical texts, and bilingual stories taken from life.  Tone is marked.  The texts together are quite long, not just examples.  If you are interested in Northern Athabaskans, this book is worth reading.	2003-06-22

So, as a manual, it's pretty useless (in spite of what it say in the introduction); for comparative purposes - it doesn't need my recomendation; it is also an interesting early description of Native life and customs, as well as an interesting example of a 17th century language manual though rather hastily written.	2003-06-22

It's not dalai, is sound more like dahhleh (ai is open e).  So called u is a close o, u with umlaut much like oo (that's what it says, but why is ue given in transcription).

There are two descriptions intertwined: chronological narrative (ending with surprising developments in the big business of fur trading, those guys don't ride out into the sunset) and a description of various aspects of life in the West before settlement.  I guess there are some unverified stories in there (I always wondered why Indians would murder one white man, and let the other run for his life, and why, unlike Iroquouis, and much like Karl May's Indians, they didn't think there was more merit in killing a brave and skillful man who perhaps had killed many Indians previously), Mountain Men's braggings, but I am glad the author does mention those guys tendency toward exaggeration.	2003-06-22
