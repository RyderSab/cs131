Thus, Republicans are worried about fraud while the Democrats are worried about discrimination.<br /><br />President Bush won reelection in 2004 by a wider margin than was expected, allowing America to dodge the ballot fraud bullet one more time.<br /><br />Mr. Fund shows why we must push forward initiatives to reduce voter fraud and ensure the validity of our elections.<br /><br />Reviewer: Chuck DeVore is a Vice President at the Texas Public Policy Foundation.

Through it all, one comes away with the realization as to just how nearly run the whole enterprise was.  Rather than brilliant stratagems carried out by well-trained troops, Gen. Washington succeeds through humble perseverance and no small help from the hand of Providence.<br /><br />The most riveting section of the book details the battles in and around Long Island in the summer of 1776.  The American forces spent months digging elaborate defenses, only to realize after the fact that holding onto to Long Island would be impossible without command of the sea.  Completely outmaneuvered by his more experienced British counterpart, General Washington was defeated and forced to evacuate Long Island at night.  By daybreak, a large part of the force had not yet crossed.  Disaster was at hand.  Yet, precisely as the sun rose, a heavy fog descended over the crossing site, covering only what was needed and leaving all else in brilliant sunlight.  As the last soldier made it across, the fog broke; Washington's army lived to fight another day.<br /><br />A few years later, Napoleon might have said about the battle and Gen. Washington, &#34;I'd rather have my generals be lucky than good.&#34;  The Delegates to Congress thought otherwise, closing the Declaration of Independence with an appeal to the Divine, rather than luck, &#34;And for the support of this Declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes and our sacred Honor.&#34;  As Congress approved those words, a huge force of British and Hessians assembled at Staten Island.  Little did the signers of the Declaration know that their reliance on Providence would be almost immediately tested time after time and in manners that still seem today nothing short of miraculous.<br /><br />1776 is well researched. More importantly, it is delightfully told. Thank you, Mr. McCullough.<br /><br />Reviewer: Chuck DeVore is a Vice President at the Texas Public Policy Foundation.

Jaffa's promised sequel to his &#34;Crisis of the House Divided&#34;, written in 1958 to counter the prevailing but wrong headed notions of academics about the meaning of the Lincoln-Douglas debates.<br /><br />In &#34;Crisis&#34;, Professor Jaffa sets forth the basis of the argument that in 1858 served to deny Senator Douglas the Presidency in 1860 by taking from him any moral standing by focusing the nation to confront the issue of slavery.<br /><br />In &#34;Birth&#34;, we see Abraham Lincoln's philosophy arrayed against that of Alexander Stephens, Jefferson Davis and ultimately, John C. Calhoun.  We further see that Lincoln's belief that &#34;All men are created equal&#34; is the heir of Thomas Jefferson, John Locke, and Aristotle whereas Calhoun's theories rest uncertainly on Jean-Jacques Rousseau and are close cousins to Kant, Hegel, and Marx and the school of historical determinism and Darwinism.<br /><br />Professor Jaffa carefully explains the undergirding theory of the American experiment: that &#34;All men are created equal&#34; is the premise of the American Revolution and not just an empty slogan.  That this should be necessary is a sad commentary on the large numbers of political scientists who find more common ground with Karl Marx than with Thomas Jefferson.<br /><br />While &#34;Birth&#34; has a degree of redundancy with &#34;Crisis&#34;, this can easily be overlooked as one was written over 40 years after the other.<br /><br />Reviewer: Chuck DeVore is a Vice President at the Texas Public Policy Foundation.

Jaffa's \\"Crisis of the House Divided\\" is an extremely important book.  In it, he succeeds in turning back the revisionist historians of the mid-Twentieth Century who sought to devalue Abraham Lincoln's commitment to the proposition that \\"All men are created equal.\\"<br /><br />This tide of revisionism took two general forms; partisans for the South who placed the full blame on Mr. Lincoln for sparking the \\"War of Northern Aggression\\"; and modern historians, skeptical of any higher motives and virtues in statesmen of the past, who claimed that there were really no substantial policy differences between Mr. Lincoln and Senator Stephen A. Douglas.  If the latter class of historian could prove that Lincoln didn't really believe in freedom for slaves and that his rhetoric against slavery was irresponsible (knowing how it offended Southern sensibilities) while Douglas' \\"Popular Sovereignty\\" policy would have eventually led to the limitation and elimination of slavery, then Lincoln's legacy as President could be shown to be the largely accidental.<br /><br />Fortunately, Professor Jaffa's work demolishes the corrosive contentions of the revisionists, showing, beyond any doubt, that Mr. Lincoln believed America was founded on the principle of human equality as much as it was founded on the idea of democracy.  That democracy and equality were the twin pillars of the American Republic and were in tension was something Mr. Lincoln well understood while Judge Douglas honored only democracy.  Hence, Douglas' \\"Popular Sovereignty\\" led to the concept that the majority could decide slavery was not only legal, but also moral.  In opposition, Mr. Lincoln argued that a majority did not have the right to sanction the enslavement of other men, regardless of their alleged inferiority, because \\"All men are created equal.\\"<br /><br />Professor Jaffa shows that Mr. Lincoln built upon the Founders' thoughts in the Declaration of Independence and urged their maturation towards the ideal.  Lincoln saw how the Founders invoked passion, hatred and revenge in support of the cause of independence from Britain but how these passions were no longer adequate to the task of preserving the Union from the dangers of mobocracy or dictatorship - dangers made more immediate by the revolutionary birth of America and the tendency of unrestrained democracy to disdainful the rule of law.  Instead, Lincoln recommended virtuous reason to lift the United States up, to show the world that it was truly capable of lasting self-governance.  Of course, the cornerstone of this reason was the thinking through in the body politic, the practical consequences of the principle, \\"All men are created equal.\\"<br /><br />Professor Jaffa's book is a gift to America and the world.

The author's style is very easy to read and hold's the reader's interest well.  The work is heavily footnoted with primary and secondary sources.<br /><br />Most Americans, think of Ulysses S. Grant (if they think of him at all) as a good general who battered Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia into submission, then went on to become a mediocre President leading an inept and corrupt administration.  The author lays to rest these common misconceptions, showing Grant to be a dynamic wartime general and an honest, if naïve, President dedicated to civil rights, fairness, and a sound economic policy.<br /><br />Jean Edward Smith lays out his case for rethinking Grant's life from the very beginning, painting a portrait of a hard-luck man who never gave up his integrity and who learned the value of perseverance the hard way when every venture he touched turned into a money loser in the 1850s.<br /><br />As the Civil War engulfed the nation in 1861, Grant, a former Army Captain, tried to offer his services to the Illinois militia and almost did not get a commission in the ranks of the volunteers.<br /><br />Grant rose steadily through the ranks because he fought, confidently taking the war to the South and never shrinking from danger.<br /><br />As the Civil War came to an end at Appomattox, General Grant dealt generously with the defeated Rebels.  Radical Republicans and some of the press decried his leniency, preferring instead to see the Confederate leaders tried for treason and hung.  This spirit of forgiveness was a constant in Grant's life and would serve greatly in binding up the nation's wounds, especially in the aftermath of President Lincoln's assassination.<br /><br />If leading armies in combat seemed easy for Grant, then his adroit maneuvering between Washington's competing interests during the tumultuous years of Andrew Johnson were astounding.  During Johnson's term in office, Grant was General-in-Chief.  In this role, he commanded the Army during the initial phases of Reconstruction - a task that Johnson was determined to short circuit, making peace with the Southern white elite by sacrificing the newly freed slaves on the alter of political expediency.  Grant would have none of this and he labored mightily to prevent the South from sliding back as if the Civil War was never fought.<br /><br />As President, Grant tried to move Reconstruction forward again.  Black Americans voted at percentages higher in the elections of 1870 and 1872 than they would for the next 80 years.  Eventually, Southern white resistance and Northern apathy would force Grant to accept what he could, with a coalition of Democrats and liberal Republicans determined to paper over white repression and violence on blacks in the South.<br /><br />If Grant's bravely standing up for the rights of the freedmen in the South seems surprising to an American reader in the early 21st Century, then his polities towards the American Indians were even more so.  Grant, the ultimate man of war, sought to make peace with the American Indians.  His peace policies initially worked.  He even named a former Army subordinate and full-blooded American Indian to be the head of the Bureau of Indian Affairs.  Grant pushed through reforms at the Bureau of Indian Affairs, seeking to reduce the corruption that prevented relief from getting to the reservations by appointing Christian missionary organizations to replace political appointees.<br /><br />In both his policies regarding the civil rights of African Americans in the South and the treatment of American Indians, Grant displayed political courage and steadfastness.  It's sad we do not hear more of this side of Grant the President today.<br /><br />Reviewer: Chuck DeVore is a Vice President at the Texas Public Policy Foundation.

The description of this state visit includes a very illuminating passage showing Reagan's world view and why he so powerfully succeeded where many others had failed before him.  The following passage describes a dinner Reagan held for Soviet dissidents at Spaso House.<br /><br />&#34;...As the Reagans entered the room, the crowd erupted with cheers and stood up from the tables...<br /><br />&#34;This was no state dinner for dignitaries...  Instead, the roughly one hundred people crowded into the ballroom were considered little more than chattel by the Kremlin; but Reagan was about to give a grand party in their honor.<br /><br />&#34;These were Jewish refusniks, Pentecostals imprisoned for their faith, human rights activists, and freedom advocates.  Reagan had never met any of the people in the room, but they certainly knew him.<br /><br />&#34;In 1979, Reagan had advised that `a little less d&eacute;tente with the Politburo and more encouragement to the dissenters might be worth a lot of armored divisions' in the Cold War.  Now here he was to meet the armored division face-to-face.<br /><br />&#34;Reagan's clear moral denunciation of communism over the course of his presidency was by now legendary.  When he had given his `evil empire' speech in 1983, political prisoners had tapped on walls and talked through toilets to share what he had said with fellow inmates.  It had energized and emboldened them, and given them hope.  Now he wanted to bolster them face-to-face.<br /><br />&#34;He walked through the crowd, shaking hand and even embracing men and women whom he had applauded years before for their moral courage...<br /><br />&#34;As he spoke before the group, there was a slight quiver in his voice, `I came here hoping to do what I could to give you strength.  Yet I already know it is you who have strengthened me, you who have given me a message to carry back.  Coming here, being with you, looking into your faces, I have to believe the history of this troubled century will indeed be redeemed in the eyes of God and man, and that freedom will truly come for all.  For what injustice can withstand your strength?  And what can conquer your prayers?'&#34;<br /><br />When I completed this passage, my eyes misted up, thinking of how deeply Ronald Reagan believed in the cause of freedom and how steadfast he remained in the face of harsh and often derisive criticism from American liberals, academics, and the media.<br /><br />Schweizer said Reagan's favorite virtues were courage and character.  I see much of the same mettle in President George Bush as he steels himself for a long term fight every bit as serious as Reagan's life-long struggle against the evils of communism.<br /><br />&#34;Reagan's War&#34; reminds us how the self-appointed experts said we couldn't defeat the Soviet Union - that we needed to accommodate them.  In this alone, &#34;Reagan's War&#34; is worth reading today to show how courage and character can triumph over evil.<br /><br />Reviewer: Chuck DeVore is a Vice President at the Texas Public Policy Foundation.

My Pentagon boss sent me to the briefing which was delivered by Col. Boyd and at least one of his &#34;Acolytes.&#34;  About ten people attended.  At the time, I had no idea of Boyd's significance - the briefing did, however, make a lasting impression on me.  Its two most salient concepts were the now-famous O-O-D-A Loop and Boyd's &#34;To be or to do&#34; speech (a heavy concept for a 24-year-old political idealist).<br /><br />The book has three main thrusts: Boyd's theories (mostly on conflict); Boyd's battles against the Pentagon's acquisition system; and Boyd's personal life.<br /><br />That Colonel Boyd had an unusually keen insight into the nature of human conflict should not be in dispute.  His foremost contribution to art of war is a time-based view of warfare - the Observe Orient Decide Act (OODA) Loop.  This book provides the context for how the author of the OODA Loop created it and worked tirelessly to get it into the hands of those who would apply it - it does not (nor should it) go in to detail as to how to apply it in combat.<br /><br />The book discusses Boyd's other theories and how they came to be as well.  Boyd's first breakthrough was &#34;Energy-Maneuverability&#34; or E-M Theory - a theory that changed fighter aircraft design (and which has an interesting tangential relationship to the OODA Loop).  His most purely intellectual theory was &#34;Destruction and Creation,&#34; a theory that purports to explain the way individuals and groups think and process reality in order to &#34;improve their capacity for independent action.&#34;  This theory ambitiously attempts to tie together human behavior with the Second Law of Thermodynamics, Godel, Heisenberg, and Planck - heady stuff for a fighter pilot from Erie.<br /><br />Colonel Boyd's battles against the Pentagon's acquisition system - especially the U.S. Air Force and its F-15, F-16, F-111, and B-1 programs are a little more problematic.  It is here that Mr. Coram might have used a bit more perspective and a little more skepticism in questioning the motives of some of the &#34;Military Reform Caucus&#34; members (most of whom simply wanted to spend less money on the Pentagon because they did not see the Soviet Union as a threat worth defeating).<br /><br />U.S. weapons systems are indeed complex and very expensive.  We Americans have the luxury of trading capital for blood and we (and the parents of soldiers, sailors, pilots and Marines) are all too happy to spend heavily on the one to save on the other.  True, weapons systems are typically designed by committees, take too long to field, and often cost more than advertised - but can anyone dispute the technical supremacy of American arms the world over?<br /><br />Many of the acquisition problems cited in the book were caused by the Pentagon's early adaptation of computer technology before such technology became commercialized, reliable, and cheap.  Even so, can anyone dispute that one B-2 bomber dropping one 2,000-lb smart bomb to destroy one bridge is superior to using 100 B-52s in a raid dropping thousands of dumb bombs to accomplish the same military effect (while killing half of the adjacent city's population in the process)?<br /><br />In addition, Mr. Corum uses manipulates statistics to back up his claims.  At one point he cites the cost of the B-1bomber when cancelled by President Carter as $167 million a copy, then growing to $287 million when President Reagan restarted the program - never mind that inflation was clipping along at a ruinous double digit rate during that time, nor that the aircraft was significantly redesigned, nor that the total buy was less than planned before therefore providing a smaller base upon which to spread the non-recurring costs of the aircraft's development.  And, lastly, never mind that the B-1 was, in and of itself, a part of President Reagan's overall plan to defeat the Soviet Union - what was Reagan to do in 1981?  Order that more B-52s be built in order to preserve a leg of the nuclear triad?<br /><br />Finally, Mr. Corum covers Colonel Boyd's personal life - and an unhappy life it was.  Colonel Boyd's life was filled with conflict.  He was abusive of his family.  He was rude to non-believing colleagues and superiors.  In short, he was an eccentric.  As is often the case with such brilliant men, it would probably have been impossible to separate the good from the bad - with Colonel Boyd, we get the whole package - or, to paraphrase Boyd himself, the whole seven hour briefing or no briefing.<br /><br />On a more personal note, it was odd feeling to read a book that ties together the lives of people I've met, worked with and read about, people such as Colonel Boyd himself or retired Brigadier General Huba Wass de Czege, who, as the Assistant Division Commander (Maneuver) of the 1st Infantry Division, spent some crucial minutes in my armored battalion TOC one cold Ft.

His early books helped inspire a generation of Americans to military service after Vietnam, adding momentum to the tide that defeated the old Soviet Empire.  That said, Tom Clancy has probably been coasting on his considerable laurels for some time now.<br /><br />THE BEAR AND THE DRAGON is yet another installment in the long, downhill slide of Mr. Clancy's body of work.  The action scenes are fine, the plot twists are, for the most part, interesting, but the author's overbearing opinions are wearing thin and his geopolitics, military tactics, operational art, and logistical understanding could use serious updating - not to mention that the use of gratuitous obscenities has appeared to reach an all-time high (low) and seems out of place much of the time.<br /><br />Sadly, after having developed the Jack Ryan character, Mr. Clancy is obviously loath to leave him behind and create a new potential future.  As a result, we are stuck with Mr. Ryan's world.  It is a world where terrorists detonated a faulty atomic bomb during the Superbowl, a Japanese Kamikaze piloted a 747 into Capitol Hill during a joint session of Congress, killing most of the Members of Congress and the President (and showing the author's contempt for politicians), and where the United Islamic Republic (Iran and Iraq) tried to rule the world and failed.  As a result, we are so far down an alternate path of history that the Jack Ryan series has transcended the realm of the interesting &#34;what if?&#34; to mere fantasy.<br /><br />One must invest a huge amount of time to consume this monster book.  What caused me to finally read it was that the many readers of my own book, CHINA ATTACKS, pestered me into reading Clancy's thriller (which came out months after the release of my own more modest effort at chronicling a future Chinese assault on a neighbor).  In this regard, I consider this Clancy effort somewhat harmful (whereas his early efforts were helpful in improving the average person's understanding of the world).  Clancy does do a commendable job in alerting us to the danger of aggression by the PRC.  He fails in painting an accurate portrait of how the Chinese will seek to exploit our weaknesses while maximizing their strengths in any future conflict involving America.  In THE BEAR AND THE DRAGON, as in most other Clancy works, once America sets her mind to the task, the enemy falls like a house of cards - sadly, in real life, the enemy gets a vote on the outcome too.<br /><br />Reviewer: Chuck DeVore is a Vice President at the Texas Public Policy Foundation.

That being said, Mr. Sternberg is a class act - honest, forthright, devoted husband and father, military veteran, deep thinker, hard worker - and someone who embraces his faith, Judaism, with fullness of mind and heart.  The latter quality, of course, is what inspired Mr. Sternberg to labor away at writing his tome as a sort of lifetime rebuttal to many of his coreligionists - and what a treat for us all his effort is.<br /><br />Mr. Sternberg's central premise is that the Jewish people in America should not be political liberals because modern liberalism runs counter to the core of the traditional teachings of the faith (one can make a similar argument about Christianity - but in America, cultural Christians, i.e., the body of Christians who actively worship as well as those who don't, are split fairly evenly between political liberals and conservatives).  Further, that freedom is the most important requirement for the Jewish faith to flourish - specifically, freedom from large, all-powerful government.  The author's most poignant paragraph on the issue appears on page 187:<br /><br />&#34;Beyond all of this there must be the realization that socialism, and its twin liberalism, by granting more and more power to the state, by looking to the state to solve all of our social, economic, and even personal problems, in effect makes the state the &#34;God&#34; whom all should worship.  By elevating the state to this supreme position, socialism or liberalism by definition, does thereby demote the eternal and One God, to an inferior position.  In so doing these philosophies defy the Second Commandment, when God thundered to Moses and the Israelites on Mt. Sinai, `Thou shalt have no other gods before me.'&#34;<br /><br />This, then, sums up both the essentially spiritual nature of American liberalism while also explaining why liberals cannot be dissuaded from their beliefs with data and logic - for them, liberalism is faith - faith in a brighter tomorrow by applying raw government power in the service of theory.<br /><br />In explaining this, and in imploring his readers to personal spiritual renewal, Mr. Sternberg has done a service for people of all faiths who may think of politics as a route for the salvation of Mankind on Earth, not simply those who follow the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.<br /><br />Reviewer: Chuck DeVore is a Vice President at the Texas Public Policy Foundation.

It shows the reader how war shaped the American character as much as it made America itself.<br /><br />The book's flaws are numerous, however. Drawing only from secondary or tertiary sources, many parts of the book are filled with inaccuracies of names, dates, and small details. As serious history for the professional, this book is to be avoided.<br /><br />On the other hand, this book does do a great service in capturing the ethos of the American fighting spirit. Through countless engagements and battles, Leckie illuminates the individual commander or soldier.<br /><br />One particularly gruesome and poignant passage, while describing an officer of the Crown engaged in an important operation against the French in Canada in 1759, is illustrative of much of the rest of the book, &#34;Townshend... ... (had) a reputation for coolness under fire. Once, as he watched an attack, an exploding shell blew off the head of a German officer standing near him, splattering Townshend with gore. 'I never knew before,' Townshend murmured, calmly mopping his chest with a handkerchief, 'that Scheiger had so many brains.'&#34;<br /><br />Another, of Grant at Shiloh, shows war's hellish nature: &#34;That night the rain fell in torrents, aggravating the agony of the wounded and magnifying the ordeal of stretcher bearers and surgeons. General Grant made his headquarters under a tree a few hundred yards from the river. But the rain, the throbbing of his swollen ankle and the booming of the gunboats Tyler and Lexington firing down the length of the Confederate line made it impossible to sleep. So the general moved back to the shelter of a log house which had been taken as a hospital. Here, the cries of the wounded and of men undergoing amputation seemed to Grant 'more unendurable than encountering the enemy's fire,' and he returned to his tree in the rain.&#34;<br /><br />It is passages such as this (most less unsettling) that provide a glimpse into the random, destructive, and terrifying reality of war - and how a free people respond to it and bend it - impossibly bend it - to their will.<br /><br />Perhaps if the leaders of the ignorant legions of America-hating terrorists read this book before 9-11, they would have rethought their self-destructive path - realizing that Americans' love of peace should not be confused with a soft pacifism. Rather, once aroused, Americans make war with a ruthless efficiency that Caesar, Genghis Khan, and Napoleon combined failed to equal or ever even dreamed of equaling.<br /><br />It seems the American revolutionaries had it right back in 1776 with the &#34;Don't tread on me&#34; flag.

For them, any conservative is labeled immediately as a dangerous right-winger.  Liberals, however, are mainstream and are not identified as such because, to the media elites, liberals are unremarkable -- just folks like they are.<br /><br />Goldberg's book is important.

Soon, he is picked up by California's new governor, Ronald Reagan, who makes him director of finance.  His skill at his job attracts notice from President Nixon, who calls him to be the budgeter at OMB, then the Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare.  President Ford's defeat in 1976 brought him a few years of high-paid relief from public service at Bechtel.  Then, in 1981, President Reagan called him to service once again as the Secretary of Defense, a post he held longer (seven years) than any other SECDEF serving a single President.<br /><br />Throughout the book, one is struck by Mr. Weinberger's selfless dedication - something the reader comprehends without the author's directly saying so.  One hopes that, post 9-11, such dedication to public service will make a comeback.  In the meantime, Mr. Weinberger's autobiography will serve as a primer for those who want to make a difference and change the world.<br /><br />For me, it was an especially warm read as I had the honor of serving in the Office of the Secretary of Defense from 1986 through 1988.  During that time I met Mr. Weinberger once and participated in a few meetings in his office.  Even though his wife, Jane, was in ill health at that time, I found Mr. Weinberger to be friendly, humorous, and extremely focused and smart - all traits amply shown in his book, IN THE ARENA.<br /><br />Reviewer: Chuck DeVore is a Vice President at the Texas Public Policy Foundation.

It explores the reasons for the persistent misunderstanding by Americans of China's motives and methods of operation.<br /><br />The bottom line is fairly simple: if an expert criticizes China, they're denied access, if an expert praises China, they're given access.  Without access, how can an &#34;expert&#34; be expert?  Thus, the only &#34;credible&#34; China &#34;experts&#34; are those whom of whom the government in Beijing approves.<br /><br />Reviewer: Chuck DeVore is a Vice President at the Texas Public Policy Foundation.

The &#34;Tiananmen Papers&#34; is a rare window into the Communist Chinese decision making process.  Its fine detail (said to be three times longer in the Chinese language edition) yields unprecedented insights into the march of events that led to the bloody crushing of the Chinese democracy and anti-corruption movement of 1989.<br /><br />This book should cause every reader to wonder if the Chinese Communist Party can ever peacefully share or give up power - and, if it can't, what the future holds for China and the rest of Asia.<br /><br />I recommend &#34;The Tiananmen Papers&#34; to all those who really have a passion to study China - anyone else shouldn't bother as they'll never get past the first dozen pages.<br /><br />Reviewer: Chuck DeVore is a Vice President at the Texas Public Policy Foundation.

A U.S. infantry platoon goes out on a patrol (in support of a NATO peace enforcement mission) and, before you can say &#34;Follow Me&#34; the mission goes bad, very bad.<br /><br />Other than describing the use of LandWarrior technology (thermal sights mounted on a couple of the platoon's M-16s), GPS, and an anti-tank Javelin team, there's very little in this platoon's arsenal or tactics that a soldier from WWII, Korea or Vietnam would find out of place (the radios can't seem to work and the M2 Bradleys don't factor in as this is a dismounted patrol).  This revelation seems to be one of Coyle's main thrusts: that, regardless of the technology, the poor, overworked infantryman (or Marine) is still the basic combat arm that must occupy terrain, interact with civilians and the enemy, and ultimately, suffer the most.<br /><br />Within the context of the patrol and the obligatory combat and attendant privations, the story's other thrust is the personality struggle between the newly minted second lieutenant, a West Point grad, and the first lieutenant battalion staffer just along for the ride to ensure the new lieutenant doesn't screw up too bad.  This conflict rapidly rises to dominate the tale (several times I found myself alternating between unbelief that the author could have created so pigheaded a character as the new platoon leader and a simple desire to see the man fragged by the next page).<br /><br />Coyle hints a couple of times at a larger message, but passes the chance to comment seriously. Instead, this book is a basic tale of small unit warfare and how real people, flawed as they may be, have to carry out their nation's orders and fight its battles. The books makes a serviceable tale, but the author could have used his growing fame and established name to really hammer home a larger message -- for that, I give the book three stars -- good, but not good enough...<br /><br />Reviewer: Chuck DeVore is a Vice President at the Texas Public Policy Foundation.

Drawn from official U.S., French, British and German accounts of battles in the Great War and compiled in the 1930s by several U.S. Army officers, this book is a foundational must-read for any ground combat leader of any rank.<br /><br />That the book's lessons are still relevant some 85 years after the battles described in it took place shows how little the essence of land warfare has really changed.  Prevailing in war still comes down to meshing basic principles such as maneuver, fire, mass, simplicity, combined arms, morale, training, and, above all, leadership.<br /><br />While the machinery of war steadily progresses, policymakers and combat leaders alike need to remember a few simple lessons of war: personal leadership in the face of danger matters, the enemy gets a vote in the outcome, and you can't own the ground with anything but an infantryman (or a Marine).<br /><br />&#34;Infantry in Battle&#34; may only have two shortcomings for the modern reader: it was written during a time when people actually had time to read (and read more), and it lacks from a more robust combined arms discussion (tanks and air power) due, of course, to the very ancillary role these arms played in the Great War (WWI).  Even still, I highly recommend this book for any military officer and for those civilian historians interested in warfare.<br /><br />Reviewer: Chuck DeVore is a Vice President at the Texas Public Policy Foundation.

Sadly, American foreign policy vis a vis China did not adjust to the end of the Cold War -- and Beijing naturally took advantage of this.<br /><br />Gertz carefully chronicles how China has managed to buy or steal our most critical national security secrets.  He documents how China views missile and nuclear proliferation as a way to threaten the United States (the enemy of my enemy is my friend).  He sets out some sobering scenarios for Chinese aggression in Asia -- and even in our own backyard.<br /><br />No one should doubt the seriousness of the China threat after reading this book.  Clearly China will present as great a threat to our safety and freedom as did Nazi Germany or the Soviet Union.<br /><br />Reviewer: Chuck DeVore is a Vice President at the Texas Public Policy Foundation.

You see, General Haversham, 60, is on a mission to rescue his foolish goddaughter (a nubile 20-something)from the clutches of a nasty Irish screenwriter wanna-be (aptly named &#34;Stalker&#34;).  The catch is, she's in Los Angeles and might not want to be rescued while he's in London and hasn't a clue about what he's about to face in L.A.<br /><br />The ensuing chase seems to bring the Old Limey no closer to his quarry, but it does tell us a bit about the hedonism of L.A.'s underside (one wonders how the author did his research).  It also serves as a backdrop for countless humorous asides about America's stereotyped &#34;left coast&#34; as well as, unexpectedly, the U.K.'s Labour government and socialism in general.<br /><br />By the time the story comes to its dusty and chaotic conclusion one is left wondering two things: is the moral fiber of the heroes of the story any stronger than that of the villains (for their noble ends did certainly justify their ignoble means) and, when will &#34;The Old Limey&#34; be turned into a Hollywood movie?<br /><br />Reviewer: Chuck DeVore is a Vice President at the Texas Public Policy Foundation.

His strong  stand against the attempted Communist take over of Hollywood is a  little-known testimony to his moral courage and foresight.<br /><br />When you  finish the book, you really understand that he was the right leader at the  right time: he won the Cold War, restored pride and confidence to America,  and began the process of slowing the role of the Federal government in our  daily lives.

First, they believe that war with the United States is inevitable, as China's defense minister has recently stated. Second, they  believe that China can win such a war.  Third, they believe that by the  middle of the next century one country--a hegemon--will come to dominate  the world, and that this hegemon will be China.<br /><br />Hegemon, Steven Mosher's  new book on the China threat, makes it clear that China wants to organize  the world the way it has for 2,000 years.  It wants China as the center,  surrounded by kowtowing tributary states.  That is the very meaning of the  country's name in Chinese:  Zhongguo--the kingdom in the middle.  But  Mosher tells us that there is another name, even more revealing, that the  Chinese have for their country.  They call it Tianxia--all under heaven.  A  fitting name for a once and future hegemon, a manifest ruler of the  world.<br /><br />This is a must read for all those concerned about China's growing  stature in the world, and what America must do to forestall the China  threat, and promote human rights and democracy in that vast and powerful  country.<br /><br />Waiting until China attacks Taiwan will be too late.  America  needs to wake up to a new and chilling reality.<br /><br />Reviewer: Chuck DeVore is a Vice President at the Texas Public Policy Foundation.
