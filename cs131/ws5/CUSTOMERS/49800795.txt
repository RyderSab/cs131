Anyone with a casual interest in weather will find this book useful. <br /> <br />The book is printed on good quality stock and is full color throughout.  I wouldn't be suprised if this is used as a meteorology textbook.  It is reasonably priced so I encourage everyone who reads this review to strongly consider this book.	2005-09-07

If there was a real trial here, the evidence presented was strong, but there remains reasonable doubt to the verdict. <br /> <br />There is little question the author interviewed some of the most important minds in theology, but why was no strong counter opinion presented?  At times each interviewee was challenged to refute atheistic material, but none of the atheistic people mentioned were given a fair chance at presenting their views in total. <br /> <br />Another factor that seems missing is the issue of people and faith.  Christ represents life for many because of their faith, not because of strong physical evidence of his very existence.  I personally believe in the resurrection because of faith, I didn't need some former journalist to convince me that what I believed to be true really was true.  In fact no where in the book is faith really explored. <br /> <br />But this is still a god book to read for those who need validation of their beliefs.  The author asked good probing questions to which his resources prvided strong convincing answers.	2005-09-06

This is a very good analysis of the organization of the modern Bible and the changes its undergone in the past 2000 years.  Author Pelikan has organized a concise history book and a good overview of the various religious sects and how they've put their own spirtuality into book format. <br /> <br />Jews and Christians, specifically Protestants and Catholics, have argued theolgy for centuries only to agree to disagree on most major topics.  The western world has taken the process a step or two further when they translated the original scriptures into their own languages.  Guttenberg, the King James Version, American Standard, etc. have all attempted to become definitive translations.  Interestingly each succeeeded and failed at the same time.  Nearly every Bible translator sets out to do the best their abilities and knowledge will permit, but each must make important decisions on what and what not to include.  Since few people read Hebrew and Greek, translations are inevitable, and we all must learn to live with the results.  Modern technology has made nearly any Bible currently in print available, so read what suits you. <br /> <br />Pelikan treds a path through the variations not formally endorsing any specific one.  His knowledge of his topic and his writing style makes this a very good book that Biblical scholars on down to church librarians will want to include in their collections.  The book would have been helped had an index been included, but this is but a minor flaw in an otherwise very commendable effort.	2005-08-22

I didn't think it was a history of the Methodist church, but rather the movement itself.  The book really does not talk much to what attracted people to the basics of Wesley's philosophy but it does offer solid insight into how the movement spread across the globe. <br /> <br />The book might have been better served had it devoted some time to explaining Wesley's early efforts in Bristol and other industrialized cities.  It might also have spent time explaining the sense of community with the lower class people it so attracted.  Also missing is what attracted people in America to the faith.  Was it the message?  Was it the organization?  There had to be something that gave meteoric rise to the faith. <br /> <br />But enough of what the book didn't contain.  It tells the story of many important people who gave the faith its meaning and brought multitudes to the meetings.  The appeal to women, blacks, the dispossessed, all owes a debt to people like Francis Asbury, William Taylor, or the unsung itinerant preachers on horseback.  The faith traveled with soldiers of the British Empire to India, Austalia, Africa, and made inroads in Korea and to a degree in Latin America.  All of this was possible through religious zeal.  Other works have explored the growth of Methodism among American slaves (Eugene Genovesee's Roll, Jordan, Roll is a strong example), but Mr. Hempton takes the argument full circle.  Not only does he describe the growth, but also the decline.  A web page cites Methodism as having 14 million members in the United States, so decline does not necessarily mean extinction. <br /> <br />The book is paced well enough that it should hold the readers attention.  It tends to drag at times, but it is not overly long in the first place.  It has some good statistics in the Appendix for any who enjoy such data.  Methodist scholars and pastors will find many interesting tidbits in this book for sermons or other educational discussions.	2005-07-29

This Bible more than fills in any gaps in my understanding of scripture and enables me to make meaningful statements during class discussions.  Not only are the Bible books and verses explained, but there are several excurses that provide detailed information on specific topics. <br /> <br />As some of the other reviewers have mentioned, many of the notes do not follow modern conservative points of view.  I was not aware of this when I purchased the book, but I am comforted when reading the notes that those who wrote the notes take a more historical and intellectual approach.  Too many Sunday morning televangelists talk of the impending rapture without realizing the same message has been said since television first started broadcasting such programs.  I prefer information that is well grounded in research and based on consensus rather than coming from some off-the-cuff blowhard with a fancy made for television stage. <br /> <br />This Bible is well worth the money and can provide anyone with good insightful information.  The inclusion of the Apochrypha is an added plus, and I'll admit it was a main reason why I chose to purchase this book.  It has the basic set of maps in the back, and has good historical timelines to help keep all the different works in perspective.  Again, it may not be the Bible for everyone, but I am please with my purchase.	2005-07-25

The book covers very well modern, Western conflicts and personalities.  The US Civil War, World Wars One and Two, Western European warfare, and major conflicts from around the world are all accounted for.  What is lacking are some of the more unfamiliar conflicts such as biblical battles and African and Asian warfare from pre-Western contact.  These pro-Western biases do not detract greatly from the book, but do make an impact. <br /> <br />Otherwise the efforts in the book are outstanding.  A wide variety of scholars contributed and each knows their subject well.

It depicts the war in maps and seems to cover all the important aspects of the conflict.  The new edition boasts of 164 maps.  There are large-scale maps showing entire theatres, and small-scale maps depicting towns.  There is a strange map titled a \\"London Gun Barrage, 1917\\" that is difficult to decipher. <br /> <br />One flaw of the book is its failure to take advantage of modern printing technology.  Perhaps even in 1994 color reporductions were expensive, but the variety of shading and line drawings, all in monochrome, become monotonous and a bit irritating.  Maybe a Third Edition will amend this issue. <br /> <br />But the book tells the reader a lot of information that a serious student will appreciate.  I recommend this book.	2005-02-08

First of all I liked the book and I recommend it, but the layout is rather cumbersome at times.  For example, the chapters in Part II are perhaps the most well organized and concise, but the chapters of Parts III and IV are convoluted at best. <br /> <br />The book begins with a basic overview but then author David Stevenson quickly shows how global the war became.  I enjoyed his theories and conculsions, particularly how he illustrates that generals and statesmen did not want the war to end as if they were on a collective ego trip at the expense of the common soldier.  This trip lasted until Germany lost the will to continue in November, 1918.  I also liked Stevenson's conclusion regarding Austria, that it actually won all of its major objectives (with German help) by Spring, 1918, but then was shackled to the German war effort and subsequently lost more than it had won. <br /> <br />My problems with the book are 1.) it's length-it belabors many points ad nauseum, 2.) his post-war chapters do not do the subject equal justice compared to how much effort he put into the war years, and 3.) by the end of the book he loses sight of all participants but France, Untied States, and Great Britain, with a seemingly over abundance of British references.  He gets into historiography of the war but this doesn't seem to flow with his summary of the geopolitical landscape after Versailles.  He conveniently cuts off his historiography without offering critiques of his contemporaries (Herwig, Gilbert, Strachan, and Ferguson).  This is probably by design, but if he insisted on going down this path he would have served his purpose well to reflect on the recent (last 10 years) flurry of WWI studies. <br /> <br />Overall, this is a good book that any student of WWI should not overlook.  There is a good bit of new theories and revelations.  It just takes a long time to plow through it.	2005-02-08

No one prior, and no one since have come close to explaining the political ideology of the American Revolution and \\"Critical Period\\" so thoroughly.  Gordon Wood picks up where Bernard Bailyn (who shows how American colonial governments evolved)leaves off and provides keen insight into how our present government came to be. <br /> <br />Wood makes no apologies for his subject, he simply does a superb job of providing the reader with evidence from which conclusions can be drawn.  The Constitution is the culmination of the Revolution, but somehow it has allowed for our government to become the largest purveyor of entitlements the world has ever known.  One wonders how the Articles of Confederation could have done much worse.  Wood explains that Americans were freer under the Articles, but the politcos of the day saw an opportunity to grab a hold of the government and make people think they are actually a part of the decisions being made.  Somewhere along the line, the original purity of American democracy became perverted into the monstrous federal government we see today. <br /> <br />But it wasn't always this way.  Americans, according to Wood, saw themselves as the standard bearers for the English constitution once they saw how the English themselves had lost sight of their constitution's intent.  They fought the war and crafted individual governments.  Then along came the men of ambition who could not strive within the confines of a state government and needed something that would allow for greater achievement.  Imperium in imperio became the obective of the new federal government. <br /> <br />Wood's book is excellent.  This should be required reader for anyone serving in Congress (though most would not understand what Wood is saying and the rest would be too stupid to grasp the real meaning of how our government came to be and who it was meant to serve).  Somehow special interests spanning the political spectrum have come to be and most common Americans are forced to make decisions being informed mainly by the bombardement of political advertisements we see on television. <br /> <br />If one desires to understand what the American Revolution meant for our political system, this book is a must read.	2004-08-23

But what was radical 35-40 years ago is not necessarily still radical today. In Roots of the Modern American Empire, Williams attempts to illustrate how America's agricultural sector, rather than the industrial sector, was the driving force behind America's quest for empire in the late nineteenth century. His sources are deep as he quotes people nobody's ever heard of. He makes a strong point, and the reader walks away from the book convinced to a degree that Williams is correct.<br /><br /> But is his book really radical? Not really. He was at the University of Wisconsin when he wrote this book and many Wisconsin history department factors come to play. He fully supports the frontier thesis of his own PhD. mentor, Frederick Jackson Turner. Williams never doubts Turner's conclusions and seems to promote them at every opportunity. To Williams the frontier was the great &quot;safety valve&quot; that allowed Americans to continually move west in search of new land. In chosing agriculture as the emphasis in the book Williams is really restating the obvious. More Americans were employed in agriculture and agribusiness than any other sector in this time frame. It only makes sense that these groups coalesced into an empire-building force for new markets.<br /><br /> Williams overlooks some area. Co-ops are not mentioned and there are apparent contradictions when he discusses the south's antebellum political power then slides over to show how the eastern metropolis wielded power in American politics. He doesn't always transition smoothly.<br /><br /> Ironically, Williams' own PhD. student, Walter Lefeber, wrote a book on the same topic of American empire building and used a more generally accepted thesis of industrialism as the moving force. But Williams' depth of understanding of his subject resonates strong with the reader and one cannot help but agree with him that agriculture was the true source of income for most Americans and the politicians catered to this large voting bloc.d one cannot help but agree with him that agriculture was the true source of income for most Americans and the politicians catered to this large voting bloc.	2004-07-24

Sometimes they may not like an author or the book may have been contrary to the reviewer's political or religious beliefs, but the end result is nearly always a low rating for the book.  This review will break that trend.  I felt this book was among the stupidest I've read, but it made me think and the author obviously felt he was writing about something worthwhile.  He repeats himself so many times his book is about 40% longer than it needs to be.  It wasn't until the end that I discovered a list of all the theories presented in synopsis format.  Had I noticed this earlier, I could have ignored the rest of the book.    I cannot subscribe to end time prophecies and feel the inevitability of Armageddon, especially when presented in such a poorly written format, is not just around the corner.  Author John Walvoord certainly knows his Bible and he was an authority among his peers, but his theory is so full of holes he ultimately discredits himself over the course of 228 pages.  The key flaw is presented on page 23 where he writes that prophecies should not be adjusted to any situation, yet he does that without regard to his own warning throughout the book.  Some authors write that the folklore of the Middle East is the basis for many Biblical books, yet Walvoord never mentions any such connection.  He is content to proceed happily through his theories of Russia invading Israel, a Mediterranean Confederacy of ten nations (based on Daniel 7:8 which actually mentions an 11th nation but three of the original ten were pulled up by the roots 10+1-3=8, but Walvoord sticks with 10), a world dictator who brings a false peace (aren't all peaces false or temporary?), and the final Battle of Armageddon.  He insists all Christians will be removed from the earth prior to Christ's second coming, but what's the point of coming back to rule with Christ if we make it to heaven?    The author is consistentwith many mainstream churches who proclaim the Bible was written for modern times as well as ancient.  This is obvious because if the Bible were not presented in this manner no one would care what it says and it would join the ranks of millions of dusty history books.  Too many times Walvoord uses speculative words like \\"may\\" or \\"possibly\\" which leave the reader to consider \\"may not\\" or \\"possibly no\\" or any other open-ended contrary response.  It isn't all Walvoord's ignorance; he just doesn't have much concrete evidence to base his claims upon.  In court this is considered circumstantial evidence and while not inadmissible, it makes the case more difficult to prove.  He warns against an increase in belief in supernatural, mystical, and bizarre phenomena, but what is creationism?  Creationists discount evolutionists, but at least evolutionism has more concrete evidence (though evolutionism as a theory has many of its own flaws and problems).    Like I said, the theories presented are holes big enough for a semi truck to fit in, and I simply do not subscribe to the basic argument presented, but the book made me think.  For this reason alone I do not give this an all around bad review.  Ironically, Walvoord died prior to the second coming, as everyone else who's died to this point.  Perhaps answers to his questions were revealed to him in the hereafter.  Of course he may be right all along and people like me will find themselves scratching their head asking \\"how did that happen?\\"	2004-07-11

This is an excellent work that describes how global the war truly was and how it impacted its own generation as well as the next century to come.  Anyone interested in World War One should consider reading this work.<br />The book covers many topics and it is somewhat interesting to see the placement of relatively obscure theatres, Africa, the high seas, and the middle east placed early in the book.  Most other works relegate these areas to one combined chapter or footnotes to a larger picture.  But these show how the war affected the entire world and rightly deserve their own chapters.<br />What is most appealing about this book is how it refuses to lay total blame on Germany for the war.  Ever since Versailles, France, Britain, and to a lesser extent, the United States, have sought to blame Germany for everything the war caused.  In this respect, Strachan follows Holger Herwig's argument on his work covering Germany and Austria-Hungary's relationship.  Each power went to war with specific aims and all were legitimate in their own opinions.  By losing, Germany got the short end of the stick.  Of course Germany's harsh treaties with Russia and Romania were prophetic in that they were a preview of things to come at Versailles.<br />Strachan argues the Central Powers stood little chance of outright military victory (mainly because Germany had no serious allies to support them) and thus sought to weaken the Entente in any way possible.  Most belligerents assumed there would be a 1919 campaign and were somewhat surprised when the Central Powers ultimately imploded in October and November 1918.<br />The book is well-written and very readable.  It has many photographs but no maps.  His theory that the war contributed much to the 20th century is right on the mark.  I disagree when he says World War Two was not inevitable based on the Versailles Treaty, but that is how scholarship works.  He's not wrong, he just didn't offer enough evidence to convince me otherwise.  Strachan is attempting a three volume project on the war and this book is an overview.  Even he agrees the project may be ambitious as the first volume took fifteen years to complete.  But he makes up for it with this one-volume book that is among the most comprehensive on the market today.t wrong, he just didn't offer enough evidence to convince me otherwise.

America believes in self-determination and the right to develop its own brand of democracy.  Unfortunately, no other nation is afforded the luxury of self discovery.  Other nations must conform to America's vision of democracy or face the terror of America?s military might.  This, to Williams, is the tragedy.<br />Cuba is his first case.  America wanted Cuba to adhere to American visions which meant wealth for the sugar planters and their American backers.  When Cuba sought its own course and threw off a repressive regime, America objected.  The rift has existed ever since as no American administration will ever acknowledge Cuba's right to govern its own affairs so long as Castro is in power.<br />Williams then systematically follows the years from 1898 through 1961 and paints a similar picture.  It does not take the reader long to get the idea and carry the argument beyond Williams' parameters and show that everything from Grenada to Lebanon to Afghanistan to Iraq can be shown in the same light.  American puppet governments are not granting freedom and democracy to their constituents as much as they are part of a ruling class dominated by the business interests that exploit their workforce and deny requests for reform until the entire population is ripe for rebellion (remember the Shah of Iran).  One wonders if the Saudi government is the next great western ally to fall victim to a popular revolt of Muslim fundamentalists.<br />Williams is a master of detail and works his arguments creatively in an entertaining fashion.  Neoconservatives of today will have the same objections as their predecessors from the 1950s in acknowledging Williams as a valid author.  But Williams makes a strong case and if more people were exposed to his writing, our country might even find a way to avoid the same pitfalls.  A Saudi revolution would disrupt oil markets and jeopardize world economies.  Perhaps if some thought is put into policy such a scenario is avoidable and preventable.  If people are willing to give Williams a chance American foreign policy might eventually reflect a broader American vision rather than the interests of a few.	2004-06-07

Rather, I review it as one who admires the author based on a televised interview several years ago.  In this interview he was asked about his political affiliation.  He artfully dodged the question by claiming to be what he called a &quot;pragmatic rationalist&quot; someone who favored what made sense and opposed what did not.  I've always remembered that and have adopted the phrase myself on many occasions.<br />This book is dated but has withstood a test of time to a degree.  Galbraith writes of how stockholders do not really control major corporations and he is correct.  Power lays in the hands of the senior management, a power that is taken for granted nowadays and abused by the more unscrupulous senior managers.  The argument Galbraith puts forth, that the major corporations are the apex of our economic society, is solid though it does not take into account greed brought about by the degree of power senior management enjoys.  Many of Galbraith's examples are far more entertaining than his conclusions.  Had he redirected his evidence into something that informed rather than confused, my review would have been more positive.<br />There will be those who refuse to acknowledge the depth of Galbraith?s intellect, and the book is in serious need of updating, but all in all it is a worthwhile read.  Galbraith once said that the real value of economics is that it keeps economists employed.  There are at least a dozen other witticisms interlaced throughout this book, and for this reason alone, it deserves attention.  Other than that, the non-economist will probably find it rather disinteresting and dull.	2004-06-06

The author uses a fictional family on a fictional farm to weave a story that has a solid plot and believable characters.  Her purpose is to make history come alive and be interesting.<br />The main character, Lars, is a typical twelve year old boy with a natural laziness and disdain for history until he meets up with a spirit from the local area's past.  This ghost (\\"shade\\") relates a story of survival and the importance of making decisions which ultimately connects past and present.<br />This book is well-researched and well-written.  It is somewhat predeictable but is engrossing nevertheless.  If more authors would attempt to teach history through books like this, libraries could be filled with eager readers awaiting to learn of their own and their nation's past.  The book really has no \\"villain\\" as Eddie, the antagonist, is dealt with in a way that shows how family legends can become blurred over the years.  The fact that neither he nor his father were humiliated only adds to the charm of the book.	2004-05-30

This book is a follow up to his Austro-Prussian War and often uses that war as a backdrop for events a half a decade later.<br />The book is an indictment of French generalship that in many ways should have either won the war or at least battled Moltke?s forces to a bloody stalemate.  Prussia was not the military machine of perfect tactical execution myth would have us believe.  In fact both France and Prussia committed blunders during battles, but Prussia owed much of its early success to the accuracy of its artillery.  Bismarck and Moltke were willing to throw thousands of men to their deaths at the hand of the dreaded French Chassepot rifle, while French generals Bazaine and Bourbaki squandered every advantage through inactivity.<br />In a course of five weeks, German forces had routed every French army leaving Paris open for conquest.  But here is where France?s indecisiveness actually aided it.  With Napoleon III out of the way, there was no legitimate French government to negotiate a peace.  Prussia dispatched forces to the Loire Valley in attempts to defeat any French force in the field, which confounded Bismarck and strained the Prussian economy.<br />In the end Bismarck forced France to accept a humiliating peace that festered in French politicians hearts and minds for four decades.  Though this war represents the end of Bismarck?s use of conflict to realize his realpolitik, the impression on France had been made.  One cannot really understand the First World War without first understanding the Franco-Prussian War.<br />Wawro?s knowledge is incredibly detailed and his writing style is very readable, though casual ?history buffs? will probably not grasp the full comprehensiveness of this magnificent work.<br />If the book has a fault, perhaps it is the lack of coverage ofthe Paris Commune and the revolution of post-Second Empire France.  He gives this topic brief coverage, but the detail of which he described the road to war and the conflict itself is surprisingly missing.	2004-05-02

There are chapters on the environmental impact of chemicals, the economics of materials management, regulatory basics, etc.  Each is well written by an authority in the specific field.<br />While regulations are prone to legislative changes and presidential whims, there are certain guidelines that all types of industry and government must abide by and this book is an excellent starting point for those with questions.  This is a constatly changing field, so this book is doomed to be outdated, but the basic work is in place and future revisions should be able to withstand shifting patterns.<br />If your business has a reference library, this book will make a fine addition.

Those who judge just one small portion of it (who may or may not have medical degrees to support their opinions) do the work an injustice by focusing on the narrow instead of the entire range of the book.<br />This book is full of detail that the average person can comprehend.  At times the book does seem a bit rigid in that certain ailments can only occur in specific parts of the body.  Case in point, my wife was diagnosed with a ganglion cyst on her ankle, an uncommon location, but according to the book, such cysts are limited to the wrist.<br />But this does not detract from the overall usefullness of this book as a standard reference.  Of course, no book should be the sole source of medical evaluation and doctors must be consulted as the needs arise.	2004-02-12

Well maybe I?m more unfamiliar with the field than I thought, but I don?t recall any book on the subject for a very long time.  Wawo works to dispel myths regarding Prussian military efficiency and attribute Prussian?s victory in 1866 to the total ineptitude of Austria.<br />This is an important point, for by 1866 Austria was a great power in name only.  The polyglot empire of a dozen languages and little common cultural heritage struggled with its own vastness and its failure to develop an industrial base that would support a military.  Chapter by chapter, Wawro illustrates how unable Austria?s military commanders were (except when they faced the Italians, who were even less capable that themselves).<br />The book is not long, but at times Wawro belabors his point too much.  He always finds new ways to describe Austrian bungling, whether it be appointing the wrong field generals or naming the wholly inept Benedek as the overall military leader.  Prussia had its own detractors leading individual forces, but Moltke and Bismarck were fully capable as military/political leaders.  Their plans worked in spite of those given the task of carrying them out.<br />The Austro-Prussian War is an important work that really sets the stage for Warwo?s most recent work on the Franco-Prussian War, which, presumably, he will carry forth the same thesis and apply it to other nations and personnel.	2003-11-19

Others seemed forever cursed by their very existence.  Unfortunately for residents of Southeast Europe, the latter is much more the case than the former.  In his important work The Balkan Wars, Andre Gerolymatos illustrates how war and brutality have made life for Balkan residents as bleak as their geographical landscape.<br />Gerolymatos randomly moves between the recent past and distant history to show how little has changed in the psyche of Balkan soldiers.  Brutal murder and rape are not new concepts to the region.  Ethnic cleansing is not a new concept, and has been around since Christian and Muslim first fought over disputed territory.  Political upheaval through assassination, and suppression of nationalism through dehumanizing acts of violence, span the centuries in this war-torn region.  The Great Powers are in part responsible as their only interests in this part of Europe seem to be when geopolitics suits their needs.<br />Gerolymatos covers his subject well, though he may give too much credit to Austria-Hungary as a true world power, and he rarely fails to mention the role sex played in the material he covers.  He offers solid evidence of the role the Eastern Orthodox Church played in its unique position of dominance within a Muslim imperial capitol city.  Maps would have made the book more easily understood, but careful reading reveals the deep knowledge the author has of the subject.<br />This book is ready to take a prominent role in works on this subject, and offers some of the better details of the 1912-3 Balkan Wars that set the stage for World War One.	2003-11-04

The guide offers a brief overview of the park and then breaks down tours of the parks into length of miles and length of time.  It also offers advice on visiting the various parks (complete with rattlesnake warnings and backpack camping rules, etc.).  The book offers real life information and does not merely glorify the parks (though many of the photographs certainly does).  For instance, in describing the South Unit of Badlands it recommends bringing a USGS topographic map but warns people will still probably get lost (not a pleasant thought, if you've ever been there before).<br />This is a handy book that most people will be able to use.  There are side trips to other sites listed after the main park is described.  It is more than a coffeetable conversation piece but is still fun to peruse when cabin fever strikes.	2003-05-20

Its characters are believable, the story well crafted, and the entire reading experience a joy.  Stoker's grasp of medical technology would make most modern physicians cringe (blood transfusions without verifying blood type, etc.) but who cares?  This book is worthy of reading more than once.<br />Dracula is the epitome of gothic horror yet it is not \\"spooky\\" and really doesn't cause nightmares in the reader.  The book may not have the reputation of the film versions, but it is far superior to any Hollywood version.  There simply is too much happening for any film to completely portray in two hours.  The book is a classic good-versus-evil and reflects a Victorian view of faith and sexuality.  Some on-line reader's guides are available to help give perspective on the book, but are not necessarily required.<br />All told, I rank this book high, I have only a few other works of fiction I rate higher.	2003-04-14

This book is a collection of essays on and about Minnesota and its citizens.  Some are rather light-hearted as they detail our recreation and geographic space, while others are more intellectually-based in our religion and politics.  Each is very well written and leave one with a better understanding of who and what we are.<br />The book is a bit out dated as it speaks of Jesse Ventura in the present tense, but it still is recent enough that many of the programs and ideals described are still around.  Unfortunately, our new governor seems bent on gutting our state government in the name of fiscal reform, but things like the &quot;Minnesota Miracle&quot; and our ethnic heritage remain.  <br />Again, if you life in California or New Jersey, this may not be relavant, but Minnesotans should strongly consider it.	2003-03-10

There is historical background, and, in the case of the section on Lewis and Clark, background on the major players, and good information of what to expect and what to see along the trail route itself.  This book is more than just a travelogue, it allows the reader to delve into the trail's past on a personal level.

He was corrupt and made money in ivory on the side from his \\"official\\" company business, but really was unable to use it for anything.

He opens by stating summer is over then proceeds to tell a tale of growing up and making decisions of one particular summer.  In the end, the book becomes its own forty-seven page assignment (and then some) as described in the early chapters.  Hassler weaves an intricate tale using metaphors along the way.  Particularly poignant is the main characters inability to use a manual transmission on a car.  Hassler writes how he often gets stuck in one gear due to unfamiliarity with a clutch.  This is a metaphor for his character's inablity to change gears in his life.  He insists on working in a grocery store, and plans to do so forever (so it seems), or how he cannot turn in his friend whose become a burglar.<br />The is a very well-thought and developed story line.  It is an older work by an accomplished author, but is worth reading nonetheless.  It is a middle school level book, and should be part of many schools' required reading lists.	2003-01-26

He first develops biographical sketches into the background of the five men he feels made the most significant contributions to imperialist doctrines then uses the second part of the book to develop his theory. The result is a readable, engaging work that represents an important contribution to American diplomatic history.<br />But Zimmermann also uses his book as a partial mirror to the present day. In 1898, America badgered Spain into a war the Spanish could not win. The reader cannot help but notice strong parallels to the approach America is using towards Iraq in 2003. Zimmermann?s quote about how American?s see themselves as liberators but are seen as oppressors by those they conquer echoes of America?s relationship with Pakistan today. His final twenty or so pages carry the work in sketch form to the present and helps portray his interpretation of the situation of America as an imperialist power.<br />Zimmermann?s work is well crafted, but there are questions about who he includes and who he only give limited space. After their biographical chapters, John Hay and Elihu Root, and to a lesser extent Alfred Mahan, receive only limited attention. The main players are Henry Cabot Lodge and Theodore Roosevelt. William McKinley and Woodrow Wilson receive mention in the latter part, but are omitted in the first. More detailed chapters on them may have helped the transition that occurred in 1920 where overt imperialism was set aside in Harding's \\"Return to Normalcy\\"  (whatever that means) campaign. Also there is no mention of Roosevelt as a progressive Republican that reached across class lines to achieve great popularity.<br />All things being equal, this is a very good book and Zimmermann has established himself as a powerful force in this time period. His title seems a bit unusual, as one may confuse it with something on the American Revolution or the Constitution, but it is a quote borrowed from Roosevelt on his way to Cuba with the Rough Riders.	2003-01-13

Anyone interested in the state ought to consider this book.  It offers solid accounts of early French and British explorers and carries the tale through the American period.  The work spans four volumes.<br />However, there are serious flaws as well.  First, the books were written in the 1920s.  This means there are many words that would be considered politcally incorrect.  &quot;Savages&quot; and &quot;heathens&quot; are often used without prejudice in reference to American Indians.  Second, the book bogs down in what the author must have thought to be pertinent information on early governmental administration.  Unfortunately the text becomes so tedious that it is difficult to continue reading.  Finally is the age of the work.  There is no mention of the Great Depression and post World War Two troubles because they hadn't happened yet.  These particular editions were revised in the 1950s but no attempt was made to bring the story forward.<br />As said this remains the definitive work on Minnesota history, but what it really begs is for the next historian to come along and redo the entire effort.	2002-12-31

Ely states in the introduction how he wants to avoid stating a thesis (which seems to be a typical lawyer's ploy to avoid committment) but then establishes themes to support his case.<br />Ely challenges popular myth that railroads literally carried the courts and the lawmakers in their back pockets.  The image of 19th century railroads taking land from people and getting all the laws and court decisions in their favor is simply not true.  Ely demonstrates how some railroads won court cases while others lost.  At times labor or the travelling public won cases while in others railroad interests prevailed.  There is no set pattern of cases where one side prevailed over the other.  Rates for freight are but one of Ely's examples.  Another was railroad mergers and the application of antitrust laws.<br />This book is not for the casual reader.  It is in-depth and at times kind of boring.  But legal historians will enjoy the large number of Supreme Court cases referenced and how the author analyses each.  I chose this book because I enjoy reading about both topics, railroads and law.  Others in this same boat will likely find much offered here.	2002-10-12

Ivanhoe  is a fast-paced, well-crafted tale in which the reader is also educated on medievalism, though it is not necessarily the author's intent.  Oddly, the title character receives only about fifty pages of coverage, while the remainder of the book is dedicated to the many colorful characters that make this story so compelling.<br />Scott blends history with fiction and occassionally makes some gaffes, but by and large his blending is successful.  At one point he has one character explainhow his grandfather had fought at Hastings (1066).  Since the time frame of this novel is circa 1197, it is nigh impossible, especially given life expectancies of the age, that a grandfather had been living 130 years prior.  He also stereotypes Jews as moneylenders and lovers of naught but profit, as if he has little understanding of Judiaism.  Finally, cotts ending is very fast-paced, almost too fast.  The reader comes away with a sense that he really wanted to get the book finished.<br />This particular edition has an introduction and conclusion by a Nancy Springer.  She puts the book into context claiming the real hero of the story is Richard the Lion Heart and the real heroine is the Jewess, Rebecca.  Scotts writing certainly gives Springer's conclusion credibility, but one could go further and say that the real heroes of the book is integrity and honor.<br />This was my first exposure to Sir Walter Scott, and I'm not going to say I've become a fan.  But the story remains worth reading as it fills in a gap between the two films \\"The Lion in Winter\\" and Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves.\\"	2002-09-05

Some of his conclusions border on prophetic \\"without a God, the capitalist is simply a pirate and markets collapse for want of a minimal trust between buyers and sellers\\" (take that Bernie Ebbers) while others are a bit more far-fetched Sir Francis \\"Drake was more than a pirate because of the immense scale of his theft.\\" But overall he keeps persoanl bias in check (or at least disguises them within the context of his writing).<br />Because of the breadth of his scope, he has little space for details in several instances, particularly when dealing with English colonies, but Taylor's intent is to cover more in quantity rather than quality. He neglects to mention the first Pilgrims had originally settled in Leyden, Holland prior to Plymouth. He makes little distinction between Plymouth and Massachusetts Bay. He also tends to endorse rather than challenge existing myths on the Puritan work ethic.<br />His most impotant contributions, even in their brevity, are those chapters peratining to France and Spain, and to a lesser degree Russia, for so little of what occurred with these colonizers has become common knowledge to the majority of Americans. In thses days of renewed patriotic vigor, it remains important to know that our national heritage expands well beyond what we received from Great Britain.<br />Taylor's overall effort remains excellent and I would hope schools and universities across the country adopt this book, particularly since it's now in paperback, into their curriculum.	2002-08-24

Similar to other Oxford companions it is cross-referenced and attempts to be usable to both the legal community as well as ordinary people.<br />The bookk is centered upon themes in law (common law, constitutional law, environmental  law, etc. rather than specific cases, which makes it a bit cumbersome until the reader learns what the book is really meant to provide.  If one is looking for specific Supreme Court cases then the companion to the Supreme Court should be consulted.  But the point is that other books are out there for specific case histories.  This book attempts to pull legal issues together into a single point of reference.  True legal scholars will likely feel this book is too brief on specifics, but the lay reader will find it useful in putting perspective on common legal questions of the present.	2002-08-22

Small towns and cities have most if not all of their streets depicted, and this map picks up where state highway maps leave off.  As a lifelong Minnesota resident, I was always impressed with the detail of our official state highway map, until I started driving some of the many small county roads, particularly in the western portions of the state.  I soon learned that many, but certainly not all roads are on the official map.  <br />The Delorme atlas fills the gap.  I've yet to drive a road that is not on this map, and for this reason alone, it will accompany me on any future journies.  This map also includes drainage ditches, landing strips, water treatment centers, and many other useful features.  This makes it useful to public works departments or other government agencies who might need to know such locations.<br />The oveall size (it's the same size as Rand McNally atlases) allows it to fit beneath a car seat, and it is organized with a quick reference map-index on the back cover.  A complete gazateer in inside.  These atlases are essential for any traveler.	2002-08-22

All types of life are covered, albeit in very brief introductions.  Plants and animals (microscopic to mammals to birds) each receive tertiary coverage.  The book does not get into specifics on how wetlands function relation to other ecosystems, and such coverage would have been useful, but the overall emphasis is still relevant.<br />The book is likely not intended to be read from cover to cover, as it is a field guide.  Field guides are really meant to be brought along in a pocket for easy reference when making field identifications.  In this respect, I am a big fan of other field guides in the series.<br />This volume and its companions should be readily available at nature centers, but the price is low enough for people to purchase it for their own libraries.  What it lacks in detail it makes up for in compactness and readability.	2002-08-22

George Kennan remains, though, more of a sage than one who can offer practical foreign policy advice.  His knowledge of US-Soviet relations remains nearly unparalleled, but it is not really that important any longer.<br />Kennan writes and speaks with pragmatism, though one does not have to read far into the book to know that he is warning of what he feared would be a US-Soviet military clash if the war hawks of the Reagan administration had their way.  Time and again he elaborates on how the Soviet Union is (was) not the enemy.  He feared that somehow the seeds he first planted as containment of a political philosophy would spell doom in the military arena.<br />This book is a collection of speeches, editorials, book reviews, and other public appearances that focuses on the late 1980s and early 1990s.  Kennan is nearly a century old, and if the reader goes between the lines one gets the image of a wise old man attempting to spread his message of peace to a world that doesn't seem to hear.<br />Kennan remains one of the most remarkable figures of the twentieth century.  Unfortunately, we no longer live in that time.	2002-07-04

This book is richly illustrated and has several good maps to help aid the book's presentation.  However, if not for the many illustrations and maps, the book might barely be half as long as it is.  Black does not really challenge the reader with new theories, in fact this is essentially a continuation of theories set for in his earlier work, European Warfare, 1660-1815.<br />Many of Black's arguments are continuations of earlier studies and this does affect the overall effectiveness of the present work.  He dazzles the reader with his knowledge of obscure (are largely insignificant) conflicts, particularly those between Europeans and natives from the new worlds, but this does not necessarily make his case.  He flits between battles and opponents much the way a warbler flits between branches in a tree.  He is always moving, but is not always going anywhere.  He randomly expands his cases into the nineteenth century when it suits him to do so, and this further confuses the reader.<br />But Black is not pretentious about his objectives.  They are relatively contained to discussions on technology's role in warfare and a variety of locations achieving basically the same types of accomplishments.  He rarely strays from this theory, but since he already did this in European Warfare 1660-1815, it is largely irrelevant or at least redundant.<br />Yet his knowledge is impressive and the reader should come away with knowing a bit more than before they started the book.  Given this, and the fact that this effort is much more readable than European Warfare, it is worth a look.	2002-05-31

The illustrations are usually accurate enough to make quick identification.  There are times, though, that this is not the case.  Recently I had a difficult time identifying a particular bird because what I saw versus what was drawn and the accompanying map were not all in total alignment.<br />However, this book is still far and away the best field guide I've come across.  It is easy to use, organized into logical sections, and is as complete as most birdes would ever need.  Some of the technical descriptions are cumbersome, namely trying to describe sounds with words, but this is not a major problem.<br />This guide should remain the standard for years to come.  The reader just needs to be aware that varaitions may likely occur in what they see on paper compared to what they see in the field.	2002-05-13

It covers the major themes of the Bible with detailed analysis and relevant sidebars so that anyone in a Bible study group or reading the Bible on their own can have a meaningful source of interpreatations.  Each page is a new subject, which makes it simple to use.  Pages can be read on their own or the entire book can be read.  Bible verses are quoted on each topic so the reader is always aware of how the idea is being applied.<br />This work is less than 300 pages, but it is so rich in detail that one will not be able to skim through it in a couple of evenings.  Once you start reading, it is hard to put down and is hard to not read every word on every page.  This book helps one gain perspective and context.  At the end is a summary of each book, including the apochrypha.  In the main text, non-canonical books like the Gospel of Thomas are mentioned, so the reader can rest assured the author put as much scope and thought into this work as was practical.<br />Bible scholars, Bible study groups, general knowledge seekers, historians, philosphers, and many others will find this book extremely useful and user-friendly.  Anyone disappointed in this wonderful volume is just not interested in learning.	2002-05-09

These two theologians debate the heart of Luther's fundamental differences over church doctrine.  Never mind issues like indulgences and purgatory (indeed Luther thanks Erasmus for not discussing such &quot;trifles&quot;) because Luther's primary argument concerned justification by faith through the grace of God.  The book compiled here, edited by Ernst Winter, is a glimpse into the minds of these two influential men.<br />Winter's editing is a bit suspect, as Erasmus enjoys the first 94 pages while Luther receives only the final 44, but this really gives Erasmus more time to make a fool of himself.  Erasmus wonders around raising many points and attempts to connect all into his free will argument, but it is not until his conclusion that he begins to make his point.  In section 48, Erasmus confuses free will with grace, on page 56 he refers to a chamber pot to make his point.  He makes a weak argument until his conclusion, which takes on the appearance of a lawyer closing his case.  Ultimately though, one must consider this: Rotterdam has never been known for its scholars; Erasmus is no exception.<br />But this is not to say Luther is the &quot;winner&quot; here.  The book is somewhat akin to a pre-Reformation version of &quot;Grumpy Old Men.&quot;  The debate gets personal at times.  In two instances Luther refers to Erasmus as &quot;stupid&quot; and  Erasmus states Luther is &quot;without reason.&quot;  This makes for a more interesting read but also shows the limits of each man's patience.  This book may not be for everyone, but those desiring to know more about the debate of the Catholic Church will find it has much to offer.  THere clearly are two different styles here.  Erasmus offers hope for all, true to the elements of Humanism, while Luther's effort is not for the faintof heart.  Either way, the reader will be richer for the effort.	2002-04-18

He does not follow a strict chronological path (though there is more or less a sequence of events) but once the reader gets accustomed, it flows pretty well. Smith makes clever use of colloquialisms (\\"skedaddled\\" \\"smashed\\"-meaning drunk, and \\"skulduggery\\" are but a few) which helps make the reader feel comfortable. Finally he states his thesis on page 140 (barely 1/10 of the way through the massive book) of viewing history as a part of a larger whole.<br />Smith often extols the virtues of socialism as the great counterbalance of industrial capitalism, which since this is a \\"people's history\\" makes some sense. He has the ability to enter the shoies of those he writes of, an admirable trait in a historian. However, at times he gets carried away with the socialist undercurrents, sometimes to the point of annoyance. He does give great leaders like Theodore Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson their just dues, and comes down hard on stupid leaders like William Howard Taft and Warren Harding, and this gives the book balance. Unfortunately by giving lengthy accounts of the doings of Big Bill Haywood and Emma Goldman Smith seems to elevate these people to the unwarranted level of greatness as well. The Roosevelt-Wilson rivalry is the most dominant political theme in the book.  Smith admires them both, Roosevelt for his populism, Wilson for his vision, and he covers each objectively and fair.<br />Smith never cites his sources so it is difficult to verify, but the reader learns to trust Smith as an authority on his subject. He makes an un-stated advocation of how committees served the country well in winning World War One, then attempts to illustrate how the Soviet Union emerged as a model of efficiency (\\"soviet\\" is defined as a governmental council). He makes great progress in some chapters then takes one step back with his unwavering advocacy of the socialist state. He seems to fall victim to his own conclusion on page 642 that \\"obsessions make bad politics\\".<br />But Smith is able to recognize genius when he sees it. Wilson's vision was the apex of the Progressive Era. When the unqualified Harding assumed the presidency, Smith ends his historical narrative. It is clear to Smith that Harding did not represent \\"progress\\" (one could conclude Harding didn't represent anything). The final several chapters are dedicated to technology, arts, education, and religion. He covers the American scene. Racism, bigotry, women's rights, philanthropy, mainstream and side stream politics, war, peace, industry, and many other themes are all handled with equal care by this prolific, intelligent author. His conclusion is well supported and his mastery of English would impress any wordsmith.	2002-04-04

It is gripping, a book I had a difficult time setting down.  Roberts had a style that was unique in that the reader can many times feel the sensations he is describing.  When the soldiers were hungy and were failing at hunting, Roberts could create a sensation of hunger and frustration.  When he described the streets of London, the reader feels like he/she is actually there.<br />This book is wonderful. It's full of lively, intelligent characters and solid story plots.  It is as good a represtation of colonial America as was ever done in the form of a novel.  Hopefully it will remain a timeless classic forever.	2002-04-01

Roberts writes of young Wiswell as he faced the struggle of a world he did not wish to see changed.  Wiswell was a Loyalist and suffered much for his beliefs.  Too many novelists (and indeed some historians) write off the tribulations of the Loyalists because of so-called &quot;patriotism.&quot;  But patriotism is not so clearly defined.  Wiswell believed he was acting out of patriotism when he made the desicions he did.<br />This book is another offering from a writer who can literally place the reader into the pages of his book and keep you there until the last page.  The characters of the several books are cross-referenced enough so one gets the impression of a larger historical community.  This allows Roberts to maintain continuity yet keeps him from writing in a historical vacuum.  The reader will follow Wiswell's journey from New England to the southern colonies and ultimately beyond the borders of the United States.<br />With any luck, this and the rest of Roberts' books will never go out of print.	2002-04-01

Each distillery is given a brief history and overview which helps the reader understand the many brands better.  Within the text of each distillery are the many varieties that have been produced over the many years, which ultimately means the Scotch connoisseur will likely never run out of opportunities to sample something new.<br />The rating system for sweetness and peatiness is a bit confusing, especially since the author specifically attempts to stay away from subjective numbers.  The availability rating is somewhat less misleading, though the reader must keep in mind this catagory is limited to the United Kingdom.  Americans will have an even more difficult time in finding many of these brands.  <br />Aside from question on the ratings, there seem to be few brands of Scotch (or Irish) single malts that are not covered.

Because it is so easy to read, this make for a good Bible for elementary level Sunday School teachers.  Teachers can have their students read and discuss scripture without having to do on the spot translations.<br />But this Bible is not just for youngsters.  Adults can gain new insight into Biblical lessons in ways that other Bibles fail to deliver.  There are many \\"mini articles\\" that provide unique perspective and there are introductions to each book that helps place it in proper context.  It is interesting to note that Barabbas is described as a well known \\"terrorist\\" as if to add new emphasis on his release from condemnation.  The side notes and cross references are also very useful.<br />All of these many components make this Bible a valuable resource for anyone interested in learning Christian scripture.	2002-03-19

Taylor's The Struggle for Mastery in Europe suffers from in being nearly fifty years old, it more than makes up for in style.  It is a riveting book that is smattered with wit and an author's thorough knowledge of his subject.  Alternate titles might have been The Struggle to Prevent the Mastery of Europe, or the Decline and Fall of the Balance of Power.  <br />Taylor's unyielding faith in diplomacy reflects a Cold War notion that any political problem can be solved by maintaining a diplomatic balance.  He deftly navigates the Byzantine web of diplomatic intrigue to show how negotiations, not war, ultimately resolves crises.  His whig interpretations are at times blatant.  Conservative Russia and Prussia are often &quot;humiliated&quot; and &quot;old fashioned&quot; while liberal France fell victim to its own &quot;ingenuity&quot; or suffered &quot;shattered prestige.&quot;<br />Not all events are treated equal.  The 1867 Anschloss or the 1894 Dreyfus Affair receive practically no attention, while obscure diplomatic conventions receive detailed analysis.  Great leaders like Napoleon III or Bismarck receive Taylor's praise while British statesmen of lesser stature receive criticism.  Taylor is also anti-imperial, stating that colonies are a sign of weakness (though he later seems to suggest the opposite).  His treatment of the coming of World War One is perhaps his greatest weakness, or perhaps this is where the book is most dated.  He seems to be somewhat surprised that war erupted in the face of diplomatic failure.  He fails to see that many at the time lost faith in diplomacy and allowed the war to happen.<br />In the end, though, this is a fine work.  Taylor interjects personal philosophies throughout the book.  &quot;Men learn from their mistakes how to make new ones (p. 111);&quot; &quot;Once men imagine a danger they soon turn it into a reality (p. 450); and &quot;A historian should never deal in speculations about what did not happen&quot; (p. 513) are but a few examples.  (This last is a personal favorite as it flies in the face of alternative history.)  Clever recto page headings and use of dates keep the reader aware of what is happening, and Taylor is a master of the semi colon.  All in all this remains a very informative work.	2002-03-09

The first part is a series of essays ranging from ancient art to architecture to modern art and is meant for the serious art history student.  The essays are detailed to the point that beginners may have a difficult time digesting and retaining the information.  The second part is the encyclopedic section with many entries ranging from artists to styles to subjects and beyond.  It is here the novice will find relevant information, albiet brief, on most topics a beginning student will need.<br />The two sections do not hurt the overall impact of the book, but they do take away space which may prevent either from fully developing its message.  One editorial hangup is the use of arrows to indicate cross referenced terms.  When grouped together, these can be very annoying.  Italics or boldfaced indicators would have seemed more logical.<br />This book makes for a good introduction, and depending on the seriousness of the reader, can be very useful in understanding art history.	2002-02-12

Many of us debated the merits of the book and concluded it really failed to deliver any type of lasting impression.  Yet it won a Pulitzer Prize.<br />All through the book I kept waiting for Virginia to &quot;transform&quot; as the title indicates it did.  While Isaac presnts a lot of detailed information, it never really deliverd a convincing argument.  &quot;Stillborn&quot; is one term that comes to mind.  In comparison to Edmund S. Morgan's &quot;American Freedom American Slavery&quot; (or vise versa) Isaac book misses the mark.  Morgan's work shows a definite transformation in how Virginia became a principal player in the establishment of slavery.<br />Isaac's book is not a total waste, as it does cover a shorter period of time in greater detail than Morgan, but Morgan remains a master historian while Isaac has more work to do.	2002-02-12

The editors have done a fine job compiling most topics referenced in the Bible into a concise single-volume tome.  Each book of the Bible is covered, as well as books of the apochrypha; the list of characters covered is nearly complete; and the many themes of modern religious scholarship is, at least to the novice, very comprehensive.  There are a number of maps at the end to rival Biblical atlases.<br />There are at least two omissions that perhaps should not have been left out.  There is no individual entry on Caesar Augustus (though he is mentioned within the context of the Roman Empire).  Augustus dominated his world, in fact Herod and Pilate were mere role players within the greater Roman imperial framework.  The fact that Herod and Pilate gain more attention in both the Oxford Companion and the Bible, reflects the regionality of the Bible, but for comparison purposes, a specific entry on Augustus would have helped gain perspective.  The other omission is the town of Emmaus.  In itself this is insignificant, but considering the resurrected Jesus chose this town to first appear is no small matter.<br />Omissions aside, this book lives up to its name.  This is indeed a fine companion to the Bible that any interested person should consider purchasing.	2002-01-14

Minear defines PM as a &quot;left-wing daily newspaper&quot; that ran from 1940-48.  Theodore Seuss Geisel landed a job as editorial cartoonist from 1941-2 after which he never drew another editorial cartoon again.  Minear shows how Dr. Seuss conveyed his political beliefs into cartoon format.  Hitler, Mussolini, Stalin, Petain, Laval, and Lindbergh, were often among the personages depicted in some negative political light.<br />Minear does not wax sentimental towards what Dr. Seuss eventually became in that he uses anti-Japanese-American cartoons as well as those that modern American Seuss fans can be proud of.  Anti-Japanese-Americanism is the only apparent negative racial flaw in the Seuss arsenal.  African-Americans and Jewish-Americans were not subjugated to similar negativisms.<br />Fans of Cat in the Hat or Green Eggs and Ham or the many other Seuss works will delight in seeing historical figures drawn similarly to later Seuss creations.  This is an important book that shows a little known aspect of Geisels life, one previously limited to biographical sketches.	2001-09-04

Gilbert uses 164 maps to illustrate virtually every aspect of the war from the first shots to the middle east to Africa to the final lines of the Versailles treaty.  It even has maps of unfought campaigns of 1919.<br />Gilbert clearly has a thorough understanding of his subject and knows what makes for an effective war atlas.

This book virtually eliminates any need for another rival atlas to be compiled, and any serious scholar of the war should endeavor to purchase this fine volume.	2001-09-04

Originally written in 1971 with a second edition printed in 1997, it retains enough of the first edition to make the reader wonder if modern scholarship may have passed it by.  True there is no indication of what has been updated in the newer edition, and the author in the early chapters does little to challenge long standing conclusions on World War One's origins.  But Lafore ultimately shows why his original work warranted a second edition.<br />This book does not examine economic, social, or military causes of the war in any great detail.  In part this is what makes the book appealing.  Lafore instead follows traditional diplomatic arguments upon which his conclusions are based.  He does seem to favor conservative viewpoints by stating the fringe areas of Europe (the Balkans, Ireland, and frontier provincial areas such as Alsace-Lorraine) did much to thwart the ambitions of the great powers.  He also reluctantly includes Austria-Hungary with the great powers though it was comprised of the very fringe areas he is critical of.<br />Lafore does avoid one traditional Anglo-French opinion, that Germany bore sole responsibility for the war.  This he flatly denies.  Instead, he shows how each great power was in part responsible for its own actions, and how their actions subsequently crossed the frontiers and affected their neighbor's or allies'.<br />The title is somewhat a misnomer as he seems to brush on the period of 1871-1913 though in insufficient detail to connect it to the outbreak of war in 1914.  In fact the first half of the book is a bit meandering.  However, the real merit of the study covers the period 1913/4 and this is where Lafore exhibits his understanding of the wars' origins.  But this does not mean the reader should merely skim the early chapters.  There are ample euphemisms, witticisms, arcane words, and indeed humor (&quot;No one quite agreed on where Macedonia was-but wherever itwas, it was a problem.&quot;) to keep ones interest.<br />But it remains the last chapters, and especially the final pages that demonstrates the books' value, and for this reason it should be considered by anyone with an interest in the Great Wars' origins.	2001-09-02

Herrmann traces the roles and developments of land armies to demonstrate how World War One came to happen. His work is well written and maintains a pace that makes it an excellent read for either the serious historian or the casual military history buff. Herrmann tracks the many international crises from 1904 to 1914 to show how each contributed to national military awareness and, more importantly, perception of one's status among the greater European community. <br />Herrmann does not believe there was a massive arms race (vis a vis the Anglo-German naval race) until relatively late in the period in question. Rather he contends each country made moderate changes in both military and diplomatic policies in attempts to gain better positions compared to their rivals. This usually meant distinct there were winners and losers, but war itself was never really considered until 1914. <br />But this isn't to say war was never threaten. Indeed Germany came to use war bluffs often, beginning with the 1905 Moroccan crisis. After this event, both Germany and France began to give more serious thought to an impending war. Herrmann uses his analysis to consider the possibilities of what limited war in 1905 or 1909 (the Austro-Hungarian annexation of Bosnia) might or might not have accomplished, and this is what makes his work appear so complete. He not only covers the events, but he expands them into what might have occurred and what it might have meant. But Herrmann does not venture into the realm of &quot;what if?&quot; for the sake of developing alternate history. His purpose is to show why such speculations did not occur and what that in turn meant to the realities of the time. One important conclusion through this process shows that Germany had a much lesser chance of winning any general war after 1906.<br />Herrmann covers both Moroccan crises well, but perhaps could have done more justice to boththe Bosnian crisis and the Balkan wars (the Second Balkan War gets approximately ½ sentence worth of coverage). The lines drawn during the Moroccan crises were perhaps easier to discern than sorting the Balkan imbroglio, but Balkan coverage remains the one weak point in this otherwise excellent study. <br />But Herrmann recovers well at the end to cover the outbreak of war thoroughly. Again he speculates on possible scenarios had war not occurred (i.e., possible Anglo-German rapprochement) but this serves his true purpose of explaining why events did occur rather than dwell on those that did not. The Arming of Europe is a very important contribution to World War One studies, and should remain so for years to come.	2001-08-26

Author David Blackbourne has written what should be the standard for years to come.  His work covers German political, economic, social, religious, and even intellectual history during this lengthy but formative period.<br />Some of his phrases are clichés (i.e., Germany had &quot;no 1789&quot; which might imply they skipped a year) but his understanding of German history is undeniably acute.  He also often stresses how issues like ideas and/or revolutions came &quot;from above&quot; but again this detracts nothing from the overall effort.  Unlike earlier others, he works to keep all personalities and occurrences into perspective.  His handling of the 1850 Treaty of Olmutz is significantly different than Erich Eyck.  Likewise Bismarck, though obviously influential, is referred to as &quot;a giant among pygmies.&quot;  Bismarck's wars against Denmark, Austria, and France are intentionally glossed over, but a bit more detail might have been warranted.<br />Perhaps Blackbourne's most important message is how Germany ultimately developed into what Eyck referred to as a &quot;machtstadt.&quot;  Arrogance, chauvinism, and bellicose attitudes eventually led Germany into World War One.  Blackbourne does not conclude that Germany caused the Great War, but its machtstadt-like tendencies did not help its case, either.<br />If there is a flaw to the book its how Blackbourne chose to end it.  Rather than reflect on the 138 years covered, he projects towards Nazism as if setting the stage for another study.  This is fine, but he never really tied the years mentioned in the subtitle together.<br />But Blackbourne's effort remains important nonetheless.  This work is very readable and the enthusiastic reader will find it difficult to set down.  As mentioned above, this book should be the standard introduction to German history for years to come.	2001-08-15

Eyck's book is not biographical, but rather shows how Bismarck permeated every aspect of German politics.. At times Eyck's writing is as complex as Bismarckian diplomacy, but the reader will find this an indispensable addition to understanding German history.<br />Eyck illustrates Bismarck's genius in working to unify Germany under Prussian leadership, but is not afraid to criticize Bismarck when warranted (he even uses a using biblical reference to chastise Bismarck at one point).  Bismarck used alliances with Austria, France, Italy, and Russia at various times to further Prussian or German objectives, then subsequently dissolved many such alliances as Bismarck's ambitions changed.  Eyck suggests that European history would have been vastly different had Bismarck pursued a similar alliance with Britain.  But because Bismarck could never dominate British diplomats like he did those from the continent, such an alliance proved impossible.  However, part of Bismarck's genius was knowing when to stop wars of aggression (Bismarck did not fight a war after he defeated France in 1871) and opt instead to pursue diplomatic channels.<br />Eyck works Bismarck's career to its natural conclusion when he came into conflict with the new emperor, Wilhelm II.  The old chancellor is portrayed as having outlived his effectiveness and alienated most Germans in his attempts to retain power.<br />Eyck's writing style is at times cumbersome, but more importantly is the confusing editing.  Many times foreign phrases are not translated, particularly lengthy sentences that are part of some important point.  However, several short phrases are translated, even those that are quite self-explanatory.  But Eyck remains a credible scholar proven by the fact that this volume is still in print in spite of the fact that it is nearly forty years old.	2001-07-25

Forrest McDonald details several decades of American history depicting various issues regarding states rights and how the different administrations, congresses, and Supreme Courts dealt with them.  The book begins slow, but builds momentum as McDonald explains his theory.<br />McDonald's book is detailed and thorough but his approach seems to favor the federal government and limiting the power of states.  When states do fulfill their destiny it is in the form of secession to the detriment of all.  McDonald is also critical of Jeffersonian Republican politicians, specifically Jefferson, Madison, J.Q. Adams and Jackson.  Jefferson is particularly the object of McDonald.  He refers to him as &quot;timid&quot; and &quot;obsessed&quot; and his ideologies were &quot;treasonable.&quot;  (pp. 49-64).  Similarly, Madison's &quot;blunders&quot; led to war (p. 67), while Adams committed a faux pas regarding public works (p. 93), and Jackson did not understand his own position on issues (p. 96).<br />The early portion of the books sees McDonald meander from one issue to the next with no apparent vision, but he makes up for it in subsequent chapters involving Union dissolution and Civil War.  If the reader can bear with the author until this point, the book is mildly rewarding.	2001-06-02

The general analysis of wars, expansion, and elections are useful, but maps of political party development in the Cleveland area or prostitution in New York City are not entirely relevant to the general American history student.  Similarly, many of the accompanying texts offer little detailed insight into the topics the maps cover.<br />This book should be considered a general resource, but for an in-depth historical atlas, the reader must look elsewhere.	2001-05-30

Instead of traditional theories that still attempt to place war-guilt and blame onto Germany, Herwig's position is that war needs to be viewed from Germany's position.<br />In describing the German point of view, Herwig illustrates how the war might have been the brief encounter people expected in 1914, but became a drawn out conflict largely due to Austria-Hungary and the ineptness of Austrian leaders.  Once this occurred, it was only a matter of time before Germany could no longer sustain its war effort.  Food shortages on the German homefront greatly hindered German military capabilities.  Germany kept tapping its reserve of manpower usually to bolster Austrian blunders.  Frequently Germany saved the day and kept Austria in the war (Germany had little choice but to assist her feeble ally if there was to be any hope of winning the war).<br />But Herwig is also critical of German high command,Falkenhayn, Hindenburg, and Ludendorff for its handling of the western front, notably the Somme, Verdun, and Passchendaele.  The German high command was no more or less capable or inept as the allied high command; Germany as a nation was as much caught up in the war as Britain, France, or Russia.  Herwig's main point is that after seventy years, the war guilt blame still falls upon Germany because Germany lost the war and Britain and France dictated the peace.<br />This book is essential for any student of the Great War.  Herwig's thesis may seem radical to those who prefer the war-guilt pro Anglo-French analysis, but Herwig's understanding of the war and his presentation of facts cannot be easily discredited.  His outright blame of Austria-Hungary as Germany's real nemesis may sound like sour grapes, but this is an outstanding historical effort.	2001-05-30

In Dreadnaught, Robert Massie thoroughly analyzes the decades before the Great War to illustrate how the war occurred.  While the underlying theme is the naval arms race between Britain and Germany, Massie covers the royal family relationships across the continent, geo-political ambitions of the several European powers, the build up of armies, and the economic situation.  Each of these elements contributed to the coming of war.<br />Dreadnaught is perhaps the most detailed account presently available in a single volume, and it is worth the time to read this fine book.  From clshes in eastern Europe to north Africa that were precursors to global conflict, to the heads of state involved to the military leaders, this book covers the entire historical landscape that puts World War I in proper perspective.<br />Massie's work should remain the standard in its field for years to come.

Levy uses only historical sources to make his case, leaving constitutional scholarship alone.<br />Levy's efforts are mostly successful and the reader will come away with a solid understanding of the types of laws the framers of the Bill of Rights had to work with when they undertook their endeavor.  He is critical of both Federalists and Anti-Federalists (he seems to poke fun at Patrick Henry throughout the book) and seems to argue that we have the Bill of Rights in spite of our Founding Fathers.<br />One weakness of Levy is his apparent conservative innuendo regarding the differences between the time of the Bill of Rights authorship and our modern world.  He laments the world of 1791 as not anticipating modern free speech issues regarding pornography (though he fails to acknowledge libel and slander laws of today).  He emphasizes the militia element of the second amendment while not wholeheartedly endorsing unlimited gun ownership rights.<br />Levy counters his weaknesses with a particularly impressive argument regarding the fourth amendment.  This, according to Levy, did not trace its roots to England or colonial times but rather was a backlash against past practice.  Unreasonable searches and seizures and general warrants were common in colonial America and the fourth amendment was specifically drafted to cure this ailment.<br />One final weakness is the lack of a concluding chapter that would have served to tie the whole work together, but Levy's overall effort is worthwhile to any with an interest in constitutional history.	2001-05-22

Unlike the first volume, readers of this volume will gain a thorough knowledge of the New Testament.  Koester analyzes biblical figures from John the Baptist to Jesus, and then the various apostles who established the several early Christian churches.<br />Koester remains focused on the New Testament throughout the book, differing from Volume I by not subjecting the reader to diatribes on arcane subject matter that only partially involved the biblical world.  Any reader of the New Testament will find Koester's analyses helpful in understanding how the several New Testament books were written and learn of at least one solid interpretation as to their intent.<br />Koester expands beyond traditional New Testament books by including many that most people will be unfamiliar with, but together comprise the majority of early Christian writings.  Unfortunately, Koester does not spend much time explaining why some of these writings were considered canonical while others were not; and consequently why some were ultimately included in the New Testament, while others were omitted.<br />Similarly, Koester does not write much on the confrontations between Jesus and the Pharisees, and at times contradicts himself by blaming both the Jews and the Romans as being most responsible for Jesus' execution.  Koester's theology never considers the crucifixion as preordained by God.<br />But Koester maintains his masterful presentation of antiquity and the early church, and this book should be considered essential for serious biblical scholars.	2001-05-15

It is intended to provide an introduction, but the reader will come away with much more than that.  This review covers only the first volume.<br />Koester covers a wide range of topics pertaining to the ancient world including political, religious, intellectual, and technological histories and seems to demonstrate thorough knowledge of each.  His intention is to provide a linear transition between Old and New Testaments and place the entire Bible into its proper historical context.  Many religious groups including the Maccabees, Pharisees, and Samaritans are placed in perspective to the greater world in which the interacted.  The reader will fully understand what the political and intellectual world was like during the time Christianity was being established.<br />Koester's unique way of identifying chapters and subparts makes for quick and easy internal cross reference, though his alpha-numeric style is similar to a government regulation or corporate standard operating procedure.<br />Though his knowledge of his subject matter is unquestionable, Koester does demonstrate several weaknesses that readers must accommodate.  He has a strong pro-Hellenistic bias, particularly evident in Chapter 3 when he claims Galen's books are &quot;the last truly great medical works from the ancient times&quot; or how the &quot;Roman period and beyond&quot; were a &quot;decline of scholarship and science.&quot;  Koester's work is occasionally detailed to the point of tediousness.  His chapters on the many religious cults and philosophies do not appear to be written for the casual reader.  The level of detail demonstrates his knowledge but come across as somewhat confusing.  He also dwells exclusively in the world of political and intellectual leaders, the common people are not described in any convincing detail.  This is peculiar because the focus of the Bible, particularly the New Testament is upon the ordinary people who often get caught up in the intrigues and realities of the Roman world.<br />A final weakness is in his presentation style.  He provides no notes to any sources throughout the book.  He lists bibliographies for each chapter, but does not differentiate between his work and that of others.<br />Yet this is still a valuable book that can teach much of the world of the New Testament.  Christianity and the New Testament did not evolve in a vacuum, and Koester does much to help the reader fully appreciate what the world in which they did emerge in was like.	2001-04-30
US	49800795	R2AP4A9AW2CQYH	0191434515	416559304	Oxford Bible Atlas	Books	5	91	92	N	N	Oxford Bible Atlas	The Oxford Bible Atlas, edited by Herbert G. May, is a detailed, extremely useful book that will heighten anyone's general understanding of biblical geography.  It contains more than maps as it delves into the history behind the maps, and the archaeology behind the history.  It cites biblical sources but also cites apocryphal books unfamiliar to most Protestant readers. The end result is a colorful, informative work that helps place both Old and New testaments into perspective.<br />The book is divided into three sections, the first introducing the ancient world, then the several maps, and concluding with an archaeological overview.  Part one blends seemingly incompatible topics of biblical and geologic history.  It includes biblical and secular accounts of ancient history.  The atlas does not attempt to expound too greatly on the &quot;Holy Land&quot; as being somehow superior in importance.  In fact the Holy Land occupies an important crossroads between east and west more so than it stands as a regional religious center of its own merit.  Those who held power such as David, Herod, or even Pontius Pilate were rarely more than a regional or even local rulers who paled in stature when compared to Alexander or any of the Roman Emperors.<br />The map section covers most of the primary locations mentioned in the Bible, and illustrates the vastness of the biblical lands.  Many maps retain ancient place names, though the primary focus is on the Near East.  There are some areas not covered, such as the city of Tarshish, Jonah's destination when he attempted to flee from his responsibilities, and the route of the Exodus does not take them across either the Red Sea, or either the modern Gulf of Suez or Gulf of Aqaba.  But these apparent omissions do little to detract from the overall effectiveness of the maps.<br />The final section is akin to a primer on biblical archaeology.  It introduces Carbon 14 dating, how a site is developed, and a brief history of archaeological efforts in the region.  It shows how cultures are understood by what has survived through the ages, and helps fill gaps when written records are not available.<br />The end result is a very informative atlas that readers of many different backgrounds will appreciate.	2001-03-26
US	49800795	RA0WZP37SQD64	0873513770	586024255	Cooperative Commonwealth	Books	4	1	1	N	N	Cooperative Commonwealth	Cooperative Commonwealth is an important book that serves two primary purposes.  First, it demonstrates the Minnesota Historical Society's extensive collection of farmer cooperative papers and local newspaper archives.  Since MHS published the book, it is a quasi-advertisement for future researchers.  Second, the book's theme traces the development of farmers cooperatives not as a response to prevailing capitalist principles, but as a completion of economic networks into remote rural regions.  Author Steven Keillor demonstrates how Minnesota's Scandinavian farmers established co-ops based upon English and eastern United States models instead of Old World Scandinavian models.  <br />The earliest attempts at establishing union stores failed in part due to inexperience but also because their scope was too broad.  But in time farmers learned that the more specific their objectives, the more likely they succeeded.  Creameries were the first resounding success.  A creamery was established at a crossroads that served local farmers and was soon followed by a store and church.  This hamlet seemed to provide all the local farmers needed.  Fire insurance mutuals and wheat elevators soon imitated the creamery example.  Railroads attempted to piggyback onto successful grain elevators, but farmer control many times prevailed.  Farmer movements such as the Grange and Farmers Alliance aided co-op development, but were not instrumental.  The fact that co-ops outlived national agrarian movements says more for the local institutions than for national organization.  Co-ops eventually bloomed into full-fledged corporate entities such as Land O' Lakes and CENEX.  These organizations played important roles in Minnesota politics.<br />Keillor's book is well written, though the reader will encounter a myriad of acronyms that are seemingly unavoidable.  Keillor's writing style can be difficult to follow at times, but he manages to regain the reader's attention often enough so not to spoil the book.  The primary issue with the book is its reliance on a handful of sources.<br />There are specific examples Keillor puts forth to illustrate his points, but perceived generalizations lead the reader to wonder if these examples were true representation across the state.  To emphasize his point on anti-county set politics, Keillor points out that the county seats of Yellow Medicine, Brown, and Otter Tail counties came under fire by co-ops because their seats were not centrally located within the counties.  However, none of the seats were moved in response.  Also, were there anti-county seat movements of co-ops in counties where the seat was centrally located?  Keillor does not say.  He also uses Freeborn County as his case history for cooperative creameries.  But did the same circumstances happen in other counties?  By design the book intentionally omitted data from counties where other economic endeavors outpaced agriculture, but many agricultural counties were neglected as well.  There is no mention of Stearns, Houston, Nobles, Jackson, Chippewa, Cottonwood, or two dozen other agricultural counties.  What are their stories?<br />One final flaw concerns the last two chapters.  Up until these chapters, the primary focus was on the farmers, not the politicians.  But by the end of the book, Keillor's emphasis is entirely on the governors and legislators and how they interacted with federal programs of the New Deal such as the Rural Electrification Administration.  Farmers become role players in their own economic development.<br />But there is much to be learned from this important historical work.  Keillor sets the stage for future scholarship to either prove or disprove his thesis, and given the extensiveness of Minnesota Historical Society collections, there is plenty of opportunity to expand on the work started here.	2001-03-17

The book is extremely readable which makes it appealing to a wide range of readers, yet provides the serious scholar with insightful historical analysis.  Ellis establishes his thesis and develops it throughout the book, though , arguably, some chapters are more successful than others.<br />The book is by design not chronological, but does include detailed analysis of each founding father.  Yet the book is not patriotic flag waving.  Ellis' style is reminiscent of the consensus historians of the 1950s but with a modern approach.  His portrayal shows the founding fathers separated by personalities and differences of opinion, but with the unique ability to set ambitions aside (more or less) to accomplish the nation's business.  For instance, Alexander Hamilton and John Adams were both Federalists yet they hated one another, Ben Franklin drew criticism for anti-slavery beliefs, Thomas Jefferson ceased correspondence with George Washington (forever) and Adams (for fifteen years), James Madison and Hamilton divided the government, and Aaron Burr eventually killed Hamilton.  But with the exception of this final example all were able to deal with these differences for the good of the country.  Ellis illustrates his chapters with masterful synthesis.  <br />There are times when Ellis' theory appears to wander, as with the case of slavery and the official &quot;silence&quot; that governed the subject.  In this case the problem did not go away but instead exploded seventy years later in civil war.  He also meanders throughout the chapter on Jefferson and Adams to the point that reading becomes tedious, but his overall effort is not adversely impacted.<br />It is Ellis' ability to synthesize that makes Founding Brothers so appealing.  Political rivalries are not the product of recent history.  Indeed, they are endemic to every generation of politicians.  ButEllis' point is that these differences do not have to permanently scar the nation as a whole.  Though he does not say it, this book ought to be required reading for anyone who enters Congress.  The message is simple: check individual ambition at the Capitol door and perform the duties they were elected to do.  In fact the first paragraph of &quot;The Collaborators&quot; should be the required method for determining presidential races.<br />Practically anyone who picks up this volume will not be disappointed.  Ellis takes a complex period of history with an extremely complicated set of characters, and puts it into a concise, enjoyable format that amuses as well as teaches the reader.	2000-12-09
US	49800795	R1BQ6NAV2QSW84	0670889040	108158930	Woodrow Wilson (Penguin Lives)	Books	3	14	17	N	N	Woodrow Wilson	In Woodrow Wilson, Louis Auchincloss provides a useful, albeit brief account of our 28th President.  The book touches on the highlights, both good and bad, of Wilson's life, and gives the reader insight into the complexity of Wilson's mind.<br />Readers of Woodrow Wilson will find a man of enormous intellect who viewed himself as somehow ordained by God to lead the world into a higher level of peace and harmony, but who also battled with arrogance that did not allow him to accept gracious defeat.  As a history professor he was well liked by students, but as university president he was beset by strife involving administrative decisions.  He appealed to Democrats who wished to cleanse the party of William Jennings Bryan's influence, and accepted the nomination for Governor of New Jersey accordingly.   He even adopted a Populist position to appeal to the masses.  When the Republican Party divided in 1912, he was assured the Presidency.  In that office he was forced to balance personal convictions and political realities that culminated over  the ratification of the Treaty of Versailles.  This ultimately proved to be Wilson's demise.<br />Auchincloss' portrait explores many of these complexities, but at times appears to gloss them over.  The rivalry between Wilson and Henry Cabot Lodge oddly is detailed from Lodge's perspective, but the author does not particularize how Wilson reciprocated.  Auchincloss does not describe in depth the differences between Lodge's snobbish Harvard arrogance, Theodore Roosevelt's heroic jingoism of a bygone era, and Wilson's self-righteous purveyance of his own world order, and how each affected the others as well as the world around them.  Auchincloss also has difficulty in describing Germany in World War One in that it was fighting a war of delaying defeat by 1916 and not turning the tide towards victory.<br />In the end, however, readers will find Auchincloss' work useful and poignant.  He inserts comparisons to future Presidents in an amusing way while discussing the merits of Wilson's administration.  Woodrow Wilson may not be a definitive work but, due in part to its brevity, should be considered appropriate reading for High School level history courses.	2000-11-24
US	49800795	RQ7P5CSYHKH8X	0670853380	442684524	The Balkans: Nationalism, War and the Great Powers, 1804-1999	Books	4	9	12	N	N	The Balkans	Misha Glenny's The Balkans is an outstanding effort to make sense of the current imbroglio by placing it into historical context.  Too many people have no understanding of the region's past, so the temptation to conclude that &quot;those people have hated one another for a thousand years&quot; legitimizes sensationalized media reports.  Glenny's intent to prove otherwise resulted in this provocative and engrossing account.<br />Glenny argues there is no historical basis for national hatreds visible today.  During the Ottoman period Serb and Croat, Muslim and Christian lived side by side with little hostile interaction.  Religion and culture superseded political identities in defining Balkan society.  Glenny does not dispute the theory that the Ottoman Empire was the &quot;sick man of Europe&quot; but the Ottomans did provide a stabilizing presence in the area, even after the Serb rebellion of 1804.<br />However, Balkan history is far from benign.  War has always been a determinant in the political landscape.  Unfortunately, brutal murder, rape, and carnage were characteristics that survived modernizing efforts.  Throughout the 19th century, individual Balkan groups took on the Ottomans (Serbia in 1804, Greece from 1821-30, Croatia in 1848) with varying outcomes, but it was not until 1885 that two Balkan nations first fought one another.  Beginning in 1878, but particularly after 1885, the storm that eventually became World War One began to take shape.  Soon the whole world was impacted by Balkan history.  But the Balkans were not solely responsible for any of the world's conflicts, and they certainly do not have a monopoly on war-related atrocities.<br />Yet this does not mean present Serb-Croat and/or Bosnian tensions were inevitable.  In fact, Glenny writes of specific dates when Serbs and Croats came to blows (as in World War Two, 1967, or after 1991) but implies the interim there was relatively calm.  Bosnia is specifically discussed at certain points (1908, 1914, 1992) but it is not a scene of nonstop bloodletting.<br />Glenny's work reflects a masterful understanding of his subject.  Many readers may learn of events for the first time.  The Greek-Turkish War of 1921-3, or the several pre1999 incidents of conflicts over Kosovo are examples.  A Serb bias is noticeable, and his portrayal of Stalin as cooperative with the West detracts somewhat from the book, but the overall effort is excellent.  The Balkans should be considered by anyone interested in southeast Europe.	2000-11-23
US	49800795	R2ZML1G5NLMG2M	0679454799	124549067	Into the West: The Story of Its People	Books	4	10	11	N	N	Into the West	Into The West is an engrossing, fast-paced demographic survey that characterizes development of the American west. Walter Nugent sets out to draft a people's history that omits (intentionally) political and economic theories, insofar as these were not the primary motivators behind the book. Nugent sets out to study five myths (Jeffersonian agrarianism, exploiting resources, i.e., &quot;Gold Rush,&quot; California Dreams, rugged individualism, and migration) that presumably have served as motivators to move west. Then, once he establishes the boundaries of the west as the Pacific Ocean and the 98th meridian, he begins his study.<br />Nugent's style promotes undying optimism and steadfast confidence in the resiliancy of the land if not always the individuals that settled it. At times Nugent seems to favor West Coast urban (Seattle, Portland, and especially California-particularly Los Angeles) as the most fortunate western areas, though the experiences of each western state serves as supporting evidence for his theories. Since the book has clearly defined geographic boundaries, there is not the temptation to view the Old Northwest or Kentucky, or even Minnesota or Missouri, as the &quot;west.&quot; Nugent does not confuse west and frontier.<br />Nugent draws on intricate detail to support his work. He writes of French communities in 1750 Texas, and Mormon colonies from Pocatello to San Bernadino to Mesa to Mexico. He understands what the Ogallala aquifer meant to the high plains. At times the book seems too slanted towards California, but then the nation's most populace state demands intensive evaluation.<br />Nugent's conclusions are precise. None of his aforementioned myths wholly explain western development, but each still played a significant role to those who moved there. Jefferson would have been hard-pressed to base agrarian ideals on western homesteading. Gold Rush mentality reappeared as people sought gold, silver, various other precious metals, and oil shale.California Dreams occasionally lead to riots (1965, 1992), displacement (Japanese internment camps), or emigration to other states. Rugged individualism occasionally means beatnik, hippie, or other alternative lifestyles. Migration occasionally means returning east or back across the oceans altogether.<br />But this is what Nugent wants to illustrate. The west is dynamic not stagnant. It is multicultural, not homogenous. Into The West is a fine example of one scholar's attempt to define the people of this most urban settlement area.	2000-08-13

This book is for the serious military historian; the casual &quot;history buff&quot; will probably be  disappointed by the solemn nature of the discussion.  But for those who  seek an in-depth analysis of how European monarchies approached warfare  from the mid seventeenth century through Waterloo, this book has much to  offer.<br />Black spends considerable time explaining the &quot;military  revolution&quot; theory of historian Michael Roberts, then spends the  remainder of his text refuting it.  To Black there was no real revolution  in military affairs, but rather a gradual transition in application.  For  every advance made by European nations, there were events that stood in  stark contrast.  For example, Austria won major victories over the Turks in  1683, 1716, and 1717, but the Turks responded with victories over Austria  in 1739 and 1788.  Russia expanded its empire to the North American Pacific  coast, but in 1802 native Aleuts destroyed a Russian base.  Black cites  these as evidence there was no unbroken linear pattern of European  dominance.<br />Another indication that military develoment was not  revolutionary was the lack of technological innovation.  For every  visionary who thought outside the box, there were economic reasons not to  produce wonder weapons in large volumes.  Black attributes this to a  non-industrialized economy.  Local artisans produced most of the weapons  used, and most were unwilling to gamble on radical ideas that may not be  widely accepted.  Thus rockets (developed in the mid 18th century) and  submarines (first used in 1776) remained novelties.<br />Black carries out his  transition vs revolution hypothesis throughout the book, and does it well.   The numerous references to lesser know wars (such as the Polish or Bavarian  succession wars) or to virtually unknown battles demonstrates a complete  familiarity with his subject.  Reading is laborious at times but the result  achives Black's intent.  Europeans transitioned from one period to the  next, but military affairs were hardly revolutionary.	2000-05-30

His narrative achieves his goal of writing a  book for the general public while satisfying the needs of historians.   Anderson's detailed analysis of the events and personalities in the war  makes for a fast paced and entetaining read for anyone even remotely  interested in the subject.<br />However the book is not without its flaws.   Anderson's careful analysis of the war is excellent, but when attempting to  push back &quot;revolutionary&quot; responses to British colonial  administration, his argument becomes somewhat muddled.  Colonial anger and  frustration towards the various British ministries became radical almost  from the first postwar tax (the Sugar Act) and had definitely achieved  radicalism by the Stamp Act.  Anderson's point that these taxes were rooted  in the recent war is obvious, but he fails to account for why suddenly  colonists resorted to mob violence to voice their opinions.  In the end  there is no &quot;radical&quot; explanation for colonial opposition to  attempted British controls.  Instead, Anderson resorts to unimaginative  economic interpretations.<br />Anderson's choice of dates is also somewhat of  a hindrance.  If his postwar analysis is plagued by lack of radical  explanations, the book might be considered too long.  He might have  shortened his postwar arguments into a briefer summary to support  war-related imperial conclusions.  However, if his intent was to prove how  the war triggered a series of imperial control measures then the book is  too short.  He abruptly ended his study with the Stamp Act's repeal, but  that was hardly the end of Crown-colony tensions.<br />But these issues do not  detract from an otherwise outstanding effort.  Anderson's mastery of his  subject should make this book required college reading for at least the  next decade.  He could easily address some of the criticisms raised here by  continuing his study through the Revolutionary War.  For this war was,  among other things, a continuation of the Second Hundred Years' War between  Britain and France.	2000-05-01

The true main characters are the bay itself, the Choptank River, and the fictional Devon island.<br />Ironies abound throughout the book. The poor Turlocks achieve  respectability after nearly 350 years of swamp life and inbreeding (though  Michener never really develops this transition). The proud Paxmores  ultimately disgrace themselves, and the Steeds lose their mansion to the  bay. My favorite irony involves the Indian Pentaquod and Devon Island.  Devon was Pentaquod's first refuge, and at face value it provided all he  needed. However, after one storm he witnessed irreversible erosion and quit  the island. The Steeds later experience the same sense of fulfillment and  remain. Eventually the bay reclaims the island.<br />Unfortunately, Michener's  historical narrative misses many key events. The &quot;starving time&quot;  of Jamestown is neglected, as are the Indian raids of 1622 and 1644. In  1718, Maryland disenfranchised Catholics, this is never mentioned. Perhaps  due to Michener's Quakerism, all major wars are either minimally discussed  or neglected altogether. But these are relatively minor disturbances. As a  history major, I choose not to learn my history from fiction; fiction is  &quot;light reading.&quot;<br />Michener uses this book to debate past and  (1978) present issues, offering the reader an insight to his political  viewpoints from slavery to Watergate.<br />Finally, the last paragraph in the  book tied the entire work together in that the reader feels a sense of loss  similar to what the characters must have felt..	2000-03-28
