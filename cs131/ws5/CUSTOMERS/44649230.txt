This book has just the right mix of intrigue, law, humor,  romance/sexual tension, and human emotion.  I think the authors have done another good job with character development--each character was very believable.  Nina is inherently a good person but the authors have given her \\"grace\\" by providing human flaws.  I have enjoyed a few books by these sisters and haven not been disappointed yet.  I read this book on a recent cruise and actually spent time in the stateroom and on deck reading this entertaining book rather than spend time in the casino, playing bingo, or doing some of the other available activities.  I recommend this book to anyone who values believeable plots and characters.	2005-08-28
US	44649230	R2O86FMLIYL5WS	0316693294	265763987	Cat and Mouse (Alex Cross Novels)	Books	3	2	2	N	N	OK	I am a reader who has enjoyed Patterson's books in the past.  I am, however, becoming weary of Alex Cross novels.  Patterson needs to work on more believable character development.  Cross is the perfect detective, perfect, father, perfect friend, perfect grandson, perfect lover, perfect human.  Uh-huh.  And how many people with all of those traits have you met in your lifetime?  His conversations with his children (especially his daughter) are so unbelievable as to be annoying.  Character development is such a key, integral element; when it is weak, the entire piece of writing suffers.  The plot is a nice blend of twists--albeit there are some holes but the plot is entertaining. I just do not feel that this work can stand on plot alone. I would not recommend that readers avoid this book but I definitely recommend they do not pay full price for it.	2005-08-23
US	44649230	R1IBWHODSM30A0	1416600302	592486771	Teaching with the Brain in Mind, Revised 2nd Edition	Books	4	65	70	N	N	Mixed review, but has some useful info	I had an interest in the brain and learning and bought a couple of books, including this one.  It sat on my shelf until last week due to time required elsewhere--or so I told myself.  The principal at my school engaged me in a conversation on the topic as she is currently reading the book.  (It was nice to find someone who shares this interest, as most others get that \\"glazed\\" look when I bring the subject up.)  Well, I was motivated to begin the book and went right home to read it.  Now, I am a skeptic at heart and need to \\"see things for myself\\"; I do not buy into things hook, line, and sinker.  I found the writing style of this author to be a little lacking and I have several spots where I jotted down notes in the margins when I really disagreed with some things. So, I certainly would not treat this book as the Bible on the brain related to learning.  However, I did get many good ideas to try out in the classroom and I am truly looking forward to getting back to school to implement them. If just two or three of these ideas stand the test of time and serve to improve my teaching, the book will have been worth its price and the time invested in reading it. The author does recommend certain \\"atmosphere\\" guidelines so, I suppose, that is touchy-feely; however, most of these ideas make sense.  A child will not perform to potential when he/she perceives threat, whether it be fear of risk-taking/being wrong, fear of losing the esteem of peers or being mocked, etc.  Feeling threatened, to whatever degree, creates stress; stress does not promote optimal learning.  I also found that this book affirmed some of my current practices such as getting children up and moving frequently.  I will now be sure to do this even more often; it is easy to do and takes little time.  Music will definitely be used more wisely in my classroom in addition to movement.  I have begun reading How the Brain Learns by Sousa now and I ordered two more \\"brain\\" books.  I am almost done with Sousa's book and I like it even more than this one.  While few people (even colleagues) share this interest with me, those reading this review most likely do.  With that in mind, I do recommend this book as it has lots of useful info and ideas but would recommend How the Brain Learns even more.	2005-08-09

While I like that there is a collection of stories in these books, of late I find that the main story drags on and that some of the shorter stories are stories that Ann has previously written about.  If I am paying the price of a new book I don't want to read old fodder.  I understand that Ann has a background in police work (making it near and dear to her heart) but I think there is too much focus on the detectives in the stories.  I don't want to see photo after photo of detectives and D.A.'s.  I'd much rather see photos that support the real life impact of the victim who was a real person.  I do, however, appreciate that Ann avoids graphic and gruesome photos.  I like how Ann tries to make the victim come to life but I often think she goes overboard in relating how absolutely beautiful, intelligent, generous, and vivacious each victim is.  If you have not read very many of Rule's books then I recommend this one; if you have already read several then I would recommend passing.  Although the book is truly entertaining you probably don't want to reread something she already wrote about--especially when there is no update to the story.  Also, in Ann's defense, she wrote about some old, cold cases but they have recently been solved due to DNA evidence.  I can't fault her for writing about these cases.  Indeed, I applaud the diligent people who brought the psychopaths to justice.	2005-01-16

I really enjoy the humor with which she writes.  I have found, however, that as the series has continued I enjoy it a little less.  At first I thought it was because it took so long for each new book to come out.  Now I think it is becoming difficult for Sue Grafton to come up with fresh ideas. R is for Ricochet certainly did not have a riveting plot and at times it lacked credibility. This book lacked some of the punch of earlier books but I still enjoyed it and would recommend it.	2004-08-14

I found part of the ending to be a bit slow but I enjoyed this bookm nonetheless.  The reader is able to feel what the characters are feeling.  The story never becomes hokey as so many love stories can.  Highly recommended.  It is always great to get absorbed in a book that is  both a great read and a quick one as this novel is.

At that point I became a bit disappointed.  I feel that the author got off track and did not know how to bring together a believable closing.  Things got convoluted and there were too many convenient events and coincidences.  I felt let down by the ending.  However, the book is still very entertaining  and I recommend it.  It would be a good book to read on the beach...<BR>I agree that the book is poorly edited but I don't fault the author for that.	2004-06-26

I read it to be entertained--and I was.  The book is an easy read which I find I need every so often.  I enjoyed the book and did not find it to be preachy.  I think some people really do go through their lives in a vacuum of sorts and DON'T realize that human interaction is more than meets the eye.  I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys reading fiction for its entertainment value.	2004-04-06

The reader will feel as though he is alongside Ms. Sebold as she recounts events of her childhood and young adulthood.  I found myself cringing for her as she related the reactions of friends and family to the news of her rape.  It was disconcerting to see how being the victim of rape led to circumstances in which the victim continues to be victimized.  My daughter just started college and I gave her the book to read. While I don't want her to live her whole life looking over her shoulder, I think this book provides a graphic, long-term look at how events can unfold in an innocent person's life.	2004-04-06

I was able to put the pocket folder centers together in on hour (not counting laminating).  The hanger centers are a little bit harder for the children to work with and take more time to put together.  The shoe box centers also take more time to construct but are easily used by the children.  I recommend this book.  I was able to quickly add new centers to my collection.  The centers are colorful and engaging.  A worksheet is included on which children can record their work.  I wish there was another book like this with additional centers that was strictly pocket folder centers--they are so easy to store and take up so little space.  I did adapt some of the non-pocket folder centers into pocket folder centers.	2004-04-04

I learned a lot about tarantulas through this book; they were creatures I never thought much about before.  This text helps to make them seem less \\"creepy\\" to children.  My students love this book and a few of them like to take the book aside and play the parts of tarantula and interviewer.	2004-03-07

The real photo of Mary Smith adds to the engagement of young children.  My class loves this book and I do,too.  This is a part of history that I had never heard before.  Cute ending that the children loved.  I buy a lot of books for my classroom; some are \\"keepers\\" that I allow the children to use for a few days and are returned to my personal collection while others are placed in the children's collection which they have continual access to.  This one is a \\"keeper\\".	2004-03-07

This is a great tool for showing children the importance of punctuation in a fun format.  In this book a teacher decides to give punctuation a vacation.  Postcards arrive and the reader has to guess which form of punctuation wrote it to the class.  Children are able to make connections to the chaos of not having punctuation and how it impacts understanding.  Fortunately, punctuation returns and classroom life is much improved.  I recommend this book.	2004-03-07

It makes him seem more human to children.  Young children are intrigued to have the myth of wooden teeth squelched.  Ther book provides a historical timeline in the back.  This is a great book for children of ALL ages.  Even I, an older child and teacher, learned some things. I had no idea our first president was so obsessed with his teeth and that he had such an active role in the solutions to his dental problems.  Highly recommended.	2004-03-07
US	44649230	R2KHMEZ494NSSE	0316602906	981192109	The Big Bad Wolf	Books	3	0	2	N	N	OK	Being time challenged between work and grad school, I found this rare opportunity for pleasure reading to be somewhat entertaining.  The short chapters made the books one that is easily picked up for a brief five or ten minute reading session.  However, the plot was not very believable and the ending was very disappointing.  If I had known the ending would be so poorly put together I would not have chosen this book; I get so little time to read for pleasure so I would definitely have chosen something more worth my time.	2004-03-06

I found the story boring; it went on and on with the same tendency to overstate without saying much of anything.  I enjoyed Painted House but would recommend passing on this one.	2004-03-06
US	44649230	RJQF9XBWJ1FFF	0807540714	36958989	Moon Sandwich Mom	Books	4	1	1	N	N	Absolutely Adorable	Engaging text with a great message for children.  Probably every child has, at one time or another, felt that his parents are just not as cool as those of another.  Following a \\"the grass is always greener...\\" theme the author takes the reader on a journey through the eyes of Rafferty Fox.  Fortunately the theme of \\"there's no place like home\\" wins in the end.  Well illustrated.  I recently met the author at a teaching conference.  She is an enthusiastic speaker/teacher/writer/parent who has a wonderful ability to incorporate all the elements needed in a good piece of children's fiction.  Don't miss this one.	2004-03-06

While the book provides brief glimpses of different periods in history much of it was lost on the children.  They did not like the illustrations.	2004-02-16

There are no&quot;incredible&quot; offers in this book.  It was a complete waste of money.  You don't need to buy a book to request catalogs.  Companies willingly send catalogs--I certainly don't need this book to tell me where to request a &quot;free&quot; catalog.	2004-02-16

The story has some twists and turns but not so many that the plot become convoluted.  I like a book that keeps me engaged and thinking throughout.  This novel did just that.  I passed this book on to my sister who enjoyed it as much as I did.	2004-02-16

Trolls are again part of the storyline and the two main characters triumph over them in the end.  Children enjoy the plot and how the trolls are cleverly outwitted.	2004-02-16

My students also prefer Van Allsburg's other works over this one.  If you are a Chris Van Allsburg fan I would recommend buying this book; if you are not, borrow it from the library if you feel compelled to read it.	2004-01-26

Sometimes using a variety of organizers for the same skill increases an educator's ability to reach and hook the diverse population found in today's classroom.  I will be attending a workshop by this author and it will be interesting to get new ideas for using these organizers.	2004-01-26

This book was recommended to me by my school principal.  While she is a bit more of a fan than I am, I would still recommend the book to other educators. This is a resource that I return to over time. The amount of worthwhile material and my faith in the ability of educators  skim through redundant text leads me to agree that this is a good addition to any educator's library.	2004-01-26

Also good for children 7-10 to read independently. The author cleverly gives the reader a worm's eye view.  The story also presents a meaningful message as the readers gets to see the perspective of a little-thought-of creature.  Well illustrated.	2004-01-26

My 19-year-old daughter read it at home. She visited my classroom and insisted she be the one to read the book to my class.  The kids loved the story. Poor Grandpa's teeth are missing!  There are several suspects.  The \\"mystery\\" is solved with the last illustration.  About half of my students \\"got it\\" but, regardless, all of the children enjoyed the story immensely.	2004-01-26

I do an author study with my second graders and they particuarly love this book.  They love to hear it read with a bit of a French accent.  The children have great empathy for poor Marcel and really appreciate when he triumphs over the self-absorbed Bibot. This book is in much demand in my classroom after it has been introduced as a read aloud.  Highly recommended.  It is an often overlooked Van Allsburg book but it is actually my favorite.  Don't miss this one.	2004-01-26

I recommend this book in hardcover because it is classic and definitely a \\"keeper\\".  Jonathan is a somber man who is touched by deep tragedy.  He lost his interest in life until a young widow and her son ease their way into his heart.  Very touching story.  Children are enthralled with both the story and the illustrations.	2004-01-04

It is a very good tool for promoting and instilling habits that produce self-directed learners.  I was not only able to help my students by reading this book, but I also helped myself become more self-directed.  I recommend this book to parents and educators.	2003-06-28

Ms. Rule has the ability to make a book of non-fiction read like a work of fiction.  As usual, the well-chosen photographs add to the book without being excessively graphic.  Van Houte/Blackthorn is an abominable waste of a &quot;human&quot;.  It is astounding how many lives this creep ruined--including those of his own children.  It is mind-numbing that such narcissists can thrive in our world.	2003-04-24

It provides many useful strategies which are easily adapted to individual classrooms. The authors reference specific books which lend themselves to cited strategies. ( Some books will prove hard to come by as they are out of print, however.) Current reasearch is presented in a clear manner.<br />Both authors are noted in the field of education and their ability to provide a resource for teachers that is not overly dry and overrun with statistics and obscure studies makes the book a very useful tool in today's classroom.	2003-04-24

I do read this book to my second grade class but I do a bit of my own editing as I go along.  Children love fairy tales and aside from the graphic content in a couple of places this book is a good bargain.	2003-02-08

It is a great tool for determining learning styles and dominant intelligences.  I use this book regularly as a classroom teacher; it helps me keep each child's learning in perspective.  I would also recommend this book for parents as it will provide insight into their children and will help them in their partnership with their children's teachers.  I have found this text very useful in the work I do with parents.	2003-01-19

It is concise and contains a wealth of information. I teach second grade and am working on a Master's degree in literacy. I am finding this book to be invaluable. Much of the information is sorted into charts for easy referencing. So many of the books I have read lately seem to ramble on and on. This book makes it's point and moves on to other salient information. I get rid of so many of the professional books I purchase after I read them. This one is a keeper. It is very pertinent to the current trend in improving the literacy of our children.	2002-11-16
