Scheer's previous work on this matter was entitled \\"A Solar Manifesto\\".  That should give you a pretty accurate idea as to his opinions on the matter.  If you looking for a somewhat-balanced view of the coming renewable energy economy, look elsewhere (for example, Hawken's \\"Natural Capitalism\\").  If you looking for a neo-Luddite environmentalist rant, this book is exactly what you are looking for.<br /><br />There are numerous flaws in Scheer's reasoning.  For example,<br /><br />1:  He repeatedly calls lack of taxes a \\"subsidy\\".<br /><br />2:  He ignores that the most promising photovoltaic technologies are based on things like titanium and ruthenium, which are not renewable and by his own data are in short supply.  Even in the best case they are a complex technology that requires big, centralized plants to product (reasonably) cheaply.<br /><br />3:  He a priori dismisses anything big or centralized.<br /><br />4:  He considers a system that uses more human labor a GOOD thing.<br /><br />5:  In 325 pages, he never mentions the cost of PV in $$/kwh, because it would undermine his point.<br /><br />6:  He repeatedly insults everyone who isn't in his camp.  The word \\"blind\\" must appear a hundred times in this work.<br /><br />I think the greatest example of Scheer's muddled thinking is the final sentence of the book.<br /><br />\\"Renewable resources will bring a new era of wealth-creating economic development - initiated not by bureaucratic fiat, but by the free choices of individuals\\".<br /><br />I think many people would agree with this.  Now, if Scheer hadn't spent the previous two chapters describing in detail the many bureaucratic fiats he wanted in order to enforce his ends upon free people, he may actually finished his book with a coherent point.<br /><br />From a little earlier...<br /><br />\\"Instead [eco-taxation proposals] must be founded on a clearly articulated strategy to drive nuclear and fossil fuel out of the market...<br /><br />At least he is honest.<br />At least he is honest. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-03-05

Although written by an American who served as a translator during the war in Vietnam, the stories still capture that quintessential Asian flavor.  If I had not know otherwise, I would have thought the author was natively Vietnamese.  The stories are set in Louisiana, and focus on the fictional lives of Vietnamese-Americans who have left their home behind.  Though a few stories were less than stellar, the vast majority conveyed a deep sadness and profound optimism that I found truly enchanting.  Don't miss this one!	2002-04-16

Alternating chapters set in present-day Tokyo and a mythical utopian realm entwine one another, descending towards the metaphorical &quot;end of the world&quot;.  Though written by a Japanese, the work hardly reflects its author's nationality.  If the setting were changed to New York, very little would change.<br />While I really enjoyed the first third of the book, I felt it had several problems.  First was that Murakami gave away the &quot;secret&quot; far too early, and by the middle of the book, much of the enchantment was gone.  Second, the techno mumbo-jumbo that underlies Murakami's story is too silly to satisfy technophiles, but too complicated and detailed to satisfy the light reader.  It's best described as bad hard-scifi, rather than simply soft sci-fi.<br />On the other hand, the book still has it's strengths.  It is fast, funny, and dark.  And just how many authors even attempt to combine unicorns and encryption?  Overall, the novel's quirkiness makes it worth the time.	2002-04-10

While it takes quite a while to get going (a couple hundred pages at least), McMurty does a solid job of making his characters seem real and lovable.  Outside of the slow start, my other main gripe is that McMurty plays the same cards a few too many times.  By the end of the book, you begin to EXPECT characters to die ironic, pointless deaths.  But please don't let these minor complaints stop you from reading this fun and memorable epic.	2002-03-01

The first third of the book plods slowly through his childhood with great detail, yet rarely giving a glimpse of the &quot;real&quot; Hirohito.  I do not fault Bix for the later - Hirohito was from birth isolated from the world, to both his detriment and ours.  Once reaching Hirohito's ascent to the throne, the book picks up rapidly, and by the time the work reaches the WWII era, I was wishing it would go slower.  While the immediate post-war period was covered in great detail, I was hoping for a bit more about information about his role in influencing Japanese culture from 1960-1989, but I found this section of the book somewhat lacking.<br />Overall, I enjoyed reading this book, particularly the parts covering the war era (1930-1945).  Bix leaves little doubt as to Hirohito's importance in Japan's unfortunate actions, and places one more dagger into the myth that Hirohito was nothing more than a figurehead.	2002-02-25

The main plot revolves around the TriWizard tournament, a wizardly contest between the champions of various schools.  Harry does not solve one single element of the tournament without either cheating or having some cheat on his behalf - including entering the tournament in the first place.  To be fair, at least Harry believes everyone else is cheating, too.  Unfortunately, this seems to be the closest thing to a moral of the story.<br />Rowling's world is losing some of its internal consistency as well.  If truth potions exist, why is there a concern at all about who is a follower of Voldemort and who is not?  How can potions that second-year-students can whip together consistently confound the most brilliant wizards around on a long-term basis?  Why is Voldemort such a dangerous foe, when he makes every classic bad-guy blunder known to man?  I was actually rooting for him by the end.  The dumb-luck-that-saves-Harry-from-Voldemort this time is the corniest yet, particularly when combined with the collosal stupidy of Harry's enemies that was necessary to allow it to happen.<br />Azkaban had given me hope that this series might turn out well, but this book has made me pessimistic again.	2002-01-07

Filled with timelines for how the author guesses our technology will evolve over the next century, the book reads more like science fiction than science.<br />Mr. Kurzweil has proven himself to be a visionary over the years, but in this book I feel he is getting ahead of himself.  While I would not be surprised in the least to see some of his predictions come true eventually, I feel that the pace that he envisions is far too optimistic.  We will eventually create computers that are as intelligent (and then more so!) than ourselves.  Yet this is not going to come about for many decades, not in just a couple, as Kurweil predicts.  Unfortunately, the author's arguments rely heavily on extrapolation of exponential trends, which rarely, if ever, pan out.  Moore's law will break down in about a decade, and it could be some time before a paradigm shift comes about to start a new burst of computational speed.<br />On the other hand, the book is a great primer into such things as neural nets, genetic programming, and other programming architectures that will be the foundation of our technology for some time to come.  Kurzweil's vision may be ahead of its time, but that does not make it any less compelling - or scary.<br />A fun, fast book.	2001-11-12

Written as a series of letters and journal entries in a quaint Victorian style, Stoker's work is heavily reminiscent of other authors of that time period, including Doyle and Poe.<br />The vampire mythology that has sprung up over the last century has has greatly revamped the powers and weaknesses of Stoker's monster, the core remains.  The dreaded Count Dracula leaves his Romanian castle to come to London, to search for the fresh blood he desires to quench his insatiable lust.  A group of Englishmen must uncover the nature of the beast in order to destroy it and protect their loves.<br />While the book seems somewhat more lengthy and wordy than need be, and its vampire seems almost tame in comparison to modern versions, it still serves as a great reminder how this all began.	2001-10-20
US	51924669	RCCZHYLGIBJXA	0192860925	396036325	The Selfish Gene (Popular Science)	Books	5	27	32	N	N	Pure brain candy	Dawkin's &quot;The Selfish Gene&quot; is a wonderful non-fiction book.  It was a joy to read from cover to cover, and leaves the reader with revolutionary new insights into the evolution of nature and man.<br />The simple premise of the book is that self-replicating genes are what matter - bodies, and even minds, are tools they have constructed to further aid in their reproduction.  &quot;Altruistic&quot; acts - acts that aid other replicating genes at the expense of the gene committing the deed, would gradually be removed from the pool.  Some people object to this line of reasoning - and this book for having proposed such - fearing that it reduces man to selfish automatons.  It does not, for two reasons that Dawkins discusses in detail.<br />The first is an analysis of game theory, drawn from Axelrod's &quot;The Evolution of Cooperation&quot;.  Dawkins soundly demonstrates that many apparently &quot;altruistic&quot; acts are actually a form of mutual cooperation, benefitting both parties.  Dawkins shows that many of these cooperative behavior strategies would be expected to arise spontaneously in nature, and remain stable in the population after doing so.<br />Dawkin's second line of reasoning, dealing almost exclusively with humans, is perhaps the most revolutionary part of the book.  According to Dawkins, humans have another type of replicator besides our genes - our ideas.  Dawkins names such replicators &quot;memes&quot; (&quot;memory + gene&quot;).  Dawkins dicusses the (dis)similarity of the replication of genes and memes, and how memes might well explain a great deal of altruism.<br />Overall, this was one of the most insightful and exciting works I have read in some time.  I looked forward to the moments when I could set down and read another chapter, and was sorely disappointed when I reached the final pages.  Highly recommended.	2001-10-20

He succeeds, only to realize the hideousness of his creation, and subsequently flee.<br />Confused but sympathetic, Frankenstein's monster finds himself shunned by humans.  Eventually, a series of tragedies turns him against humanity, and he turns his thoughts to seeking revenge on his creator for not providing him with either protection or companionship.  Meanwhile, Frankenstein is determined to protect himself and his family, while removing his mistake from the world.  The two spend the latter portion of the novel in a drawn-out duel, spiralling towards misery for both of them.<br />Shelley's work raises profound questions about the limits of science, its requirements for wisdom as well as intelligence, the responsibilities of parents, and the nature of revenge - quite an accomplishment for a novel of only 250 pgs.  Highly recommended.	2001-10-20

In particular, Revel focuses on how the totalitarian Soviet government had a great number of advantages over the western democracies, and how these advantages were used time and time again to ensure small but inevitable victories over the west.  Most important were the Soviet's abilities to avoid media coverage of, and internal and external criticism for, its acts; its ability to embark on courses of actions which are not politically expedient, but will bear fruit decades hence; and its ability to be the aggressor.<br />Such advantages lead the Soviets to a number of small victories over the fifty-year war.  Revel correctly pointed out that the west really had few victories over the Soviets before the communist economy finally crumbled a decade ago.  For example, the Cuban missile crisis and the Korean war were merely draws for the west, precisely because everything returned to how it was before.  Yet Vietnam and Poland were clear victories for the Soviets.<br />This is a solid work that accurately points out some of the weaknesses of democracies when fighting against totalitarians, and just how close we came to losing the struggle against communism.	2001-09-23

The poetry is stirring, and feels as if it is drawn straight out of the dark ages to be placed before you in this wonderful book.  Some have complained of Heaney's failure to follow the original in a line-by-line literalness, but to me this does not matter.  This is the same story I read in other translations long ago, but finally presented in a way worthy of such an ancient and classic work.  This is great book which anyone should be proud to place upon their bookshelf.	2001-09-23

The book starts off just plain awful, with a young girl, Celie, describing her childhood of abuse in poorly-written letters to God.  Through these letters, and a series of letters between Celie and her sister, Celie's life is followed from childhood to late adulthood.  As the book progresses, Celie takes more steps forward and back, and her growth can be seen in the writing itself.<br />Unfortunately, when I read this book, I felt no emotion whatsoever.  It was so obvious what Walker wanted me to feel that I couldn't feel it.  It was as if someone was trying to cram my head full of sentimentality with a sledgehammer.  After the first fifty pages, my attitude towards the book evolved into &quot;Yeah, yeah, I know where this is going - let's just get it over with&quot;.<br />If you like very sentimental books, I suppose there is nothing wrong with this one.  It's a bit difficult to read in the beginning (when Celie is young and her English awful), but it gets easier as it goes, both because the reader becomes more used to Celie's mannerisms, and because Celie's writing improves as she grows older.	2001-09-22

While there is nothing factually incorrect about this portion of the book - it is a compendium of knowledge spanning dozens of civilizations and cultures, I did not find it particularly interesting.  I would compare it to reading a textbook, but it was written with too much of an intellectual bent to be accurately compared to such.<br />The last quarter of the book, however, fell from a high-minded dicussion and description of the nature and purposes of cities into a standard neo-Luddite rant:  Capitalism is bad.  Cars are bad.  Suburbs are bad.  Things are getting worse, and someone (the government) must step in and enforce (my) order.<br />If such is your philosophy, you may very well enjoy this book.  I did not.	2001-09-01

It is not spectacular, nor are its ideas earth-shattering; yet after reading it I felt quite satisfied.  The story follows the life of Okwonkwo, an Ibo tribeman.  A reknowned warrior in his youth, Okwonkwo strives to work his way out from the shadow of his listless father.  Far from a model hero, Okwonkwo is tragically flawed with a quick temper and a rigid mindset.  Okwonko serves as a metaphor for his tribe as a whole.  Both are in some ways beautiful, some awful, and some tragic - and with the coming of the white man, both are doomed.<br />Achebe does an excellent job of portraying the clash of two cultures.  He skillfully avoids politicizing the events and demonizing one side or the other.  Both the tribesmen and the white missionaries primarily consist of honest people.  The conflict between the groups arises not out of evil, but out of ignorance.  The near perfect ending to the story drives this point home with a subtle blow that will leave you thinking for quite some time.<br />While not a perfect book - it was too short to develop the characters to my satisfaction, the language was simple and lacked grace, and the names were often confusing - Achebe's work is well worth the investment of a few hours.	2001-09-01

Though at times passionate and persuasive, most of the short book was simply too vague for Rousseau's semantic games to be indisputable, and sometimes even comprehensible.  Some of his ideas are simply wrong, such as the &quot;noble savage&quot;, while others quite clearly debatable, such as the social contract itself.  I, for one, would fear to live in Rousseau's ideal world, where every right I have is only mine so long as the majority (who never can be wrong) wills it.<br />Whether you agree with him or not, plowing through Rousseau's 150 pages is a necessity for anyone who wants to carry on high-level political discourse.	2001-08-22

Weighing in at a dense 700+ pages, it is not a quick read at all, particularly when it bogs itself down with excessive detail.  Like many of the author's works, this one has a striking Celtic flair, which can be both an advantage or disadvantage, depending on your tastes.<br />Where this book failed for me was in the presentation of its ideas.  There was too much detail and seemingly pointless intrigue between nobles that were hard to keep straight, and not enough action.  The protagonist was not particular exciting, and few, if any, of the other characters likable in the least.  The ending didn't seem clear enough - it obviously was an attempt to wrap the book up, but didn't seem to really resolve the book's mysteries for me.  I felt very disappointed by the time I reached the end.  I had put forth a lot of effort, and was waiting for an &quot;Aha!&quot; moment than never came.  After reading seven hundred pages, I felt that I hadn't been particularly entertained, and hadn't read anything that hadn't been written a hundred times before.<br />Somewhat disappointing.	2001-08-22

While some of the parts are now irrelevant, and some so ingrained into our culture as to no longer be questioned, many remain contentious to this very day.  If you have any doubt about the meaning of the interstate commerce clause or the general welfare clause (the two of which form the justification for most modern federal powers), Madison leaves no doubt as to what they really meant at the time.<br />As an added bonus, this edition contains the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, and helpful notes and introductions that further elucidate the thoughts of the authors.  Powerful, persuasive, and important.  A third of the book is absolutely necessary reading for anyone who cares about politics or government in the least.  It is also a great reference, allowing one to draw powerful arguments straight from the horses' mouths.<br />Every American should own this book.	2001-07-28

It has a feeling of authenticity, as if it is truely an oral story being passed down through the ages, as it once was.  The whole concept of the book is mind-boggling, with stories within stories so many times over that half the fun of reading the book is trying to follow the winding path that the stories lead you down.  The physical book itself is also top-notch, as the Everyman's Library editions always are.  For me, investing the few extra dollars for such a beautiful edition is well worth it.<br />This book may not be what you expect.  It is not the Disney-fied, watered-down version that most of us were introduced to as children.  Several of the more famous stories that most Americans would associate with &quot;The Arabian Nights&quot;, such as Ali Baba or Aladdin, are actually not part of the work.  They were added much later, by the early European translators.  Also, the book contains bawdiness and violence (particularly towards women) that may not be appropriate for young children, so be forewarned.  Overall, I feel that this an authentic, lucid translation of a fantastic story, wrapped in the most beautiful of packages.  Highly recommended.	2001-06-17

The chapters of the work alternate between long episodes detailing the journey of the Joad family from Oklahoma to California, and short sections written from a more abstract point-of-view, about characters un-named.  Though the work is over six-hundred pages, it roars through your head as fast as any book can, with Steinbeck's fury over the plight of the migrants bursting from every page.<br />I doubt anyone can read this work and not feel pity for the Joads, and the real men and women that Steinbeck drew these characters from.  On the other hand, I felt that Steinbeck did not adequately explain the situation from the other side.  It too often seems that the troubles of the migrants stem from the greed of some heartless monster, rather than a honest person who has troubles of their own.  Sometimes, bad things happen and no one is to blame.  Steinbeck seems to forget this.<br />Overall, this is still a classic work of American literature, both for its beautiful prose and intensely important reminder of how things were not all that long ago, and how far we have come since.	2001-06-17

It's ability to withstand the test of time and invade our lexicon is proof enough of its greatness and worth more than anything I could say.  However, I would like to comment specifically on the Norton Critical Edition.<br />I was not particularly satisfied by this edition.  Having never read Faust before, I was expecting this edition to contain within its copious annotations helpful summaries of what was going on in the play.  Particularly in Part II, where things are often quite disorienting, a first-time reader would often be lost without some outside help.  Unfortunately, this edition, despite all the extras it added, didn't contain what I was looking for.<br />If you are deeply interested in Faust, and familiar with the story itself, the annotations are amazingly detailed, describing the sources and motivations that guided Goethe.  If you are a casual reader, however, they will rarely help you understand what is going on if you get confused.  This edition is geared towards the scholarly, not the casual.	2001-06-11

Cut-away diagrams display the innards of these machines, allowing one to see what normally only professionals and enthusiasts deal with.<br />The book is written in a manner that most pre-teens could understand, yet it contains more information than even the most technologically-advanced buff would ever know.

The fact that it has withstood the test of time, and its depicitions of heaven and hell have become ingrained into our mythology, reveal far more than anything I could say.<br />This translation, however, was simply too difficult to read.  It was too full of &quot;thees&quot; and &quot;thous&quot;, and quite frankly did not flow at all.  Reading it was a real struggle for me.  The annotation and Canto introductions, however, were very helpful, and gave me a better picture of what Dante was saying than the actual text itself.  The book also has the advantage of being compact (all three parts in one average-sized book), and reasonably priced.<br />However, I would recommend searching for a translation written in a more modern style, so that Dante's message isn't obscured in a linguistic haze.  What he said was too important to be lost in a struggle with the langauge.	2001-06-10

In a time when one's group identity transcends national borders, and nanowars are routinely fought between various factions, a high-tech nanodevice falls unexpectedly into the hands of a poor young girl, Nell.  The lost device, an interactive story book designed to teach children to think independantly in a time and place where such ideas were not encouraged, sets off a whirlwind of adventure for Nell and all those involved with the book.<br />Like all of Stephenson's novels, this one is a page-turner from the first page to last.  It also has his characteristic abrupt and ambiguous ending, leaving you feeling that there should be one more chapter left that ties everything up in a neat little ribbon.<br />While not particularly deep, this book is broad, fun, and fast.  Enjoy!	2001-06-03

It contains the stories of several survivors of the nuclear bombardment of Hiroshima, from what they were setting out to do that fateful morning until how their lives turned out decades latter.<br />The first portion of the book, dealing with the survivors' stories of the bombing and its immediate aftermath, was the stronger of the two.  It was as haunting, mesmorizing, and terrifying read as I have ever had, yet weighed in at only about a little over hundred pages.  The latter portion of the book, which Hersey added years later to show how his subjects' lives had turned out, was somewhat disappointing.<br />Overall, this is still an excellent book, whose haunting images will remain with you for the rest of your life.  Well worth a few bucks and a couple of hours.	2001-05-13

But none ever came.  I grew more and more bored as it went along, and only finished by exercising a great deal of determination.<br />Perhaps the book was too pessimistic.  I can't recall a single character in the book as having been portrayed in a positive light, except for the &quot;invisible&quot; protagonist.  In Ellison's alternate reality, everyone seems to be a self-centered hypocrite.  Another reader may feel sympathetic towards some of the characters, but I could not find a single one that struck my fancy, or taught me anything but what not to do with my life.<br />At the end of the day, I could not figure out what I was supposed to take home from this work.  The only even remotely sympathetic character was screwed over by everyone he met, and proceeded to then hide from the world.  I've always been a firm believer that if one tries, one can find a flaw - or something nice - in everybody.  But what is the point of the former?  It only leads down a nihilistic pathway that produces nothing constructive.  The whole time I was reading this book, I felt I was being taken down this road.	2001-04-18

Reading Charlotte Bronte's &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; did not change that statistic.  While I can acknowledge the worth and eloquence of this novel, I cannot say that I enjoyed it in the least.  It took a determined effort for me to read it through, and I was quite relieved to reach the end.<br />From my experience, I have yet to meet any male who has enjoyed this book, and have yet to meet a female that didn't adore it.  I don't know what it is about the books by the Bronte sisters and Austen, but for some reason, the gender gap seems a mile wide.<br />For what it is, I am sure it is a great book worthy of the praise it has received.	2001-04-15

Weighing in 700+ pages for a typical printing, this work is not a quick and easy read by any stretch of the imagination.  Many of Smith's great metaphors are found in the first quarter of the book, and I felt bored reading the latter parts.  It is not that Smith was wrong, by any means, but rather that many of his arguments are now well-accepted and can be demonstrated in much more succinct manners.  I feel that Smith's multitudes of examples are not particularly important to the average man.<br />With that said, I reiterate that this is an important work that should be understood by everyone - but this does not necessarily mean reading all of it.  For anyone studying economics, of course, this work is the bread and butter of your field - and is a must read.	2001-04-01
US	51924669	RF7BDF8M5Y42X	0679723161	636015448	Lolita	Books	5	4	6	N	N	A work of art	Nabokov's &quot;Lolita&quot;, without a doubt, is among the most penetrating and beautiful novels ever written.  Nabokov's prose is sublime, which is all the more amazing given that English was not his mother tongue.  He delves straight into the mind and heart of the enigmatic Humbert Humbert, stripping the anti-hero's soul bare for all to see.  Perhaps only in Dostoyevsky's Raskolnikov have the inner workings of a criminal's mind been so thoroughly explored.<br />Some people have objected to Nabokov having even dared to mention Humbert's crime.  But do these people object to depictions of Raskolnikov's awful deed?  What scale does one use to weigh pedophilia vs murder?  Humbert's crimes were not described in detail, and often merely alluded to.  They are not condoned, or glorified in any way.  To propose that merely describing a hideous crime is grounds for censorship (as was often done when this novel was first published) would imply that many of our greatest novels would be banned.  Did not Cain kill Abel?  Did not Achilles dishonour Hector's corpse after he was brutally slain?  Did not a jealous Othello murder his own lover?  Yet does anyone seriously propose banning the Bible, Homer, and Shakespeare?<br />Simply put, this book is a masterpeice at all levels.  It may very well be the most beautiful prose written in the last century.  It's story is deep, penetrating, and moving.  It is loaded with allusion and metaphor, and leave no doubt as to its author's artistic and linguistic abilities.  A great, albiet challenging, read.	2001-03-24

Outward from his home on Brooklyn, Whitman soars out over our great nation, painting a sweeping portrait of mid-nineteenth century America and its diverse inhabitants.  Whitman covers a panorama of ideas and themes, from lofty, aloof musings on the nature of man, to piercing depictions of the horrors of war.  Gems of wisdom hang from Whitman's web of of verse like dew drops - easy to see but hard to grasp.  This is a powerful work, and a never-ending source of beauty.  Unfortunately for me, I am not a big fan of free verse, making this work harder for me to enjoy than I had hoped.<br />Which edition do I recommend?  That really depends on what you are looking for.  If you are just interested in getting a taste of Whitman, I would recommend some of the abridged versions.  I don't feel that reading all 700+ pages of Whitman's poetry is necessary for anyone but his biggest fans and students.  For a complete version, I found the Modern Library edition acceptable, but nothing spectacular.  This work has a multitude of editions, and I would recommend actually holding them in your hand before making a decision on which best suits your needs.	2001-03-04

The translation is wonderful, as the fury and passion that makes Nietzsche's philosophy so popular bursts through in Kaufmann's words.<br />Obviously, this work is a challenge to understand, and even after several readings one will still be finding new insights hidden within Nietzsche's words.  The works contained within this book are decidely anti-Christian, so be forewarned.<br />Overall, this is a great introduction to Nietzsche, contained in a compact and reasonably-priced single volume.	2001-03-03

The strengths of &quot;My Antonia&quot;, in my opinion, would not be obvious to most teenagers.  Taken at face value, as a fictional story of the struggles of Bohemian immigrants to the mid-west, the story has merits which probably underlie its popularity among secondary teachers.<br />However, that is not what makes this book special.  Simply put, both the characters and setting of this novel are beautiful.  Cather clearly loved the land she was writing about, and her passion for the farm country of her youth flowed through her writings.  Her narrator, Jim, reveals the life of the immigrant Antonia, his childhood friend.  Though most of the book is about their childhood together, it is written from Jim's view as an adult.  This is tremendously important, as Jim's observations are clearly bear a mark of maturity that would be out-of-place if the book were written from the point-of-view of a child.  Perhaps this is what many teenagers miss.  Few of them have experienced the profound bittersweet feelings adults have when looking back upon their youth.  These emotions were entwined through the novel from beginning to end, forming a scaffold upon which the story was told.  To miss them is to miss everything that makes this novel great, rather than just historical fiction.	2001-02-11

Modern theories of evolution and genetics have added a tremedous amount of detail to Darwin's work, which obviously are not included in this text.  If you are interested in a more modern adaption of Darwin's theory, I suggest John Maynard-Smith's &quot;Theory of Evolution&quot;.  However, Darwin's work remains a lucid, powerful introduction to evolutionary theory, with a host of interesting examples of how his theory works in nature.  For both its historical and scientific merits, &quot;The Origin of Species&quot; should be part of any literate person's library.  Highly recommended.	2001-02-04

It is a compilation of four of his older works, along with a short fifth work, &quot;Crossing the Craton&quot;, and a narrative introduction/table of contents.  Only about 80 pages of this work are new material.<br />If you have not read McPhee before, this is the place to start.  McPhee is an English major, who has written for decades about geology and the people who study it.  His books are written by a layman, for the layman, and are a joy to read.  He has roamed the country, following several famous geologists as they study their portion of the country.  The book itself is arranged as to discuss the the topics in an east-to-west fashion, roughly following the route of I-80 across the country.<br />McPhee is a master, and brings geology to life in his works.  My only complaint about &quot;Annals of the Former World&quot; is that as a compilation of several books, it at times seem repetitive, as the same points were discussed in multiple works.  Unlike other reviewers, I found no problem with the maps or the layout.  This book is an excellent example of how to write non-fiction, and deserves the Pulitzer that it won.  A must-read for anyone studying geology, and recommended for anyone who enjoys non-fiction.	2001-02-04

Set in the Atlanta area during the Civil War era, Mitchell's story exemplifies the proper writing of historical fiction, with painstaking accuracy of language, mannerisms, and morals.  The war itself is also presented as it should be presented - in full color and with all its moral ambiguity, rather than the black-and-white presentation that so often is the norm in modern discourse.<br />Mitchell's painting of southern culture and the all-encompassing war, however, serve only as the background for one of the most poignant love stories ever written.  Following the life and loves of the willful Scarlett O'Hara, the work delves straight into the meaning and nature of love.  Torn between her now-married childhood love, Ashley, and the outcast Rhett Butler, and in dogged pursuit of financial success after the devastating war, Scarlett lives a life of emotion and passion that few fictional characters have rivalled.<br />Though this work is quite long, it is a very easy read.  The style is light and brisk, the language uncomplicated except in the heavy dialect of the blacks, and the story compelling.  &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; is a great book, a great movie, and perhaps the greatest love story ever told.  Highly recommended.	2001-02-03

Bester's &quot;The Demolished Man&quot; is a true classic of the sci-fi genre, and perhaps the first cyberpunk novel.  Though it does appear dated at times, Bester's work remains as fun and powerful as when it was written fifty years ago.  Threads of Bester's comic book roots can be seen woven throughout the story, which moves along at a brisk, almost frantic, pace.<br />A near future world where a small minority has developed their latent ESP, Bester's world is a compelling mix of utopia and dystopia.  The mind police have virtually eliminated crime, either by rooting it out beforehand, or by always catching their man after-the-fact.  But this safety comes at a dear price, where the unenforcable promise of the ESPers is only guarantee of privacy that most have.<br />However, Ben Reich, as head of a major corporate powerhouse, feels that he can outsmart the ESPers.  Haunted in his dreams by a mysterious man, and driven by uncontrolled passions, Reich decides to eliminate his chief rival, D'Courtney.  The murder sets off a brilliant battle of wits between Reich and the head investigator, Powell, which can only end in the &quot;demolition&quot; of Reich, or the total embarrassment of Powell.<br />Who gets demolished?  What IS &quot;demolition&quot;?  Why would Reich risk so much to kill D'Courtney?  With so many pressing questions, it was amazing to see Bester wrap this book up in such a fulfilling way.  A great mystery with a clever ending, set in a compelling near future world - despite its age, &quot;The Demolished Man&quot; remains a standard-bearer of its field.	2001-02-02

With no apologies, Smith addresses such notables as Chomsky and Gould, attacking the assumptions of the standard &quot;science is about this, religion is about that&quot; arguments.  Particularly, Smith challenges the implicit assumption that only science deals with facts.<br />Smith also addresses how scientism (not science, which is the study of the physical world, but 'scientism', which is an unflagging faith in science) has invaded our political and educational structures to such a degree that it is hardly even questioned.<br />This is an excellent work on the conflict of science and religion, and does a wonderful job of backing up its title.  I have been thinking about this book almost non-stop since I finished it several days ago.  It was that important and that good.  Sometimes, the book appears to be a bit rushed and meandering, but the message remains lucid and direct.  My highest recommendations.	2001-01-30

It is loaded with precisely-defined technical terms and equations, making it a chore to read and understand.<br />As for Keynes' arguments, there is much one can say.  At times, he is dead on.  At times, he is dead wrong.  Often, I felt that his conclusions resulted from his particular (and arbitrary) definitions and dichotimies.  For example, central to the work is the distinction between &quot;investment&quot; and &quot;consumption&quot;.  I find these impossible to separate in the first place!  Could I not say that my buying of Keynes' book was an &quot;investment&quot;?  Could I not just as legitimately say it was &quot;consumption&quot;?  I am not sure I would buy any conclusion that was deduced from such a tenuous division.<br />On the other hand, his discourses on the herd mentality of the stock market are dead-on, and can be seen even today in our current boom-bust cycle.<br />Overall, I felt that this book was a lot of work, and separating the wheat from the chaff is more time consuming than the amount of wheat justifies.  It may be historically important, and in some parts, currently relevant, but there are better ways to learn these lessons.	2001-01-25

Blending ideas from Keyes, Orwell, and Mann with such erudite topics as alchemy and poetry, Disch creates a haunting dystopia.  Imprisoned for his unwillingness to fight in an undescribed war, the central character, Louis, is recruited to chronical the events in the underground Camp Archimedes - where a new test drug makes geniuses out of its recipients, as it slowly kills them.  The interplay between the doomed geniuses and their captors is beautifully done, as the former become more desparate - and smarter - every day.  The ending is marvellous, causing one to re-evaluate the entire book in a new light.  &quot;Camp Concentration&quot; is a work of art.  But be forwarned - it is every bit as intellectual as the tragic people it portrays, and is as challenging as any sci-fi book you will find.  Highly recommended.	2001-01-20

Fifty-seven years later, there is little doubt as to who was right.  The most prosperous nations on Earth are also the most free - socially AND economically.<br />Hayek is one of the fathers of the neo-classical school of economic thought, and modern libertarianism.  In this book, Hayek demonstrates the inherent contradiction between freedom and a command economy, and the inevitable descent of socialism into totalitarianism.  The accuracy of his predictions of the long-term results of communism were uncanny, and a dire warning against attempting this road yet again.<br />This is an absolutely essential book for a modern libertarian or student of economics, as well as any liberal or conservative with an open mind and a desire to understand the vastly differing economies and governments of the world.  Written for the layman, it is lucid, clear, to-the-point, and, most importantly, has been backed up by world events during last half-century.  A classic work in the field of economics.	2001-01-20

In this semi-autobiographical work (a trademark of Dickens' writings), the life of a poor young boy, Pip, is followed from his humble beginnings to his rise into the middle-class, due to the mysterious aid of an unknown benefactor.  His pursuit of Estella, a beautiful young girl raised to break the hearts of men by her jilted caretaker, Ms. Havisham, is a classic of literature that has been repeated countless times since.  The tragic, gradual break between Pip and his family (particularly the humble but caring Joe) is heartwrenching.  Pip's eventual realization of the insincerity of the middle class, and his love for Joe, brought tears to my eyes.<br />&quot;Great Expectations&quot; is a wonderful, moving book that has been copied and satired again and again, from Mishima's &quot;Forbidden Colors&quot; to South Park.

As scholar of mythology, Cambell has both a deep and broad understanding of the countless myths that have been told over the ages - and the handful of messages that they convey.  Weaving threads through such arcane and  seeming unrelated topics such as Native American, Egyptian, Hindu, and Greek mythology, James Joyce, medieval romance, Star Wars, and the back side of a one-dollar bill, Cambell displays an intense passion for distilling away the metaphors that differentiate the multitude of myths, and finding the few gems that lie at the heart of them all.  Absolutely an excellent book.<br />The illustrations in this edition are beautiful and fascinating, but one could question whether they were worth the extra price.  I found this version to be worth the investment.	2001-01-15

As a professional psychologist, Frankl's unique point-of-view within the Nazi concentration camps allowed him to observe phenomena that others would have missed.  The theories that he refined while imprisoned, termed &quot;logotherapy&quot; (meaning-therapy) are a wonderful way a looking at ourselves and our problems.  Logotherapy focuses on the importance of finding meaning in our lives and our activities - the very factor that Frankl noted was the most valuable in surviving the camps.<br />I cannot give a higher recommendation from this book.  It is profound, moving, informative - and under two-hundred pages.  Without a doubt it is worth the handful of hours required to read it.	2001-01-13

It is a tremendous example of soft sci-fi, with little high-tech wizardry (though this book does contain the oldest reference to an instantaneous-communication ansible I have encountered), but deep character developement and social commentary.<br />Unfortunately, I just could not find either of her hypothetical societies believable.  The capitalistic Urras seemed to be a mix of 21st century technology and 18th century ethics.  Though at face value, Urras appears to be a scathing condemnation of capitalism, a deeper look shows the problems on Urras result less from its free markets than from its totalitarian government and rampant &quot;isms&quot;.  Likewise, the anarchistic, communist utopia on the moon Anarres also did not ring true.  Le Guin simply did not convince me that the inherent conflicts of anarchy and communism could be resolved.  People on Anarres did not shirk duties or commit crimes, even though they did not have self-interest (ala capitalism) or the threat of force (ala totalitarianism) to bring them in to line.  Le Guin seems to explain this by proper education, social pressure, and child-rearing, which I couldn't swallow.  I did enjoy her pointed commentary on the tyranny of the majority (even absent the rule of law), and of the oppression of the individual by social pressure for conformity.<br />Overall, this rates as a sci-fi classic - even though it barely qualifies as sci-fi at all.  Le Guin's best work.	2001-01-05

Dunbar and May's work did just that.<br />Michigan : A History of the Wolverine State lies somewhere between a textbook and a more casual non-fiction text, with copious endnotes for the historian, yet a clear, flowing style for the casual reader.  It would serve as an excellent text for a college course on the subject.<br />I found reading this work to be immensely valuable and entertaining, and a great conversation starter.  In it you will find explanations of the origins of nearly every facet of Michigan society.  Beginning with the ancient history of the Native American tribes, and finishing with the education and tax reforms of the early 1990's, very little is left behind.  You will learn such quirky facts as the meaning of the name &quot;Ypsilanti&quot;, why Kellogg and Post Cereals are both headquartered in Battle Creek, and the true story of the Michigan-Ohio border war.  Comprehensive, lucid, and entertaining.  Recommended.	2000-12-29

For a westerner, however, it is almost impossible to understand without previous knowledge of Hindu philosophy or copious annotation.<br />This book, consisting of Gandhi's translation of the Gita, as well as commentary he presented to his followers at prayer meetings in 1926, is an important and highly-regarded version of the ancient text.  Gandhi's commentary, actually comprising about two-thirds of the work, was lucid, profound, and clearly indicative of the deep wisdom of one of the twentieth-century's greatest men.

Rosenthal and Birdzell discuss in the appearances of the requirements for capitilism, such as acknowledgment of property rights and consistent and predictable law.  Also discussed are the political, social, or economic changes that caused feudal society to crumble and a variety of free markets to gradually take root and then blossom in Europe.<br />This book was thorough and informative, though a bit repetitive and somewhat dry.  It makes a wonderful companion to Diamond's &quot;Guns, Germs, and Steel&quot;, filling in where the later left off.	2000-12-20

Rather, by presenting the virtues of an obviously fictional paradise, More is backhandedly criticizing his contemporary society, in a time where such criticism could land one in very hot water.  In this respect, More's work is similar to what Swift did later in &quot;Gulliver's Travels&quot;.<br />Many of More's critiques of Renaissance society remain valid today.  From crime and punishment to church and state, More diagnoses the ills of his time, and ours.  While short on real cures for these maladies, this book remains a literary classic and the first step towards a real Utopia.	2000-12-20

He writes with great beauty, but also a deep sadness that reflects the slow (and perhaps inevitable) decay of the life that he loves.<br />Foremost in Berry's mind is the gradual shift from the independant farmer who knows and loves his land to the industrial farm, which though more productive in the short term, often ignores the long-term health of the land.<br />Unfortunately, I have to agree with the other reviewer who mentioned that Berry was long on diagnosis, but short on cure.  Sadly, this flaw may well be because there is no cure to be found.  A moving work.	2000-12-19

Woolf's main illustration of this principle was a hypothetical sister to Shakespeare, who, even with the same talents as her brother, would have never had the chances to display her talents to the world.<br />This book is actually rather apolitical, dealing directly with the arts.  It is very positive, and is not accusitory towards men.  It is straightforward and brief, and brings its point across quickly.  For its time, it was an excellent and radical short work, but over the last 70 years it has lost some of its relevance to the modern reader, as its thesis has gradually been proven true.	2000-12-19

Unfortunately, I feel that it has become severely dated, which detracts from the advantages of reading this work.<br />I felt that the first third of the book, dealing with philosophy (particularly existentialism), and Freudian psychoanalysis, was not as interesting or informative as the latter parts of the book.  While some people may disagree, I tend to dislike using a lot of big words to describe simple things, as often happens with philosophers and psychoanalists.<br />The remainder of the book, dealing with women at different times of their lives, or in different situations, was stronger.  Its major deficiency was its being dated, but a large number of her arguments are very relevant today.  Many of her then novel reasonings are now standard modern political fare, for example, her arguments about abortion.  It was interesting to see them in the original.<br />Overall, despite its importance, I cannot give this book five stars.  It has simply lost too much relevance over the years.  The best arguments from this book have become part of the standard fare, while the weaker ones have been lost in time.  A modern reader of this book will not gain much insight into women as they are now, but merely a historical view of women and the feminist movement.  While this is still a worthwhile goal, &quot;The Second Sex&quot; is simply not as important as it once was.	2000-12-19

Unlike Dickens more direct style, however, Mishima's writing is challenging to read, with layer upon layer of metaphor and allusion.<br />This is not a happy story.  The characters are deeply flawed, and their struggles to overcome their lackings are often futile.  The most deserving characters wind up with the least, while Yuichi's beauty carries him through a whirlwind of undeserved fortune.<br />While reading this book is a substantial investment of time, the sordid beauty of writing, as well as its unusual themes, made me feel as if my time was spent wisely.

Its having been voted &quot;The Greatest Book of the Millenium&quot; here on Amazon.com says more than enough about the worth of Tolkien's work.  Rather, it is a review of the several hardcover editions of this fantastic story.<br />There are for major hardcover editions of LOTR, all published by Houghton Mifflin Co.  They are essentially the same price, so I will not take that into consideration.<br />The best of the editions (5 stars) is the blue Alan Lee illustrated version printed in Nov 1991.  I have owned this book for several years, and read it three times.  It is durable, beautiful, and has no flaws that I have found.  The illustrations are wonderful, though most Tolkien fans will have seen these pictures before.<br />The red edition printed in Nov 1974 is also a solid edition of the book (4 stars).  It is every bit as good as the blue version, but does not have the illustrations.  If you are the type of reader that prefers to leave everything to your imagination, this is the version for you.<br />Both the blue and red versions have matching editions of &quot;The Hobbit&quot; (Houghton Mifflin, Sep 1997 or Oct 1973, respectively).  I found both of these editions to be satisfactory.<br />The other two major editions of LOTR - the white three-volume edition from Oct 1988 and the black seven-volume edition from Jan 2000 - are not recommended (2 stars).  The print quality in both is poor, and the durability is less than that of the red and blue versions.  The only advantage of these editions is portability, as the red and blue versions are single-volume and quite hefty.<br />Ramble on....	2000-12-17

Garcia-Marquez's masterpiece is the fountainhead of an entire genre (often termed magical realism), though it has yet to be duplicated.  Getting into this style of book is remniscent of falling asleep - you can't do it if you try.  Once you are comfortably into the book - which many people fail to achieve - reading it is much like a dream, which only ends when you reach the end of the book and awake from the reverie that Garcia-Marquez has created.  This experience alone makes the book worthwhile.<br />The story itself concerns the lives of several generations of the Buendia family, in the mythical town of Macando.  The story is intensely cyclical, with the names, personalities, and fortunes of the townsfolk repeating again and again, from the foundation of the town until its bitter end.  While at times confusing, the bewilderment the story creates adds to its dream-like effects.<br />One Hundred Years of Solitude is an immensely satisfying book, and a literary experience like no other.  Highly recommended.	2000-12-16

After several hours of research and a couple of trips to the bookstore, I decided on the NIV Study Bible - and I was not disappointed.  The linguistic style of the book is straightforward, avoiding unnecessary challenging phrasings and making the book a pleasure to read.  I don't feel that the meaning was sacrificed for the translation's fluidity, however.  The copious footnotes and annotations are perfectly laid out, in a manner that allows easy access to this extra information without interrupting a straight reading of the text.  The appendices which sort important verses by topic (such as &quot;selfishness&quot; or &quot;hope&quot;) are invaluable for finding important quotes.  The various maps, timelines, and book summaries are useful as well.  This is an absolutely essential addition to the library of any serious student of the Bible.  I highly recommend it.	2000-12-15

Crane's language is very simple - appropriate for eighth-graders, mixed with far more challenging dialect.  The story is at once obvious and chaotic - a metaphor for the war it depicts.  The settings are depicted in the same manner, with a mix of fine detail and battle-obscured backdrops.<br />The story's protagonist, Henry Fleming, is a mixed bag as well.  His mental evolution through his first battles is the main thrust of the book, and is every bit as challenging and chaotic as the situations as he finds himself in.<br />This is a book you really have to dig into in order to find the gems - a superficial reading will not suffice.  The language is plain, while the story difficult to follow but not particularly novel.  The worth of the book is contained in its metaphor, which appears at several levels, but has to be actively searched for.  If this style of reading is for you, this is an excellent book.  If you read for information or straightforward entertainment, there are plenty of better things to do with your time.	2000-12-15

This work as both strengths and weaknesses.  On the plus side, it is as extremely comprehensive and detailed treatment of non-relativistic quantum mechanics as can be found, and makes an outstanding reference work.  On the down-side, it took me half of the semester to learn how to find things quickly within the text, and I never felt as if it really helped me learn quantum in the intuitive sense.  While the mathematical formalism was there, the language CT used to describe these phenomena seemed lacking.  Fortunately, my copy of Sakurai helped me more with these less formal descriptions, and made a welcome complement to Cohen-Tannoudji.  While CT may be the most comprehensive text I have seen, I would not recommend it being the only text used for a class.	2000-12-15

First, the book is simply fun to read.  Stephenson has his own quirky style, which may put off some readers, but which I found enjoyable.  Spending a couple of pages reading about the proper way to eat Captain Crunch was not a waste of time!  For me, this book was a page turner.  Second, I found this book to actually be reasonably informative.  I came out of it with a better understanding of both cryptography (historically and modern), and a little more knowledge about WWII.  Third, the characters, while a bit stereotypical, were generally quite likable.<br />The book wasn't perfect - the moral issues were a bit too black and white, and the book was longer than necessary.  I found these flaws to be minor, and would recommend this book to any sci-fi fan.	2000-12-15

No book captures the essence of how I feel about my childhood than Leopold's i A Sand County Almanac.<br />Leopold is one of those who can perceive the story of a nation by observing a tree, or the very thoughts of the landscape around him.  His keen intellect, combined with a nearly unrivalled attention for detail, allows him to draw sweeping truths and passionate emotions from the most common occurances or objects.<br />Every winter, when I go home, I take a walk deep into the woods, far enough away to escape the sounds of bustling humanity.  And I listen.  Leopold and Thoreau are among the few authors whose writings reflect what I hear.	2000-12-14

The first chapters discuss the need for a person to accept responsibility for his or her situation if they are to have a healthy mental life.  The next few chapters deal with love, and the differences between real, meaningful love and its false analogs such as puppy love and dependency.<br />As the book went on, however, it grew more about spirituality, and less about psychology.  While not dead-wrong in his reasonings, I do feel Peck would have been better served to stick with his strengths.  The arguments in the second half of the book have been done before, and in far more convincing a manner than Peck delivers.<br />Overall, this book is average - though the first half would rate at least four stars.  If you are at all considering seeing a psychologist and want to know what you would be commiting yourself to, the investment of a few dollars and hours this book requires is well worth it.	2000-12-13

Outside of the Federalist Papers, no book is as essential to a American student of political philosophy as this. This book is neither a manifesto of the right or left - both sides can draw powerful arguments (and lessons) from this work.  Paramount to the book are the conflicts between equality and liberty, which today remains the core difference between the major political parties.  Toqueville also predicted the rise of America and Russia, as well as the growth of the central government - a hundred years before it became reality.  His praise of the American system of decentralized, voluntary associations is also dead on.  A wonderful book.	2000-11-28

The first is disguised as history, as Gould unearths the flaws of 19th-century cranology and early 20th intelligence testing and the biases of the scientists.  While making for fascinating history, this deconstructive process could be launched against any 'science', and amounts to little more than a diversionary strawman.<br />The second line of attack is stronger.  Dealing with the inherent difficulties in measuring intelligence (for example, what fraction of intelligence is mathematical?  verbal?  spacial?  musical?....how you weight the test will affect the scores of different people differently), Gould destoys the idea of an linear intelligence factor.<br />But...in reading this book, I got the same feeling I always get when enduring a post-modern deconstructive argument - that this line of argument can be used to refute ANYTHING, and that the author fears that he might not like the truth.<br />Overall, it is still a worthy book containing a succinct review of the history of intelligence testing and the associated prejudices of those behind the tests, as well as powerful arguments as to the dangers of taking intelligence testing too seriously.	2000-10-24

A few hundred scientists on Mars discover wildly optimistic technologies, while the billions of people on Earth decend into chaos, primarily because of those darn evil trans-nationals.<br />What started out as a balanced and interesting book jumped clear off the left end.

It provides a compelling, non-racist argument as to why the world's dominant culture arose on the Eurasian landmass.  The book is worth reading simply for this reason.

It succeeds on all accounts,  leaving the reader with deep insights into the nature of love and religion,  the causes of the Napoleonic wars, and the role of heroes in history.<br />The  large time investment in this novel is justified by what the reader takes  away from it.	2000-08-15
US	51924669	R1JYAY5ATKVX7W	038000741X	571510645	Monkey Wrench Gang	Books	4	1	2	N	N	Thoroughly enjoyable	This book was a pleasure to read from beginning to end.  While obviously  not a masterpiece of prose, the story and characters were memorable,  unique, and fun.  The setting was glorious, and described in words only  someone in love with it could write.  I recommend this book to everyone -  or at least everyone who has a deep respect for law and order, for this  book will give even the least radical among us the urge to create a little  mischief.  And as an added bonus, in reading this book you will learn a lot  about how to wreak havoc on your enemies.  What more can you ask? This  story is well worth the investment.	2000-08-15
US	51924669	R240YUH6ACH2RL	0140132708	903668876	Midnight's Children	Books	4	3	4	N	N	A worthwhile novel	Rushdie's Midnight's Children is sucessful on three levels.<br />First, it is an enjoyable read.  The imagery, style, and langauge are clearly first  rate, and highly remniscent of Garcia-Marquez.<br />Second, for a western  reader with little knowledge of Pakistani-Indian history, the book provides  a sweeping background of this important contentious region.<br />Finally, the  themes and ideas contained within the book, such as 'snakes and ladders'  and 'midnight's children', are often insightful and novel.<br />I was somewhat  disappointed by the good-guy/bad-guy allusions to contempory politics, but  overall, I felt that the knowledge and insight I gained from this book was  clearly worth the effort.	2000-08-14

The langauge varies from beautiful to impenetrable,  with allusions galore.  The themes were shocking in 1922, and portrayed in  all of life's gory detail.  But is it worth it?<br />The time involved in  reading (let alone understanding) this book is enormous, easily on the  order of fifty hours.  What does this steep admission price buy?  Simply  put, not enough.  Their are a multitude of insights one can draw from  Bloom's day, but their are none that aren't easier to gleen from other  writings.  The language, while beautiful at times, does not justify the  investment, in my opinion.  For a passionate lover of English langauge and  literature, this book may be for you.  But for the everyday reader, who  reads for simpler pleasures and knowledge, you will probably get little out  of this book but the right to say 'Yes, I have read Ulysses, Yes!'	2000-08-14

The story and its  essential questions are known to us all, but here they are delivered in  full, in the style of Homer.  The book is challenging, however.  The  langauge is dated, and the time investment is steep.  For anyone at all  interested in Christianity, either personally or historically, there are  few better ways to spend your time.	2000-08-14

Unlike the more modern writing  style in Neuromancer, the writing in Idoru is direct and clear.  The plot  is simple but fast paced, the characters likeable, the setting and ideas  purely Gibson.  The ending, of course, is excellent.  Definitely worth a  few bucks and a few hours.	2000-08-14

In a few hours of reading, one catches a fairly representative look into the scientific commmunity, though the eyes of one man.  Some people critique this book as being one-sided.  Of course it is!  Watson admitted that up front.  The book was written as an account  his perceptions of the events and people involved with the discovery of the  structure of DNA, not as a documentary.  Like any human, Watson's  perceptions of the events were scewed in his own favor.  This, however,  adds to the value of the book, rather than detracts.  From my experience in  the scientific community, the issues of ownership of ideas and work,  plagarism, and politics are both real and complex.  Double Helix does a  good job of exemplifying these difficult issues.	2000-02-25

Tolkien Boxed Set (The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings)	Books	5	0	0	N	N	There's a feeling I get when I look to the west	&quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; is far and away my favorite book, and my appreciation for it only deepens with each reading.  It is perhaps the only book where the setting is more important than plot or character - a setting so real that people cannot help connecting it with our own world. But LOTR  is not an allegory; it is simply a story.  Whatever 'ism' some feel that it  advocates is merely a reflection of an 'ism' the reader took to  Middle-Earth with them.<br />Ramble on....	1999-08-19
