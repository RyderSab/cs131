Fans who read High Fidelity will know that music plays a key role in the lives of his characters. In this work on pop culture, Hornby writes about 31 songs that have personally touched and moved him. Some of them are instantly recognisable pop gems, others obscure to even hardened lovers of indy music. But Hornby's strength is in his writing. He makes each song come alive, as he narrates not only a brief history of the song and the band but also why he likes it and most stunningly what the song sounds like. With this book, Hornby gives the phrase \\"his words were music to my ears\\" a whole new literal meaning.	2005-01-14

His \\"My Name is red\\" was a joy to read, full of wit and vivacity, ensuring a light-hearted flow through the most philosophical passages. His latest novel Snow on the other hand is a serious political novel, with nary a light moment in it. However, Snow is an extremely powerful novel of ideas that sheds light on Turkey's socio-political environment, caught as it is in the grips of modernity and fundamentalism. <br /> <br />In Snow, Ka a Turkish poet who has been living in Frankfurt for the last 10 years returns to his native land as a journalist, and goes to Kars a sleepy town rocked by a series of suicides by young girls. However, the real reason for his presence in Kars could be to reunite with his college day flame, now separated from her husband. Turkey has been polarised into two segments, those that want it to join the European Union and become westernised and those that want it to retain its fundamentalism. Caught in the crossfire, Ka finds himself politically uncertain but invigorated as a poet and lover. <br /> <br />Snow is a relevant and timely work of a master of contemporary world literature.  <br />	2005-01-14

In his earlier book Empire, he showed himself a staunch defender of britain's quest to colonise and dominate the world. In succint and convincing prose, he argues that America has taken on the mantle of `civilizing' the world. He argues that imperial control by a distant power is imperative for the development of an orderly socio-political structure in \\"new and untidy\\" countries.    He claims that America has failed in its duty as an Empire and has shirked its responsibilities. He accuses America of working on a nation-building process in many pl[aces but leaving before the building is complete.    While many readers might disagree and even be appalled by his arguments, Fergusson stakes a strong claim for America as an empire with a strong sense of humanity, clear head for long-term planning and most importantly accepting its role as the world's leading country.    Flawed as his arguments might be, they are persuasive, cogent and extremely relevant to the debate of America's role in the world today.	2005-01-14

Do you truly believe in the power of a book to change and improve lives? Azar Nafisi did. After resigning from the University of Tehran as a professor (following clashes with the authority over her refusal to wear the veil), Nafisi invited seven of her best students to attend a weekly study of the best literature in the confines of her study. There was one catch: the books they were reading and discussing were banned in Ayotollah's Iran. For two years the girls and their mentor met in secrecy discussing Nabokov, Fitzgerald, Austen and the harshness of their lives. <br /> <br />Reading Lolita in Tehran is as much literary criticism as it is the story of repression of basic rights. It is also the story of one woman's conviction in the power of books and their ability to raise the spirit. The book has is ultimately uplifting, with its quiet subdued humour. As one of the students says, after reading Pride & prejudice, \\"It is a truth universally acknowledged that a Muslim man, regardless of his fortune, must be in want of a nine-year-old virgin wife.\\" <br />	2005-01-14

The book has been over 3 years in the making and apparently, the first manuscript submitted by Dylan was all of one paragraph, with no punctuation. However, incisive editing and Dylan's wonderful narrative have resulted in a thoroughly witty and anecdotal story. Debunking a few myths, crushing a few egos, paying homage to many heroes and through it all he tells the story of a small town boy who just wanted to rock. Dylan confesses that he never aspired to be a role model or a flag-waving symbol of protest. <br /> <br />The book offers rare insights into the mind of a man who meant so much to so many. \\"I'd either drive people away,' he writes, 'or they'd come in closer to see what it was all about. There was no in between.' Speaking of some of his most inspired songs, he says \\" I could'nt understand where they came from.\\"  His fans can only wait eagerly for more.  <br />	2005-01-14

The novel starts with the opening (and immediate closing) of James' play Guy Domville. The author then retreats to Ireland to hide his humiliation. The Master charters Henry james path back to the limelight. The book is a deeply poignant and meditative study on a classic author who saw much success in his own age. Toibin, while chronicling James' time, trials and tribulations, shows how the events that shaped his life inspired his writing. In `The Master', Toibin pays glowing tribute to his own spiritual master in the art of writing. The Master is a serious piece of literary erudition that is a work of an author coming of age. This is Toibin's best work so far, and one of the most enjoyable serious books of the year.	2005-01-14

One day they discover the raped and mutilated body of Nurse Short Blonde (nicknamed so, for her hair). While the serial killer rapist remained elusive, C-Bird must now write down the facts on his apartment wall to quell the cacophonic voices in his head. How much of his ramblings are true?

Will in the world is not just the story of Will's life but also of 16th and 17th century England, the political upheavals, the religious intrigue and the social upheavals of the age. All of which, Greenblatt finds, have echoes in Shakespeare's works. <br /> <br />Stephen Greenblatt writes throughout in a light breezy and accessible style. With so little factual information to work on, and the life over four centuries behind, Greenblatt's work is part conjecture, part detective work and part fantasy.

Sinclair Lewis in 1935 wrote a book called `It Can't happen here' a cautionary tale about the rise of fascism in America. Philip Roth, probably the greatest living American writer today, has used the same idea to create a shocking and stunning tale of politics and repression in his latest novel, `The plot against America\\". <br /> <br />In Roth's \\"What If\\" novel, Charles Lindbergh defeats Franklin Roosevelt in the 1940 elections for the American Presidency. Lindbergh had crossed the Atlantic on a solo flight and public sympathy was on his side following the kidnapping and murder of his young son. Lindbergh was widely seen as the archetypal American. Brave, Handsome, Charming and above all, a Patriot. However, according to many sources, he was also a nazi sympathiser. Lindbergh assumes power and signs non-aggression treaties with Hitler and Hirohito and, it soon becomes clear, intends to enforce \\"the Nazi dogma of Aryan supremacy\\". <br /> <br />Roth a veteran of nearly two dozen books now, has written a timely and controversial book that is a thinly veiled and scathing attack on the American administration. The book's narrator is a young boy named Phil Roth. Yet Again, Philip Roth has written a novel of autobiographical fiction, being based as it is on his experiences as a young Jew in America during the war. Considering that the basis of this life has provided such stunning novels as the Zuckerman Trilogy, Portnoy's complaint & Goodbye Columbus among others, the reader is unlikely to complain. <br /> <br />In a year when most veteran masters have come up with mediocre offerings, Philip Roth's has provided us with his greatest work yet. And as the Guardian wondered recently, \\"isn't it time they gave him his nobel?\\" <br />	2005-01-14

David Maine has produced a modern masterpiece in what is one of the best books of the year so far. The Preservationist (or The Flood in the UK) is the story of Noah told from the perspective of his family, who are variously confounded, angered, excited, nervous or just plain stoic about his Holy orders.  <br /> <br />Maine's strength is his stunning portrayal of the women in Noah's life, viz. his wife & three daughter-in-laws. Clearly Maine loves his women and portrays them as storng characters without whom the men would fall apart ion shambles. And most of us know how true that is at any part of time or place. <br /> <br />This is a realistically funny, poignant story told with a great sense of good humour about it, and is bound to be of enormous interest irrespective of whether one is a believer or not. A strong recommendation to anyone interested in literary fiction.	2004-08-07

The charm of the book lies in the fact that it defies categorisation. It is Suspense, Thriller, Romance, Science-Fiction all rolled into one and yet the lyrical beauty of the prose takes it beyond all these genres. <BR>   All you need to know about the plot is what you read in the blurb, there is nothing more that one can say without unwittingly revealing the hidden layers, the person best equipped to do it for you is faber himself. An absolute genius with words, this is a fantastic novel that one can ony urge everyone to read with the greatest urgency, not merely for the joy it brings through sheer reading pleasure, but like only the greatest novels can, it makes us question what it means to be human.<BR>   Read and be thrilled. Read it especially if you like your novels with a dash of elegance and poetry.	2004-05-31

Somewhere between the gutter and the stars is the thin line between Sopa Opera and Epic. Capturing the best entertaining elements of a see-saw soap and the grandiose emotions of a classic epic Michel Faber's \\"Crimson Petal & the White\\" is a thorough entertainer. With all the dazzling elements of wit & humour, sex & romance, hate & revenge, faith & fanaticism, dementia & madness, this book is a roller coaster ride of emotions held in with the tight reins of Fabers fabulous wordsmanship. Faber is a truly great author as this book and his earlier superlative novel Under the Skin prove.<BR>The story of the Fall and Rise of Sugar, a prostitute who will do anything, as 'More Sprees in London' attests and how she rises from the back alleys of London is the stuff of pure pot boilers. This novel has drawn comparisons to Charles Dickens but that does not do justice to faber, who is a wonderfully talented artist on his own terms. His range and ability to keep his reader interested through near 900 pages is ample testimony to his capabilies. When finally after reaching 900 pages you wonder if the novel is, if anything, a trifle too short, the ending a trifle too abrupt.	2004-05-31
