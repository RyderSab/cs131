Let me use the \\"Ships\\" metaphor in a conventional business company.<br /><br />Consider you already have managers in your staff and are going to open a new venture - the network of supermarkets. There should be at least one talented manager for each supermarket. Some manager will be working properly, their supermarkets will be profitable but they won't yield any further development. Such people are calling \\"Silver Ships\\". Now consider people who are even in moderate ranks will act as self-motivating and self-organizing managers, able to infuse their ideas into the public mind, do things with small increments but finish them for sure. Such people are your \\"Golden Ships\\", with whom you should share leadership functions. Of course, there may also exist \\"Empty Ships\\" into whom you may invest lots of time, energy, other resources, but this would not pay off. You should definitely get rid of the empty ships, because they do not let silver and golden ships stand on their places.<br /><br />\\"Silver Ships\\" are good workers but do not expand your business. If your team will only contain of them, you will be profitable for a while, but your organization will lack flexibleness and won't be able to adapt to the quickly-changing condition of the modern world, and you will collapse sooner or later. \\"Golden Ships\\" are full of initiative, they don't need much external propelling force, and preoccupied with organizational flourishing, growth and change.<br /><br />Did you read in the management literature that it's the manager's business to motivate the employees, to keep their morale high, to make them love their job, and so on? If all of your colleagues are \\"Empty Ships\\", your efforts to motivate them won't bring any result and you will quickly loose your own passion. This is not the case with \\"Silver Ships\\", who consume your motivation fruitfully, but the level of energy you will spend on them will be less then what they will give to you, and your own motivation won't rise very high. Now imagine what will happen if you give your energy to the \\"Golden Ships\\", who already are capable of giving their energy to their mates. You won't need to spend enormous energy to motivate them, and they have already created enough motivation around them, or even turned some \\"Silver Ships\\" to \\"Golden Ships\\".<br /><br />The management literature which claims to teach how to motivate the staff won't help you if you are enclosed by the \\"Empty Ships\\". Such literature assumes that you always NEED something while your employees do NEVER want to do anything unless you stimulate of motivate them properly. Just get rid of these people and find someone who are motivated by the job and who are capable of motivating you. You may have tough times in your life and may not always have liveliness to motivate even yourself, when you NEED to motivate the staff according to this literature. This is wrong situation. You need to have such subordinates that will motivate you. Such subordinates have ideas and enthusiasm, while you have experience that you might want to share. Imagine how your motivation will will be raising when you are surrounded by the \\"Golden Ships\\". Just concentrate your efforts on attracting enough people of this kind around you, and they will be attracting good people around them.	2005-09-05

I should admit that the diet is very delicious. If you try to follow this diet specifically as it is written, without modification, you may find it too difficult, the recipes too time-consuming, and some ingredients hard to find in your area. Just feel free to modify this diet and make sure you do not go hungry.<br /><br />I also recommend you \\"The 20-Day Rejuvenation Diet Program\\" by Jeffrey S. Bland in addition to this book. Both books present diets very similar in nature, and you can combine the diets. Both of the books analyze which food is good and which is bad for the liver and for the body. However, you should devise your own eating style, because each person is biochemically unique.	2005-08-07

Bland educates you to take self-care in you eating. We consist of what we eat after all, right? <br /> <br />The major ideas on which this book is built are: plant foods and their constituents (phytonutrients) have helth-giving properties, diet and lifestyle can help reverse the aging process, and help overcome the effects of living in a toxic world. This book is about consuming raw legumes, vegetables and fruits, but it's not vegetarian - it contains lot of delicious recipes of meat, fish and so on. The book just explains how to balance the food to get enough phytonutrients and. <br /> <br />The major component of the Rejuvenation Program presented in this book is the 30-day Phytonutrient Diet with daily recipes and menu specifics. if you try to follow this diet specifically as it is written, without modification, you may find it too difficult, the recipes too time-consuming, and some ingredients hard to find in your area. Just feel free to modify this diet and make sure you do not go hungry. <br /> <br />The book contains fairy well explanation of the human body, the digestion process and the detoxifying properties of the liver, and how to help the liver and your entire organism to be healthier. Remember that the absence of disease does not guarantee the presence of health. <br /> <br />It analyzes which food is good and which is bad for the body. However, you should devise your own eating style, because each person is biochemically unique and this book acknowledge this.  <br /> <br />Personally me find the recipes of this book extraordinarily delicious.

The characteristics of the tyre still present a challenge to the natural philosopher to devise a theory which shall coordinate the vast mass of empirical data and give some guidance to the manufacturer and user. This is an inviting field for the application of the mathematics to the physical world. <br /> <br />This book is mostly devoted to mathematical models of the tyre: tyre brush model; the tread simulation model; the magic formula tyre model (semi-empirical); non-steady-state out-of-plane string-based tyre models (stretched string model, approximate models adapted bare string model); single contact-point transient tyre models (linear, semi-non-linear, fully non-linear, enhanced non-linear transient tyre model); short wavelength intermediate frequency try model (the contact patch slip model, brush model non-steady-state behaviour, the model adapted to use of the magic formula) <br /> <br />It also shows applications of transient tyre models: vehicle response to steer angle variations, cornering on undulated roads, longitudinal force response to tyre non-uniformity, axle motions and road unevenness, ABS braking on undulated road, anti-lock braking algorithm and simulation. <br /> <br />Besides to mathematical models of the tyre the book discusses tyre characteristics and vehicle handling and stability. <br /> <br />The final chapter is devoted to the motorcycle dynamics. <br /> <br />If you need a book less theoretical and more practical about tire, I recommend \\"Racing & High Performance Tire\\" by Paul Haney.	2005-07-23

Tracked vehicles such as a military tank or a bulldozer that is propelled by tracks instead of pneumatic tires are also covered in detail in this book. There is also attention to air-cushion vehicles (hovercrafts). However, the guided ground vehicles which are constrained to move along a fixed path, such as railway vehicles and tracked levitated vehicles are not covered in this book. <br /> <br />There is a very good chapter on the mechanics of pneumatic tires, which has both theoretical and practical information. Attention is also given to performance of tires on wet surfaces. This issue is frequently overlooked by the other vehicle dynamics books; however, the behavior of tires on wet surfaces is of considerable interest from a safety point of view, as many accidents occur on slippery roads. The tire is also analyzed as both spring and a damper. There are useful graphs and tables in this chapter, as well as throughout the whole book. The table of damping coefficient of tires shows that the damping coefficient of tire drops with increase of the inflation pressure. <br /> <br />Mechanics of vehicle-terrain interactions studies distribution of stresses in the terrain under vehicular loads, empirical methods for predicting off-road vehicle performance, a computer-aided method for evaluating the performance of vehicles with flexible tracks, and so on. <br /> <br />Performance characteristics are covered separately for road and off-road vehicles. For the road vehicles, the author analyzes equation of motion and maximum tractive effort, aerodynamic forces and moments, vehicle power plant and transmission characteristics, prediction of vehicle performance, operating fuel economy, engine and transmission matching and braking performance. For off-road vehicles, the author examines drawbar performance, fuel economy of cross-country operations, transport productivity and efficiency, mobility map and mobility profile, selection of vehicle configurations for off-road operations. <br /> <br />Handling characteristics of road vehicles and steering of tracked vehicles are also separately analyzed. <br /> <br />There is a very good chapter on vehicle ride characteristics and human response to vibration. <br /> <br />I also recommend \\"Race Car Vehicle Dynamics\\" by William F. Milliken and Douglas L. Milliken, which is also a good compromise between theoretical and practical information.	2005-07-23

Hw worked alone at first; then he gradually received contributions from to others, including - thought neither of them knew it in 1991 - Linus, whose Linux program would provide the last major pieces still missing from Stallman's huge software jigsaw puzzle. <br /> <br />The book covers the GNU project from its formal beginning, when in January 1984 Stallman started working on Bison, which was a replacement for Yacc. Having limbered up with this relatively minor task, he moved on to one of the most important. One of the key elements of a Unix system is the C compiler. After an unsuccessful attempt, he returned to Emacs and released GNU Emacs in September 1984. In October 1985 he has founded Free Software Foundation and then proceeded with C compiler and the C library. <br /> <br />The book then describes the biography of Linus, his years at the university and his work on his operating system, his experience with Minix, quite popular at that time in academic area, and fight with Tanenbaum, the author of Minix. The book then brings out the history of the development of Linux in detail. <br /> <br />Besides Linux, this book covers Open Source movement in Netscape, the development of TEX, Perl, Cygnus, etc., and how big companies like IBM adopt Open Source software and contribute to its development. <br /> <br />I would also recommend \\"The Cathedral & the Bazaar\\" by Eric S.

The second part guides through the practical applications of the skills of the left and right hemispheres of the brain, demonstrating how they can be used each separately, and how you can them combine them in specific ways that multiply the advantages you get from using your brain. The third part gives the set of recommendations for using \\"Radiant Thinking\\" and \\"Mind Mapping\\", to increase the precision and freedom or your thinking. The fourth part gives an overview of all the different intellectual tasks that can be tackled with Mind Maps: making choices (decision-making), organizing your ideas (note-making), organizing other people's ideas (note-taking), creative thinking and advanced brainstorming, improving memory and imagination, and creating a group mind. The fifth part introduces computer software for Mind Maps. <br /> <br />The author claims that brain functions traditionally associated with one side ofbrain reinforces functions of another part of brain.

Like other books by Tony Buzan, \\"Mind Maps at Work\\" starts with the description of human brain, its boundless capabilities, and then reiterates Buzan's favourite techniques like Mind Maps, TEFCAS, Radiant Thinking, etc. If you've read other books by Tony Buzan, you may find parts of this book monotonous, uninteresting and not engaging your interest. But if you are looking how to apply Mind Maps to your work environment, or just thinking how to be more efficient at your job, change career or start your own business, deliver excellent presentations with confidence, stand up for yourself and your ideas, be a key player at work, lead your team to excellence, than you will find worthy thoughts throughout this book. <br /> <br />It shows how to use Mind Maps and TEFACS to organize your business plan, access the progress of your plans and identify areas for improvement, create and update your CV in a colorful and visually arresting way, and so on. <br /> <br />Although in some places I've found this book a little bit dull, it is definitely worth attention!

This system of thought treats the eye as an ideal model which helps us to understand the speciality of human perception. To make the reader understand this reasoning, the author operates with many metaphors and vivid stories which are literary works of imagination.    The author tells that the sharp vision given by glasses or contact lenses has its cons. In the fog and vagueness of what is called \\"bad eyesight\\", there are new gates of perception, new thoughts and feelings, which would have been unable with sharp vision. This does not mean that the author makes excuses for bad eyesight. He just discourages from using lenses which narrow the sight and narrow the mind. When the eyesight is focused by the lenses, we are paying much attention to detail and cannot see the worlds as whole, we loose the holistic way of perception. If we understand that, we'll make the first step on the way of improving our eyesight.    To see, not to look - this is the main point of the book. Lots of people do look, but only a few do see. Transforming your habits to really seeing is a key to better, healthier and more exciting life. There are the following traits of a person who looks but not sees: gets up from the bed quickly, thinks about being in a bathroom as an unpleasant necessity, takes meals on the run, feels lack of real contact when meets with people, the thoughts about job and plans of paid occupation are always rolling inside the mind, the body always feels tired, don't make even morning exercises, or opposite, are too fanatic with fitness.    Seeing and social life is an important aspect of the book. The author analyzes the important phenomena of social myopia which leads to social disjunction.     Besides the philosophic and spiritual look to the eyesight, the author presents many scientific advises, habits and exercises to improve the eyesight and get rid of lenses. In addition to this book I hightly recommend \\"The Bates Method For Better Eyesight\\" by W.H. Bates and \\"Help Yourself to Better Sight\\" by M.D. Corbett.	2005-07-01

He reviews the features of human development that make possible the phenomena of leadership: humans' primate status, early socialization and so on. The author introduces a set of distinctions that figure in a cognitive approach to leadership: such factors as direct/indirect forms of leadership, leadership within and across domains, inclusionary/exclusionary kinds of stories, identity stories, the embodiment of stories, and resistances and counterstoreis.  The author identifies four factors crucial to the practice of effective leadership: a tie to the community (or audience); a certain rhythm of life (combination of being inside the fire and being able to do reflection in isolation); an evident relation between Stories and Embodiments; and the centrality of choice. <br /> <br />The following chapters are studies of leaders in different domains, based on the biographies of these persons and general histories of the period. The studies are interesting and noteworthy. <br /> <br />The drawback of the book is that the authors' framework is not quite easy to form an image of it in the mind, i.e. not quite solid. There may be sometimes not very easy to find the links between the framework presented in the first two chapters with the studies of the leaders from the remaining chapters. <br /> <br />I highly recommend the books by Ronald A. Heifetz: \\"Leadership Without Easy Answers\\" and \\"Leadership on the Line\\", which say essentially the same about leadership, but the framework of Ronald A. Heifetz is much more elegant and explained better in comparison with one proposed by Howard Gardner.	2005-06-29

The 6-D Model extends the Deming Plan-Do-Check-Act cycle by adding the ability to reveal risk and opportunity. The P2I2 is a cause-effect diagram that relates the factors influencing risk management capability, by distributing the task of managing risk according to four major factors: people, process, infrastructure and implementation. Using this divide-and-conquer approach, parallel efforts can speed the adoption of risk management within an organization. The Risk Management Map synchronizes these efforts by proving direction through five evolutionary stages: problem, mitigation, prevention, anticipation, and opportunity. <br /> <br />This book assumes that you already have risk management experience. It shouldn't be your first reading on risk management.	2005-06-25

The latter books have little practical value for a beginner racer, because 95% of their graphs and formulas are nowhere to apply.<br /><br />The author brilliantly uses his favourite style of describing complex topics in a form of interview with appropriate experts. There are very noteworthy discussions with tire compounders from Goodyear and Firestone, and the other tire experts. These interviews motivated the author to create the entire new book dedicated exclusively to the tire, as the most complex component of the car. I highly recommend \\"Racing & High Performance Tire\\" by Paul Harney in addition to this book.<br /><br />The chapter on shock absorbers is the best piece of information I ever read about dampers. It's very easy to understand, but covers every important aspect of a shock absorber: bump and rebound, single-and dual-tube design, cavitation, emulstion and gas-bag shocks, washer stacks and external adjustments, different valve types,  high-speed vs low speed damping, shock dynamometer, and so on.<br /><br />The book finishes with a very impressive interview with Carroll Smith, the author of \\"Prepare to Win\\" and the respective titles. Carroll answers such complicated questions there like what are the two things that the best drivers feel much better than the mediocre drivers: \\"It's real simple. They're feeling two things. One is the slip angle of the tire, and the other is the self-aligning torque of the tires, on all four tires\\".	2005-06-19

The top teams were spending between $20 and $140 million in Eighties, and now they spend much more. They can create a complete engine, electronics, chassis, carbon fiber this and that. But the one thing they can't make is tires. This is the main point of the book. <br /> <br />This is a historical overview of GoodYear tires in competition events from 1902 to 1992. <br /> <br />The title \\"Tire Wars\\" is a little bit misleading, because the book fails to adequately cover competing tire manufacturers and the wars themselves. The book mostly exclusively covers GoodYear tires and motor sports events were GoodYear won, without comparison with the rival tire companies. <br /> <br />This book describes the evolution of GoodYear competition tires without engineering details. It mostly covers racing events rather than tire technology data. However, the book is of great historical value. It is very interesting to read and have many noteworthy photographs. <br /> <br />If you would like to read an adequate coverage of tire wars, I would have recommended \\"Racing & High Performance Tire\\" by Paul Haney.	2005-06-18

While there is no single model for business incubators, in most cases the concept goes beyond the simple provision of a shared office or workspace facility for small business clients. The hallmark of any effective business incubator programme should be its focus  on the added  value that it brings to small business 'tenants' in terms of strengthened business skills; access to business services; improved operating environment; an opportunities for business networking, etc. to nurture early-stage small businesses, increasing their prospect for business survival and growth, compared with the situation outside the incubator. <br /> <br />In this book, Colin Barrow, the Head of the Enterprise Group at Cranfeild University School of Management, and Director of the Business Growth and Development Programme in the UK, gives very deep analysis of business incubators and gives the large list of incubators throughout the globe. The main questions of these book are \\"how business incubators work and does it work at all\\", \\"why there is a need for incubators\\", \\"what is the history of incubators and where we are now\\", \\"who goes in for incubation\\", \\"is incubation right for you\\", \\"how long should a tenant stay inside the incubator\\", and so on. <br /> <br />The case studies in this book are mostly based on e-business and software companies. I would also have recommended his book \\"How to Survive E-Business Downturn\\" in addition to this book.	2005-06-16

You will see how the inability to processing data in correct way can slow down the development of a particular service or product. And you will see how distributed data can bring new horizons. Take fixed or cellular operator as an example. Lots of improvements have been postponed just because there was no correct billing software ready. There are many real world examples in the book to support the author's idea. All these examples are very noteworthy.

Although the practice of disaster recovery emphasizes restoration from outages and disruptions, this book is not intended to be a book on disaster recovery, Instead, it discusses hot to design survivability and performance into a network, using conventional networking technologies and practices, and how to create the ability to recover from a variety of problems. The author tells you what to look out for and what to keep in mind, and discusses the benefits and caveats of doing things a certain way. <br /> <br />The book doesn't specify individual technologies, products and solutions. It looks at the big picture and emphasizes higher-level architectural strategies. <br /> <br />This book is about network continuity. It is the ability of a network to continue operations in light lf a disruption, regardless of the origins, while resources affected by the disruption are restored. In contrast to disaster recovery, network continuity stresses an avoidance approach that proactively implements measures to protect infrastructure and system from unplanned events, using techniques in distributed redundancy, replication, and network management, to create a self-healing environment. <br /> <br />The book starts with principles of continuity in generic terms: fault mechanics, redundancy, tolerance, topologies, etc. Another chapter is devoted to metrics and measurements like recovery time objective (RTO), recovery point objective (RPO), mean time to failure (MTTF), exposure metrics, cost metrics, risk/loss metrics, performance metrics, and so on. The following chapter list basic networks topologies like star, mesh, ring, bus, etc. There is a chapter devoted to clustering, load balancing, switching and redirection. As about continuity, there are separate chapters devoted to network access continuity, software application continuity, storage continuity and continuity testing. <br /> <br />Each chapter throughout the book is completed by a references section, which points to various magazine articles. <br /> <br />I also recommend \\"Resilient Storage Networks\\" by Greg Schulz in addition to this book.	2005-06-02

Such networks are able to provide business continuation in the event that a significant disruption occurs. While there are other publications available like \\"Mission-Critical Network Planning\\" by Matthew Liotine, \\"Resilient Storage Networks\\" mainly focuses to storage media and ways to access it.  <br /> <br />The first chapters of the book are generally educative: they cover various treats and requirements for data protection, data storage fundamentals, i.e. what is a bit and what is a byte, etc. Then it proceeds to storage networking access models and I/O interfaces. A large part of the book is devoted to fiber optics: cabling types, connectors and transceivers, link loss and power budgets, protocol drop, etc.  <br /> <br />There are different schemes and illustrations that will help you to choose, at a higher level, to categorize the information that you store, and to build the best kind of network for it: small storage network, consolidation and intermix, metropolitan and wide are storage networks, large and high-performance networks, etc. <br /> <br />This is a very friendly and easy-to-understand volume. It is vendor-neutral and doesn't specify individual products and solutions. It looks at the big picture and emphasizes higher-level architectural strategies, based on existing network protocols, access models and interfaces.	2005-06-02

Then it analyzes ways of protection from different failures at various levels: documents, applications, OS, Storage, CPUs, network, power and building. <br /> <br />Throughout the book there are references to various products and services of different vendors. When the author recommends certain software, there are attempts to suit three operating systems: Windows, OS X and UNIX. <br /> <br />In the chapter about storage corruption, there is an interesting section about SMART (Self-Monitoring, Analysis and Reporting Technology). I personally use SMART to monitor temperature of my HDDs. But I've found an inaccuracy in the description of the differences between SCSII and IDE. The author claims that \\"OS just says to SCSII 'Give me a file', and SCSII delivers it, whereas with IDE the OS deals with fragmentation of files\\". This is incorrect. SCSII doesn't' work on file level, and OS deals with fragmentation at SCSII as well. <br /> <br />The information in this book corresponds year 2000 approximately, it mentions IDE size limit of 137GB and speed limit of 33 MBps (Ultra DMA Mode 2). <br /> <br />The drawback of this book is lack of coverage of collaboration tools like CVS or Subversion as very efficient backup tools. These tools are very easy to use at client side, although their server side is somewhat difficult to install. <br /> <br />The intended audience of the book is very broad, and the style is very simple so even a computer novice can understand this book.	2005-05-31

This book was what I missed for a long time. Here is something what I've learned from this paperback: <br /> <br />In the early days of automobiles, safety was virtually unheard of. For example, until the late 1940s automobiles used plate glass in the windshield and side glass. Early motor vehicle is little more than a speeding gas can with a sofa mounted on it. These cars used cotton batting, mohair and natural fibers to upholster and insulate the interior. These early vehicles would smolder, ignite and sustain a flame quite well. Much like the upholstered chairs or sofas found in the home, something as simple as an errantly discarded cigarette would ignite the material into a giant blazing inferno. <br /> <br />Starting with the history of automotive safety, the book proceeds to contemporary cars, which consist of materials virtually inflammable, unless exposed to any kind of fire accelerant. Almost every substance of earth contains carbon in some form. If subjected to a high enough level of heat, pretty much everything will burn. Items thought to be not flammable such as steel and concrete become flammable if exposed to a 7000F (3500C) fire.  <br /> <br />Describing fire behavior basics, the books analyzes burning characteristics of exhaust system and underhood flammable liquids like gasoline and diesel fuel, power steering fluid, transmission fluid, hydraulic ride fluid, brake fluid, coolant, engine oil, windshield washing fluid. Ignition capabilities of air filters and fuel injection system is also analyzed. The book conduct an in-depth inquiry of electrical system and fire: battery, alternator, started motor, HVAC, engine ignition coil, electrical switch, solenoids, wiring looms, fuse and relay panel, etc. <br /> <br />Targeted to fire investigators, the books describes engineer's principal job to determine if there exists a primary failed part which could have caused an operational mode fire, and to find arson indicators, since deliberate arson is a crime. The most common mistake ca perpetrator makes in deliberate arson is that a copious quantity of flammable liquid is splashed around the interior or the engine compartment and then ignited. The result will be a burn pattern which will be obviously greater than the available fuel load. The book completes with the chapter \\"Engineer in the courtroom\\", which describes proper investigation techniques, scene photography, forensic tools, subrogation issues, arbitration and the superior court action. <br /> <br />I don't have a CD-ROM which seems to accompany this book.	2005-05-28

It doesn't cover a lot of enhancements to enterprise data management in the following areas: high availability technologies, additional backup and restore capabilities, and replication enhancements; scalability advancements such as table partitioning, snapshot isolation; database encryption, and an enhanced security model; new management tool suite. <br /> <br />Programmers will find what was added to SQL language: ranking functions like Row_Number, Rank, Dense_Rank, NTile; new data types; the specific use of WITH clause; SOME, ANY and ALL operators; EXCEPT and INTERSECT set operators; PIVOT to create a cross-tab table; exception handling by TRY...CATCH; and other additions to SQL. A big chapter is devoted to XML integration. You will also find a lot of information about Common Language Runtime (CLR) Integration, the ability to develop database objects using any .NET language.  <br /> <br />Other object models and services are also covered: data transformation services, server management objects, native HTTP SOAP, notification services and reporting services.

It is a collection of ready recipes that you might have known about, but not always apply to practice. Each recipe usually contains one or two small case vignettes.  <br /> <br />I can call this book \\"the encyclopedia of leadership\\" - the items cover almost the entire area leadership, and the items are small enough to review them quickly. <br /> <br />The drawback of this title is that it doesn't seem to cover problems and tough issues of leadership that always arise. To fill this gap, I can recommend the unique framework by Ronald Heifetz described in the books \\"Leadership Without Easy Answers\\" and \\"Leadership on the Line: Staying Alive Through the Dangers of Leading\\". <br /> <br />When the authors look to the leader in context of the organization, the view is a little bit mechanistic: \\"focus on clear standards, set the goals to keep on track, etc\\". I do not complete share this mechanistic view. Of course, leaders are important, but I agree with Margaret J. Wheatley who says that organizations are living systems. They are like people, intelligent, creative, adaptive, self-organizing and meaning-seeking. The simpler way to organize human endeavor requires a belief that the world is inherently orderly. The world seeks organization. It doesn't need humans to organize it, it doesn't seem to share our desires for efficiency or neatness, it uses redundancy, fuzziness, dense webs of relationships, and unending trails and errors to find what works; life is intent on finding what works, not what's \\"right\\"; life creates more possibilities as it engages with opportunities; life is attracted to order. I can recommend the book \\"Leadership and the New Science\\" by Margaret J. Wheatley. <br /> <br />There are the other aspects of leadership that should be scrutinized in much greater detail, but they definitely exceed the size of the single book. \\"The Leadership Challenge\\" is an excellent work, but don't stop on it, keep reading the other leadership and self-development books.	2005-05-15

The mechanistic image of the world doesn't help us any longer. We keep exploring what we can see when we look at life and organizations using different images.  <br /> <br />Organizations are living systems. They are like people, intelligent, creative, adaptive, self-organizing and meaning-seeking. The simpler way to organize human endeavor requires a belief that the world is inherently orderly. The world seeks organization. It doesn't need humans to organize it. <br /> <br />The book is based around the following essential ideas: everything is in a constant process of discovery and creating; life uses mess to get to well-ordered solutions, it doesn't seem to share our desires for efficiency or neatness, it uses redundancy, fuzziness, dense webs of relationships, and unending trails and errors to find what works; life is intent on finding what works, not what's \\"right\\"; life creates more possibilities as it engages with opportunities; life is attracted to order; life organizes around identity; everything participates in the creation and evolution of its neighbors. <br /> <br />\\"A simpler way\\" is to a great extent influenced by Maturana and Varela, Kelly, Prigogine, Jacob, Lewontin, Kauffmann and other great thinkers. <br /> <br />Here is the quote from this book: <br /> <br />\\"In their work on human cognition, Maturana and Varela explain that, at any moment, what we see is most influenced by who we have decided to be. Our eyes do not simply pick up information from an outside world and relay it to our brains. Information relayed from the outside through the eye accounts for only 20 percent of what we use tocreate a perception. At least 80 percent of the information that the brain works with is information already in the brain. <br /> <br />We each create our own worlds by what we choose to notice, creating a world of distinctions that makes sense to us. We then \\"see\\" the world through this self we have created. Information from the external world is a minor influence. We connect who we are with selected amounts of new information to enact our particular version of reality. <br /> <br />Because information from the outside plays such a small role in our perceptions, Maturana and Varela note something quite important for our activities with one another. We can never direct a living system. We can only disturb it. As external agents we provide only small impulses of information. We can nudge, titillate, or provoke one another into some new ways of seeing. But we can never give anyone an instruction and expect him or her to follow it precisely. We can never assume that anyone else sees the world as we do. <br /> <br />Their work on human cognition underscores the realization that we are all, always, poets, exploring possibilities of meaning in a world which is also all the time exploring possibilities.\\" <br /> <br />I also recommend \\"Leadership and The New Science\\" in addition to this book.	2005-05-14

The author proclaims that the brain is by far the most important organ in the baby's body, explains the functions of left and right brains, and enumerate the intelligences: verbal, numerical/logical, engineering/spatial, sensual, body/kinaesthetic, creative, personal, social and spiritual. The writer explains the importance of these intelligences in the baby's life, and helps the parents to develop them: each section ends with \\"Things For You To Do\\" list of practical advices for parents. <br /> <br />Great attention is also paid to the importance of physical development, as it is also important for the growth of the brain in the first two years of the child's growth, as well as to the good nutrition. \\"When we think of food, we traditionally think only of standard nutrition. Good standard nutrition is, though, only of four necessary brain foods. Each of these brain food is equally important and is totally necessary for your baby to survive, without any one of them he will die.

While the audience of this hardcover is health care professionals, I, not being a medic myself, found this work pleasant to read and easy to understand  <br /> <br />Much of the theory of REBT was derived from philosophy rather than psychology. Dr. Ellis has read many works of ancient and modern philosophers before devising this framework. REBT is cognitive, emotive, and behavioral, and is not by any means strictly \\"intellectual\\". REBT states that is not an adversity (A) that negatively affects the human but the belief (B) of the individual about this adversity, that leads to negative consequences (C).

REBT states that is not an adversity (A) that affects the human but the belief (B) of the individual about it, leading to negative consequences (C). These are the simple but most important ABCs of the therapy.<br /><br />Dr. Ellis encourages disputing the irrational beliefs, avoiding generalization and absolutism, and unconditionally accepting self and the others.<br /><br />Here is an excerpt from the book: \\"Exceptionally bad occurrences are only awful, horrible or terrible when you define them as such. Bad never really means awful but you may think it does. And you never have to think in that self-destructive way. In fact if you think clearly, you'll soon see that nothing - no, nothing - is awful. [.....] When you insist that an undesirable event is awful or terrible, you are implying - if you're honest with yourself - that it is as bad as it could be: completely or 100% bad. Bu actually nothing can be 100% bad, because it invariably could be worse. If you are tortured to death slowly, you could always be tortured to death slower. About the only thing that could really be totally bad would be the annihilation of the entire human race, all the living and non-living things that now exist, and the whole universe. Well, that hardly seems likely in the near future. Even if our entire universe were to be annihilated, that would be most unfortunate but not really awful for several reasons: (a) We all ultimately will die anyway, (b) Once we were destroyed, we wouldn't know that we were non-existent, (c) It is sad that many species - like tyrannosaurus Rex and the dinosaur - no longer exist, but is it really awful? (d) If you view possible or actual human (or animal) annihilation, as awful, how will that help you stay alive or be happy?\\"<br /><br />Although Dr. Ellis has published more than 40 other self-help volumes, you can consider reading another book which is more brief and concise.

Although much have been written about dumpers in the other books, nowhere the dumpers have been covered so well as in this book, from design, construction, production, testing and using, to the analysis of ride-handling compromise. It covers the damper both as the unit per se, and as a small yet vital part of the whole complex vehicle system.    Please note that the information in this book is mostly academical and abstract. It servers educational purposes excellent, but has little practical value for a beginning racer or automotive enthusiast. The chapter about damper testing covers mostly laboratory tests on special machines. The chapter about fluid mechanics analyzes different damper fluid properties, without reference to any specific particular fluid compound. The chapter about valve design lists various valve types, characteristics and various theoretical models of valves. The chapter about adjustable damper enumerates the purposes of adjustment, classifies the dampers by the ease of adjustment, and gives different adjustable valve types. Having great theoretical value, the book however gives no advice for those people who would like to modify a damper manually by installing different kinds of valves, using another liquid, etc.    Millikens in their wonderful volume \\"Race Car Vehicle Dynamics\\" have devoted 40 pages to dampers, but almost all on vehicle behavior, rather than damper design itself. \\"The Shock Absorber Handbook\\" reveals the problem of passenger comfort better than the Millikens' work. However, both of the books have similar style, both have hundreds of formulas and illustrations. I highly recommend it to anybody interested in the theory of vehicle dynamics.	2005-04-22

This SAE Special Publication is a collection of papers from the \\"Tire and Wheel Technology\\" session of the 1999 SAE International Congress and Exposition. The papers are authored by researchers at DaimlerChrysler AG, Cabot Corporation, Iowa State University, Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Michelin Americas Research & Development Corporation, and others.  <br />Subjects covered include: Wheel balance weights; Lighter steel wheels; Mathematical Tire model, Tire cornering properties; Tire rolling resistance; and Dynamic properties of tires.  <br />As about the wheels, there is an interesting paper that describes the design development of a new steel wheel which utilizes spokes to provide either weight or strength benefits over a conventional dish center wheel. A 1.5 to 2 kg weight saving per wheel and the resulting 6 to 12 kg reduction in vehicle weight is a very attractive outlook. Another paper describes the method of testing the fatigue of distinct parts of a steel wheel using laser. It can help to reduce the weight of the disc to up to 40% with no stiffness degradation. <br />As about the tires, these papers would be indispensable addition to the books like \\"Race Car Vehicle Dynamics\\" by William Milliken and Douglas Milliken.  <br />I also recommend publications from other SAE congresses and expositions, to be in touch with current advancements in automotive technology.	2005-04-22

Great deal of attention throughout the book is paid to suspension behavior, weight distribution and the smoothness of the driver's movement. What I liked most in the book is the advise to use left-foot-braking during the transition from braking to acceleration and vice versa. This helps to avoid excessive suspension fluctuation and provides slow, smooth weight transfer. It is good to use this technique for RWD cars and even better for FWD cars. The author gives an exercise:  <br /> <br />\\"Accelerate to thirty mph. As you reach the point where you wish to brake, start to apply braking pressure with your left foot, and at the same time, lift your right foot slowly off the accelerator Increase your braking pressure to reach ten mile per hour at the pylon. As you pass the pylon at then mph, reapply accelerator pressure, and start releasing braking pressure.\\"  <br /> <br />The author states that the tire is the most important part of the car. I agree with that, and recommend you to read \\"Racing & High Performance Tire\\" by Paul Haney. <br /> <br />In addition to this book I recommend the \\"Secrets of Solo Racing\\" by Henry Watts.	2005-04-17

The tire is the most important part of an automobile, and the least covered by the literature. That's why any information about tires is a treasure. The  complexity of the structure and behavior of the tire are such that no complete and satisfactory theory has been propounded. Books on vehicle dynamics are available but they are mostly written by academics who emphasize mathematical rather than clear explanation of how things really work. The tire might be the most useful and complicated device humans make, but the tire manufacturers provide no useful information to their customers. People are forced to buy tires mainly on the basis of price and company reputation. Even race teams get tire data only sporadically, and that data is pretty useless anyway. Tire performance is necessarily highly dynamic, but tire data comes mainly from testing under static conditions.     This book describes basic properties of components of the rubber compound, carbon black reinforcement, and so on. It also shows mechanical model for rubber: \\"If you apply a cyclic force the rubber will deform mostly like a spring and give back the force applied to it, but also partly like a damper which is sensitive to the speed (frequency ) of the applied force\\". The book breaks rubber friction into adhesion (molecular bonding) and mechanical keying (deformation friction). Mechanical keying becomes more important when the road surface is lubricated by dust, water or ice; here is where another interesting property of rubber, viscoelasticiity comes into play. \\"Press your thumbnail into a street tire and the rubber rebounds. Press it into a racing tire and the mark stays there, recovering only slowly. This is a simple but crude test of hysteresis, or energy loss, in rubber\\". The book analyzes surface texture effects on rubber friction - how the slope of the asperities affect friction, and \\"the myth of off-line in the rain\\". Tire behavior is another major issue of the book.    The last 75 pages of the book(chapter 11) are not directly about tires, and devoted to \\"Basic Vehicle Dynamics\\", in case if you don't have an appropriate book on that topic, e.g. \\"Race Car Vehicle Dynamics\\" by Milliken Bill and Doug.    I also recommend \\"Mechanics of Pneumatic Tires\\". It is a PDF that you can freely download from the publisher's website using an internet search engine. This PDF is an excerpt from \\"Theory of Ground Vehicles, 3rd Edition\\" by J. Y. Wong.	2005-04-03

If you were missing deep theoretical background on tuning your sports car or street car, this volume is for you. It is impossible to describe in detail what this textbook is about, in a single review.    What I liked most is the chapter on dampers (shock absorbers). It gave me the answers to lots of questions that I had before reading this published work, for example how to choose \\"ride/handling compromise\\" when adjusting damping ratio? Why stiffer dampers are more comfortable on large-amplitude bumps, while softer dampers provide smoother ride on small-amplitude bumps? \\"In an automobile, a suspension is used to reduce the discomfort induced by unevenness in the highway. As measure of discomfort is the vertical acceleration that the passenger is subjected while sitting in the vehicle\\". The book demonstrates the model where the passenger is linked to the road via three springs in a sequence: tire, coil and the seat, and one damper (shock absorber). There is a graph showing passenger vertical acceleration depending on the amplitude (frequency) of road irregularities, for distinct shock absorbers with various damping ratios. For a stiff shock absorber this diagram shows relatively flat curve, where the vertical acceleration is almost independent of frequency of bumps. For the soft shock absorber, there is a very high peak (several times higher comparing to a stiff damper) of vertical acceleration for the low-frequency bumps, and this acceleration curve quickly decays as the frequency increases. There is another graph, \\"transient load transfer analysis\\", which shows that with soft dampers, the suspension load in a turn fluctuates. This is another answer to the question why stiffer dampers (to a certain extent) provide better handling.    The order of the chapters is somewhat sporadic. The books is a mixture of sections of engineering information (formulas), historical background, sketches (e.g. torque arm rear axle suspension), recipes (KONI's published instructions for damper adjustment), and sample data (e.g. Goodyear tire data). Nevertheless, the work is so deep that in a couple of years after it's publication, it had been started being used as a university textbook. Based on comments from faculty, SAE have requested the authors to prepare a supplementary book of problems, to help the universities to examine the students.    I also recommend \\"Theory of Ground Vehicles\\", by J. Y. Wong, in addition to this book.	2005-04-03

For example, you will find pros and cons of left-foot-braking in this book, as expressed by the champions in respective areas. All the interviewees have agreed that trail braking is much more important for FWD cars, or even unavoidable. <br /> <br />There are also good chapters about FWD cars in the following books: <br />- Competition Driving (Alain Prost, Pierre-Francois) <br />- Race Car Vehicle Dynamics (William Milliken, Douglas Milliken) <br /> <br />What the book lacks is a clear conclusion, an outcome (probably a final chapter) based the on the data gathered by the interviews.	2005-03-27

The author has devoted 9 pages to it, and exposed the \\"Shifty-Hand\\" and \\"Zaccone\\" methods. <br /> <br />The author writes that on higher-speed slaloms (series of pylons set in a line), you may need to be lifting the throttle or tapping brakes bit to get the car to do what you want it to do. I fully agree with the author. Someone can argue that constant throttle application is better to not upset the car. Throttle lift during slaloms is tricky to coordinate and will require practice to become expert. When you've found the limit with constant throttle application and cannot go faster, the throttle lift will give some additional mphs. For example, for a straight line of pylons at the distance of  25m (82 ft) the maximum speed of  a FWD stock 1500 kg (3306 lb) car with constant throttle application is about 65 km/h (40 mph) and is around 80 km/h (49 mph) when using throttle lift. That's a big difference. When the car is at its speed limit, with constant throttle application, the front wheels tend to scrub, the car tends to understeer. With throttle lift, the rear wheels are sliding all the way around the slalom, but the grip of the front wheels are perfect, they always point to the direction of travel, that is what we need, the car overseers here, but it is OK. <br /> <br />Another important advise that the author gave is to hit the apexes. \\"Even if you are sure that the car will not go to the apex, turn inand hit the apex\\". <br /> <br />This is a very good book. It has a glossary, a bibliography and an index. <br /> <br />I would also recommend \\"The Front-Wheel Driving High Performance Advantage\\" by Jack Doo, Carroll Shelby in addition to this book.	2005-03-27

For example, there is an advise in the book \\"to follow the slalom of direct line of pylons with constant throttle application\\". This is quite inefficient. What is much better upon my opinion is to release the throttle (or even press brake lightly for slow turns) on straight to transfer ahead the weight of the car, wait until the front suspension gets loaded, rotate the steering wheel to make the car enter the turn, and then apply throttle while you are unwinding the steering wheel exiting the corner. Any beginner who takes autocross courses, two hours daily, will be able to effectively apply this \\"brake-steer-throttle\\" technique on 5th or 10th lesson. <br /> <br />What I recommend is \\"Secrets of Solo Racing: Expert Techniques for Autocross and Time Trials\\" by Henry Watts.	2005-03-24

This book may be interesting for a motor sports beginner or just for a fan of competition driving. It is a quick glance throughout the Formula 1 world, yet a valuable source of information for a beginning racer or for someone interested in improving the driving skills. I've found the quality of print of this book is perfect, it has lots of very high-quality colour photographs. <br /> <br />Of course the book traditionally begins with the correct driving position and the handling of the steering wheel, both in Formula 1 car and in a rally car; then the authors proceed to braking and the correct use of the engine. <br /> <br />When it comes to choosing the perfect line, the authors reiterates the three-graded scale to categorize the corners by importance, originally published in 1971 in \\"Driving in Competition\\" by Alan Johnson, the 4-time SSCA National champion. But Alain Prost and Pierre-Francois Rousselot do not mention that it was Alan Johnson who has created this categorization, and they give no references or bibliography section in their book. According to this scale, the most important corners are leading to the straight, less important are followed by the straight, and the least important are corners that come between the other corners. <br /> <br />Unlike the other books on competition driving, this one pays attention to all three types of transmission when it comes to controlling car at the limit: the rear-wheel drive, the front-wheel drive and the four-wheel drive. I've found this chapter with the comparison of three transmission types very interesting. The authors explain the behaviors of different transmission for both slow corners (below 60-75 mph, or 95-120 km/h) and fast corners. <br /> <br />If you need a book about competition driving, a book with liveliness and variety, a book that you won't find boring, choose this one.	2005-02-21

Mastering the Art of Race Driving	Books	4	59	60	N	Y	The Best Manual of a Beginning Competition Driver	I couldn't \\"swallow\\" this book at once, it took me three sessions during a couple of months to figure out that amongst the good books on motor sports this one serves the role of a guidebook, of a manual of a beginning competition driver, best of all.  <br /> <br />What do I mean by \\"good books\\"? Competition Driving by Alain Prost, The Technique of Motor Racing by Piero Taruffi, Driving in Competition by Alan Johnson, Sports Car and Competition Driving by Paul Frere, to name a few. All of them are wise and not overcomplicated, and have no buzz about the success stories of champions, the buzz which is useless for the reader interested in driving techniques. <br /> <br />I've found out that the definition of oversteer and understeer here is the most complete and most correct amongst the books that I've listed, yet without the formulas that may frighten somebody. It took the author 17 pages full of illustrations to explain these modes of car behaviour. This is the first big advantage of this book.  <br /> <br />Another major advantage of this book is the serious attention of the author to the role of hardware, which is sometimes overlooked by the other writers, who claim that hardware is important, but do not write in-depth chapters about it. The book  has may illustrations and explanations how the center of gravity, wheel base, and the suspension elements like springs, shock absorbers and the roll bars affect longitudal and lateral load transfer speed and motion, which occurs during acceleration, braking and cornering; how various adjustment affect the weight applied to each of the wheels, and how this affects car behaviour. He is the only author to mention the effect of download on coefficient of friction of the wheel, and why the total friction of the wheels is at its highest level when the download on each wheel is the same, i.e. the car is balanced. The other writers in this case did only mention that to keep the car balanced is important without a sound explanation. <br /> <br />The book has an appendix with the listing of racing resources, it has a good bibliography and a useful glossary and an index. <br /> <br />I highly recommend this book, although sometimes I had a feeling that more humour and liveliness would have made it even better. Please also consider buying \\"Skip Barber - Going Faster\\" DVD in addition to this book.	2005-02-20

Such advices are: <br /> <br />- If you don't have something to say, don't say it - not all e-mails deserve responses; <br />- Use internationally recognizable dates, and measurements when appropriate. (Is 3/9 meant to be read as March 9 or September 3?); <br />- Don't post \\"Action or Else\\" messages if action is irreversible; <br />- Use \\"For Your Information Only\\" tags (to the messages that require no action) to help others manage their e-mail volume; <br />- Don't forward messages without adding your own note to tell the recipient why; <br />- Keep one topic in each e-mail <br />However, some of the author's suggestions seem to fit only dumb e-mail clients. Such suggestions are \\"highlight responses in colour to aid reading\\" or \\"cut and paste rather than big Reply on long, continuing e-mails\\". The e-mail clients like \\"The Bat!\\" that naturally support quoting have these problems already solved, the quotes there are automatically highlighted and you can type your reply paragraphs between the original text without being afraid of messing the lines. <br /> <br />The author encourages composing clear, to-the-point messages. She proposes to highlight the readers' action, to not be cryptic, and to not remove the actors. By examples she helps to create informative subject lines that get quick responses and help readers prioritize. <br /> <br />Seven pages of the book will tell you how to manage high-volume e-mail effectively. \\"Use last-in-first-out, group read later emails into a file and out of sight\\". I would recommend the book \\"Getting Things Done: The Art of Stress-Free Productivity\\" by David Allen who addresses the issue of stress-free e-mail management much better than Dianna Booher. <br /> <br />In the chapters about writing onthe paper or online, she proposes so-called \\"Descending Outline\\" and the MADE format (Message-Action-Detail-Evidence). <br /> <br />She also mentions the \\"idea wheel\\" outlining method to arrange your thoughts, which is a simplified technique of Tony Buzan's \\"mind maps\\". I would like to recommend you \\"The Mind Map Book\\" Tony Buzan and the other books by this author to maximize your brain's untapped potential. <br /> <br />A major chapter of this book is devoted to English grammar. You have probably learnt this at school, but a good repetition should still be helpful. The other big chapters are devoted to layout, clarity, conciseness and style, own chapter per each of the points. I will be working further on these grammar, clarity, conciseness and style chapters, and will be for sure re-reading them in future.	2005-02-18

In our rush to accept the many benefits of the silicon chip, we have abdicated our responsibilities. We have let the inmates run the asylum. When the inmates run the asylum, it is hard for them to see clearly the nature of the problems that bedevil them. When you look in the mirror, it is all too easy to single out your best features and overlook the warts. When the creators of the software-based products examine their handiwork, they overlook how bad it is. Instead they see its awesome power and flexibility. Programming is such a difficult and absorbing task, that it dominates all other considerations, including the concerns of the users. Programmers aren't evil. They work hard to make their software easy to use. Unfortunately, their frame of reference is themselves, so they only make it easy to use for other software engineers, not for normal human beings. Why high tech products drive us crazy and how to restore the sanity? This is what this book is about. <br /> <br />Because it is far cheaper for manufacturers to use computers to control the internal functioning of devices than it is to use older, mechanical methods, it is economically inevitable that computers will insinuate themselves into every product and service in our lives. This means that the behaviour of all of our products will soon be the same as most obnoxious computers, unless we try something different. The incredible power of computers means that few people can afford to ignore them. Even if you don't have a desktop computer, you probably own a VCR and an ATM card, which are software-based products. It is unrealistic to simply say you \\"won't use computers\\". They aren't just getting cheaper; they are getting ridiculously cheaper, to the point of ubiquity and disposability. Many familiar products that we imagine as mechanical (or electronic) are no longer made withoutcomputers. Cars, washing machines, televisions, vacuum cleaners, thermostats and elevators are all good examples. <br /> <br />This book is written with humour, liveliness, and amusement, it has a lot of funny illustrations. Yet it reveals the problems of software industry which were left attention for decades. One of the problem is \\"elastic user\\", such a user which must bend and stretch and adapt to the needs of the moment. When a company speaks about the software it develops, every party involved (management, programmers, testers, sales) include different meaning into the word \\"user\\". In \\"Goal-Directed design\\", the participants never refer to \\"the user\\". Instead, they refer to a very specific individual: \\"a persona\\". To create a product that must satisfy a broad audience of users, logic will tell you to make it as broad in its functionality as possible to accommodate the most people. Logic is wrong. You will have far greater success by designing for one single person. Imagine that you were designing an automobile to please a wide spectrum of people. You could easily identify at least three subgroups: the soccer mom, the carpenter, and the junior executive. Mom wants a safe, stable vehicle with lots of space and big doors for hauling the kids, dogs, groceries and other stuff. The carpenter wants a rugged vehicle with all-wheel drive and abundant room for ladders, lumber, bags of cement, and tools. The young executive wants a sporty car with a powerful engine, stiff suspension, convertible top and only enough room for too. If we make such a combination vehicle, what a goofy, impossible car will appear! Making three different products in software is lot easier than making them in steel, too. Another problem which the author points to is \\"the customer-driven death spiral\\", where \\"conceptual integrity\\" is the only solution. <br /> <br />The author declares that the key to solving the problems is interaction design, and exposes the Goal-Directed design method that provides manufacturers of high tech products with an insightful understanding of their users and a practical blueprint for a superior result. Alan Cooper, the author of the book, and his company, have designed a wide range of products ranging from clean, simple kiosk systems to complex scientific applications, controls for consumer-oriented computer peripherals, conceptual designs for entire product lines, eCommerce sites. The list of companies that adopted the Goal-Directed design includes many industry leaders, large and small, such as 3M, Proctor & Gamble, Dolby Labs, Fujitsu, HP, Informatica, Logitech, SAP, Charles Schwab, St. Jude Medical, and Varian. The description of Goal-Directed design in this book is very reader-friendly and is targeted to the broad audience. Alan Cooper gives the further explanation of this method in his following book \\"About Face 2.0\\", aimed mostly to the engineers. Although these two books are still not enough to deploy this method in your organisation, they show how vital this technique is for a successful product.	2005-01-30

The writer finds analogies between survival as a solder in Vietnam war and survival as a driver of a car on public roads in the U.S (and in the other countries as well). The main point of this book is situational awareness: what is the difference between a relaxed person, unaware of the surroundings (so called condition white), and the relaxed, aware one (condition yellow)? When the people describe their car accidents, they tell that everything were OK but suddenly something bad happened that caused the accident. \\"Suddenly\\" is the key word that presents in almost each accident description. It confirms that the victim of the accident was unaware of the surroundings, being in the condition white.     The author writes: \\"No excuses are asked or accepted. Someone hit you while you were stopped at a traffic light. It was the other guy's fault. That's no excuse. Your car is still damaged, and you could still be dead. If you are in the hospital, and the emergency room is working to save your life, \\"It wasn't my fault!\\" doesn't mean a thing to them. Right now it doesn't mean anything to you, either.\\"    The writer presents a concept of the \\"invisible car\\", which I liked much! Being invisible just means going with a flow, not standing out, driving smoothly and unremarkably, watching everything that is going on that affects you, avoiding the crazies and not \\"punishing\\" them.    An advise that impressed me deeply was not to behaves foolishly in your own nest. That's how the author explains this: \\"I'm constantly amazed at the bad driving habits exhibited by people within sight of their own garages. Soon all your neighbors know you are a jerk:.. Even if you drive like a total maniac, measure a couple of miles from your house and declare a truce there\\"    The author expresses a strong argument for wearing the seatbelt: If you are kidnapped, fasten your seatbelt and look for an opportunity to cause a collision at speed 30 to 40 mph (48-64 km/h). The criminal probably won't fasten his seatbelt and will be incapacitated or killed, but you will be in good enough shape to open the door and exit. This case happened several years ago in the city where I live to confirm the author's statement.    A big inconsistence of the book is that the assertion that the method of passing the wheel through your hands (also known as \\"shuffle\\") is far superior than the hand-over-hand technique. There are chapters in the book about spin correction and recovery, the bootlegger hairpin turn (180-turn), and the Moonshiner's turn (reverse 180-turn). The inconsistence is that the effective spin control and the Moonshiner's turn are hardly possible with the \\"shuffle\\" technique, which is slow. If you send me a video clip of this turn where the driver uses such technique for Moonshiner's turn, I'd be grateful. As soon as you never keep your arms statically crossed, the \\"hand-over-hand\\" method is good for both smooth city driving and extreme evasive maneuvers, because of the faster movement from lock-to-lock (left to right extreme) and immediate precise return of the wheels to the straight position.     There is also the information in the book that the speedometer doesn't work in reverse, which is not true for the modern cars with electronic speedometers.    The author also encourages visiting two-day advanced driving schools. I don't recommend attending such schools because two the days are not enough to acquire permanent habits to react correctly in tough cases. Good exercises, when effective, give strong physical and emotional stress to the student, and require a couple of days to recover before the next lesson. An hour or two per exercise should be enough; there is no need to spend the whole two days. So I suggest finding such courses that give at least 10-20 lessons during a month or two.	2005-01-21

Books	5	7	10	N	Y	Solid non-fiction framework with fiction illustrations	Before reading this book, I had no answer to the question why the children of rich parents are rich and the descendants of poor people are poor, and why poverty is eternal while broke is temporary. I didn't know why rich persons quickly recover from bankruptcy while poor people even winning millions in a lottery sooner or later revert to the poverty again. <br /> <br />This is the first book I ever read that clearly and briefly provides the response to the question. What differs rich from poor is not how they earn their money but how do they spend their money. Rich people spend all the money on money-generating assets, and the rest is kept for luxury like big houses or nice cars. Luxury is merely a reward for a high cash flow from the assets. Not enough money comes from the assets - no luxurious toys. Poor is the opposite - they buy liabilities like a big house and a powerful car which besides mortgage and credit payments require a big sum of money to upkeep them. Thus the poor class is always in debt and is deprived of money required to purchase the sources of income. <br /> <br />The most of the case vignettes of the book are fiction, and the author warns not to follow them literally but to use them as a source of inspiration and imagination and always use your own brain and your own judgment. Do not treat this book as the author's biography, as it may have seemed so. When I read a chapter about the childhood of mr. Kiyosaki and his  next-door playmate, Mike, I've found so much interest, stimulation, liveliness and variety in this section that I've instantly realized that it is a literary work of imagination. <br /> <br />Because of the author's excessive mixture of real names and thought out cases, some people may conclude that mr. Kiyosaki is trying to trick or deceive them (e.g. \\"John T. Reed's analysis of Robert T. Kiyosaki's book Rich Dad, Poor Dad\\"). Please do not think this way about \\"Rich Dad Poor Dad\\", just treat it as a solid non-fiction framework with fiction illustrations.	2004-12-11

This scale is often cited by the modern writers like George  Anderson (A Race Drivers Handbook) and Ross Bentley (Speed Secrets). Alan Johnson is considered the classical author and is often mentioned in the \\"references\\" or \\"recommended reading\\" sections of the modern published works on competition driving.<br /><br />Most of motor sports champions are eager to publish volumes about their career, illuminating the bright point in it, being reluctant to teach which underlying techniques made them outgo their competitors. This publication is not the case. It contains analysis and examination of competition driving in quantities sufficient for a novice to enter the subject yet enough not to frighten the beginner. Although the book contains the topics about formal automotive associations and about getting your competition license which are somewhat outdated since the last edition published in 1976, it may be of great historical interest. The book is also jam-packed with photographs of competition cars of Fifties, Sixties and Seventies, which big retrospective worth.<br /><br />This book is the friendliest title on competition driving I've ever seen! This is probably first textbook you might want to read on this subject! As an example of the friendliness, the author managed to explain such perplexing terms as \\"understeer\\" and \\"oversteer\\" in the most concise and clear way ever possible (however he has used the term \\"slip angle\\" in the explanation of \\"oversteer\\" without previously defining what \\"slip angle\\" is).<br /><br />If you need a deeper book about competition driving, I recommend \\"Sports Car and Competition Driving\\" by Paul Frere, but don't get frightened by formulas that might seem obscure from the first sight, Paul Frere is also a clear writer!	2004-11-22

It is written in a very friendly tone, clear language! It begins with a large chapter about the driving position; there are lots of photos with the right and wrong poses, with analysis of each case. The evolution of the correct driving position is also exposed. Then goes a chapter about power, torque and when to change the gear to achieve different goals: fuel economy, engine lifetime, maximum speed. After that there is a section about the correct braking and pedaling. <br /> <br />The author has dedicated a large topic of this book to quick and safe cornering, explaining the forces and vectors that act upon the axes and wheels; about the oversteer and understeer, about slipping, sliding and skidding. There are very simple and clear formulas to calculate the total adhesion of a wheel with the road.  <br /> <br />The rest of the books is about the sport events: how to prepare and how to perform. Should the generic reader be aware of the contests, right? <br /> <br />The detailed reading of the book has shown some arguable points. For example, the author is glorifying the ABS in one chapter and writes about controlled slide in another chapter, not mentioning the controlled slide is hardly possible with ABS. It seems that the textual fragments which were added in the second edition of the book about the modern whistles-and-bells like ABS are not well aligned with the rest of the book (that's why four stars only) which Paul Frere has published in the first edition, and this original text about physics of cornering is just brilliant!  <br /> <br />However, if you liked a better book about cornering and not filled with much information about sport events, I would have recommended numerous textbooks by Professor Tsygankov, who has even a separate textbook about the correct handling of the steering wheel. This subject is almost overlooked by Paul Frere.	2004-11-21

The main issue of this book is that we by ourselves are diminishing our daughters' abilities by upkeeping the dogmas about women that we've inherited from our parents. Examples of such beliefs are that girls are not good in sciences like math, are never possessing the necessary skill or talent to become a skilled professional in traditionally male (and thus higher paid) occupations. The differentiation of professions by gender is a dogma by itself.    The beginning of the book is quite noteworthy, the middle of it seemed to me to consist repetitions of previously said and kind of dull, but the ending of the book seemed deserving attention again.     The advises or the book couldn't be equally applied to all the cultures. Being an American author, Nicky Maroon had exposed the American gender gap that is deeper than it is in Russia, where Soviet Power since the beginning of 20th century took many efforts to gain the complete equality and liberty of women. Just estimate Lenin's publications on the status of women, or judge Olympic results. Former East Germany, the Soviet Union, and the Former Communist Bloc dominated women's running in the 70s and 80s, taking nearly 70% of the final placement points in those two decades in Olympic and world championship races.	2004-09-04

The rest four parts lack this satire and are a little bit boring. However, I've found some noteworty quotation for my thesis \\"Image of a Manager\\" when I was working on in in the university. Also, the author writes how he dealt with journalists, and I've found it interesting.    The book not presents a case study of a company innovation but describes the history of IBM in nineties. For example, the author explains in detail why OS/2 was cancelled and why did they buy Lotus and didn't buy other companies.    It's very exciting to read how the CEO has diagnosed the problems of the company and which solutions did he find.    I would also recommend \\"Leading the Revolution\\" by Gary Hamel. It is a very serious examination on how companies innovate and why should they do it, with lots of remarkable examples. Gary Hamel uses plain friendly language.    The books of Chris Argyris about organizational learning are also about innovation. Although the language style is \\"academic\\", the books are interesting and somewhat unique.	2004-06-04

It is also a well-written scrutiny of the American system of higher education from the perspective of 1986. <br />(I should admit that the book is a sewed hardcover and manufactured with very high quality)<br />The author questions &quot;the belief in knowledge for its own sake&quot;, and admires with the colleges where the faculties have formulated common goals and work collaboratively to achieve them. This concept is called &quot;competency-based learning&quot;, where the students are primarily developing effective communication skills, improving analytic abilities, strengthening problem-solving capabilities. Competency-based learning is opposed to memorizing nomenclatural raw data that the students will soon forget if they won't use this data on day-to-day basis. <br />Throughout the book, the author emphasizes on the imperative of measurement of the quality of learning, and shows the difficulties of such measurements: how can it harm the education by orienting it too heavily to fit the measurements.<br />The author shows pros and cons of the American system compared with Italian, German, French and British systems. Admitting the lack of adequate means of measurement here as well, the author judges that the number of foreign students entering American universities may be a trustworthy mark to conclude that the American system is nevertheless the best. The author doesn't take into consideration that these foreign students may use American universities as an opportunity to enter the wealthy job market of the U.S.<br />Interestingly, in 1986, the computers were extremely expensive and did only start to invade the field of education. Nevertheless, the attitudes of the author towards computers were very optimistic. The author did envision that computers will revolutionarize learning, although he admits that &quot;...technology has raised great hopes on several occasionsin the past only to disappoint its backers. Thomas Edison once predicted that the phonograph would revolutionarize teaching, and, several prominent foundations and corporations spent large sums in a futile effort to bring radio and later television into widespread classroom use. In each case the new technology foundered because it cost too much, aroused the opposition of teachers, and failed to deliver the pedagogic gains that it enthusiasts had promised.&quot;	2003-08-16

In addition to the obviousness that sex is joyful and exciting experience that enriches one's life, the authors evidence benefits of sex for physical and mental health in numerous references to scientific researches (the endnotes section has 160 references). The authors, however, do not mention that sexual aversion seriously affects one's social life by diminishing charm.

The author gives a lot of remarkable case studies throughout the book to illustrate his view.<br />The author shows that in order to survive, the company should have the right strategy and keep careful eyes on it, the concrete mission, the clear vision of the perspectives, the definitive goals and the business plan. The author shows five stages of growth of a company (with IBM as an example) and tells how to survive the transitions. Most of the companies fail to survive the first transition.<br />With various examples, the author shows that nothing kills the business as fast as the attempts to do many distinct things simultaneously, and emphasizes the importance of aligning the vision of the key players of the business. Those members of your organisation should be in charge of writing the business plan who take accountability of the outcomes of the plan that they have written.<br />The author also empasizes on the teamwork and the employee motivation as the imperatives of a success of any business.<br />I would also recommend &quot;What Management Is&quot; by Joan Magretta and &quot;Leading the Revolution&quot; by Gary Hamel in addition to this book.	2003-03-15

Their method suits for a baby from zero moths old, i.e. from birth. The are three lessons a day, each lesson last fifteen seconds and give such a joy to the baby that she woke me up in the mornings asking me to teach her math. When she hears my steps when I return from my job, she runs to me to teach her math. The babies CAN and WANT to learn!<br />The babies are eager to learn, they want desperately to learn everything they can, as quickly as possible, but the adults are often fail to provide for the babies the adequate opportunity of learning.<br />Glenn Doman and Janet Doman offer funny and inexpensive way of teaching the baby math, by means of special inventory: cards with red points indicating a real quantity.<br />A few words from my own experience on producing the inventory: don't even imagine of cutting the cards or the points by yourself. Order the empty cards of the specified size in a nearby company, which prints business cards. Order five thousand 0.75-inch sticky red circles on a roll of ORACAL in a nearby company, which decorates the shop windows. The authors do not emphasize on ORACAL, but the process of putting the circles to the cards should be as easy as possible.	2003-02-14

The authors are mainly interested in productive organizational learning: how this kind of learning can be generated in real-world organizations and how practitioners can help to foster it.<br />The theory given in this book is primarily based on two types of learning: single-loop and double-loop. The authors have borrowed the distinction between single and double-loop learning from W. Ross Ashby's &quot;Design for a Brain&quot; (1960). <br />On case studies of known companies, such as Intel, General Motors, etc., the authors show &quot;primary inhibitory loops&quot; that inhibit organizational learning, and &quot;conditions for error&quot;, and how to avoid them. The following list gives the most common &quot;conditions for error&quot; and how to avoid them:<br />- Vagueness : Specify<BR>- Ambiguity : Clarify<BR>- Untestability : Make testable<BR>- Scattered information : Concert<BR>- Information withheld : Reveal<BR>- Undiscussability : Make discussable<BR>- Uncertainity : Inquire<BR>- Inconsistency/incompatibility: Resolve<br />In part I, the authors introduce the conceptual framework, both for organizational learning and for the relationship between research and practice. In part II, they introduce and illustrate concepts central to limited learning. Part III presents a brief classroom-based example. Part IV is the review of the recent history of the field of organizational learning.<br />Despite of the brilliant content, the book which is marked as &quot;Reprinted with corrections August, 1996&quot;, which I have (paperback), is awfully printed. It is really the eye-killer. And nevertheless, it has some typos. Please try to find a version which is not &quot;Reprinted with corrections August, 1996&quot;.	2003-01-27

This book is very valuable if you already started to practice Extreme Programming. It contains a very encouraging foreword by Tom DeMarco. The first nine chapters are introductory, and you may skip them if you read the XP Manifesto &quot;Extreme Programming Explained&quot; by Kent Beck. Chapters from ten to twenty three contain valuable information not found in any other XP-related book.<br /> - How exactly to plan releases? What if frequent releases aren't appropriate and marketing demands to release once a year?<br /> - How exactly to write user stories, and how to handle them? Although the reader may find some sample stories in &quot;Extreme Programming Installed&quot; by Ron Jeffries, Ann Anderson and Chet Hendrickson, the stories in the &quot;Planning Extreme Programming&quot; are used as core elements in the whole planning process, shown as example.<br /> - How exactly to build the iteration plan and the release plan? How to track an iteration?<br />I would also like to recommend &quot;Extreme Programming Applied: Playing to Win&quot; by Ken Auer, Roy Miller, Ward Cunningham. I think this is the most practical book on XP ever written.<br />I would also like to recommend the titles about individual XP aspects:<br />- Design Improvement: &quot;Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code &quot; by Martin Fowler;<br />- Test-Driven Development: &quot;Test Driven Development: By Example &quot; by Kent Beck;<br />- Sustainable Pace: &quot;Slack: Getting Past Burnout, Busywork, and the Myth of Total Efficiency&quot; by Tom DeMarco;<br />- Pair Programming: &quot;Pair Programming Illuminated&quot; by Laurie Williams and Robert Kessler;<br />- Whole Team: &quot;Agile Software Development&quot; by Alistair Cockburn;<br />- Planning Game: &quot;Planning Extreme Programming&quot; by Kent Beck, Martin Fowler;<br />- Small Releases: &quot;Software Project Survival Guide&quot; by Steve C McConnell.	2003-01-06

This may lead to impression that studying the parts is the key to understanding the whole (things are taken apart, dissected, and then put back together without any significant loss).<br />Now in the brilliant work &quot;Slack&quot; the author has taken much higher leverage, focusing to organization as a whole, but not forgetting about people and interactions. The writer shows that what is critical is the relationship created between two or more elements. Systems influence individuals, and individuals call forth systems.<br />The entire idea of the book is &quot;slack&quot;, and how essential is it for health and growth of an organization. <br />While Brooks' most compelling idea was about the myth of a man-month, Tom DeMarco tells about the myth of fungible resource.<br />Dom DeMarco does not avoid his traditional thoughts that &quot;Hurry Up&quot; really means &quot;Slow Down&quot; and the cost or pressure. The first two parts of the book are related to these problems.<br />The whole part Three of the book is dedicated to &quot;Change And Growth&quot;. Part Four is about &quot;Risk And Risk Management&quot;, where Tom DeMarco shows how vital is risk management to any organization.	2002-12-26

It tells in practice:<br /> - How to introduce XP, how to overcome managers' and developers' resistance, how to set the right attitude (Part One);<BR>- How to remember XP core values, how to handle exceptions if something has broken, e.g. the customer won't write stories or the number of developers is odd, how to do pair programming or stand-up meetings, how to steer and how to plan the whole project and the individual iterations, how to write tests, to create the pair-friendly space, how to refactor, and how to reduce the risk (Part Two);<BR>- How do design the simple, what collective ownership means, how to automate acceptance tests and not get distracted by the code, why the overtime is not the answer and how to coach and keep the score (Part Three);<BR>-How to &quot;sell XP&quot; (commercial aspects of XP projects, e.g. how to bill the customer), how to &quot;scale XP&quot;, and how to &quot;measure XP&quot; (Part Four).<br />Enough said, this is the most practical book among all the XP books ever published.	2002-12-26

Weathley brings parallels between the theory of leadership and the quantum physics. Being an organizational consultant, not the physical by herself, she <BR> encourages &quot;to stop seeking after the universe of the seventeenth century and begin to explore what has become known to us during the twentieth century&quot;.<br />She exposes the bright conclusions from her experience of working as a consultant, and these conclusions are confirmed by quantum physics as well:<br />- The things we fear most in organizations - disruptions, confusion, chaos - need not be interpreted as signs that we are about to be destroyed. Instead, these conditions are necessary to awaken creativity.<br /> - What is critical is the relationship created between two or more elements. Systems influence individuals, and individuals call form systems.<br />- There is no objective reality; the environment we experience does not exist &quot;out there&quot;. It is co-created through our acts of observation, what we choose to notice and worry about.<br />- Acting should precede planning.<br />- Instead of the ability to analyze and predict, we need to know how to stay acutely aware of what's happening now, and we need to be better, faster learners from what just happened.<br />- We need fewer descriptions of tasks and instead learn how to facilitate process.<br />- Power becomes a problem, not a capacity. People use their creativity to work against these leaders, or in spite of them; they refuse to contribute positively to the organization.<br />- Those who have used music metaphors to describe working together, especially jazz metaphors, are sensing to the nature of this quantum world. This world demands that we be present together, and be willing to improvise.<br />- If a manager is told that a new trainee is particularly gifted, that manager will see genius emerging from the trainee's mouth even in obscure statements. But if the manager is told that his or hernew hire is a bit slow on the uptake, the manager will interpret a brilliant idea as a sure sign of sloppy thinking of obfuscation.<br />- In quantum world, what you see is what you get.<br />- Every time we go to measure something, we interfere.<br />- A place where the act of looking for certain information evokes the information we went looking for - and simultaneously eliminates our opportunity to observe other information.<br />- Every observation is preceded by a choice about what to observer.<br />- We all construct the world though lenses of our own making and use these to filter and select.<br />- It simply doesn't work to ask people to sign on when they haven't been involved in the planning process.<br />- Roles mean nothing without understanding the network of relationships and the resources that are required to support the work of that person. In this relational world, it is foolish to think we can define any person solely in terms of isolated tasks and accountabilities.<br />- What is distinguishable and important, he says, are the kinds of connections. <br />- Our old views constrain us. They deprive us from engaging fully with this universe of potentials.<br />Based on the parallels above mentioned, Margaret J. Weathley brings lot of compelling ideas about the leadership and organizational management. This book isn't a collection of dos and don'ts, but invigorates deep creative thinking.	2002-12-20

The first part covers basic usage of e-mail, and can be helpful for e-mail newbies. However, if you've sent ten thousand messages so far, it is unlikely that you find anything useful there.<br />The author has dedicated the second chapter of the book to business writing. It is mostly a set of dos and don'ts, without deeper analysis. I recommend separate, deep books on business writing and correct use of English. The author, has also given a list of references that include &quot;The American Heritage Book of English Usage&quot; by Editors of The American Heritage Dictionaries, &quot;The American heritage Dictionary of the English Language&quot; by Editors of The American Heritage Dictionaries, &quot;Alphabet to Email&quot; by Naomi S.

Besides that, it shows in various examples and case studies that globalization aspects should be taken with care to avoid cultural, legal, technical and linguistic traps and pitfalls. <br />However, not all of the advices should be taken literally, because they can be the author's guessing, not experience. An example is the advice to use Unicode characters to display textual language selection menu in a global gateway web site. Rather than merely not displaying the characters of fonts not installed on a user's computers, a web browser may offer the user to download and install all the fonts needed to properly display all of the characters used on the page. Thus, the North American user will need to download fonts for Traditional Chinese, Kanji and so forth. The user may however choose to skip downloading fonts, but the question dialog box may nag the users, but the author writes nothing about this.<br />The book tends to expose problems, rather than to focus on solutions, because the solutions in this particular topic (web globalization) may quickly become outdated. Thus, the book encourages the reader to do further research, and offers references to companies that provide translation services and software for web content-management frameworks with globalization support.	2002-12-01

This book is for both professional web-site development companies and for the customers who would like to order web-site development from a contractor. The book offers new way of developing web projects. The mode of operation is based on the famous methodology called &quot;Extreme Programming&quot; (XP). Until publication of this book, all of the non-compilation books on XP have come from those who were involved in its birth. This publication is the first title from the &quot;second generation&quot; of XP practitioners.<br />This book is self-essential. However, if you would like to know more about economic and spiritual aspects of XP, digest the &quot;Extreme Programming Explained&quot; by Kent Beck. Another valuable resource is &quot;Testing Extreme Programming&quot; by Lisa Crispin &amp; Tip House. It exhibits valuable web testing strategies.<br />While the authors mostly rely on XP manifesto, they have adjusted the methodology to best fit their own needs. For example, they offer so-called zero-iteration, which sets up the framework, but have no business value to the customer. The parents of XP discourage this approach in &quot;Extreme Programming Installed&quot; by Ron Jeffries, Ann Anderson and Chet Hendrickson. Who are right? You decide.	2002-12-01

It brings lot of valuable patterns: Test-Driven Development Patterns, Red Bar Patterns, Testing Patterns, Green Bar Patterns, xUnit Patterns and Design Patterns. Despite the book &quot;Design Patterns&quot; seems to be provisioning, design in test-driven-development requires a slightly different look at design patterns, and Kent Beck has done his best in providing not only the common vocabulary, but a gainful technique not known to be described anywhere else before.<br />Before the publication of this book, there was a lack of a good manual for xUnit testing framework. The title &quot;Testing Extreme Programming&quot; by Lisa Crispin and Tip House, released a couple of month before this book, didn't fill the gap. This book is the first significant guidebook for xUnit ever released. While the work &quot;Extreme Programming Installed&quot; exposes most valuable testing experience among other XP titles, it didn't focus on xUnit as well.<br />I would recommend &quot;Design Pattern&quot; and &quot;Refactoring&quot; in addition to this book, assuming that you are aware of the XP manifesto: &quot;Extreme Programming Explained&quot;.	2002-11-30

The author provides deep analysis why such a big number of software projects fail. The author offers a set of reality-testing tools (software project survival test) that helps to understand chances of a project to success or to fail, from the very beginning.<br />An intriguing idea is that &quot;software project need hierarchy&quot; is essentially the same as Maslow's &quot;human need hierarchy&quot;: human beings respond to a hierarchy of needs that involve a natural progression from lower motives to higher ones. Lower motives such as food, air and water must be satisfied before we can be motivated by the need for belongingness, love, self-esteem or self-actualization. Similar hierarchy of needs applies to software projects.<br />The author clearly shows that the outcome of any project depends equally on both the customer and the project team, and on the way of their communication and cooperation.<br />Showing the power of process and distinguishing &quot;process&quot; from &quot;thrashing&quot; and &quot;productive work&quot;, the author doesn't decline that the people are always important.<br />Another cunning idea presented by the author is &quot;The Cone of Uncertainty&quot; which means &quot;early in the project you can have firm cost and schedule target, or a firm feature set, but not both&quot;.<br />While by no doubt the first part of the book &quot;The Survival Mind-Set&quot; is an excellent theoretic inspection, the remaining, practical parts of the book are questionable. I'd recommend you to take them skeptically, and, before taking decisive action, getting the full picture by reading &quot;Agile Software Development&quot; by Alistair Cockburn to get the overview of the modern methodologies, &quot;Extreme Programming Explained&quot; by Kent Beck as an example of such methodoloty, &quot;Peopleware&quot; by Tom Demarco &amp; Timothy Lister to make sure that the good workplace and the jelled team is a major factor, &quot;Quality is Free&quot; by Philip B.

The book will invigorate the testers who never worked in XP environment to start doing this practice. The book starts with an introductory overview on XP, which is self-contained and should be easily understood by any tester, unless he or she has prejudices against XP. This introduction is helpful for those who inherently would like to use XP. The skeptical readers should first take attention to Kent Beck's \\"Extreme Programming Explained\\".<br />For those who don't like to imagine of someone in the tester \\"role\\" on an XP project, the authors encourage to think of having a programmer with a \\"tester focus\\". The authors define the tester role to fill the communication gap between the user and the programmers.<br />For those who are already practicing XP, this book should be a good repetition of the core XP practices. If you like to refresh in memory the essential aspects of XP, read this book. The authors give their own vantage point on XP, which compliments the original Kent Beck's idea. <br />This book also contains the introduction to some automated test tools like JUnit (a testing framework for Java) or JWebArt (an HTTP-based web testing tool). However, the JUnit introduction given in this book won't help great deal to the C++ programmers, because the CppUnit, the C++ testing framework, have sufficient differences from JUnit. What the XP community who work with C++ really miss at the date of publication of this book is a good CppUnit manual.<br />The book also have essential focus on story estimation and iteration planning, from the tester's perspective. However, from the programmer's point of view, this book contain very few useful ideas. The programmers might want to refer to Ron Jeffries' \\"Extreme Programming Installed\\" for some useful testing strategies, tips and tricks.	2002-11-21

The effectiveness of the business is determined by how well we do that data transmission.<br />In the same year when the Bill Gates's book was published, Philip Crosby exposes his own case studies entitled \\"Quality and Me: Lessons from an Evolving Life\\".	2002-11-16

It is of vital importance for any Open Source Project participant to understand the philosophy of the Open Source and be aware of the history of the movement. <br />However, the book does not reach its goal, Managing Open Source Projects. The book title is misleading. The core two chapters, Managing a Virtual Team and Managing Distributed Open Source Projects aren't practical and not very deep. <br />The final chapters are a quick glance on tools and technologies for building Open Source Projects.<br />The information given in this book is not enough to start and manage an Open Source project. This book however may be helpful for anyone wanting to contribute to an existing Open Source project.	2002-11-09

But after reading the book, I found out that that Glenn Doman and Janet Doman have discovered the completely different method of teaching a baby math, not the same that is using in junior schools. Their method suits for a baby from zero moths old, i.e. from birth. The are three lessons a day, each lesson last fifteen seconds and give such a joy to the baby that she woke me up in the mornings asking me to teach her math. When she hears my steps when I return from my job, she runs to me to teach her math. The babies CAN and WANT to learn!<br />The babies are eager to learn, they want desperately to learn everything they can, as quickly as possible, but the adults are often fail to provide for the babies the adequate opportunity of learning.<br />Glenn Doman and Janet Doman offer funny and inexpensive way of teaching the baby math, by means of special inventory: cards with red points indicating a real quantity. <br />A few words from my own experience on producing the inventory: don't even imagine of cutting the cards or the points by yourself. Order the empty cards of the specified size in a nearby company, which prints business cards. Order five thousand 0.75-inch sticky red circles on a roll of ORACAL in a nearby company, which decorates the shop windows. The authors do not emphasize on ORACAL, but the process of putting the circles to the cards should be as easy as possible.	2002-11-09

We are scapegoating people in authority for their inability to quickly fix our problem without bothering us or involving us in the solution of our problems. Instead of looking for saviors, we should be calling for leadership that will challenge us to face problems for which there are no simple, painless solutions -- problems that require us to learn new ways. We have many such problems: uncompetitive industry, terrorism, drug abuse, poverty, poor public education, environmental hazards, and obstacles to constructive foreign and domestic relations.<br />People in authority cannot quickly resolve such problems as terrorism. They can rather give us a feeling of satisfaction by skillfully applying ready technical means: bombing known terrorists' camps in Afghanistan or applying \\"sleeping gas\\" and elite soldiers onto the guerillas in the \\"Nord Ost\\" theater in Moscow. But this is only cutting the symptoms, this is not enough to solve the problem with the deep roots. The whole world should be mobilized to work on these issues, and when every child on the world can be born into an atmosphere of happiness and freedom, in a society that encourages intellectual growth and humility rather than fanatism and suicide-bombing as a goal of life -- then and only then we can consider terrorism to be eliminated.<br />Mr. Heifets provides tangible guidance for a leader to solve complex issues without the risk of being scapegoated or assassinated. This book is a good manual without easy answers.	2002-11-02
US	47571284	RCHTBY6LM8FBK	0201699699	615308119	Agile Software Development	Books	5	12	13	N	N	Individuals and interactions over processes and tools	This book is often compared with \\"The Mythincal Man-Month\\" by Brooks or \\"Peopleware\\" by DeMarko and Lister. While Brooks mostly emphasize that the term \\"man-month\\" can't be applied to software development, DeMarko and Lister focus to productive environment and jelled teams, Alistair Cockburn with the book \\"Agile Software Development\\" covers much wider area, including the choice of the right methodology, problems of individuals and aspects of communication. <br />The author has found the common denominator among all \\"agile\\" methodologies like Extreme Programming, SCRUM, Crystal Clear, Responsibility-Driven Design and Adaptive Software Development.<br />That common denominator is individuals and interactions over processes and tools; working software over comprehensive documentation; customer collaboration over contract negotiation; responding to change over following a plan. The book describes how to accomplish that, not only describing the problems and encouraging to put some attention into that, but gives some advices that can be found valuable.<br />The author recommends that each project should have its own methodology, that fit its best. The author have methodologies to recommend for large and very large projects as well.<br />I recommend &quot;Extreme Programming&quot; by Kent Beck and &quot;Adaptive Software Development&quot; by James A. Highsmith in addition to this book.	2002-10-24
US	47571284	R3DFXHOTT7S2JV	0201733862	497169336	Software Craftsmanship: The New Imperative	Books	5	14	17	N	N	Reusable code is a myth	The book is very easy to read, fits any IT-aware reader however, it spots very interesting topics for any experienced software developer. First, it emphasizes that programming is not the job for the youngsters only: a truly great developer is worth at leas as much as any manager (including the CEO). Why the people who worked as programmers for 15 years and reached the craftsmanship-experience should find that their salary has reached the maximum level established by the company, and move to another, more paid career, for example, to manage of a horde of dumb inexperienced developers? Why don't developers focus their attention on becoming really good at using the existing tools? A craftsman programmer is really deserving to be paid much. Stop overpaying underqualifying newbies just because they have Java and other ten programming languages in their resume. A person may only be skilled in one, maximum two languages she is constantly practicing.<br />Another fresh idea is that \\"Software Engineering\\" metaphor is no longer valid. Software development is not an engineering activity, it is a craftsmanship. A team should consist of craftsmen, journeymen and apprentices. In a blacksmith, for example, a 60-year old craftsman might still show highest skills and awesome productivity. A master craftsman may learn a new technology from an apprentice, but it doesn't mean that she is no longer a master. Apprenticeship is much more effective than schooling.<br />The author also shows that the \\"reusable code\\" is a myth. Truly reusable components are possible, but these are not internally developed components. Reusable components need an entire organization dedicated to their creation and support. The issue here is use, not reuse.<br />I would recommend \\"Agile Software Development\\" by Alistair Cockburn in addition to this book.	2002-10-24

Since that we had a lot of unanswered questions: <BR>- how to spread the pair programming practice across our organization, <BR>- how to argue with the people who did never try pair programming but was against it, <BR>- how to overcome management resistance to pair programming, <BR>- how to gain support and acceptance from our peers, <BR>- how to organize workplace layout in details, how to rotate pairs ... <BR>This book has answered all the questions. <br />The authors did the awesome homework analyzing lots of books related to project management, software development and human relations. You will find lots of references. However, the book contains only a few authors' own assertion. The authors prefer to base on someone else's books and publications, logically combining and deducing them. <br />The most valuable aspect of the book is that the authors have interviewed lots of Pair Programming experts, who gave the answers to most specific questions.	2002-10-13

This book is a good starting point for anyone who needs to create a compiler, parser or scanner, but didn't read anything about compiler design theory yet. This book is completely self-contained and assumes only the familiarity with programming languages and the mathematical sophistication commonly found in juniors or seniors. <br />The material in this book has been taught for several years in one-semester first-year graduate courses at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, N.Y., the State University of New York at Albany, and many other institutions. The bewildered looks of students in these institutions have motivated the authors to do several rewrites of the materials. That's why the book is pleasant to read and easy to understand.<br />The book contains a good introduction to state machines and all modern grammars, including, but not limited to, LALR(1).<br />Since the book doesn't cover code generation, but only lexical and syntax part, it is still actual since published 1976. For example, the most popular nowadays LALR(1) grammar, supported by Yacc and Bison, is a core of the GNU compiler and many other commercial compilers. But the book itself is tool-free, it explains the background that never expires, rather than bothering the reader with the tools which may exist today and vanish tomorrow. The example of such book with a mess of theory and tools is \\"Compilers: Principles, Techniques, and Tools\\" by by Alfred V. Aho.<br />The book \\"Compiler Design Theory\\" is embracing, neat and actual.	2002-10-13

To determine all major political players, involved in the project is the task of any participant: from the stakeholder and project manager to the minor developer. It's a hard task to spot all the players, but once you did it, your project will get more chances to survive and you will keep your sanity. This book doesn't have easy answers, but it will encourage you to start analyzing things which you never thought about, it will encourage adaptive work on yourself.<br />Because this book is encouraging, but not practical, I would recommend \\"Software Project Survival Guide\\" by Steve McConnell and \\"Agile Software Development\\" by Alistair Cockburn prior to reading this book.	2002-10-13
US	47571284	RKNYWCIWSJ6CH	0201708426	49669404	Extreme Programming Installed	Books	4	7	8	N	Y	Accurate, Practical	This book, as well as \\"Extreme Programming Applied\\" by Ken Auer and Roy Miller are the two which should be read by a developer after the introductory \\"Extreme Programming Explained\\" by Kent Beck. XP Explained will encourage a reader to the new way of thinking, without bothering with technical details. For a manager it is OK, but for the developer, a bunch of questions will arise. \\"XP Applied\\" and \\"XP Installed\\" are to answer these questions, providing lots of tips, tricks and case studies.<br />The only disadvantage is that all the useful examples in these book contain code in SmallTalk, while C++ and Java are popular nowadays. SmallTalk has a distinct, unique style and may frighten C++ or Java developers. That's why I've rated the book four stars.<br />I would recommend this book to any XP'er.	2002-10-12
US	47571284	R3ECAATHV6URCA	0932633439	268406698	Peopleware: Productive Projects and Teams   (Second Edition)	Books	4	29	32	N	Y	Deep, accurate, pleasant to read	The main goal of this book is that it encourages the software developers and their management to think deeply about they way they create the software. Software development is the \\"research\\", not the \\"production\\", and the stimulus and processes that work well in for example metallurgy will harm software development. The authors show the consequences of borrowing organizational processes from other areas to software. They encourage to focus on the people rather than to process. The software developers aren't &quot;replaceable units&quot;, &quot;plastic uniformed people&quot;.<br />Although the textual work of the authors is marvelous, the quality of the printed book (paperback edition) is awful. The paper is thin and translucent, showing the lines from the other pages, the interline spacing is too low, turning a page to a big mess. That was the only reason I've rated the book as four-stars.<br />The information in this book is very accurate, without pure assertions. The authors always are giving full references if they are providing figures or studies. The authors have a good sense of humor, and it is the great pleasure to read this book. The information is given in the very dense manner: the other authors might have needed ten volumes to express what Tom DeMarco and Timothy Lister has put in this small book. <br />I strongly recommend this book to any individual involved in software development, as well as \\"Agile Software Development\\" by Alistair Cockburn. These books aren't from \\"ten steps to success\\" series. They encourage deep, creative approach to the topic.	2002-10-12

The authors also describe how to gain benefit from involving the user and other parties to the OO design process. <br />I was in OO development for five years and I was thinking about a solution which will improve the efficiency of OO design and help to avoid splitting the program between developers who create their own set of classes they are responsible for. Such splitting leads to integration problems and overall design imbalance. Fred Brooks has described this consequences in his famous book \\"The Mythical Man-Month\\", where the modules are being written first and integrated later, and the coordination of interfaces between modules written by each developer requires essential effort and time. The CRC Card Book shows how to have \\"the interfaces\\" coordinated in the very beginning. <br />However, the methodology described in this book is \\"fragile\\". As soon as it isn't followed by all of the developers, it became useless. But if it is followed, the results are amazing. The book, however, is not very easy to read and lack something which can attract the developers who are \\"neutral\\" to improving their way of creating OO programs. But, for the people who already have strong OO background and are seeking the way how to improve their efficiency significant, the book is a must-have.	2002-10-12

It also must be said that Pegasus development is slow enough, thus this book will be actual for most recent version of Pegasus (except a promised version 4.x which did not came out yet [14-Oct-200]). The authors of the book worked in close cooperation with the author of the software, and his view on the things, as well as a very interesting history of program development can be found in this book also. You will be an expert in Pegasus Mail after reading this book.	2000-10-14
