US	52584172	RVESA4DSQ5V0L	1573223123	348793573	Our Inner Ape	Books	4	54	63	N	N	Entertaining and thoughtful, but with the ocassional lapse	Proving that all social science remains cyclical, Frans De Waal offers readers a new trip around in the never ending debate of the biological roots of human culture and behavior.  For decades, as any student who sat in on an intro anthropology class will tell you, the reigning comparison stood between Homo sapiens and chimpanzees.  Thus these aggressive, territorial, and -- to anthropomorphize a bit -- brutal primates, with their hierarchical and male dominated social structure stood as the explanation for all of humankind's worst impulses.  Such analysis fit well into the several millennium old dichotomy between our \\"animal\\" (evil) and \\"human\\" (good) impulses.   <br /> <br />Through his fascinating and often amusing analysis of the bonobo, another primate with whom, like chimps, humans share 98.5% of genetics'.  Where the chimp is brutal the bonobo is peaceful.  Where chimps are territorial and hierarchical, the bonobos share and maintain a female dominate structure.  Where chimps jealously guard sexual privileges, bonobos mate, well like animals, sharing partners in all conceivable combinations (De Waal pays this great attention, suggesting that such \\"loose\\" sexual relationships prevent aggression).   <br /> <br />De Waal writes well, and offers an interesting thesis that in fact both sides of human nature may well come from our animal roots.  He even presents interesting evidence for empathy among bonobs and more startling still, the elusive notion of consciousness, that an individual can project themselves into an alien form, such as bonobos caring for birds.  All of this makes for a fun and thought provoking read. <br /> <br />De Waal falls short, however, in not going deep enough.  While he demonstrates evidence for the emotional hardiness of chimps vs. the far more delicate bonobo (during a bombing in WWII all a zoo's bonobos suffered heart attacks, while the chimps survived), but does not go far enough in examining the potential genetic basis of such behavior.  Also, while he does offer in bonobos interesting evidence of alternative survival strategies to aggression, he unfortunately empathizes a bit too much with these gentle creatures.  The resulting anthropomorphize, while forgivable, distracts the readers and leads De Waal to make some arguments that seem a bit forced and ignore viable alternatives. <br /> <br />Such criticism, however, should not cause any to shy away from this quite enjoyable and thought provoking work. <br />	2005-10-10

Sadly, this fine genre recently seems to have fallen on hard times, now consisting of taking a bible story, adding in a dose of sex and modern sensibility and mixing.  Such novels, and they are legion, dilute the power of the original story, offering readers an easily digested mockery. <br /> <br />David Maine, beginning here with his novel \\"The Preservationist\\" and continuing with his critically acclaimed tale of Cain, \\"The Fallen\\" brings the genre back in the direction of its powerful past.  Showing both great respect, thought, and considerable humor, Maine delves into the story of Noah, fleshing out the characters with a sensitive eye towards both the narrative and the reader.  Most importantly, while making the characters multidimensional and sympathetic, the novel never tries to white wash to ethical complexity of the Creator destroying most of his creation. <br /> <br />Readers familiar with the biblical account of the flood will recognize that the story includes a heavy dose of family drama.  Maine builds on this deftly, creating tension and an engaging thread that binds the story together.  Further credit must be given for the author's excellent use of the midrashic stories that surround the biblical text, often to create great humor.   <br /> <br />A word must also be said about Maine's excellent use of the character of the Divine.  Most biblical fiction either ignores The Creator's central role, a strange betrayal of the original text, or turn the characters into puppets pulled on strings.  Far from either of these pitfalls, The Preservationist demonstrates a clever balancing act, turning the story into an interesting and yet strangely familiar tale of the challenges of faith. <br />	2005-09-29

However, the text he produces, far from being scholarly, often reads a bit like a tabloid account of King David.  Deconstructing the book of Samuel, a Herculean and important task, has been accomplished elsewhere by serious scholars who offer very deep reconstructions of this most fascinating and contradictory character.  Readers looking to explore the subject would do well to look for Professor B. Halpern's seminal work, \\"David's Secret Demons.\\"  While not as breezy in style, the book goes far deeper in uncovering its subject and will offer the reader far more food for thought.  Therefore, if looking for an easy read, pick up McKenzie, but those with a serious interest in King David should put the time and effort into a more serious work.  Please, take a look at Halpern; you won't regret it.	2005-09-29

Jones' subject, free blacks in the antebellum south who themselves owned slaves, is discussed at length in many reviews.  All that needs to be said is that such material would surely weigh down the work of a lesser writer.  Fortunate for his reader's Jones proves more than up to the task.   <br /> <br />Bringing to life a vast cast of characters, the author paints a world rich in physical and emotional detail.  Some may find difficulty keeping track of all the personalities present in the novel, but no one should take an author to task for requiring an attentive reader.  Those making the effort will find it well worth their effort as Jones take the opportunity to explore the many facets of chattel slavery, from its effects on law and commerce to how it came to poison even the very bonds of family. <br /> <br />A word must also be said about Jones' unique narrative style.  Unwilling to be confined to the period of which he writes, Jones moves the author to and fro across vast stretches of time, sometimes even generations, sometimes even within a larger paragraph.  No doubt many may find this method of story telling at times jarring.  However, given a chance, readers will discover the unique rhythm this author brings to his work and appreciate the broad canvas on which he paints.   <br /> <br />Despite the challenges, readers who love fiction should rush to embrace this haunting book of family, love, and human bondage. <br />	2005-09-27

How a group of religious knights sworn to a holy quest found themselves warring with other Christians instead of Muslims proves an irresistible tale.   <br /> <br />Several key strengths of the book stand out.  Characters, almost all well fleshed out and distinct, populate the landscape.  Philips also serves the readers well in explaining the motivations, often alien to a modern, of the knights who took up the cross.  In an age when authors often try to project current motivations and opinions back through time, this effort proves refreshing indeed.  Simply bashing the crusaders as ignorant or barbaric serves no purpose and Philips to his credit never does.  That said, several parallels exist between failed modern efforts and the Fourth Crusade, proving an interesting lens. <br /> <br />A few short comings remain.  Byzantium was nothing if not Byzantine, and likely no author could explain its complexity without doubling the length of this work.  Still, I often felt lost or worse, that important details were being glossed over.  Despite this, the book remains excellent, either as a launching point for further examination or an informative stand alone read.   <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-09-21
US	52584172	R3BPDWPUIW8618	0465046754	692787574	The Republican War on Science	Books	5	89	105	N	N	Important and Timely	No doubt many reviewers will attack Mr. Mooney's exceptional and timely work claiming a combination of \\"this is nothing new,\\" and \\"every one does it.\\"  Such attacks simply demonstrate the strength of Mr. Mooney's thesis -- that at the beginning of the 21st century, at least in America, even science is being turned into a partisan spectator sport.  The trend, if it continues, harbingers dangerous days ahead and is well worth careful examination.  This work presents an excellent place to start. <br /> <br />Mr. Mooney cleverly traces the current situation back to the attacks on \\"liberal intellectuals\\" in the middle of the last century.  These statements, often a mantra from the Nixon years forward in the GOP, originally began as an attack on the social sciences.  Thus, any effort to design government plans to aid the poor were labeled as \\"liberal.\\"  In fairness, this description as least holds some truth as the modern liberal-conservative dichotomy often comes down to government can help solve problems - government is the problem. <br /> <br />Recently, however, particularly in the last 20 years, the same attack has frighteningly been pushed into the \\"hard\\" sciences.  As such, one can often hear GOP faithful from Senators to Limbaugh lambasting anyone who accepts the evidence for human activity induced climate change as a \\"liberal,\\" with no concern for their political views.  The trend springs in no small part from the close alliance between the GOP and big businesses that see science on subjects ranging from water pollution to climate change as threats to their current business model.   <br /> <br />Mooney successfully explains how the media's hunger for controversy and short attention span plays handily into the hands of those who attack science.  Thus, even if 99% of scientists accept a theory, the 1% can combat them if provided with substantial financial support and a powerful PR Campaign.  Christian \\"conservatives\\" jumped on this bandwagon with so-called \\"intelligent design.\\"  The fact that the method for ID relies not on the scientific method, but on arguments of analogy and negative arguments (both major science no-nos) is of no weight in a media that craves screaming and refuses to pass any thoughtful judgments. <br /> <br />The United States built a mighty economy on the basis of strong scientific engineering and science throughout the last century.  Now, with science falling into disrepute to serve short term political aims, every American should fear the decline that is sure to follow.  Mr. Mooney's book provides a much needed wake up call to the danger ahead.   <br />	2005-09-15

Sadly, much of it will surely come from talking heads who never read it and have little interest in the topic beyond their particular political axe to grind.  That is their loss.   <br /> <br />Mann cogently argues that pre-Columbian civilization in the Western hemisphere far exceeded the stereotypes of savages that dominated much of the original thinking in Europe that greatly colors our modern perceptions.  Far from simple, across the two American continents a great diversity of cultures thrived, marked by great advances in agriculture, art, architecture, and social organization.  Indeed, from the great cities of Mesoamerica (often larger than their European counterparts) to the complex social organization of the Northern American natives of the Ohio valley with developed notions of liberty and autonomy, one cannot help but be impressed.   <br /> <br />In a few places the work falls a bit short, particularly where Mann seems to become over enthusiastic regarding his topic.  While unfortunate, the author is not an anthropologist and should be forgiven for such flights of fancy.   Anthropology remains conflicted over the period of initial human settlement in the West and to those first settlers relationship with the pre-Columbian natives found by Europeans on their arrival.  However, Mann's decision to gloss over the controversy little damages the pace of the book or the strength of his argument.  <br /> <br />Readers of Guns, Germs, and Steel will surely take particular interest in this work.  In several places this work dovetails with Diamond's argument, while in others it stands in sharp contrast.  One particular point to chew on is the relative material wealth of natives of North America, with rich available food stuffs contrasting with the more central and \\"advanced\\" cultures of Mesoamerica.  This issue points to one of the greatarguments of Diamond's critics, that it was the relative material poverty as opposed to wealth in Europe and China that spurred technological advance to offset such challenges. <br /> <br />Readers will surely take great interest in this work and find it a launching pad for further examination of a fascinating topic. <br />	2005-09-12
US	52584172	R2KG489KBHA4P	0465083269	695969114	Radicals in Robes: Why Extreme Right-Wing Courts Are Wrong for America	Books	5	20	30	N	N	Crisp powerful analysis	Cass Sunstein, a University of Chicago Law professor, political scientist, and former Supreme Court clerk here brings his powerful intellect to bare on the task of critically deconstructing the so-called \\"Fundamentalist\\" also known as Origin Intent method of examining the constitution.  In other, less capable hands this effort might well have devolved into an anti-conservative rant, but to professor Sunstein's credit he instead delivers an even handed, thought provoking, and often provocative look at this growing legal movement.  More impressive still, he delivers all this in a short, readable, highly entertaing text. <br /> <br />Sunstein does not simply reject conservative constitutional analysis or even the original intent school.  He acknowledges that it can often be compelling and further concedes it to be a reasonable approach.  However, he goes on from there to point out its two major flaws.  The first and most galling, is that original intent advocates follow the principle of examining history of determining the thoughts of drafters, except when it will conflict with other political ideology.  Thus, while Justices Scalia and Thomas tout their devotion to this method, they also reject affirmative action.  Unfortunately, given that the same congress that drafted the 14th Amendment after the Civil War also saw Affirmative Action as a just and reasonable effort to compensate for past injustices against African Americans -- these efforts executed through the Freedman's Bureau -- their efforts fail there own judicial test.  Given that the hallmark of any reasonable judicial philosophy requires consistency, even when they lead a judge to a decision that conflicts with his personal politics, one can only question justice's Scalia and Thomas's judicial temperament.   <br /> <br />The second problem Sunstein sees, which proves far more profound, is that advocates of this ideology by limiting the powers of congress and often exempting the States from the Bill of Rightsintend to transform the very nature of the citizenry relationship with their government.  Sunstein never claims that this renders the philosophy illegitimate, quite the opposite, but does cogently argue that few Americans, even those who advocate this position, understand the ramifications of its end result.   <br /> <br />By sharply limiting the powers of congress in areas of interstate commerce and the ability to delegate authority, Sunstein points out that these radical Fundamentalists would eliminate such institutions as the Environmental Protection Agency, the Security and Exchange Commission, and other institutions that protect American's in many crucial spheres.  Would most American's really want to eliminate the Federal Government's power to protect the environment, worker's safety, and investors?  Sunstein rightly points out that most polls indicate exactly the opposite.   <br /> <br />Sunstein further strengthens his point by indicating some of the most radical views taken by members of the court embracing this ideology.  The most shocking, Justice Thomas's stance that neither the First Amendment nor the rest of the constitution blocks a state from establishing a State religion remains for me the most shocking.  Again, to his credit Professor Sunstein does not reject this position as unreasonable, but instead points out that such radical transformation represents a break with the usual understanding of conservativism, with its respect for precedent, and would likewise shock many Americans. <br /> <br />None of this is meant to imply Professor Sunstein is not an advocate for his position.  To the contrary he argues against what he sees as a dangerous ideological movement with passion and thoughtfulness.  All the more reason in this time of judicial transformation responsible Americans should read this short book so as to understand the stakes.    <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-09-07

Dennis Ross, arguably the most significant American diplomat active in the Arab-Israeli conflict over the last 20 years delivers a memoir replete with insider details, thoughtful insights, and illuminating characterizations.  All this makes the Ross's text indispensable to a full understanding of the negotiations between Israel and the Arab States from 1988-2000.  That said, to encompass such a vast stretch of time with any detail the work must be understandably both long and dense, with the hardcover coming in at 800 pages in very small type.   <br /> <br />Despite the time commitment digesting such a work requires, interested readers will not be disappointed.  Ross knows all of the players and has a very more nuanced understanding of them then any other writer.  Moreover, his first person observations as a participant on the ground, dealing with all the players, means that no comparable text to the Missing Peace will likely ever appear.  Moreover, given the often covert nature of these negotiations, few individuals if any can lay claim to any first hand knowledge of almost all of them. <br /> <br />A word must be said on those who attack Mr. Ross as being biased for Israel.  Such charges seem spurious since those who write them often critique The Clinton Administration as being too Pro-Israel while citing Bush I as being balanced.  That Mr. Ross served as the architect of the proposals and strategies for both administrations only serves to show his gift as a negotiator and as an honest broker.  Indeed, Israelis (Shamir, Netanyahu, Brarak) as often as Arabs (Asad, Erkat, Arafat) come under harsh criticism.  What becomes clear throughout is that, like most negotiators, what most angers Mr. Ross are actors who fail to engage in honest negotiations.  That more than any other reason remains why Mr. Arafat comes under the harshest critique throughout the text.  Concerned readers, however, would do well to note that almost every other memoir by someone with first hand experience with Mr. Arafat comes to a similar conclusion. <br /> <br />Lastly, readers will need to make their own decision regarding Mr. Ross's claim as to what was and was not offered at the final negotiations between Barak, Arafat, and Clinton.  Despite claims to the contrary, I find no reasonable basis to assume that Mr. Ross, along with President Clinton, Sec State Albright, and others are lying.  Moreover, the claim would make little sense, since if indeed the so-called 95% solution was acceptable but never offered, one must ask why Arafat did not run to embrace it when it leaked afterwards, thus calling a supposed Israeli bluff. <br /> <br />All that said, whatever your position, you will find no other text as complete on the subject.  Wherever you may stand, Ross's book will remain indispensable. <br />	2005-09-06

The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time tells the tale that beginning with the dog in a middle class English neighborhood through the eyes and in the voice of a high functioning autistic boy who wants to know what happened.  Such a story might fail on many points, becoming saccharine, the author lapsing in the voice of the narrator, or even taking the story in some unreal direction.  Haddon avoids all these pitfalls delivering instead a poignant and entertaining tale. <br /> <br />Most interesting of all, Haddon does a wonderful job at brining the narrator alive and making the reader understand his unique condition.  On matters of human emotion, the reader recognizes things long before the autistic narrator.  At the same time, avoiding conventions that would portray the protagonist as weak, simple, or stupid, Haddon creates someone we respect for his problem solving ability.  Indeed, the narrator often solves mysteries long before the reader, but in ways that remain both believable and credible.  Haddon further deftly gives us a window into his thought process and makes us feel just how alien our world can be to someone who does not understand emotional nuance.   <br /> <br />With its careful prose and rich story, readers will surely appreciate Mr. Haddon's considerable gifts.  Highly recommended. <br />	2005-09-02

Thus fans of the genre should be overjoyed at The Illuminator, a wonderful first novel with strong characters, a well paced plot, a murder mystery, a love story, and historic details sure to delight.   <br /> <br />Vantrease focuses on a topic little seen in historical fiction, namely the rise of Wycoff and the Lolards of England who served as many of the intellectual antecedents to the Protestant Reformation.  Readers will take great interest in the many historic characters she weaves into the tale and her deft incorporation of detail without ever falling into droning exposition.  She further captures much of the flavor of daily life that can bring this genre off the page and into the readers heart, with details of dress, commerce, class, and most importantly cuisine. <br /> <br />Following a fine tradition in historical fiction, Ms. Vantrease does not place actual historical characters at center stage, but instead lets them stand in the foreground, appearing occasionally, and focuses her prose on characters of her own creation.  This further allows her to explore this fascinating period.  Indeed, I found myself learning a great deal about the struggle to produce a Bible in the vernacular as well as the history of the Catholic Church in Britain.  That I could learn while at the same time enjoying a good murder mystery, a love story, and a complex family drama speaks volumes for the authors skill. <br /> <br />While the work does suffer from some of the pitfalls of a first novel, Ms. Vantrease's work remains well worth reading and may bode well for some wonderful things to come.  I look forward to her future works with great anticipation. <br />	2005-09-01

Unfortunately, as with so many of their activities, they twist the truth, present facts selectively, and seek only to persuade rather than to inform.  Examining the positions of ISM's various leaders reveals a group that is, in fact, more radical than the majority of Palestinian factions.  ISM leaders refuse to condemn any sort of terror activity, including suicide bombings, yet attack every Israeli effort at self protection.  ISM proudly boasts of its efforts serving as human shields for wanted terrorists, hoping that the presence of someone with a passport will serve as protection.  Further, ISM impedes even those activities, such as finding and destroying tunnels used to smuggle explosives used in terror attacks that most Arab states do not condemn. <br /> <br />Cautious readers must ask themselves a few crucial questions that ISM members would rather they not.  In what other country of the Middle East would they be allowed to function?  Why do these individuals choose Israel, the Middle East's only democracy, as their target, rather than such areas as Saudi Arabia with its oppression of women or Sudan currently undertaking wholesale genocide?  Lastly, who funds the ISM's considerable and quite professional media operation?  You will find the answers to none of these questions in this book.   <br /> <br />Groups like ISM, little more than debutant activists, do nothing to aid the cause of peace but serve only their own romantic thrill seeking ends.  Having spent considerable time in the Middle East, including the West Bank and Gaza, I can tell you that those seriously interested in the problems facing the Palestinian people will learn next to nothing from this work.   <br />	2005-08-30
US	52584172	R3AP9QMTTIV1CO	1560256230	997449003	The Truth About Camp David: The Untold Story About the Collapse of the Middle East Peace Process (Nation Books)	Books	2	49	114	N	N	Some intereting facts, but often twisted to suit author's aims	Like most great diplomatic moments, successes and failures alike, decades will pass before anything approaching a full history of the Camp David debacle can appear.  Even then, disagreements on the apportionment of blame will likely continue on for decades after.  Given the wide interest in the Israeli-Arab conflict and the complex nature of the negotiations, new works exploring the crucial climax at Camp David remain welcome.  Some dismiss Mr. Swisher's work because he was not in fact part of the negotiating team, but instead was responsible at Camp David only for negotiations.  That seems to me unfair.  Clayton Swisher clearly did considerable \\"leg work\\" to prepare this text; sadly both his rather obvious bias and almost juvenile desire to settle scores renders what could have been an important work at best suspect. <br /> <br />Mr. Swisher's book follows on the heels of Dennis Ross's interesting \\"The Missing Peace\\" and, given Mr. Ross's direct involvement in the negotiations; no one could be blamed for looking at other works as well.  However, Mr. Swisher spends much of his time looking to lay the blame at Mr. Ross's feet, even when he makes claims that others at Camp David, many more central then Mr. Swisher directly contradict his statements.  Much for example is made in this work of Mr. Ross's change of \\"municipal Jerusalem\\" to \\"greater Jerusalem\\" in a draft as if this caused the breakdown of the agreement.  Unfortunately, Ross's change in fact was a return to an earlier draft after being changed by Robert Malley, a member of the US team and now often a talking head representing the Palestinian point of view, who made the alteration without consulting any of the parties.  Malley has never denied this.  Moreover, days would pass before the negotiations actually broke down. <br /> <br />Swisher's target, perhaps seeking to sell books by putting forward a contradictory point of view, shifts the blame wherever he can to Israel and the US negotiating team.  While such an effort might well be reasonable, Mr. Swisher often twists facts, making excuses for Palestinian gaffs while blowing minor facts out of all proportion.  For example, Mr. Swisher brushes aside the days lost when Mr. Arafat and the Palestinian team insisted that Jews had no historic link to Jerusalem or the Temple Mound -- a position farcical on its face -- as mere posturing.  However, he never mentions that such ideas, undermining the Jewish people very claim to the Land, serve only to inflame the parties and make agreement almost impossible.  Nor does Swisher ever consider the Palestinians failure to negotiate in good faith, treating every Israeli offer simply as a new base line, rather than offering any proposals of their own.  Again, even Robert Malley concedes that this disingenuous strategy by the Palestinians likely doomed Camp David from the start. <br /> <br />Swisher's dismissal of all Israeli concerns reaches a crescendo when he simply casts aside as silly Israel's interest and the Palestinian's refusal of any compromise for the so-called \\"right of return,\\" or the claim that all Palestinian who left the area of modern Israel and all their descendants must have a right immigrate to Israel, a right held by no other people.  As to the simple fact that this would lead to the destruction of the Jewish State and that the Palestinians are thus expecting Israel to commit national suicide, on this problem Mr. Swisher remains silent. <br /> <br />Lastly, one cannot help but marvel at Mr. Swisher's odd coverage of the events after Camp David.  That Yasser Arafat led a bloody war against Israel rather than offering an alternative proposal for peace is dismissed.  Mr. Swisher combs through events searching for, magnifying, and twisting any event that will make Israel look bad, while at the same time minimizing or even ignoring the waves of suicide terrorists who have murdered hundreds of Israeli civilians in cold blood.  Mr. Swisher even parrots points of Palestinian propaganda so thoroughly disproved that even Palestinian leaders no longer mention them, such as the claim of massacres during Israeli operations in Jenin, which exhaustive study long ago proved to be nothing more than a fabrication.   <br /> <br />Curiosity will cause readers to ask why Mr. Swisher takes this extremely biased view.  Fortunately, he lays out his rather simplistic point of view at the very beginning of the book by writing the following, \\"The primary reason for Arab and Muslim anger against America has been and remains unbridled support for Israel's oppression of the Palestinians.\\"  Again, one can only muse as to why Mr. Swisher does not take Osama bin Laden at his word when he spoke shortly after 9/11 that his hatred manifests from the presence of American Christian soldiers in the heart of Islamic holy lands like Saudi Arabia and later Iraq.  Surely neither the bombings in Madrid or more recently in London had anything to do with Israel, but it seems for Mr. Swisher's simplistic world view, it is at the door step of the Jewish state where all blame is to be laid.   <br />	2005-08-30

Given Eisner's interest in issues of racism and anti-Semitism, particularly in his later years, The Plot: The Secret Story of the Protocols of the Elders of Zion stands as a fitting capstone to this tremendous career. <br /> <br />Eisner takes the reader entreatingly through the history of the development and continuing dissemination of this most famous forgery, stopping along the way to offer incontrovertible proof of it being a forgery.  The best piece of evidence of course still stands on the work being plagiarized almost word for word from the French Author Maurice Joly's earlier work attacking the Emperor Napoleon, \\"The Dialogue in Hell Between Machiavelli and Montesquieu.\\"  Yet, Eisner goes further examining how the work continues to be published and spread, particularly in the modern Middle East. <br /> <br />Of particular value, this work also demonstrates how the graphic form can be used for education through entertainment.  Yes, there exist more through and scholarly works on this important subject, yet none are more accessible.  For that reason alone, anyone interested in the subject should purchase a copy. <br />	2005-08-15

However, in this concise and often interesting biography, the erudite Christopher Hitchens goes too far in attempting to portray Jefferson as \\"the author\\" of the American nation.  Yet, in embodying many of the young nations deepest contradictions, Jefferson could in many ways be seen as the American ideal in microcosm.  While this as well as Jefferson's almost schizophrenic complexity makes him an almost irresistible subject for any biographer. <br /> <br />Hitchens choice of subject, while interesting, could hardly be described as surprising.  Often acerbic, but always clever, the contrary Hitchens takes great pride in infuriating his progressive cohorts be taking the opposite position of his political fellows, his early and continued support of the Iraq War being a prime example.  So, in choosing Jefferson, now often reviled for his the hypocrisy of at once proclaiming universal human rights while at the same time holding men and women in bondage.  To these attacks Hitchens does not excuse Jefferson but rightly points out they are obvious, boring, and wearisome as a cudgel with which to attack the third President. <br /> <br />Seemingly Hitchens has three agendas in this short work.  First, to defend Jefferson against those on the left who attack him by reminding them of his commitment to the very core idea of liberalism, that people can through education and effort better themselves and deserve the opportunity for such betterment.  Second, to liberate Jefferson from the bizarre argument now emanating from the religious right that he and his fellow founders of the United States intended to create a \\"Christian country,\\" a suggestion laughable on its face to any with any knowledge of the period.  Third, and less obvious, Hitchens seems to wish to use Jefferson to attack the recently ascendant Hamilton whom Hitchens sees asthe patron saint of the current American political alignment which he detests. <br /> <br />To the first effort Hitchens does well.  Regarding the second he shines, particularly with his use of some of Jefferson's more memorable quotes.  The third point, however, fails.  Interestingly, in many ways Jefferson seems the archetype for the current attitude of the current administration. With his ability to justify anything, from lying to George Washington as he coordinated an attack on the President's administration within the cabinet, to his praise of the French Revolution even as it descended into savagery, to the willingness of the original advocate of limited Federal power to assert robust authority when it suited him in the White House, Jefferson in ways proves the perfect amoral actor, able to justify anything that suits his current needs. <br /> <br />While Hitchens occasionally strays to the over zealous in his support of Jefferson, that does not detract from the books excellent qualities and entertaining style.  Indeed, with Jefferson, straying too far to one extreme or another seems a pitfall in which all of his biographers eventually fall.   <br />	2005-08-04
US	52584172	R2OAWSA57BO24C	1594200459	697870179	The End of Poverty: Economic Possibilities for Our Time	Books	5	6	6	N	N	A thought provoking must read	That Jeffrey Sachs spends so much of this book speaking about, well, the genius of Professor Jeffrey Sachs would be unreadable from any other author, but in the case it is simply occasionally insufferable.  The reason?  Professor Sachs may be occasionally boastful, but given that he remains perhaps the greatest living expert of the economics of development and aid, he has some right to be boastful.  Indeed, what he here lays out may be one of the most thought provoking books on this critical subject ever written for laymen. <br /> <br />The genius of Sachs's book comes in his use of China as a case study to contrast against the Africa experience.  Through this he successfully disassembles the arguments of those who claim: first, that aid does not work; second, that government cannot effectively foster development; and third, that efficient capital markets are the panacea so many often claim.  Indeed, the China case remains revealing.  To the first argument, he points out that China's successes began with the introduction of disease resistant high yield crops in the middle of this century.  These crops allowed for the creation of a food surplus, which, as professor Sachs convincingly argues, is the basis of economic growth in agrarian economies.   <br /> <br />Smashing the second argument requires only pointing to effect of Mao's creation of health, educational, and transportation infrastructure.  This also lays waste to third argument, as this success is done with government controlled markets that in turn lay the ground work for the open market that now fosters China's success. <br /> <br />Moreover, Sachs clearly understands the value of guilt.  Those who claim Africa cannot be helped, are undeserving, or must simply help themselves, seem to know little about the continent or its problems.  For almost every argument against Africa, Sachs points to a case somewhere else in the world where the people are of a different hue where the rejected policy was embraced. Tothose who think forgiving Africa's debt would somehow foster \\"irresponsibility?\\" Yet that is exactly what the west did for Germany in the wake of WWII.  That aid is useless if the state is not democratic?  Yet look at all the aid that poured from Japan into China and South Korea, laying the ground work for their success. <br /> <br />Of particular interest to me, other than the issue of food surplus, is Sach's powerful evidence about the destructive power of malaria and its devastation of African economies and the hypocrisy of those who argue that markets are the answer, yet will not reduce agricultural subsidies to allow Africa's goods to be competitive in Western markets.  To the same group, he points to all the West did to aid Eastern Europe at the end of the cold war, while doing next to nothing to Africa, which became a disaster partially due to the various proxy wars the US and USSR fought in this period.   <br /> <br />Lastly one fact stands out as to why this book deserves attention.  While the horror of the recent tsunami in South East Asia grabbed headlines and brought billions in aid to some reasonably affluent countries (Thailand and Indonesia) a like number of people die in Africa EVERY WEEK yet the world does not even care enough to look.  Sachs lays out a program to help Africa onto its feet.  Far from simply throwing money at the problem as some critics have accused him of advocating, he suggests specific policies, with specific costs, and testable measures of success and failure.  Every moment we look away millions die, so isn't it time we aid our fellow human beings on this forgotten continent?  <br />	2005-08-03

In the wake of the superb Hyperion Cantos, the thoughtful and talented Dan Simmons now, by producing his Illium /Olympos series, confronts that old problem.  While readers may find that these books fail to measure up to the Cantos, any author would be proud to produce these excellent novels. <br /> <br />Rare among science fiction authors, Dan Simmons holds a keen interest in literature and philosophy over technology and hackneyed plot twists.  Cantos readers will recognize some of the terrain of these works, such as how technology shapes culture, the roots of religion, and the direction of history.  Even more than the Cantos, Simmons here delves deep into some of the West's finest literature, ranging from Shakespeare to Proust to Homer, but Cantos fans need not fear, Keats does make an appearance.   <br /> <br />Far from retreating after the magisterial Hyperion, with Illium/Olympos Simmons if anything reaches to embrace a story of an even more epic scope.  Building a world 500 years in the future would challenge any author.  Here the author ranges over thousands of year, from the battle for Troy to the very far future.  Indeed the plots many strings can be daunting to follow for even the most dedicated reader.  Several of the reviews demonstrate the challenge, as they claim as unanswered questions that the novel clearly answers, albeit buried within the novel's almost 700 pages.  After reading I found only one such dangling thread, and considered a minor annoyance at best. My complaint in contrast is that he often glosses over subjects that would surely fascinate any reader, but every writer must make choices.  That Simmons resists the temptation to stop the action for greater detail is probably to his credit, as it would surely detract from his efforts to keep the complex plot moving apace.   <br /> <br />Fans of Hyperion should not be scared off by some of those who complain about this series.  Simmons continues to offer more food for thought and discussion then almost any fiction writer working today.  If here he failed to reach the very peak of Olympos, the summit was surely well within his sight.   <br />	2005-08-01

In my memory, Alter's is the first. <br /> <br />Robert Alter, perhaps the leading American Hebraist and an outstanding translator, here delivers the reader a thoughtful and fascinating new translation of the Hebrew Bible.  Readers will quickly recognize Alter's position as one of the leaders of those who read the Bible as literature.  Some may quibble with his decision to occasionally deemphasize more historically based interpretations in favor of examining the text in terms of theme and poetics.  Thoughtful readers, however, find much worth learning in such analysis and would almost certainly also enjoy reading Everett Fox's also excellent and more historically based translation. <br /> <br />Of particular note, Alter's commentary and essays serve as wonderful background and offer readers not well versed in Hebrew a window into that languages internal intricacy.  For all of these reasons, no serious student should miss this important text.   <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-06-26

As someone of a similar age to his main character and having been raised in Brooklyn, I could not help but find his descriptions evocative.  As in his previous works, Lethem uses a powerful combination of imagery and finely crafted characters to carry us through his story.  Dylan the protagonist and his small world of Dean Street seem so real one could reach out and touch them.  Mingus Rude, Dylan's friend and neighbor, offers a powerful foil and often breaks your heart.  Indeed, Mingus will linger in my mind for some time as one of the great supporting characters of any novel I've read. <br /> <br />Two things in particular stand out in this work.  The first, Lethem's ability to use small details to draw deep lessons will be familiar to readers of his previous work.  An example I particularly liked is Dylan's artist father who paints movies, one frame at a time, creating master works that take days to complete seconds.  Another great success, Lethem's use of magic akin to the works of the great Latin American authors of the 20th Century deserves particular note and praise.  To his credit, the author succeeds where few before him have, folding this concept seamlessly into an American milieu. <br /> <br />If I offer any complaint on the book, it must be Lethem's apparent difficulty ending this magnificent novel.  In a work where I hungered for closure, I found myself with none.  This may well have been part of the lesson Lethem wished to communicate, but if it was, it was painful to learn.   <br />	2004-12-14
US	52584172	R14793N2IGV06P	076530158X	365011657	Dune: The Machine Crusade	Books	3	3	5	N	N	Strictly for fans	Brian Herbert writes this Dune prequel recounting the early history of his father's most fascinating universe under the claim that he and his co-author based the series on \\"extensive\\" notes and outlines left by Frank Herbert.  While I am not certain that I would not rather to have simply read Frank Herbert's notes, as a great fan of Dune and its sequels, I relish the opportunity to answer questions on the formation of this intricate universe and its complex society.  The Dune culture always left a series of questions in its wake, not the least of which being the story of its origins.  How did space folding, the Guild, the Sisterhood, and all of the other complex institutions come into existence?  How did there arise a high technology but basically feudal human society?  What were the \\"thinking machines?\\"  What happened to earth?   <br /> <br />Unfortunately, only diehard fans will be even more than faintly interested in the answers to these questions.  Others will find this novel and its predecessor dry, with flat characters, and amateurish stilted story telling.  Where Frank Herbert created compelling portraits of Great men and women, his son's work offers little more than sketches.  A few exceptions exist.  Norma, for example remains both interesting and entertaining.  Other pivotal characters, however, fall flat.  Vorian seems incomplete and often something out of a pulp story.  Compare this central character with the powerful and rich Leto, his distant descendant who dies off at the beginning of the first Dune novel yet whose complexity haunts the series next four books and credibly remains central for over 1,000 years. <br /> <br />Readers will continue to enjoy Frank Herbert's Dune for years to come.  His grand world invites one to savor and revisit.  The world his son paints, however, is worth visiting only to answer some outstanding questions.  If you were not enthralled by Dune, you are better off rereading that master work and skipping this rather skimpy mere curiosity of a book.   <br />	2004-10-06
US	52584172	R1CLUF19ETNRVN	0060934417	546555129	Bel Canto	Books	5	3	3	N	N	Thoughtful and ethereal	With Bel Canto, Ann Patchett can rest easy having proven herself as one of America's most able writers of prose. To her credit she did not, as her recent powerful work, &quot;Truth and Beauty&quot; clearly proves. While Belo Canto seems to be suffering here under the weight of considerable negative reviews, these to me seem more related to matters of stylistic preference, rather than being actual indictments of this extremely engrossing and occasionally tear bringing page turner. <br />  <br /> As said by others, Bel Canto takes place in an unnamed South American nation where guests to a birthday party thrown for a Japanese businessman in the hopes of wooing a factory are seized by rebels. Without giving up any of the books delectable little treats (like why the president is not in attendance at this all important affair) it is worth noting that much of the story derives from a similar actual event that took place in Peru. Once the guests are taken, Patchett serves up the real meat of this novel to the reader, the complex relationships between the rebels and their prisoners, as well with each other.  <br />  <br /> Each character is in their own way delicious, from the Japanese businessman who more loves opera than the fortune he's amassed, to the Swiss negotiator trapped in his role because he happened to be in the unnamed country on vacation. Patchett builds every chanter with the care and attention to detail of a master architect and her gift as a writer shines in her offering of an omnipotent narrator that lets us peer into the minds and hearts of each. The works pace is leisurely, but again this is both purposeful and poignant as the author takes the reader through the hostages and hostage takers endless and seemingly identical days, all the while unaware how much they changing and how little time they have left. <br />  <br /> Some reviewers here complain that little happens in the novel. For myself I can only assume those holding this view to be careless readers. All of Patchett's characters are altered profoundly through their experience and in her gifted style; we see this even if they don't. Again, simply may not like Patchett's ethereal style that often resembles South American mystical fiction, but for those who can appreciate this journey, it is well worth taking the trip.  <br />	2004-07-27

Halter, an able writer, seems particularly interested in the internal workings of these female characters, giving them a voice.  As an undertaking this is worthwhile as it expands the text and offers an interesting view into these individuals inner lives.<br />Some reviewers object to the licence Halter takes with Sarah's life, particularly as it relates to her being the daughter of a deposed king in Ur.  While there exists no basis in the text for this view, beyond Sarah's original name of Sari, Halter generally makes it work.  Moreover, his idea of making Sarah directly responsible for her own barrenness and using that as the central tension of the novel proves both interesting and gives the story considerable life.  Too often in biblical fiction authors place too little control in the hands of their characters and too much in the hands of an unseen divinity.<br />While I enjoyed that aspect of the novel, as well as the author's gift for incorperating archeological and anthrological details into the story, I found the novel fell short in a few ways.  Most interesting and perplexing is the author's choice to place the bulk of the story before the birth of Issac. Halter can obviously do as he chooses in his own work, but I felt a bit cheated at not seeing enough of Sarah as mother.<br />Nonetheless, Halter's prose remain contiunally excellent, particularly how he switches from the first to the third person almost seamlessly.  Over all, an enjoyable and worth while read.<br />That said, I would be remiss not to make a point regarding the issue of Sarah's relationship status as it relates to Abraham.  While it is true that Abraham claims Sarah to be his half sister when he speaks to Abimelech, the text is silent when it comes to his veracity.  Also, he does not make this same claim to Pharoh in the same instance.  Moreover, the Abraham story mirrors a simmilar story when his son meets Abimelech and claims his wife as his sister.  While the hebrew is somewhat ambiguous on the point, most Jewish cometators dating back centuries actually look to Genesis 12:29 to prove Sarah's father was Harran, making her Abraham's neice. Again, the text, however, remains unclear on the point.	2004-05-31

While his prose remain reasonable and crisp, his characters here become rather flat.  Card's novel rendition of the first matriarch Sarah falls short for the reason much biblical fiction fails, the desire to turn the characters into paragons.  Here Abraham is allways the perfect husband and the perfect servant of the Lord.  Sarah's faith strays, but never for more than a sentence before it whips back into a state of spiritual perfection.  Even the character's who serve as antagoinists, Hagar for example, never come to life.<br />The result is unfortunate.  The novel becomes deadly dull as we read how varrious saintly characters interact, except when a character is not a saint, in which case they are quickly forgiven.  Conflict and genunie doubt are, at all times, here kept at a minimum.  <br />The most interesting thing about this book is the way it presents the Mormon perspective on the story of Genesis.  Here Abraham, far from the first monotheist, is the carrier of ancient wisdom handed down along a direct line form Noah.  This non-textual take is common among Mormon readings.  However, it hardly makes this rather dull read worth the effort.	2004-05-25

An impressive survivor, he continues to command considerable power and clout despite the countless times his adversaries have declared him irrelevant.  With this in mind, Rubin and Rubin have done students of the Middle East a great service with this able biography, by far the most complete of the five so far published.  The authors track Arafat from his student days in Egypt, through his transition from one of the founders of modern terrorism to a leader commanding considerable respect on the world stage. The authors offer considerable analysis of his most fateful and often disastrous decisions, from attempting to overthrow the king of Jordan that led to the so called Black September Massacre, to his decision to back Saddam Hussein in the first gulf war.  Through all of this a telling portrait of Arafat emerges, though not one that his acolytes would necessarily appreciate.<br />Arafat's ability to play world powers off each other, first the Soviets off the US and now the Europeans off the US, is justifiably legendary.  The authors do an excellent job explaining how he does this, understanding the essential goals of each and inserting himself into their strategy.  What emerges is a man whose greatest concern is not his people, but his role in history and that he should never be seen as &quot;the traitor who made peace with the Jews.&quot;  Indeed, he is quoted when he rejected the Camp David Accords that he did not want to be the man who was seen as accepting the Jewish States right to exist. The Rubin?s do not seek to turn Arafat into some sort of evil monster, but rather to put him in the context of his culture, his times, and his values.  From this perspective, his motivations and actions become not only clear, but quite calculating and shrewd.  <br />The most interesting of the authors' conclusions is that through out his long career, Arafat may have changed tactics, but that his strategyand goals remain virtually unchanged.  Going back to the early 70's Arafat freely spoke of the idea of establishing a presence on some portion of the land between the Mediterranean and the Jordan by any means and then using it as a base from which to attack, demoralize, and eventually destroy the Jewish State.  Given recent events it seems the world would have done well to listen to what he had to say.	2004-02-04

Questions regarding the narrowness of her experience may be legitimate, but they still offer a telling look at the trouble modern Muslims face trying to integrate their faith into their modern life style.<br />Many can question how Islam reached its current position, but despite its position as one of the world's fastest growing religion, Manji is correct that it faces a crisis. The largest funders of Islamic proselytizing and scholarship -- Persian gulf petrol dollars -- also represent the faiths most conservative elements.  Not surprisingly, they often conflate ancient Arabian social custom with articles of Islamic faith causing substantial regression towards misogynist and anti-democratic principles.  Here she offers ample evidence such as books donated by Saudi Arabian charities to Islamic primary schools, which contain blanket vitriolic attacks on America, the West, and Jews.  <br />This analysis dovetails well with the question she raises about what effect the large number of repressive authoritarian governments in Islamic countries has on the faith. Here argument that changes in Islam will have to come from Western Muslims is interesting, though she does not do enough to ask how they can gain sufficient legitimacy to bring about such change.  <BR> <BR>Manji's most frightening observations and probably the most often attacked are her observations regarding the current Middle East crisis.  In current charged times these are hot button issues, but her analysis adds a much needed element to the current debate.  One need only look at the lionization in the Islamic world of suicide bombers who murder civilians to understand that this faith faces a grave threat of descending into nihilism. This death cult, hardly limited to the West Bank and Gaza posses grave risk for all Islam.  <br />Manji's thesis, that Islam must embrace some sort of reformation as other faiths have, should not be dismissed out of hand. Many may find her analysis disturbing and particular diagnosis flawed, but its hard to deny the existence of a problem.	2004-01-27

Hardly an expert in the subject, Armstrong's work offers what might best are considered an idealists view of Islam, often bending over to avoid critical analysis and paint the faith in the best light.  In some cases, this is quite refreshing, like pointing out Islam's extraordinary history as one of the worlds most enlightened and intellectual empires in the middle Ages.  The flowering of scholarship, art, and science, as well as Islam's role in preserving the works of the ancient Greeks that were often being burned in the west, deserves attention.  The weakness of her work is that, while she puts the distant past in context, she stubbornly refuses to do likewise in her analysis of recent history.  <br />Looking at ancient Islam, Armstrong is surely correct that Mohammed must be looked at in his context, the product of an extremely violent, patriarchic, clan based society with a thoroughly different concept of rights and justice then we have today.  However, her examination of the last 2-300 years of Islam fails to analyze the factors that brought one of the world's most enlightened and advanced societies to its current state.  Some obviously will complain that this conflates Islam and Arabic society, but as many scholars already point out the latter sprung from the former and is indelibly marked by that lineage.  In any case, the fact that the area of the world from Morocco to Pakistan boasts not a single democratically elected government or society allowing freedom of expression (excepting, of course, Israel) speaks volumes about Islam's current position.<br />Armstrong, however, does not wish to see the state of the people living in this region as having anything to do with Islam.  Nor does she offer sufficient analysis of the increasing spread of the most intolerant and peculiarist forms of Islam through schools funded byPersian Gulf petrol dollars.  Madrasha springing up from Chicago to Pakistan endowed by the Saudi are making Islam less tolerant and more retrograde.  Armstrong also has a problem with fact checking, such as her assertion that the west &quot;stole&quot; the Suez Canal.  Readers looking for a more scholarly and thoughtful view of Islam should examine the works of Professor Bernard Lewis, one of the leading scholars of Islam and the Arab world.  <br />Islam as a faith offers much to admire and find beautiful.  However, Islam is currently a faith at a crossroads that must either descend into its past or find a way to integrate itself into the modern milieu.  Will Islam find a way to coexist with modern notions of equality, democracy, and human dignity?  The question remains open.  This Herculean task will only be accomplishable with careful open eyed analysis.  White washes do a grave disservice to this critical question.	2004-01-27

Many readers have found his work daunting and given up, but those who persevered discovered a world where magic and passion reigned. With Oprah Winery's choice of Marques's most famous work, \\"One Hundred Years of Solitude\\" for her book club, I can only hope that readers will not stop there and will continue on to his other works.  \\"The General and His Labyrinth\\" would make an excellent stop for those wanting to further explore this author's imagination.<br />The work follows Simon Bolivar, the liberator of his South America, as he wanders towards an early grave, destitute and nearly friendless.  Through this lens Marques examines the idea of loss, futility, dreaming, desire, friendship, and humanity.  As a man who achieves so much but ends with so little, Bolivar's life makes an excellent cautionary metaphor for modern society.  Readers will find little of the humor this author so cleverly places in his other work, but his style remains both unique and haunting. Marques here builds a complex and perplexing world and when the reader becomes confused, it is because that was the authors goal.<br />\\"General\\" is quite a bit shorter than most of Marques's other works, but his powerful language and masterful imagery rings out from the page.  Bolivar has a long and painful trip to take and you will not regret deciding to join him.	2004-01-22

Other works in this same category include Invisible Man, anything by Dostoyevsky, anything by Tolstoy... well you get the idea.<br />Gatsby, with its tight almost terse language, complex relationships, and subtle imagery places it among the great works of American literature.  Its subject, wanting and loss, are feelings with which Fitzgerald was intimately familiar.  Tragically, many people were turned off to this work as teens when they could not yet understand its multi layered emotional landscape.  Hopefully, some of them return to the book as adults so that they can experience a real reading pleasure. Fitzgerald died young, but he left the world a master work.	2004-01-22

Hamilton edited this collection in a very conservative social mileu, and chose to edit out and play down much of the sex and violence one typically finds in the greek myths.  However, that choice makes it an excellent selection to give teens and pre-teens their first introduction to the world of Zues, Perseus, Hercules, and the rest.<br />Several other intructory books on myths are available, but this remains the classic.  Other less sanitized collections, however, are probably better for older readers.<br />The myths are well presented and organized.  A short section on Norse myth, though prefunctory and not Hamilton's speciality, provides in theresting contrast and good fun for young readers.  The essays included are good, though not the books greatest strength.  They are nontheless worthwhile as they sketch out the complex interrelationships between the greek gods and heroes offering the reader substantial intellectual stimulation.	2004-01-22

In the hands of a lesser writer, the novel would become a kind of interstellar version of British 19th Century gone to sea novels.  Heinlein, however, uses it as a platform from which to engage in a biting and thoughtful commentary on the state of society in 1959.<br />Here we are offered an interesting theory of citizenship, the relationship between violence and political power, and the idea of rights.

The strong evidence he offers, presented in a well thought out fashion, invites those who disagree to make a counter case based on something other than accusing him of being a liberal.  Judging on the smattering of come backs offered here, it seems they have an up hill fight.<br />Conason points to several areas that the GOP offers often repeated sound bites that bare little resemblance to reality.  His case about the GOP claiming to be a free market party is a case in point.  Rather than letting the market rule as Barry Goldwater might have advocated, Conason offers case after case of Republicans choosing winners and losers, showering tax dollar largess on favored companies.  Not surprisingly, these are more often than not companies that donate generously to the GOP.<br />If anything, some of Conason's charges seem to becoming truer, such as the notion that the GOP is the party of fiscal rectitude, given the White House and Congressional leaderships hunger to cut taxes AND boost spending, all in the face of a sky rocketing deficit.  Yet, the GOP continues to claim to be the party of strong fiscal discipline.  Interestingly, recent polling shows them losing ground on this point, as voters increasingly give Democrats higher marks than Republicans for economic stewardship.<br />Of course the most famous of White House lies continue to be about tax cuts.  During Bush's election it was the claim that you could cut taxes, increase spending and save social security without exploding the debt.  Now it is that most of the tax cuts benefit the middle class (palpably and provably inaccurate) and that the tax cuts have nothing to do with the rising deficit.  The GOP often also commits sins of omission, as with calling the inheritance tax the \\"death tax\\" without ever mentioning that only the richest half of one percent of American estates will ever need to pay.<br />As a reporter Conason's particular interest is the charge of a liberal media bias.  The fact that the Republican's economic chicanery receives such scant attention should be proof enough.  One needs little imagination to think of attacks a liberal Fox News might make on the President to realize the absurdity of the claim.<br />The most powerful case in this book regards the Republicans growing and dangerous inclination to accuse any who disagree with them for being unpatriotic, or as in the case of a certain GOP mouth piece, of being traitors.  This dangerous tendency towards demonization indicates a frightening willingness to damage democratic institutions in order to hold power.  Not in this book but elsewhere Conason put it well when he said that the GOP increasingly seems to be a party not interested in governing, but in ruling.<br />Conason's style occasionally moves from thoughtful to preachy and pedantic, a problem a good editor might well have dealt with prior to publication.  Despite these stylistic flaws, his case is a strong and frightening one.  Citizens would do well to read and take note before casting their ballot in November.g that only the richest half of one percent of American estates will ever need to pay.<br />As a reporter Conason's particular interest is the charge of a liberal media bias.

Looking at how authors write the future tells us a great deal, perhaps more, about the time that they lived then the time they are trying to create.  Heinlein's \\"Stranger in a Strange Land\\" is a case in point.  Ostensively about the 21st century it offers a facinating view into the 1960's, the era in which it was first published.  The fact many tarred it as scandolous at its first appearence while at the same time the book was widely read gives us powerful insights into the counter culture revolution and the radical changes in values that we feel down to this very day.  Moreover, \\"Stranger\\" opened the way for serious science fiction as social comentary, a debt for which all current writers in the genre owe Heinlein mightily.<br />Using as his voice Michael, the sole survivor of a mars mission on which he was born, Heinlein presents powerful if somewhat data critiques of western culture, from art, to religion, to sex, to government.  Raised by martians, Michael is a stranger to earth's culture and therefore an outsider.  Readers with an interest in Heinlein's evolution would enjoy comparing Michael with the author's other favorite voice, the undying Lazurus Long of Methusalah's Children as well as all his later works.  The difference in tone is striking, as is the fact that the ultimate cynic and the ultimate innocent come to almost all of the same conclusions, though the former has a better sense of humor.<br />Readers may choose between two versions of the book, the one released in 1961 and a longer (an additional 50,000+) words that was released much later.  Heinlein cut the material at his editors request and in my opinion the editor was right as the longer version drags and interfers with what is already ocassionally a slow story. Still, for those who like Heinlein this work cannot be missed.	2004-01-15
US	52584172	R2RJDDNF1BSDI1	0785109609	885504710	The Ultimates Vol. 1: Super-Human	Books	3	5	9	N	N	Not Millar's best work	Creating an adult superhero comic offers a writer a great challenge, one that Millar generally rose to in his work in Authority.  However, reimagining superhero icons into an adult paradigm remains one of the hardest things for any creator.  More than just upping the sex and violence, the writer must extend the characters in an organic fashion, deepening their relationships and personalities while at the same time remaining true to the hero's basic historic nature. Simply recreating the character anew without tying it back into the old core does not work, because one might just as well create a new character.<br />Millar succeeded admirably in such an effort with his much acclaimed Red Son.  While in some cases he takes his characters into interesting and deep new territory firmly rooted in the universe, in others his flights of fancy render the characters basically unrecognizable beyond some icon.  The best example of this failure is Millar's turning Thor into an environmentalist hippy.  What does this character have to do with the Asgardian who has graced Marvel for so long?  A Hammer?  Thor's nature is far deeper and more complex than the phallic symbol he swings.  Creating an adult Thor while remaining true to the original no doubt is a challenge, but one that could have offered readers a fascinating view into a complex character.<br />The same is true of Millar's Nick Fury.  Fury is not an eye patch.  Other recent work explored the character in interesting ways, but here he is simply a brand new character sporting a totem of the old.  To my mind that fails in what makes adult remaining interesting.<br />Other parts of the book do hold up.  Exploring the tension between Dr. Pym and Wasp as well as the formers many faceted personality is well executed here.  That their relationship might have violent components is not too much of a stretch from their old passions. Captain America is also well done.  As for Iron Man, the review is mixed, because while the character is interesting, it gives me a whole new character rather than a new view on the complex old one.<br />As a book for a new young comic reader, this is pretty good.  However, do not expect to be blown away by new depth added to old marvel favorites.  While a good read, it is not in the leagues with Morrisons X-Men or Rosss Marvels and Kingdom Come.	2004-01-14

Continuities like Marvel and DC cover such vast and varied terrain of time, space, and dimension that conceiving of a unifying story seems almost impossible.  Indeed previous efforts, like the sophomoric Secret Wars series in Marvel or the rather more effective yet still limited Crisis in DC seemed to demonstrate nothing so much as the impossibility of the task.<br />Alex Ross and company in this work prove that with tremendous talent and effort one can truly bring together the entirety of Marvel's complex continuity.  Some readers complain about the occasionally serpentine plot of this work and I must agree I found it rather hard to follow when I read it as individual issues.  However, when brought together and read as a single work, one realizes the depth of Earth X.  Moreover, despite the story's Homeric quality it never looses sight of the basic theme that runs through the Marvel Universe, the basic humanity of all its characters.<br />One has to be impressed as some of the more diverse and often forgotten characters such as Rom the Space Knight (here carefully and cleverly presented for reasons of trade mark) play a role in the epic story.  What I like most however is how in this work Ross, as in Marvels and Kingdom Come, captures the essences of the heroes both in image and story.  Spiderman's humanity, Captain America's idealism, Scott Summer's desire to live up to a father figure's exacting standards all appear as these much loved characters face a world much changed yet still familiar.<br />It goes without saying that as with all of Ross's other work, the painted pages jump out at the reader brining the story to life.  Here we have a graphic novel that brings an entire universe to a whole new adult level.	2004-01-14

In a multi media medium like comics, moving to an adult level requires elevating every component.  In his magnificent painted work, Ross does just that, offering true art and bringing these deep characters to life.  The choice of titles, &quot;Mythology&quot; proves prescient, for that is exactly what Ross does to the mythic DC characters of Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, and the rest.  This stands in sharp contrast to his work in Marvels, which does not appear in this collection, where he emphasizes the Marvel characters gritty humanity.  While his flexibility allows him to do either scale, his style better suits the more mythological and epic milieu of DC lore.  <br />Ross contributes mightily to the stories he illustrates.  Each character remains distinctive for reasons beyond the logo on their chests.  Wonder Woman's pride, Batman's determination, Superman's essential naiveté, all show through in Ross's work.  Indeed, who can forget his work in Kingdom Come where he literally created a new universe of characters?  With each brush stroke, brings his art leaping off the page and into the readers mind. <br />Any adult lover of comics will delight in this tremendous collection of one the genres living masters.	2004-01-13

Mel Gibson's Braveheart, with its exciting over dramatized life of William Wallace, another great Scottish hero, does a disservice to this Scottish patriot who succeeded in driving the British out of Scotland and restoring his nation's independence.  Far from the rather weak leader in Gibson's film, Robert was a strategic and tactical genius, both in war and in politics.  Moreover, one can only be struck how, in the age before mass warfare, his individual prowess at arms turned the tide of battle in several key skirmishes.<br />Scott offers an excellent view into Robert's life in this short work.  His background on Scotland is generally excellent and he does a good job brining several of Robert's cohorts to like -- a particular favorite of mine being Sir James Douglas, otherwise known as Black Douglas, who used clever strategy to kill out every English noble who dared take possession of his ancestral home.  Other characters like King Edward and Robert's brother are also well flushed out.<br />The weakness of this work, likely owing to its small size at 250 pages, is that it does not offer more of these in depth character portraits.  The work could also have used more background placing England and Scotland into the European milieu of the period.  Particularly vexing was the relative lack of maps, confusing when you are trying to follow Robert's exploits as he moves through every small town in Scotland.<br />Despite these short comings, I still give this book strong recommendations for anyone looking for a good read on one of history's most brilliant diplomats and military commanders who is too often overlooked.  Hopefully this work will correct the deficiency and give Robert the Bruce the appreciation he deserves, maybe even his own movie?	2004-01-06

The author reviews the major movements, such as the Ebionites who as Jewish-Christians who saw Jesus as fully Human, the Marcions who rejected the notion that the deity of the Hebrew Bible could be the one of which Jesus spoke, and the Gnostics who saw the material world as unredeemably flawed and saw Jesus as a messenger carrying the secrets of how to redeem the spirit.  Each of these movements deserve a several volume treatment, however, given his space limitations Ehrman offers a reasonable thumbnail sketch of each.  <br />That said, not all of his treatments are equally strong.  He shines in his review of the Gnostic movement, offering a strong brief description of its basic tenants and myth structure. Unfortunately, he can only review a few of the Gnostic sects, which many scholars believe where both diverse and widespread.  He also takes the position that the pro-orthodox Christians (those that became Catholic) successfully wiped out Gnosticism in antiquity.  Many scholars disagree with this position, believing that Gnostic movements survived underground at least until the Middle Ages, offering as proof several popular medieval heresies that were clearly Gnostic in nature.<br />His review of the Ebionites offers a good basic foundation in those who believed that Jesus was the fully human Jewish messiah spoken of in scripture.  Again, however, Ehrman's description is too brief.<br />The real weakness of the text is in the treatment of the struggle and eventual victory of the proto-orthodox movement.  One cannot summarize the complexity of late pagan Rome in a mere 300 pages, let alone while dealing with a host of other topics.  Thus, while Ehrman offers a good sketch, it remains little more than that.  He has no room to consider the influence of popular pagan cults such as Mithras and Isis on nascent Christianity's theology.  He also cannot deal at any length with the immense popularity of Judaism through the empire (Judaism was a proselytizing faith in this period) as well as the large number of non-Jews who did not convert but participated to various degrees in Jewish life, and the fertile ground this created for the new faith.<br />Ehrman also has a rather irksome habit of making statements without offering enough-- or even any -- supporting evidence.  As an example, his treatment of the reasons and methods of detection of early Christian forgeries is one of the text's most interesting sections.  The idea of producing forged works purported to be from those close to Jesus is a fascinating topic worthy of careful study.  So to is the idea that texts were often altered, such as the various endings offered for the Gospel of Mark, in order to defend a particular theological view.<br />Unfortunately, perhaps due to space limitations, Ehrman too often declares texts forgeries and offers estimated dates for their production without offering any evidence or argument as a basis for the position.  Thus some Scholars date the Gnostic Gospel of Thomas, a series of sayings attributed to Jesus to the mid first century.  Ehrman places it in the late second century.  Those hundred years represent a world of difference for how we should read the text.  Ehrman's offering of a date without a defense of his position does the reader a disservice, and one that he repeats again in several other places with other texts.  I hoped that he corrected this with his introduction to the individual texts in his companion work, &quot;Lost Scriptures,&quot; but was disappointed to find that he does not; offering again dates without a basis.<br />Despite these flaws, I still give this book a high rating.  Readers looking for an accessible introduction to the subject will find just that.  I only wish the author offered a larger and deeper alternative text, or a suggested reading list for those hungry for more.	2003-12-31

The translations, generally excellent, allow the reader considerable access to the period.  Unfortunately, the introductory essays for each of the writings are not up to snuff, often terse and providing little background.  While the author clearly intendended this as a companion addition to his other volume on early christian sects, the introductions should have been stronger.  Particullarly vexing is that, as in the other volume, he dates varrious writings without laying out the reasoning for the date given.  &quot;Scholars estimate...&quot;, a term repeated frequently, leaves the reader wanting more details and a hearing of the case.<br />Despite this short coming, a collection like this is a must for anyone interested in christian antiquity.	2003-12-30

Thornton, himself not Latin, brings to life the pain and hopelessness of those whose relatives would disapear under the military's rule and who had no one to whom they could turn.<br />In colorful language that seems to flow off the page and into your heart, he creates a world so real that you feel like you know the depth that these characters suffer. Magical realism can be extremely dificult to write as it often fails to hold the reader.  Exactly the opposite is true of this wonderful novel.	2003-12-18

Hoffman's other works include an expose on how Jews really worship Satan and an examination of how the people who really suffered during Slavery in North America were white slaves!?!?!?  Please, check on Amazon.  Who could make this stuff up?<br />This work, which comes in at a thin 110 pages, makes up for its faint size with a host of mistatements and simply wrong facts.  Dates, places, and death counts are often wrong, even when compared with both the work of Israeli and Palestinian scholars.  How hard could it be to fact check a 110 page book?<br />Several rediculous claims peper this book.  The authors claim Israel systamatically destroys Christian holy places -- a throw back to Hoffman's other work claiming that Jews are religously comanded to destroy christianity.  The trouble is that, from 1948 to the present, they can't document any instances of this in Israel.  Anyone interested in their claims will find it impossible to find supporting sources.  As in his other works, when Hoffman needs a fact that fits his point of view, he does not believe in wasting his time with research when he can simply make one up.<br />Both authors seek to drive towards a patently absurd premise, that it is the goal of the Israeli government to murder every Palestinian living in the West Bank and Gaza.  A simple look at the facts will demonstrate how patently false that claim is.  Granted 3000 palestinians have died in the current Israeli-Palestinian conflict.  However, given that Israel possesses the most powerful military in the region, you would think they would be more efficient in reaching their goal.  <br />People really interested in the Middle East can look at a host of interesting works that take positions supporting either side of the conflict.  Trash like this should be left to those who are just looking to justify their own irrational hatred and fear of Jews.	2003-12-18

David Hirst, a writer for the notoriously anti-Israel Guardian newspaper, here presents a work that can only be described as off the mark.  Hirst pulls out all of the old canards about the Arab-Israeli conflict, turning the Jews into the perfect aggressors and the Arabs into the perfect victim.  Sadly, the reality of the situation to any interested observer is far from so black and white.<br /><br />Hirst argues that Palestinians want to live in peace with Israel.  He even goes so far as to try to paint Yasser Arafat, a man who continues to urge young boys and girls to strap bombs to themselves and go blow up buses, as a peace maker.  The problem, of course, is that even many Arabs these days admit that Arafat is more of a hindrance to peace than a help.  His corrupt regime lines his pockets (including a wife living in the lap of luxury in Paris) and those of his cronies while he cynically maintains the conflict so that he has an excuse for his failed autocratic rule.  In the end, Arafat proved to be not a peacemaker, but just another Arab autocrat, as if the world really needed more of that particular breed.<br /><br />Moreover, Hirst's historic review is intentionally drawn to paint not just Israel, but Jews  in a bad light.  For example, the massacre of almost a hundred Jews living in Hebron in the 1920s, whose families could be traced back over a two thousand year continual presence is basically ignored.  When discussing \\"historic Palestine\\" Hirst ignores that this originally included Jordan until the British carved out the Hashemite Kingdom.  Thus far from his overblown and misleading numbers, the Jewish state represents less than 25% of \\"historic Palestine.\\"  Indeed, if Arafat accepted the Camp David Accords and became the President of Palestine, Arabs would control over 75% of \\"historic Palestine.\\"  And as far as that term goes, one should well remember that \\"Palestine\\" as any sort of political entity came into existence when the Romans reached back into ancient history to try to erase the recently demolished Jewish State after the Jewish revolt and then vanished, only to reemerge when another Empire -- this time British -- reached again back into antiquity to name a brand new colonial entity.<br /><br />Even in its own time Hirst's work was woefully out of date.  Shortly after its publication in 1977, Israel returned the Sinai representing more than 2/3 of the territory under its control, to Egypt in exchange for a peace treaty. This is hardly the work of the nation bent on conquest that Hirst wants to paint.<br /><br />Even in 1977 Hirst's work was shameful to the degree that he apologized for every act of terror.  Kosher restaurants blown up in Paris by Yasser Arafat?  Hirst blames the Jews.  An airport attacked and dozens of tourists killed by the PLO?  Hirst blames the Jews.

This idea has no greater proof than Baylis Thomas's &quot;How Israel was Won,&quot; which claims to be a &quot;concise history of the Arab-Israeli Conflict.&quot;  What is the author's approach?  A psychologist by trade, he puts Israel, indeed the Jewish people on the couch and seeks to explain how their psychological problems are to blame for the whole conflict!  Think I am joking?  Just look at some of the highlights of this &quot;work.&quot;<br />Thomas gives little attention to Palestinian and Arab violence against Israel.  In his analysis of conflict after the 1948 War he focuses on Israeli operations into the Jordanian controlled West Bank and ignores the Arab's frequent violent invasions of Israeli territory and their targeting of innocent Jewish civilians.  Similarly, in his analysis of the 1967 war, we are presented an unsupported and rather amateurish psychoanalysis of Egypt's President Nasser and of Israel, as though a nation could have a single consciousness, but no mention is made of Egypt's blockade of Israel's port in order to destroy the Israeli economy.  Anyone whose read Oren's ground breaking work on the Six Day War will be wondering how such flimsy scholarship ever got published.<br />The author similarly discounts Israel's efforts at peace making, including its willingness to make peace from 1948-67 for the Arabs to accept its right to exist.  Little attention is paid to Israel's offers to give up most or even all of the territory taken in 1967 in exchange for peace.  Indeed, Thomas is so hell bent on painting Israel in an evil light that he simply glosses over Israel's decision to give up more than 2/3 of its territory in exchange for making peace with Egypt, a deal that might well be called unprecedented in recorded history for a victorious power seeking a settlement.  <br />More bias is evident.  Israel is described as \\"balking\\" at UN Resolution 242 which calls on Israel to exchange territory for peace.  Slight problem of course - Israel voted for it and every single Arab state voted against it.  Indeed, as mentioned above, Israel surrendered territory as soon as a single Arab country was willing to make peace.  Of course for that heroic decision Sadat was vilified and eventually assassinated by his Arab brethren.  The book continues in this vein throughout.  Israel is blamed for the collapse of the Oslo Process, while no attention is paid to the Palestinians habit of denouncing violence in English, while at the same time continuing to send terrorists whom they lionize in Arabic.  Indeed, to date Arafat has renounced violence and terrorism in three separate accords, only return to form and send suicide bombers when he thinks it will serve his political ends.  Again, this for Thomas is at best a footnote and at worst seen as justifiable.<br />One of the most amazing things about this flimsy work is its almost complete dependence on secondary sources.  It seems the author could not be bothered to look at many primary sources so the reader is left with a bunch of unsupported and undefended assertions without any evidence to back them up.  Indeed, for those reviewers who like this book and defend its obvious bias as a &quot;counter weight&quot; to a perceived pro-Israel bias in publishing, just look at his bibliography.  Pages after pages of anti-Israel work are there for any to read, from Noam Chomsky and Said on down.  One wonders why it is people continue to maintain the myth that anti-Israel voices are so quiet.  From this work and its bibliography it seems more like a blaring shout.  Those looking to understand the conflict should look elsewhere.  Oren's Six Day War would be a good start.	2003-12-17

What makes his work more noteworthy and profound is that, more than a simple history, Lozowick's work is part memoir tracing his own path from an active and influential advocate for the Oslo peace process to a supporter of the current hawkish government.  What brought about these dramatic shifts in this thoughtful and well informed analyst? <br />Lozowick details the recent history and his own profound disappointment at the failure of the last peace process.  Particularly incensing for him is the insistence of the so-called \\"peace camp\\" in Europe in particular an to a lesser extent North America to write lengthy apologies for the suicide bombers who regularly murder civilians and children.  In the parlance of their European supporters, these acts of terrorism are more political statements then they are barbaric blood shed.<br />However, the heart of this work a defense of Israel against the attacks against the state's very legitimacy.  Here the author really shines.  The author makes short work of argument such as the idea that Israel is a racist state.  Lozowick points out that Arab citizens have all the rights and privileges of Jewish and Christian Israelis, moreover that they have a greater degree of political freedom and civil rights then citizens of any of the 22 Arab countries, including those living under Arafat's oppressive Palestinian Authority.<br />Lozowick goes further detailing how Israel's strong sense of morality has caused it to limit its responses in the face of terror and how little recognition this willingness receives.  For example, Palestinians in the first intifada had but did not use guns for fear that Israel would respond with the full force of its considerable military.  Detailing Palestinian material he demonstrates how surprised Palestinians were when, in the current uprising, Israel responded with only a tiny portion of the force at its disposal.<br />Indeed, this is one of the least discussed factors in the current conflict.  While Israel is continually criticized for supposed excesses, Israel uses a tiny portion of its military capability.  While Palestinian attacks are designed to maximize civilian casualties, Israeli attack on terrorists are focused on reducing them.  The often overlooked fact, is that Israel could likely kill most of the population of the West Bank with little effort and make their citizens far safer.  Less extreme, they could destroy whole villages which send suicide bombers to murder Israeli children.<br />They do not take such extreme measures, though they are common place in the reason.  Detractors of Israel say this is because of foreign pressure, though wonders how the Europeans and the UN could be more anti-Israel.  The real reason is Israel's profoundly moral sense of itself. Where else can a country's sworn enemies get a hearing in a Supreme Court that then orders limits to be placed on a military in war time?<br />Many other authors have written about the strange singling out of Israel among all the nations of the earth.  How the UN focuses more attention on Israel's behavior then any other member state and how alone among the nations, Israel is barred from serving on the Security Council while model countries such as Syria and Iran are allowed to hold the rotating chair.  Few writers, however, have achieved Lozowick's elegance in detailing the pernicious tendency to bend and twist facts, indeed the double standard created in order to condemn the Jewish State.<br />Thoughtful readers should give Lozowick's work a careful reading.  As for those who attack the Jewish State, he offers many challenges that they will need to answer if they wish to claim their position holds any legitimacy.	2003-12-17

That should be the rule placed on Michael Prior in his rather insipid and occasional shrill work of propaganda.  The very title betrays the arc for the entire storyline of his work; what other nation or national liberation movement needs to face a &quot;Moral inquiry?&quot;  Prior's work, so blatantly one sided that it is difficult to think people take this seriously, reads like nothing so much as a medieval passion play.  As in those terrible pieces of anti-Semitic history, Prior offers up the Jews as perfect villain and the Arabs and Palestinians as innocent, near angelic, victims.  His patronizing attitudes towards both is palpable throughout his work.<br />Prior does more than try his damndest to undermine the Jews historic attachment to Israel, a fact that prior to 1948 was recognized near universally by Christians and Muslims alike, but seeks to whitewash all of modern Arab history.  The endless terror visited on Jews in Israel, from programs and massacres in the 1920's through to the endless wave of terrorism that Jews in Israel now confront goes largely ignored.  His effort to paint Israel as a colonial movement ignores the Jews 2000 year attachment to the land of Israel, as well as the vibrant cultural, artistic, and scientific life that is present in the Jewish state.  Even the rebirth of the Jews own language, Hebrew, the sure sign of a distinct nation is given no attention.<br />Creating a separate standard for Jews and Israel from other people and nations is the hallmark of modern anti-Semitism.  That is in fact exactly what you see here.  What other people must defend not only their right to their nation, but their very right to exist?  Given Israel's position as the only democracy in the Middle East, indeed the only place in the region where Arabs can speak their minds and participate in an open political process without fear of the threat of violence, one does not need to make a leap to guessthe particular axe Prior intends to grind.  <br />Prior's relentless assault on truth and history is geared not to those who want to learn, but as propaganda at the ignorant and ammunition for those who hate Israel and the Jews.  As such, it deserves scant attention as anything other than a symbol of the rising wave of anti-Semitism now engulfing the Jewish people.	2003-12-17

Looking slavery through the eyes of individuals, the reader gains a far greater appreciation of the suffering, torment, and most of all, the fear generated by those who stood in opposition.  <br />Interesting also is the location the author focuses on, the Ohio River where on one side men are free and on the other live in chains.  Most texts present slavery at great distances, like The Carolinas an and New York.  Here we see just how intimate the slavery and the abolitionist could be and the blood spilled by both sides.<br />Most importantly, Hagedorn writes in a cool clear voice that is enjoyable and informative.  She delivers facts and passion in the same sentence without ever becoming melodramatic or shrill.  Readers who enjoy this fictional work may also want to look at &quot;Cloudsplitter,&quot; Richard Bank's novel on The Brown family's war on slavery.	2003-12-03

Look deeper; most of those who attack the book do not address the facts and figiures it contains, but the idea that the author is 'biased.' Of course biased is a word generally applied by people to those who hold an alternate point of view.  Case in point, who do many of the negative reviewers suggest for an unbiassed view? The noted Palestinian propagandist, the late Edward Said.  <br />So, how about the actual contents of this work?  Like all of the Idiot's Guides, Bard's work offers a cursory glance at the subject not a deep education.  Still, he covers the bases, from ancient history, through the birth of Islam and the colonial period right up to the present day.  Many oppose this view because they prefer Israel not be placed in an ancient historical context, but begining readers should understand the Jews historic attachment to the sliver of land between the Med Sea and the Jordan River.<br />The Maps and timelines are good and informative, though again, it does not go as deep as a reader seeking real expertise would need.  The author focuses most of his attention on the Arab-Israeli conflict, giving short shrift to the challenges facing Arab culture in a post Ottoman world where artifical nation states were created by europeans.  Readers interested in this subject should explore the work of Prof. Bernard Lewis, particularly the 'Middle East and the West' and his more recent work 'What Went Wrong?'<br />Bard does a good job presenting the outline of the current conflict and giving the reader a basic understanding of places, names, dates, and outstanding issues.  He Does offer both sides perspectives in their own words, though he does not take these statments at face value, often challenging positions that fly in the face of fact or reason.<br />Again, while this will not make a reader an expert, it gives a good basic background which is a good place to start.	2003-12-01
US	52584172	R3W4OFPRTN4PFX	0060542462	236101555	Never Again?: The Threat of the New Anti-Semitism	Books	4	21	32	N	N	An excellent work of scholarship, but does not go far enough	?Everywhere the Jew is hated,? Hertzel observed.  ?Either he is too wealthy or too indigent, too industrious or too lazy, to intelligent or too na?ve.?  His answer to the conundrum of the oldest hatred that despises the Jew for being anything, was to blame it on the Jews stateless status and propose the creation of a state as the cure.  So one wonders what irony Hertzel would find if alive in the fact that his People, whom he observed as hated for being stateless and are now just as reviled for now having one of their own?<br />In his book, ?Never Again?? Abraham Foxman does an admirable job documenting how the hatred of the Jew transcends politics, geography, and race.  Politically, Jews are hated from the right and the left, both in North America and in Europe.  Indeed, most striking is how these adversaries find common ground in opposing the Jewish state.  In Europe, where the political extremes disagree on everything else, they work together to plan demonstrations condemning Israel.  American White Supremacists seek legitimacy within the larger political circles by taking up the Palestinian cause.  Nor is this the end of the strange bedfellows the oldest hatred makes, as liberal on college campuses receive generous funding from some of the most repressive misogynist regimes on earth like Saudi Arabia, bonded by nothing other than their desire to see the destruction of the state of Israel.  <br />Foxman?s work examines what he terms the ?New Anti-Semitism? that condemns and attacks Israel in the most strident terms, yet recoils when accused of hating Jews.  On the left, the rhetoric is couched as anti-Americanism and anti-imperialism, on the right realpolitik.  The author deftly argues that it is this very singling out of the Jewish State for criticism, as well as the claim that Jews are alone among the nations in not deserving a state (an argument that recently appeared in a no less a pinnacle of American intellectualism as the New York Review of Books) an be called nothing other than anti-Semitism.  Why else does the world ignore repression the world over, much of it in the nations fastest to criticize Israel, and leap to attack the Jewish State?  Why has the UN almost never condemned any nation for their policies internal or external, while skewering Israel on a near monthly basis?  When the world exists with two standards, one for the Jewish state and one for all other nations, how can one describe it as anything other than traditional anti-Semitism moved from the level of the individual to that of international diplomacy?<br />?Never Again?? succeeds admirably for the author?s careful examination of the history of anti-Semitism examining subjects such as Jewish Catholic relations and the Muslim world?s increasing usage of ancient European bile such as blood liable and the Protocols of the Elders of Zion.  Foxman also tracks how traditional anti-Semitic charges continue to evolve to fit into newer models.  As the head of the ADL, Foxman knows of what he speaks and marshals a powerful case to describe how the hatred of Jews is currently spreading like a wildfire.  Nor does he simply rely on the ever growing list of hate crimes now spreading through Europe instead looking at his subject from a historical point of view.<br />The only failing of this otherwise excellent book is Foxman?s failure to postulate why the Jews are singled out among all the people for a hatred that has spread across the globe and goes back over 2,000 years.  While one can understand the authors nervousness at a subject where theories range from genetics to metaphysics, his lack of a theory appears as a glaring omission amongst his considerable data.  Further, while he gives a great deal of space to his sadness at how the murder of Six Million Jews failed to quench the fire of this hatred, he does not give enough credence to the idea that the hatred of the Jew is apparently mankind?s normative state.  Despite these failing, Foxman deserves credit for a thoughtful and well-written examination of the oldest hatred.  <br />Of course many will dismiss this work outright, repeating the old canard that they Israel and not Jews, a strange position espoused by many Arab terrorists who in their hatred of Israel blow up Kosher restaurants in Paris and Synagogues in Istanbul.  The best refutation of that rather cowardly position remains the words of Dr. Martin Luther King.  ?You declare my friends that you do not hate the Jew, but are merely ?anti-Zionists.?  And I say let the truth ring forth from the mountaintops.  When people critisize Zionism they mean Jews.  And what is ?anti-Zionism??  It is the denial to the Jewish people of a fundamental right that we justly claim for the people of Africa and freely accord all other nations of the globe.?	2003-11-30

Many reviewers assert that his views have changed from his ground breaking early work and accuse him of morphing into a neoconservative.  Readers of his seminal early work, such as the Middle East and the West, will know that this charge is far off base.<br />For decades Lewis, an admirer and expert on Islam, has made the same case for the underlying reasons for the decline of Islamic civilization, despite its ascendant status prior to the 15th Century.  As Islamic culture under the Ottoman's became increasingly phobic about innovations, its once leading position in the sciences declined precipitously.  Further reasons for scientific decline arose from the power of Islamic clergy and their opposition to foreign ideas while the West was advancing under the enlightenment.<br />Lewis also points out the advantages gained in the West from the growth of competing powerful entities which decentralized control.  A rising economic middle class and a rise of a stable capitalist class further advanced economic, scientific, and cultural life.  In contrast, Islamic culture remained highly centralized and, in particularly beginning in the 18th Century, showed increasing tendencies towards internal corruption within the bureaucracy.<br />Other reviewers attack Lewis for his focus on Ottoman culture.  However, these attackers miss a main point of his argument.  The ethnocentric Arabic self identity only began taking hold in the 19th Century and even then it was a tribal rather than ethnic locus.  The fall of the Ottoman Empire and the artificial states carved out by colonial Britain and France only further undermined the identity of the Arabs.<br />As for the central question of his title, &quot;What Went Wrong?&quot; Lewis can only offer a brief view of an answer in this short work.  However, Westerners need to understand that in the Arab world, across the political spectrum, from Nasser to Bin Laden, this question is asked everyday.  How to the preeminent civilization that a few centuries ago stood on the verge of overwhelming Europe and dominating the world find itself in its current humble state?  To survive in the modern world, westerners must take this question as seriously as Muslims do and try to find an answer.  <br />We are fortunate that Professor Lewis has been asking these questions for years.  We can all benefit from the insights he offers.	2003-11-25

Drawing on diverse sources, many in Arabic, he explains how Arafat never abandoned violence or his dream of destroying the Jewish state.  Indeed, Arafat's efforts in creating the cult of the suicide bombers and continually seeking to delegitimize Israel for his people, as well as his willingness to use violence and terror as negotiation tools have severely weakened the Palestinians credibility.  <br />Karsh also deserves credit for sympathizing with the Palestinian people, who Arafat betrays with his self serving leadership.  The author's coverage of Arafat's rejection of a state in 2000, when Israel offered him all of Gaza, 95% of the West Bank, and a shared Jerusalem is particularly thorough.  What emerges here is a portrait of a man primarily interested in the advancement of his own political faction and cronies over those of his people.  Karsh does an excellent job putting this in perspective as fairly standard behavior throughout the Middle East.<br />Unfortunately, while this book is recent, it was in the presses when recent revelations of Arafat's vast personal holdings, estimated at over $1 billion came to light.  So, while Karsh can present evidence of Arafat's personal enrichment through graft and embezzlement, he missed the opportunity to give the full story.  Nonetheless, Arafat's War remains a must read for any wishing to understand the conflict.	2003-11-20

His thesis is a simple one, that the press either cannot understand or is to lazy to realize the effects of the policies of the Bush White House.  Whatever you think about Krugman's decidedly and unapologetic left leaning slant, his arguments cannot and should not be ignored.<br />For example President Bush came into office arguing for a big tax cut tilted towards the wealthy as a remedy for a large surplus.  As the economy slowed and the surplus faded, it morphed into a remedy for a recession, even though many of its largest items, like ending the inherittence tax, have no stimulus value.<br />Moreover, Krugman charts a disturbing habbit of bait and switch retoric from the White House.  For example, the continual use of 9/11 as a basis for the Iraq War leading to a majority of Americans believing Sadam was behind the attack even though the President when cornered admitted that Iraq had nothing to do with it.  Or the continual insistence that the tax cut targets the middle class despite all the evidence to the contrary.<br />Krugman's work, more than anything else, is a cry for honesty from the white house and for the press to get up and actually do their job.	2003-11-19

What happens from there is a tremendous work in which master novelist Ian McEwan truly shines.  Both in substance and style, Atonement is nothing short of breath taking.  Through the narrative the author offers a window into topics ranging from Britain's fossilized class structure to methods of candy making during a chocolate shortage to the unspoken subject of sex in 1930's Britain.<br />McEwan further deserves praise for his complex and engaging character that pull you into the work.  Of particular interest is the author's excellent use of point of view, presenting an almost tragic farce as we see different events from a myriad of points of view most of whom fail to understand the reality of events.  Indeed, we see the depth of sadness that emerges when people assume that their point of view must be correct.  A sensitive reader's heart will break from the awful events that flow from these misunderstandings.<br />Lastly, I must comment on the author's tremendous ability to paint rich descriptions leaving the reader feeling they are actually present.  From the beach of Dunkirk to an aristocrat's estate, in every case you will want to stop and reread to experience again the beauty and depth of McEwan's language.  In short, any reader will be richer for the experience of following McEwan through this tremendous work.	2003-11-18

Here are a smatering of facts offered and myths dismissed:<br />*Israel continues to be the only country where Arab men and women are allowed to speak freely and vote in free and fair elections for candidates of thier own choice.<br />*The Arabs insist Israel give up the territory won in the 1967 war for a Palestinian State, without ever mentioning that Jordan and Egypt controlled these territories from '48-'67 without making a single move to give the Palestinians a country.<br />*Syria and Lebannon herd Palestinians into camps, denying them citizenship or the right to own property in order to win propaganda points.<br />*The Palestinians continue to reject Israel's offers to abandon the Gaza Strip and 95% of the West Bank in exchange for peace.<br />*The Arab war on Israel predates the ocupation of the west bank and gaza by almost two decades. <br />*During the 19 years of Jordanian rule of Jerusalem not a single Arab leader took the time to visit this so-called holy city.<br />*Unlike Israel, which defends all holy sites, the Jordanians detroyed 2000 year old Jewish cemeteries in Jerusalem, and the Palestinian Authority continues to destroy Jewish holy sites like Jacob's Tomb.<br />Everyone interested in the Middle East should first become aware of these facts.  Bards book cuts through the porpaganda giving the reader a view of the reality of the region and its history.	2003-11-14

The sheer volume of the proof he offers is so overwhelming that one wonders how any one could miss it.  In particular, he shows how the international press and the UN often times condemn Israel for practices that are ignored elsewhere.  For example, he goes to great lengths to demonstrate how Israel, the only nation in the Middle East where Arab citizens can vote in free and fair elections and speak freely is routinely condemned, everyone ignores the horrendous human rights of the other Middle East nations.  Why is only Israel attacked?  China, North Korea, Iran, Libya, Syria, Sudan get no attention in the UN who reserve their condemnation exclusively for the Jewish state.  <br />Dershowitz's point is simple; the world should function under a single set of rules.  Instead, Israel is continually the sole target of world condemnation.  Shockingly, countries like Syria and Libya are placed in important international positions like chairing international human rights convention and the Security Council from which they condemn Israel.  At the same time, Israel remains the only country in the world not allowed to sit on the Security Council.<br />Prof. Dershowitz's book's goal is not to prove Israel perfectly innocent.  Indeed, the many negative reviewers who make this claim have clearly not read the book and are simply parroting something they heard or read elsewhere.  With his skill as a courtroom lawyer he makes his case and makes it convincingly for anyone inclined to take the time read it.	2003-11-12

His work carefully considers the motivations of all the major players, offering insightful analysis of the decision makers in Tel Aviv, Cairo, Damascus, Washington, New York and Moscow.  <br />Unlike other works on the same topic Oren white washes no one, offering a reasonable and balanced view of the motications for all sides.  Of particular note for excellence is his placing of the war in the context of the larger Arab Israeli and Cold War currents that led to this point.  For example, how the Vietnam War made Washington want nothing so much as to defuse tensions.<br />Most interesting of all is Oren's explination of all that Israel did in order to avoid going to war, particularly in light of current arguments regarding Israel's control of the West Bank and Gaza.  All to often, advocates for the Palestinians want people to forget the near 20 years when both territories remained under Jordanian and Egyptian control, without the world ever demanding that they evacuate to create a Palestinan State.<br />Please note what the book is not.  While a fabulous history, the authors focus is diplomatic, not military.  Those looking for an excellent military history should look to Chaim Herzog's work, which is the standard.  However, for an understanding of background and motivations, Oren's work is nothing short of esential.	2003-11-11

At first, I was dubious that the subject could support such a lengthy work. Indeed, the writer in me kept looking for scenes that could be cut.  However, the author's skillful prose more than justifies the length, as he throughly explores the repercussions of the event that drives the books action.<br />As the father of a daughter, I felt brought into the protaganist's world, feeling his anguish and fear.  Some readers complain that the main character is unlikable, but I found his honest portrayal, flaws and all, quite refereshing.  One of the books strengths is its dutiful avoidance of saintish heroes and dasterdly villians, instead showing how every character experiences the story through the lens of his or her own shortcomings.  <br />Many other reviewers have written the basic outline of the story, so I won't repeat them.  Sufice to say that Goodwin's well polished prose and excellent use of the first person offers readers a moving and evocative view of loss, grief, and recovery.	2003-11-11

Here, Kugel examines a subject that, in his own words, is far thinner.  Looking at the Bible, particularly the Five Books of the Torah, he tries to gain insight into how Israel perceived G-d in the Biblical period.  He does not disappoint.  Examining the occasions when individuals encountered the divine or His messengers, Kugel builds a persuasive case that ancient Israelites understanding of the divine stands as remarkable different from what modern readers seek to project backwards through time.<br />Some may take offense at some of Kugel's assertions, that the ancient Israelites saw G-d as corporeal and did not embrace monotheism as early as modern interpreters argue.  However, the modern quirk projecting back modern concepts as far back as possible, while a comforting fiction, bellies our attempts to truly understand our ancestors.  The development of Monotheism, easily one of the greatest and most impactful achievements of human history, should not be taken for granted as something that came in a preverbal flash.<br />Kugel does a wonderful job presenting complex material in an accessible format.  His sensitivity to the potentially controversial thesis he espouses only further coxes the reader along for this fascinating journey.  People interested in this subject should also read Kugel's other work and consider reading the works of Bill Dever and Baruch Halperin, both also excellent.	2003-05-19

The first is a rather simple romantic, King and I story about an American girl swept up into royalty like Grace Kelly.  Sweetly, we hear how Noor, formerly known as Lisa Halaby, is courted and eventually married by the dashing young king Hussein, more than a decade here senior.  While this part of the book has considerable appeal, the second book, buried within the first, is far spottier.<br />Noor presents a one sided view of the Middle East that is at shockingly shallow, ignoring facts and making up new ones in pursuit of her goal of painting the more than 200 million Arabs as victims of fewer than 6 million Israelis.  The contortions she engages in to prove this thesis might be laughable, where it not for the fact that this book is being so widely marketed and read to readers for whom this will be there only exposure to the Middle East and the Arab Israeli conflict.  A few facts, ignored by Noor stand out as remarkable.<br />* No one doubts her husband; King Hussein was a great man who eventually came to be a man of peace.  However, in her effort to paint him as a moderate, she ignores the fact that he launched an aggressive attack on Israel in 1967, when he had not been attacked nor threatened or his willingness to let terrorists based in his territory murder dozens of innocent civilians in terrorist bombings.<br />* Blaming Israel for the plight of the Palestinians, without considering that her Husband and his uncle the former king ruled the West Bank from 1948-67 without showing any interest in giving the Palestinians a state of their own.  Her husband's killing of thousands of Palestinians in the so-called \\"Black September Massacre,\\" is likewise ignored.  <br />* Ignoring the well-documented overtures Israel made in the 60's to return most of the West Bank to Jordan in exchange for Peace.  Overtures ignored by her late husband who was too weak politically to make peace with Israel.  <br />*  Blaming Israel for the 22 Sheiks, Kings, and Despots who rule the 22 Arab countries including her husbands, rather than laying some of the blame on the Arab populations who so recently lionized a butcher like the Saddam Hussein.  <br />* Glossing over her Husband's strong support for Saddam Hussein in the '91 Gulf War.<br />The greatest obstacle to modernization in the Middle East is the ability of the Arab media and culture to construct new fictitious realities when the reality on the ground does not suit them.  Thus Israel is blamed for wide spread Arab poverty rather than corrupt regimes and suicide bombers who murder children can be easily labeled heroes.  Noor would do a far greater service speaking the truth to Arabs, including those who live under her son, the current King's, \\"enlightened\\" despotism, instead of presenting rehashed propaganda to American audiences.  Sadly, her loss of perspective is a loss to those who she claims to champion.  The Middle East is awash in poverty and tyranny; being at the top of the marble tower for so many years clearly distorts her view of the squalid street.	2003-04-22
US	52584172	R3IDAKGU7IOQEL	0679642811	448968193	The Crisis of Islam: Holy War and Unholy Terror	Books	5	205	239	N	N	A powerful examination, not for beginers	Bernard Lewis continues his lifetime devotion to teaching about the Middle East and Islamic culture in this all too thin volume.  As in his last book, What Went Wrong, here again Lewis focuses on raising the average readers understanding of this crucial region and its history.  Unlike many so called academics, who argue from polarized positions on CNN and FOX News, Lewis takes a complex and nuance approach to this most complex of regions.  Indeed, while everyone else seems to either want to condemn all Islam and its culture or apologize for the terrorists it currently inspires, this author writes from a position of respect and appreciation for this civilization all the while refusing to be blinded by base sentimentalism.  <br />Looking through Islamic history, Lewis explains how a preoccupation with a loss of status and power, a world view looking to blame outsiders rather than looking inward for critical self-examination, and a lack of democratic tradition, continues to radicalize the Middle East.  The author further seeks to explain how Islamic culture holds a different world view from those in the west and that we need to understand this world view if we are to confront the threat of terrorism.<br />Readers should be aware that this text is not an introduction.  Lewis does not write for laymen.  Assuming a certain baseline of knowledge, he tends to gloss over arguments or offer evidence in a sort of short hand, expecting the educated reader to understand references and names.  In a world where most non-fiction is over written, Lewis is a throw back to an earlier age, writing thin volumes that are light on detail and heavy on argument.  This does not detract from the quality of his work, but it does limit what a reader without a firm grasp of the fundamentals can learn from reading it.  Still, there is much to be learned from this work, in particular his examination of the Wahabbi sect being exported by Saudi Arabia and the traditional self understanding of Islamas an ascendant religion that would spread over the whole world.<br />Readers should also look to Lewiss earlier work, in particular the Middle East: A Brief History and Islam and the West, both essential reading for someone whishing to understand the modern Middle East.	2003-04-07

Therefore, I read the reviews of Oren's supposedly \\"ground breaking\\" work with a certain incredulity.  However, these accolades turned out to be well deserved.  Indeed, by brining new depth and breath to an old topic, Oren deserves a great deal of praise.<br />Unlike many of the previous works on this subject, Oren does not look to analyze a particular aspect of the conflict (e.g. Herzog's excellent military analysis of the war) but looks at it from several perspectives, including military, political, diplomatic, and cultural.  Moreover, Oren successfully recreates the web of relations between and amongst the major players, including Israel, the Arab States, the US, and the USSR.  Also fascinating are the explanations of the internal conflicts among the actors, particularly in Egypt and Israel.  The depth of research in this area has never been matched in an easily accessible work on this subject.<br />Some reviewers claim Oren favors one side or another.  I find this to hardly be the case.  Indeed, he is again noteworthy for both accurately displaying the foibles of both sides as well as dispelling several old charges that continue to haunt this conflict despite evidence easily dismissing them as false.  For example, Israel's early claim to Johnson that Egypt attacked first, or the Arab's patently absurd claim that the US and Britain participated in the attacks, a charge even the Soviet's refused to believe.  Also rejected are many of the claims made by apologists, such as the idea that Egypt's behavior was not provocative, when indeed they launched a blockade against Israel's only southern port in violation of international law.<br />Also, worth noting is Oren's description of the Liberty incident, which has aroused so much attention, generating much heat and little light.  The author successfully points out that Israel could have had no reason for attacking an American ship and thus provoking their only ally.  His description of the systemic failures that led to this tragedy is convincing while still not forgiving the mistakes that contributed to the tragedy.  Most interesting is that, once the Israelis realized that this was not an Egyptian flag ship supplying the destroyers shelling Tel Aviv, that they initially worried it might be a Russian supply ship and thus risked brining the Soviets into the conflict.<br />Good history is a rare treat to read.  Oren's wonderful book is exciting, informative, and a must read for any interested in the shaping of the modern Middle East.	2003-03-12

On these grounds alone, one must admire Nuland's honest assessment of his own situation growing up.  The embarrassment children of immigrants feel at their parent's attachment to their old lives and inability to adapt to the new.  The desire of the new generation to loose their ancestry and become truly American, contrasting with the older generations loss at never truly fitting in.  Nuland's account is touching and honest.  One feels for all of his characters deeply and cannot help but cry as many of the aspirations they share also pull them apart.  <br />Nuland's work can be read on two levels. The first, as an account of a particular group of immigrants, with all of their pain and joy brought to the fore through wonderfully poignant writing.  Second, one sees how the immigrant experience transcends any particular group, and that what ever their point of origin, all immigrants share common aspirations and fears when they arrive on these shores.  On either level, this brief page-turner is well worth your time.	2003-03-06

Kertzer, in this thoughtful and evocative examination of the Church's relationship with Jews, persuasively demonstrates that no reasonable reading of the history could conclude that the Church was so blameless.  Indeed, Kertzer's main evidence comes from the Church's own archives, carefully examining several hundred years of the Church's ongoing persecution of the Jews.<br />The work focuses on two distinct periods, the first when the Church ruled the Papal States, an area of Italy where the Pope exercised temporal as well as ecclesiastical control.  This region was almost certainly the most backward and oppressive towards Jews outside of Czarist Russia.  While the other European powers embraced modernity, the Church insisted on denying Jews basic civil rights and protections, forcing them to live in Ghettos, wear distinctive yellow stars, banned them from the professions and universities, and bared them from universities.  The Nazi Reich adopted all of these rules when it came to power in the 20th century.  Kertzer also examines how the Church hierarchy saw liberation and equality for Jews as one of modernity's great evils that should be thwarted all costs, even as it turned out, if it cost the Pope his temporal kingdom.<br />Kertzer then goes on to examine how after Italian unification denied the Pope his state, the church turned with a vengeance on Jewry, laying out in Catholic papers much of what would become the standard charges of modern anti-Semitism.  Jews are portrayed as bent on the murder of Christians to use their blood in satanic rituals.  These Catholic papers further claim Jews are in a conspiracy bent on world domination and that Jews, an oppressed minority in Europe for over 1000 years, are actually the rulers of the continent.  Again, as with therules limiting Jewish Freedoms, many of these famous canards became incorporated into modern Anti-Semitic propaganda in the 20th century.<br />Kertzer's work on the relationship between the rise of Catholic political parties in France and Austria and the rise of modern anti-Semitism is nothing short of seminal.  These parties often led and represented in parliaments by priests relied on the worst sort of anti-Jewish vitriol.  Portraying Jews as controllers of finance and the media bent on world domination, they fanned much of what became modern anti-Semitism.  Kertzer even finds several examples of the parties leaders, clergy, and catholic newspapers exposing the racisialist form of anti-Semitism, that Jews even if converted to Christianity are by nature evil and not to be trusted.  Beginning with these sorts of arguments could the Nazi?s eliminationist anti-Semitism be far behind?<br />The weakness of Kertzer's work is in his dealing with the concept of papal infallibility that took firm root in the 19th Century.  Popes Against the Jews is, implicitly, a challenge to the Church's claim of institutional innocence in modern anti-Semitism, laying the blame instead on evil laymen.  While a puzzling position to non-Catholics, the position is in fact internally consistent with Catholic theology.  The rational goes as follows.  Popes and the Church are by definition blameless and innocent, therefore any evil must have been the act of outside forces.  The argument may not be satisfying to many, or even just, but Kertzer would have done well to explain it to his reader so they better understood the Church's position.<br />The tension between the Church and Europe?s Jews is based on 1000 years of the former?s consistent and often violent oppression of the latter.  Obfuscation will not heal these deep rifts.  Honest appraisals, such as this one, however give a strong basis from which one can begin to understand the history and seek ways to address these past wrongs.	2003-02-11

In this way, Dann remains with this work among the great science fiction authors who for whatever vagaries of the market, were never able to &quot;breakout&quot; onto the larger milieu like Harlan Ellison or Neal Stephenson.  That is the loss of readers everywhere.<br />Like a great craftsman, Dann understands that scifi's magic is to use a distant setting and wondrous event to explore very real  challenges we all face in life.  In one story of a judge haunted by a unicorn the author speaks to us emotionally about age and loss of identity.  In another about a rabbi journeying to meet a race of alien Jews the author teaches about the strange symbiosis of Judaism, the larger culture, and anti-Semitism. Vivid characters bring each story to life but at the same time forces the thoughtful reader to become introspective, examining the world right here at home.<br />My greatest hope is that, with this fine collection, Dann will at long last receive the attention of the larger audience that he has for so long deserved.  A wonderfully fun read.	2003-01-18
US	52584172	R2FNNIDRPGLQL8	0380708213	223407615	The Forever War	Books	4	5	6	N	Y	A classic	The Forever War, long a classic of military science fiction, continues to hold great allure despite several decades since its initial release.  The story is straight forward enough.  Mandela, the protagonist, is drafted to go forth to fight an alien race of which he understands almost nothing and questions why he is there in the first place.  Interestingly, as he spends much of his time traveling at near light speed, relativistic effect causes time to pass quicker at home; hundreds of years pass between his missions as he experiences but a few years and each time he returns the entire culture appears made anew.  Much of the work responds to the Vietnam War, facets that may be lost on many younger readers.  However, as many over the years point out, Halderman?s work works very well as a sort of response to Heinlein?s excellent Starship Trooper, asking many similar questions but arriving at very different answers. <br />Like lots of the genre, Forever War teaches us much also about the time in which the author wrote and the challenges he faced.  While often dated, with characters that often seem thin, Halderman?s work will force any thoughtful reader into careful examination.	2003-01-18

The and again, Victor Ostrovsky expects us to take his word for it about the actives of the Mossad.  The best way to judge an authors veracity is look at those things you can prove through other sources.  Looked at through this lens, Ostrovsky's credibility falls like a rock.<br />Time and again he offers outright provable misstatements that can be checked in any library.  The author asserts that most of Israel's Prime Ministers are former generals.  Wrong, only three have been.  He claims that most members of Israel's cabinet are former generals.  Wrong again, and not true of a single government in Israel's history.  Ostrovksy asserts that the Mossad was not useful to the United States in the Cold War.  Strange, since almost every memoir by American intelligence officials state that Israel provided the US with some of the best intelligence received and was the best source of Soviet hardware stolen from the USSR's Arab client states.<br />If what you can check is almost always wrong, how can any reader trust the bulk of this books facts which cannot be checked?

That is a great loss for everyone trying to understand the Arab world, particularly in these times of growing tension and violence.  <br />Ajami asks a profound and much debated question, why did modernity seem to pass the Arab world by?  ?Scholars,? such as Edward Said, argue that everything is the fault of the West and imperialism and that nothing intrinsic in Middle Eastern and Islamic culture deserve the blame.  In contrast, Ajami takes seriously the fact that prior to the enlightenment, Islamic society was both intellectually and materially superior to West.  Indeed, after World War II, with a fair number of Western educated citizens and a burgeoning middle class, many observers say the Middle East having a bright future, likely brighter in fact, than those currently economic and political successes, South Korea, Tiwan, and the other ?asian tigers.?  What then, went wrong?  Ajami points to Arab society never internalizing the nation state and that democratic values never gained currency beyond a small clique of intellectuals.   Instead, such modern political ideas were seen as imperialist impositions, given little more than lip service.<br />I disagree with Ajami on several points, most notably his rosy predictions for Egypt.  Still, the work is well worth a serious read for any student of the Middle East.	2002-12-09

Far from balanced, Said begins as his point of departure that Israel is illegitimate and has no right to exist.  As such, whenever any Palestinian living on the West Bank suggests some form of compromise, Said attacks them viscerally as traitors.  Indeed, Said often seems to be willing to let Palestinians on the West Bank live in misery rather than accepting a compromise that might bring peace to both people.  <br />While Said speaks of his demand for Israel?s destruction through a series of clever code words.  For example, he claims that any peace would require Israel, not the new Palestinian state created by a peace agreement, to absorb 4 million Arabs.  Far from stupid, Said knows that such ideas would destroy the Jewish State, but that, again, is his goal.  Said?s idea of peace involves the death or removal of every Jew from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean.  Readers looking to understand this conflict should look elsewhere.	2002-12-09

Islam?s status as one of the world?s great religions, worthy of study and praise, remains without question.  Nor, should anyone think Islam to be synonymous with terror.  Findley, however, goes even further, by glossing over the murder and violence inflicted by Islamic terror groups, instead describing them as something more akin to the Shriners or Masons.  His discussion of organizations like Hezbollah and Hamas, largely ignores those groups history of kidnapping and murdering Americans or their status on most lists of terror organizations.  Instead, Mr. Findley focuses on their work running soup kitchens and hospitals, all the while neglecting how those works help feed the stream of suicide bombers they unleash on the unwary.<br />Mr. Findley is not a scholar of Islam.  A lackluster ex-congressman, Mr. Findley in an unoriginal stroke, decided to blame his defeat on that ubiquitous target, Jews.  Since leaving public life, he makes his living giving lectures against Israel and as a shill for various authoritarian Arab governments.  For those truly interested in learning about Islam, there are many sources worth reading.  For a good historical overview, I suggest Bernard Lewis.  Other excellent sources are available for studies of religion and theology.  This piece of propaganda, however, is not worth your time.	2002-12-03

Politicians, academics, and those simply interested wait teice a week for his New York Times column to appear. What makes him so special? Friedman's examination of international relations is both lucid and nuanced without ever becoming didactic. Through the course of his career he has built an army of connections throughout the world and isn't afraid to say things how he sees them, no matter how uncomfortable it makes him or his readers. However, there is a deeper reason for his success that is not immediately obvious.<br />Only Friedman's most devoted readers can recognize his real strength - his willingness to adjust, even renounce, strongly held views when circumstances change. With this collection, however, that flexibility and intellectual honest is evident. In a world where people stake out positions and then go in search of the facts. Friedman's candor is refreshing indeed. Moreover, no one will do a better job brining the reader up to speed on the complex world in which we live. For anyone interested, this book is a must.

Sebold delivers a beautiful and sensitive work, weaving an engrossing story in language that is a credit to her craft.  The author gives a remarkable voice to our guide, Susie Salmon (\\"like the fish\\"), never losing her teenagers eye view of the terrifying grief her murder has unleashed on her family and friends.  Most impressively, the book never falls into any of the hackneyed clichés that frequently give the author an easy out.  Instead, she always take the tougher road, giving the story a gritty reality that holds the reader in an emotional bear hug.  We want happy endings and easy answers.  Sebold is wise enough to know this would destroy the reality she seeks to create, brining saccharine to her very real feeling world.  <br />As with her memoir, Lucky, Sebold also brings humor where an outside might not feel it belongs.  But as any survivor of random tragedy will tell you, humor often creeps up in the most unlikely of places.<br />What more is there to say?  If you read one book this year, Lovely Bones should be at the top of your list.  I relished it.	2002-07-29

In a work masquerading as scholarship, Hoffman attempts to delegitimize Judaism, claiming it to be a \\"man made religion.\\"  To achieve this goal he offers what he purports to be quotes from the Talmud (Jewish Legal Code) and the Kabablah (Jewish Mysticism) claiming that they are unavailable and acting as though he penetrated some ancient conspiracy.  Here, however, lies the catch.  All of these texts are widely available in translation, as a simple search of Amazon will show.  Moreover, anyone who looks at these translations will see that Hoffman, misquotes, mistranslates, and occasionally simply makes up the passages he cites in order to discredit Judaism.  Moreover, several of Hoffman's claims are ludicrous to anyone with even a passing familiarity with Judaism.<br />Hoffman claims that modern Jews neither read nor revere the Hebrew Bible (old testament).  Nothing could be further from the truth.  Indeed, religious Jews gather weekly to hear the bible read aloud as part of their liturgy and complete the entire cycle of the text each and every year.  Far from Hoffman's strange assertions, the Hebrew Bible, or Torah, stands at the center of Jewish learning and community. <br />Hoffman states his goal plainly, he wishes to delegitimize the Jewish faith in order to elevate Christianity.  Rather then seeking to understand or explain Judaism, he is only interested in throwing the worst sort of propaganda and mud at the faith Jesus himself practiced.  His work lumps Jews together and ascribes a litany of old charges to the entire group, from base hatred to conspiracies to undermine Christianity.  Those seeking understanding of Judaism would do well to pass this work by and look elsewhere.  Such a work of hatred has little teach about the faith that originated the notion of loving your neighbor.	2002-07-29
US	52584172	RC940OEEE4Z85	0375406239	679283968	The Popes Against the Jews: The Vatican's Role in the Rise of Modern Anti-Semitism	Books	5	20	34	N	N	A major work of scholarship	While many other reviewers choose to launch polemical attacks on Kertzer's book, I think it likely that most never read it.  Far from their assertion that Kertzer seeks to equate Nazism and Catholicism broadly, the author instead offers a nuanced analysis of the relationship between the Catholic Church's activities particularly in the 19th and early 20th Century and the birth of modern anti-Semitism.  Having been given considerable access to the archives of the Church, he develops, brick by brick, the Church's complicity in the rise of the modern hatred of Jews.  While the book is far too large for a close examination here, several examples of the Church's contribution stand out.<br />Many consider Blood Liable an ancient scar on the Church, but one so old that it bears little attention.  For those unfamiliar, Blood Liable refers to the collection of charges that Jews use the blood of Christian children to make Matzos on Passover in a perversion of the communion wafer.  This evil myth began in Europe in the Middle Ages and was frequently leveled against Jewish Communities before they suffered oppression and murder at the hands of the Christian majority.  Kertzer demonstrates that, far from being an ancient myth, this horrible liable held sway in the Church into the 20th Century.  Documenting Blood Liable allegations at the beginning of the 20th Century in respected Church newspapers, Kertzer then uses the notes and letters of high level Church officials to show how this sick belief was wide spread within the Vatican.  Blood Liable was an instrumental piece of the fabric of modern anti-Semitism.<br />Kertzer goes further to show how the Church spread the idea of an evil international Jewish conspiracy, an idea Catholics did not invent, but spread widely through Western Europe.  Further, Kertzer shows how when important Catholics tried to denounce anti-Semitism within the Church, their co-religionists quickly branded them as dupes or traitors to the international Jewish conspiracy.  Such myths of the power hungry blood drinking Jew went a long way to creating the view of Jews as less then human that eventually enabled Catholics across Europe, from France to Poland to willingly aid in the slaughter of their Jewish neighbors.<br />As Kertzer points out, the Church clings to two shaky pillars to profess their innocence.  The first, that while individual, even high ranking Catholics may commit evil, the Church is, by definition, pure and guiltless.  The theological basis of this argument makes it difficult to counter, but suffice to say, none Catholics have no such beliefs and hold all institutions accountable for the evil committed within their walls and by their leadership.  The second, defense argues that Catholics were a target of fascism and, as victims, cannot hold any responsibility for their evil.  This argument is only partially true.  Yes, Christianity was a target of Nazism, though not of fascism in general (in Italy, France, Romania, other countries under fascist rule no such conflict existed).  However, in several places the Catholic Church worked with Hitler's army, in such things as allowing Catholic chaplains to serve in the Nazi army, even for such morally dubious units as the Waffen SS.  <br />Popes Against the Jews goes a long way towards documenting the largely buried history of Catholic attacks on Jews in the modern era.  While that surely makes many unhappy, it is a crucial step for real healing to begin.	2002-07-17

Unlike many who discount the Bible and pretend to be archeologists, Hoffmeier is honest enough to admit that his specialty, near eastern and language studies gives him a very different and worthwhile perspective.  Hoffemeier begins with several interesting points.<br />1- While a particular school of near eastern specialists reject the Exodus tradition, scholars of ancient Egypt are far quicker to see it as, if not exact history, at least routed in historic events.<BR>2- The arguments against historicity of the Bible are mostly based on arguments from negative evidence rather than counter evidence, a basic logical flaw.<br />Hoffmeier, no religious fundamentalist, does not try to prove that the Exodus happened exactly as the Bible recounts.  Instead, he looks to indirect evidence and secondary sources to show that, if later fiction as some claim, the author or authors had considerable knowledge of a culture and society long vanished, down to details of household structure and proper names.  In the end, the author's goal is to prove that the Exodus is plausible in the historical context of ancient Egypt.  Given that goal, he succeeds admirably.	2002-07-11

A beautiful and well-crafted first novel, White Oleander tells the story of a teenage girl's trip though foster homes after her sociopath poet mother is convicted of murder.  In each home, the young Astrid must adjust to new rules and constraints, all the while being stalked by her seductive and totally amoral mother.  The language is rich and evocative, layered with imagery and emotion that keeps the reader wanting more.  Fitch succeeds where a lesser writer would surely fail, not shying away from Astrid's grief, nor softening her mother's evil.  Though I thought the author went a bit overboard with the similes, some of the images were so powerful as to emotionally knock me on my behind.  Particularly haunting was the metaphor of Astrid as a survivalist.  Over all, a worthwhile piece of work from an author who promises to offer many great future works.	2002-07-11

Sebold's sharp prose, blunt honesty, and rather black sense of humor give the reader that rare feeling of stepping into an author's skin.  Where others would shy away, she offers vivid, often horifying picture so that we can know the brutality she suffered.  Most importantly, I did not get a sense she was rewriting the history of her attack and her reaction, but rather like she was opening up a journal of dark times.  <br />Though at times a hard trip, readers will certainly grow from the experience of reading this work.  I urge those interested to read it.	2002-07-11

At the sametime, he examines varrious narative and descriptive options, discussing the pros and cons of each.

The story moves slowly, almost cautiously, as it examines a mosaic of relationships and on the town's small canvas, examines how evil was able to seize an entire country.<br />Hegi's prose are rich and evocative and her characters, even the smallest of them, is designed to give the reader pause.  Her eye for detail so captivates the reader as to make him or her feel as though they are delivered back to those dark years.  Moreover, the author does not use her story as a cudgel to beat you, but rather takes you through a masterful tapestry that brings the story to life.	2002-01-08

Rather than looking to be offended,  readers should praise her excellent crisp style and rye sense of humor.	2001-12-10

The book deserves the title both for its quality and when it was written.  Graves tells the story of life under Augustus, Tiberius, and Augustus from the prospective of Claudius, who succeeded them to the throne.  Many historians would disagree with Graves portrait of Claudius as an inoffensive, bookish, innocent fellow surrounded by evil and intrigue.  Still, he writes extremely well, constructing characters carefully, and giving a vision of life in ancient Rome.  The text is filled with interesting historic details.  <br />Some find the work dry, but once I got into it, I enjoyed it thoroughly.  If you are interested in historical fiction of Rome, I also recommend The Grass Crown Series, which offers considerably more detail of an earlier period.	2001-11-16

The stories of characters representing Adam, Moses, Jesus, and Mohammad are each told in turn, offering a fascinating portrait of each and their influence on humanity.

Here, in a work that is far too short, he seeks to examine the anti-Semitism that is rampant in the Muslim world and its roots. (Please note, I like Professor Bodansky am aware that Arabs are Semites, however, the term, originating with 19th century racists and in use to the present day, then and now refers only to hatred of Jews).    Bodansky does a fair job of tracing how these European concepts entered the Arab world view, beginning with the famous Damascus blood liable, but does not give the topic the attention it deserves.<br />Some reviewers have argued that Bodansky overstates the pervasiveness of anti-Semitic content in Arabic papers.  Clearly, they are ignorant of the facts.  As Bodansky documents, major mainstream Arab papers such as the semi official press organ of the supposedly moderate Egyptian government (whose editor and chief is hand chosen by the President) has continually reported such stories.  Examples of what can be found in theses papers pages on any given day include:<br />*Jews are responsible for the September 11th attack in order to defame Islam (included in the charge is that no Jews died in the WTC, even though Jewish casualties numbered over 1,000).<br />*Jews engineered AIDS and spread it among Arab youths.<br />*Jews have infected Arab women with a virus that loosens their morals.<br />*Jews kill Arab children for sport and use their blood to make Matzo.<br />*Bill Clinton, George Bush and Colin Powell are all really Jewish.<br />*Jews tricked Saddam into invading Kuwait.<br />*Jews have a secret plan to castrate all Muslim men.<br />The list goes on.  Where Bodansky's work shines is in showing how propagating these lies helps prop up the brutal autocratic regimes of the Arab world.  By creating an all powerful entirely evil foreign enemy, these nations can attempt to excuse their own barbaric and repressive tactics that include some of the world's worst human rights abusers in places like Syria, Saudi Arabia, Iraq and others (all of which always rank worse then Israel on lists of human rights abusers).  The book also includes several excellent examples of anti-Semitic cartoons.<br />Readers should note what this book is and what it is not.  It isn't a comprehensive history of Jewish-Muslim relations.  For that I suggest looking at the work of Bernard Lewis.  For what it is, however, it is a worthwhile read.	2001-11-07

The Samuel text is filled with hints, just bellow the surface, indicating  that the author is effectively an apologist for David's sins.  Indeed, several times, the reader gets the feeling that the text &quot;doth protest too much.&quot;  Unfortunately, Edghill ultimately fails in this goal.  <br />The first third of the book, is both novel and interesting, in particular the idea of telling it from the perspective of King Saul's daughter.  However, as she integrates the David character into the text, the reader realizes that, rather than creating a fuller image of the character exposing his flaws, she has gone too far in the other direction.  Far from a complex and flawed character, in Queenmaker, David is little more than an egocentric power hungry monster.  <br />Had the author shown a willingness to make the character even the least bit likeable, or seek to explain his motivations beyond a rather shallow greed, the book would have been a far better read.  While reasonably well written, the poorly developed characters fail to carry the book.  If you are interested in such texts, however, I highly recommend Rizpah by Charles Israel, a more interesting and nuanced novel.  Though out of print, many copies are available.	2001-11-05

Zeider tells the story powerfully, with humor, grief and a rye attention to detail, all in appropriate measure.  <br />Reading Layover, it comes as no surprise that the author is also an accomplished poet.  Her tight prose carries the story beautifully.  Where other authors might ruin the story by making it saccharine sweet, she is able to keep it going with powerful imagery and a great mastery of the language.  As a reader, we cry for her character?s suffering, laugh at her barbed observations, and feel her sense of dread confusion.  <br />A last personal note.  As a reader, I found this novel so evocative that I often considered putting down.  The ability to bring forth so many emotions marks this as a worthwhile novel.  I highly recommend it.	2001-10-29

As such, it is essential and invaluable to any serious student.<br />This collection utility is immeasurable.  Not only does it contain all of the works collected under one cover, it also gives strong commentary and a well-written introduction.  The translator has significantly updated the work, eliminating archaic English translation often held over from earlier editions and giving useful reference for things like Biblical parallels.<br />My only complaint about the work is that the text is extremely dense and the font quite small.

Not only does this book reflect his skills as an exceptional researcher, but also his gifted mitchner-like prose.  Thus, he not only presents the life of America's greatest presidents in exhaustive detail, but also does a commendable job of placing him in his context.  McCullough gives us a wonderful history of the Truman family and explains how his particular milieu affected his particular sensibilities.<br />Many readers are put off by this books extraordinary length.  They should not be.  To McCullough's credit, his work rarely drags, nor does he go into irrelevant detail.  Unlike many political biographies, Truman's pre-political life must be covered in great depth, as he came to politics very late in life.  Moreover, the author is well aware that most readers know little about Truman's service in the US Senate.<br />What makes this work particularly extraordinary is the way the author &quot;connects the dots&quot; explaining how Truman's life before the presidency effected the decisions he made in the office.  Nor does McCullough pull his punches, but like a good biographer is open to criticizing his subject.  He gives Truman's strengths and his failings equal consideration and attention.<br />With sweeping plots and larger than life characters, this book reads like a novel.  That is a big part of the reason that it makes such great history.	2001-10-23

So, without betraying anything, I can tell you that the novel is loosely about a real magician, Carter the Great, whose performance President Harding attended the day he died.

Rarely.  However, Scholem's work on Sabbatai Sevi is exactly that.    So important is this text, that all other examinations before have fallen away and are no longer studied and almost all that came after are derivative.  A brilliant scholar, the author goes to great depths, examining both the historical and philosophical underpinnings of Judaism's largest Messianic movement since Jesus.<br />The author rejects the traditional explanation that followers of Sevi were attracted to him because of the deprivation experienced by some Jews of the period.  As Scholem points out, even wealthy communities of Jews in Amsterdam and Greece found him irresistible.  Patterns of the growth of the movement are given great attention and are fascinating.<br />Many people are put off by the length of this work (almost 1000 pages of prose).  However, the field is so vast, that a shorter book would not have done it justice.  While somewhat esoteric, Sabbati Sevi provides a powerful window into a period of Jewish history given too little study.	2001-10-17

Like many politicians, Netanyahu's tendency to over simplify complex issues into pithy quotes is occassionally irksome, but he gets his point across.  In particular, Netanyahu makes good use of his experience in America to clarify many mistaken notions that some Americans hold on the Middle East.<br />At a basic level, Netanyahu understands how little Americans understand about the crucial georgraphy of the region.  For example, most Americans do not appreciate that Israel, a tiny country is smaller than the state of New Jersey.  Nor do they appreciate that Israel's territory represnets less than .004% of the total area of the Middle East.<br />Where Netanyahu really shines, is in his clear prose.  Time and again he gives details that few people know.  For example, why is it that nations like Syria, Libya, and Iran, some of the worlds worst human rights abusers can sit on the UN security council but Israel is the only nation excluded?  Why does the EU bend over backwards to make nice to Arab dictators, refusing to speak ill of them, while heaping critisizm on the Middle East's only tiny democracy?  You may not agree with his conclusions, but these are issues deserving of consideration.<br />Where this book falls down is that it does not present you with the opinions held by both sides, of course to its credit, it does not claim to.  Netanyahu never pretends to be unbiased, unlike much of the anti-Israel propaganda one can read.  If you want a deep understanding of the complexity of the Middle East, this book alone will not do it.  However, it will give you an understanding of a crucial perspective that many people share.	2001-10-16

In a struggle so personal, objectivity is always the first victim.  The author is clearly pro-Israel, but that does not detract from the value of the text.  Indeed, his willingness to actually admit his perspective is, in my opinion laudatory.  Too many other &quot;scholars&quot; in this field present their opinion as if no other was legitimate.<br />The text covers the basic facts of the Arab Israeli conflict in a highly readable manner.  Subjects like the religious histories of the parties, the basic outlines of the battles, as well as the points of disagreement are given good coverage.   ... Despite the complaints, this is factually correct, supported by serious historians and military analysts around the world.  Others disagree with his assessment about the origins of the Arab refugee problem, a subject that remains unsettled by historians and still engenders heated debate.<br />This book is not exhaustive.  No single book could be.  If you are interested in further reading on the subject, which is essential if you want to really educate yourself, I suggest that you also read the writings of Bernard Lewis, the dean of Middle East Scholars, The History of the Arab Israeli Wars by Chaim Herzog, a military history of the conflict used as a reference by both sides, and The Crusade Through Arab Eyes, an excellent book on the origin of Muslim views of the West.  <br />... As I said, no work is exhaustive, but this book is a reasonably good place to start.	2001-10-12

Espositio gathered a large number of scholars, each to produce a different chapter covering issues like math, philosophy, politics, etc.  While no single volume could cover so vast a subject, the reader is left with what is almost certainly the best introduction to Islam.  <br />While many people, unfortunately, have bought Karen Armstrong's Short History of Islam, this text is far superior in almost every way.  Not only is it more thorough and better written, it also deals with Islam from within as well as from without.  Islamic culture is examined not from the perspective of an outsider with rose colored glasses, but from several distinguished and Muslim and non-Muslim scholars with a firm background in the subject.<br />There is not doubt that no single volume could do all of Islamic history justice.  However, this book with its rich photographs and strong prose, is probably as good an introduction as you could get under a single cover.	2001-10-10

Books	5	21	22	N	N	Wonderful telling of a powerful story	Collins and Lapierre make an important and much needed contribution to a field often beset by propaganda masquerading as scholarship.  In the place of such works of half-truth, these authors offer a crisply written and carefully researched history of Jerusalem, the eternal city.  Instead of taking sides, as is so often the tendency when dealing with this subject, Collins and Lapierre give considerable attention and equal weight to all sides.  The authors interviewed literally thousands of people in order to understand people's emotional attachment to this often fought for city.  Using this research they then tell the epic tale of the modern quest to control it.  <br />The book is both informative and riveting.  Putting the facts before bias, they tell a story that needs to be told.  I cannot recommend it enough.	2001-10-09
US	52584172	R23YWJSP2MGN65	0394402847	448449704	The Thirteenth Tribe	Books	1	46	97	N	N	Out of date and disproven by new evidence	The culture of the Khazars, a central asian tribe that adopted Judaism over 1000 years ago and was then destroyed by Gengis Khan, is a facinating subject worthy of study. Sadly, it always gets mixed up with an old 19th century idea that modern European Jews are decended from the Khazars and not the biblical Jews. That theory, highly popular in the middle 19th century served the duel use of, for some, proving that the Jews around Europe were not the same as those of the Hebrew Bible, giving great comfort to anti-semitic Christians. For others, they wanted to prove that Jesus was not Jewish, a strange branch of racist psudo-theory that goes on even today.<br />In the 19th century Jews could simply role their eyes but had no evidence to disprove the theory. The best evidence against the Khazar theory was lingustic, as neither Hebrew nor Yiddish seems to contain any trace of a cetral asian language.  Now, with gentic evidence, we can positively identify common ancestry of Jews from areas as far flung as Germany, Spain, Yemen, and Russia. Identical Y chromosome markers can be found among members of every community. While it may be that some Khazars married into the larger Jewish community, the evidence indicates that it never happened in overwhelming number. Indeed, their is considerable historic evidence that the Khazar were largely cut off from the rest of the Jewish world.<br />Many reviwers point to the idea that many European Jews show non-middle eastern features (blue eyes, blond hair, etc.)  However, the existance of large scale conversion to Judaism is a clear historical fact.  Particularly before Christianity became firmly rooted in Eastern and South Eastern Europe, many locals converted to Judaism.  Many of the modern Jewish attitudes against conversion are in fact reasonably recent, tracable to the strong and often violent action Christians took against communities where individuals chose to become Jews.  <br />Given the vast amount of genetic evidence againstthe theory one has to wonder why it still gets so much play.  After all, if all Jews contain common genetic markers from locations across the world, what possible evidence could be for this strange theory?	2001-10-04

Given that people should know the thought process of many of those who serve in government, this book is well worth reading. Specter seems to see himself as the great diviner of justice, rather than a bit of a hack who plays independent but seems to always buckle to the right wing of his party. Particularly shocking is that he does not seem to understand what he has done wrong, instead insisting on rather strange defenses.<br />I will not go into his continued insistence in the so-called &quot;magic bullet&quot; theory. I for one do not support the Oliver Stone fantasy of events, but whatever your predilection, no bullet does what that bullet did. Indeed, Specter still fails to discuss the fact that no one seems to be able to recreate that famous bullet's trajectory of multiple wounds creating right turns.<br />Where I think Specter should be really ashamed is his half apology that he did not understand how he and his colleagues shredding of Anita Hill looked or that he did not understand how women felt about sexual harassment. Left undiscussed is the evidence that has come to light indicating that Justice Thomas, in collusion with the first Bush administration, conspired to hide evidence that lends a great deal of credibility to Hill's charges. Specter just doesn't want to talk about it, less he tarnish his self image as the man of great principal.<br />People should know how many politicians have warped views of reality. For that reason this is a good read. Just take it with a grain of salt.	2001-10-04

My own favorite was &quot;An Incident at West Point&quot; though several books about the famed Tuskegee Airmen have also received wide praise.  What has been given less attention is the history of anti-Semitism in the US Army. With this work, Joseph Bendersky, a noted history professor, ends that glaring omission.<br />Bendersky documents several layers of anti-Semitism in the US army, through most of the 20th century.  In the early part of the century, it was reflected in opposition to immigration based on the belief that Jews represented a &quot;bad and unchristian&quot; element.  Moving forward, the author exposes the army subscribing to such infamous anti-Semitic canards as the &quot;Protocols of the Elders of Zion&quot; that argues for a world wide Jewish conspiracy whose goal is the destruction of Christianity.  <br />These beliefs had great impact on American policy.  A great example being General Marshall's opposition to the State of Israel, when he served in Truman's cabinet.<br />Many, myself included, will find the subject of this book disquieting.  That is all the more reason that we are fortunate that an excellent scholar with meticulous attention to research and citations wrote this very fine work.  It is an excellent source for those interested in the history of the Jews in America.	2001-10-04
US	52584172	R1J2HQ322B6L1B	0394720245	800538326	The Power Broker: Robert Moses and the Fall of New York	Books	4	24	35	N	N	Important but flawed book	One cannot over state Robert Moses' impact on New York's very landscape.  Nor is it possible to underestimate his almost rapacious ability to amass political power, his skill at manipulating the political system, nor the degree to which he was able to out maneuver and bully elected officials to his will.  As someone who has spent ten years making a living in politics there can be no doubt that Moses was the maestro of politics with an unmatched ability to call the tune.  For this reason, this is a must read for those interested in politics.<br />That said, Caro goes too far in attacking Moses on a broad front, often on charges that are spurious.  At the same time, he does not sufficiently acknowledge the contributions Moses made to the City and the Nation.  This book follows a problematic habit of Caro of needing to paint his subjects in a purely negative light, attacking them viciously and always underestimating their positive contributions.<br />On the unfair attacks, Caro charges Moses with ruining NYC riverfront by running highways along them.  While that is true as a matter of fact, he fails to explain that, at the time, driving was seen as recreation and every American city followed the identical path.  On another score, Caro criticizes Moses because his highways generated traffic thus requiring the creation of more highways.  Again the charge is unfair.  Traffic studies were at best primitive and the effects of traffic multiplication were little understood.<br />At the same time, Caro fails to appreciate the sheer scope of Moses vision and the works he built.  Nor, while he attacks Mosses' manipulation of the process, does he ever deal with the really tough question of whether another way to build great public works exist other than with a man like Moses.<br />For all that, Caro's book is still an essential read for those interested in the art of politics and power as well as urban planning.  While the book is long, occasionally over written, and shares withCaro?s other works a rather unfortunate tendency towards melodrama.  it still offers the reader much that they cannot learn elsewhere.  Moses was an artist who used America?s greatest city as his canvas.  Sadly, his masterpiece showed signs of early wear and mistakes by the artist.	2001-10-01
US	52584172	R3A9AZ1UFOCSG8	0385413726	244095611	From Beirut to Jerusalem	Books	4	211	264	N	N	Must be understood in its context	While I consider this book well worth reading, a word must be said about the context in which it was written.  During the early 90's and late 80's a consensus was growing that the only way to end the Israeli Palestinian conflict was for Israel to recognize Yasser Arafat as the dejure government of the Palestinians.  Moving down such a path meant that Arafat would have to under go considerable rehabilitation.  One of the subtexts of Friedman's book is that very effort.  The result is that Friedman intentionally glosses over the murder, mayhem and destruction Arafat spread through Lebanon.  Little attention is paid to the civilians they murdered, the politicians they extorted, or the destabilizing influence that the PLO's &quot;State-within-a-state&quot; created.<br />Occasionally Friedman is unfair in his assesment of Israel's actions.  In particular failing to discuss the PLO's cross boarder raids into Northern Israel that left scores of civilian causalities and how it motivated Israeli public opinion is left insufficiently discussed.  Probably that is due to Friedaman's desire to indict Israel's Likud government which he saw as hostile to his belief in the need to create a PLO-Israel dialogue.<br />What makes the book interesting is in the story of how a state sandwiched between two regional powers was unable to survive.  Interestingly, that is partially because Beirut tried to play both sides. That puts it in contrast to Jordan, a similarly situated state that, after the '67 War, through its lot entirely with Israel and has prospered under its protection.<br />A little should be added about Friedman's idea of a direct PLO-Israel dialogue.  Within a few years of this book Israel had in fact followed the course he recommended, recognizing the PLO and the rights of the Palestinians to have a state of there own.   Friedman always thought that painful compromise by Israel would engender a Palestinian willingness to make similar compromises, like letting Israel annex the 4% of the West Bank which were majority Israeli, share Jerusalem, and accept demilitarization as well as a shared Jerusalem as long as the deal came with buckets of foreign aid.  10 years after this book was written, Israel's Prime Minister Barak offered exactly that deal as Friedman envisioned it and he like the rest of the world was shocked when Arafat rejected it, deciding instead on a course of violence.<br />Despite the fact that this book is quite dated, it is still a good read.  Those interested in the topic might also want to look at the work of Bernard Lewis, Chaim Herzog's &quot;The Arab Israeli Wars&quot; and Itimar Rabinovitch's work on the Lebanese conflict.	2001-09-30

The authors thesis, that Rome never truly fell but evolved into the catholic church/feudal state is well defended with ample evidence.<br />What makes this book so extraordinary is the depth and breath of the subject matter covered.  Military history, politics, technology, art, science, social development, trade, are all given ample coverage.  While it can be quite dry, the reader is free to skip around reading only the subjects of interest.  For the scholar or the curious, this is a must own text that will serve as a crucial guide and reference.	2001-09-29

That the character and concept of the divine as presented in the text evolves considerably is beyond debate.   That which Abraham experiences on Mount Morriah stands in rather stark contrast with what the Nation of Israel sees and feels at Sinai.<br />The effort, however, ultimately fails, because the author projects to many of his own peculiar opinions onto the story, though little textual evidence exists to support them.  The most striking example is his claim to a divine effort to control male sexuality and procreation.  His evidence for this is scant and often requires considerable bending of the text.  Still, his effort is worthwhile, and worthy of a successor who takes the text a bit more seriously.  Good literary biography requires the discipline to stay with the text, less it veer into the realm of fiction.<br />If you find this interesting, I highly recommend James Kugel's The Bible as it Was.	2001-09-29

Bernard Lewis may well be the greatest living scholar of Arab and Muslim culture. His understanding and respect for the people and history in the region makes it possible for him to strike a rare balance between those who believe Arab culture can do no wrong and those who believe it can do no right.<br />Lewis' original work was based on the thesis that the Middle East had not come to terms with the West, culturally or politically.  When he wrote this updated work in 1994, after the fall of the Soviet Union, considerable reason for hope existed that pervasive globalization would integrate the Middle East into the rest of the world.<br />Sadly, he may have written too early.  Recent event indicate that the traditional Islamic hostility to the west are striking back with a vengeance.  Moreover, it is unclear whether any of the modernizing nation states in the region have the legitimacy with their own people to survive the coming assault.<br />While events have made this work somewhat dated, it is still offers essential perspective to understanding Islam, the Arab world, and the possible future.  For those with a serious interest, it is a must read.	2001-09-28

Even almost three decades after his death, there are no shortage of people who see LBJ as the ultimate villan of American politics.  Many people of this camp dislike Dallek's work, because he puts his subject in his context.<br />While Dallek does not excuse the sort of election fraud in which LBJ engaged, he does explain that it was wide spread.  Some find this an unacceptable defense, but one should note that the sorts of tricks he describes have been wide spread in the US for most of the 19th and early 20th century. To dismiss LBJ for engaging in such activities who require similar condemnation of every US president from Adams to FDR.  <br />Dallek in fact, is unflinching in discussing LBJ's negative side.  His pension for strong arming opponents, his abuse of his staff, his womanizing and drinking, and his dirty tricks are all layed bare.  At the same time, Dallek reviews how crucial LBJ was as part of the New Deal and his brave role as a champion of civil rights.<br />The other major LBJ biography by Caro is far less balanced in its approach to this complex and ultimately tragic figure.  For a truly great and complete biography of LBJ, I suggest that you read this one.	2001-09-26

Indeed, when I recommend it to friends I find myself stammering.  Trying to answer the inevitable question &quot;what is it about?&quot; looses the beauty of what I consider one of the great works of modern fiction.  Chabon paints an extraordinary picture with words.  His mastery of the English language is so intense that I often found myself reading the same sentence over and over again, not because I couldn't understand him, but just to savor his prose.<br />Chabon's characters compliment his superb style.  Their complex personalities and idiosyncrasies grip the reader pulling him or her onward to the next page.  All the while, the author asks us deep philosophical questions wrapped in beautiful imagery.  From the two main characters, one an escape artist struggling to break free, while his friend desperately tries to stay bound, to the lonely man stuck in a desolate waste, all the images bring the authors message about identity and self definition home for the reader.<br />I love to read and I must say, if you are going to read one work of fiction, read this one.	2001-09-25

The problem was that, when she actually began doing her research, she found that most of the common beliefs about the long history of that population are just inaccurate.  In fact, she found that the majority of the current population descended from waves of migration beginning in the 19th century and peaking in the early 20th.      Peter's uses considerable primary source data, including the ottoman and British censuses and the travel journals of western visitors like Mark Twain, all of which prove that the area compromising modern day Israel and the West Bank were largely unpopulated in the 19th century and experienced waves of immigration from people looking for work.  Even more controversial, she documents the existence of ancient Jewish communities on both sides of the Jordan River, in places like Jerusalem, Gaza, Hebron, Safed, Nablus, and others.  Sadly, many of these communities were forced to flee Arab violence at the turn of the century.  Thus Hebron, which has boasted a continual Jewish community for over 2,500 years, had no community between 1930-67 because the Jews had to flee for their lives.  Yes, tPeters' book contains substantial flaws, particularly in her use of statistics in what can be called a \\"number's game\\" (the quote from the often maligned Daniel Pipes who demonstrates the greater intellectual honesty of pro-Israel intellectuals in his dissection and dismissal of Peters' work, a thing sadly seemingly always lacking from the Israel haters).    Nonetheless, the central thesis is well worth considering.     Arieh Avneri's Claim of Dispossession: Jewish Land Settlement and the Arabs 1878-1948 adds considerable documentary evidence to this thesis and is also worth examination. Readers would also do well to review the works of the fine historian Benny Morris.	2001-09-25

Other works have followed the same course, arguing that sephardic Jews (those of Arab/Spanish origin) come from other places entirely.  Several major holes in his argument render is unworkable.<br />Firstly, most of his evidence is linguistic, based an argument that Yiddish has Slavic roots.  Now ignoring for the moment that such arguments might extend to saying that African-Americans come from England because they speak English, the thesis is flawed for other reasons.  Yiddish was spoken throughout central, eastern, and southern Europe and includes words and idiom from a range of languages across this region.<br />That said, the crucial proof that Wexler theory is false is genetic rather than linguistic.  The Y chromosome of Jews (which passes from son to son, altered only through mutation) has similar markers that are found on Jews from every region.  In other words, Jews from France, Poland, Yemen, Iraq, and India, all show clear indication of common ancestry.  Moreover, certain genetic diseases seem to be common among the various groups.  If as Wexler argues, the decedents of native European people's who adopted Jewish religion and custom made up the majority of modern Jews, than they would be genetically distinct from the rest of world Jewry.  Given that they are not, Wexler's argument does not hold water.	2001-09-24

The authors focus, not simply on the places, dates, and statistics, but on the motivations and personalities of the central characters.  <br />While I read this book several months ago, recently I found myself rereading it.  It serves as a wonderful reminder of the trials, difficulties, and cost in blood and treasure to those who have sought to hold sway over central Asia.  While many people have at least a passing familiarity with Russia's failure to conquer Afghanistan in the 20th Century, few understand the rivers  of Russian and British blood that were spilled in previous adventures in past centuries.<br />More than such military warnings, the authors also do an excellent job teaching the reader about the conflicting cultures of east and west.  The disasters that result from misunderstandings of language and custom are presented in a riveting fashion.  While the text is almost entirely about the 19th century, many familiar forces are at work.  Multinational corporations, jingoistic nationalists, spies, glory-seeking officers, popular national pride, all play a part in this unfolding story.<br />I would offer one caveat in my praise of this work.  The text lacks maps, which would have greatly increased my enjoymnet.  In the end, I just read it with an atlas always in reach.  It made it easier and more enjoyable.  Despite this strange flaw, I highly recommend this work.

Path to Power is no exception this unfortunate trend. <br />Lyndon Johnson is a complex, tragic, and deeply flawed character worthy of a nuanced study.

Indeed, it is one of the great stories of our collective history. That said this book falls down on several scores. Firstly, it is a bit like those &quot;guide to Europe&quot; books. Her attempt to cover 4,000 years of history spread over three religions and three continents in less than 500 pages insures that you can learn a few facts about a lot of things, but gain an understanding of none.<br />Secondly, the book is a bit like a travel book written by someone who has only visited a few of the places described. Armstrong lacks the background to discuss her subject, nor has she done the research to compensate. Not only does she give short shrift and rather odd descriptions of Judaism and Christianity, she is less than helpful on Islam. <br />That brings us to the third problem: Armstrong's goal is not to give the reader a true picture of Islam, one of the world's most beautiful faiths, but rather to sanitize it beyond recognition. Like a Visigoth, she sellects those few things that, as a liberal westerner she finds appealing, and leaves the rest on the trash heap. By the time she is done describing it, we are left with a religion that few Muslims would recognize at their own.<br />My greatest problem is that what Armstrong does is tell us a lot more about herself and her own feelings than about the real people who practice these faiths. Her rather self centered first person style may have rocketed this book to the top of the charts, but does little to inform the reader of anything other than what is going on in the mind of a middle aged ex-nun.  First person is a fine introduction to a subject, but over 400 pages of it is a bit extreme.<br />If you are truly interested in understanding Islam, I would suggest you look at the &quot;Oxford History of Islam&quot; or &quot;A History of Islamic Societies.&quot; You may also want to look at Bernard Lewis's &quot;History of the Middle East&quot; or &quot;The Crusade through Arab Eyes.&quot;	2001-09-22

Massie's Dreadnought is a rare gem, a non-fiction page-turner that seems to capture the imagination of most readers.  Massie examines the arms race, not the nuclear one between Russia and the US, but the battleship race between Britain and an emergent Germany.  In clear engaging prose he explains why these enormous ships were so important and how they were seen as more than weapons but as symbols of national prestige.<br />Nor does the author simply focus on these great ships.  Most of the book is devoted to the characters who took part in the events and how they shaped them.  At the same time, he never looses sight of the irony of the rush to invest huge sums to build these huge ships, even though each generation would be quickly rendered obsolete.  The book also forces us to look at many of the foibles of our own time and see that they are far from unique.  The struggle between the modernizes of Britain at the turn of the century locked in battle with an entrenched bureaucracy rings more than a little familiar.<br />To his credit, he also makes sure we understand how all of this nationalist competition would end with the blood of the young men of Europe watering the fields of Belgium and France. The lessons this moment in history teaches are ones we could all use today.<br />In short, I could not put this book down.  If you are planning a trip and have time, or if you travel in many short hops (conveniently none of the chapters are too long) you will find this a wonderful entertaining read.	2001-09-21

Kertzer, a historian who was granted considerable access to the Vatican, examines how the church failed to condemn the rise of anti-Semitism in Europe and actually added to it.  <br />Among other things he cites the leading roles a number of priests  played in propagandizing for anti-Semitic groups, including spreading the infamous Protocols of the Elders of Zion far and wide.  Moreover, he shows that the church actively supported a number of virulently anti Semitic political parties in the late 19th and early 20th century.  The ideology of these parties was, in many ways, a breeding ground for the philosophy of national socialism.Kertzer cites several examples of church officials seeing Jews as evil and enemies of the faith.<br />No doubt many reviewers of this book will condemn it, I suspect most without ever reading it.  That is unfortunate.  This does nothing to help break with the past, nor does it contribute to honest scholarship.  People should read this fine work by a talented historian before they tried to condemn it.  If they find fault in his arguments they should cite them before they resort to polemics	2001-09-19

While I enjoyed both in their own right, they are so different that going from one to the other adds nothing to either.<br />While the movie's most notable qualities are a breath of story and an epic scope, the book is beautiful for its economy of words and distant style.  Written in the third person, as opposed to the film's heavy handed first person, the perspective is all knowing, yet reveals few details.  The author brings the characters to life to some degree, but what is amazing is that they are interesting given their one dimensionality.  The story, short as it is, contains much less of the deep intertwined relations of the movie, but I believe that makes it much improved  over the screen version.<br />While everyone focuses on the title story, the other two that are included are also enjoyable. As a read, each of the stories is quite quick and complete.  If you are taking a trip in several staggered stints, this is a good book to take along and pass the time.	2001-09-16

She has a wonderful sense of the way that culture and food interact and develop.  In addition, she writes beautifully about Jews have effected and been effected by the cultures where they reside, adapting local cuisine to the Jewish palette and dietary rules.<br />The Jewish community in Italy dates back to ancient Rome, at least 2,300 years.  Their cuisine is rich, flavorful, and undeniably Italian.  Goldstein brings their tradition to life in this great cookbook.  Moreover, her introduction and notes that go with the receipts are facinating.<br />While everything I have tried was wonderful, some things should be pointed out in particular.  The pizza (not what you think) is great.  Also, Goldstein teaches that the ubiquitous putenesca sauce is, in fact, of Jewish origin.  The risotto and stews are also wonderful.  As with her other books, Goldstein does not skimp on the desserts!<br />A testament to what a great book this is the fact I am getting hungry just writing about it!	2001-09-13

In many ways, though the style is quite different, it reminds me of Hyperion.  The reason is that both books go back to the basics of what makes great sci-fi.  Both explore the impact of singular inovations on society.  In the case of Diamond Age, it is nanotech.<br />Stephenson asks a profound question. How would society structure itself if it eliminated want?  What if there was no more shortage and social structure needed a basis other than division of scarce resources?  Stephenson answers this question brilliantly, all the while rapping it in an engrossing story with interesting characters.  The book never gets lost in its technology, but instead is firmly rooted in a gripping story that pulls the reader in.<br />In short, this is a wonderful book that I could not put down and is a must for serious sci fi fans.  I am certain you will enjoy it immensely.	2001-09-11

While Rychlak does cite the large amounts of evidence of Jews who, after WWII, were effusive in their praise of the pope, he fails to refute some of the most powerful indictments against the Church's behavior during the war.<br /><br />While one could discount the praise for Pious that Jews gave as an effort to curry favor with the long serving pope during the creation of the State of Israel, I will take it as face value as thanks for those Jews that the church saved.  However, that fails to deal with Cornwall's most devastating charges such as:<br /><br />1- Pious support for the concordant with Hitler and his willingness to disband Germany's catholic party, the most powerful bulwark against Nazism that existed at the time of its dissolution.<br /><br />2- The church's willingness to allow priests to serve as chaplains in even the most blood thirst of Nazi military  units such as the SS.<br /><br />3- The church's failure, even now, to excommunicate Hitler, a baptized catholic.<br /><br />4- The Pope's failure to condemn the activities of catholic eastern and south eastern regimes that supported the genocide against the Jews.<br /><br />Certainly, one can understand the Pope in the context of a man who believed that Communism was the greater threat to his church than fascism.  However, one might also say that such thoughts belong in the realm of politics, and that it is the responsibility of the righteous to attack evil, wherever they find it.<br /><br />The world still waits for a balance biography of this fascinating and conflicted individual.  Neither this, nor Cornwall's book meets that bill.	2001-09-10

Her book on Jewish Italian cooking should be read by anyone who likes to read cook books.  <br />In this book, Goldstein explores Sephardic food, the culinary heritage of Jews of the Middle East.  She does not disapoint.  The recipes are easy to follow and very tasty.  The presentation is excellent and will make your mouth water.  What is wonderful about all of Goldstein's work is you can see how Jews have, for centuries, absorbed the recipes of the culture in which they live, adapting them for their own tastes and dietery requirements.  My wife and I have had a wonderful time cooking out of this book.  The only problem is deciding what to make first.<br />A great work.	2001-09-10

While it is often featured in cookbook sections, that is a tiny part of what makes it great.  Indeed, as a cookbook it is strange, because like most pre-columbian european cuisine, the food does not seem very apetizing.  What is wonderful is that the book is a great social history, telling how crypto Jews who remained in Spain after the inquisition were often caught because of foods that they ate and when they ate them.  One can imagine the inquisition puzzling over recipes to identify some as &quot;jewish&quot; and therefore suspect.<br />The stories that the author gives along with the recipes are extremely moving and tell the tale of a people struggling to hold onto their identity in the face of adversity.  While you may not want to eat the food, it will certainly want to make you cry.	2001-09-10

The attempt to turn biblical hebrew into old english in an effort to make it more formal is an old tradition, and takes much away from the work.  On that score, Everett Fox's &quot;Give Us a King&quot; offers a far more readable and interesting translation.  Alter's work is also superior for its explination of ambiguity in language where they occur.  So why four Stars?<br />The Anchor is a must own work for its excellent maps and quite good commentary.  The translator also breaks the work down into interesting units of drama that give an interesting perspective.  If you just want to read Samuel to get the flavor of the work, read Fox instead.  However, if you are studying it, this work, for all its flaws, is a must own.	2001-09-10

(Anchor Bible Reference Library)	Books	4	18	21	N	N	An excellent overview and introduction	Mazar's work is noteworthy for its breath rather than its depth.  Mazar reviews a huge period of history, breaking it down into several eras and further dividing the analysis based on several categories.  In each subject Mazar examines the relevant material and the prevalent theories that surround it.  While the author's point of view on many of these theories is made clear in the book itself, enough information is given so that any reader can go off to research these questions for themselves.  <br />Some have attacked Mazar on political grounds.  Such charges are baseless and made by those with axes to grind who are more interested in their particular points of view rather than what we can learn from the archaeological record.<br />While it is true that any of Mazar's subtopics of a particular period could be a book in itself, none are given short shrift.  Enough detail is given to give the reader a basic understanding.  What makes the book exceptional is how these pieces fit together, giving the reader an understanding of the broader whole.  If you are interested in this subject, Mazar is an excellent place to start.	2001-09-05

Court, a consumer advocate and recognized expert on healthcare issues, here examines and critiques the strengths and weaknesses of the prevalent American healthcare system.  Particularly interesting is his analysis of the motivations of HMO management and the ways they seek the profit motive.  Court methodically details why the system's priority is not maximizing the patient's health, but controlling cost by limiting the use of resources.<br />Court and Smith do not forget the human face of those injured by this industry and bring them to life with a number of moving anecdotes.  These tragic cases, however, are not what is at the heart of this important book.  These anecdotes serve well because they are clearly not breakdowns in the system but rather it accomplishing its goal of increasing profit at any &quot;cost.&quot;	2001-09-05

In the US, every time a monstrous crime is committed, dime store novelists and yellow journalists rush to write moralistic works condemning the accused. These works are about as deep as Jerry Springer, with an equal level of introspection.<br />Carrere, however, takes an entirely different tack as he explores the inner life of a prosperous and respected doctor at the world health organization who murdered his wife, children and parents, and then tried to kill himself. Investigators quickly learned that the man did not work at the WHO and was not a doctor. In fact, he had been lying to his friends and family for almost two decades, pretending to go to work, when in fact he would spend his days walking in the woods. On the verge of being caught, he committed this monstrous crime.<br />Simply condemning the murderer would have created a rather banal book. Carrere goes much deeper, exploring the man's inner life, seeking out his motivations, and at times growing quite sympathetic for the man, while never excusing him. As the reader, we also grow to know him and feel for him, all the while knowing what he did and feeling sickened for our sympathy.<br />While a short book, I found it emotionally wrenching and often troubling. I suppose that is what makes it art.	2001-08-29

In many ways, it laid out the blue print for a two state solution and the advantages for both Israel and the Palestinians. His vision eventually for the most part became the course that Israel followed it its efforts to give the Palestinians a state, which the Palestinians in turn rejected at Camp David in 2000. While the current conflict may well render this work out of date, it still give an excellent view of what might have been and where Israel was willing to go.

While many describe this text as the most important work of western civilization, too many people find it both impenetrable and poorly written.  That is not the fault of the actual text; indeed the Hebrew poetry of the bible is among some of the best ever written. The problem lies instead in the translation.  Myriad efforts at popular translations have been made, from putting the bible into common English to straight line-by-line English.  While these methods render the text more easily read, they also cost it the poetic language and much of its drama.<br />Everett Fox has solved these problems with a translation that is nothing short of masterful.  The language is lucid, the prose poetic, and the story intact.  Moreover, Fox is an honest translator, detailing his decisions and pointing out where multiple meaning exist.  I have read literally dozens of translations of the bible.  In my opinion, this is far and away the best.<br />Fox's contribution to the text will surely be remember and appreciated both now and for decades to come.	2001-08-23

While he fails to mention that fact, I believe it is crucial to the context of the work.  Anywhere else in the Middle East, any citizen who wrote such a critical work would be quickly jailed or worse.<br /><br />My problem with Ezrahi's book is that, though well written, he fails to deal with the complex issues of conflict within the Israeli national consciousness.  Israel, as state that has spent its entire history under constant siege by its neighbors, struggles with the twin Herculean tasks of building a pluralistic democratic society, while at the same time defending their borders from a sea of nations bent on their destruction.  This dichotomy has caused great stress in Israeli culture and that stress is worthy of academic attention.<br /><br />Rather than recognizing this conflict and the toll it takes on the Israeli soul, Ezrahi takes the easy route, simply cataloging and bemoaning the things Israel is forced to do to defend itself.  That is an unfortunate tack to take, since it leaves little room for discussion, but instead amounts to little more than a litany of \\"sins.\\"<br /><br />To Israel's credit, few if any other democracies have been able to survive under the same level of stress.  Moreover, even absent such stresses, few democratic nations are able to integrate such a large minority population as Israel has with the Israeli-Arab community that enjoy all the rights of citizenship of the Jewish majority.<br /><br />I will say that there is the potential for a fascinating book on the topic this book tries to address.  This just is not it.	2001-08-23

No scholars believe these stories to be historic nor is anyone arguing about them.  What the authors have done is create a fictitious argument and then come forward with 'answers.'<br />The rest of the arguments about when stories in the bible were written down, why, and by whom are presented with little supporting data and ignoring the mountain of evidence that contradicts the authors thesis.

Indeed, it is a wonderful tribute to an author and theologian of great potential who was taken from us far too young.<br />The book tells the story of Elisha ben Abuya, one of the contributors to the Talmud who we are told lost his faith.  The Talmud tells us little about him, but Steinberg does a marvelous job weaving the character into a historical tapestry that drapes over one of the great crisis of the Jewish nation, the destruction of the second temple and eventual exile.  Through the book, we meet the various personalities that participated in the writing of the Talmud.  To Steinberg's, each is interesting, unique, and richly brought to life.<br />That said, many people have made the same mistake with this book that they do with other historical fiction; assuming that they can assume Steinberg accurately describes this milieu.  I am fairly certain that were the author alive, he would laugh at such an absurd presumption.  Rather, the genius of this work is that Steinberg projects some of the major problems facing modern Jewry on to an ancient context.  While several of the arguments that appear in the text are historic, the central conflict between Hellenist (secular humanist) philosophy and Jewish ethics is a modern conflict we continue to fight to this day.  Any reader of Rabbi Kaplan, the founder of Reconstructionist Judaism, will recognize many of the arguments that Steinberg puts in his character's mouth as coming from the writings of that modern sage.<br />This book touches modern Jews exactly because it speaks to the trials they face as we weave together and try to make compatible a life of torah and our place in the modern world.  Steinberg speaks powerfully and emotionally to that conflict, recognizing that it is more than simply intellectual, but is also visceral.<br />If you have struggled with such issues, I hearty recommend this work.	2001-08-22

His effort here is to prove that the bible was not just redacted (something every scholar agrees on), but was composed out of hole cloth by scribes at a very point and that the text has no historic basis.  You may want to know why he wants do this, but first lets review the evidence that proves him wrong.  <br />1- Davies tries to argue that biblical Hebrew is a scribal language created by these mysterious scribes to give the text an ancient gloss.  The problem is that we have countless examples of ancient Hebrew from archeology dated 800-1000 years before the time when Davies puts the text as being composed.  Moreover, why can you find no Greek rooted words in the Hebrew Bible, if that was the lingua franca when it was written?<br />2- The Hebrew Bible is filled with place and personal names that were not current in the Hellenistic period, but were in use in the iron age, when most archeologists place the events.  If the redactors were not working from old texts, how would they know the names of places destroyed centuries before?<br />3- The Hebrew Bible  does not represent in any way the dominant Hellenistic world view that was in place when Davies claims the text was written.  In fact you can see this by looking at the book of Daniel, probably the latest book in the bible and the only one to reflect this later world view.<br />Why does Davies ignore all of the evidence to put forward an argument that is patently false?  He is part of a fringe group of scholars, self styled 'biblical revisionists' who are looking to attack the Hebrew Bible in an effort to prove that Jews have no history or historic connection to the land of Israel.  It is pathetic when serious scholars prostitute academic credentials in an effort to make a purely political argument.<br />For a tremendous critique of Davies and his colleagues work, see Dever's &quot;What did the bible writers know.'  Iti s an awful title, but an excellent and thoughtful text.	2001-08-21

Still, its evocative style and powerful prose made a lasting impression.  The author tells a story of two generations of gay men, a father and son in the same family, both in their own particular closets.  The pain these characters suffer is both palpable and moving.<br />Most beautiful is the author's use of the allegory of linguistics and feral children, in particular people struggling to develop a language in which they can communicate.

Moreover, he demonstrates that ad absurdum arguments and straw man debating may sell books, but is hardly scholarship.<br />Thompson claims that he is breaking paradigms in 'biblical archeology' by dismissing the Garden of Eden and the patriarchal period.  The problem is that these are straw men arguments; no serious archeologist working in the Middle East claims that these stories are determinable historic facts.  In fact, it has been decades since anyone made such a claim.<br />Having 'decimated' a position that no one holds, the author than launches into a claim that since these stories of the bible are a historical, than logic dictates that NONE of the bible can be historic.  An analogy would be to read a biography of George Washington that speaks of cutting down the cherry tree, and assuming that if there was no tree, there could have been no Washington.<br />For Thompson, this is accomplished by denying any historical ancient Israel.  To do this he does mental gymnastics that are often self contradictory.  The references to Israel in ancient Egyptian and Assyrian writings are dismissed as forgeries.  He ignores the fact that many of the bible's stories track archeological provable facts like the rise and fall of cities.  The goal here is not scholarship, rather it is a political axe he wants to grind.<br />The entire revisionist school in fact stands on a string of logical fallacies.  They talk about being archeologists, but have never done field work.  They talk about being biblical scholars, but they do not take the text seriously.  The text consistently makes arguments from silence, presenting no evidence or supportive data.  Instead, we have a string of opinions.  What scholar writes a book of this length without even a single footnote?<br />The land between the Jordan and the Mediterranean speaks volumes of the existence of historic Israel.  Only someone wearing blinders would be unable to see it.  If Thompson wants to make an argument, he should present evidence.  Without it, he can offer only polemics and propaganda.<br />Though written by a non-academic (no one is perfect) &quot;Is the Bible True?&quot; by Jeffrey Sheler presents this material in a far more interesting fashion.

Ploni_Almoni's review is exhaustive and he clearly has a great background in archeology.  However, I would like to add a word from a layman who loved this book.<br />Despite this texts awkward title, Dever does an excellent job giving a window into current conflicts in archeology.  Moreover, he demonstrates how a clique of biblical deconstructionists, with little or no background in archeology or fieldwork, has hijacked popular discourse, despite their substitution of ideology for evidence.  He demonstrates how this group has attacked other more serious scholars and made outlandish claims in an effort to grab attention.  Most interestingly, he writes of how deconstructionist methodology, denying that texts can have any intrinsic meaning or that writers can have any intent, is spilling into other fields undermining the work of serious scholars.  These deconstructionists argue that since parts of the bible are provably ahistorical, than the whole text must have no historical basis.  One might just as well argue that if George Washington never cut down a cherry tree, that proves that there was no historical Washington.  His examination of this movement makes for an excellent case study in the history of ideas and a warming about the current struggle going on in academia.<br />Dever also gives a wonderful demonstration of the methodology of modern archeologists.  This window into how they try to reconstruct data is fascinating and extremely accessible.<br />In a world that often elevates ad hominum arguments and poor scholarship, Dever is a noteworthy exception.  If you are at all interested in this topic, I urge you to pick up this book.	2001-08-20

Remini's biography of Daniel Webster proves paradigm deeply flawed, particularly in the early years of our nations history.  <br />Webster, though never achieving the presidency, deserves great credit for setting the tone of american government and the supremacy of congress that survived through the 19th century.  Remini does a tremendous job exploring the early 19th century and the issues this second generation of american leaders faced.<br />Recent great interest in the revolutionary generation hopefully will not eclipse the study of those, like Webster, who came next and solidified the nacient insitutions that the founders created.  If the founders were the fathers of our government, than men like Webster was that government's teacher in primary school.<br />A wonderful read, if you are really interested in the topic.	2001-08-17

Many complain that they are so very different and Simmons changes his style so drastically.  While I cannot argue with the observation, I think the two books are very different and their goal is to tell very different stories.  The first is an exploration of a small group of diverse characters learning about each other and the stange common threat that connects them, in a chaucer like group of short stories.  The second, however, is a powerful adventure story about social evolution, science, and political intrigue.<br />Different?  Yes, but they compliment each other beautifully.  If, like me, you were facinated by the universe Simmons created and the issues of how societies form that he explores, than I think you will enjoy reading this.  Speaking only for myself, I cannot understand how any one who loved the first could dismiss the second, but you will have to find that out for yourself.	2001-08-17

The topics it deals with are deep and complex, so to expect that this book is going to be an easy read is wishful thinking.  That said, it is a very worthwhile read for anyone who struggles with issues of religion and the indentity of the divine.<br />I should say that I am not a Christian, so the the central drama of the book, the apparent contradiction of Jesus being both totaly human and totaly divine is not as emotional to me as it is for others.  That said, many Christians I know have described this book as central to their ability to embrace their faith.  Why?<br />Kazantzakis explore Jesus' humanity in a way to make us feel the character and understand his joys and sorrows.  At the same time, he shows the terror that would acomplish being so completely in touch with the divine.  Most important of all, he shows us the pain of Jesus decision to sacrifice himself on the cross and helps us understand it.<br />Many people find this book very threatening.  That is understandable.  People who believe faith is blind are often troubled by those who dare to look too close.  I have often thought that reading this gave me my best understanding of the passion with which my christian friends view Jesus.  For that reason alone, this is a wonderful and worthwhile read.	2001-08-14

That said, I am certain that, for many Americans, this text will be their introduction to this rather peculiar facet of democracy in the western USA.  <br />Broder does a good job covering the topic in broad strokes, from its origins, to the days when it was used infrequently, to its use now, often  by powerful and wealthy interest groups trying to push their agenda, often with very deceptive tactics.  While he does a good jobs on these topics, as well as bemoaning these initiatives impact on  representitive democracy, he misses several important subjects.<br />Most important, he does not deal with the implication of California's constitution (our basis law) being often radically altered by a vote of 50%+1 of the people who show up at the polls.  Nor does he deal with how the legislature now often won't touch issues, figiuring that they will be covered in the initiative process.  Most importantly of all, he does not lay enough of the blame on elected representitives whose failure to act in face of serious problems has led to many of Californias most famous initiatives (prop 13 and the problem of skyrocketing property taxes being the best example).<br />As I said, this is a good introduction, but a lot more could be written on this important topic.	2001-08-14

Those who hate it complain that the book is short on detail of the how and the why, nor does it go into the exhaustive detail that goes into so many other works that share that tired plot.  At the sametime many who love it, also concentrate on this part of the book.<br />The problem is that, the Axis winning WWII provides only the background for this rich, complex, and ultimately tragic novel.  Like so much of K. Dick's work, he is not interested in overwhelming us with trivial facts or delving deeply into the speculative history.  No, what this author loved were his characters.  The struggles they shared, their many failures and little successes are more important than the world in which they lived.<br />K. Dick writes beautifuly.  Here, as in so much of the rest of his work, he deals with issues of belief and philosphy and the fundemental questions of why are we here and what makes us human.  If you are interested in that topic, read this book.  If you want to know about what would happen had Hitler been left handed or slipped in the shower and died, I suggest you read something else.	2001-08-10

He ties together vast amounts of science, myth, and philosphy on this wonderous journey.  <br />Is the book weird?  Absolutely!  Is it beautifully written and provacitive?  Absolutely!

The riftwar series stands as one of the all time great adventures of high fantasy.  The breath and depth of action, the strong characters, the crisp writing, and suspensful plot all contribute to making that one of the few series that I have read again and again.<br />The second series, though not as good, contained many of the same strengths.  Good characters, fun adventures, and creative plot.<br />That brings us the &quot;Riftwar Legacy&quot; series, a fine example of the danger of writers telling us &quot;the story before the story&quot; in this case made even worse for being based on a video games.  The characters are flat and unintersting (even those like Jimmy the Hand whom I loved in previous books, making it even more painful).  The story is dull and straight out a dozen works by authors of far less ability.  These books contain none of the ethical chalenges that made the others such a delight and catured my imagination.  Great palace intrigue is traded in here for old hack plot devices.<br />If you love Feist's other work, don't waste your time here.  Go back and reread what he has previously written.  This book, and the one that went before, lead only to disapointment.	2001-08-09

Many have complained that it lacks adequate maps and that it does not focus enough on the men on the ground who built the railroad.<br />It is unfortunate that the publisher did not do a better job making clear exactly what this book is about.  All of these complaints are true, but their stories are an aside to the topic of this book.  The chapters dealing with things like the Chinese who built the railroad and the social changes caused by their immigration feel tacked on and not true to the subject of this book.  Indeed all of the engineering and other gritty details about this great monument to ingenuity seem out of place because that is not what this book is about.<br />What is it about?  The struggle for money, power, and the behind the scenes politics that went into the creation of the railroad.  If you are interested in finance or 19th century history, then you may really enjoy this book.  At its best, it focuses on the wealthy men who went from rich to supra-rich through this project.  Their personalities and personal beliefs are explored in great detail.<br />I read this because of my interest in the comparisons often made between the railroads and the internet as market bubbles.  I learned a lot and was not at all disapointed.  Again, only read this if you want to know about the finance, the politics, and the persoanlities.	2001-08-08

Previously, most annalysis has focused on FDR contending with the national forces to his right, in the press, in congress, and in the courts.  Brinkley's work takes an entirely differnet approach, looking instead at the &quot;radicals&quot; who threatened the New Deal from the Left, arguing it did not go far enough.  Moreover, he presents considerable evidence that in forming the New Deal FDR did not compromise to the right, as many have argued, but was actually moved leftward by populist forces.<br />Brinkley also does an excellent job presenting his subjects.  His treatment of Long is a case in point.  He does not seek to cannonize him and brush over his authoritarian leanings, as many have, but nor does he follow the current trend of going in the opposite direction and ignoring Long's acomplishments.  By strikeing a balance, Brinkley gives the reader a greater understanding of the appeal of these men and why they failed.<br />For any reader trying to sort through this complex moment in US history, this is a very worthwhile read.	2001-08-08

More than any other living author, he is sited by the likes of Gaiman, Strazinski, Spinrad and other current greats as the writer who inspires them.  For that reason alone, he should be more widely read.<br />Ellison has, over his 50 years of writting, covered the gamut of topics, from aliens to vampires, androids to Xenobiology in every medium.  However, what makes this author great is that he understands that these topics are also an opportunity to hash out deeper topics of religon, science, and philosophy.  His work is thoughtful, well written, and almost always pervocative.  <br />This collection gives you the chance to work your way through his tremendous and often sureal mind though his work.

The book is so good, that it was even hard to find in libraries because it was so often stolen.  Now at last it is available to the modern reader without having to resort to theft or exauting searches.<br />In this work, the author traces the history of the christian association between the Jew and the Chritian devil from early church history, but with a particular focus on the middle ages.  Many of the myths that many Jewish murders have been based on, right up to the 20th century, have their roots in this period and Tractenberg does a tremdous job exploring them.  While many others have written about this topic, (Moss, Towards the Final Solution being a particularly fine example) none of the more recent works have in any way displaced Trachtenberg's careful study.<br />This is a must for the collection of anyone intersted in this topic or anything else related to European Jewish History.

Unfortunately, I have found that his prose, while excellent when paired with vivid art, often don't stand up on their own.  American Gods demonstates that he is matureing as an author and growing beyond the need for multi-media.<br />Many reviewers have given far too much of this book away.  That is unfortunate and I will not repeat their mistakes.  The book is intersting and fun.  The philisophical conflicts that it embraces harken back to some of Gaiman's best work in Sandman.  The subject matter is engrossing and his strong central character is one that the reader wants to follow.  While I do not think the writing is great, it is good enough to be entertaining and carry a very imaginative story.<br />Gaiman has a gift for vivid imagry and a seemingly endless collection of interesting factoids that continue to peek the readers interst.  This work represents a leap forward for a matureing author.  As such, it a worthwhile read.	2001-08-06

The Authors cover a wide range of topics over a long period of time, any one of which could have been a book unto itself.

Multiple meanings and a tendency towards non-humerous revealing puns add to the richness of ancient jewish texts that is rarely found in english versions.  Like with Fox's Five Books, Give Us a King, brings his enromous ability to bear and gives the reader a window into the hebrew.  Not only does he point out where words can have multiple meansing, he keeps the names in the hebrew form with a definition of the names meaning.  This adds greatly to the text.<br />Another reviewer said that this is begging to be read aloud.  He or she is absolutely correct.  The translation is lyrical, maintaining a 3000 year old jewish tradition of chanting these works.  Many of the english translations attempt to turn these texts into thick prose, which goes directly against the way they are treated in the Hebrew.<br />Fox plans on releasing a translation of everything from Joshua through Kings.

Instead, he attempts to show us what life was like for those on the ground at Stalingrad.  His prose are lucid and convey a great deal of the suffering and pain that the survivors of this titanic battle endured.<br />A fun read for military history buffs.	2001-07-26

Religous christians attack it for being unorthodox.  Religous Jews tend to want to debate its points.  Why?<br />Because Schroeder, a religous Jew, accepts the value of the many supportive texts that Jews read along with the bible.  Christians reject these texts and look mainly to the texts obvious meaning.  That is unfortunate.<br />Imagine, a 12th century Jewish comentator described the &quot;big bang&quot; in almost exactly the way a high school physiscs teacher would in 2001?.  The writers of the talmud saw each stage of creation &quot;evolving&quot; into the next and discussed whether 6 days for the divine was the same as 6 days as they experience it.  For me, such facts are mind blowing.<br />I urge anyone interested in understanding a Jewish approach to the world to read this text.  We believe people were created with reason exactly so we could probe the mysterys of creation and help in the divine plan.  Along with everything else, Schroeder demonstrates that much current science was prefigured by religous scholars who used holy texts as their source.  <br />If you want to understand why faith and reason are not in conflict, I urge you to read this book.	2001-07-25

Much of the subjects prefigured in the show's flash forward scenes take place in this text.  Moreover, it continues the two things that the show so excellent: great stories and solid character evolution over time.  The characters you meet in the first book in the series will have changed mightily by the last.  That is as it should be.<br />Proof of how good this book is that while fans know how it will end, it is still an extremely fun read.	2001-07-25

That is even more amazing, given that Herzog was the President of Israel.<br />The text is very readble, though it sometimes gets bogged down in very minor detail.  That said, Herzog brings the story to life by introducing us to many of the front line commanders whose decisions often dramatically effected the tide of battle.<br />In many ways, the history of the modern middle east is written by wars.  This book provides a wonderful introduction to a most important aspect of this area of study.	2001-07-24

His analysis of the language of the text as well as exploring the multiple possible meanings of the original Hebrew are only part of what makes this an important text.<br />Polzin's literary analysis is also a tremendous addition to the field.  In many areas where the text has been generally thought of as contradictory, he finds plausible interpretations that create continuity and add to the meaning of the text.  Further, his understanding of the redactors possible intent greatly enhances the readers understanding of the primary text.<br />Finally, the theological implications of his commentary deserve consideration.  Polzin brings the characters of Samuel and Saul, two of the Bibles most interesting personalities, fully to life.  His exploration of their flaws and failures as well as their successes makes his interpretations that much more meaningful.  <br />While not always easy, the text is a must addition for any serious or aspiring scholar of these texts.  If you are a beginner, begin with a good translation and easier linear commentary like Alter or Fox.  If you want to go deeper, I urge you to purchase this important text.	2001-07-24

David Alter gives the world one of those rare treatments that succeeds on both scores and provides a truly important addition to biblical scholarship.<br />Alter's analysis of the language can be a true bridge for those who want to know the text but do not speak Hebrew.  By pointing out to the reader places where the language is unclear, he lets him or her make the choice of what the texts real meaning is.  Only the Everett Fox translation is equal or superior.<br />As for commentary, Alter's literary critique of the text helps bring it to life and helps the reader understand how those in the period of redaction read the text.  <br />Alter has already made many noteworthy contributions to biblical scholarship.  With this work, he assures his place in the illustrious pantheon of important biblical scholars.	2001-07-23

The whole &quot;the villan really has a heart&quot; theme was over done before Fate of Bester.  This adds nothing to the genre except a grabbag of overused sci fi cliche.<br />For those who love B5, there is some interesting things here to learn.  Unfortunately, neither the novel nor the series has ever done what it proported to do, namely tell us about the psi wars.  Instead they are skiped over entirely, perhaps because of another planned series.<br />Whatever the reason, only die hard fans will enjoy this.  If you are not, I suggest looking elsewhere. The novel is a quick read,but nothing to write home about.	2001-07-23

By only complaint is that, where the first volume focused on Hitler and his rise, the second spends a great deal of time dealing with the structure and decision making in the Third Reich.  While I found it facinating, it did not give me as much as I wanted about Hitler himself.  The first really tried to get into the man's mind.  The second did not do this to the same degree.<br />My suggestion is read the first volume.  If you loved it, as I did, read the second.

Comparisons between his work to Roth and Mann have become so common that they are almost cliché.<br />This novel represents Chabon's best work to date and his significant maturing as an author.  Like his previous works, the characters are rich and the language artistic.  What he adds to his work with this book is tremendous scope as well as a plot more complex than he has previously attempted.  How does he do?  In short, brilliantly.<br />The work is deep and complex, the character compelling, the prose lyrical.  Often you will find yourself reading a single paragraph three or four times marveling at his mastery of the language.  Also wonderful is Chabon's ear for dialogue, used here to great effect.  I need also add my compliments to his ability as a researcher and his vivid imagination.  <br />Few other authors could give us the tale he here conjures.  I cannot recommend this work highly enough.	2001-07-23

The question will sound absurd, but only until you read this novel.  Many people describe Iron Dream as satire, but I think it is far deeper for such a term.  Rather, Spinrad forces the reader to imagine the world in the way Hitler saw it and then makes you hope his side wins (in this book they are the good guys).  As an intellectual exercise, reading this novel is both exciting and perverse but well worth the read.	2001-07-21

I have to agree with that assessment.  Over the course of the series, Gaiman brings together a wealth of his interests, from Jewish mysticism to Shakespeare.  The sheer scope makes it one of the most ambitious group of books ever written.  Indeed, like the best of fantasy, the author creates an entire new world for us to explore and enjoy.<br />I agree with those who say that this is the weakest of the long series.  That said, it is the first and sets the stage for what comes after.  For those who have not read the series and want to, I suggest reading season of the mist first (book four) and then read from Preludes forward.  Alternatively, you can start here.  The important thing is to not simply read this, get confused and stop.<br />Remember, Gaiman builds on his work towards the end of the story.  Each book adds important characters and facts that recur later.  What seems minor may play a crucial role later in the story.  The series is a must for serious fantasy fans.  If you have never read a graphic novel, here is a great place to start.	2001-07-21

Nonetheless, his crisp prose and enticing style make it a worthwhile read to anyone who is interested in the subject or just in exploring a great novel.<br />In the 17th Century, European Jewish civilization almost collapsed.  Social norms fell apart as people abandoned their homes and their farms in something that can only be described as a mass psychosis.  Satan in Goray tells the story from the perspective of one town.<br />Singer begins to explore a life long interest in the issues of what makes society good and what is evil in this first novel.

I liked it, but did not love it the way many other readers do.  However, Bester's work is an integral step in the creation of modern sci fi.  In many ways his work prefigures great works like Hyperion and Diamond Age.

Interestingly, for all the smoke around the argument no one has been willing to debate the reality that the book addresses or Pius' pivotal place in church history.<br />In the first half of the 20th century, the Roman Catholic Church's primary concern was the rise of communism in Russia, Spain and South America.  Because of that fear, they were willing to make a pact with Hitler.  That pact is not an opinion, but a signed treaty that Pius negotiated.<br />Many other excellent books have dealt with how the Church's perceptions and prejudices towards Jews formed the essential background for the Holocaust (Towards the Final Solution is probably the best work on the subject).  That is not what this book is about and should not be discussed in the context of reviews.  Instead it asks what did the Church do during the war and why did it make the choice that it did.  In the Catholic Church, such study must focus on the pope.<br />Why did the Roman Catholic Church undermine the Roman Catholic Party in Germany, arguably the most successful Catholic party in Europe and the last bulwark against Hitler?  Why was the Church less vocal, even in the name of Jewish converts to Catholicism who the Nazi's murdered?<br />While you can understand neither WWII nor the Church through this one book, it is still worth a critical read by anyone interested in the topic.	2001-07-20

This novel is a fine example of the genius that abounds in this young author.  The scope is dramatic, the characters compelling, and the story engrosses the reader.  When I read it, I could not put it down for three days.<br />In many ways, this is Chabon's best work yet.  I master of style and genre, here the author finds his own voice.  He draws the reader into the joys and tragedies of these characters and brings us to accept the often-outlandish reality of their world.<br />One last note.  I applaud Chabon for his excellent research on the host of diverse topics it took to bring this work to fruition.  From the history of comic books, the Kabalah, to Antarctic exploration, the author clearly spent a tremendous amount of time amassing the details needed to bring this work to life.	2001-07-19

Much has been said in other well written reviews and I do not wish to be repetitive. However, a few things make this work really shine.<br />Chabon's mastery of the language is nothing short of stunning.  Often found myself calling friends to read them paragraphs that were so perfect, they left me gasping.  Indeed, his vivid images and tight lyrical humerous prose will ignite a new appreciation for the written word.<br />He also does a wonderful job of developing a cast of characters, major and minor, that are always intersting.  Moreover, one gets the sense that everything about them is purposeful, designed to make the reader think deeper about the issues Chabon is exploring.	2001-07-19

What makes a citizen?  What is the meaning of responsibility?  What are people's obligations to each other and to their society?  When the movie removed the philosophy in favor of showy violence it also took out the heart that made this novel great.  Indeed, it was reading this as a teenager that first peeked my interest in political theory.<br />Unfortunately, many people have decided that this novel represents the author's ideal society.  Interestingly, Heinlein has an enormous body of work that argues for every social structure from fascisms to anarchy.  What makes his work great, is that each is in some ways compelling in the context in which he presents it.	2001-07-19

In Hyperion, not only does the author createpaint a facinating vision of a new world, but also gives us characters whom we feel for deeply, all in a story filled with intrigue and excitiment.  Lastly, the first two books are written in beautiful prose.<br />Saddly, this work is not up to snuff.  While it ties up many of the loose ends left at the end of the first books, it never grabs the reader in the same way.  Nor does it create the same type of compeling world.  If you loved Hyperion and had questions at the end that you wanted answered, than I suggest you read this.

The cultural impact is momentous and facinating.<br />That said, it takes more than such an inovation to make a great novel.  Simmons' sucess is owed to his tremendous talent in crafting compeling characters and telling each of their stories in their voice.  The varrious stories within the novel run the gambit from 19th century gothic to dime store detective.  Each is well done and would stand alone as an excellent story.<br />I suppose in many ways, this novel (the first and second are the best in the series) are all that this genre aspires to be -- readable, compeling, and intellectually evocative.	2001-07-17

While the character is interesting, she is far less so than the environment she inhabits.  What makes the book worth while is not the main character but the way Golden introduces us to a world that had vannished in fire and smoke, leaving little more than a shadow of its former self.<br />For all of that praise, Golden too often makes the mistake of many first novelists by falling into tired cliche' and over used plot devices.

Bamford gets an F on that test.  The case in point is his coverage of the attack on the USS Liberty.<br />...Lets take a moment and look at the authors actual work in this area to see if he can be trusted.<br />What ever position you take on this argument, several of Bamford sources have come forward and complained that he has misquoted them and taken statements out of context.  Many of the documents he sites that are public are likewise manipulated, often torturously, to fit his argument.  Moreover, he changes several dates to further strengthen his position.<br />Does this mean that he is wrong about the Liberty?  I would say yes, but more importantly, it puts the veracity of his entire book into doubt.  Nor is that the only place his work has been questioned.<br />His last book, The Puzzle Palace, was generally praised for its stright forward journalism, and even several people involved with the NSA praised its acuracy, warts and all.

He also does an excellent job conveying the difficulties of relating to his parents.<br />However, he can never seem to escape from a level of self pity.  Though he ascribes this to his parent's deafness, often one wonders if his feelings are not rooted in his own deep classism.  Much of what he describes as his youthful dificulties are not uncommon to find in the writtings of other children of working class immigrant jews.  The embarassment he feels seems far more driven by this than his parents inability to hear.    <br />I grew a bit tired of his deep self pity, perpetually describing himself as the victim of almost every circumstance.<br />In one poinient passage, he describes how his mother had once been courted by a wealthy english suitor whom she rejected.  He wonders why she chose not marry this &quot;catch.&quot;  I myself wonder if davis would not have much prefered for this to be the case.
