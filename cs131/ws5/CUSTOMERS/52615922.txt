He freely shares what he thinks about the game, opposing players, teamates, and many other subjects.<br /><br />Keane has been criticized for writing this book because he is blunt in his assesments of people and situations.  However, this is the strength of the book, because if Keane had watered it down to be \\"PC,\\" then the reader wouldn't hear what Keane really thinks.<br /><br />Nobody will agree with all of Keane's thoughts, that is a given, but it is interesting to see his development as a player and person.  This book provides the football fan with a glimpse into the mind of a superstar, and whether you like Roy Keane or not, it is a very good read that is enjoyable and insightful.	2005-08-23

Heart breaking losses, non-descript performances, listening to the game on the radio, going out with your friends to watch the game at a pub and having girlfriends who just can't quite understand what the big deal is when your team finally reaches the promised land is just part of the charm that Hornby weaves into this tale of his coming of age with football.<br /><br />Delightful prose adds to one's pleasure, but for the most part this is a funny, yet often times, poignant book.  As a Manchester United supporter, I even found myself identifying with Arsenal (no small feat!).  Highly recommended for anyone who is a fan of English Football, or even for fans of any sport, anywhere.	2005-05-11

A series of articles detailing particular guerillas provides background on each person and the movement they were associated with and includes information on each movement's strategy and tactics.  However, the biggest drawback of this book is Rooney's treating history like it is one damn thing after another.  Rooney fails to show the reader how guerilla warfare has progressed in any way, shape or form.  Instead he concludes that nothing much at all has changed from the time of Sun Tzu.  His conclusion that religion has added a terrible ingredient to terrorism is true enough, but Rooney's thesis that terrorism would not exist to the degree it does if it wasn't for religion lacks evidence to back it up.  Rooney forgets that World War II, replete with terrorist acts, was the bloodiest war ever conducted and at it's root was the atheism of Nazi Germany and of the Soviet Union.<br /><br />Still, all and all, a valuable addition to the subject in terms of the overview of several key guerillas it provides.  It does not advance the thesis of how guerilla warfare is conducted and this is the weakness of the book.	2005-05-10
US	52615922	RXX9TY3B7666B	0375724389	721936771	The Tie That Binds	Books	4	4	9	N	Y	Existential prose painted upon eastern Colorado plains	Kent Haruf crafted an interesting novel about the inner workings of existential life.  The Tie that Binds is a postmodern story with its setting being the simple plains of eastern Colorado in the early and mid 20th century.  The charcters are quite complex, but the underlying gist of the story is their need to find something in a bleak world that has just a bit of meaning, even though this meaning is but an illusion.<br /><br />Edith Goodnough is a picture of Nitsche's nihilism  - bound by constraints that have no meaning, yet unable to see what might lie beyond these constraints.  In fact, there is no reality for her beyond these ties.  Life is so meaningless that the only way to gain freedom is through death.<br /><br />Edith is a nice person, one that carries a sense of duty, one that asks nothing of us.  She is but one of many characters in this novel that don't quite seem to fit in the times in which they are set. The characters should be 21st century characters. Everyone in this novel seems to laugh at the absurdity of life in the existential world they find themselves in, yet they plod along without purpose or passion.  The only thing they seem to consider as real is the stark landscape and the land that produces crops and cattle.  They all just carry on with nothing particularly noble about them, yet they are all simply nice.<br /><br />If you, as the reader, want to read a book that points clearly to the logical conclusion of our secular postmodern world this is the book for you.  A good book for understanding people in our society.	2005-04-22

One of loss and pain without meaning.  It echoes in our postmodern minds - there isn't any meaning to be found, so just make the best of it.  Find some people to attach one's self to and live out a bleak existence.<br /><br />The life in the story is Griff the child.  She still has hope and the others seem to feed off this hope, even though deep down they know it is just an illusion.  Luckily the story ends before Griff learns of the futility of her hope and that there really is nothing out there.<br /><br />If you want to understand the postmodern mind, I would recommend this book.  If you are looking for a masterfully crafted story about the emptiness of the human condition, this is a good one.  But if you are looking for something noble, something that points that there is a deeper meaning to life than just getting through it, you need to look elsewhere.	2005-04-22

This is the classic All-American tale of underdogs who prevail to become champions.  From the owners who experienced tragedy and pain to the jockeys who suffered injuries and illness to a horse who was small and thought to be a be weak to a trainer who was a loner and an enigma this story captures the many elements that worked together to make Seabiscuit one of the most intriguing sports stars of the 20th century.<br /><br />This is truly a book about relationships - with a horse and between people.  The many facets of personality revealed in the story are so very interesting it is simply amazing Laura Hillenbrand was able to capture them so well.<br /><br />Hillenbrand's use of prose is exquisite and truly paints a picture of the many scenes within the reader's eye.  The buildup to the many races of Seabiscuit's career is wonderfully crafted and delivers a ton of excitement.<br /><br />Whether you are a horse racing fan or not, I am convinced that everyone that is interested in the struggle of the underdog will enjoy this story.  It is the fullfillment of the American dream in so many aspects.	2004-08-31

This is a masterpiece in personal and oral history of World War II.  Ambrose focues upon E Company in the 506th Regiment, 101st Airborne and so the center of the book is made up of the men and the experiences they had prior to, during and after the war.<br /><br />Because the focus is so narrow, the reader is treated to intimacies that rarely are put forth in broad histories of World War II.  Sometimes funny, sometimes heart breaking, and often amazing, Ambrose reveals the character and courage of the men of E Company.<br /><br />This is one of the best unit histories ever written about a company in any war.  Highly recommended for those interested in history, but even more so for those who need to gain a perspective of what happened during World War II.  After reading this, I would highly recommend obtaining and watching the DVD that Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg produced that captures so much of this book also entiteld Band of Brothers.	2004-07-23

This book captures the mood, the suffering, and the courage of the men who fought on both sides of the European Theater of Operations during World War II.  Using many interviews and first hand accounts, Ambrose is able to allow the reader to see what the front line warrior was experiencing during battles, movements, and down times.<br /><br />Ambrose weaves the broad perspective into this book, so the reader can understand the overall part each individual and unit is played during the war.  This is a remarkable achievement!  Yet this book is very personal, describing the emotions of the combatants in their own words.<br /><br />If you want to have an understanding of what it ws like to be at the front line in Europe during World War II this is a book you should pick up.	2004-07-23

Halberstam provides a great deal of insight into how each of these individuals played the game and how they competed for the Red Sox amidst hope and disappointment.  The reader learns how each man led his life during his career in baseball and after their playing days ended.

Jay Winik has made a great contribution to American history in his political history of the Civil War, APRIL 1865.  Mr. Winik's thesis is that the magnanimous peace reached by the military combatants combined with the orderly change of power after the assisnation of Lincoln allowed the United States to come together as a nation.<br />It is ahistorical that the United States survived as a republic after a bitter civil war.  Many other countries that experimented with republican forms of governments did not come through civil wars intact.  APRIL 1865 reveals how the United States was able to overcome history and establish a republic out of a diverse people who held various political and lifestyle views.<br />Mr. Winik's research is impeccable and his synthesis of the various information is masterful.  I highly recommend this book to both students of the Civil War and to those interested in political history.	2003-03-30

If you are looking for a book that describes the way Antietam was fought strategically and tactically, look elsewhere.  But if you want to understand the significance this battle had politically, this is your book.<br />McPherson expertly explains that the Battle of Antietam may have been the most important battle fought during the Civil War.  The battle came at a time where the North was militarily on it's heals and the South was close to being recognized by France and England.  The Democrats were making headway in the North, and the upcoming election held the possibility of House of Representatives becoming controlled by the Democrats.  Antietam changes all of this - the Union regains military control, Europe does not recognize the Confederacy, and the Republicans hold the House.<br />But most importantly, Lincoln gains the victory he needs in order to issue the Emancipation Proclemation.  Not only does this free the slaves in the states in rebellion, but it changes the character of the war - from one fought to preserve the Union the way it was before the war to one fought to create a new Union.<br />McPherson has given us an important work in allowing us to see how Antietam changed the war.	2003-03-01

This look allows the reader to see how his outlook on military operations and strategy developed and how he put forth in action his military philosophy during Desert Storm.<br />Schwarzkopf candidly reviews the performance of his army and it's officers during the conflict with Iraq.  This assessment has got him into hot water with the U.S. military establishment, but for the reader it delivers an outstanding behind the scene look at the operation.<br />My only complaint about the book is it's editing.  Many of the stories, while providing a personal glimpse of Schwarzkopf, could have been omitted and the book still would have had the same effect.  But overall, this is an outstanding read and given the current events of 2003, almost a must read for people who want to understand the current conflict with Iraq.	2003-02-05

Reading the Hillerman Navajo mystery series is a joy, and this addition to the series is wonderful!  If you have been reading the series, this book will intrigue you and allow you to see sides of the two main characters, Joe Leaphorn and Jim Chee, that you have not yet seen.<br />The first book of the series to join Leaphorn and Chee, Hillerman develops the inner character of both men and this provides further reason to follow the series.  The men are very real with their everyday concerns and their doggendness in their pursuit of the solution to the mystery.  Hillerman ties the reader to the charcters without pulling at the heartstrings of the reader - in other words, it is not a sappy read, but one that makes one feel they are involved with real people in a desolate, intriguing setting.<br />The mystery is the best of the series to date, one that has twists, turns, and surprises.  As always, the feel of the Navajo culture and the conflicts with the surrounding culture is present.  Well researched and set in the time of the late 1980s, this book gives the reader a true life feel.  If you are a Hillerman fan, you will love this book.  If this is your first look at the Hillerman series, I would strongly recommend reading the series in order - the story within the novels will unravel much more clearly.	2002-07-28

Dallas Willard points the direction to a life of loving God in his book, HEARING GOD.  The path is there to all those who believe in Christ, it is not hidden.  This is not a book about doing what we are told to do, but rather entering into a loving relationship with the Lord and the direction he provides in making us who He wants us to be.  As Mr. Willard writes, &quot;Hearing God is but one dimension of a richly interactive relationship, and obtaining guidance is but one facet of hearing God.&quot;  This book points to a life long relationship with Christ, and will lead the reader into being the kind of person He calls each of us to be.	2002-03-04

I must say - I hate to read books that are supposed to improve your business performance.  Simply hate them!  I was introduced to Leadership and Self-Deception at an unusual place - a church men's breakfast.  The fellow giving the devotional talked about this book and was so enthusiastic I picked it up.<br />To say that I am glad that I did is an understatement.  A practical guide to changing one's outlook on life, not just the way one conducts business.  This book provides a realistic plan to look at one's self honestly and to begin to see reality as it truly is.  So often I look at the world through glasses that are put on to justify my own view.  Applying these principles I am beginning to see things as they are.<br />The principles have improved ALL of my relationships, not just at work, but in every aspect of my life.  I treat people better, because I am putting away my views of them that are not honest, but rather would allow me to continue my own world view.  I see people as they are and am free to treat them as people, not objects.<br />Taking to heart the advice of this book will transform readers.  This sounds like an unbelievable statement, but it really does do just that!	2002-01-22

Paul Little's book, KNOW WHAT YOU BELIEVE, provides an apologetic of the Christian faith in simple, yet elegant terms.  Little provided a straight forward approach to understanding the faith. It is an excellent resource for learning about the Christian faith and can be used as an evangelism tool - either through a pre-Christian reading it, or by providing a Chrsitian the skills to share the faith.<br />This book will enable the reader to draw near to God, as he or she learns about our Father, the glorious Lord Jesus, and the Holy Spirit.  A wonderful experience!	2001-12-20

I happened to hear Lee Strobel preach and was very interested in obtaining his book, THE CASE FOR CHRIST. This book had a profound effect on me. The chapter on the crucifixion is one of the most powerful and detailed accounts of how Jesus was executed. The conclusion of why Jesus took such a horrible torture upon Himself, that it was for love, was enough to make me put the book down and drop to my knees.<br />This book is not exactly neutral in approach. The scholars interviewed are Christian and obviously have a faith that goes beyond the material facts. Yet the facts outlined can be checked out by the curious reader, and the view on the facts turn out to be remarkably objective. This certainly lends credibility to the interview subjects' perspective. There are also a lot of good references listed at the end of each chapter that lend themselves to further study.<br />This is a good book to start with if the reader is looking to discover Christ.  If the reader is already a Christian, this book will guide him or her in building a foundation for an apologetic. The scholars are solid, and the book is full of footnotes and reference material. It is not the be all and end all of who Christ is or apologetics, but it provides a very good start to the curious reader.	2001-12-15

The format of this One Year Bible is great - an Old Testament reading, a New Testament reading, a Psalm, and a Proverb.  It makes for a diverse daily encounter with God and the New Living Translation is a wonderful translation for gaining the same impact the original readers had when they first encountered the text.  Being framed in everyday English, the translation is easy to understand and for me, God speaks to me through this great translation.  I would recommend this Bible to anyone who wants to read the Bible in a year.	2001-11-05

It has brought me closer to the Lord because it seems as if He speaks to me clearly through the text.<br />It is important to note that this is a TRANSLATION and not a PARAPHRASE of the Bible.  It attempts to convey the meaning of the original texts to the reader.  The translators have done well to create the same impact the scripture had to it's original readers by translating entire thoughts into everyday English.<br />I have received a great benefit from this translation of the Word of God, and would not hesitate to recommend it to anyone interested in reading the Bible.	2001-11-05

If you have even the slightest interest in the history of baseball, you must read this book!  Ritter spent hours and hours interviewing the greats of the game and then was able to make these interviews come to life in this splendid piece of history.  You will feel the excitement of the contests, laugh at the off field stories, and learn what it was like to be a big leaguer during the formative years of the majors.<br />So many books using first hand accounts tend to be dry, but this book is the exception.  There is not a dull moment in this book. This book sort of proves Eddie Matthews' review of modern baseball - the guys playing now may be better, but they didn't have as much fun as the guys in the old days.  This book will allow you to enjoy the days gone by of the glorius grand game!	2001-08-19

Buck O'Neil is a man with a story to tell - one of courage, hard work, joy, love, and history.  Homespun, told as if Buck was sitting across from the reader, O'Neil reveals the bright side of a very sad period of history where great players were denied the opportunity to compete in the Major Leagues simply because of the color of their skin, but where great competition and inspiration occurred on the backroads and big cities of America as members of the Negro Leagues played all over the Western Hemisphere.<br />Buck refuses to be sad over the lost opportunity of playing in the Majors, but instead revels in being able to play with and against some of the finest players in the history of baseball.  Because so many of his contemporaries had this same spirit, they enjoyed their lives and ended up paving the way for the Major Leagues to be integrated.  This event is so much more than a mere baseball event, but an event that changed America in a great and grand way!<br />Reading this book was inspirational to me, and let me see that no matter what the circumstances, good can be found if you look for it.  Buck is a person who reveals the secret of life - love others.	2001-08-19

One of the better first hand descriptions of the Negro Leagues by one of the all time great pitchers.  Satchel Paige describes this shameful period in America's history in his own unique way, with homespun language and a flair for entertainment.  Paige expresses the joy of playing baseball and the pain of not being allowed to play in the major leagues until late in his career.<br />This book will let you experience what it was like to be a member of the Negro Leagues with all the barnstorming, year round playing all over the western hemisphere, the games against the major leaguers, and the love of the game experienced on the backroads of America and the big stadiums of the large cities.  These dedicated men paved the way for the intergration of baseball and changed the United States for the better.<br />If you love baseball, purchase this book and learn more about the history of the game - a history that was obscured by the bright lights of the segragated country and big leagues.  You will learn about great players who put it all on the line for the grand old game.	2001-08-19

If you have ever wondered how the players and managers prepare to do the amazing things we see every day of the baseball season this is the book for you!  I have loved the game for my entire life, but I never realized so much preparation goes into every little aspect of the game.  George Will covers each part of the game - pitching, hitting, and fielding - by observing and interviewing some of the greats of the game; Hershiser on pitching, Gwynn on hitting, Ripken on fielding, and Larussa on putting it all together.<br />George Will quoted Wes Westrum in this book - &quot;Baseball is like church.  Many attend, but few understand.&quot;  This book increased my understanding of the game and as a result has added to my enjoyment of baseball.  I see things I didn't see before I read this book - the nuances of the game have become more clear.<br />I did not believe I could love the game more, but after reading this book, I do!  I would highly recommend this book to both students of the game and to newcomers looking to understand the game.	2001-07-04

TALES FROM THE BALLPARK is a quick read that contains poignant, funny, sad, and informative stories.  All of the tales are short (one or two pages) and cover a wide range of subjects - stories about fans, the minors, umpires, old players and modern players.<br />If you are looking for an in depth book about baseball, this one isn't for you.  But if you just want to be entertained for an evening, I would heartily recommend this book.	2001-07-03

In 1987 Alan Bloom wrote THE CLOSING OF THE AMERICAN MIND, predicting the insanity that would result from a politcally correct educational system.  In Martin Gross' book, THE END OF SANITY, it becomes quite apparent that Bloom was absolutely correct.  Gross provides practical examples of what happens when society pursues public opinion over truth.<br />Gross outlines how deconstructionists have supressed reason and denied truth in the name of philosphy.  He points out that current politcally correct thought is evidence of not only the real problems in modern mass societies but also of the superficiality of the response to those very real problems.<br />The decay of our society is a sad thing to witness, let alone read about.  Yet THE END OF SANITY is oddly entertaining, and hopefully will awaken the American spirit before it is too late to be saved.	2001-07-01

Written in 1987, Alan Bloom's book, THE CLOSING OF THE AMERICAN MIND, has proved to be prophetic in it's description of what society would look like if the trend of leftist education continued in American universities.  As Bloom warned, America has become a place where group politics dominate individual rights and the lie of cultural relativism has taken hold.  America is in decay.<br />If you are looking for a book that will describe in detail the philosophical underpinnings of today's politically correct society, as well as the truths that established American society, this is the book you should purchase.  Bloom is profound and provides ample evidence to document his arguments.  You will understand how America arrived to where it is now, and why Americans think the way they do.	2001-07-01

The mystery unfolds in an exciting manner that keeps the reader on the edge of his or her seat.  Hillerman's excellent descriptions of the southwest places you directly in the beautiful land, and his feel for the cultures of the Hopi and Navajo bring to life the people of this region.<br />The story brings the reader to the conflicting lives of drug runners, DEA agents, thieves, the practioners of the Hopi religion, and white people living with the Hopi and Navajo.  Jim Chee as the main character struggles with these conflicts as he tries to solve concurrent mysterys involving murders and missing drug shipments as well as seemingly petty thefts.  Constantly in danger, Chee unravels the connections as he dodges those who would do him harm.<br />On a personal note - I have been reading the Hillerman mysterys in the order they were written and have enjoyed the development of Hillerman as an author.  Each tale becomes more exciting and suspenseful.  It is a very fun way to read Hillerman and I would recommend to anyone to read the books in this manner.	2001-03-17

Alas, I was quite disappointed.  The writing style was plodding, and frankly it was often a boring read.<br />The information contained in this book is quite good.  But Mails jumps around so much between tribes, it is difficult to follow.  The book is broken into two chapters; the first is about the training of young boys to become warriors and the second is about the mature warrior.<br />If you are just looking for information about the life of the Plains Indians(for a term paper or you are just interested), you will probably benefit by purchasing this book.  But if you are looking for a bit of excitement, I would recommend against this one.	2001-02-27

If you want a book that will draw you closer to God, regardless of your religion or beliefs, this is the book.  Frank Fools Crow will teach you by his example what a holy life truly is and the power that will naturally flow from living this type of life.<br />The beauty of the traditional way of the Sioux is also captured in this book.  Yet Fools Crow reaches to the heart of all people with the love he freely gives.  Fools Crow's many gifts are laid out here - his healing ability, his compassion.  It is made clear these are gift's that come from God, not man, and as are to be shared with all.	2001-02-21

Tony Hillerman's The Blessing Way is much more than a mystery - it is a book that allows a close up look at the Navajo and the southwest.  The mystery is great and holds the readers interest, but the reader is also taken to a place of enchantment, where one can almost feel the wind and see the beautiful, but barren, landscape.  Hillerman is a master of creating characters that seem absolutely lifelike in their mannerisms, approach, and emotions.  The culture is presented in a unique, passionate way, that teaches the reader and places a yearning to know more about the Navajo.<br />I would warn the perspective reader of one thing - if this is your first Hillerman book, be prepared to purchase others.  The Hillerman mysteries will grab a hold of you and not let go!	2001-02-21

The characters come to life, and you will find yourself right next to Joe Leaphorn as he searches for clues to solve this mystery of murder and intrigue.<br />All of Hillerman's books are more than just mysterys, and this one is no different.  Zuni culture explored at the finest level enriches this story tenfold.  If you are interested in knowing about a small Native American culture that is difficult to find information about, this book is for you.	2001-02-21

This diet is remarkable and not only that, the food is great!  I have lost weight, toned up, watched my blood pressure go down, and all the while have been eating the best food of my life.<br />The book explains the benefits of eating a balanced diet with plenty of Omega-3 fatty acids.  It also provides some of the most tasty recipes found anywhere.  I have had so much fun sharing this book with friends and loved ones.  As a result, often times when I am over at a friend's house for dinner, I am treated with a great Omega Diet meal!<br />If you want to be on a lifetime plan that will make you (and your taste buds) feel great, buy this book!	2001-02-21

After reading Fools Crow: Wisdom and Power (which is one of my all time favorite books!), I was naturally drawn to reading the biography of Fools Crow.  Alas, I found the book a bit tedious and disappointing.  I am sure Thomas Mails wrote an accurate account, but his style and the points he emphasizes make for a plodding read.<br />Despite these troubles, I found the book to be informative of life on the 20th century Pine Ridge Reservation.  The problems outlined in this book are not going away, and if this book raises concerns about what must be done to correct these terrible issues it has done a great service.<br />This book is also very good in regards to giving a history of the Sioux since the Great Sioux War of 1876.  So often the history of this great nation is placed in the background to the white culture making it difficult to see with any degree of accuracy.  This book is from the vantage point of a Sioux elder and tells the sad tale of an oppressed people.	2001-02-21

More than a mystery where the reader can gage the facts in order to learn the many answers, one must become involved in the heart and customs of the Navajo if you are to hope to solve this tale before the end.<br />In The Listening Woman the reader becomes a part of the action.  This is largely due to the awesome descriptions of the land and the people, along with the situations which keep you on the edge of your seat!  The characters come to life and the empathetic reader will cry and laugh with them.  You will also feel the fear of being pursued by an unbelivable beast and the dark terror of being trapped with little hope of escape.<br />A word of warning - you may need to set aside a few hours to read this book because it will be difficult to put down!	2001-02-21
