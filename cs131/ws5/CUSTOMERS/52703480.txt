I'm sure there are mistakes in the translation but this book captures Ruy Castro's writing voice amazingly well. It's really a sweet book, a sweet story and of course sweet music. I know next to nothing about pre-Bossa Brazilian music and I wasn't confused. I did keep a pad by the book to write down names of singers and songs I need to search for. It's fascinating how all these different stories led to Bossa Nova. It's a lot more diverse than you'd think. I only wish there was a companion CD to hear all this great music, especially the more obscure early stuff.	2002-10-11

The cover is kind of &quot;blah&quot; but there's lots and lots of really god solid information inside. In fact, so far every question I've had has been addressed. A lot of the other books seem big on theory (&quot;You must be organized!&quot;) but this book has the nuts and bolts. In fact, it's the only one that sits on my desk. The others are nicely preserved on my bookshelf.	2002-09-11

If Chilaquiles made with &quot;crushed tortilla chips&quot; and Velveeta are a good idea, look no further! I've never been to this restaurant but I've never been less inspired than I was from reading this book. If you like quick, easy and apparently bland food, this might make it but if you love Mexican food you will be bored and occasionally horrified! Great graphics. It's too bad because I was really looking forward to this one.	2002-07-24

Just swell, but why leave out the basics? Regular vegetables deserve the same deluxe treatment! It wouldn't have been much more work and it's not clear from the title (I'd say zucchini are prettyu common)that only selected vegetables are represented. Other than that, it's great.

There were interviews but the bland voice that tells this story is the author's. Jean Boyd is not a storyteller. A lot of the information conflicts with what I've read elsewhere but there is no perspective. Also odd is to seperate the chapters by instrument so there is no chronological sense. It then becomes the story of the mucians. It's interesting but not a great book.	2001-06-11

Thge authors are so busy being innovative (and often pushing reality beyond its limits) that they forget you how to make a delicious regular old tamal!	2001-06-11

He even criticizes architecture as &quot;Nixon-era&quot;. This is ridiculous and waters down his very important message about what's wrong with they way we eat and even more importantly, what's wrong with America. I just think the problem is bigger and more expanisve than the Republican party. By the by, I almost always vote Democrat.	2001-04-23

Books	3	158	169	N	N	Should have been better	I'm the biggest Diana Kennedy fan ever. I wouldn't be without her earlier books except MY MEXICO, which is good but for me not essential. This is a compilation and some things are cut, some are added and some recipes refer to the earlier books that this one volume is supposed to replace. An example is tamales. Her earlier books have pages of instructions and theories in addition to stories. Here, we get the same story but then are referred to CUISINES OF MEXICO for detailed instructions for tamale masa. CUISINES has overly-pedantic recipes in the style of MASTERING THE ART OF FRENCH COOKING so the update in style is welcome, but I wouldn't dream of not having the complete versions of the earlier books. Personally, I think her editor needs to be spanked.	2001-02-01

I've always admired Cybill and found her interviews intelligent and interesting. This book is very sloppy and she comes off as half-baked. She also makes MANY mistakes. the song &quot;I'm a fool to want you&quot;  becomes &quot;I'm a fool to love you&quot;, she describes an orchestra as  &quot;the 101 strings of Montovani&quot; when in fact they were two bands  (101 String, Montovani and his orchestra) and worse, she credits Cole  Porter with writing Noel Coward's Mad About the Boy.  You also get the  feeling she's not telling the whole story, especially when people are  irrational or nasty to her.	2000-07-11

On the whole, it's a nice balance of his life and his art. But there are too many stupid little mistakes that I caught, it makes me wonder how much  more I missed. I'd be happy to help fix future editions of this book!  Examples: Elvis Presley never recorded for Capitol (he recorded for RCA)  Oscar Moore went left the trio top play with his brother's band. Epstein  makes this sound like a step down into obscurity. He doesn't even mention  the while white-hot member, Charles Brown.	2000-03-08

This kind of punchy &quot;clever&quot; writing might work for a magazine but is very hard to read for an extended period time, as in a  book. There are lots of weird mistakes (is the author English and missing  some things?) and the font used is almost illegible.

Aside from theauthor's ego, which is almost laughable, look at his sites. they're ayawn, especially considering all the time he spent designing them. the best example is of the Jimtown store. I've been to both the store and the site and the site doesn't even come close to refecting the store. Seigel spends paragraphs explaining how he came up with his ideas and their execution but it's a very mediocre site. He's an OK technician but his design taste is very first generation.	1997-06-11
