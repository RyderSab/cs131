Philanthropy, Patronage, and Civil Society is a collection of the work of such scholars. Thomas Adam has compiled ten essays examining impact of the transatlantic influence of philanthropists and patrons on the changing cultures of Germany, Great Britain, Canada, and the United States.<br /><br />Philanthropy, Patronage, and Civil Society is packed with information and new ways for practitioners to look at the roots of early modern philanthropy. I was intrigued by the way \\"philanthropy\\" has been defined over the years. I was also surprised to see how important philanthropy was in the life of Germany before the twentieth century. In fact, in his essay, Thomas Adams argues that philanthropy is not an American invention but really comes from Europe.<br /><br />Because Philanthropy, Patronage, and Civil Society is written by scholars for scholars, it is a bit dense to read. It helps if you can find a personal connection with some aspect of each chapter as I did in the sixth chapter with the discussion of Leipzig's Gewandhaus Orchestra. (A friend of mine from high school is part of this orchestra.)<br /><br />I found the section on Jewish philanthropy particularly interesting. One essay explores the different experience of the German Jews as a minority population and the U.S. Jews as just one immigrant population among many others. It's also fascinating to see how philanthropy became a bridge between Jewish people of different religious beliefs.<br /><br />Philanthropy, Patronage, and Civil Society definitely delivers on its promise to give a thorough historical comparative look at the transatlantic nature of philanthropy in the eighteenth through early twentieth centuries.<br /><br />CONTENTS<br /><br />PART I: PHILANTHROPY IN A TRANSATLANTIC WORLD<br /><br />1.

His books Permission Marketing, Unleashing the Idea Virus, Purple Cow, and The Big Red Fez continue impact me on an almost daily basis. One thing I love about Seth is that he persuasively argues that in today's economy thinking on-the-edge is far safer than maintaining the status quo.<br />In Purple Cow, Seth argued that businesses and nonprofits need to be remarkable in order to survive. Being remarkable means that people will tell their friends about your product or service. Purple Cow was a thought provoking book but was lacking in helping readers implement the ideas. Free Prize Inside takes it the next step and shows us how to market and create remarkable changes in our organizations.<br />Free Prize Inside is divided into three sections:<br />* Why You Need a Free Prize<br />* Selling the Idea<br />* Creating the Free Prize<br />A \\"free prize\\" is a soft innovation. Seth builds the case for the urgent need of people in all organizations, including nonprofits, to be championing soft innovations. Soft innovations are the \\"clever, insightful, useful small ideas that just about anyone in an organization can think up.\\" A free prize may seem like a gimmick at first but it actually becomes an essential part of your product or service. We all know what our favorite cereal tastes like, but it becomes irresistible when we see we can get a free prize inside the box. To illustrate his point, Seth is selling the first printing of this book in a special-made cereal box! You can pre-order a copy at Amazon.com.<br />He's convinced that anyone can come up with a free prize inside. The problem comes when we share it with others. Seth says our co-workers or boss, ask three basic questions:<br />1. Is this idea doable?<br />2. Is it worth doing?<br />3. Are you the one able to do it successfully?<br />If they aren't able to answer \\"yes\\" to all three questions, they won't join you, and the idea will die. The second section of the book is dedicated to specifically showing us how to keep our innovations alive by championing them and winning the support of others. After all, creating a free prize isn't important if we can't sell it to our organization.<br />The last section is dedicated to creating the free prizes. What would make your organization remarkable? Here Seth introduces his new concept of \\"edgecraft.\\" He explains, \\"You're...caught in the center of a web of boring. The goal of edgecraft is to pick an edge (there are hundreds to choose from) and go all the way with it-even a little further than that if you can. Moving a little is expensive and useless. Moving a lot is actually cheaper in the long run and loaded with wonderful possibilities.\\"<br />Donuts are boring but Krispy Kreme found an edge and made them sensational. Netflix did the same with movie rentals. They created a free prize by transforming the rental experience and created a very loyal customer following. The United Way found free prize when they discovered the concept of payroll deduction. Pushing that edge has helped them raised a lot of money!<br />Free Prize Inside is an inspiring and practical way for us to find our organization's edges and push for a free prize. It comes with extensive endnotes that cite Seth's sources, expand on points, and point you to great information on the web. I particularly appreciate Seth's constant attention to the nonprofit sector throughout the book. I highly recommend getting a copy. And, if you order it before it's published in May, you can still get it in a cereal box!wing us how to keep our innovations alive by championing them and winning the support of others.

Many of them sound like they're copies of each other--different authors simply regurgitating the same worn-out ideas and stories. \\"Get the Prize\\" isn't one of these.<br />The concepts Larry Hehn writes about aren't new. And that's a good thing. He's writing about timeless principles. Would they be \\"timeless\\" if they were new? In fact, his \\"nine keys\\" are firmly grounded in biblical truths.<br />What makes \\"Get the Prize\\" stand out is that Hehn expresses these truths with completely refreshing originality. The source of that originality is his life experience. Often the stories in books of this type are little more than watered down cliches. By using the story he knows the best, his own, he breathes new life into changeless truths.<br />\\"Get the Prize\\" could be a book that will change your life, if you back up what you read with action. It can be read from cover to cover or used as a workbook to assess and redirect your life. Personally, I didn't find the workbook-like questions helpful.

I was hoping to help a colleague wrestle with how to apply fundraising techniques with attention to these cohorts. Having read the authors' 13th Gen a few years ago, I knew this would be an erudite review. I got what I was looking for and much more! &quot;The Fourth Turning&quot; is actually a compelling look at human history, especially Western history since the middle of the fifteenth century!<br />Howe and Strauss have amazingly taken the most recent 20th century generations (GI, Silent, Boomer, Xer, and Millennial) and found corresponding generations for the last few hundred years. From this, they've developed a convincing rubric of generational archetypes-GIs and Millennials are the \\"Hero,\\" Silents are the \\"Artist,\\" Boomers are the \\"Prophet,\\" and Xers are the \\"Nomad.\\" Moreover, they've revisited the millennia old theory that time moves through seasons in a cyclical pattern, one that corresponds with the seasons of the year. The post-WWII era was our \\"High\\" or spring; the Consciousness Revolution was our \\"Awakening\\" or summer; the 80's and 90's was our \\"Unraveling\\" or fall; and we're currently headed for our \\"Crisis\\" or winter. They chose to label the seasons \\"turnings\\" and the time encompassing the four turnings as the \\"saecula,\\" a label used by the ancients that roughly corresponds to a century.<br />With an amazing attention to detail, a scholarly eye to history, and a wonderfully readable writing style, Howe and Strauss show the interplay of the generational archetypes and the turnings. For example, they point to the similarities of the spiritual emphasis of the 1960s and 1970s with the Transcendentalists of the 1800s, the Great Awakening of the 1700s, and the Puritan Awakening of the 1600s, and the Protestant Reformation of the 1500s!<br />&quot;The Fourth Turning&quot; will definitely affect the way you view history as well as the events of today. Though written in 1997, they illustrate \\"highly unlikely\\" scenarios that might precipitate the coming Crisis such as: \\"A global terrorist group blows up an aircraft and announces it possesses portable nuclear weapons. The United States and its allies launch a preemptive strike. The terrorists threaten to retaliate against an American city...\\"!<br />While I don't know if we're currently into the Crisis or not, I do know that &quot;The Fourth Turning&quot; is a must read for anyone trying to raise money in today's economic environment. Not only will the savvy fundraiser ferret out ways to frame their case for the different generations, she will also see how different turnings may affect fundraising efforts. If we are indeed heading for a fourth turning, and Howe and Strauss make that highly believable, I think we in the nonprofit world are uniquely situated to help our cultures ride out this winter and successfully enter the spring.<br />Although full of grim warnings, &quot;The Fourth Turning&quot; is a hope-filled book well worth reading.<br />CONTENTS:<br />1.

However, as a fundraiser for a secondary school, I found this brief book to be informative and eye-opening.<br />The Fundraising Houseparty is expensive for its size and is hard to find on sites like Amazon.com (even with the ISBN number). Nevertheless, it a can be a worthwhile investment of time and money for the potential relational and financial rewards of a fundraising houseparty.<br />Warshawski is quick to admit that not all houseparties are financially successful. Care must be taken. But it's hard to imagine losing money if following his detailed advice. Someone brand new to personal asks will find this work helpful. I believe an experienced fundraiser may find it beneficial as well.<br />The process begins with a planning committee to work out event details and host/hostess who personally signs event invitations. Invitations are sent to potential donors, clearly stating that the gathering will be a fundraising event. Houseparties start with a time of mingling and light refreshments. Then the person seeking the funding makes a brief presentation describing the project. Working with film projects, Warshawski is a proponent of using some form of video presentation-to showcase the artist's prior work and to, ideally, tug at the hearts of the participants. The key to the whole event is the solicitation by a well-respected peer. Follow-up is an important final stage of the fundraising houseparty.<br />Warshawski's work is eminently practical. Packed with checklists, annotated outlines, attractive and informative (and humorous) samples of invitations, and even scripts for the presenter and peer solicitor. It's easy to read in 30 minutes and fits very conveniently in your pocket.<br />I definitely recommend reading The Fundraising Houseparty, although you might want to loan a copy from someone rather than purchase it yourself. I'm excited to see how the fundraising houseparty concept will fit into my school's fundraising efforts!<br />Chapters include:<br />Introduction<br />Key Elements<br />Pre-Party Checklist<br />The Party<br />Some Last Notes<br />Appendix<br />Bibliography<br />About the Authoro see how the fundraising houseparty concept will fit into my school's fundraising efforts!<br />Chapters include:<br />Introduction<BR>Key Elements<BR>Pre-Party Checklist<BR>The Party<BR>Some Last Notes<BR>Appendix<BR>Bibliography<BR>About the Author	2003-06-19

What does a Las Vegas casino, Peter Drucker, and Huffy have in common? Or how about Frank Lloyd Wright, Habitat for Humanity International, and a gold mining company? According to Donald Mitchell and Carol Coles, all six have successfully implemented multiple business model innovations. They use these, and dozens of other companies, to argue that the ultimate competitive advantage today is continual business model innovation.<br />Mitchell and Coles begin The Ultimate Competitive Advantage with some bold claims about the relevance of their work. Daring statements like \\"This is the book we've always wanted...but could never find\\" and \\"There have been many studies of `strategic best practices,' but none quite like or as significant to you as what you are about to read here\\" fill the opening pages of the book. These initially turned me off, but after reading The Ultimate Competitive Advantage, I believe these claims have merit.<br />The Ultimate Competitive Advantage is based on years of research done by Mitchell and Coles and their firm, particularly since 1992. They claim this research, which includes the recession of the recent years, is more real-time than the works of others that amount to a backward look at past successes. As they examined the companies that repeatedly met their criteria, they noticed many had undergone one or more major business innovations. They then investigated other public companies that had undergone at least two successful business innovations during the same period. Mitchell and Coles used the themes from this investigation to look for smaller companies and nonprofits that exhibited similar characteristics and personally followed up with dozens of organizations.<br />The fruit of all their research is a very readable book that is suitable for leaders in practically any organization. I found myself enthralled by the real life examples given throughout the book. Even the \\"key questions\\" at the end of the chapters captured my attention. I usually skip over these because they often feel like an excuse to fill up more pages. But in The Ultimate Competitive Advantage, I found myself torn between wanting to move on to the next chapter and wanting to stop to work through these end-of-chapter questions.<br />An eminently practical and readable guide, The Ultimate Competitive Advantage is full of unexpected twists on ideas and concepts. The authors even weave a lemonade stand business through the various stages of the book!<br />Toward the end of the book, Mitchell and Coles state, \\"When a paved road becomes a muddy track appearing to lead nowhere, you should realize you may have taken a wrong turn.\\" If you're in leadership of a company, a start-up, or a nonprofit and the once well paved road to organizational success is looking muddy, do yourself a favor and read this book. And if your road still looks paved, reading The Ultimate Competitive Advantage may be a good bit of preventative medicine to jump start your thinking and keep you moving along.<br /><br />CONTENTS:<br />Foreword by B.

What do you get when you cross to leaders-one in business (Augustine), the other in government (Adelman)-with arguably the most influential bard in history? A fun and informative look at business, life, and, of course, Shakespeare.<br />Augustine and Adelman have modeled Shakespeare in Charge, appropriately, after a typical Shakespeare play. The authors use the prologue and epilogue to make a case for learning present day lessons from very old plays and applying those lessons to life-not just business.  If you read nothing but these two sections, you'll be better for it.<br />If you're a reader of leadership books, you've probably heard all the lessons before: have a clear mission, be a decisive leader, stick to core competencies, manage by walking around, be flexible, have corporate succession plans, make back up plans, and keep business meetings brief. But I bet you haven't heard them quite like this!<br />As in Shakespeare's plays, the heart of the book is broken into five Acts. Each Act is a study of a character from one of the bard's plays and is followed by \\"Acting Lessons\\" which draw on scores of present day business examples to further illuminate the points made. The characters examined are:<br /> ·Henry V (Henry V, leadership);<br /> ·Petruchio (Taming of the Shrew, change);<br /> ·Ceaser, Cassius, Brutus, & Antony (Julius Ceaser, \\"making your play in business\\");<br /> ·Portia (Merchant of Venice, risk management);<br /> ·and Claudius (Hamlet, crisis management).<br />I was pleasantly surprised by the characters they chose, particularly by bringing light to the important role of Portia and, more surprisingly, by drawing important lessons from Hamlet's usurping uncle Claudius. While each Act has a primary character, the authors borrow freely from other plays and some sonnets.<br />You certainly don't need to be a Shakespearean scholar (or even a Shakespearean student!) to understand, appreciate, and enjoy the lessons to be learned. Augustine and Adelman do an incredible job giving enough background and quotations to make you feel at home.<br />Shakespeare in Charge cites dozens of real-life business examples some as well known as Amazon.com, Southwest Airlines, and Coca-Cola; and less known ones such as Half Price Books, Mine Safety Appliances Company, and Rachel's Bus Company. A product of the time it was published, they even praise the leadership of Enron.<br />Having earned my MA in Organizational Leadership, I've read many books on leadership. It was obvious to me that the authors had leadership experience because they mixed \\"subordinate buy-in\\" and \\"consulting advisors\\" with \\"decisive leadership\\" and the importance of a \\"single leader.\\" Many tend to stress either participation and teamwork or strong individual leadership. They do a great job of advising both.<br />Shakespeare in Charge doth serve its proposed purpose. Methinks this dost make a fine tome!<br />CONTENTS:<br />Prologue<br />Act I: On Leadership<br />Act II: Confronting Change<br />Act III: Making Your Play in Business<br />Act IV: Risk Management<br />Act V: Crisis Management<br />Epilogueincredible job giving enough background and quotations to make you feel at home. <br />Shakespeare in Charge cites dozens of real-life business examples some as well known as Amazon.com, Southwest Airlines, and Coca-Cola; and less known ones such as Half Price Books, Mine Safety Appliances Company, and Rachel's Bus Company.

Do Christian organizations and development officers fundraise in a way that appeals to motives \\"at odds with the teachings of their faith\\"? Are they simply interested in getting a dollar or equally interested in nurturing the spiritual life of donors? These questions are important since, as the authors assert, \\"Some fundraising appeal or another is quite likely to be the first-and may be the only-contact of the unchurched with Christianity today.\\" Does this fundraising reflect the Gospel?<br />Jesus warned us, \\"No one can serve two masters...You cannot serve both God and Money.\\" Growing Givers' Hearts begins be surveying the theology of giving in the Hebrew Scriptures, the New Testament, and throughout the history of the Church. This initial section alone is worth the price of the book.<br />The largest part of Growing Givers' Hearts is based on a three-year study funded by the Lilly Endowment. Jeavons and Basinger explored six organizations that are successful at both raising funds and encouraging the spiritual growth of their donors and identified six \\"necessary conditions\\" for such a program. These organizations are: Compassion International, Union Gospel Mission of Seattle, the Catholic Charities of Cleveland, the Roman Catholic Diocese of Tucson, San Francisco Theological Seminary, Fuller Theological Seminary, and Biola University. The six conditions are the chapter headings for \\"Part Two\\" listed below.<br />The final section moves from the organizational perspective to that of the individual. These chapters are a challenge and an invitation to the ministry of fundraising. Jeavons and Basinger offer specific insights into how the \\"necessary conditions\\" flow out of our daily lives.<br />Written for a decidedly Christian audience, Jeavons and Basinger have tried to be inclusive of the Roman Catholic, Protestant, and Evangelical traditions and vocabulary. The book is filled with concrete, but not formulaic, suggestions and practices of those that treat fundraising as ministry. These well-placed, compelling examples ground the principles in real life and make the Growing Givers' Hearts approach even more believable.<br />I highly recommend Growing Givers' Hearts!

Warren Bennis' claim on the back cover that this is \\"the single best book on women and leadership\\" whet my appetite. However, as a leadership book, I found Women of Influence, Women of Vision to be very disappointing.<br />If you read only the ninth chapter \\"A Leadership Legacy, A Leadership Resource\\" you would think this book redefined the study of leadership. It sounds quite impressive. I wonder if Bennis and the others quoted on the cover were only able to read this chapter. Having read the whole book, I feel the authors wield hyperbole a little too freely in this chapter. Claims are made that are not supported by the rest of the work.<br />The authors claim to study a broad range of women leaders, positional and nonpositional. But they later admit that those they interviewed are \\"quite homogeneous in their professional base and education.\\" The authors divided their sample into three \\"generations\\"-Predecessors, Instigators, and Inheritors. Do not confuse these \\"generations\\" with the more common Veteran, Boomer, Xer labels! These generations each represent more-or-less a decade of the women's movement: the Predecessors led during the 1940's and 1950's; the Instigators during the first decade of the movement; and the Inheritors were coming to leadership in the second decade.<br />One of the major shortcomings of this book was in the area of leadership succession. The authors claimed this was one of the five key elements of the conceptual framework they devised. They did mention some of the leadership succession that happened between Predecessors and Instigators. However, the quotes of those interviewed and the authors themselves indicate a growing concern of the \\"graying\\" of the movement. If the movement is not attracting and developing younger leaders, can it really be doing a good enough job with leadership succession to help create a framework for a study for others to use?<br />While this book fails in furthering the study of leadership, it does a wonderful job of shedding light on some of the essential players in the women's movement. I have a much better understanding of the historical context of the social change feminists brought about in a mere thirty years. I now know what Executive Order 11246 is and why it is important. I am glad the authors were able to put this valuable information in print.<br />There are some relevant points that can be extrapolated for students of leadership. The authors stress that the women they studied viewed power as an expandable resource \\"that is produced and shared through interaction by leader and followers alike.\\" I found that viewpoint to be refreshing in a world where power is often seen as something to be grasped for like the brass ring on a carousel.<br />Flowing from that view of power, the authors continually noted the social networks maintained by the leaders they interviewed. Despite the loneliness that leaders often feel, these women worked hard to create a network of peers to support each other and be change agents. I think all leaders could learn from this.<br />I am glad I read Women of Influence, Women of Vision. I do not think it is as revolutionary as the cover claimed or the authors might have hoped it would be. The book succeeds as a wonderfully personal history of women who have brought about great social change. I wish it had been marketed as such. Maybe it was and I just missed it.<br />Table of Contents:<br />1. A New Perspective on Leadership<br />2. In the Spirit of the Times: Three Generations of Women Leaders<br />3.

Work and Rewards is chock full of useful information. Crandall and Wallace write mainly for organizations that resemble their clients -- corporations that manufacture goods for profit. But I think this book is even of value for non-profits. While obviously helpful for human resource people, this book would be beneficial reading for CEOs, top organizational leaders, and even frontline supervisors.<br />&quot;The job is dead,&quot; the authors declare. &quot;Job&quot; is part of the &quot;old deal&quot; marked by cradle-to-grave security. &quot;The New Deal will require us to act as adults, not children.&quot; Employees will be increasingly responsible for acquiring the skills needed by their employers. Narrow job descriptions are already giving way to broader, more flexible skill sets. The authors claim this shift will help organizations run more effectively and will increase worker satisfaction.<br />Don't be mistaken; Work and Rewards is not a pie-in-the-sky futurists dream. It is based on the real life experiences the authors have had with dozens of clients, including Sony, Corning, and others. Work and Rewards is packed with practical models, steps, outlines, case studies, plans, and formulas. These tools can help organizations evaluate the cost of going virtual, determine what key drivers the organization wants to reward, and how to manage the transition.<br />I highly recommend Work and Rewards.<br />Chapters include:<br />1. Forging a New Compact Between People and Technology<br />2. Working in the Virtual Workplace<br />3. Exploring the Virtual Workplace<br />4. Work Design<br />5. Skills and Competencies<br />6.

This is an amazing book! Peter Block's Flawless Consulting, is a textbook appropriate not only for consultants but for anyone that wants to share their expertise with others. Block explains, \\"You are consulting any time you are trying to change or improve a situation but have no direct control over the implementation.\\"<br />About his audacious title, he asserts that it is possible for us to operate without error. To consult flawlessly \\"requires intense concentration on two process. (1)Being as authentic as you can be at all times with the client; (2)Attending directly, in words and actions, to the business of each stage of the consulting process.\\"<br />Having set the bar extremely high, Block doesn't leave the reader trying to figure out what \\"being authentic\\" and \\"attending to the business of each stage\\" means. Flawless Consulting is an extremely practical book. Flawless Consulting is replete with checklists, case scenarios, suggested wording (sometimes entire scripts), business recommendations, and practical insights. The book is saturated with Block's wonderful sense of humor and humanity.<br />Unlike some second editions that are content to simply add a new preface and some cosmetic changes to the dust jacket, Block has updated information throughout the book and added entirely new chapters on: Whole-System Discovery, Implementation, Strategies for Engagement, Ethics and the Shadow Side of Consulting, The Heart of the Matter.<br />Though not a consultant in the formal sense, I found his insights delightfully applicable to my day-to-day work. So much so that I nearly underlined every line in the book and made notes in the margins! Despite all the great information I gleaned, I think people more formally involved in consulting will get even more from Flawless Consulting. I highly recommend this book for anyone who interested in Getting Your Expertise Used.<br />In addition to the two prefaces, the chapters are:<br />Chapter 1 A Consultant by Any Other Name<br />Chapter 2 Techniques Are Not Enough<br />Chapter 3 Flawless Consulting<br />Chapter 4 Contracting Overview<br />Chapter 5 The Contracting Meeting<br />Chapter 6 The Agonies of Contracting<br />Chapter 7 The Internal Consultant<br />Chapter 8 Understanding Resistance<br />Chapter 9 Dealing with Resistance<br />Chapter 10 From Diagnosis to Discovery<br />Chapter 11 Getting the Data<br />Chapter 12 Whole-System Discovery<br />Chapter 13 Preparing for Feedback<br />Chapter 14 Managing the Feedback Meeting<br />Chapter 15 Implementation<br />Chapter 16 Strategies for Engagement<br />Chapter 17 Some Tools for Engagement<br />Chapter 18 Ethics and the Shadow Side of Consulting<br />Chapter 19 The Heart of the Matter<br />Appendix Another Checklist You Can Use (7 checklists actually)/>Chapter 2 Techniques Are Not Enough<BR>Chapter 3 Flawless Consulting<BR>Chapter 4 Contracting Overview<BR>Chapter 5 The Contracting Meeting<BR>Chapter 6 The Agonies of Contracting<BR>Chapter 7 The Internal Consultant<BR>Chapter 8 Understanding Resistance<BR>Chapter 9 Dealing with Resistance<BR>Chapter 10 From Diagnosis to Discovery<BR>Chapter 11 Getting the Data<BR>Chapter 12 Whole-System Discovery<BR>Chapter 13 Preparing for Feedback<BR>Chapter 14 Managing the Feedback Meeting<BR>Chapter 15 Implementation<BR>Chapter 16 Strategies for Engagement<BR>Chapter 17 Some Tools for Engagement<BR>Chapter 18 Ethics and the Shadow Side of Consulting<BR>Chapter 19 The Heart of the Matter<BR>Appendix Another Checklist You Can Use (7 checklists actually)	2002-06-28

The Seven Faces of Philanthropy offers a very helpful donor-centered approach to interacting with donors.<br />Although thoroughly researched, the authors' humility is also refreshing. Prince and File specifically say they are not offering a framework that supplements, not replaces, the strategies and techniques our offices are using. Later, they acknowledge the limits and constraints with this framework but affirm that the strength is in the process.<br />Throughout the book, actual comments from donors illustrate the points the authors are making. I could almost hear donors I know talking to us through those quotations! As I read The Seven Faces of Philanthropy, I found myself scribbling notes in the margins about how I could implement the framework in my daily work.<br />I was disappointed that this reprint merely had a new introduction. Part Two is laden with statistics and I found myself wondering how they have changed in the last ten years. Nevertheless, this book is well worth reading and implementing.<br />In addition to a preface, two introductions, and a research appendix, the chapters include:<br />Part One: Profiling the Seven Faces of Philanthropy<br />1.

While Benfari definitely is well versed in management theory, he's packed this book full of dozens of practical tools, advice, and descriptive case \\"studies.\\"<br />After reading &quot;Understanding and Changing Your Management Style,&quot; I've come to see that books on management are often like the three blind men trying to describe the elephant-they each describe focus on one aspect of the whole. Benfari attempts to take in the whole picture and help the reader understand all the aspects of managing. Quite a daunting task!<br />In the introduction, Benfari says, \\"The most fruitful way of working through the book is to take the assessment in the appendixes before you start your journey\\" (p. xii). I was already familiar with the Myers-Briggs profile but much less familiar with the influence inventory, and the assessments of needs, conflict resolution style, problem solving style, values, and stress. I spent so much time assessing; I almost gave up on the book without even reading the first chapter!<br />I'm glad I gave the book a chance. This book is Benfari's explanation of his \\"integrated management style.\\" In his words, \\"Changing your management style is possible once you understand what can be changed (and what cannot) and are willing to do the work to shift your assumptions, perceptions, and behavior\\" (p. xi). We can't change our basic wiring-personality-but we can change most everything else. Benfari even offers techniques on influencing and temporarily flexing our personality tendencies.<br />At times, I found &quot;Understanding and Changing Your Management Style&quot; to be somewhat redundant. I think this stems from trying to describe the elephant from eight different angles. No matter how many ways you look at it, the elephant is still an elephant. Much of what Benfari writes about already appears in many management theory and pop psychology books. The value of this book is precisely in the \\"multiple views\\" packaging Benfari gives the material.<br />&quot;Understanding and Changing Your Management Style&quot; is more of a workbook than a textbook. Don't just read this book. Have a pen handy and be ready to flip back-and-forth between the section you're reading and the appendices in the back. The last chapter was a bit of a let down for me. Rather than \\"developing an action plan,\\" it amounted to little more than re-recording the results of the assessments.<br />Nevertheless, if you're interested in developing yourself and your management skills, &quot;Understanding and Changing Your Management Style&quot; may be a useful book to have in your library.<br />The table of contents for this book is:<br />Introduction: What Makes a Good Manager?<br />Part One: A Model for Change<br />1 The Dynamics of Management Styles: What Can Be Changed?<br />2 Personality and Psychology: What's Your Type?<br />3 Practical Intelligence: How Do We Make It Work?<br />4 Mental Models: How Do We Make the Shift?<br />Part Two: The Elements of Management Style<br />5 Needs: The Drive Towards Competence<br />6 Power Bases: Influence, Authority, and Expertise<br />7 Problem Solving and Conflict Management: Catalysts for Change<br />8 Values: Clarifying What You Stand For<br />9 Stress: Managing Work and Difficult People<br />10 Putting It All Together: Developing an Action Plan for Your Management Stylelogy books.

As a development officer for a prep school, I was looking for a book that would give me a birds-eye view of issues involved with estate planning. Steve Maples The Complete Idiots Guide to Wills and Estates does this masterfully. And, to my relief, in plain English. Impressive for an attorney thats taught and practiced for the over 25 years!<br />In very easy-to-read language, Maple thoroughly lays out the whole terrain of estate planningfrom having a will to ways to save on current taxes and issues to consider in caring for aging parents. Going beyond mere explanation, hes packed this book with helpful forms and lists to get the reader started in their own estate planning. I picked up this book to help me with my conversations with donors but I ended up sitting down with an attorney to work on my own plan!<br />Maple groups his 24 chapters into five sections:<br />Part 1: Assets, Assets, Assets<br />Part 2: About Wills, Trusts. . . and Probate<br />Part 3: All in the Familyand Just a Little Beyond<br />Part 4: Taxes You Must Pay, and Those Maybe You Dont<br />Part 5: Retirement, Elder Issues, and the Broad Planning Picture<br />The structure of The Complete Idiots Guide to Wills and Estates makes it a great book for busy professionals. Its very easy to read in short chunks of time. And its not just for the beginner. Although its now somewhat dated, Maple gives some pretty technical examinations of taxes and IRS regulations. For readers that way find themselves losing interest during the dryer technical sections there are tips, quotes, and anecdotal information interspersed throughout. As a development professional, I was particularly glad for Chapter 18 How Charitable Donations Can Save You Money. Im trying to figure out how I could make this chapter required reading for prospective donors.<br />More than any planned giving seminar Ive attended, and for a lot less money, The Complete Idiots Guide to Wills and Estates has helped me see estate planning from the donors perspective.

This book is simply incredible. God used it powerfully in my life!	2001-05-15

I approached this book hesitantly, both because I was wary of its fad-like appeal and worried I'd find a &quot;blab-it, grab-it&quot; type of spirituality. It's neither. Wilkinson's work is an inspiring reminder that we serve a BIG God and our prayers ought to be big too. He clearly states that God's in control of answering prayer.<br />Other reviewers object to Wilkinson's not offering a thorough analysis of prayer, but he never promised to. As the title of the book indicates, this book is about the prayer of Jabez. It's a quick read and a terrific challenge.	2001-04-23

It's been fascinating to see him appreciate new things in the pictures and to be able to identify some of the foods the catepillar eats.<br />As a parent, it's refreshing to actually have a story line in a kids book. The repitition of the foods eaten each day, and the lesson in counting and days of the week it provides, makes it fun for all of us to read. And yes, the pictures are wonderful!	2001-04-03

Blanchard and O'Connor tell a great story about significant change in the life of the main character and his company. Some may criticize this as &quot;pop&quot; business theory or fluff but I sensed they were writing from personal experience. I especially love that they stress the fact it'll take 2-3 years to begin to see results.<br />If you're interested in organizing your life around shared values, check this book out. The book won't cost you much in money or reading time but you will probably glean some very helpful insights into the change process.	2001-04-03

This audio collection is a repackaging of Herriot's Cat Stories, Dog Stories, and Animal Stories. I've never listened to any of Herriot's work (or read any for that matter!)--these stories are terrific. They remind me of Miss Read. This is another great addition to your &quot;car trip&quot; audio book collection!	2001-03-07

Hunter gives a very interesting account of Celtic Christianity and how Celtic principles can positively shape modern day &quot;church.&quot;<br />I highly recommend this book. It's a great primer for those with little knowledge of the Celts or of church history. But it also has great insights for those that know lots about both.	2001-02-15

I first read this book in college with my fellow resident assistants. I've also read it many times since then. &quot;In the Name of Jesus&quot; is short and challenging.

Credibility is a terrific follow-up to Kouzes and Posners previous book.

The book is somewhat repetitive--but that could be to drive his point home. I think Long's work is a good introduction to Gen X and, more importantly, to the church's adapting to postmodernity.<br />Long's experience in campus ministry is extremely evident and lends credibility to his recommendations for ministry changes by the church. I especially appreciate his seeing my generation as one VERY ripe for revival. I heartily agree!	2000-12-12

Coates obviously has been (and is being) used by God. Having my feet firmly planted in both the sacramental and charismatic Christian traditions, I found it pretty one-sided.<br />If you're looking for more reasons why low-church is good, or if you've never considered how much of your faith is a relationship with Jesus vs. a relationship with church traditions, this may be a good book for you.	2000-12-10

Sure, the medieval imagery, symbols, and style of writing take a little getting used to--but her intense desire for intimacy with her Lord is inspiring.<br />As a devout (mostly Protestant) Christian, I highly recommend this work. Read it and you'll understand why people have been drawn closer to Him through Julian's writing.	2000-12-06

His humor and attitude is great--as is his advocacy for fathers to be involved.<br />I found the charts and index helpful when my wife and I had questions. I also liked the list of recommended kids books. Honestly, you can read a few months together and be fine. It's just nice knowing it's available on the bed stand, in case you need it!	2000-12-04

If anyone's earned the right to be heard, it's Bonhoeffer. I've read this book twice now and it's better the second time. This would be a great book to read as a married couple or a family. Bonhoeffer writes about living in community from both his own experience and from an incredibly biblical perspective. And, typical of his writing, you'll probably have to stop after a page or two to absorb all the truth he packs into each line!	2000-12-04

We've read all four out loud to each other and love them. This book is definitely setting the stage for the next three. I can't wait to see where Rowling takes it!<br />We're both Christians who take our faith very seriously. The whole &quot;witch&quot; thing did slow us down from reading these books but now that we are--we love them! It's funny, witches and warlocks in the writings of Tolkein or C.S. Lewis never bothered me. I'm not sure why they did here. I'm glad I got over it! Rowlings books are definitely worth reading.	2000-11-29

(I kept wondering what someone would write about Cantor in a few decades! *grin*) He obviously interacted personally with many of these &quot;greats.&quot;<br />I'm not sure if I learned more about the Middle Ages or the twentieth century but I know I learned alot about both.

He's obviously passionate about helping leaders cooperate with God's sculpting process. His six &quot;subplots&quot; of a leader's life are well explained and challenging. His insights into the lives of Moses, David, Paul, and Jesus were amazing.<br />I started reading this in a small group.
