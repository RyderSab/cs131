Eventho I'm no longer a believer, I purchased and read Pelikan's \\"Whose Bible Is It?\\" in order to understand how Scripture, which many still revere as the revealed word of God,  was compiled, translated and generally modified thru-out its three millennia life. And I wasn't disappointed. Pelikan does an excellent job of tracing the Bible's long history objectively, eventho he's clearly a believer. I'd rate his book five stars except for the inexcusable omission of an index (altho Amazon's `Search Inside' provides a substitute). I also found amusing his habit of making a strong statement then immediately qualify it.<br /><br />The Bible authors believed that God &al. spoke directly to them - at least that's what their inspirations seemed like - that the words came thru them, not from them. Yet musicians, artists, writers, scientists, mathematicians &al. also report similar inspirations from their unconscious. So why not now attribute the Bible authors' inspirations to the same unconscious source? Given what they knew back then about the world and our mind, it's understandable that they misattributed their inspirations to a supernatural rather than a natural source. But why continue now to perpetuate that illusion? In my book, \\"Concepts: A ProtoTheist Quest for Science-Minded Skeptics\\" I explore such questions and propose alternative explanations.	2005-09-15

In MacCulloch's \\"The Reformation\\", his latest of several books dealing with 1400-1700s Europe, he thoroughly explores all the issues and characters involved in the reforming of western Christianity. However he seems to assume the reader is familiar with that period, which I was not. Still, I was enlightened by many of his anecdotes and trivia, eventho I found his amount of detail somewhat overwhelming, and his geographic and chronologic jumping around sometimes hard to follow (he helpfully references other relevant pages elsewhere in the book). Even so I was able to glean from it what I wanted.<br /><br />I wanted to see if there are any lessons from the Reformation that might be applicable to a modern-day reformation of religious beliefs - a cultural shift from belief in God, saints, angels and devils `out there', to belief in whatever it is deep in our human nature that makes us susceptible to those obsolete beliefs. In my book \\"Concepts: A ProtoTheist Quest for Science-Minded Skeptics\\" I propose an explanation for the origin, dynamics and persistence of religious beliefs - a science of religion. I believe that eventually a modern-day reformation will displace obsolete beliefs; thus understanding the Reformation could be essential to navigating the transition.<br /><br />What I found striking was the almost universal conviction on all sides back then of the existence of God, the afterworld and the imminent apocalypse. As an alternative to their reliance on scripture and the classics, science was only beginning to emerge as a `heretical' way of knowing. Today science is gradually eclipsing religious beliefs, at least for most educated thinkers.  Yet Fundamentalists still cling to those archaic beliefs - they discredit science yet see no contradiction in benefiting from applied science such as in medicine, electronics and transportation - and they arrogantly want to impose those archaic beliefs on the rest of us (as did the competing sects during the Reformation).<br /><br />Of course the 1500-1600s Reformation wasn't the first; Constantine's conversion of the Roman Empire in the 300s from Paganism to Christianity wasn't either. What we can learn from these historic reformations is that, altho' the roots can germinate for years, given the right circumstances, the inception can be precipitous and then take a couple bloody centuries to workout stable and enduring forms. And of course politics plays a pivotal role. In the coming reformation, how can we avoid the blood and smooth the transition?  \\"Those who fail to learn from history are doomed to repeat it.\\" If this question intrigues you, have a look at both MacCulloch's and my books.he 1500-1600s Reformation wasn't the first; Constantine's conversion of the Roman Empire in the 300s from Paganism to Christianity wasn't either.

But mostly I found the book interesting for its history of science and the resistance, even hostility, to new ideas; specifically the `Copernican heresy' for which (in part) Giordano Bruno was burned at the stake in 1600 and in 1632 Galileo was put under house arrest for life. Indeed prudently, Copernicus published his \\"De revolutionibus\\" while on his deathbed beyond the reach of the Inquisition. Gingerich managed to locate 501 copies of the 1543 and 1566 editions (and about a hundred of the 1617 edition) of \\"De revolutionibus\\" carefully scrutinizing the annotations in all of them. He found copies that had been owned by Tyco Brahe, Kepler, Bruno, Galileo and others involved in overturning Ptolemy's deeply ingrained view of the Universe.<br /><br />Deeply ingrained concepts aren't easily overturned. In my book \\"Concepts: A ProtoTheist Quest for Science-Minded Skeptics\\" on pages 34, 41-2, 183, 249 and 279, I draw an analogy between the tenacity back then of the concept of the Earth as the center of the Universe and now the concept of God as the creator and ruler of the Universe.	2005-06-08

His explanation is based on the development of the human infant's brain. I'll condense his explanation into my own words.<br /><br />An infant's neocortex has billions of `seedling' neurons searching for stimuli which shape the way these neurons grow; the way its brain get `wired'. And the way the neurons grow conditions their response to future stimuli. The infant's initial experiences are with its caregivers (usually its mother). Initially the infant doesn't distinguish between itself and its caregiver; to it they're one omnipotent organism. The nurturing, warmth and comforting it receives in response to its whimpers and cries are seemingly self-induced -- the neurons in its neocortex initially get `wired' so that the infant unconsciously believes it induces it own nurturing.<br /><br />As the infant grows it learns to distinguish itself from its caregivers. But the early `wiring' is still in its brain available to be re-stimulated eventho' new patterns continue to be laid down along with the initial `wiring'. Until the child reaches its third year, it has no conscious memory (infantile amnesia). But the unconscious memories are still there in its brain available to be re-stimulated. As the child separates itself from its caregivers, it may compensate with an imaginary companion (such as a doll or blanket) that it can turn to for comfort.<br /><br />If at this age the child is taught about supernatural companions -- its putative Father in Heaven, Baby Jesus, Mother Mary and/or Guardian Angel -- these can re-stimulate its brain's initial `wiring' to unconsciously resonate with the child's infantile desires.  It can self-induce its own comforting unbeknown to its conscious mind which believes the projected comforting is coming from a supernatural entity Who seems very real. And thru-out its life, the person can induce comforting by praying to its imagined omnipotent `caregiver'. Faber does a much better job of explaining and documenting all this, so if my description stirs your interest, get Faber's new book. He shows the dire consequences of subjecting children to religious stories.<br /><br />However what Faber doesn't explain is how some of us managed to escape the influence of our brain's early `wiring' so that we're no longer (or never were) religious. We can't all have had bad mothering so that our infant brain never got thus `wired', and many of us were subjected to early religious indoctrination. Faber briefly raised and answers the question on page 34 (\\"... other neural connections arise as we mature ...\\") and on pages 43, 103 (\\"moving on\\") and 121. But he alludes to what I believe is a better explanation when he says on page 215 \\"... the unconscious is working to locate for us sources of attachment and security as we undertake our separate, dangerous journeys through the world.\\" I believe there's a rudimentary Urge to Life in us humans (and in all organisms) which propels growth and maturation to \\"undertake our journeys in the world.\\" We may sometimes grow weary and seek respite, but a healthy person is in touch with their Life Urge and tries to eschew infantile regression. Even so there's still another hazard that the person disown their Life Urge and instead project it out onto an imagined 'god'. If these ideas intrigue you, take a look at Amazon's detail pages on my book \\"Concepts: A ProtoTheist Quest for Science-Minded Skeptics.\\"<br /><br />Nonetheless I highly recommend Faber's book. He helped me better understand why religious beliefs are so common and persistent. Be forewarned tho' - I found myself getting impatient with his writing style. As a professor of English apparently he enjoys finding just the right words and using all of them, saying the same thing several ways. Moreover he's not adverse to long sentences and long paragraphs. And he skillfully strings together series of quotes into well constructed sentences. So rather than get impatient, I slowed down and tried to savor his writing.rings together series of quotes into well constructed sentences.

But perhaps `understand' is not an appropriate word for a postmodern work; `interpret' would be better since they hold that \\"there are no facts, only interpretations\\" (p.52, quoting Nietzsche), that everything is subjective as interpreted by whoever is doing the experiencing and that knowledge is arrived at thru inter-subjective dialog. True to form, they respect one another's points of view eventho' Vattimo is a devout (tho' not uncritical) Catholic whereas Rorty has called himself an atheist (altho' now he prefers `anti-clericalist'). Both seem to reject supernatural powers (altho' Vattimo speaks of salvation), referring to our age as post-metaphysical.<br /><br />I agree that everyone's entitled to their own opinion but only if they've done their homework (to quote Harry T. Cook), only if they've endeavored to first get the `facts'; otherwise a dialog among such folks is only pooled ignorance. But even if they've done their homework, postmodernists seem attuned more to history than to scientific explanations (episodic thinking rather than paradigmatic thinking, in Merlin Donald's terminology). Indeed these postmodernists speak of `historicity' and `anti-essentialism'. Certainly, our brain/mind must interpret (mostly pre-consciously) the sense data coming into it, using clues from others, in order to guess what's outside of us. Even so, most of our guesses are pretty good else we'd never survive in this world. Denying that there's any objective reality seems absurd. Admittedly our ancestors have made some bad guesses, such as believing in a flat-earth or in gods, but in recent times science has imposed burdens of proof.<br /><br />So I can recommend this book if you want to see where postmoderns are coming from and where they think religion is going -- they have some intriguing ideas. But if you're receptive to the explanatory ability of science, I'd suggest Pascal Boyer's \\"Religion Explained,\\" Dean Hamer's \\"The God Gene,\\" Sam Harris' \\"The End of Faith,\\" M.D. Faber's \\"The Psychological Roots of Religious Belief\\" and/or my book.nt times science has imposed burdens of proof.

Yet while he admirably provides the political and religious context in which their thinking developed, he doesn't provide the scientific and technological context. Consider the following.<br /><br />In those days most folks accepted the Biblical explanations of the Earth's and Life's beginnings - that the Earth was only a few thousand years old and unchanged (except for the Deluge's scares), and that the animal kingdom and humans were still much as God had created them. Scotland's James Hutton's arguments for Earth's `incalculable' age wouldn't be accepted until forty-years later when Charles Lyell published his own findings in 1830. Charles Darwin took a copy of Lyell's first volume on his famous voyage; it rattled Darwin's religious beliefs and eventually led in 1859 to his seminal \\"On the Origin of Species.\\" So eventho' several key founding fathers were Deists, given their limited knowledge, the best they were able to do was use words like \\"nature's God\\" and \\"endowed by their Creator.\\" What words might they have used instead, if they'd known then what we know now? Thus verbatim excerpts should be read in context.<br /><br />Moreover their technology was primitive by today's standards. They didn't have central heating but used fireplaces in many rooms (altho' Ben Franklin's stove-insert was coming into use). They didn't have indoor plumbing but used streams, wells, cisterns, buckets and pitchers, and outhouses and chamber pots. No electric lights or even gaslight, they used candles and oil lamps. They traveled by foot, theirs or horses' and oxen's. No telegraph much less telephone, radio, TV or email. You get the picture. Given their rudimentary technology, what they achieved was not only revolutionary but remarkable.<br /><br />So pick-up and peruse Church's little book, but put it in context. And if you're interested in an up-to-date scientific look at religion, you might also take a look at Amazon's detail pages on my book, \\"Concepts: A ProtoTheist Quest for Science-Minded Skeptics.\\"kable.  <br /> <br />So pick-up and peruse Church's little book, but put it in context.

Spiders' organisms co-evolved along with their webs, one just as important as the other, as a kind of hybrid. So too our organism co-evolved along with our culture; `culture' defined, not only as language, music &c, but as tools (clothing, shelter, weapons and other artifacts) and social institutions. So we need to view human evolution as a hybrid, not just in our organism but also in our culture, which now is `evolving' at an accelerating rate in runaway materialism. But whereas spiders and their webs evolved by random variation, we largely `invent' the variations in our culture. Thus we're now more or less in charge of our evolution; evolution is no longer `blind', we can be evolution's `eyes'.  We now have the potential to direct evolution's trajectory.<br /><br />Richerson & Boyd in their \\"Not by Genes Alone\\" use a narrower definition of culture: \\"Culture is information capable of affecting individuals' behavior that they acquire from other members of their species through teaching, imitation, and other forms of social transmission.\\" (p.5) \\"Culture is ... stored and manipulated in human brains.\\" (p.7) Eventho later they use the caption \\"Technology is culture, not environment\\" (p.29) their principal focus is on the social aspects of culture. Their thesis is that genes and culture co-evolve. \\"In the short run, cultural evolution, partly driven by ancient and tribal social instincts [in genes] and partly by selection among culturally variable groups, gave rise to the institutions we observe. In the longer run, cultural evolutionary processes create an environment that led to the evolution of uniquely human social instincts [in genes].\\" (p.235)<br /><br />But Richerson & Boyd seem to largely ignore the technical aspects of our culture which today are evolving at an accelerating rate much faster than, and driving the evolution of, the social aspects. On the one hand, how do our Pleistocene instincts (genes) equip us to use artifacts such as cars, computers and cell-phones, and on the other hand, how can these artifacts lead to the evolution of new instincts (genes) in such a short evolutionary timescale? The first answer may be the plasticity of our neocortex, especially in youth. The second answer may come from future technology that will develop and install new genes in humans which equip us to better deal with our accelerating technology.<br /><br />Another quibble: Richerson & Boyd, as do many authors, explain altruism by kin-selection and reciprocity, but fail to credit the desire of some individuals to improve humans' understanding and circumstances. Yet they themselves in writing this book are advancing human understanding, perhaps to some extent for selfish reasons such as prestige &c, but also for altruist reasons having little to do with kin-selection and reciprocity, nor presumably with attracting mates.<br /><br />So \\"Not by Genes Alone\\" is worth reading to understand the co-evolution of genes and social culture, but doesn't provide much insight to help us direct the more crucial technical aspects of evolution's trajectory. We live in interesting times, perhaps on the cusp of a radical shift in our culture.se to the institutions we observe.

Repcheck is to be commended not only for attempting to give Hutton the recognition he deserves but for portraying the locale and culture of Hutton's time. I certainly agree with other reviewers' positive assessments and highly recommend it.<br /><br />Two things struck me while reading this book. Hutton's culture was essentially the same that America's founding fathers labored under with its Biblical beliefs both in the Earth's six-thousand year age and in a pre-Darwin stagnant creation. And they had only pre-Industrial Revolution technology. What our founding fathers were able to accomplish was truly remarkable and revolutionary.

Before reading Safranski's \\"Nietzsche\\" I had a very limited and distorted understanding of Nietzsche's philosophy based on exposure in my youth to both the Nazi's selective expropriation of Nietzsche's ideas and the Catholic Church's demonization of him. Having now read Safranski's philosophical biography, I still don't feel I have a good understanding. This admittedly is due in part to my limited formal education in philosophy. But it's also due I believe to the author's and translator's sometimes vague descriptions of Nietzsche's ideas, and/or to the vicissitudes of Nietzsche's troubled mind, in a culture more then a century removed from today's America.<br /><br />So if you're like me, you'll muddle thru this book, glossing over descriptions that seem unclear, perhaps impatient with Nietzsche's egotism. Safranski shows more sympathy and tolerance in presenting the growth and development of Nietzsche's sometimes conflicting ideas. And according to his Epilogue, after Nietzsche's death his ideas were selectively adapted, not only by the Nazis, but by his sister and others, each to suit their own agendas. Indeed the Translator's Preface begins by noting that \\"Each of us can discover a different Nietzsche to admire and/or detest.\\"<br /><br />What I found to admire was Nietzsche's struggle toward the end of the nineteenth century to transform his `Death of God' into a philosophy of Life. Then at the beginning of the twentieth century Henri Bergson adapted Nietzsche's ideas to formulate his now discredited concept of a  `Life Force'. And now with the benefit of another century of scientific knowledge, I've proposed the concept of a `Life Urge' in my book \\"Concepts: A ProtoTheist Quest for Science Minded-Skeptics\\". If you've an interest in the transition from belief in God to belief in Life, you might find both Safranski's book and mine worth exploring.	2004-12-27

His book joins a growing chorus of voices seeking natural alternatives to supernatural explanations, including Pascal Boyer's \\"Religion Explained,\\" Dean Hamer's \\"The God Gene\\" and my \\"Concepts: A ProtoTheist Quest for Science-Minded Skeptics.\\" Each of us proposes an explanation, based on evolution and neuroscience, of the two- to three-millennia old religious dogmas which were put forth back when most folks thought the Earth was flat and was controlled by gods.<br /><br />At first I was put-off by Jaacobi's didactic style until I considered that he was raised under totalitarian regimes. He equates early humans with bee clusters (as shown on his book's cover) protecting the 'queen' at all costs. Yet it's now believed that before the agricultural revolution ten-thousand years ago, early humans were egalitarian, as are aboriginal hunter-gatherer cultures today.<br /><br />What Jaacobi calls the 'religion instinct' I believe is a much broader human trait of which religion is only one factor. Early humans bonded as groups thru common language and gestures, reciprocal sharing, rhythmic chanting and dancing, mythology and rituals &c in order to integrate and mutually secure resources against predators and competing human groups. It's as if Jaacobi defines 'religion' in such a way so that he can then claim Nazism was a religion, which is understandable given his background. For example he claims all religions have a congregation, which is generally true but not necessarily -- hermits have their solitary ways. Another claim is that all religions possess physical power which certainly was true in the expansion phases of Judaism, Christianity and Islam. But it's no longer true of most religions today. Yet many religions still possess influence -- `politically correct' influence to a greater or lesser degree -- which can be used by the `righteous' to curtail freedoms and if unchecked can lead to totalitarian regimes, whether religious or secular.<br /><br />So I applaud the marketing of Jaacobi's book not only to warn against the dangers of religion - as does Sam Harris' \\"The End of Faith\\" - but to propose a natural explanation for our susceptibility to religion.doms and if unchecked can lead to totalitarian regimes, whether religious or secular.  <br /> <br />So I applaud the marketing of Jaacobi's book not only to warn against the dangers of religion - as does Sam Harris' \\"The End of Faith\\" - but to propose a natural explanation for our susceptibility to religion.  <br />	2004-12-02

Kirsch's \\"God Against the Gods\\" is aptly subtitled -- intriguingly and entertainingly he traces the Western history of monotheism's struggles to replace polytheism, starting with Akhenaton all the way to Theodosius. He attempts to correct the distortions of Paganism perpetuated by the Judeo-Christian historians and he laments the lost riches of Greco-Roman culture destroyed by the Christian purges. He wonders what today's world might be like had not Julian foolishly gotten himself killed but had restored Paganism, and thus might have consigned Christianity to no more than a footnote in history. All in all, Kirsch's latest book is well worth reading.<br /><br />However I have a couple of concerns with Kirsch's perspective. I suggest that the difference between monotheism and polytheism wasn't that the monotheists believed in only one god. If we apply to Christianity the same definition of `gods' that the Greco-Romans used for all their greater and lesser gods, we'd have to include as `gods': God the Father, Son and Holy Ghost, Mother Mary, all the Apostles, all the saints, and all the angels and devils. (Just as Pagans looked to their patron god, Christians look to their patron saint or guardian angel, i.e. a `god'.) And the Jews not only have Yahweh but their many prophets, plus angels and devils. So the difference between mono- and polytheisms is not belief in just one `god' but rather in a strict hierarchy of `gods'. The Pagan gods were anarchist whereas the Judeo-Christian `gods' are all subordinate to one God. Which is just what the Roman emperors wanted in order to legitimize their power to control their vast empire, provided of course that the emperor could somehow utilize the authority of that God. By adopting and adapting `orthodox' Christianity to the Roman hierarchal system of government and culling the many other `heretical' sects, they hoped to save the Roman Empire. It didn't work, but it did secured the establishment of Christianity.<br /><br />Second and more important, it's time to trade-in the belief in `gods' for a more enlightened understanding of the origin and root of human's belief in `gods' by utilizing the knowledge that science has gained for us in just the past few centuries.

I read his book (hardcover) while researching my own book, \\"Concepts: A ProtoTheist Quest for Science-Minded Skeptics\\" and have since re-read it. He examines contemporary religious practices and beliefs -- both aboriginal and civilized -- from every conceivable perspective. He winnows the many usual explanations down to what he proposes as the correct explanation. In my book I propose an alternative explanation for `religion' by taking a more sweeping, narrative look at evolution's trajectory from the Big Bang to the emergence of human consciousness.<br /><br />While there are important differences in our views, nonetheless I applaud Boyer's adding his authoritative voice to the search for natural explanations of supernatural beliefs. Indeed he says \\"...what we call `belief' is very often an attempt to justify or explain intuitions...\\" Yet he doesn't deride believers, unlike Sam Harris in his \\"The End of Faith.\\" Boyer concludes that human minds have a variety of non-religious inference system onto which religious concepts can attach themselves, saying \\"religious concepts are parasitic\\"  (altho' he often uses `concept' where I'd use `percept'). Yet he doesn't attempt to explain how our brain produces our mind, as I do. His conclusions counter any idea of a `God gene'.<br /><br />If you have a taste for exhaustively reasoned logic, you'll enjoy Boyer.	2004-11-13

I was there early this year overseeing the design and printing of my book, \\"Concepts: A ProtoTheist Quest for Science-Minded Skeptics.\\" They gave me a copy of Robinson's book which I read and then gave to a friend (who's run more than thirty marathons) to read and pass on to others in our running group (tho' she still has it). Then I found myself wanting to refer to it so I purchased another copy for myself from Amazon.<br /><br />I particularly like Robinson's explanation and rendition of Robert Browning's poem \\"Pheidippides.\\" It inspired the inclusion of the marathon in the first modern Olympics which led to marathon races thru-out the world ever since. I also like Robinson's description of Alan Sillitoe's \\"The Loneliness of the Long-Distance Runner.\\" And many, many others. If you've done some long-distance running and have a taste for literature, you'll treasure this collection that Robinson's put-together.	2004-11-04

Its history of American freethinkers is informative, entertaining and comprehensive -- from the founding fathers, inspired by the Enlightenment but before Darwin or the industrial revolution, on thru the next two centuries of our nation's adolescence and into its maturity. Eventho' freethinkers gave us our `God-less' Constitution and eventually helped win equality for African-Americans and women, and freethinking scientists eroded many of theism's tenets; yet freethinkers (especially agnostics and atheists) are scorned by many Americans who instead still defer to theistic beliefs. Why?<br /><br />One reason, I suspect, may be that a plausible explanation of human's theistic predisposition has not been put forth -- which is what I attempt to do in my new book \\"Concepts: A ProtoTheist Quest for Science-Minded Skeptics.\\" Rather than deride theistic beliefs, as some freethinkers do, I try to take a positive approach in order to examine why and how theism originated, and discover what it is in human nature that enables theism to still persist in spite of its apparent obsolescence. I attempt to explain theistic beliefs' origins and roots in human nature based on the knowledge science has gained in just the past few centuries. Prototheism attempts to replace the obsolete theistic explanations put forth back when most folks thought the Earth was flat and was controlled by the gods.<br /><br />Jacoby's book traces our nation's long struggle between theists and freethinkers. Might an understanding of theism's origin and roots - prototheism - enable both to come closer together? Fifty years ago theists took the phrase \\"one nation indivisible\\" in our Pledge to the Flag and wedged \\"under God\\" between \\"one nation\\" and \\"indivisible\\" thus further dividing our one nation into two camps: theists and non-theists. It's my hope that an understanding of theism's origins might begin to lessen the antagonism and heal that wound.wound.  <br />	2004-10-28

Indeed Hayden has packed his big book with information, both text and graphics. So think of it as `three books in one' and its price won't seem so `outrageous'.<br /><br />Hayden explores how the adoption of religions was propelled by `politics' not only among the early egalitarian hunter-gatherers but especially the later hierarchical societies right on up to the present time. He's organized his book so the reader can sample as much or as little information as desired, by providing subject captions as well as summaries at the ends of the chapters. His descriptions are well written and personable, and fully referenced.<br /><br />What I didn't find adequately explained is why we humans are susceptible to belief in gods, which I explore in my book, \\"Concepts: A ProtoTheist Quest for Science-Minded Skeptics.\\"	2004-09-29

He not only castigates extremists but moderates who tolerate the beliefs that motivate extremists. He gives voice to the exasperation some folks harbor toward religion and perhaps provides the catharsis necessary to just get over it and move on.<br /><br />  After all, Judaism, Christianity and Islam were established when most folks thought the world was flat and was controlled by the gods. Back then they didn't have the knowledge of our world that science has gained for us in just the past few centuries. Given what they knew then, those religions may have been an improvement over what came before (altho' politics played a role in the establishment of all three). But that was then and this is now, so let's move on.<br /><br />  Move on to what? Perhaps folks are not moving because they don't know what to move toward. That's what I propose in my book, \\"Concepts: A ProtoTheist Quest for Science-Minded Skeptics.\\" While acknowledging the negatives in religion, I try to take a positive approach in order to examine why and how theism originated, and discover what it is in human nature that enables theism to still persist in spite of its obvious obsolescence.	2004-09-25

He describes in appalling detail the mis-treatments inflicted on patients by `doctors' back then. He similarly describes the dissection of cadavers that eventually led to a better understanding of the human body's functioning and its diseases.<br /><br />What struck me was the parallel between the paradigm shift back then in medicine from concepts based on philosophy and theology, to concepts based on observation and science; and the paradigm shift going on today in `religion' from concepts based on the supernatural, to concepts based on nature and science. If you have an interested in this latter paradigm shift, you might explore my book, \\"Concepts: A ProtoTheist Quest for Science-Minded Skeptics.\\"	2004-08-12

I read it after I'd written my book, \\"Concept: A ProtoTheist Quest for Science-Minded Skeptics\\", else I might have used some of his ideas in my chapters eight and nine (I do reference two of his earlier books). He elaborates and illustrates many of the concepts (tho' sometimes he uses `concept' were I'd use `percept'). However he largely ignores the functions of the pre-, sub- and un-conscious, yet speculates on \\"The Future of the Augmented Mind.\\" Also, while he mentions on pages 171-2 \\"the evolutionary trajectory we've been on,\\" he doesn't elaborate (as I do in chapter eleven) and thus has difficulty sustaining his optimism about our future.	2004-08-02

In my book's Chapter Nine I used a metaphor to describe this evolutionary process.<br /><br />That was before Edelman published his current book. Even so after all that, I still found his new book tough going. Somehow I have trouble with his style and terms. Nonetheless it's well worthwhile struggling with because he provides valuable information and insights.	2004-07-18

Seeing the recent movie \\"Troy\\" (twice) sparked my reading Homer's \\"Iliad\\" and \\"Odyssey\\" (Lombardo's translation). But Homer left gaps, assuming his audience was familiar with the mythology. Buxton's book very nicely, comprehensively and entertainingly fills in those gaps. It's fun to read or just peruse by itself, or as a reference.<br /><br />Even so I'm struck by the early Greeks' absolute belief in the gods, in the gods' presence, and in their power over men and events. Given those Greeks' knowledge of their world back then, I suppose such beliefs were to be expected. But we've come a long way in the intervening three millennia - still many today profess belief in God, the angels and saints. Based on what's known today about our world, in my book, \\"Concepts: A ProtoTheist Quest for Science-Minded Skeptics\\", I propose an alternative to such beliefs.	2004-07-16

I have the 1990 edition which is 491 pages including his 1990 'Afterword' 22 page update. When I saw that Mariner's 2000 edition is 512 pages I assumed Jaynes had again updated and expanded his 'Afterword' to cover developments in the past decade. Wrong! It's identical to the 1990 edition but they count every single piece of paper between the covers including blanks. So if you have the 1990 don't buy the 2000. But if you don't, then buy it.

McCrone provided the perspective I needed to begin pulling it all together. All these authors are attempting to apply evolutionary processes to explain the workings of our human brain; not so much how the brain evolved but how it continues to use evolutionary process in its workings. Unlike the others McCrone is not a scientist but a science writer and a good one: he gives just enough background on the various discoveries and theories, and explains how the various brain components work individually and together. My only quibble is that his book has only a few drawings of the brain so I had to refer to others to better visualize the components he describes. Read McCrone before tackling the others.	2001-06-14

Then a stranger came to the village, asked for a pancake and said  it was very good, but... Perplexed she made another and got a  similar  response. Then another and another until the man had had his fill and  finally said that that last one was a perfect pancake. So she could finally  stop. Our youngest daughter claims that when we made her we could finally  stop because she was the 'perfect pancake.' She's now 35 and teaches  school. She has many children's books but not this one.

He said that the Earth turned and that as it turned it circled the Sun (Copernicus'  `heresy'). He also said that the Universe was infinite with many peopled  worlds etc. His ideas threatened the Church then. Now we know that some of  his ideas were true. Bruno was a martyr for truth, and for freedom of  thought and expression. Though flawed and difficult, he was a man ahead of  his time who paid dearly for rights we take for granted. We should remember  and honor him in this anniversary year. A good start would be to read  Yanow's excellent historic novel about Bruno: The Nolan:... It's thoroughly  researched, well written and a good story. I've just finished it and highly  recommend it.	2000-02-09
