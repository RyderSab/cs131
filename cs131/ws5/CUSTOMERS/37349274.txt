I am not an advocate of the format this book takes, i.e. switching between the present day and then back several hundred years. This style has a tendency to make the story disjointed to say the least. However in this particular book it seemed to work quite well and I cannot think of any other way the story could have been told.<br /><br />The book begins on July 4 2005 at an archaeological dig in the mountains in  South Western France. Alice a volunteer at the dig has decided to do a little work away from the other members of the dig. She finds something (either by chance or destiny) that will change her life and the lives of many of the people around her. She has unearthed a time bomb that has been ticking away for centuries. . .<br /><br />This book is a unique twist on the much told tale of the Grail and to go too deeply into the plot would be to spoil the book for the reader. As I have said the plot twists and turns, backwards and forwards through the centuries. It involves a family in the early 13th century, who have been given the task of helping to protect ancient books and symbols that will allow the grail to be used, for good or evil.<br /><br />There are people  in the 21st. Century that are drawn back into the past by blood ties with the Pelletier family. They become involved in a sequence of events that they have no control over and become inextricably tied up with the fate of the Cathars 800 years ago.<br /><br />I enjoyed this book immensely. It was totally unlike anything I had read about the subject before.	2005-10-03

These events took place regularly, but not always with the blessing of the King (Richard the Lionheart) and other later Kings, who quite rightly thought that a large gathering of heavily armed men was not always conducive the their own health and their grip on the throne. <br /> <br />Crowner John is called from the inauguration of the new sheriff  and preparations for the tournament that is about to take place to an unidentified body. The death is not accidental, but a brutal murder and Sir John has to start tracking down who the man is before he can set about finding his killer or killers. <br /> <br />His inquiries lead him towards a well known family in the County the Peverals. Hugo who has already disgraced himself in the tournament is now head of the family after his father William was killed in somewhat strange circumstances at a tournament held earlier in the year. <br /> <br />Hugo has an older brother,  who has been overlooked as Lord of the Manor because of the falling  sickness, and Hugo has greedily taken the title. He also has two younger brothers, one of them Ralph is also well known on the tournament circuit. <br /> <br />The family do everything they can to block Sir John's inquiries and the relationship becomes so bad between them that it could have serious consequences for the Crowner . . .	2005-09-20

A man whose deeds were legendary and possibly only surpassed by the man he admired so much, Alexander the Great. <br /> <br />The Field of Swords deals with the period in his life when he had amassed his own legion the Tenth, comprising of men who thought of him as a God and were more than happy to follow him to hell and back. <br /> <br />Caesar take on the unenviable task of trying to quell the fearsome tribes of Gaul with his boyhood friend Brutus by his side. This campaign takes up the major part of the book and gives an insight into the problems Julius would have encountered with the war-like tribes he came across. The book ends with another sortie into  Britain. <br /> <br />While Caesar is away from Rome his old rival Pompey is making his own plans for immortality. The two men who have had an uneasy relationship are bound to have a confrontation in the near future, one that could be fatal . . .	2005-09-20

The Dean who has asked for help from Sir Baldwin in his capacity as Keeper of the King's Peace, sends a messenger to his manor requesting his help in solving the murder. <br /> <br />Sir Baldwin in turn sends to his friend Simon to come and assist him, particularly as he knows he would like a break from his new job, which Simon destests, but has not got the heart to tell his employer the Abbott. <br /> <br />Baldwin has hardly arrived in Exeter before another murder takes place. Slowly he begins to put together what happened forty years ago and the names of the people involved. Are the current murders connected with what happened so long ago . . . <br /> <br />I really enjoyed this one and think that Mr. Jecks is back to his best.	2005-08-23

Until a new governor is installed Marcus Septimus is one of the most important men in Roman Britain. He is also the patron of Libertus, one-time slave and mosaic (pavement maker) artist.

This is a tried and tested formula from the author. <br /> <br />Amelia Peabody and her famous Egyptologist husband Emmerson are back in Egypt for the start of the excavation season. Their son Ramses and his wife and the twins are of course with them. <br /> <br />They are called upon by a lady who gives Emmerson a golden statuette, saying that it is cursed and was the cause of her husband's death. She was Emmerson to lift the curse from the statue and of course this is where all the skulduggery and mayhem begin. <br /> <br />I was a little taken aback by several attacks on the character of Howard Carter, the man who found the tomb of Tutankhamun, although in recent years his \\"behaviour\\" has been brought into question. <br /> <br />Some people may find the authors style of writing tedious, but most people myself included find it amusing and easy reading.

He talks of battles and of his friends both from childhood and during his short  adult years. He tells of the relationship between his father and how the death of his father Philip of Macedon affected him. <br /> <br />Alexander held all his generals in great affection but particularly Hephaestion, his boyhood friend. This is clearly shown throughout the book. Each chapter of the book is devoted to a different event or person in Alexander's life. <br /> <br />Steven Pressfield stands alone in his ability to describe the battle scenes of  this period of history. He also has the ability to make Alexander come to life as a  person. Anyone who could really tell us what the man himself was like has long since turned to dust, but Pressfield gives us a plausible and believable character for the man. I really enjoyed the book but would not say it was a casual or easy read. <br /> <br />Much has been said about Alexander (the Great) conquering the world. It must be remembered that Alexander was just a man, albeit a powerful man and an astute battle tactician. However it is the soldiers of Alexander who won the victories. <br /> <br />His army was the most sophisticated, the best equipped and the largest that the Ancient World had ever seen. Put into context it was like the British Army fighting the Zulu nation. The Zulu won a few skirmishes, but Assagis against the Gattling gun and repeating rifle was never really going to be a contest. <br />	2005-03-31

Now I feel Mr. Pratchett has made a subtle change in his writing style to appeal to even more readers (if that is possible).    I believe that the large national organisations are probably quaking in their boots wondering if they are going to be the next subject he picks on. Will it be the Railways, Airlines or even the Government themselves. Perhaps Mr. Pratchett should be the Prime Minister, he certainly seems  in a humorous way (or is he serious), to be able to put his finger on the problems that abound in these national industries.    Perhaps a few old ladies in black pointed hats walking around Westminster and  a few Werewolves pounding the beat in police uniform would be of enormous benefit to the nation.    Going Postal is a joy to read. What an incentive for career criminal Moist von Ludwig. Put Ankh-Morpork's ailing postal service back on its feet or face being hanged. Perhaps that's the kind of incentive all bosses of national institutions should have (only joking, I think). It certainly makes the old grey cells start to tingle. Perhaps a criminal has the sort of devious mind that could turn things around    If you have read the others you will know what to expect.

This book is excellent and it is difficult to give a brief synopsis of it without giving too much of the plot away, but here goes. <br /> <br />The book begins in the late 9th century AD. The Vikings are seen in the coastal water of Northumbria. The news comes through to the Ealdorman of the major stronghold in  Northumbria that the Vikings have captured Eoferwic (York) and he marches with his army and his ten year old son to join forces with the other English forces to retake the city. <br /> <br />The battle is a resounding success for the Vikings and the young boy is captured and taken into the family of Ragnar one of the senior Vikings. Ragnar likes the boy  Uhtred and  treats him as his own son. <br /> <br />The struggle  between the English and the Danes and how the boy grows up not knowing where is true loyalties  lie is the background to the book. His eventual marriage moves him closer to the English cause, and when he is drawn into a battle against one of the greatest Viking chieftains he realises at last his true allegiance. <br /> <br />This really is a blood and  guts novel and a really good read.	2005-02-11

The first book was excellent, relating to the period of his boyhood, this one is just as good and I can't wait for the next.    At the start of the book the young Julius Caesar is on board a war galley, and he is gaining a fearsome reputation. Then the ship is captured and he is offered for ransom.    After gathering a force of men to defeat his captors as he had promised them he would, he returns to the city of Rome in triumph.    He then becomes embroiled in a new crisis that is threatening the city, an unknown but rebellious gladiator by the name of Spartacus.    These books take you into the streets of Rome and the minds of the people, as though you were there yourself.

Definitely	This is a tremendous book for anyone interested in the gladitorial contests of Ancient Rome. <br /> <br />The Romans used to treat the games as a holiday and they were so immune to the sight of death, and human life was held in such disregard that they would cheer and shout at the demise of a fallen warrior, just as modern day people would at the scoring of a goal at a football match. <br /> <br />The gladiators life was inevitably short and violent, but not all contests were fought to the death, it took a tremendous amount of time and money to train a fighter and their \\"managers\\" did not like to see their investment terminated. <br /> <br />Even free men chose to take of the life of a gladiator. They could gain great wealth if they were successful and were much beloved by many of the women of Rome. <br /> <br />There were many different types of gladiators, some using a short sword and shield, others a net and a trident. They are all named and described in the book. <br /> <br />Man was not always pitted against man, sometimes a gladiator would be paired against a wild animal or a pack of animals. <br /> <br />The book gives you a real feel of what it would really be like to stride out of the dark into the bright sunshine and burning sand of the arena. Possibly with a slave with a red hot iron egging you on if you were a bit hesitant, and the loser would certainly be marked with the hot iron to ensure that he was dead. <br />	2004-11-27

This is a book you can become engrossed in, and time passes all too quickly. <br />It takes place in 15th century Venice and this period is obviously very well researched. The plots and counter plots are so numerous that it would be impossible to try to put them down in this short synopsis. There are many emotions and events to think about within the book: Medicine, the effects of plague, prostitution, witchcraft, betrayal, loyalty. Within all this there is the momentous event of the setting up of the first printing press in Venice and the effects this has on the people of Venice. <br />My only criticism of the book and this happens with many books, there are too many characters for the reader to keep an accurate account of and I found myself back tracking frequently.	2004-11-24

Starting in 1156 the couple have been married for four years. The birth of their sons has ensured the succession to the throne, but civil war has seen the country torn apart.   Henry needs to defend the borders of England against France and Wales, but his most daunting task is his fight with the church to stop them from infringing on his power.  This fight culminates with his one time friend Thomas Becket, whom Henry has made Archbishop of Canterbury being murdered in Canterbury Cathedral.

However this is not so, what happens is that they come forward in time but only by a few hundred years to the time when the Romans have left Britain undefended and Arthur and is men are taking on the Saxons.

The plot of this book is built around a Leper Hospital and there is soon murder and mayhem for Sir Baldwin and Simon to deal with. The plots of these books run along at a fast pace and for those interested in the period of the 14th century in England are a joy to read.	2004-11-13

This book takes a serious look at the subject, sometimes from a different angle to the conventional academic theories, so far put forth. For anyone interested in the subject of Tutankhamen, or in Egyptology in general this book is a good read. If you do not agree with the theories put forth by the author so be it, but that is not a good reason for avoiding reading the book. Much of the ancient past is there to debate, because much of it is based on opinion, educated opinion yes, but after all none of us were there to confirm or deny it. This book stimulates the mind and that cannot be a bad thing.	2004-11-13

A body is found by a pack of fox hounds belonging to the constable of Warwick Castle. The body is that of a former member of the constable's household and Sir Henry the constable swears to find the killer. <br />By chance the Domesday Commissioners Ralph Delchard and Gervase Bret, have been sent to the Warwick area to adjudicate on some land disputes. They believe that a man arrested by Sir Henry seem to be an unlikely suspect. They believe that Sir Henry has jumped to the wrong conclusion, but they have little time to save the life of the suspect. <br />Edward Marston has a complete mastery of his craft and his plots are well thought out and all the more believable for that.

The Pharaoh is returning to Thebes after successfully doing battle with the sea raiders in the Nile Delta. However there are factions who are less than happy to seem him return. Reunited with his wife and people Tuthmosis celebrates his homecoming, but within an hour he is dead.

An Imperial order sends him and his girlfriend Helena Justina, the daughter of a Senator to the rose red city of Petra. There they discover a murdered playwright. <br />Falco feels obliged to investigate the murder and soon becomes embroiled in more murder and mayhem, making him wish he had not left his beloved Rome.

She is heavily involved with one of the foremost gladiators in the city and he has become the subject of a heavy betting syndicate who are attempting to manipulate his fights in the arena to their advantage. The book is full of the savagery and violence that is well documented for that period of history. Paul Doherty seems to be able to turn his hand to any period of history, be it Rome, Ancient Egypt or Medieval England. This is as good as any of his recent books.	2004-11-13

Five cathedrals have been built on the site that has seen violence, mystery and of course worship. To go too deeply into the plot would spoil the book for the potential reader.

Libertus the main character is a freedman, working as a Pavement maker  (Mosaic Artist) in Glevum (modern day Gloucester.) He has an influential Roman patron Marcus Septimus who calls on him frequently because of his ability to solve mysteries. These books differ from the Lindsey Davis and David Wishart books as Libertus is portrayed as a person attuned to his surroundings rather than with the manner of a New York cop. For those who have read the other books, this is just as good. Not much about the plot here, but why spoil it. Buy the book.	2004-11-13

It is summer 1323, Sir Baldwin and Simon are about to leave on a pilgrimage. They are going to travel across Europe to Santiago de Compostela. Foreign travel is dangerous even for well armed men, and attacks on pilgrims are common place, but an even greater menace hangs over the city of Santiago. <br />For those who have not ready any of Michael Jecks medieval novels I can recommend them heartily. This novel takes Simon and Sir Baldwin away from their West Country environment but loses nothing of its mystery and suspense. If you like medieval mysteries, these are as good as any around.	2004-11-12

The knight Edmund Strongfist is leaving for the Holy Land and Sabin leaves with him and his daughter. <br />Just a taste, read the rest yourself. <br />When I read Elizabeth Chadwick's books I always wonder as a man whether I really should be, as they could be construed as love stories.

The logistics of moving the stones and placing them in their correct positions is all there woven around a story of the people involved, but for me it just was not quite right.

For instance there is a chapter on micro-propagation, not something many hobbyist will become involved in, but very interesting never the less. There are articles on correct plant labelling and the reallocation of certain plants into different genera and the usual soil preparation, watering and general care requirements needed to keep the plants healthy. There is an excellent article which allows you to work out your own climate conditions, including a map of the different zones. The photographs are of very good quality and the descriptions of the plants themselves are clear and accurate.

If reviewers have panned this book in the past I cannot understand where they are coming from. The book contains easy to follow exercises that help you to create the effect you are looking for and encourages you to use your own initiative to take things that step further. Anyone with a modicum of computer expertise can vastly improve their digital photogaphs. Not everyone wants to become involved in using filters, layers and masks, but to just be able to sharpen, adjust contrast and brightness of photographs and do some colour corrections makes owning this book well worthwhile.

As a plant identifier it is excellent, with a strong emphasis on flowering plants, always a plus, but the book goes much further than just being a \\"photo album\\". The descriptions of plants are clear and concise, including the origin of the plant, its flowering period and average size. Also included is the spination pattern of the plant and a small synopsis on cultivation for each one, (I am not sure I always agree with the author on minimum temperatures, but so many other factors come into determining  this). There are articles on obtaining seed, sowing the seed, taking cuttings and grafting. This is another book that has decided to use symbols to denote flowering, amount of sun required, watering etc. All in all the books is very good and I recommend it to the cactus grower.	2004-10-29

Even in a book geared towards helping the less experienced grower, new things can be learned by the \\"so called experts.\\" There is a good though limited selection of plants and all the necessary information regarding their care and propagation. One minor irritation to me and not just aimed at this particular book, is why authors assume that their readership will automatically be interested in both true cacti and the other succulents and vice versa. They are I suppose trying to get two books into one and sometimes they fail on both counts.	2004-10-29

However I would like to point out to potential purchasers, if your interest lies in columnar cacti (Cereus, Cleistocactus, Pilosocereus, I know I could go on forever), or anthing from the Opuntia genus, you will be disappointed because they are not included in the book. Of course many other species are not included but this would be virtually impossible to achieve. There is a very good selection of species for all of the more popular genera, many in flower, which obviously aids in the identification process. As a plant identifier this book would be very difficult to beat. Plant care is virtually non existent, but this is not what the book is about. Under most photographs you will get details of the distribution of the plant; flower colour; spination and some of the different synonyms the plant may be labelled under. if you have any serious interest in Cacti you need this book.	2004-10-28

The author founded the famous Holly Gate Nursery in Sussex, England and has been quite a prolific author on the subject. His books are much sought after, but there are many more recent books on the subject and these will probably be more pleasing to the buyers eye. New printing techniques and improvements in photography have made the book look somewhat dated. Having said that the book is well written and provides lots of useful information.

Not Quite	To give this book the title \\"Ultimate\\" is stretching the point a little. The subject of cacti is far too vast for any book on the subject to call itself ultimate. OK they had to call it something.  On the serious side the book is excellently produced, well layed out and informative. The author knows his subject and presents it in an enjoyable and easily readable format. For those cactophiles who like their photographs, the ones in this book are hard to beat. The genera that are described in the book are described in some depth (not one species from each genus, a style I personally hate). There are symbols to tell you whether the plants are suitable for outdoors, greenhouse or windowsill. Each description of a species gives the natural habitat for the plant, average size the plant may attain and flower colour.  The Cacti and Succulents have separate sections (good idea), and there are chapters on grafting (excellent photographs); pests and diseases; seed sowing and soil mixtures etc.  Because the book covers both Cacti and Succulents, only the more popular species are catered for, but there are many specialist books on single genera for those who need them. After all a book is similar to a dog, a friend for life, and you can't have too many of those.  This book contains all the information any hobbyist would need to grow cacti successfully and to keep them looking healthy for many years to come. It's in my collection.  P.S. This book has appeared under several titles, so check before you buy, you may find you already own it.	2004-10-27

(well I had to borrow a review copy from an editor friend of mine, unfortunately he wanted it back). The author a Senior Research Botanist spent most of his lifetime amassing the information that forms this book and then sadly died only two weeks after publication. This is a book for the serious hobbyist. If you are looking for nice photographs of plants in pots, this is probably not the book for you. Having said that there are enough photographs in this book to satisfy even the most avid plant spotter (1016 colour plates.) \\"Is this plant an Acanthocalycium or an Echinopsis?\\" This book will give you the answer. In one form or another the book covers most of the Cactaceae family. It is certainly one of the first books to use the nomenclature of the IOS Consensus group. This is a big book 776 pages, \\"Some books are to be tasted, others to be swallowed and some few to be chewed and digested\\" Francis Bacon 1561-1625. This book certainly falls into the latter category and it is a great shame that the author is not with us to take the acclaim he surely deserved, but what a legacy he has left.

No book on cacti can give all the answers, the subject is too vast. The author of this book takes the sensible approach and ensures that the content is well written and informative. The photographs in the book are excellent and show some species that are not normally seen in this type of book, particulary the Asclepiadaceae family. The feeling that the author would like you the reader to know exactly what he knows comes through strongly. There are articles on pests and diseases, grafting, watering and soil mixtures and even some tips on showing your plants. For those people who have a small collection of plants and want to keep them healthy and flowering, without going into too many technicalities, this is the book for you, and excellent value too.	2004-10-27

The author is well known and respected in Cacti circles and the book reflects his knowledge and status. The first section relates to the history and discovery of cacti and shows some amazing photographs of cacti in their habitat. It goes on to show how best to display your cacti in suitable containers and then a chapter on the differing shapes of the plants and their flowers The plant catalogue itself does not show too many of the different genera, but the popular ones are there and what it does do is show photographs of a number of species within a certain genera and this appeals to me. Too many books try to over-reach themselves and try to cram in as many genera as possible, showing a photograph of one species and very short descriptions of one or two other species. In this book the descriptions of each plant give the average height, flower colour etc. and also the min. temp. each plant will stand. The book shares space equally between true cacti and succulents and they are presented separately which makes the book layout clean and easily readable. At the end of the book are several pages on plant selection in sections, i.e. Plants for beginners; Plants for the Greenhouse; Free Flowering plants etc. This is another plus. One criticism I have is that many of the plants are photographed from directly overhead, this may be aesthetically pleasing, but does not give a true reflection of the size and shape of the plant and is not really my cup of tea. But this is a small moan about what is otherwise an excellent book. At this price the book is a good buy and there is something for everyone interested in the care of these unusual plants. I am happy to have this book in my collection.	2004-10-27
