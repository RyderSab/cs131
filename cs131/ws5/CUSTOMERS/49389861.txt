This book is not your typical \\"self-help\\" \\"how to get rich quick\\" type of read. Rather it is a blueprint of how to add purpose, meaning, and direction to your life so that you might \\"get from where you are to where you want to be.\\"<br /><br />Ralph Waldo Emerson once said that the \\"masses of men lead lives of quiet despairation,\\" and it is because \\"where there is no vision, the people perish.\\" In order to experience success, one must understand the principles of success. In order to understand the principles of success, one must learn them from one who has experienced success, as well as failure.<br /><br />The appeal of this book is that it is simple, yet not simplistic; it is common-sense, yet not common, that is not trite. Jack Canfield draws from a diverse wellspring of sources, personal experiences, and knowledge basis to illustrate that whatever you define as success, if you the reader want to experience this success, you can. \\"The Principles always work, if you work the principles.\\"<br /><br />This book is not a book one will read, then go on ones merry way to live happily ever after. This book is more like a \\"pocket consultant;\\" I have found myself referring to various chapters in this book on an as needed basis and will continue to do so as the wisdom contained therin is truly timeless.<br /><br />Mr. Canfield has given humankind a gift and this book makes a great gift to oneself, or to anyone you feel could use affirmation.<br /><br />A truly life-impacting read in every sense of the word.	2005-07-19

How this debilitating illness ever became romaticiszed is beyond me. But no one who has ever suffered truly suffered from depression could ever look back with nostalgia on the experience. This is why Dr. Kramer's book resonates with such reason and common sense, if not humane-ness and compassion.  <br /> <br />We live in an age when it has become fashionable to be content with your suffering; to be the \\"walking wounded.\\" The gliteratti flaunt their pathology endlessly on the daytime talk shows without shame, and depression is the sickness of choice.  <br /> <br />But Peter Kramer has de-legitimized this romantic notion that somehow there is some virtue in suffering and debunks this myth and exposes depression for what it is; an insidious disease that sucks the life out of its victim and, if left untreated, robs the sufferer of his or her joy, health, spirituality, livlihood, friends, romances, family, and, ultimately life.  <br /> <br />This work is an important dialogue about an illness that has reached pandemic levels worldwide as a public health crisis. Depression is real, it is measurable, quantifiable, verifiable, and, thankfully, treatable.  <br /> <br />Dr. Kramer has performed a valuable public service with this work and clinician and consumer alike should read this book to understand this terrible maladay, especially if you are know or are living with someone who has been diagnosed with depression.	2005-06-17

Theodore Milon's work on personality disorder's is a tour de force of the little understood world of \\"personality disorders in modern life.\\"     This is an outstanding book, both as a text for the advanced master's level student, or as a stand-alone reference for the clinician looking to delve deeper into this mysterious world.     Dr. Milon cogently and meticulously dissects each disorder and provides case vignettes to aid the reader in grasping each entity for what it is, if that is possible.     Highly recommended.

Having been on \\"both sides of the couch\\" so to speak (I have been both a client and a therapist-in-training), i had a great deal of appreciation of this collection of vignettes from this great and gentle man, Dr. Yalom.  <br /> <br />Dr. Yalom writes from the heart; which is why I think you will find some of the reviewers offended. Too often the analyst/counselor/psychologist is the \\"idolized parent\\" is not supposed to have real/human feelings of his or her own, and Dr. Yalom's book (this and several others) show current and aspiring clinicians like myself that it is only natural and desirable to not only have these feelings, but to acknowledge them.  <br /> <br />The author writes with a familiar style that makes you feel as if you have been in analysis with him. I have learned a great deal about how to process my own cases (and my own therapy experiences) by reading this, as well as Dr. Yalom's latest work which is direct to therapists themselves.  <br /> <br />I am not sure this is a book I would recommend to someone who is not a mental health professional; nevertheless, it was food, and healing for my soul at a time when I needed to process some very signficant personal and professional issues that were overlapping.  <br /> <br />Thank you again, Dr. Yalom, for reminding me that nobodys like myself practice our great craft by standing on the shoulders on great men like yourself.	2005-05-10

Dr. Leahy has provided a first-class resource of techniques for the problem-solving oriented clinician to use.     This book is laid out in a logical format; you are shown the technique, the rationale, given clinical vignettes, possible obstacles, cross-references to other techniques to be used in conjunction or perhaps instead of a particular method, as well as a homework assignment for the client. This resource reflects the wisdom born out by many years of practice, as well as understanding how the mind thinks and operates; responses rooted in compassion and an empathy for the human condition.     Dr. Leahy focuses on concepts, from automatic thoughts to schema-focused therapy. This resource is necessary for the clinician not just because of the variety techniques, there are actual handouts for the therapist and the client to use.     I relied heavily on this book during my counseling internship as a go-to resource with very good results. I plan on using this book, as well as the others that Dr. Leahy has written, to inform my practice for many years to come. The homework assignments as well as the forms proved to be very practical and useful for the client.     This book is highly recommended for the novice as well as the veteran practioner alike. 5+ Stars. A must have for your professional library. I cannot recommend this book enough! It was so helpful!	2005-05-03

I can recall to this day the fire lit in my soul as the words written by the Word Himself seared into my very soul a new way of thinking, living, and being.    This little known exegete from Grosse Pointe, Michigan has spent three (3) years on a labor of love for the Body of Christ, under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit to give us this bread for the hungry soul; HEAR HIM! The One Hundred Twenty Five Commands Of Jesus.     The first portion of the book, before the commands, I would classify as a jeremiad. Nominal christendom has strayed so far away from the faith that was once delivered to the saints, she deserves the rebuke she so rightly receives, in love, from Pastor Wittstock as he quotes everyone from the early church fathers, right on down to John MacArthur.     This book isn't some half-cocked diatribe written by someone embittered by a critical spirit. It does not take you long to catch the Pastor's spirit of earnest and zeal for the children of God to be zealous and repent, to \\"HEAR HIM!\\" and return to the Word of God, and away from the commandments of men which have made His Word of none effect.     Each of the one hundred twenty five commands of Jesus Christ is set forth in an expository format, with corresponding scriptures for further study by the serious contender. This format makes this book ideal as a devotional book, which is how I have been recommending it to fellow church members and strangers alike.    The writing is cogent. This is not the type of book you will be able to just \\"fly through.\\" It is not your typical \\"pop Christian\\" sugar-coated book. It takes \\"eyes to see, and a heart to understand;\\" HEAR HIM! is the type of book where you may come across one command, read it and ruminate on the saying for the rest of your devotional time. It may take you awhile to getthrough this read, as it has me, so don't be surprised. In type, don't we take our time with a good, well prepared meal?     HEAR HIM! has blessed me in ways too numerous too mention in this short space; I've had dreams, people have seen me reading it, and have stopped and asked me to tell them about it. It has been a wonderful witnessing tool, one that has allowed me to tell others about the lateness of the times, and the condition of the world, and the soon coming of Jesus Christ.     This book is a must read. I would not just purchase one, but rather two, or three copies so that you can give them away and still retain a copy for yourself. I am recommending this fine work as a devotional book to everyone, and anyone I meet.	2005-03-18

This jeremiad is written primarily for parents and caregivers; yet it is apropos for anyone concerned for the state of the well-being of the American child today.  <br /> <br />Dr. Taylor's razor-sharp insightful book gives the reader an inside look at all of the influences that are on the offensive against anyone who is looking out for the welfare of our future; namely physically, emotionally, and psychologically healthy children.  <br /> <br />Point-by-searing-point he guides the reader down the rot that has eaten away at our society mores; from pop culture, to coroporate greed that finances everything from rot-gut music, to fashion that sexualizes children and fosters values that tells our kids that they \\"must have\\" everything in order to be happy, successful, fit in...you name it. <br /> <br />This book is a must have, must read for anyone raising a child, no matter what the age. Dr. Taylor is an important voice in the national dialogue on child-rearing that, after the publishing of this book, will have to be listened to.  <br /> <br />Buy this book today...in fact buy two and give a copy to a friend.

The former Speaker of the House is categorically one of the premier policy thinkers of our time but there is a huge difference from being able to think and being able to govern.  <br /> <br />This opus magnum is a worthy sequel to his To Renew America, to be sure, but what tarnishes this great work is the fact that much of what the former Speaker has to say is just that: what the Speaker has to say. He has no record to point to. He has never governed.  <br /> <br />This book is a great read for those of us who are amateur \\"policy wonks;\\" it is good dinner party conversation material, if you hang out with friends, liberal or conservative, who like to discuss ideas.  <br /> <br />As far as Newt Gingrich being a \\"major player\\" in the arena of ideas, history has passed him by. He had an opportunity to be the conservative answer to Tip O'Neill in the House, but for some reason, blew this opportunity. This is why his book rings hollow.	2005-02-22

This book is destined to be a primary work on the 9/11 tragedy simply because of its grand view,and compelling look at the dynmaic world scene.  <br /> <br />Thomas L. Friedman has written a book no other journalist or author could have written. In many ways this book is the logical extension of From Beirut to Jerusalem, and The Lexus and the Olive Tree because the themes, plots, and subplots are so intricately woven, and spun so tightly together as to be indistinguishable.  <br /> <br />The three can literally be taken as a trilogy because the Israeli-Paletinian conflict has riveted the nations of the world to the Middle East, globalization has exacerbated the tensions contained therin, and 9/11 gave vent to \\"super-empowered individuals\\" who started a whole new type of conflict, World War III, which involves the unresolved issues festering in the Arab street over Israel, what technology hath wrought, how the Arabs have not kept apace w/globalization. Friedman weaves a beautiful tapestry in Longitudes and Attitudes that will hold the reader spellbound.  <br /> <br />A highly recommended read that will help the reader keep abreast of a quickly changing world scene.	2005-02-22

Mr. Petro was on The O'Reilly Factor discussing his book, which whetted my appetite for this truly fascinating account of life inside \\"The Service.\\" <br /> <br />From the opening pages, this work is a dignified account of a solemn duty, and the reader can sense that Mr. Petro took his charge with the utmost of seriousness. There is not one ounce of sanctimony in his tenor. He considered each assignment a sacred duty to protect, whether they were friend (Ronald Reagan) or foe (Arafat), whether he agreed with them politically (Dan Quayle, or The Pope), or not.  <br /> <br />What I love about this book is that Joseph Petro does not spend close to 300 pages patting himself on the back, displaying faux modesty making statements such as \\"I don't consider myself a hero.\\" He's honest without being mawkishly sentimental (such as what one can see daily on Oprah). <br /> <br />A subplot to this book harkens the reader back to a time when our leaders displayed a respect for the office they held, and carried themselves with a dignity that was commensurate with that office. In picture after picture you see this dignity reflected in the posture and demeanor of Joe Petro.  <br /> <br />This book is not only a tribute to the many courageous men and women of The Secret Service, it is also a tribute to the fine American who shared his life as he stood next to history: Agent Joseph Petro.  <br />	2005-02-14

What maks Ann Coulter so fascinating to me is the wide range of visceral reactions she genrates, whether it be in person, i.e. being interviewed on t.v., or in forums such as this. No one is indifferent when it comes to her.  <br /> <br />For as far back as I can remember ( I am 44) the liberals have had virtual hegemony in the media, academia, entertainment, vitually all avenues of expression until Rush Limbaugh broke the choke-hold in 1988 opening the way for people like Ann, et. al. to come on the scene and present an alternative viewpoint. <br /> <br />The world has not been the same since, and the liberals have not recovered. <br /> <br />The pattern Ann puts forth in her book of how liberals meet disagreement or opposition of their point of view with violence, or disrespect (such as the case of the college liberals burning the campus Republican newspapers), even plays itself out in my daughter's 8th grade enrichment class. She has a \\"liberal\\" teacher who tries to propagandize the class with her viewpoints. If anyone disagrees with her, she admonishes them to \\"keep an open mind;\\" as if \\"keeping an open mind\\" means that you can only be open minded if you agree with me! What's with these liberals anyway?  <br /> <br />A treasure-trove compendium of her columns over the years unmasking the sophistry of the likes of the New York Times, the Democratic party, the French looking failed presidential candidate Jean Francios Kerry, and many, many more. <br /> <br />This bete-noir of the American left is a breath of fresh air with her incisive wit, biting satire, and merciless sarcasim. She takes no prisoners and makes no apoligies. Ann is a true patriot. A funny lady with a unique writing style that is sure to entertain as well as educate. A must read for all.	2004-12-27

After reading this book, for the 2nd or 3rd time, I can only say: \\"Where are the Tozer's today?\\"  <br /> <br />It is easy to see why this largely self-taught, prayerful man of God achieved so little fame during his lifetime; his message is the Gospel According to Jesus.  <br /> <br />Whether or not he may be aware of it, in Tozer's writings, you can see how he decreased that Christ would increase. His message today is as timely as it was when he wrote in on a train many years ago.  <br /> <br />Tozer implores the profession Chistian to eschew self and worldliness in order to know Christ in reality, not just in theory. He makes an airtight case that most of Christendom as we know it is peopled with professing, but not possessing. To Tozer, it was not enough to know the great Truths of Scripture, he had to experience them on a level far deeper than the intellect. This challenge to the so-called \\"church\\" was given to shake her out of complacency and exhort her to good-works and Godliness. <br /> <br />This is the type of book that will literally turn your world upside down.

Daniel Goleman makes an air-tight case as to why Emotional Intelligence is more a determiner of success than I.Q. His comments on page 80 perfectly encapsulates why this book should be required reading;<br />&quot;To the degree that our emotions get in teh way of or enchance our ability to think and plan, to pursue training for a distant goal, to solveproblems and the like, they define the limits of our capacity to use our innate mental abilities, and so determine how we do in life. And to the degree to which we are motivated by feelings of enthusiasm and pleasure in what we do- or even by an optimal degree of anxiety-they propel us to accomplishment. It is in this sense that emotional intelligence is a master aptitude, a capacity that profoundly affects all other abilities, either facilitating or interfering with them.&quot; <br />Emotional Intelligence, or the lack thereof, is why we see so much violence in our society; road-rage, bullies in schools, broken marriages, spousal and child abuse...the list goes on. We, as humans, have no earthly idea how powerful our emotions are- how easily and powerfully they overwhelm our resoning capacities, and &quot;common-sense,&quot; to our detriment, and to the detriment of those around us and the society at-large. <br />Who needs to read this book?

His premise that the adults in the relationship should work for a rapproachment (if total peace is not possible) for the sake of the children will not be popular in a culture where no-fault divorce is the preferred solution. <br />What I love about this book is the way Dr. Coleman approaches marriage; realistically. You may have started out with what you felt was a \\"match made in heaven,\\" or you may have been under an illusion that yours was a match made in heaven, but when things look like they are going south, this does not mean you bail. <br />Can you accept half a loaf (half a loaf is better than none)? How about a quarter or even an eighth of a loaf to ensure that your child's life is disrupted as little as possible? After all, it is all about the kids. <br />This book has a number of vignettes where Dr. Coleman is working with clients to change their expectations, or at the least help them to establish realistic expectations. He even goes so far to instruct partners how to live separate lives within their own home if getting along is no longer an option. <br />Imperfect Harmony takes a look at marriage unlike any book I have ever read on the subject. Sometimes things happen and things don't work out, but this is not to mean that everyone (especially the children) cannot live happily ever after. <br />If your marriage is in trouble, if you know someone with marital problems, or if you are interested in the topic of marriage as a counseling profession, this is a wonderful book to have. As a soon-to-be counselor I can actually envision myself using this book in couples and family therapy; assigning parts of the book for the clients to read for discussion in therapy. <br />Five plus stars for Imperfect Harmony.	2003-11-24

Anddrew Murray writes with the simplicity and love of a pastor, without soft-soaping or sugar-coating the truth. His abandonment and love for Christ is evident in all of his works and, therefore, qualifies him, in my opinion, to write a book on humility. You can tell he has experienced humility and that it is not just an intellectual excercise. <br />The one thing I took away from this book is that humility is indeed an experience; you can hear about the need to be humble, read, and even study about it. But unless the Spirit makes humility real personally to the individual, it is possible to become haughty about the need for being humble.<br />Andrew Murray's works have added so much to my Christian life; I feel closer to G-d because of the things he has written.	2003-11-21

Once upon a time, to be called a &quot;Christian&quot; meant that you were scorned, shunned by the world, and persecuted even to the point of death. Christians were known for the power of Christ evident in their lives, their love of G-d and their fellow humans, and their abandonment to Christ. <br />These days to call yourself a &quot;Christian&quot; is fashionable. All you need is a fish bumper sticker, a new-fangled translation of the bible under your arm, and this amorphous confession that &quot;Jesus is my Savior.&quot;<br />Dr. MacArthur's work falls within the spirit of Jude who wrote that we must &quot;earnestly contend for the faith that was once delivered to the saints,&quot; and this book does just that. Missing is the mawkish sentimentality that all a person needs to do is to &quot;accept Christ,&quot; as if He were some kind of begger petitioning for the sinner to allow Him into their lives. <br />With love, scholarly erudition, much buttressing by the canon of scriptures, and with clarity, Dr. Mac discusses in masterful detail just what it means to be a &quot;disciple of Jesus.&quot; The phrase &quot;what would Jesus do&quot; takes on a whole new meaning after reading this book. <br />Prior reviewers criticism of this classic work reveal why a book like this needs to be written in the first place. I think one of the key things Dr. MacArthur does in this book is to straighten out just what &quot;justification by faith&quot; is and is not. Modern day religonists have confounded the scriptures by confusing the forensic application of righteousness and the practical work of righteousness done by the Holy Spirt after the believer has submitted to Christ. As Martin Luther said in his commentary of Galatians, there is a judicial reckoning of righteousness--this has to do with the &quot;old man,&quot; and a practial, personal work of righteousness, which has to do with the &quot;new man.&quot; This alone is worth the price of the book as Dr. MacArthur rightly divides the word of truth, separating law from true grace--which is much different than antinomian dis-grace. <br />A must have for the new and seasoned believer alike. This book has had a profound influence on my walk with Jesus, dispelling a lot of misplaced beliefs I have held over the years.	2003-11-21

The superorganism called &quot;cahlchure&quot; is politely, yet categorically dismissed as the social science's equivalent of &quot;the magic bullet&quot; that killed JFK.<br />Humans are born with a sort of &quot;pre-packaging&quot; of software that can be examined and studied to find out why we do the things we do. Demagogues will automatically decry this as being too much &quot;nature&quot; and not enough &quot;nurture&quot; but the fact remains we are who we are.<br />This book blows the lid off the Boasian perspective on human nature and its censorious effect on real scholarship in the social sciences. In my own counseling studies I have witnessed first hand how professors immediately intercept, interrupt, and re-interpret any conversation that even hints at man having innate abilities, even though cognitive science has made great and historic advances in terms of how the brain works and operates. I read this book because I refuse to walk in ingnorace, even though the more &quot;politically correct&quot; view is that man is by nature, infinately perfectable. Hogwash!<br />Dr. Pinker deserves a lot of praise and credit for pushing back the frontiers of ignorace with this methodical, categorical treatment of this subject.	2003-11-20

It will never cease to amaze me that people will still cling to long-held beliefs even in the face of fresh and compelling evidence to the contrary. <br />Ms. Coulter's latest book is a scathing indictment of liberal disingenuousness. Many dislike her &quot;in your face&quot; style, but this has nothing to do with the fact that this lady does her research. <br />For too long the intelligencia, the literatti, and the glitterati have gotten a free pass regarding their incessant denigration of our great nation and her institutions that have served us so well. Labeling these views &quot;treasonous&quot; may be close to going over the top, but the fact remains, as post-9/11 biased, filtered, mainstream news coverage has born out, that there is a very, very small yet vocal segment of our society--namely media, entertainment, and academic elites, who despise this country.

The authors provide vocabulary and phrases for a pretty good number of school situations.

The authors would have done well to use conversation vignettes to introduce the topics they cover as giving the reader a context for use would go a long way to assimilating this vocabulary.

I read a fair amount of parenting books and, sad to say, many of them are little more than either &quot;psycho-babble&quot; or books on how to manipulate your child. <br />Positive Pushing is a wonderfully balanced look at this little discussed aspect of childhood; raising your children to be successful. <br />Dr. Taylor does a very thorough job of defining what true success is. He also does a very thorough job of delineating what the parental responsibilities are. I love the way he makes clear (throughout the book)how the parents themselves need to engage in defining their own values as well as resolving their own issues. This &quot;parenting from the inside out&quot; approach ensures that the parent does not work out his/her unresolved parental issues through their child, which, sadly, describes many, many parents. One of the main themes that underpines his work is &quot;what is in the best interests of the child.&quot; If we, as a society, had our child(ren)'s best interest in the forefront of our thinking, how different our world would look! <br />Parents would do well to read this book together, especially as their children approach school age. Yet, this book can be read and appreciated by parents who have children in the later grades. <br />Caution: This is not a book one can just breeze through and &quot;get.&quot; Dr. Taylor has buttressed his contention that children need to be positively pushed with a plethora of research, some longitudinal. He's done is homework, obviously, and the net result is this masterpiece that is destined to be an all-time classic in parenting literature. <br />A book I will continue to consult, both as a parent and as a (one day) counselor. As solid a book as you will ever read on child rearing.	2003-07-10

One of the greatest canards of the Clinton legacy is the notion that anything that portrays the ex-president, or his wife, in a negative way is politically motivated. <br />Buzz Patterson is a man of honor who did not seek to write a political memoir; rather, his work is an observational memoir. He makes no greater claims for his work, which he calls \\"an eyewitness account.\\"<br />The issue at hand in Dereliction of Duty is not whether or not President Clinton was, or was not a good president, or whether or not his policies were good policies. Col. Patterson's look at Mr. Clinton is an examination of his role as the Commander in Chief (CINC). <br />The colonel does a wonderful job at educating the reader in this often forgotten task every president has. The POTUS is not just a political animal who strives solely to get elected, than re-elected (although with the dawn of the modern presidency this is a sad, but permanent reality). The POTUS is the CINC of the United States Armed Forces. He, like the men and women who serve under him, are sworn to defend and protect this country from all enemies, foreign as well as domestic. <br />There are critical aspects to POTUS' job as CINC that should have (in an ideal setting) nothing to do with politics. Defending the United States is one of these duties, and Col. Patterson vividly describes the ex-president's negligance.<br />One of the more compelling and disturbing accounts involves Usama bin Laden. Col. Patterson reports that the CIA had intelligence on UBL's whereabouts (this was after the embassy bombings); there was a 2 hour window when he would be in a certain area, and the CIA \\"had him in the cross-hairs.\\"<br />Patterson does not speculate why, he merely reports that he and National Security Advisor Sandy Berger tried, in vain, for 55 minutes of the first hour to make contact. They were able to get Mr. Clinton on the phone; however, he and Berger debated for an entire hour on the necessity of the operation. During thistime, scores of military assets---i.e. planes, pilots, etc. were ready to lauch and waiting for the word. The \\"two hour window\\" closed and UBL would live to fight another day, which of course he did. <br />In no where in this, or other accounts, does Col. Patterson examine Mr. Clinton through a political lense; again, his account is an \\"eye witness\\" look at the president's role as the commander-in-chief.<br />Clinton lovers will naturally hate this book because it shows the ex-president and his wife as their natural selves. The Clintons come off as venal, petty, rude and hateful toward the military, and totally absorbed with themselves. <br />Supports of the Clinton's need to get over the fact that honorable men like Col. Patterson, will provide us with their \\"eye-witness\\" accounts, which is going to run contrary to the ever-spinning Clinton version. <br />Buzz Patterson's account, and others like his, are important contributions to our nation's history. Since Watergate, scores of books, articles, and commentaries have been written about the short-comings of the Nixon presidency, and the shortcomings of the late president. Why should Bill Clinton get a pass?	2003-06-04

To do so destroys the magic of the soul.<br />Early on in the book Moore establishes that in order to cultivate depth, sacredness, truth,simplicity, profundity, and reality in our inner lives, we must become curators of our own soul; he traces the etymology of the word \\"care,\\" in a way that sets the tone for the rest of the book. Get this right away, and the book will be a life transforming experience. Read it intellectually like most people read psychology/counseling/and psychotherapy books, and Care of the Soul will just seem like a lot of \\"new age\\" ..., which it is definately not.	2003-04-12

This book is a user friendly resource that will tell you everything you always wanted to know about assessment, but were afraid to ask because of a fear of being snowed under by a bunch of pedantic mumbo-jumbo. <br />Whether you are a counselor or special ed. teacher ( I am in training for the former, currently employed as the latter), this book takes a comprehensive look at assessment as a whole, involving families, reliability and validity, and a section in each chapter \\"what shapes our views.\\"<br />Excellent text, and reference.

Why?<br />Well for starters there is the logical way in which the authors have approached this daunting task. They give you a list of &quot;50 of the most common&quot; verbs en Espanol, then they list all 550 verbs in alphabetical order. On the page in which a &quot;common verb&quot; appears, there is a notation that this is a &quot;TOP 50 VERB!&quot;<br />I am also impressed by the way they have conjugated each verb in an understandable manner, and the examples of usage they offer for each of the 550 verbs. <br />This book has gone along way toward taking my Spanish &quot;to the next level,&quot; and I am quite certain it will do the same for you.<br />As cliche' as it sounds, this book is a &quot;must read&quot; for the serious student of Espanol.	2003-04-08

Early on in the book he makes a statement to the effect that anyone who has had to go through therapy that was from a two-parent home is intimately familiar with the shortcomings of the \\"two-parent\\" family.<br />His solution? The TRIBE. The Tribe according to Gurianian wisdom, (or the lack thereof), is the panacea for what ails our young me. If we can establish \\"three levels\\" of \\"family\\" around the boy; the 1st is the immediate family, to include grandparents, the 2d is the uncles, mentors, etc. the 3d is \\"the community,\\" this will make better boys. <br />Gurian basically has the same view of the family that Hillary Rodham Clinton does; \\"you can't do it alone.\\" Gurian dillutes the influence of the father (despite what he writes about the father's importance) when he puts forth the well-meaning, but misguided notion that the \\"other men\\" of the community are just as important as the father! Only the village can raise your child.<br />Mr. Gurian's Third World approach to child-rearing removes the personal responsibility adults have to (1)not make babies you cannot emotionally, or financially care for, and (2)If you do have a child, it's all about the child, so \\"get over it.\\" <br />Like so very many who share this Rodhamist perspective, Gurian blames \\"society;\\" this amorphous, mysterious,non-being that exerts its ... influence over humankind. Hogwash.<br />I want to build families up, not tear them down. Read this book with a gigantic grain of salt, because Gurian's \\"social philosophy\\" is greatly flawed.	2003-04-01

It was \\"kill and drill\\" all the way, but it worked and I got a great foundation of the basics (this is 1975 to 1979, mind you), which has allowed me to, in the past 6 mos., begin my studies anew \\"independientemene,\\" without feeling lost. <br />\\"Kill and drill\\" may be an anathman to the current zeitgeist in education, which stresses something called a \\"wholistic approach,\\" but it is a method that has been tried and true. It's not as sexy as some of the present day modes of educating, but it works.<br />This book will lay a very, very strong foundation to the beginner, as well as \\"fill in the blanks\\" for the intermediate and advanced learner. The author uses a no-nonsense approach, which means she eschews excessive comment, as well as comments that are not germane to learning how to process/use verbs, and she sticks to the basics- Verb ending for all tenses, and proper usage. You can't go wrong with an approach like that. She also does a masterful job with irregular verbs, which is the bug-a-boo for all learners, beginners and advanced alike. <br />If the companion book on Spanish Grammar is as good as this book, together they will make a \\"deadly combination;\\" one that will put the learner well on their way to the proverbial \\"next level.\\"	2003-02-20

Mr. Elder's recent work is chock-full of irrefutable examples of the wanton largesse of government,the rabid disingenuousness of the liberal media, and of racism against African-Americans who refuse to toe the party line with the Democratic party.<br />Each sentence is pregnant with Mr. Elder's passion for truth and justice. He is relentless with his attacks against the media's selective reporting and jaundiced view against anything and anyone outside the New York-Washington axis. <br />He is at his best when he assails the public school system in this nation and its abject failure in educating our children, this despite multiple billions of dollars of &quot;investment&quot; (investment is a liberal code word for taxation) by the Federal Government. Especially hard-hit are the very &quot;at-risk&quot; students that liberals purport to be championing- the inner city black youth. Mr. Elder makes a very strong and compelling case for education reform to include, but not limited to, school vouchers. <br />His libertarian stand on this and other issues is not at all popular with the &quot;blabocracy&quot; in this country. Nevertheless, I find his ideas a stimulating and refreshing alternative to the statist/socialist/communist viewpoint promulgated by the elite, mainstream press. A fantastic read!	2003-02-04

Although the charge of the media being \\"biased\\" is not a new one, still, this book is shocking. <br />If the issue were simply \\"liberals vs. conservatives\\" this book may not have been all that necessary. But what Mr. Goldberg keenly points out, the story within the story if you will, is how de facto censorship is practiced by the mainstream/elite press. Among other egregious examples are: (1) News magazine shows kill stories that portray minorities in a bad light. (2) News magazine shows seek out whites because whites make up the majority of the audience, hence, \\"its all about ratings. (3)Reporters are notorious for asking \\"softball\\" questions to those with whom they share the same (leftist) political ideology. (4) The label \\"conservative,\\" \\"conservative-extremist,\\" and/or \\"right-wing conservative,\\" are always used in conjunction with someone whose views are right-of-center. A Lexis-Nexus search reveals that similiar labels for \\"liberals\\" are virtually never used. <br />Contrary to what some reviewers have opined, I don't think Mr. Goldberg is at all guilty of \\"sour grapes\\" or \\"disloyalty\\" to his former boss, \\"The Dan\\" Rather. Goldberg simply tells it like it is, and, unfortunately for \\"The Dan\\" the picture that is portrayed is of an anchorman who is venal, petty, thin-skinned, and a lot like the old Ted Baxter character on the Mary Tyler Moore Show, i.e. he has a massive, to-a-fault, ego. <br />I say \\"BRAVO\\" to Mr. Goldberg for having the guts to tell it like it is. For the sake of sane, honest, and rational debate in the public forum of ideas something like this needed to be done. For too long the \\"Dans, Toms, and Peters\\" hegemony has gone unchallenged, and their contempt for anything and anyone outside the \\"New York-Washington Axis\\" has been ignored. <br />Bias is a great read. Truly, the emperors at the networks have no clothes.	2003-01-27

Ms. Coulter, fast becoming the bete noir of liberals, has penned a masterpiece exposing the intellectual dishonesty, and outright savagery of the mainstream press toward things conservative. <br />It is very difficult arguing against someone who quotes the very words you use in order to buttress their contention. This is exactly what Ms. Coulter does, and she does it relentlessly! We have become so conditioned to the &quot;blabocracy's&quot; prattle that we hardly notice just what fools they really are. But when you have what amounts to a compilation of their thoughts on the substantive issues of the day, you begin to see a pattern; a pattern of half-truth, in some cases no-truth, and generally a wanton contempt for the truth, if the truth does not jive with their worldview. <br />Slander has exposed the literati for what they are; petty, mean, vindictive, and intolerent of viewpoints other than their own. What is practiced by the mainstream press today is nothing more than de facto censorship, yet the talking heads piously proclaim their innocence. This in the face of literally mountains of evidence to the contrary (see &quot;Bias,&quot; and &quot;The Vision of the Anointed). <br />Ms. Coulter has made a significant contribution to the political dialogue in this country, this despite the fact that she has been virtually ignored by ABCCBSNBCCNNTHENEWYORKTIMESWASHINGTONPOST, et. al. <br />After reading this book you will see why sane people no longer rely on the &quot;BIG 3&quot; and their fellow mouthpieces for the Democratic party for their news, but rather are turning to alternatives such as Fox News, and the Internet for their information.	2003-01-21

Thousands of years after they were written by the finger of G-d, the 10 Commandments still inspire some, and enrage others.

The first five commandments deal with our obligations to G-d, the second five deal with our obligations to each other. Far from being the \\"rules of oppression\\" as some would have you to believe, the 10 commandments were written and handed down to give mankind guidelines for love, respect, and honor. <br />Dr.Laura's approach is from a unique perspective; there are'nt many Gentiles like myself who have read biblical perspectives from a Jewish standpoint.

If as a student all you ever were some of the mainstream texts/resources, which are so reductionistic, you would come away with a view of the family that would have you questioning whether or not the very institution itself is viable for sustaining the mental health of all of its members.<br />Not so Virginia Satir's work which is very positive and uplifting. She resists the temptation to simplistically blame everything on &quot;dysfunction&quot; between the partners in the &quot;marital dyad,&quot; and instead looks at the family as a collection of imperfect individuals who all have a potential to grow and learn.<br />I especially like her emphasis on finding the family's strengths and building on those. Anyone can take a look and come up with &quot;what's wrong.&quot; But this does nothing to solve problems and foster resiliency, which all families need in this decidedly familly-hostile culture.<br />Whether you are an experienced family therapist, counselor-to-be,or a mental health generalist, if you work with and have an interest in families, I encourage you to get to know the works of Virginia Satir. This one perfectly encapsulates her paradigm for working with families in need.	2002-12-06

Dr. McGee's commentary is an excellent resource if you are going through this book during your daily devotional time, or a small group study. <br />What I love about the Dr. McGee's commentaries is that he &quot;compares spiritual things with spiritual,&quot; meaning he does not give an interpretation on an isolated verse without running it through the entire Bible from Genesis to Revelation. <br />I have purchased several of Dr. McGee's commentaries, and so far I have not been disappointed. If you are looking for a resource that will help you experience one of the great prophetic books of the Bible, this book is for you.	2002-12-03

I can't say I agree with all of the author's statements regarding Israel, but what he does have correct, and what he did an excellent job in doing, is to outline step-by-step Israel's captivity, eventual return to the Land, as well as their future in the Millenial Kingdom when Jesus sits on the throne as the Son of David. <br />A good resource if you are looking for a brief overview that will help you get through the Books of Samuel, Chronicles, Kings, as well as the major and minor prophets.	2002-12-03

Dr. McGee's examination of this apocalyptic book is simple, yet meticulously delivered. He eschews fanciful speculation and instead seeks to let the Scriptures speak for themselves as he expounds on the major themes; judgement on the whole house of Israel, the Holiness of God, and Israel's future restoration. <br />Dr. McGee's books are excellent for personal devotional time, or in a small group Bible study.	2002-11-26

Although it does not go into any great theological depth (then again why does it have to?), this commentaryis an excellent introduction to this mysterious, prophetic book. <br />&quot;Comparing spiritual things with spiritual,&quot; Dr. McGee eschews pointless speculation, and fantastic theorizing in order to present a clear picture of this book, which is that it is the gateway book to endtime Bible prophecy. <br />This book is ideal for a daily devotional guide, as well as a group study guide. I would certainly use it either way. <br />If the commentary on Daniel is indicative of the way his other commentaries are written, I will be purchasing more of the late J. Vernon McGee's books.	2002-11-19

As a special education teacher in the public schools I face the legacy of divorce, in all its stark, naked and painful reality, each and every day. Although I have personally encountered many students who voice the same issues as outlined in this book, Dr. Wallerstein's work still broke my heart. <br />Whenever the subject of divorce is raised, sides automatically are taken with regard to the rights of each partner, yet no one ever thinks of the children. This book needs to be required reading in every psychology, social work, or counseling program so that practioners are exposed to another side of divorce; the side that is not typically portrayed in academia, as well as in our popular culture. <br />This book may be considered &quot;politically incorrect&quot; to many because Dr. Wallerstein does not proffer the tired, shopworn feminst perspective. Yet her voice is an important one because it advocates for the party who has the least power, yet is most effected by the decision to divorce; the children.	2002-09-23

Race is the 3d rail of politics in America and unless you accept, without question and without reservation, the basic tenets of the Civil Rights movement, you are considered &quot;insensitive,&quot; or, at worst, a &quot;racist.&quot; Mr. D'Souza systematically, and with erudition, challenges this worldview head on. <br />This book is chock-full of thought-provoking perspectives, not the least of which is the distinction between racism and ethnocentrism. Relying on the abudant historical record, D'Souza buttresses his assertion, which winds up striking at the heart of the Civil Rights-Leftist-Multiculturalis canard that racism was responsible for slavery, ergo, reparations are in order. <br />D'Souza is not without his critics, who  run the gamut from the scholary, to the demagogic. Still, don't let this scare you from reading this book. D'Souza is no race-baiter by any means. His look at race and culture in America is unsentimental and clear-headed. He comes across as genuinely concerned about the state of race relations in this country, and his book offers a refreshing alternative to the tired, shop-worn, pap from the Left.	2002-09-04

Abnormal Psych. by Dr. Comer is without a doubt one of the best textbooks I have ever used. Why? There are a number of reasons. <br />(1) This book has one author, so therefore the book speaks with one voice. Professors who wish to write books need to heed the adage &quot;too many cooks spoil the soup.&quot; I am glad Dr. Comer did because he has written a text that is easy to follow, concept by concept. <br />(2) With regard to concepts: Many professors write textbooks as if other professors will be reading them. Not Dr. Comer. This text is not only appropriate for the graduate student, the unininitiated will benefit from this book as well. He uses lean prose, simple-to-understand language and synatx. <br />(3) Dr. Comer's book is very logically structured. He presents each psychopathology, looks at it from each perspective, e.g. psychodynamic, behavioral, cognitive, existential, etc., then he outlines how each school of thought would deal with the issue. The vignettes sprinkled throughout each chapter are very informative. A nice supplement. <br />I bought this book in order to get a handle on some of the principles of abnormal psych. before I take a graduate psychopathology course this fall. Not having had abnormal psych at the undergraduate or graduate level, I was looking for a text that would &quot;bring me up to speed,&quot; before I start class this fall. <br />Thanks to Dr. Comer, I'll be ready!	2002-07-28

As a counseling major in grad school, I have had the opportunity to examine and peruse a couple of texts that purport to teach the reader the fine art of counseling and intentional interviewing. This book is by far the best I have come across and here is why.<br />First off, it is logically structured. The authors start out with a very sound introduction to the craft, and metting the client for the first time. From this point the book gradually and systematically introduces the various and sundry microskills and techniques. But what impressed me about this is that along with introducing the microskills and giving examples, the authors provide in-depth process commentary on when, where, how, and why you could use a particular technique. <br />Beginning students need to be impressed with the fact that interviewing must be intentional. There should be a rhyme and reason, a method to your madness (no pun intended), and this book does an excellent job at getting the student started on the right track. Too many students come into beginning interviewing classes with preconceived ideas; you can tell they have been watching too much television!<br />This book is definately a keeper!	2002-07-22

What is missing in our society is the institution of &quot;fatherhood;&quot; the process whereby the patriarch of the family takes his rightful place in the family as leader, provider, protector, and nurturer. <br />Feminists will hate this book because Blankenhorn uses scientific study, statistics,logic, and, at times, rhetoric and polemics to conclusively state that the absence of true fathers is indeed the &quot;most urgent social problem of our kind.&quot;<br />Whether unwittingly, or by design, feminists have played a big part in destroying this sacred institution; their call for the &quot;rights&quot; of women did not stop there. There has been a full-scale diminution of fatherhood, to the detriment of all involved, and, ultimately, society. <br />This jeremiad is a must read for anyone, i.e. parents, teachers, ministers, social-workers, and counselors, who are concerned about the state of our youth today. Blankenship proves that without a father, all is chaos in the family. <br />A truly dynamic and passionate book. I cannot believe that there has not been any noticeable public acclaim for this book,but then again I should not be surprised given the antipathy with which academia, the media, and the various and sundry other members of the literati, view the &quot;traditional family.&quot;<br />We see how women and children suffer.

The mental health field has a propensity to look for the root causes of psychopathology either within the person, i.e. intra-<BR>psychic or neurobiological, or as a result of socialization. For some obscure reason, the family component is rarely considered. This book seeks to remedy this oversight. <br />Family Pathology takes a probing look at the relational roots of dysfunctional behavoir. Genetics, physiology, and society may play roles in the development of maladaptive behvior, but the individual is embedded in a family structure that mediates these influences for better of for worse. <br />This book also includes chapters on family therapy, preventive approaches, and parent training programs. To date, the psychopathology literature has not had such a thorough treatment of the family's role in dysfunctional behavior; this book changes that by offering an insightful look into the &quot;nature-nurture&quot; assumptions. <br />A must read for grad. students and practioners alike.	2002-06-03

The authors cogently, and compellingly use historical trends to show that democracy as we know it is at an end. <br />Many will decry this book's &quot;apocalyptic tone&quot; but the fact remains that statistics don't lie: the majority of people do not vote in any election, which is one of the leading indicators of a democracy's demise. The authors use the example of the Roman church's hold on power during the Dark ages as a prime example of a system that lost its hold due to decadence from within. Because the leader's lived large at the expense of the common man, people no longer felt that religion had a relevence to their lives. <br />The same is true with politics today. We all know that the ruling class in this country lives large with perquisities and privaleges befitting royalty, all at taxpayer expense. Washington, or &quot;inside the Beltway,&quot; is perceived as being so far removed from our daily lives that most politicians are looked upon with derision. Just watch how mercilessly they are pillioried in the popular culture, and in the media. This contempt for the nobles is but one of many signs that the nation-state is at an end. <br />It is very hard to get the average person to understand that times have changed, and the changes will dramatically effect our lives in every way. It is natural to want to hold onto what is familiar and safe. But the things that will be, will be regardless of protest or mawkish sentimentality, and these two authors have their fingers on the pulse of the future.	2002-05-23

Smith Wigglesworth may be thought of as one of those &quot;old-timers&quot; from an age gone by, but if there is one thing to be learned from this, as well as his other writings, it is this: Jesus promised that &quot;the works that I do shall ye do also, and greater than this shall ye do, because I go to my Father who is in Heaven.&quot; John 14:12 and Heb. 13:8 are as true today as the day they were written. <br />If we as Christ's body could ever apprehend the simple teachings of this simple man, who was endued with &quot;power from on high,&quot; we would indeed fulfill the aforementioned scriptures, as well as Mark 16, to name just a few. Bro. Wigglesworth believed that the Christian's Divine Right, as purchased by the Christ of Calvary for His people, was to live on a &quot;higher plane.&quot; He truly lived a life of holiness, which produced a faith that could stare down the enemy; this is said not to honor or worship the man, but to give us faith that &quot;all things, whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer, believing, ye shall receive.&quot; <br />Greater Works is one of those &quot;unknown&quot; Christian Classics that belongs on the bookshelf of every believer, along with Charles Finney and F.F. Bosworth.	2002-05-21

Long after Dr. Yalom has departed for that great therapist's office in the sky, this book will still be known as a must read for the novice and veteran counselor because of the common-sense and compassionate advice it offers. This is Dr. Yalom's Opus Magnum.<br />I first came across Dr. Yalom's works when I took a required course in group therapy, and his text on the subject was the reference for the course. It did not take me long to gain a sense of awe at his wisdom, the likes of which can only be compared to something usually reserved for a demi-god. Nevertheless, Dr. Yalom is a wise man who has &quot;been there,&quot; and his writings reflect the wisdom of his years. <br />The Gift of Therapy will renew your sense of passion for the mental health field. Dr. Yalom has a way of giving his readers insight into the therapy process, which affords the practioner or therapist-to-be a vantage point that will make him or her appreciative of all of the good we can do in the service of humankind. <br />There were times when reading this book, when I had to set it down and ruminate on what I had just read; Dr. Yalom has a way of expressing the profound, without pedantry, and the sublime, without silliness. After reading this book I am literally in awe of this &quot;giant&quot; and I am proud that we are both serving humanity in the same field.	2002-05-16

Where was this book when I had to take an assessment class during the fall 2001 Term? <br />At any rate, even though I have already taken an assessment course, I bought this book anyway for my own personal reference. Crazy you say? Consider this...<br />Counselors have to be good consumers of assessments and the information they yield. While no one in their right mind advocates the &quot;test and tell approach,&quot; ascribing a level of omniscience reserved only for deity, still tests and measurements can yield a lot of useful data. But what to do with it all? This is where this text comes in. <br />It is simply good, ethical practice to be able to have a fairly good working understanding of the how,when,where, and whys of assessment. <br />Whether you are taking a class, or need a refresher, or you are like me and you are a nut when it comes to doing this the correct way, this book is for you, price notwithstanding.	2002-05-16

I am a special education teacher that had struggled to find a method to teach children how to decode; especially those children who were left behind by the &quot;whole language&quot; or &quot;literature based&quot; approach to reading. When it came right down to it, my students had never been taught how to decode the letter-sound code, which is what the English language is based upon. <br />I came upon Reading Reflex after reading the book &quot;Why Our Children Can't Read, and What We Can Do About it&quot; by Dianne McGuiness, who is Geoffrey McGuiness' mother. That book convinced me that I needed to find away to teach children how to read, based upon (1) how children learn, and (2) teach them English the way English needs to be taught. <br />Reading Reflex, along with a magnetic letter board which has the 37 common word families was a blessing. In one example, I had a 5th grade student that no one ever bothered to teach to read because he was a behavior problem. At the end of a week of drills using Reading Reflex, he was reading the simple stories in the book, which was a powerful motivator to persevere with me, and now he is reading Dr. Suess books. <br />Research has shown that explicit, one on one phonics instruction; letter-to-sound correspondence instructions, works. If you are a teacher, or a parent of a student that has yet to &quot;get it,&quot; try Reading Reflex. You will not be disappointed.	2002-03-16

The Lexus and the Olive Tree is written just as thoroughly and authoritatively. <br />Mr. Friedman uses actual events he has witnessed to back up his assertions and hypothesis on the origins and the impact of globalization. I think this book does not sit well with many because Friedman is so adept at sweeping away the norms and assumptions that characterized the \\"old order.\\" Put simply, America, in many ways is no longer the \\"global hegemon\\" and the world's reference point. When you think about the fact that 15 years ago Thailand was a poverty-ridden backwater, barely subsisting on a \\"rice economy\\" and now it is the world's second largest producer of pick-up trucks (second to Detroit), and the world's fourth largest producer of motorcycles, it is safe to assume that \\"globalization\\" has unleashed the pent-up potential of many countries like Thailand, and that this is bound to have an impact on the \\"shape of the world.\\" <br />I applaud Mr. Friedman for not being bound by selfish interests and fatuous loyalties to outdate orthodoxies. The majority may choose to stick their heads in the sand and refuse to acknowledge the forces at work in the world today, but the reality is that globalization is here to stay.	2002-02-21

He can plumb the depths of scripture &quot;comparing spiritual things with spiritual&quot; without being pedantic. I am using this book in my own personal devotional time, and I am using some of his thoughts on election and predestination in a teaching series at our church. <br />Dr. MacArthur does a masterful job at making clear the believer's position in Christ. His approach is easily accessible to clergy and layman alike. He brings out strong doctrine, without dogmatism, or denominational slant. <br />Eventually, I hope to own most if not all of Dr. MacArthur's commentaries as I feel that they are immensely edifying.	2001-11-21

I was especially encouraged by his treatment of bullying in this book because of the prevalence of the \\"culture of cruelty,\\" in adolescence. <br />Parents, counselors, teachers, mentors; anyone with an a vested interest in the well being of boys will find this book to be a valuable resource that will provide support. <br />This book, unlike many other \\"pop-psych\\" type books, is very well researched (without being pedantic), and very well reasoned. As a counseling student in graduate school I have used this book several times as a reference. <br />With the abuse of children reaching pandemic proportions, we need more men (as well as women) like Dr. Newberger using their insight of child development to advocate for better treatment of children.

Murray uses scores of scriptures to illustrate that it is God's will for His children to experience and enjoy Him in His fullness. This work will transform the prayer life of anyone willing to humble themselves before Him.	2001-08-12

I am convinced that if Watchman Nee were alive, and he was allowed to preach in our churches, he would not be invited to come back. His message is God-centered, and God-glorifying, unlike the Christian hedonism we see that is so much of our popular culture. <br />Bro. Nee uses very simple language, and numerous examples from the scriptures to drive home to the Christian that in order to be a subject of the Kingdom of God, you have to be submitted to the principles that the Kingdom operates by. This is a far cry from the do-as-you-please attitude that the majority of so-called Christians have. If this book makes anything clear, it is that it is possible to do God a service, without it being His will. <br />Did not Jesus Himself say that &quot;Not everyone that saith 'Lord, Lord' shall enter into the Kingdom, but he that doeth the will of my Father?&quot; <br />Read this book prayerfully and allow the Holy Ghost to convict your heart, and cleanse you from all manner of rebellion. For to obey is better than sacrifice.	2001-08-09

The struggle to understand the parent-child bond touches us deeply because we intuitively sense that our first relationships hold many clues to how we've become who we are (Karen, 1994). I chose to do a report on this book because of the keen interest I have in children, their development, well-being and emotional life.<br />Dr. Karen's book is a goldmine of insight, posing the age-old question ; How do we become who we are? Central to the answer is attachment theory, which, in the words of Dr. Karen, 'encompasses both the quality and strength of the parent-child bond, the ways in which it forms and develops, how it can be damaged and repaired, and the long-term impact of separations, losses, wounds, and deprivations. Beyond that, it is a theory of love and its central place in human life' ...<br />I feel that I came across this book serendipitously as Dr. Karen's work has further added to my knowledge base, and my understanding by confirming opinions I have developed by watching people interact with children. After reading this book you will find yourself noticing certain behaviors on display that may have previously escaped your gaze. I can't stress how much this book as helped me as a special ed. teacher, parent, and as a counseling practitioner-to-be.<br />I earnestly hope that I have the opportunity to share these insights with teachers, administrators, parents, and especially children as my career progresses.	2001-08-09

Books	5	10	13	N	Y	Dr. Mac contends for the faith once delivered to the saints.	The debate over the place of works in the life of the believer is one that has been waged since James wrote in his epistle &quot;works without faith is dead.&quot; There is, sadly, a very large segment within Christendom that shuns the very mention of &quot;works&quot; because they fear a return to the &quot;yoke of bondage&quot; of legalism. That is why a book like this is necessary. <br />The byproduct of the &quot;simple faith&quot; &quot;accept Jesus&quot; interpretation of scripture is an easy-believe-ism that makes no demands on the professor to &quot;bring forth fruit meet for repentance,&quot; or to exhibit any proof (Jesus called it &quot;fruit&quot;) of their faith. Millions have been deluded into accepting a false Christ, i.e. accepting Jesus as Savior, but not as Lord, and as a consequence have based their eternal destination on apostasy. <br />Dr. MacArthur's book is a clarion call to &quot;earnestly contend for the faith that was once delivered to the saints.&quot; While salvation is by faith alone, it is not a faith that is alone. Unlike his critics, Dr. Mac allows the cannon of scripture to speak for itself on what it means to be a &quot;disciple of Jesus,&quot; and, hence, his case is a compelling one. This book provides the answer why we see so many people professing to be Christians, yet still living like they are in the world.	2001-07-31

Sproul's work compels the reader to &quot;earnestly contend for the faith that was once delivered to the saints.&quot; He logically, scripturally, and systematically destroys the eccumenical position on salvation as its proponents have arrogated to themselves the responsibility to decide what is &quot;essential&quot; for man to be saved, even though Jesus Himself said that &quot;Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God. <br />Papists and their apologists will hate this book, for Rev. Sproul leaves no doubt that there cannot be &quot;two Gospels.&quot; He masterfully shows how the signers of the ECT have been duped into thinking they have achieved some great milestone for &quot;unity,&quot; when what they really have done is compromised on a key doctrine (justification)the loss of which threw Christendom into 1000 years of the Dark Ages. <br />A classic work to be read by all Christians in order to gain a foundational understanding of our faith. Far too many who profess Christ no so little about what His Word teaches. This book is an exhortation to all to &quot;endure sound doctrine.&quot;	2001-07-31

Because of our desire to be &quot;open&quot; and not repressed about sex and sexuality, because we don't want to do anything that would have a &quot;chilling effect&quot; on free speech, and because advertising has mercilessly and shamelessly propagated the religon of consumerism, while pop-psychology makes converts to a humanist, man-centered existentialism that places the emphasis on &quot;self-esteem&quot; over responsibility, this is why we have the rot we see today.<br />Dr. Pipher was right on the mark in her observation that people develop &quot;relationships&quot; with media figures, to the detriment of themselves and society. One only has to look at the circulation figures for magazines like &quot;People,&quot; &quot;The National Enquirer,&quot; and the other tabloids for proof. People talk about the stars of WWF as if they have known them all their lives; the latest celebrity gossip vies with actual news stories on the evening news for headline coverage. Because of our inate desire to belong and to fellowship, we crave human contact. Yet we live in a culture where most of us don't even know who our next door neighbors are. <br />A lot of the criticism of Dr. Pipher's book on this site has been picayune and childish. You don't need to be a cultural anthropoligist, or have an advanced degree in family therapy to recognize that our society is in trouble. The American Family is in the crosshairs, under relentless assault. <br />Dr. Mary Pipher is to be highly commended for this book, which like her earlier work &quot;Reviving Ophelia&quot; correctly takes aim at our popular culture for its contribution to the destruction of decency in our society.<br />This book would benefit all families. Highly recommended!	2001-07-20

Admittedly, Erik Erikson is not an easy read (in fact his biographer Lawrence Friedman speculates what Erikson could have become had he been a more disciplined researcher, and writer.) Nevertheless this book provides keen insight into the phenomenon of the adolescent identity crisis. <br />&quot;Crisis&quot; in Eriksonian parlance is not used to connote an &quot;impending catastrophe,&quot; but rather a &quot;necessary turning point, a crucial moment, when development must move one way or another, marshaling resources of growth,recover, and further differentiation.&quot; Erikson deals effectively with a process that is at the core of the individual and in the core of the individual's communal culture. <br />After reading Lawrence Friedman's biography on Erikson entitled &quot;Identity's Architect,&quot; I have come to appreciate the richness of Erikson's observations, such as &quot;I shall present human growth from the point of view of the conflicts, inner and outer, which the vital personality weathers, re-emerging from each crisis with an increased sense of inner unity...,&quot; knowing that Erikson himself came to such conclusions only after examining his own storied past. <br />The illegitimate son of a Danish mother, and a father of unknown nationality, &quot;Identity's Architect&quot; weathered many a conflict, both inner and outer, as he journeyed toward a sense of his own identity. <br />Identity: Youth and Crisis is not an easy read, but it is rich with insight into the most mysterious and turbulent of all stages in the life cycle: adolescence. Ideal for those students of child psychology, child development, and those who work with youth.	2001-07-07

After reading this book, I came to the conclusion that every hospital in the country ought to have a supply on hand to give out to new parents/caregivers upon the birth of a son, much like car dealers give you an owner's manual when you buy a car. <br />Continuing on with the metaphor, after reading this book, I came to the conclusion that we know more about cars than we do about children! This book should be read by...<br />*Anyone who has a son, regardless of whether your relationship with him is good or bad. This book will help you understand the dynamics of father/son, and mother/son relationships; insight that will be vital during the turbulent adolescent years.<br />*Teachers, and administrators. Our educational system is so female dominated, that many of the well-intentioned ladies who come in contact with boys on a daily basis, have no clue what they are all about, and consequently, you see a disproportionate number of boys who are identified as having learning disabilities, get suspended, and/or otherwise in trouble at school. <br />*Every father, since fathers typically and traditionally, yet tragically, leave all &quot;emotional issues&quot; for mom to address. No more slacking dads! It is time to start pulling your weight!!<br />My heart ached after reading this book. It ached because with a little understanding, we would not see so many boys messed up. The authors of this book have made a wonderful contribution to the literature on child development and child rearing. Kindlon and Thompson make a compelling case that if we do not start doing better as parents, teachers, coaches, etc. etc. in helping our boys attain emotional literacy, the price in human terms will be incalculable. <br />I can honestly say that after reading this book, I will never be able to look at boys the same way again.

At first glance, it is easy to be a bit cynical when you see a book entitled &quot;Strategies That Work,&quot; especially when it deals with the subject of teaching students to read. I have to admit I was, until I started reading this book and putting into practice Harvey and Goudvis' common-sense strategies for empowering students to make meaning from what they have read. <br />So many of our children can decode, and are as fluent as we are, yet when it comes to comprehension, inferencing, and extending meaning, they are completely lost. Not any more; Strategies at Work to the rescue! <br />There isn't enough room to review all of my favorite strategies, but I will offer one; for me, Chapter 8, which deals with Visualizing and Inferring is worth the price of the book. <br />The authors walk you through how to get students to visualize, or as they so elequently put it &quot;make movies in your mind,&quot; as a way of establishing connections with text in order to improve comprehension. In the section entitled &quot;Inferential Thinking: Reading Between the Lines,&quot; teachers are given strategies to model and help students think more abstractly in order to extend meaning, which is a skill that many of the state standardized tests are requiring our students to do. <br />&quot;Strategies that Work&quot; is one of the few books I have read that actually deliver on what they promise.

I absolutely adore books like this because they take a lighthearted, yet sensitive look at concerns that are very real in the minds of small children as they enter school. <br />Lunch Bunnies is the story of a little boy named Clyde who harbors an irrational fear of making a fool out of himself on his first day of school, in the lunchroom. Anyone with small children can instantly relate how Clyde becomes obsessive with doing the lunchroom thing right! <br />The night before his first day at a new school, Clyde is seen &quot;practicing&quot; by carrying a tray of food. Of course there is a big brother present (Jefferson)who does his best to plant seeds of doubt in Clyde's mind and delights in tormenting the poor lad with stories of inedible food (&quot;Mystery Goosh), and the ubiquitous lunch ladies with &quot;bristly&quot; faces who have  all of the charm and caring of a Third World Dictator. Poor Clyde is scared to death! <br />My favorite part of the book was when it was time for the children to queue up, and proceed into the lunchroom. As a teacher of small children myself, I can't help but wonder if the author is not poking gentle fun at the anality of the lunchroom ritual, where children must quietly, in monk-like manner, line up and process orderly, much as inmates are required to in correctional centers. <br />Nevertheless, this book was a hit with my 10 year old daughter when she first started school, and it is a hit with my son, who will start first grade this fall. All children, and even some of us adults, have irrational fears that we blow way out of proportion. But the message of Lunch Bunnies, a message adults would do well to heed, is that nothing is as bad as we imagine it, and things always seem to work out just fine.	2001-06-29

I am a teacher of children with mild to moderate learning disabilities who plans on using this book as a springboard to teach Language Arts to 4th and 6th graders this fall.

I had been introduced to the theories of Erik H. Erikson in a grad. course in Educational Psychology. The course introduced just enough of Erikson to whet my appetite to learn more about the man; I am glad I did because after reading this book, I feel I have gained a richer understanding of his 8 Stage Life Cycle Theory, and the concept of Identity. <br />Professor Friedman's book is compassionate, but not fawning. He gives as complete a picture of a very complex man; as complete as one would hope to have, and he does so in a non-judgemental way. <br />There are many unattractive aspects of Erikson the man; why did this sensitive man, this lover of children who was estranged from his own step-father, virtually disown his own son, who had Down's Syndrome, and have him institutionalized? What made him so ambivalent about his Jewish identity? Friedman explores these issues in a very thorough, yet compassionate way. Erikson himself had a difficult time reconciling the dark side of Gandi while writing his biography; lovers of Erikson, like myself, may have that same struggle while reading this book, but Mr. Friedman does a superb job of bringing out, and sythesizing the &quot;dark Erik&quot; with the Erikson whose works have inspired many a generation of people like myself who are advocates for the welfare of children. <br />I read this book first before reading &quot;Childhood and Society&quot; and &quot;Identity Youth and Crisis&quot; and I am glad I did, for Eriksons paradigm was born from his own identity crisis he suffered, which Friedman does a masterful job of portraying. <br />If you really want to understand Erikson's Works, read this book first.

This book is without a doubt one of the best Christian books I have ever read. It is the story of how the gifts of the Holy Spirit were poured out on a little cogregation at the turn of the 20th century.<br />Azusa Street is the eyewitness account of the story of the 1907 outpouring of the Holy Spirit on Azusa Street in Los Angeles, recounted by Frank Bartleman. It is the story of how God searched out vessels who were fit for the Master's use; vessels that had been purified by years of prayer and fasting, as well as a deep repentance of the most secret, and vilest of sins. <br />This book tells the story of how meetings &quot;ran&quot; themselves, whenever the pastor was late, or unable to come. It is the story of sinners begging God for forgiveness of sin and deliverance; it is the story of travail of soul to see more of God, and less of self. <br />I am sincere when I say that after prayerfully reading this book, you will be challenged to jettison your cold-formal religon, and you will be compelled to repent of your backslidden ways. I know that I was. I read this book for the first time about 5 years ago, and I frequently revisit it, and learn anew how I need to decrease, so that Christ may increase. <br />Read this book, and weep!	2001-04-29

This book is the story about a man whose life and ministry was uniquely guided by the Holy Spirit. It is the story of a humble man who learned the secret of cultivating a rich, inside life with God through prayer, and whose life bore abundant fruit as a consequence. <br />Although this type of life has to be experienced in order to be understood, Rees Howells does offer some compelling insight on how the Holy Ghost dealt with the very inner reaches of his heart in order to teach him obedience. Mr. Howells is very candid about how, and in what ways his flesh fought the leading of the spirit; how he had to do as the apostle Paul admonishied and &quot;cast down reasonings and bring every thought to the obedience of Christ. <br />This is a wonderful book that can be enormously edifying, whether you are reading it as I did, as part of your own personal devotional time with God, or in a group Bible study.<br />Put simply, if you want to read a book about being a true disciple of Jesus, about what it means to count the cost, take up your cross and follow Him, Rees Howells: Intercessor is the book for you. But a word of caution: the type of life set forth in this book is not the run-of-the-mill, intellectual Christianity that so predominates our popular culture in the 21st Century. This book is a call to a rugged faith, a call to &quot;earnestly contend for the faith that was once delivered to the saints.&quot; <br />Read it prayerfully, and get ready to be &quot;transformed by the renewing of your mind.&quot; For this book will compel the serious Christian to &quot;present your body as a living sacrifice to God...&quot;	2001-04-28

The apostle Paul wrote in the book of Romans that God is not the &quot;author of confusion.&quot; As you listen to Christian radio and TV programs, another picture emerges; a picture of a Christ that is a product of antinomian folly, and mawkish sentimentality who is reduced to the status of a beggar pleading with recalcitrant, stiff-necked worldlings to &quot;accept Jesus,&quot; when the Bible teaches no such doctrine. <br />Enter AW Pink, an oftimes tart-tongued pastor who puts for the question &quot;Who is regulating affairs on this earth today-God, or the Devil?,&quot; then meticulously embarks on a scriptural study that provides the answer &quot;...though the world is panic-stricken, the wod to the believer is 'Fear not! All things are subject to His (God's) immediate control: all things are moving in accord with His eternal purpose, and therefore, all things are working toether for good to them that love God, to them who are called according to His purpose.&quot;<br />Rev. Pink himself knew that &quot;It would be foolish for us to expect that this work will meet with general approval.&quot; He saw the trend in modern Christendom (so-called) as being toward the &quot;deification of the creature rather than the glorification of the Creator.&quot; <br />This book presents a relentless defining of not only the sovereignty of God, but also His sovereignty in Creation, Administration, Salvation, Reprobation, and in Prayer, to name a few. Arthur Pink exposes the modern gospel as a weak, apostate faith that has &quot;relagt(ed) God to the background.&quot; <br />After reading this book, the Bible will become a new book to you. You will never be able to look at scripture, the world, yourself, or God the same again.	2001-04-22

Using Bible prophecy and world events dating to the time of Christ, Mr. Hunt presents a well-defined portrait of an institution that historian Will Durant said &quot;reveal(s) a ferocity unknown in any beast.&quot; <br />&quot;Comparing spiritual things with spiritual,&quot; as the apostle Paul commanded us to, Dave hunt unveils the &quot;mystery&quot; behind &quot;Mystery Babylon&quot; in the Book of Revelation. He exposes the lunacy of papal infallibility, the terror of their tyranny, the unholy alliances made with governments throughout the ages, all for the purpose of establishing the Roman Catholic Church's religous and political hegemony. <br />Papists and their apologists, along with Eccumenical-minded Protestants will hate this book; those that are &quot;earnestly contending for the faith that was once delivered to the saints&quot; will love it! This book is far from being a book of &quot;hate speech&quot; as other reviewers have said.

As a youth, like many of his compatriots, he had steeped himself in the lore of Polish messianism, the idea that Poland was the Christ of the Nations that one day would rise again to point the way for all of humanity.&quot; So begins this spellbinding account of Pope John Paul II, and the history of our time. <br />Not since Malachi Martin's &quot;The Keys of This Blood&quot; has there been a book that so meticulously traces and makes clear the global ambitions of the Catholic Papacy. Carl Bernstein's excellent reportage combines with the sometimes irritatingly unctious contributions of Italian journalist Marco Politi to write a book that is filled with so much high-drama and intrigue it is difficult at times to keep in mind that this is not a novel, but real life history being made right before our very eyes. <br />Perhaps the most compelling chapters in the book have to deal with how Karol Woytila as pope, conspired with Ronald Reagan and his Cabinet, which was virtually made up of all Catholics, to assit Poland's Solidarity movement, and hasten the demise of Communism.<br />This book copiously documents how the United States Government, together with organized labor, made common cause with the Vatican to conduct a modern-day Berlin airlift of sorts to keep Soldarity alive during the days of martial law in Poland. <br />This pope's purely political side is brought out for all the world to see. Not since Malichi Martin's book has there emerged a portrait of this pontiff which shows just how cunning, politically motivated, and hegemonistic he really is. John Paul II is portrayed as being a &quot;very important asset&quot; to our government. &quot;And what was in it for the pope,&quot; a deputy of Secretary of State Alexander Haig was asked. &quot;Something he probably wanted more than anything else...I think he is a very political man-what this gave him ...was that he felt he had a high-level intimate relationship with the world's most powerful country. He was a player. That's what it gave him.&quot;<br />In this book emerges a portrait of a pope that many people haven't seen, or do not believe exists, and that is the portrait of a man on a mission to establish worldwide, what has been established in his native Poland; a world dedicated to the Virgin Mary, governed under the auspices of the Roman Catholic Church.<br />A person would only have to review the history of Catholic absolutism in history, especially in the Dark or Middle Ages, and in the period from the 1870's to the Second World War to see how truly frightening this prospect is. This book clearly shows that John Paul II is the Deus Ex Machina in foreign affairs. This book is every bit as compelling as a novel.	2001-04-06

I am a teacher of children with mild to moderate specific learning disabilities who went through the teacher education program at Ashland University in Ohio. Like countless other teacher education programs, ours stressed only a &quot;whole-language&quot; model of instruction, to the exclusion of all others, especially those that stress explicit phonics instruction. <br />I bought this book at a symposium given by the International Dyslexia Association, and I am so thankful that I did. As a parent of elementary school-age children I needed to know the things in this book. Specifically...<br />*Why a book like this is necessary in the first place.<br />*What is this &quot;great debate&quot; that reading teachers, and educators keep talking about?<br />*How do children learn to read? Amazingly, this is not taught in many teacher education programs. Why? Because almost all of the research ever done on the issue, any research worth its weight in cotton candy points to the explicit teaching of phonics to be the way that most children learn to read. As the authors so beautifully, and succinctly point out &quot;The English written code is a sound symbol code, not a word symbol code. That is the game.&quot;<br />Parents of school-age children especially need to carefully read this book. Although I myself am a teacher, I believe in a &quot;parent as consumer&quot; focus in education, and, given this, caveat emptor! Parents need to know what they are getting in return for their hard earned tax dollars. <br />Please email me if you would like to continue this discussion.	2001-04-04

If you are the parent of a child with special needs, and she is a student n public school, be ready to do some big-time advocating to ensure that she gets the special ed. services she needs. As a special education teacher I am amazed at how little parents know about their rights under the IDEA '97 legislation, and how little they advocate for their child at IEP meetings. <br />This book is a good start to get you, as the parent-advocate, in the frame of mind you need to be in when &quot;negotiating the special education maze.&quot; My brief experience in the field has taught me that the most frustrated parents are those that are the least informed about what their rights are. Like trading stocks on the stock market, operating within the criminal justice system, or living in a foreign culture, the domain of special education has a culture, and rules all its own. If the parent does not know how to &quot;play the game,&quot; you will be rolled by school districts that pay a lot of lip-service to providing an &quot;education for all,&quot; but in practice are only concerned about the &quot;best and the brightest.&quot; <br />I would also highly recommend doing two things if you are a parent of a special needs child, and you are just about to enter &quot;the maze;&quot;<br />(1) I would look in your local phone directory for a special ed. advocacy group, or some type of parent group, where you can join with other parents and learn about the special ed. field, and what is available in your area.   (2) I would also join the Council for Exceptional Children as they are an excellent source of special ed. info. re: legislation, parent rights, advocacy, etc.    I hope that this review helps in inspiring you to become better informed about the &quot;system&quot; so that you can obtain the best for your child. I want to stress again how important it is to (a) become as informed as you can regarding your rights as a parent, and your child's rights to a free and appropriate publiceducation as stipulated by federal legislation such as IDEA '97. One of the frustrations I have had as a special ed. teacher is seeing how much lip-service school districts pay to special needs children, but how little is done for them in actual practice. I call special education &quot;the last bastion of discrimination in the public schools.&quot; I want to write a book about this some day and call it &quot;Separate and Unequal.&quot; ;)   And I also want to stress (b) how important it is to become actively involved in a local parent advocacy group. There is strength in numbers, and there are battle-scarred veterans of the special ed. wars who have had to go at it with recalcitrant school districts hammer-and-tong to get even the bare minimum services for their child. I don't mean to be &quot;negative,&quot; but I know what I am talking about.	2001-03-23

Richard Reeves' book is a welcome addition to the \\"Camelot Years\\" hagiographies that follwed the late President's death.. Written from the President's perspective,i.e. \\"a day in the life\\" type format, this excellent read is neither unctious, nor mean, but rather a balanced account of a Presidency that, until this point, has not been examined in an objective light.  <br /> <br />Reeves first person perspective shows a president who had more profile than courage. Inspite of his many gifts, JFK was diffident, at best, as President, in the areas of foreign affairs, and especially civil rights: Reeves quotes the President at one point saying \\"Can't you get your godd*mn friends of those buses?.\\" JFK was hardly the champion of the civil rights movement he was purported to be.  <br /> <br />Reeves book reveals a JFK that was maniacally driven to get to the White House, but once he got there was pretty much out of his league; JFK was an empty suit. The portrait of a neophyte statesman is obvious when Kennedy makes his first trip to Europe,receives a lukewarm reception from DeGaulle, and is taken to the woodshed by Nikita Khrushev who, upon seeing the youthful president exclaimed \\"he's younger than my own son.\\"  <br /> <br />Reeves' account beautifully illustrates how the rich playboy-president miscalculates Khrushev; one gets the impression that Kennedy felt that his Soviet counterpart could be rolled like a Boston Pol, that if he (JFK) could just talk to the Soviet Premier, surely they would come to some common ground. (This naiivete' continues to suffuse our debate on foreign affairs to this day.) Kennedy came away from his first overseas trip as president much chastened and humiliated. His woeful lack of understanding of the brutality of statesmanship was more than evident. I came away from reading this book with the impression that the learning curve for the presidency was too great for this ambitious man whose suit was not yet full.   <br /> <br />Richard Reeves'book isexcellent; well written, well researched, and balanced. I highly recommend it for its balance, scholarship and the valuable contribution it makes to Cold War history.  <br />	2001-03-22

She posits that to ignore that inner longing is to basically live in denial, and untrue to yourself. This incongruity, she argues, is the root of a great deal of dissatisfaction that people have with their lives.

I had to have this for my classroom!<br />I teach children with mild to moderate specific learning disabilities who need to regularly experience success in reading if they are ever going to become lifelong readers. What better way to foster desired literacy behaviors than using this delightful tale of an absentminded housepainter, his tidy, yet serious wife, their two children, and 12 performing penguins! <br />After reading this book, I thought that it would be ideal to use as the focus of a thematic unit on penguins. Believe it or not, there are many themes in the book that lend themselves to serious classroom discussion. For example, Mr. Popper daydreams of far-away places. There is the theme of daydreaming, why people daydream, as well as the theme of travel. Students could be asked to journal about their daydreams, as well as their hopes and dreams of visiting faraway places, which leads into a study of the geography and culture of other people. <br />In my 6th grade language arts class, I plan on focusing on the 17 different types of penguins there are, where they are found, some of their habits, as well as studying about polar exploration. Thanks to this timeless tale, I have a wealth information to use for exploration with my own class. <br />Mr. Popper's Penguins is a wonderful example of how a well written trade book can be used across the curriculum, to foster lifelong literacy habits, and broaden a child's horizon.	2000-10-13

But as many of you know, this is frequently not the case. Especially with ESL students,students from other than white, middle class, suburban backgrounds, and students with exceptionalities. This is where content area literacy methodology comes into play, and as a teacher, you play a crucial role in helping students interact with their texts in a way that helps the student make meaning. Interaction with the printed word is at the very heart of literacy.&quot; <br />This text contains a wealth of practical activities and strategies designed to foster content area literacy by assisting the teacher in scaffolding instruction so that all students can become knowledgable and profficient in developing their own learning strategies. <br />Although the book is a little &quot;pricey,&quot; in the end it is well worth the investment, because it is just that, an investment.

For you cannot properly appropriate by faith that which you do  not know. After reading this book, the holiness of God will not only be  clearer, but will also spark a burning in your heart for the Lord to  &quot;show me your glory.&quot;	2000-08-14

Martin posits that anyone who was under the age of 70 at the time this book was written would be alive to see the day when the nation-state, as we know it, would cease to exist. <br />What will be most surprising to most readers is how intimately involved the Papacy is in world politics, all for the purpose of establishing the Catholic Church as the One World Government. (See Revelation 13, 17).<br />Whether or not Pope John Paul II turns out to be the eventual ruler of the One World Order is irrelevant. Dr. Martin's book goes into exhaustive detail how this Pope, more than any of his predecessors in this century, has worked feverishly to keep the Vatican on the world stage as a major player. Karol Woytila has had a clear-eyed view of what the church's role should be in world affairs dating back to the time when he was a priest during the Second World War working undercover for the US Government. He learned well at the feet of the master in this regard; Stephen Cardinal Wysinzski took the young cleric under his wing during the formative years of his priesthood, and the account of his tutelage of Woytila is spellbinding.<br />Readers will be fascinated to learn just how much the Vatican was behind the fall of Communism in Eastern Europe, and just how closely the US and Vatican work on foreign policy issues.<br />This book could very well be subtitled \\"Prophecy Made Clear by Modern Events.\\" John Paul II is the \\"Servant of the Grand Design;\\" papal hegemonist ambitions are in plain view. A blockbuster!!<br />....	2000-08-11

While Christians are saved by grace;  &quot;solo gracia&quot; and by faith alone &quot;solo fide&quot; this in no  way exempts them from living a life of holiness.<br />Dr. MacArthur, through a  masterful illustration using numerous scripture references, shows how that  the grace that saves is an active, vibrant grace that is efficacious in the  life of the believer, that even though we are saved by &quot;faith  alone,&quot; it is not a &quot;faith that is alone.&quot; The Holy Spirit  is at work mightily within the life of the undeserving, hell-bound, but  redeemed person, &quot;to will and to work of His own good pleasure.&quot;  <br />Those that have trusted on human merit, a dry-eyed confession, and  simply walking an aisle to shake hands with a minister for a salvation  experience should read this book carefully and &quot;examine themselves to  see if they are in the faith.&quot; Dr. MacArthur's work will go a long way  in the edification of the Body of Christ, and combatting the rampant  apostasy regarding the study of salvation.	2000-08-11

This book is unlike any that I have ever read in that it puts the LORD in His rightful place; on the throne, high and lifted up,exalted.<br />RC Sproul has a wonderful grasp on the Holiness of God. This book is a must read for  any Christian who is serious about furthering his or her walk with the  Lord. Holiness is not a topic that is preached on, and that is unfortunate,  because the Bible tells us that without holiness &quot;no man shall see the  Lord.&quot; Dr. Sproul's work is compelling, yet easy to understand. I  highly recommend this book, and I am willing to discuss it in more detail,  so feel free to send me an email.	2000-07-30

Without a doubt, these things &quot;were not done in a corner,&quot; and Dr. Harrell gives an honest and objective portrayal about  a movement that is perhaps the least understood, and the least written  about. <br />He traces the beginning of the revival back to 1947 to the  movement of God in the ministry of an obscure evangelist from  Jeffersonville, Indiana named William Branham. One of the &quot;two  giants&quot; of the healing revival (the other being Oral Roberts), Rev.  Branham's ministry circled the globe 7 times bringing a message of  deliverance that seen countless thousands of healings, and has been cited  as the inspiration behind the ministies of Oral Roberts, and Tommy Osborne,  to name a few. <br />This book should leave no doubt in anyone's mind that  Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever.

For those who are simply  looking to &quot;make clean the outside of the cup,&quot; this book is not  for you. <br />But for those who are willing to &quot;forsake all,&quot; and  &quot;take up your cross daily&quot; to &quot;follow Him,&quot; this book  will bring you closer to God than you have ever been. A truly wonderful  work, mightily influenced by the Holy Spirit!	2000-07-22

Dr. Sowell uses erudition and brute logic to expose the sophistry and moral bankruptcy of liberalism. The first three chapters in which he sets forth just what the &quot;vision of the annointed is,&quot; along with just  what constitutes being &quot;rich&quot; or &quot;poor&quot; provide a  powerful discrediting of the basic tenets of leftists. He is at his best,  however, when he unmasks the intellectually dishonest way in which  statists, povertarians, and others who have a vested interest in  perpetuating &quot;the vision of the annointed&quot; utilize statistics to  further their agenda.<br />This book should be must reading for every college  student and anyone else interested in the future of America. A truly  outstanding read!	2000-07-21

Dr. Kissinger, for all of his hubris and arrogance will truly go down in history as a great statesman. His intimate and sometimes self-deprecating writing style will keep the reader at the edge of their seat especially  during the end of the Vietnam War and the crisis with Cyprus. All three  volumes could very well serve as textbooks for anyone interested in the  finer points of statecraft.	2000-06-09

As a student of international relations, if I had to recommend one book on understanding this sad and complex region, I would recommend &quot;The Balkans.&quot; Misha Glenny writes with an authority that comes with having  had a great deal of experience in the region. He eschews trite, simplistic  analysis by tracing the region's troubles through the history of the  Balkans involvement as a theater of intrigue for the great powers. An  enormously informative and captivating read.	2000-06-09
