At the end of \\"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix\\", J. K. Rowling left so many plot threads dangling that there was endless speculation about the next book. Who would be Voldemort's next victim? Would Harry get back together with Cho Chang or were they history? What about Ron and Hermione? Suspense enough to sustain interest at a fever pitch up to publication of the next book. Now that \\"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince\\" has finally been released to hype unseen in this reviewer's memory, we've found out that Rowling has not only tied up a lot of the dangling threads in OOP, but lets the reader know exactly where she's taking us in the final book, which may or may not be Harry's seventh year at Hogwarts.<br /><br />HPB opens on an unusually chill summer day which reflects the chill that has crept upon England's usually green and pleasant land. People are disappearing, presumed murdered. Unlikely \\"hurricanes\\" have taken a toll on the landscape. And one cold night in July, after Harry has been only two weeks back with the Dursleys, Albus Dumbledore, Hogwart's Headmaster, appears on the Dursley's doorstep to spirit Harry away to The Burrow to spend the rest of the summer with the Weasley family. Dumbledore isn't at all happy with the way the Dursleys have treated Harry all these years and he lets them know it in no uncertain terms. Just one more summer, he tells them, and Harry's out of there for good. It's hard to say who's more delighted by this news, Harry or the Dursleys.<br /><br />The chill over Muggledom is also evident in the wizarding world, even in the Weasleys' own home. Mrs. Weasley jumps at every strange noise in the night. The Weasleys' clock, with its nine hands representing family members indicating their location, always seem to be pointing at \\"mortal peril\\". And there have been changes in Diagon Alley as well. Florian Fortescue's ice cream parlor is boarded up because Fortescue has disappeared, along with old Ollivander the wand-maker. But the Weasley twins' joke shop is doing a booming business and the twins are raking in the Galleons by the bucketful. They even have their eye on expanding into Hogsmeade, right outside Hogwarts. And there's a new Minister of Magic as well; the bumbling Cornelius Fudge has been sacked. But the new Minister isn't much of an improvement; he's arresting innocent wizards right and left and throwing them into Azkaban prison, just for the sake of appearing to be making headway against Voldemort's followers. He also wants Harry to liaise with the ministry, but Harry isn't having it; he remembers all too well how the Ministry tried to slander him the year before and he isn't about to become their poster boy. He tells the Minister to his face to stuff it.<br /><br />Back at Hogwarts, there's a new staff member in the person of Professor Slughorn, a former Head of Slytherin House who has spent the past year in retirement and on the run from Voldemort who wants to recruit him into the infernal ranks of the Death Eaters. To everyone's shock, it's announced that Slughorn will be the new Potions master, replacing Snape, who has finally landed the plum job he's always coveted, the Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher. Is this Dumbledore's way of rewarding Snape for his loyalty over the past few years? Harry doesn't trust Snape around a glass corner and doesn't think he deserves it. But wait up -- the DADA appointment could be a very left-handed gift since no DADA professor has managed to keep the job for more than a year. Is this a set-up or what?<br /><br />Besides being immersed in classes, Harry is also meeting privately with Dumbledore, who tells him the entire history of Voldemort, his birth to a mother who is one of the last direct descendents of Salazar Slytherin now living in abject filth and poverty, and the handsome young local aristocrat who falls victim to her love potion; fatally, his mother, wanting his father to love her for herself alone, stopped giving him the potion and once his eyes and head cleared, he abandoned not only her but their unborn child as well. Recruited into Hogwarts by Dumbledore himself, honing his skills in magic and the dark arts, and feeding his propensities for cruelty, power and domination, Voldemort graduates from Hogwarts to seek revenge on the father who abandoned him by killing not only him but his paternal grandparents as well. And from there he becomes the Dark Lord, gathering adherents who are too fascinated or too terrified to resist his powers; among them, the Malfoy clan.<br /><br />Dumbledore tells Harry they must find the location of four of Voldemort's Horcruxes, objects that have been infused with the soul of their possessor. Voldemort is so evil and so obsessed with gaining immortality that he has split his soul into seven pieces, transferring six of them to six different objects and retaining the seventh piece inside his own body. Two of the Horcruxes have already been destroyed: one by Harry in the second book (Tom Riddle's diary), and another by Dumbledore, a black stone ring. Once they find and destroy the other four Horcruxes, they will be able to deal with Voldemort. But all kinds of things transpire in between.<br /><br />Harry is not only up to his ears in classes, he's also been named Quidditch captain for Gryffindor House, and he's fighting off hordes of girls who are fascinated by his hero status. The kids are growing up and flirtation and romance take up a significant part of this book. We always knew Ron and Hermione would finally become an item, but Hermione has to spend the better part of the year feeling jealous and shunted aside while Ron detours with a possessive airhead named Lavender Brown who has an infuriating habit of calling him \\"Won-Won\\" while sending him an outsize gold chain for Christmas that says \\"My Sweetheart\\". The more Ron tries to dump her, the tighter she holds on (going out with her is like dating the Giant Squid, he muses to Harry). There's a delightful interlude when Ron falls head over heels in love with one of Harry's groupies after drinking a love potion meant for Harry, with hilarious results. And almost too late, Harry finally wakes up to the fact that Ron's little sister Ginny has become a very desirable young lady, but not before Ginny has become entangled with Dean Thomas. Things get sorted out, and Harry and Ginny have a precious few weeks together until the darkness engulfs all of them and everything comes crashing down.<br /><br />It's Harry and Dumbledore's quest for the Horcruxes that triggers the tragedy that marks the last few chapters of the book. We know somebody very close to Harry is going to get killed but it's like a kick in the stomach when it actually happens. There's no safe place in the world for Harry any more, not even at Hogwarts. And there's no parent or parent figure to protect him any longer. He'll have to face Voldemort on his own. And he won't endanger Ginny by continuing a relationship with her; Voldemort gets to his enemies through the people they love best. He's completely alone. Well, maybe not completely; Ron and Hermione tell him they'll be with him no matter what happens. Maybe that's one of Harry's advantages over Voldemort; whereas Voldemort only has followers, Harry has friends.<br /><br />Harry has not only grown older, he's a lot more mature in this book. In OOP he was a querulous fifteen-year-old, touchy and irritable, resenting the bad hand life has dealt him; he didn't ask to be any hero and he didn't ask to have a homicidal wizard on his case. But in HBP he's moved through resentment to resignation to acceptance, and finally to readiness to accept his destiny. He's grown from boyhood to manhood and he's ready to shoulder a man's responsibility. He's going to find and destroy the Horcruxes and Voldemort as well. And anybody who gets in his way, as he intimates about the Half-Blood Prince, better watch out.<br /><br />Just has Harry has gone through some significantcharacter development, so has his opposite number, Draco Malfoy. We don't see much of Draco in HBP; he's disappearing from the scene for nefarious reasons of his own. At the start of the year he brags to his cohorts that he's moving on to bigger and better things; who needs Hogwarts any more? But Draco has bitten off considerably more than he can chew in selling his soul to Voldemort; we almost feel sorry for this scared kid who realizes with growing terror that he is in Voldemort's thrall for the rest of his life, immersed in evil he can't control, and that refusing or inability to do Voldemort's bidding will cost his parents their lives. And as we see Harry and Draco developing in different ways, we also see Dumbledore growing older and weaker, fatally undone by his own sense of goodness and decency and his misplaced trust in his nemesis, the Half-Blood Prince.<br /><br />So who is the Half-Blood Prince? Suffice to say it's someone with Voldemort's own background, hating and hiding his Muggle blood, biding his time for the ultimate act of betrayal. At the book's end, he's on the run, along with Draco Malfoy. But we have a feeling the Half-Blood Prince may be living on borrowed time; he'll get what's coming to him in Book 7.<br /><br />Unlike the end of OOP, where speculation about where the series was going abounded, by the end of HBP we pretty much know what's in store in Book 7. Harry, possibly with the help of Ron and Hermione, will go on a quest for the Horcruxes, and once they are destroyed, it will be a fight to the finish between Harry and Voldemort. Neither can live, we've been told, while the other survives. We can't know yet which will survive, or if Harry will realize his dream of becoming an Auror, or if he will finally settle down to find happiness with Ginny. All we know is that J. K.

And the series got off with a bang: \\"The Gunslinger\\" is really excellent; a tight, fast-paced, well-written little gem of a book without a wasted word in it.  Four thousand pages later, King finally brought his series to an end, and in comparison with the first book, the last is more like a big groan.<br /><br />Somewhere at the end of the fifth book, King thought it would be cute to inject his own name into the story.  This reader had hoped that King was having a bad day when he made that decision, and that he'd think better of it in the subsequent books.  But King obviously can't get enough of himself.  He's put so much of himself into the final volume that the reader starts to wonder if this series is about Steven King or Roland Deschain, or if King has reached the point where he can't tell the two of them apart any more.  Come on, Steve-O, if we want to know all about you, we'll read your bio.  This is Roland's book, not yours.  Do yourself and Roland a favor and fade to black.<br /><br />Leaving himself out would have cut a lot of unnecessary fat from the book, which brings us to the second problem with \\"The Dark Tower\\": King writes as if he's getting paid by the word.  The book is in dire need of a good pruning.  Somewhere underneath all this florid prose there might actually be a good story.  It's hard to find, though, covered as it is by all the verbiage.<br /><br />What was so bad about the bad guys, after all?  Randall Flagg was genuinely diabolical in \\"The Stand\\".  In this book he's more like a tiresome nuisance that King wants out of they way as expeditiously as possible.  And Mordred?  He's born into mid-world with all kinds of loathsome possibilities; he's taken out by a bullet, easy as pie.  And as for the Crimson King himself -- please, Steve, you can do better than that.  His ending is a joke.<br /><br />Unlike a lot of other reviewers, I genuinely liked the coda.  We sensed all along that the Dark Tower is the means to an end, not the end in itself, and this is neatly underscored by King using the opening sentence of \\"The Gunslinger\\" as the final sentence in \\"The Dark Tower\\".  Fortune's a wheel and the quest for the nexus of all space and time is never-ending.  As it should be.  Because once it's found, then what?<br /><br />So we've reached journey's end, and was it worth it?  For this reviewer, the series started off great, went slightly downhill with the next two books, picked up with the fourth, and took a precipitous slide with the fifth.  It seems to have paralleled the deterioration in the quality of King's other books.  The King who wrote great fiction like \\"Salem's Lot\\", \\"Pet Sematary\\" and \\"The Gunslinger\\" is not the same King who wrote \\"Dreamcatcher\\", \\"From a Buick 8\\" and \\"The Dark Tower\\".  I want the old King back.lot of other reviewers, I genuinely liked the coda.

It starts off simply enough; a doctor driving home is hit by something he can only describe as a \\"white blindness\\"; he can see nothing but an opaque whiteness.  Helped home by a \\"good samaritan\\" who steals his car (and is promptly stricken blind himself), the doctor visits an opthalmologist who in turn goes blind.  And so it goes, one after the other, until the whole city is affected.  The resulting chaos and descent into total anarchy is mind-blowing.  The early victims are quarantined inside a derelict mental institution with scant provisions for food and none for sanitation; they quickly become entrapped inside a nightmare of squalor, hunger and, for the women, sexual abuse.  When the blindness has hit everyone and there is no one left to enforce the quarantine, seven of the blind, led by the opthalmologist's wife, the one person in the city whose sight has been spared and who acts as the eyes of all the afflicted, emerge from the institution to find the nightmarish insanity repeated all over the city.  The final crushing blow is a church taken over by the blind victims who have managed to bandage the eyes of Christ, the Holy Virgin and all the saints -- is Saramago trying to tell us that God Himself has gone blind?  And one wonders: after emerging from this terrifying experience with their sight restored, will the former victims go back to business as usual, or will their ordeal have helped them gain some empathy towards each other?<br /><br />Saramago is not an easy read, and \\"Blindness\\" is not a book to be gulped down like an acture/adventure novel.  But it has an almost compelling immediacy; as horrified as you feel while you're engrossed in it, you can't stop turning the pages.  Reading it is a shattering, enervating, and yet ultimately cleansing experience.<br /><br />-- This review is dedicated to the memory of Bob Zeidler, a very special Amazon Friend.<br />Judy Lindng experience.    -- This review is dedicated to the memory of Bob Zeidler, a very special Amazon Friend.

It's lavishly photographed and nicely arranged, room by room, and there is even a ribbon marker attached.  It's all very stylish.  Where the book falls short is on substance.  Some of the photographs could use better captions to help make their statement, and a lot of what is being said is so self-evident as to hardly be worth filling up a book with.  One topic that does bear repeating (and is repeated in this book with a vengeance) is the necessity of de-cluttering your space -- go through your closets, drawers, cabinets regularly and toss whatever you haven't used in the last year or so.  You'll be surprised at how much junk you've accumulated.  There's also a shopping guide at the back, including internet addresses, listing sources.<br /><br />Speaking of space, this is really the book's weakest point: \\"The Organized Home\\" reads like it was written for readers living in suburban McMansions.  How many singles living in the city have laundry rooms, family rooms, storage rooms, or even separate dining rooms?  There needs to be a lot more in here about how to organize in a limited space.  The book talks about displaying all your small appliances if you have a lot of counter space in your kitchen, but what if you live in an apartment where the kitchen is so small that you can spread out your arms and touch walls?  Maybe that could be the topic for a separate book.  As far as this one is concerned, it's a beautiful volume, but its lack of attention to small spaces has limited its overall usefulness.	2004-10-10

There are a lot of books out there that purport to help you look good from head to foot, but of all the ones I've looked through, \\"Getting Gorgeous\\" is by far the best.  Lavishly illustrated and photographed, \\"Getting Gorgeous\\", unlike most other books on the subject, is as long on substance as it is on style.  There are chapters covering every beauty topic usually discussed, plus a couple the other books overlook, such as teeth and fragrance.  Each topic goes into depth, with a lot of \\"How-to\\" illustrations, a Q&A section, and recommendation of products that really work.  This last can be especially helpful to those who are confused by the sheer volume of beauty products out there and can't decide which to purchase.<br /><br />\\"Getting Gorgeous\\" uses photographs of some gorgeous people to make its statement; the subjects are all celebrities or professional models, but the book is all-inclusive in its focus on different ages and ethnic backgrounds.  Here, besides the usual 20-somethings, are Thandie Newton, radiant in her 30's, Candice Bergen, still drop-dead beautiful in her late 50's, and many other faces of varying ages and colors.  \\"Getting Gorgeous\\" doesn't promise the reader that she will look anything like them, but the reader is encouraged, after reading this book, to try new and different procedures that will help to make the most of what she has.  In terms of what you'll spend on beauty products, consider this book one of the best investments you'll ever make.	2004-10-10

In Lucas Corso, Arturo Perez-Reverte has created an appealingly unappealing hero. Corso is a book detective, whose job is tracking down rare volumes for discerning collectors who don't mind using Corso to do their dirty work. And this he does with gusto, for, after all, he's being well paid for it. Corso will betray his best friend or sell his grandmother for a copy of a rare volume if the price is right. Perez draws us into the world of rare books and book dealers so convincingly that we can almost breathe in the dust of incunabula that have lain undiscovered and untouched for centuries.<br /><br />This time around, Corso has a double job ahead -- he has to verify if the recently discovered, unpublished chapter of Alexandre Dumas' \\"The Three Musketeers\\" is genuine, and he also needs to determine if a copy of \\"The Book of the Nine Doors of the Kingdom of Shadows\\" is a forgery. \\"The Nine Doors\\", a volume written by Aristide Torchia which got him burned alive on the Campo Di Fiori near the end of the Inquisition, supposedly contains the secret of summoning the Devil up from Hell.<br /><br />It turns out there are only three copies of \\"The Nine Doors\\" left in the world; all the others were tossed onto the pyre along with their author. It's Corso's job to track them down and see if any, or all of them, are genuine or not. The secret may lie in the nine illustrations in each volume, conveniently reproduced for the reader in \\"The Club Dumas\\", and Perez-Reverte goes into great detail in showing the reader how the nine illustrations in each volume differ from each other. So which book is a fake, or are all of them fakes? Corso tracks down two of the volumes, but lo and behold, there's devil and all to pay -- each owner meets a nasty death, and somebody with murder on his mind is on Corso's own track. But Corso isn't a detective for nothing; he not only resolves the question of the authenticity of the chapter of the Dumas novel, he discovers that part of each of the three volumes of \\"The Nine Doors\\" holds the secret to calling up Beelzebub from the netherworld. Only in the right combination can this be achieved, and it's the owner of the third volume who turns out to have commissioned Corso's search, in order to have all the ingredients at hand.<br /><br />The book follows two story lines -- the attempt to verify the authenticity of the Dumas volume and the the search for the missing volume of the \\"Nine Doors\\", and the latter is vastly more interesting. In fact, the two separate plot lines appear to have little to do with each other because the story of the Dumas book is not nearly as well developed. Neither is character development one of Perez's strong points. The characters don't grow in this book; they just are. We see them less as personalities than as the jobs they have to do. But the story of the quest for the third volume of the \\"Nine Doors\\" is great fun, and the Perez-Reverte brings in more twists and convolutions than a Chinese puzzle; the book races along like a runaway freight train, but never careens out of control. For all the twist and turns, it knows where it's going, and carries the reader right along to the final page. And as Corso, the reader, and the unfortunate owner of the last volume of the \\"Nine Doors\\" all find out, everyone gets the devil he deserves.<br /><br />Judy Linds own track.

Born Rachel Shilsky in Virginia, where Jews were somewhat higher on the pecking order than Afro-Americans but lower down than Anglo-Saxon whites, a victim of sexual abuse by a father who despised his own wife, Rachel is a survivor; nothing sets her back for long.  Having cut herself off from her family by her marriage across racial and religious lines, Rachel proceeded to indoctrinate her sizeable brood of a dozen children with values both fundamental and timeless: work hard, study hard, if you don't study and learn, you are nobody.<br /><br />Rachel chose to deal with her children's bi-racial heritage by denying its importance, which may have helped her to deal with the rejection she faced from her own family, but didn't help her children to deal with the ambivalence every bi-racial child feels in a country that places as much emphasis on race as the United States, with a foot in each camp, belonging to both races and to neither.  When James asks his mother what color he is, she tells him he is the color of water; meaning that he is of all colors and none.  It was left to her children to work out this out for themselves, while Rachel provided the basics: love, guidance, and discipline.  And Rachel was assisted in this endeavor by her marriages to not one, but two strong black men, confident enough in their own identity to help Rachel raise her children to become solid, productive citizens.<br /><br />McBride charts his own journey to self-discovery and this book is as much about him as it is about his mother.  For this reviewer, one of his most telling observations was when he stated that growing up \\"deprived\\" in his day didn't have the connotations it has today: his family was \\"deprived\\" in the sense that they had limited financial means, but he and his siblings had two parents, an extended family, a church and a neighborhood that provided stability and guidance.  In a moving coda to the book, he describes his own foray into the Jewish half of his heritage when he participates in the Jewish wedding ceremony of one of his best friends.  What comes across most clearly in this book is the author's love and admiration for a very strong, resourceful woman.  \\"The Color of Water\\" is a moving, thoughtful memoir about growing up in a biracial and bicultural household and of the indomitable woman who headed it.  Very highly recommended.vided stability and guidance.

The book introduces us to some disaffected young men of the Spanish bourgeoisie, who play at being rebels and anarchists while they live off their parents' money. Among them are Tanger, a spaced-out cosmopolitan; Raul, a medical school drop-out drifting aimlessly; Luis, a venomous little bully who lies and steals from the parents he despises; Cortezar, a hanger-on; and David, a sensitive young wannabe poet who squanders his talent and his family's wealth while he devotedly tags along after his idol Agustin Mendoza, who alone has had the guts to reject his family's financial support while he ekes out a marginal living as an artist. Agustin's friend Ana, a child of the working class who bitterly hates the upper classes and everything they stand for, wants to make her own statement by killing a local politician. At Agustin's insistence, the young men are drawn into the plot. Here, Mendoza tells them, is your chance to put your money where your mouth is. Kill the politician, and prove you are men.<br /><br /> The plot involves murdering the politician and making it look like a robbery. Only one man will pull the trigger; the rest will be his lookouts. But who will do the honors? For all their big talk, none of them is ready to volunteer for the job. It's Luis's idea for all of them to play a round of poker; the losing hand must do the shooting. Fair enough. But Luis has his own hidden agenda; he thinks David is a coward, and he convinces Tanger, a card-shark from way back, to deal David a bad hand. David is stuck with the job. The big question is, can he go through with it?<br /><br /> Ana realizes the ultimate futility of trying to rely on these losers when she ruminates to herself, &quot;I'm surrounded by little boys playing at being men.&quot; But she and the rest of them have reckoned without Mendoza, who, unlike the others, has nothing to lose, and who is ready and able to take matters into his own hands if the deal goes down the wrong way. Agustin has no regard for human life; somebody is going to die.<br /><br /> &quot;Juegos de Manos&quot; is an interesting study of friendship, betrayal, and the futility of wasted life. This was Juan Goytisolo's first novel, written when he was 23 years old.

The first section is devoted to physiognomy, or reading faces; the second section is all about palmistry. As the book notes, the Chinese take a holistic approach to divination, in which all aspects of the face, body shape, posture and features, as well as the lines on one's palm, are seen to reflect the inner person and give an indication of character, personality and destiny. The first two chapters give a background in the beliefs and history of physiognomy, an ancient Chinese science (or is it an art?) going back at least 2000 years. As the authors state, Chinese physiognomy is not a game, but a highly complex belief system based on fundamental beliefs in Chinese, religion and culture, strongly influenced by Confucianism and Buddhism. The rest of the book is a fairly straightforward &quot;how to&quot;, giving basic instructions on how to read different features such as eyebrows, eyes, noses, mouths, ears, facial expressions, and hands. The illustrations for each type of feature seem to include not just Chinese but Western features as well; the reader may find himself peering into the mirror to try to read his or her own face, or to see how he or she may appear to other people. You may or may not take it seriously, according to your own belief system, but it sheds an interesting light on a facet of Chinese philosphy and culture that is probably unknown to most Western readers. It's an enjoyable learning experience.	2004-07-23

The locus of much of the action is Lightnin' Ed's Bar and Grill, presided over by Leo the bartender, a benevolent 300-pound Buddha who keeps with a pool cue behind the bar just in case, addicted to soap operas and the losing Phillies, fending off the perpetual advances of Big Betsy, an aging hooker way past her prime. Other regulars include Vanessa, a pretty young streetwalker wise beyond her years, her sister Leslie, bitter beyond her years, cheating on her devoted husband Rayburn who ekes out a marginal existence as a janitor and defends his honor with a razor; Leslie's paramour Leroy Briggs, the neighborhood bully (South Street is supposed to tremble when he walks), and Jake the wino, brilliant but wasted, dedicated to drinking himself to death. Brown gets to know all the denizens of Lightnin' Ed's as they get to know him, and the reader comes to respect him for being his own person, true to his own principles, beholden to no one and able to see the true value of a person behind the gritty facade.<br /><br /> Bradley evidently liked the characters he created, and even the bad guys like Leroy have their sympathetic side; we can see their vulnerability and pathos hidden behind the viciousness. He's also a master at dialogue, and some of the exchanges between the regulars at Lightnin' Ed's will have the reader on the floor laughing. &quot;South Street&quot; is very much an affirmative novel, because Bradley knows, and conveys to the reader, that behind all the dirt and the garbage and the crime statistics, the ghetto is made up mostly of decent people scrambling to eke out a living, warm and vibrant and full of the joy of life despite the odds. It's a story of men and women who &quot;keep on keepin' on&quot;.

I've read &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; so many times I can quote whole paragraphs by heart. So when I discovered Fanny Burney, a contemporary of Austen's, I couldn't wait to get into her books. &quot;Camilla&quot; is the second book by Burney I've read, and it's reinforced my initial impression that Burney is not up to Austen's caliber as a novelist. She tells an interesting story, but her characters seem too much like stock pieces acting on a stage, and the overly dramatic dialogue doesn't help matters much. Austen's genius was in not only telling a mesmerizing tale, but in bringing her characters so completely to life that they seem totally real. Austen's novels are of their own time and for all time; Burney's books are stuck rigidly in the late 18th and early 19th centuries.<br /><br /> A singular problem with &quot;Camilla&quot; is Camilla herself; she comes across more as a sweet but empty-headed ingenue, tripping from one mess to another and managing to make mountains out of molehills. Her younger sister Eugenia, crippled and disfigured with smallpox but well-read and profound, is a far more interesting figure, and if she had been the center of the book, it would have been a far more interesting book. By 600 pages we get kind of tired of Camilla's incessant mess-ups, and just wish she'd hurry up and marry Edgar and have done with it. As another reviewer stated, I would like to see &quot;Camilla&quot; brought to the screen; with the fat trimmed from the novel, a good script, and in the hands of a good director, it might be a better movie than a book. Taken on its own, &quot;Camilla&quot; is not a bad book at all; but there is no way it can stand up to Austen.	2004-07-23

Harold Bloom's story begins with an Aeon, Olam, descding to earth to bring two men, Valentinus, a reincarnation of a Gnostic prophet, and his young warrior escort Perscors, back to Lucifer on a quest to help Valentinus recover the call that motivated his previous life. For Perscors, the quest is a search for a transcendental principle, but to reach it, he has to do battle with enemies both divine and semi-divine, to finally reach his inner discovery of his own uniqueness.<br /><br /> If you're looking for an in-depth study of Gnosticism and other religions that flourished during the early Christian era, you'll be disappointed because you won't find it here. You'd be better off perusing Elaine Pagels' &quot;The Gnostic Gospels&quot;. But as an unusual adventure story, &quot;The Flight to Lucifer&quot; is interesting and absorbing. Bloom subtitled his book &quot;A Gnostic Fantasy&quot;, and on that level, it's a good read.	2004-07-21

An intrepid band of resourceful men and women, driven into hiding, have formed themselves into an outlaw army dedicated to restoring the rule of law and justice.  If this seems eerily like Robin Hood and his Merrie Men, forget about Sherwood Forest and look halfway around the globe: this story takes place in twelfth-century China.  Written by Shi Nai'an and Luo Guanzhong, and magnificently translated by Sidney Shapiro, &quot;Outlaws of the Marsh&quot; is a stirring tale about the struggles of common people standing up for themselves against an overpowering oppression.<br />Chinese history tells us that the outlaws of the Shantung Province marshes really existed; the story that comes down to us is based on their legendary exploits during the reign of the Sung emperor from 1101 to 1125.  Sidney Shapiro's translation, neither too formal nor overly colloquial, preserves the original vernacular and brings the book vividly to life, while preserving such typically Chinese features as the double-sentence chapter headings, and chapter endings telling the reader to &quot;Read the next chapter if you would know&quot; what is about to happen next.<br />The book is a rousing, old-fashioned action/adventure story, with lots of blood, gore, and battle scenes.  Sagacious Lu, Stumpy Tiger Wang, and the other marsh outlaws are no angels, any more than Robin Hood, Little John and the other Sherwood Forest gang were, but they represent the good guys as brothers in arms against a corrupt government.  &quot;Outlaws of the Marsh&quot; has been adapted into films, picture books, puppet shows, and at least one American novel called &quot;All Men are Brothers&quot; by Pearl S. Buck.  Children all over China know the heroes of this story by heart.  Sidney Shapiro gives us a great gift in bringing their exploits to the English-speaking world.	2004-07-19

As an aristocrat, she had strong notions of what constituted good manners and good taste.  At times she comes off as an insufferable snob, but her writing is redeemed by her lively sense of humor, her sharp perceptions and her wry intelligence that helped her to not take herself too seriously.  In an era of almost total male dominance, Shonagon's intelligence and wit was the equal of any man's, and her attitude toward men was competitive almost to in-your-face hostility; she was nobody's doormat.  She met men on her own terms and gave as good as she got.  On the other hand, her reverence for the royal family was so profound as to seem ludicrous; one has the sense she was ready to kiss the ground they walked on.  &quot;The Pillow Book&quot; is a compendium of autobiography, ideas, observations, lists (some of the most enchanting sections of the book are in her lists such as &quot;rare things&quot;, &quot;elegant things&quot; and &quot;unsuitable things&quot;), written in a style characterized by its crystalline simplicity.  Ivan Morris's excellent translation does full justice to this wonderful book.	2004-07-19

A killer is stalking the rainy streets of Vancouver, taking the lives of young women and leaving their heads behind.  Heads turn up everywhere -- floating downriver, buried in shallow graves, even nailed to the top of a totem pole on campus of the University of British Columbia.  Among the victims are a young drug addict, a collegian, and a nun.<br />It's hysteria time.  The RCMP launches a massive investigation, summoning up their crack detective, Robert LeClercq, to head a special investigation force.  But as LeClercq tries to get inside the murderer's head, he realizes there is a diabolical depravity operating here that he cannot hope to understand.<br />The book winds and meanders its way from the Canadian Northwest to the jungles of Ecuador and back via New Orleans, and while the plot sometimes becomes so convoluted that it seems to be getting hopelessly entangled, it always gets back on track in time.  This is a book for strong stomachs; there is some downright sickening stuff in here, but it doesn't overwhelm the narrative.

Supposedly this not only includes Jews, Muslims, Hindus, Buddhists, Zoroastrians, Baha'is, animists and every other non-Christian, it also throws in most Catholics, Unitarians, Episcopalians and mainline Protestants. The world is left cleansed of sin and sinners. Hallelujah!<br /><br />Such is the conclusion of \\"Glorious Appearing\\", the twelfth (and thank heavens the last) of the phenomenally successful \\"Left Behind\\" series. Jesus defeats His foes (every non-born-again Christian is counted in this category) and ushers in a whole new millenium of peace on earth. The only problem is, the new millenium is riding in on a tide of blood and gore. What kind of Jesus is this?<br /><br />The biggest problem with \\"Glorious Appearing\\" is that the Appearing isn't glorious at all; it's a holocaust of blood. \\"Jesus merely raised one hand a few inches,\\" say Jenkins and LaHaye in the sophomoric prose that is typical throughout this book, \\"and... they tumbled in, howling and screeching.\\" Hoo-boy! Yay for our side! But better is to come: humans and horses are, in Jenkins/LaHaye's deathless words, \\"splayed and filleted\\" (it rhymes!) like so much meat on a rack. Question: why kill off the horses? Who did the horses sin against? Or were they at fault for carrying sinners? Should they have known they were sinners and bucked them off?<br /><br />You've got the general idea by this time: I loathe this book. Imagine if it had been written by a Muslim fundamentalist, preferably from Saudi Arabia, who has Allah causing a ghastly holocaust that killed off every non-Muslim on the planet. Christians everywhere would be outraged. As they should also be by this book. Whatever Jesus Jenkins and LaHaye portray on these pages, it isn't the Jesus of the New Testament. The Jesus of the New Testament is the God of Love. The Jesus of \\"Glorious Appearing\\" is some kind of murdering Moloch. This is not the Jesus I learned about in Sunday school, nor is it one I'd ever acknowledge as the Saviour of mankind.<br /><br /> Would Jesus have condemned the Good Samaritan to Hell because he wasn't a Christian? Or Buddha? Or Socrates? Instead of promoting tolerance and understanding, the book preaches hate and intolerance. Bow down and worship Jesus the right way, or by God, you'll end up \\"splayed and filleted\\".

It's especially impressive that Dickey, a man, was able to tell his story from the POV of the betrayed wife, and make it sound totally convincing.  No mean feat.<br />\\"The Other Woman\\" brings us a young African-American woman (the book wraps us up so totally from the first page that we don't realize until the end that we never learn her name) who supposedly has it all, or most of it -- a prestige job as a news editor, a '64 Mustang and a handsome husband named Charles.  She works nights and holidays; he works days as a middle school teacher, and they're too busy to have a family.  But she's totally devoted to him, when she has time from her job, and he's devoted to her, or so she thinks.  But a message from an unknown individual named David Lawrence blows her complacency to smithereens: he tells her their respective spouses have been cheating on them both.<br />Shocked and furious, the wife confronts Charles, who admits it all but says it's over.  But she doesn't believe him, and David isn't about to let it go.  His manhood has been insulted, and he's out for blood.  Charles and Jessica, David's wife, a phys ed teacher at Charles's school, have been careless enough to leave all the sordid details in e-mails and instant messages; he hacks into Jessica's account, prints out the evidence, and everything hits the fan.  Meanwhile, Charles' wife is about to show him that two can play at this dirty game, and the mess replicates exponentially.<br />Dickey is completely convincing in showing us the pain and confusion of the wife, and also the shame and conniving of Charles, the headstrong cluelessness of Jessica, and David's rage and lust for revenge.  It's hard to determine who is the more contemptible -- Charles, who leaves Jessica hemorrhaging in a hotel room following a miscarriage while he runs home to his wife in a state of denial; or David, who sends the evidence of Charles's and Jessica's affair to their co-workers, students and the students' parents, effectively destroying both their careers.  Jessica, meanwhile, is a pathetic individual, thinking she's found her soulmate in Charles and brought up cruelly short.  And the book's very title, \\"The Other Woman\\", makes us wonder who actually is the other woman -- the wife thinks Jessica is the other woman, until she herself becomes the other woman, and Jessica accuses David of being so wrapped up in his career and neglecting her in the process, that his job is the other woman.  How the whole mess gets sorted out in the end, I'm not saying -- suffice to say that messes like this one leave their sorry residue around to taint every life they touch.<br />\\"The Other Woman\\" is a riveting novel of sex, betrayal, marriage, friendship, and how lies and deception can undo it all.

At the center of the book is Hester Prynne, a young wife in puritan New England, trapped in a loveless marriage with a man old enough to be her father, sent ahead of him to the new world while he takes care of business in the old.  But before he can join her, she falls in love and into an affair, and nine months later, the result is born for all to see.  In colonial New England, where religion controls every aspect of everyone's life, Hester and her lover have committed a horrendous crime, never mind a sin, for which they could both be executed; the powers that be feel they are being lenient with her by condemning her to wear a scarlet letter A, for adultery, prominently displayed on her clothes.  Hester shocks the whole village by embroidering the scarlet letter with gold thread and wearing it like a badge of honor.  Is this her way of spitting into the eye of the village, or is she making her public dishonor deliberately more shameful as a penance?<br />And who is Hester's lover?  The village demands he show himself; Hester, out of pity, love, or contempt, or more probably a mixture of all three, isn't saying.  We know early on it's the reverend Dimmesdale, a young preacher beloved and respected by all, but if he doesn't have the courage to come forth himself, Hester will keep his secret.  The story isn't a whodunit, who done it is obvious almost from the beginning.  The book is about love vs. lust, courage vs. cowardice, and the hypocrisy of public piety covering up a shameful secret.  Reverend Dimmesdale can flagellate himself all he wants in private; we can't help but feel contempt for him for not having the guts to share Hester's public humiliation.<br />But as bad as things are for Hester and Dimmesdale, they are about to get infinitely worse with the appearance of Hester's husband, Roger Chillingsworth, who arrives in the new world to find he has been cuckolded by his wife, who has given birth to another man's child, and wants his honor avenged.<br />Hawthorne tells a compelling tale which captures our imagination as much as it did when it was written.  We realize these star-crossed lovers don't stand a chance in the uptight society they lived in.  The book moves slowly, but in doing so it gives the reader time to think about the timeless issues of love, betrayal, deception, and the social mores that controlled the protagonists lives.  Hawthorne raised plenty of questions; the readers will find their own answers.help but feel contempt for him for not having the guts to share Hester's public humiliation.<br />But as bad as things are for Hester and Dimmesdale, they are about to get infinitely worse with the appearance of Hester's husband, Roger Chillingsworth, who arrives in the new world to find he has been cuckolded by his wife, who has given birth to another man's child, and wants his honor avenged.   <br />Hawthorne tells a compelling tale which captures our imagination as much as it did when it was written.

In &quot;Eaters of the Dead&quot; (an unfortunate title if there ever was one), Crichton introduces us to Ibn Fadlan, the story's narrator, a young Arabian who has had the misfortune to capture the heart of the young and beautiful wife of a rich old merchant.  Ibn Fadlan is unwillingly sent out of harm's way on a mission to the faraway kingdom of Saqaliba. En route to his destination, he meets a group of Scandinavians, led by a brawny warrior called Buliwyf (the ancient spelling of Beowulf?).  Ibn Fadlan thinks the Scandinavians are beyond gross; their habits are disgusting, they're little more civilized than animals -- but he finds an affinity with Buliwyf who can communicate in the common currency of the Latin language, still alive in the 10th century when this story takes place.  Buliwyf convinces Ibn Fadlan to come with him and his men to Scandinavia, where they are being terrorized by a mysterious and monstrous entity that emerges from the mists and leave carnage and bloodshed in their wake.<br />In &quot;Beowulf&quot; this entity was, of course, Grendel, but in &quot;Eaters of the Dead&quot; the monster turns out to be a group of cannibalistic Neanderthals who sow terror everywhere they appear, and with good reason.  As in &quot;Beowulf&quot;, there is a battle to the finish in which only one side can survive.  During Ibn Fadlan's stay in the Scandinavian village, while preparing for the final confrontation, he learns a lot about his new friends and discovers that, while they may not be as cultured as his Arabian kinfolks, they are far from being the barbarians the first appeared to be.<br />Ibn Fadlan tells us his story as entries in a journal, each one more fascinating than the next, and the ending reads like a journal broken off, for reasons we never find out.  The last words are &quot;Now it happened that...&quot;  What happened?  Crichton's genius as a storyteller is leaving us wanting to know more about this Arabian world-traveler and what kind of subsequent adventures he met up with before he returned home -- if he ever did.<br />Crichton, whose interests seem to be encyclopedic, based this book on a real manuscript by an Arab traveller called ibn Fadlan who in the year 921 A.D. traveled from Arabia to Bulgaria as an emissary of the Caliph.  The manuscript is available in several modern translations, including English, but Crichton's book is probably a lot more fun to read.  &quot;Eaters of the Dead&quot; was a sleeper, originally published in hardcover (I still have my copy) but it didn't take off until years later, after the release of the film &quot;The Thirteenth Warrior&quot; with Antonio Banderas playing the protagonist.

The manuscript is available in several modern translations, including English, but Crichton's book is probably a lot more fun to read.  &quot;Eaters of the Dead&quot; was a sleeper, originally published in hardcover (I still have my copy) but it didn't take off until years later, after the release of the film &quot;The Thirteenth Warrior&quot; with Antonio Banderas playing the protagonist.  In making two ancient cultures come alive for the reader, Crichton shows himself again to be a master storyteller.	2004-06-06

Edward Pierce, a master con artist, wants to hijack 12,000 pounds sterling that is being sent by rail to fund the Crimean War.  It won't be easy.  The money is locked in a safe, made triple-strong, with four keys, each key stored in a different location.  All four keys must be found and copied without raising any suspicion.  It's a task that would daunt all but the most capable.  Fortunately, Pierce is more than up to the job.  He's got several things going for him: a razor-sharp intelligence, nerves of steel, patience, cunning, and not least of all, his mysterious mistress, Miss Miriam.  Pierce and his confederates spend a year working on their plans.  But things have a habit of going awry at the damndest times.  Can they pull it off?  Maybe.  Can they get away with it?  Hmmm....<br />Michael Crichton has written a humdinger of a period suspense novel with telling touches that bring us right into the middle of the Victoria era.  For instance, just finding a key in a Victorian living room could be a week-long search, given how cluttered the average living room was at that time.  And train travel, still fairly new, was the object almost of worship.  A train robbery was infinitely worse than, say, robbing a bank.  Who would have the unmitigated gall to rob a train?  Well, Pierce would, for one.  And why would he commit such a dastardly crime?  Because, as Pierce explained, as if talking to a three year old, he wanted the money.<br />As in his fiction books, Crichton's research into Victorian London and train travel is solid, and the book has a sense of unquestionable authenticity.  One gets the feeling Crichton had a lot of fun writing it.  We see a lot of Crichton himself in Pierce: his intelligence, his wit, his painstaking attention to detail.  The book scores both as a good novel and well-researched social history.  It's one of Crichton's best.	2004-06-05

The kids will love it.  What preschooler doesn't love dinosaurs?  One trip to the American Museum of Natural History in New York City had my son, at age three and a half, talking a blue streak about stegosauruses, elasmosauruses, tyrannosauruses, and Heaven knows what else.  \\"The Big Book of Dinosaurs\\" is organized into categories such as meat-eaters, boneheads (pachycephalosaurus and his ilk) and gargantuans such as brontosaurus.  The double-page spreads with gorgeously illustrated dinosaurs are sure to hold a child's attention, and the text is succint and easy for them to understand.  It's a great read-aloud book for the preschool to first grade set.  There's a very good index at the end of the book with proper pronunciations of all the dinosaur names that will have your preschool paleontologist rattling them off like a pro. Highly recommended for all children between three and six.	2004-06-04

A sampling of some of the topics covered in this volume are the misuse of common English words; the overuse of cliches; the plurals dilemma, and the Great Pronoun Problem (I'm always confused about whether to use \\"that\\" or \\"which\\").  O'Conner points out that some of the biggest grammatical blunders have resulted from trying to be too correct, such as the classic misuse of subject for object pronouns.  Remember your fourth grade teacher admonishing that one should always say \\"Tom and I\\", never \\"Tom and me\\"? which lead to such common bloopers as \\"She gave the book to Tom and I\\".  (To see how much sense this doesn't make, take out the \\"Tom and\\" and see what's left.)  Along with explaining the rules, O'Conner emphasizes that a dose of common sense helps matters considerably.  I remember my fifth grade grammar teacher, an old battle-axe who used to scare the daylights out of us, laying down the law that one must never, ever, ever end a sentence with a preposition.  This used to lead to all kinds of convoluted messes, which undoubtedly engendered Winston Churchill's classic protest statement, \\"This is the sort of English up with which I will not put.\\"  The book's title is a sly kick at the perils of grammatical over-correctness: it should actually be \\"Woe Am I\\", but that just wouldn't sound right.  Perhaps the greatest strength of the English language is its flexibility; some rules were made to be bent.  O'Conner's book helps to shed some light on how far rules can be bent before they are broken.	2004-06-03

Even the name of this little book is an absurdity in itself: \\"Oxymoronica\\"??  Reading this volume helps us to stop and think about some of the gems and malapropisms that have enlivened the English language, both planned and unplanned.  Here you'll find some of the more classic Berra-isms and the wit and wisdom of Shakespeare, Aristotle, and Confucius, just to name a few.  The book is well organized into different areas of life such as politics, art, romance and sex (some of the more delicious examples of oxymoronica fall into this category), marriage and literature.  The book makes you reminisce on some of the choicer oxymorons of your own experience; one of my favorites came from a lawyer friend of mine, who, hearing that an upcoming court hearing was being delayed because the judge-from-hell was ill, said \\"Gee, I hope it's nothing trivial.\\"  \\"Oxymoronica\\" is full of hilarious examples that match or top that one.  Its wisdom should be absorbed slowly, savored bit by delicious bit.  To use a classic oxymoron, it's a terribly funny book.	2004-05-28

Even before Bram Stoker penned his classic horror novel, vampires were the stuff of lore and legend, guaranteed to scare the pants off people: evil bloodsucking monsters without souls or morals, looking to recruit innocent victims into their unholy ranks.  Almost every country in Europe had its own vampire stories.  But it was Stoker's &quot;Dracula&quot; that unleashed the widespread popularity of vampire tales and novels that has continued unabated.<br />This anthology includes vampire stories from 1816 (a fragment of a novel by Lord Byron) to 1984.  Even Ole Drac himself makes a reappearance in Bram Stoker's &quot;Dracula's Guest&quot;, a self-contained chapter initially written as part of &quot;Dracula&quot; but omitted to shorten the novel to its current length.  Some modern-day gems include &quot;Pages From a Young Girl's Journal&quot; by Robert Aickman, in which a bored and lonely teenage girl meets her demon lover and eagerly awaits her passage into the ranks of the Undead, and &quot;Bite-Me-Not&quot; by Tanith Lee, a beguiling combination of love story and horror tale.  The one glaring omission in this otherwise fine compendium is Stephen King's short story &quot;One For the Road&quot;, in which Salem's Lot is revisited with calamitous results.  I would have given this book five stars if it had been included here.  There is also an appendix of selected vampire novels and vampire films.  There are enough good, shivery reads in here to satisfy the most insatiable fan of vampire literature.  Lock the doors, turn up the lights, and enjoy the fun.	2004-05-26

The shock of witnessing her parents' horrible deaths wreaks mental and emotional havoc on Doll that sets her up as one of the victims of the Salem witch-hunts.  In an era when mental illness was often seen as being possessed by devils, and anyone possessed by demons must therefore be in league with them, Doll doesn't stand a chance.  Forbes writes her book in the style of a 17th-century text and evokes both the time and the place so accurately that we feel we have been transported back to colonial times.  Forbes manages to steer clear of any moralizing tone, and lets her story tell itself; her understated tone conveys a powerful message of a young girl destroyed by the combined forces of ignorance and prejudice.  Reading this book, one realizes who was really doing the devil's work in Salem.	2004-05-26

As one who was taught grammar the old-fashioned way by diagramming sentences in the fifth grade, I cringe every time I see such gems as \\"Every dog has it's day\\", signs advertising \\"apple's\\" and \\"orange's\\", the interminable misuse of their, there and they're, people acting like they never heard of past participles (a sign in a community center near my office exhorts the kids to \\"Stay strong, stay focus\\"), and the confusion of words that sound alike but mean totally different things, such as residents and residence.  Do residence live in the residents?  Believe it or not, I've actually seen this written.<br />One wonders if they actually teach grammar in the schools any more.  Given some of the notes I've read written by teachers to parents, it's doubtful.  I've seen teachers whose own grammar skills were so poor they wouldn't recognize the most flagrant grammatical errors if they were written in letters four inches high.  So Lynne Truss's book is long overdue for the hordes (not hoards) of the grammar-impaired.  (Yes, simply moving or omitting a comma can totally change the meaning of a sentence.  Try these three: \\"Eats, shoots and leaves\\"; \\"Eats shoots and leaves\\", and \\"Eats shoots, and leaves\\".)<br />The book is short, concise and very much to the point.  Unfortunately, it will probably be read and enjoyed only by those who already get the joke in the title.	2004-05-26
US	52477572	R33UG8KG6PYE1I	067940581X	569473707	Emma (Everyman's Library)	Books	4	5	6	N	N	Austen's comedy of errors	&quot;Emma&quot; has been called Jane Austen's most flawed heroine, but I'd rather reserve that title for Fanny Price of &quot;Mansfield Park&quot;, whose very &quot;perfection&quot; makes her one of the most obnoxious inventions of British literature.  How can one stand a hero or heroine who is never, ever wrong?  We'd rather have someone like Emma, who, for all her flaws, or maybe because of them, is a delightful creature.  She's a hopeless busybody, meddling and interfering in everyone's lives, too much the lady of the manor for her own good; but she means nothing but everyone else's good.  Unlike Austen's other heroines who are barely in the leisure class like Elizabeth Bennet or one step away from poverty like Fanny Price, Emma Woodhouse is comfortably well-off; she doesn't need a husband to support her because she'll inherit a fortune from her widowed father, so she's free to cheerfully attempt to marry everybody else off according to her own inclinations.  And her main project is her friend Harriet, the child of an unknown father (an enormous social stigma in early 19th-century England), whom she attempts to pair off with a snooty, social-climbing vicar, unable to see the damage she is doing to both.  Fresh from one blunder, Emma races headlong into another, and yet another, until you want to yank her chain and bring her up short.  And she almost undoes her own self when the man she realizes she has loved all along, her neighbor Mr. Knightley, begins to see potential in Harriet himself.<br />We know the mess is going to get sorted out sooner or later; Austen has a genius for untangling messes and getting everybody back on the right track, but it's fun to watch Emma racing from one hairbrained scheme to the next and getting caught in the traps of her own devising.  And we like her none the less for it.  Because Emma, wrongheaded as she often is, doesn't have a mean bone in her body.  She genuinely wishes everyone well, even though it's on her terms.  It takes an older, wiser and more experienced head like Knightley's to help her see the error of her ways.  Knightley is the perfect foil for Emma, with a wit and intelligence as sharp as her own, but providing maturity and stability to balance her free-floating exuberance.<br />&quot;Emma&quot; is not Austen's best work; just as Emma is a somewhat airheaded creature, &quot;Emma&quot; lacks the depth of Austen's later books such as &quot;Mansfield Park&quot; and &quot;Persuasion&quot;.  Emma, along with Elinor Dashwood and Elizabeth Bennet, is one of my three favorite Austen heroines, but Emma lacks the insight and maturity of the other two.  Too often acts without thinking, but it's just this quality that makes her so endearing at times, even while it makes her so aggravating.  Emma is probably Austen's most humanly fallible heroine, and maybe that's why we like her so much.

The mystery of the two small nephews of Richard III of England, supposedly murdered on his orders, has become the stuff of British history.  Richard has come down to us as an evil monarch, most notably through Shakespeare's eponymous drama and the writings of Thomas More.  But Shakespeare wrote his play based on More's book, and More was hardly a reliable eyewitness to events, being only five years old when they happened.  In this highly original novel, Josephine Tey explores the mystery of whodunit from the point of view of a fictional detective, Alan Grant, laid up from a bad fall and bored out of his gourd; Grant tackles the problem from the cui bono standpoint, namely, who benefitted most from the young princes' murder?  It surely wasn't Richard, who probably had more to lose than to gain from their deaths; but it did benefit the one whom Tey strongly suspects did have the princes put out of the way, one who had no legitimate claim to the crown at all.  Grant and his young American research associate, Brent Carradine, work out the puzzle step by step, coming to a conclusion that satisfies them both.  Whether or not it will satisfy the reader will depend on if the reader can let go of some preconceptions that have become engraved in stone.  Grant asks himself, can 400,000 history books be wrong?  They probably can, given that history is written by the winners, and Richard III ended his days as one of history's major losers.  If Richard was indeed innocent, then whoever is guilty of having the princes murdered had everything to gain from traducing Richard's reputation to secure his own place in history and on the British throne.  Tey's book is a well-written, engaging detective novel shedding light in some of the darker corners of the history of the kings of Britain.	2004-05-08

From there we follow the course of these six people's lives, hour by hour, as the darkness descended while the mushroom cloud rose, and all around them was nothing but death and destruction.  One reads this slender book at a single sitting, unable to put it down, and emerges shell-shocked, with a single question going around and around in one's head: &quot;Why?&quot;<br />John Hersey's account of the explosion of the atomic bomb over Hiroshima stands as a classic of wartime reporting.  He doesn't editorialize or sensationalize; he lets the six people mentioned above tell their own stories; and through them, the horror of what was unleashed on August 6.  The apocalyptic destruction of lives and property was mind-blowing.  And after living through the nightmare of the blast, the survivors of the bombing had to cope with the long-term effects of radiation sickness.<br />The question of &quot;Why?&quot; still haunts us almost 60 years later.  Was the bombing necessary?  What better options did Truman have?  The answer may be, none.  A full-scale invasion of Japan, which would almost certainly have occurred if the bombing had not taken place, or if it had not been as devastatingly effective as it was, was estimated to cost a million American casualties, and probably many more Japanese casualties as well.  Was it a question of committing a horrendous act in order to avoid a worse one?  Probably.  We've learned from history that all too often, the choice is not between good and bad, but between bad, worse, and unspeakable.<br />The original version of &quot;Hiroshima&quot;, published the year after the war ended, left the profiles of six lives in suspension.  The updated edition includes Hersey's 1985 article on the lives of the six survivors forty years later.  We learn that, after suffering through so much in the immediate aftermath of the bombing, the &quot;hibakusha&quot; (the Japanese term for the Hiroshima survivors) had to put up with prejudice and discrimination from non-hibakusha who shunned them because they were subject to so many illnesses.  Even so, these six, along with thousands of others, managed to get on with what was left of their lives.  One finishes this book with a sense almost of awe at the resilience of these six very ordinary people who could be any six people in our own country.  And even as we get a sick feeling that somewhere out there, some madman would love to push the nuclear button and unleash a holocaust that would make Hiroshima look like a walk in the park, we feel a deep sense of resolve never to let anything like this happen again, anywhere, at any time.devastatingly effective as it was, was estimated to cost a million American casualties, and probably many more Japanese casualties as well.

Cosby's book reads much like his stand-up comedy, but there is so much down-home common sense in these pages that the reader can relate to much of what is written and is reminded of his or her own childhood.  Reading this book, it was rather reassuring to find that I wasn't the only mother who threatened to introduce her child to the joys of time-travel (Mrs. Cosby to obnoxious child: &#34;I'm gonna knock you into the middle of next week&#34;), and Cosby reminded me of my own dad banging on the door to my room during my teens when I jacked up the rock 'n' roll station, bellowing through the wall to &#34;TURN THAT CRAP DOWN!&#34;  Cosby also provides some back-up for parents who have reached the conclusion that sometimes the best reason you can give to your child who demands to know why he or she can't do this or that, is &#34;because I said so.&#34;<br /><br />Cosby takes parents on a tour of parenting from pregnancy through the teen years, with sound observations on developmental quirks at each stage of childhood.  He's not one of those parents who forget as soon as they become parents, what it was like to be a youngster.  Listen to Cosby's alarm at his daughter wanting to spend the day hanging around the mall:  &#34;He (the father) knows exactly what those boys at the mall have in their depraved little minds because he once owned such a depraved little mind himself. In fact, if he thinks enough about the plans that he used to have for young girls, he might even run over to the mall and have a few of those boys arrested.&#34;<br /><br />Cosby inherited his parenting skills from his mom and dad, who raised their own children back in the day when parents were presumed to know more about their own kids than a whole army of child psychiatrists and psychologists.  His parents stood for no nonsense (after Cosby broke a glass table playing parlor basketball, his mother entered with a stick and threatened to &#34;bust him in half&#34;; Dad, his nose buried in a book, asks Mom, &#34;Why would you want twice as many?&#34;) but they taught their kids good manners, pride and self-respect, values Cosby takes seriously.  He's not averse to a good swat on the rear end if the situation calls for it but in general he emphasizes reasonable discipline leavened with good will and humor.<br /><br />Cosby strongly believes parents are parents first and friends second, but he's no tyrant.  As he says toward the end of the book, he and his wife and children &#34;have the kind of mutual trust that I wish the United Nations had.  And, with breaks for a little hollering, we smile a lot.&#34;  There is probably no better definition of good parenting.<br /><br />Judy Lindplaying parlor basketball, his mother entered with a stick and threatened to &#34;bust him in half&#34;; Dad, his nose buried in a book, asks Mom, &#34;Why would you want twice as many?&#34;) but they taught their kids good manners, pride and self-respect, values Cosby takes seriously.

Ray is fun to watch on her show; she's perky and down-to-earth and doesn't make cooking seem like some kind of exalted rite that intimidates beginners who haven't progressed beyond Boiling Water 101.  Her bouncy exuberance comes across in her book and makes it enjoyable to read.  I especially like the way her book is organized; there are special sections on Top Ten Meals With Fewer Than Ten Ingredients, Top Ten All-Time Favorites from her TV show, 30-minute pastas, salads and veggies, make your own take-out (pizza, sandwiches and Tex-Mex), burger recipes, Asian flavor, comfort food, and her own family favorites.<br />Can all of these meals actually be made in 30 minutes?  Well, unless you're as well-organized as Ray on her show with everything right at hand, slicing and dicing up a storm, probably not; but none of them should take more than 45 minutes and some of them really can be made from start to finish in half an hour.  Her book is pretty heavy on pastas, which are typically quick to prepare, and if the Asian isn't 100% authentic, it's still fun to make and delicious to eat. Ray's instructions are simple and direct, easy for anyone to follow.  What's more, none of the meals are difficult to prepare and all of them emphasize healthy eating.  This is a great book for anyone who enjoys good eats without all the hassles that go into preparing them.  Grab it and hit the kitchen.	2004-05-02

The greatest detective in all of literature is between the covers of this excellent edition of the complete stories of Sherlock Holmes.  Of all the editions out currently out there, the Doubleday hardcover version is by far the best.  With 1122 pages, it's a hefty tome, but packed between the covers, in an edition that won't give you eye-strain to read, are all four full-length novels and fifty-six short stories, plus an excellent introduction by Christopher Morley.  This is the version to get.<br />There has never been anything quite like Sherlock Holmes; he's in a class by himself.  We meet him first in his late twenties, just starting a career as the world's only consulting detective, when he's introduced to his invaluable chronicler Dr. Watson.  What is Holmes without Watson?  He's not nearly as interesting alone; Watson is an absolute necessity.  Holmes needs Watson's obtuseness as a foil for his own razor-sharp brilliance.  In some of the later volumes, Holmes narrates a couple of his own cases.  They fall flatter than a pancake.  Let Holmes stick to what he knows; we must have Watson to show him to best effect.<br />There are so many great stories included in this volume that probably no two people's list of personal favorites will match; my own are &quot;The Red-Headed League&quot; and &quot;The Copper Beeches&quot; from &quot;The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot;; &quot;The Yellow Face&quot;, &quot;The Naval Treaty&quot; and &quot;The Final Problem&quot; from &quot;Memoirs&quot;, &quot;The Adventure of Charles Augustus Milverton&quot; and &quot;The Second Stain&quot; from &quot;The Return&quot;, and &quot;His Last Bow&quot; from the volume of the same title.  The incomparable &quot;Hound of the Baskervilles&quot; rates as my favorite long novel.

One summer day, Robin finds a lost puppy and names him Ruff, hoping to keep him, but his insufferably stuffy aunt Isabel not only refuses to let the dog stay, she plans to have it \\"disposed of\\" in the morning.  Robin isn't sure what she means by \\"disposed of\\", and he's not about to wait around to find out.  Rescuing the dog in the dead of night, Robin and Ruff run away to hide themselves in the anonymity of London.  After a misadventure with a would-be thief, they are rescued by a man named John Heminges, an actor at the Globe Theater whose company happens to include, among other people, an already famous playwright named William Shakespeare.<br /><br />Heminges takes Robin and Ruff to his home for a night's sanctuary, but their stay extends through the whole of the winter of 1596-97, as Robin makes himself indispensible to the household and is accepted as an apprentice into the Queen's Company.  Among the actors, we meet Shakespeare himself, Heminges, Richard Burbage, Will Kempe, and other giants of the Elizabethan stage, rehearsing a new play in which Robin is given a bit part, about a pair of star-crossed lovers named Romeo and Juliet.<br /><br />In \\"The Wonderful Winter\\", Marchette Chute gives us a fascinating, true-to-life tour of Elizabethan London and the inner workings of the Elizabethan theater.  We get to know the actors not only as artists but as people.  We learn how a play is put together from its conception in the mind of the playwright to its first performance.  Robin is a delightful invention, but the actors in the story were all real, and Chute invests them with a vitality that makes them people we wish we had known personally.  \\"The Wonderful Winter\\" is a great introduction for young people to the literary genius of Shakespeare and the world he lived in.

King tossed a lit firecracker into the audience on Oprah's TV show when he talked frankly and honestly about black men living on the down low: supposedly straight men who sleep with other men but refuse to acknowledge they are gay or bisexual.  The audience's visceral reaction told how King had hit a nerve.  In this book, King talks straight-up about the pressures on black men to \\"be a man\\" and the deep-rooted homophobia in the black community that not only encourages, but practically forces men to keep any homosexual desires or activity deep undercover.<br /><br />King is up front about his own experience living on the down low and urges women to be careful in choosing their partners.  Well and good, but looking at King's own example, how are women able to tell who's living on the down low and who isn't?  The danger to the wives and girlfriends of these men, as King explains, is that the men are so deep in denial they refuse to practice safe sex with other men, because that would mean admitting they have sex with other men, and the denial goes so deep that the men constantly lie to themselves about their own sexual activity.  The soaring HIV rate among black women who were infected by black men living on the down low is terrifying proof of how this problem has impacted on the African-American community.  I've personally known two women who died of AIDS after being infected by men living on the down low whom they thought they could trust -- one by her live-in partner; the other by her husband.<br /><br />King himself is sending a mixed message; on the one hand, he is forthright about the extent of the problem and the need for women to protect themselves; on the other, even as he acknowledges he has been part of the problem, he gives no indication that he is going to cease and desist, or even practice safe sex with his female partners to protect them against possible infection.  It's almost as if he were saying, \\"Ladies, here I am; play at your own risk.\\"  But I'll give King his props for being honest about his own behavior, and how the problem of men living on the down low has put millions of women at risk.  As the book emphasizes, it's up to every woman to take steps to protect herself, because, in the end, nobody is going to look out for you but you.<br /><br />Judy Lindg his props for being honest about his own behavior, and how the problem of men living on the down low has put millions of women at risk.

Capote wanted to create a new form of writing which he termed the \\"non-fiction novel\\": a work of historical or contemporary fact writting in the form of a novel.  To an extent, he succeeded.  Rather than a dry recitation of the story of a multiple murder, \\"In Cold Blood\\" sweeps us up in the narrative much as a good work of fiction does.  Except the events in this book are all too real.<br />Capote tells us the story of the Clutter family murders in the small town of Holcomb, Kansas in 1959 from all angles: the Clutters themselves, the lowlife killers Dick Hickock and Perry Smith, and the detectives of the Kansas Bureau of Investigation who brought them to justice.  We meet the Clutters first: Herb Clutter, a pillar of the community and his sensitive wife Bonnie, suffering from bouts of depression; and their two children, the popular, outgoing Nancy and the introverted Kenyon.  Then there are Smith and Hickock, two small-town, small-time criminals who hit the big time in one horrendous night when they murder the entire Clutter family.  And there is the KBI team that followed each slender lead to bring them to justice.<br />Capote's narrative of the trial which lead to the conviction and execution of Hickock and Smith is as fascinating as his telling of the events which lead to their capture.  We can attempt to understand what drove Smith to kill, growing up in a chaotic family; Hickock is more of an enigma.  Capote presents the senior Hickocks as two caring and conscientious parents whose son rejected the principles they tried to instill in him.  Can good parents raise a bad kid?  Certainly the Hickocks did.  Smith at least had a conscience, something Hickock never bothered about.  Did they deserve to die for their crime?  Capote seems to have been leaning against the death penalty in general.  He emphasizes that the judge chose the strictest possible interpretation of the mental incapacity statues which might have applied to Perry Smith.  The conclusion of the trial was almost foregone; the detectives had carefully built an airtight case.  Hickock and Smith end up on the gallows.<br />The book's ending is a wistful scene between the leading KBI investigator and Nancy's best friend, Susan, now a young woman entering college; just such a young woman, Capote says, that Nancy might have been had she lived to grow up.  In that final scene, we see, as Capote meant us to see, the waste of six lives -- the Clutters, and the killers' own.ation of the mental incapacity statues which might have applied to Perry Smith.

Located in the middle of Bedford-Stuyvesant, the 77th was notorious during the 1970s for being a precinct gone mad with corruption and venality.  The cops were so out of control that they were more criminal than the criminals they were supposed to be chasing and arresting; lying on the witness stand and sabotaging their own prosecutions (grilled by a defense attorney on the actions of a defendant one cop had arrested for supposedly dealing drugs in his presence, the cop breaks down and yells \\"How the hell do I know? I wasn't even there!\\"), and robbing not only drug dealers but the people they are supposed to protect.  At times the mayhem gets so over the top that it's hysterical.  Example: one cop throws a suspect through a plate glass window, steps through the window, hauls the suspect to his feet, points to the broken window and tells him he's under arrest for \\"breaking and exiting\\".<br /><br />Mike McAlary, at the time an investigative reporter for New York Newsday, wrote the articles that helped break the scandal in the 77th wide open, from which this book was derived.  McAlary tells the story from the perspective of one rogue cop, Henry Winter, who started out as an honest cop but then tried to be a \\"tough cop\\" and began to take the law into his own hands.  So Winter was banished to the 77th Precinct -- then known as \\"the Alamo\\" -- a dumping ground for cops with bad records.  In such an environment, Winter's bad tendencies flourished like a weed in a hothouse.  Soon he was part of an elite gang of criminal cops who held up crack dealers in broad daylight and confiscated their money and supplies (later re-selling the drugs for their own profit) and acted as if they were a law unto themselves.<br /><br />We learn what happens when Winter was finally caught; under a promise of immunity from prosecution, he and his partner consented to wear a wire and set up a sting operation to catch other bad cops.  One of the most incredible cases in the 77th involved a female cop whose father was a respected police sergeant; caught on tape offering to rent her shield to a drug dealer, she was tried and sentenced to four years in prison.  After thirteen indicted cops were tried, Winter walked free, but his own career ended in disgrace.  And Winter himself got off easy.  Most of the indicted cops went to jail and one of them, Brian O'Regan, unable to face the prospect of prison, committed suicide.<br /><br />Reading this book brought back the \\"Alamo scandal\\" in all its immediacy; living in New York City, I remembered the days after the appearance of the McAlary articles in \\"Newsday\\" when people were shaking their heads in disgust and respect for the NYPD plummeted to an all-time low.  As the commander of the detective squad, the only unit in the 77th that was untouched by the scandal, told McAlary, \\"The kids are yelling at us in the street now.  They're saying, 'Hey officer, can you sell us some crack?'\\"<br /><br />\\"Buddy Boys\\" is not only an excellent account of one bad cop, but it provides a stomach-turning picture of a culture of lawlessness in a place where the lines between integrity, greed, law and venality have become so blurred that they are almost indistinguishable.  McAlary is not only a great reporter but an excellent writer.

Even in their own lifetime, the Brontes were a source of fascination and speculation.  Lucasta Miller does a very good job of portraying the myths that grew up around the three sisters, and showing us the reality behind the legends.<br />To an extent, the myths were perpetrated by the Brontes themselves, as a defense against the public reaction to their extraordinary books.  Already in 1857, Elizabeth Gaskell's \\"Life of Charlotte Bronte\\" told the public about the sisters' lives, much as Charlotte herself wanted it presented.  \\"Jane Eyre\\" was a shocking book for its time; women weren't supposed to have such strong sexual feelings, let alone write about them.  Charlotte developed, and helped perpetrate the myth of the sisters as quiet, mousy types, martyrs to duty and family, beset by tragedy at every turn.  Charlotte was not only a great writer; she was a master at presenting herself the way she wanted others to see her.<br />I have a real problem with this books lack of proportionate attention given to the two younger sisters.  Miller's assessment of Emily is much briefer than the space she gives to Charlotte, and about Anne she says almost nothing at all.  Anne has always been the \\"forgotten Bronte\\"; most people who have grown up with \\"Jane Eyre\\" and \\"Wuthering Heights\\" have never read anything Anne wrote.  But \\"The Tenant of Wildfell Hall\\" is every bit as compelling as the books of her better known sisters, and gives evidence that behind the quiet face she showed to the world, Anne may have been every bit as much a strong personality as Jane and Emily.<br />Generally, Miller is a strong biographer and shows us the Bronte sisters as they probably really were: vibrant individuals living full, all-too-short lives.  The sisters she presents here are women who were really capable of writing the turbulently emotional, romantic novels that have endured as classics of English literature.ovels that have endured as classics of English literature.	2004-04-28

It's intriguing to wonder who among the British aristocracy was being sent up in this volume.<br /><br />\\"The Edwardians\\" is a book of manners and morals during the last years of a decadent, decorative, and very inbred upper class.  The characters live a life of total self-indulgence, waste and spiritual emptiness.  The story focuses on the dukedom of Chevron and its 19 year old heir Sebastian, attracted to and repelled by the society he was born into and takes for granted; his selfish, predatory mother, Lucy, a legendary hostess who is as shallow and superficial as she is popular; and his sensitive, introspective sister Viola, considered an ugly duckling by her mother at seventeen.  Into their lives comes a polar explorer named Leonard Anquetil, temporarily lionized by society, who sees \\"society\\" for the fraud it is and tries to open the young people's eyes.<br /><br />But as drawn to Anquetil as Sebastian finds himself, he is also drawn in the opposite direction, heading into his first adult relationship with one of his mother's married friends, Lady Roehampton, of a certain age but still drop-dead gorgeous.  Self-knowledge and discovery can wait; Sebastian is launched into society through a clandestine affair with Lady Roehampton, which, as Anquetil predicts, will be the first of many such empty, meaningless liaisons.  Is this all there is to a life in which one's every wish is granted?  Sebastian realizes how soul-deadening such a life can become eventually and after a few years he wants out; but just as he appears resigned to his gilt-edged fate, Anquetil resurfaces.  Who knows where Sebastian's life will go from there?  As Anquetil tells him, it's up to Sebastian to decide his own destiny.  And decide -- for better or worse -- he does.<br /><br />Sackville-West has a talent for characterization; we see all the youthful conflict in Sebastian, the heady excitement of Lady Roehampton as she flings herself into what may well be her last affair before age catches up with her; and the shallowness of Sebastian's mother, the duchess, who must surround herself with and endless procession of people and parties to cover the vast chasm of internal emptiness that is her own life.  But Sackville-West is herself torn in two directions.  On the one hand, she appears to share Anquetil's disgust at the false facade of high society; on the other, she shares that society's contempt of middle-class values and virtues.  She can't have it both ways, and it's this very conflict that gives \\"The Edwardians\\" so much of its tension and interest.

Books	4	23	26	N	N	A solidly researched history of the Spanish conquest	William Prescott's &quot;History of the Conquest of Mexico&quot; and &quot;History of the Conquest of Peru&quot; are brought together in one volume that provides a solidly researched and detailed account of the Spanish conquest of the Americas.  The first volume, describing the Mexican conquest, is the better of the two.  In the first chapters, Prescott describes the life and culture of the native Mexican tribes, concentrating on the dominant Aztecs, their religion, customs, achievements in literature, astronomy, agriculture and mechanical arts, and discusses the infighting among the various native princes that set them up for a fall when the Spanish conquistadores landed in the New World.  Prescott writes about the efforts of Bartolom&eacute; de las Casas to protect the natives from slavery and how this was rejected on the specious grounds that the Indians had to be brought into contact with the Spaniards in order to be converted to Christianity and slavery was the only way to achieve this end.  Prescott describes the conquest of the Caribbean islands of Cuba, Santo Domingo and San Juan de Puerto Rico (as it was then known) as a precursor of the conquest of the Mexican mainland, and how some Indians like Montezuma thought the Spaniards were there for their benefit, whereas others, like Xicotencatl, the Tlascalan chief, were suspicious of the Spaniards' motives from the beginning and tried to unite the native tribes against them.  The Noche Triste, brought on by the arrogance and cruelty of the Spanish captain Pedro de Alvarado, is described in such detail that the reader is totally caught up in the narrative.  One finishes this volume filled with admiration at Prescott as an historian and a writer, and regretting what a great civilization was destroyed out of pure greed and lust for gold.<br />&quot;The History of the Conquest of Peru&quot; is as well-written and detailed as the first volume, but it seemed a little drier to this reader, possibly because I was already familiar with the history and culture of the Incas from reading the &quot;Comentarios Reales&quot; of the Inca Garcilaso de la Vega, the son of a Spanish father and an Incan princess.  Prescott gives several pages to Garcilaso's talents as a historian, which he doesn't think much of; he notes that Garcilaso, writing as a spokesman for his defeated countrymen, painted a picture of Incan civilization that bordered on the panegyric.  But Prescott quotes from Garcilaso here and there throughout his own book.  Prescott presents the history of the Pizarro brothers' march through Peru, the defeat of the Incas and the death of Atahualpa, all in scrupulously researched detail.  The Pizarros comes across as much less sympathetic figures than Cortes; while Cortes was able to appreciate the humanity of the native Mexicans, and tried to rein in some of his more rapacious captains, Alvarado among them, the Pizarro brothers and their captains, notably Carbajal and Almagro, seemed to be trying to outdo each other in cruelty.  We end up feeling nothing but disgust for the avarice and ambition of these people, and the devastating effect it had on the native civilizations that were unfortunate enough to be in their way.<br />Prescott wrote his history over two hundred years ago and it's still the gold standard of early Latin American historiography.  Taken as a whole, the volumes present a panoramic view of the clash of cultures that continues to reverberate to this day throughout Central and South America.  Prescott is a vivid narrator and an excellent storyteller; his account grabs the reader early and sweeps you along from the first page to the last.

Prescott presents the history of the Pizarro brothers' march through Peru, the defeat of the Incas and the death of Atahualpa, all in scrupulously researched detail.  The Pizarros comes across as much less sympathetic figures than Cortes; while Cortes was able to appreciate the humanity of the native Mexicans, and tried to rein in some of his more rapacious captains, Alvarado among them, the Pizarro brothers and their captains, notably Carbajal and Almagro, seemed to be trying to outdo each other in cruelty.  We end up feeling nothing but disgust for the avarice and ambition of these people, and the devastating effect it had on the native civilizations that were unfortunate enough to be in their way.<br />Prescott wrote his history over two hundred years ago and it's still the gold standard of early Latin American historiography.  Taken as a whole, the volumes present a panoramic view of the clash of cultures that continues to reverberate to this day throughout Central and South America.  Prescott is a vivid narrator and an excellent storyteller; his account grabs the reader early and sweeps you along from the first page to the last.  It's a terrific read and a grand tour through two lost civilizations.	2004-04-18

As Michael Olmert shows us, books became one of the world's most powerful means of disseminating information and entertainment.  Can anybody imagine life without books?<br />We learn how books developed from the papyrus and parchment rolls of the Egyptians and Greeks to the Roman codex, which transformed the book into the shape we know today, and how &quot;people of the Book&quot; -- Christians, Jews and Muslims, produced glorious volumes meant to teach the word of God.  But these masterpieces were made by hand, every word and every stitch; they weren't for the the great unwashed masses.  The Middle Ages, with their gloriously illuminated religious tomes sandwiched between jeweled covers that were worth a prince's ransom, turned out books that were museum pieces; some more famous examples of illumination were the &quot;Tres Riches Heures of Jean Duc of Berry&quot;, and the Irish &quot;Book of Kells&quot;.  The spread of handwritten books for keeping accounts made possible the development and spread of commerce during the Renaissance.  But the Gutenberg revolution, the development of movable type, brought books down from the rarefied atmosphere of prized possessions for the rich alone, and made books and the dissemination of knowledge and information available to everyone.<br />Olmert relates in detail how books were made, the development of different typefaces, and writes two fascinating chapters on the crafts of bookmaking and bookbinding. There are also chapters on the role of illustration in books by etching and engraving as well as drawing and painting, and how illustrations in texts were used to teach as well as embellish.  There's a nice chapter on children's books and how picture books progressed from the woodcuts of the 17th century to &quot;Where the Wild Things Are&quot; in our own time.  And a whole chapter is devoted to what Olmert considers the most important book ever written, and no, it's not the Bible -- it's the dictionary.<br />Olmert ends with the observation of the timeless of books.  There is no &quot;sell-by&quot; date on any book, he tell us, because every book can tell future generations something about us.  In a way, we are the sum of what we read.<br />Books are so much a part of life now that they are available to everyone everywhere, from rare book sellers to the online supermarket to the corner newspaper store, and at every price from zillions of dollars for museum masterpieces to a few dollars for throwaway paperbacks.  Only one kind of book is missing from this excellent volume and that is the development of the e-book.  Olmert may not have seen it coming, as his book was published in 1992, but it's hard to see how scrolling through e-books will ever replace the fun of turning pages.

On the night of the dragon boat races in Poo-Yang district, the drummer of the boat favored to win the race collapses; turns out he's been poisoned.  Judge Dee is called in to investigate, and finds out he has not one murder on his hands, but a whole string of deaths involving a missing domino, a malevolent river goddess, and the theft of the Emperor's Pearl, still unsolved after a hundred years.  With the help of his trusty seargeant Hoong Liang and a lady wrestler named Violet Liang (no relation), Judge Dee unravels the tangled mess and puts everything to rights.<br />Unlike the classic Chinese detective novel which reveals in the beginning whodunit and focuses instead on how the crime was solved, &quot;The Emperor's Pearl&quot; is more like a contemporary novel in which we have to wait for the end for the resolution.  There are some interesting plot twists and turns and enough surprises to satisfy the most diehard mystery fan.  It's too bad Van Gulik didn't bring back the formidable Violet Liang in a subsequent novel; she's a delightful invention who's worth a book all by herself.	2004-04-05

Now he suffers from increasingly frequent episodes of psychomotor epilepsy during which he explodes in violence.  A hospital team has developed a treatment that they think may help him: by implanting electrodes in his brain, they can short-circuit a seizure before it starts and prevent the violent episodes.  But Dr. Janet Ross, Benson's psychiatrist, and her mentor, Dr. Manon, have serious reservations.  Benson's psychosis has caused him have a morbid dread that machines are taking over the world.  Having a micro-computer implanted into his brain may cause him to feel that the doctors have turned him into a machine.  Harry isn't going to like that.  And when Harry is upset, all kinds of unpleasant things can happen.<br />In &quot;The Terminal Man&quot;, Crichton explores a theme was the focus of his later best-seller &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;: just because a scientific experiment can be done doesn't mean it should be.  The doctors at Benson's hospital are gung-ho over this experiment; they've been looking for a subject to test it out on and Benson seems perfect.  But Benson isn't a laboratory rat; he's highly intelligent and learns how to control the micro-computer implanted in his brain cells until soon he's having almost continuous stimulations.  At this point, he tips over, and the ensuing mayhem proves that Ross's worst fears were more than justified.<br />&quot;The Terminal Man&quot; suffers from Crichton's trademark lack of characterization; his characters are cardboard cutouts who don't really engage us; we aren't interested in them as people.  But he's one helluva storyteller, and he knows how to explain scientific complexities to lay readers in terms that make the whole thing comprehensible.  (I've always thought Crichton would make a great high school science teacher for that very reason.)  His annotated bibliography at the end of the book includes thirty-six references for further reading in psychomotor epilepsy, and six for electronics.  Well, most of Crichton's readers aren't neurosurgeons or rocket scientists, we're just looking for a good book that holds our interest; and on this score, Crichton delivers.complexities to lay readers in terms that make the whole thing comprehensible.

Who doesn't love dinosaurs?  So when you hit a winning ticket, you exploit it for all you're worth, right?  Well, yes and no.  Crichton had a good idea for a sequel but he doesn't do it the justice it deserved.  There was no reason to bring Malcolm back; his turning up alive after being pronounced dead was just plain lame.  I suspect Crichton was tired of Grant/Sattler and wanted to go with a new team.  But the idea of a secret island where the real work of Jurassic Park was carried out is pretty good; after Jurassic Park was abandoned, what became of all those leftover critters?  Malcolm's new team proposes to go in and find out.  As usual, the dinosaurs save the book; the plot is contrived in spots; the characterizations, except for the two youngsters, Arby and Kelly, are flat and uninteresting for the most part, but the dinosaurs fascinate us by just being dinosaurs.  Especially compelling is Crichton's description of the raptor pack which has grown to young adulthood without adult modeling; bred from a test tube, they had no parents to provide an example for social existence, and the result, as Crichton shows us, is a pack of unsocialized predators living in a world in which only the strongest and most vicious survived and all the others died.  In such a world, nothing is going to survive very long; once they've eaten all their prey, they'll turn around and eat each other.  The writing in general has a somewhat hurried quality, as if Crichton just wanted to bang this sequel out and get it over with before moving on to something else.  But even with its flaws, Crichton still knows how to engage the reader's attention.  &quot;The Lost World&quot; doesn't measure up to its predecessor by a long shot, but it's still a pretty good read.	2004-04-04

At the moment, Khadija is &quot;the most negotiable piece of property&quot; Omar and his wife possess, and he's arranged her marriage to a middle-aged neighbor for a good price.  (He's already married off his older daughter, Fatna, so he's all set.)  But unfortunately Khadija is kidnapped by a rascally vagabond and raped, and Omar is furious that his investment has sunk to zero value.  A girl who is no longer a virgin is unmarriageable, and if she has no marriage value, she is worthless.  So Omar has to shop around for another husband for Khadija, and this is going to take some fancy finagling.  Bribes and payola have to be distributed here and there, Khadija has to be re-virginized so the family can put on a proper face, the wedding banquet must be planned, Fatna has a spat with her husband and runs home in a snit, and all this is fuel for the running commentary of some very snoopy neighbors.  How all this confusion gets sorted out is somewhat mind-boggling for a Westerner accustomed to making arrangements without paying off fifty intermediaries or caring what the neighbors have to say, but as Omar sagely observes with a shrug, &quot;Europeans -- what do they understand?&quot;<br />Jane Kramer may have been a Western observer, but she clearly has sympathy for her Moroccan neighbors, and a nice sense of humor besides.  Omar is a likeable rogue trying to salvage his family's honor and his daughter's future, and somehow manages to do just that.  Kramer is a keen observer of her environment and her description of the wedding ceremony brings us right into the middle of the festivities.  It's an enjoyable read, and paints an engaging and sympathetic portrait of a very likeable, if somewhat perplexing, Moroccan family.ikeable, if somewhat perplexing, Moroccan family.	2004-04-03
US	52477572	R39262ICVEUT0J	0354163000	841771550	Promise	Books	4	17	18	N	N	Not one of Buck's best, but eminently readable	&quot;The Promise&quot; like all Buck's books I have read that are set in China, gives a compelling portrait of the country and its people.  Set during the early years of World War II when the Japanese army was pounding the Burma Road, &quot;The Promise&quot; relates the story of a brave division of Chinese who have been sent on a suicide mission to rescue the remnants of an Anglo-American force trapped in Burma.  There are a couple of telling portraits of Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek and his wife that show them in all their venality; their remoteness from the individual masses of Chinese arouses more contempt than admiration.  What really affects the reader is the disdain of the Anglo soldiers toward the Chinese who attempt to rescue them and whom, in their desperation to escape from the Japanese, they abandon to their fate, cutting off their retreat and leaving them to save themselves.  The open contempt the English express towards the native Burmese (&quot;We own this country, after all; it's part of our Empire&quot;), and their genuine puzzlement when the Chinese confront them about their attitudes, shows up all too clearly their inherent sense of superiority which is based on nothing but a blind ethnocentricism.  Buck's sympathies clearly lie with the valiant Chinese who are seething under a viciously brutal Japanese occupation and longing for freedom, but not at the price of European domination.  We don't get to know her characters in &quot;The Promise&quot; as intimately as in some of her other books, but we admire them none the less for their courage and their self-sacrifice.  &quot;The Promise&quot; is not on a par with &quot;The Good Earth&quot; or &quot;The Three Daughters of Madame Liang&quot;, but it's definitely a worthwhile read.	2004-03-26

John Barry's exhaustive study of the great flu pandemic of 1918 is an excellently researched account of the deadliest attack of a killer virus that ever hit the planet.  As Barry states, 24 million people have died of AIDS in the past 20 years; the flu virus of 1918 killed at least twice that many people in 20 weeks.  The book is overlong; I would have preferred less information about the bios of the men involved in fighting the pandemic and investigating its cause, and more on the human side of the catastrophe; more individual vignettes would have illustrated the toll the pandemic took on ordinary people in this country and around the world; but the narrative is stark enough.  The account of how the flu swept through the army camps, decimating the numbers of young men about to be sent off to fight in World War I, is mind-blowing; even more so is how the disease attacked remote locations outside the United States and left ghost towns in its wake.  Barry mentions that the flu spared those cities and towns in America that took the most stringent isolation precautions, and this could have been developed more in anticipation of another visitation of a deadly pandemic.  Because Barry states without hesitation that sooner or later it will happen again, and the implications are devastating.  The 1918 flu pandemic occurred in an age before jet travel; how fast would it spread in our own time?  The socio/legal problems of quarantine and isolation are enormous, and yet they may -- will -- have to be faced.  The prospect of a return of another killer flu virus makes one realize just how defenseless we are against an airborne plague.  One can pretty much avoid HIV by good luck and careful practices, but nobody can stop breathing and survive.	2004-03-24

It's an invaluable companion book for the HP series but it stands very well on its own.  Those who already have David Colbert's \\"Magical Worlds of Harry Potter\\" may want to add this book to their library; it covers a lot of areas the Colbert book doesn't and it's more comprehensive.  Written in the form of a mini-encyclopedia covering everything from Amulets to Zombies, \\"The Sorcerer's Companion\\" provides links to the first four HP books (it was written two years before HP5 was published) with notations for easy reference. (Check out PA 8/154 for mention of Grindylows -- PA being \\"Prisoner of Azkaban\\", and 8/154 being the chapter and the page number of the American edition.)  We learn that there are many kinds of Divination (ever heard of Astragalomancy? It's a fancy term for throwing dice) and the difference between amulets and talismans, along with a zillion other delicious tidbits of information.  Want to know just what a Hinkypunk is?  Or what the study of Arithmancy (the bane of Hermione's existence) involves?  Did you know that the Kappa is a Japanese demon which loves cucumbers and the best way to keep it off is to placate it by feeding it kappamaki sushi?  (Okay, I admit that one sounds a tad farfetched, but hey, it's all in fun.)  It's not necessary to go through this book from A to Z; you can browse through it however you like and still come up with a bounty of entertainment and information, as well as practical advice on how to read tea-leaves (maybe you'll do better at this than Harry and Ron who couldn't see anything in the leaves but a big mushy mess), where to find a basilisk (guess what? there really is a basilisk lizard) and how to rid your premises of goblins.  The book is a browser's delight -- fun and educational at the same time.  Enjoy!	2004-03-24

Austen's heroine, Catherine Morland, has read a few too many such books, and we meet her at the age of seventeen, emerging from the chrysalis of adolescence as a passably pretty young woman with her head full of romantic notions and not much else.  When she meets the hero of her dreams, Henry Tilney, a surprisingly level-headed young man, Catherine realizes that life as melodrama is a poor second to life in reality.  Catherine is fascinated at the prospect of visiting Northanger Abbey -- what mysteries and horrors must be waiting to be discovered -- only to be brought up short by the pedestrian intrusion of real life (a locked cabinet which might have held vials of poison or, even better, a skeleton, turns out to hold nothing more dangerous than a laundry list).<br />&quot;Northanger Abbey&quot; is a good first novel but it is by no means Jane Austen's best, and Catherine is not as interesting a heroine as Elizabeth Bennet, Emma Watson or Elinor Dashwood; she's a somewhat shallow, undeveloped young lady who lacks their depth and their intelligence.  But she's a likeable heroine; unlike Fanny Price, Catherine doesn't try to be perfect nor judge others for failing to be so, and unlike Emma Watson, she's not meddling in everyone else's business.  She can admit when she's at fault and she has a generous spirit.  We like to imagine her as the tomboy Austen pictures her in her childhood, rolling down hills and chasing her brothers and sisters.  Austen provided a number of interesting supporting characters: Henry's amiable sister Elinor, his insufferably snobbish and narrow-minded father General Tilney, and the artful, heartless flirt Isabella Thorpe.  By the book's end, Catherine has grown up a bit; she sees life as it is and realizes Henry's steady common sense is infinitely preferable to the histrionics of any Gothic hero.  Jane Austen's first book was a promising introduction of better things to come.provided a number of interesting supporting characters: Henry's amiable sister Elinor, his insufferably snobbish and narrow-minded father General Tilney, and the artful, heartless flirt Isabella Thorpe.

Buck's first novel about an upper-class Chinese family.  It's the story of Madame Wu, beautiful and intelligent, who decides on her 40th birthday that her physical duty to her husband is over and, against his will, finds him a concubine.  She is as deep as he is shallow, a good wife and mother, who prides herself on having raised four sons and married off the three oldest, but she doesn't realize she has never loved her husband, until she meets her real soulmate in the person of Brother Andre, a renegade Catholic priest whom she engages to teach her son foreign languages.  Madame Wu also becomes Brother Andre's pupil and learns more from him than he ever set out to teach; what Brother Andre gives Madame Wu is the priceless gift of self-knowledge.  Madame Wu has been the heart and soul of her large household, totally in control in her quiet way, but she realizes that running her large household is one thing; running her family's lives is something else again, and the best thing she can do for them is help them be who they were meant to be.  In Madame Wu, Pearl Buck created a remarkable character who after 40 years finally learns what it is to love.	2004-03-15

Let's face it, folks, the book doesn't pretend to be Jane Austen. It's called an &quot;entertainment&quot;. That's all it is, no more, no less. The fact that it's second-rate entertainment is neither here nor there. Some people take this book far too seriously. Lighten up.<br />The focus in &quot;Presumption&quot; is on Georgiana Darcy, the younger sister of the hero of &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;. Some readers were upset that the focus wasn't on Darcy himself and Elizabeth. But we know at the end of &quot;P&amp;P&quot; that those two were married and lived happily ever after, and what else is there to be said about people who live happily ever after? So a new focus is needed, and Barrett chooses Georgiana Darcy, not a bad choice at all when you come to think about it, because all we knew about her from &quot;P&amp;P&quot; is that she was very young, innocent, almost made a disastrous elopement with the detestable Wickham and came to her senses in time, and was devoted to her brother and Elizabeth.<br />Julia Barrett (actually a trio of three different writers each trying to write like Austen and not succeeding very well) needs to marry Georgiana off, so two prospects are introduced: James Leigh-Cooper, an up-and-coming young architect to the aristocracy, and Captain Thomas Heywood, a dashing, handsome army officer distantly related to Darcy's noxious aunt Lady Catherine DeBourgh. Lady Catherine, blinded by Captain Heywood's good looks and charm, wants to marry him off to her daughter Anne, since she thinks that being related to the DeBourghs, he must be rich like they are. Boy oh boy, is she about to be disillusioned. Seems Captain Heywood, who doesn't have a shilling to his name, has leagued with the loathsome Wickham in a dastardly plot to frame an honest woman for shoplifting and blackmail her to get rich. Of course the poor victim has to be nobody else but Mrs. Phillips of Meryton, Elizabeth's airhead aunt.<br />While Darcy goes off to London to help untangle the mess with the assistance of Elizabeth's uncle Gardiner, Leigh-Cooper is trying to make Georgiana fall in love with him but she has a crush on Captain Heywood who is trying to hook either Anne DeBourgh or Caroline Bingley, 24 and still unwed, and the whole thing gets terribly complicated. Meanwhile, Kitty Bennett is off visiting Charlotte Collins at Hunsford, where she manages to captivate Mr. Collins' new curate, Samuel Beasley, while right across the road, Captain Heywood is busy at Rosings charming Anne DeBourgh. Lady Catherine loathes all Bennets on principle with a purple passion and tries to talk (or bully) Mr. Beasley out of this attachment, but she's bitten off more than she can chew here, and fortunately for Kitty and Mr. Beasley, Lady Catherine has more important fish to fry, as she discovers Captain Heywood is poorer than the proverbial church mouse for all his looks and charm, and gives him an unceremonious heave-ho from her premises. So Captain Heywood salvages what he can and elopes with Caroline Bingley, rescuing her from incipient old-maidhood while making himself considerably richer off her inheritance.<br />Of course everything gets untangled in the end, Georgiana finds and marries her true love, Wickham's dastardly plot is discovered in time, Jane and Bingley and their baby daughter Eliza are happily settled in their new estate within hallooing distance of Pemberley, Darcy and Elizabeth are still living happily ever after with their new son, Kitty becomes Mrs. Beasley in spite of the howls of protest from Lady Catherine, and Lady C. herself still has her unmarried Anne on her hands. Just what we expected. No, it's not very profound, and whatever the writer(s) intended, it is not, and never will be, Austen; but it's a fun way to spend a rainy afternoon. Just don't expect too much from it.>While Darcy goes off to London to help untangle the mess with the assistance of Elizabeth's uncle Gardiner, Leigh-Cooper is trying to make Georgiana fall in love with him but she has a crush on Captain Heywood who is trying to hook either Anne DeBourgh or Caroline Bingley, 24 and still unwed, and the whole thing gets terribly complicated.

And he has a past he can't run away from: he was a &quot;dew breaker&quot;, so called because of their practice of breaking in to homes at the crack of dawn while the dew still lay on the ground to arrest suspects and drag them off to jail and death; a former Tonton Macoute, one of Baby Doc's murderous thugs who kept the population in abject terror in Duvalier's Haiti.<br />Danticat's exquisitely written novel is more like a series of interconnected short stories, each one integral in itself, and yet each one related to the whole.  We meet people who have had their homes and their lives stolen by Duvalier's goons.  We see others who have escaped from terror in their homeland, only to see the face of evil in the faces of everyone they meet.  And we meet the dew breaker himself, an ordinary man you'd meet on the street any day, who allowed himself to be transformed into a monster.<br />What kind of person becomes a torturer?  He joined the Tonton Macoutes at nineteen, after Duvalier's army troops appropriated his family's land.  If you can't beat 'em, join 'em.  He uses his power to appropriate free meals in the best restaurants, free rent, and free access to other men's wives and daughters.  He rises through the ranks through becoming expert at vicious interrogations of dissidents; he's the best at his job.  One of his former victims says of him, &quot;He thought he was God.&quot;<br />The dew breaker meets his nemesis at the hands of another victim, a local priest who has been preaching dissent against the dictatorship.  The dew breaker is ordered to shoot him outside his own church, but arrests him instead and has him dragged to his own private interrogation chamber at headquarters.  The preacher, a gentle, mild-mannered individual, manages to inflict a horrible wound on the dew-breaker's face before being killed.  But being the victim for once instead of the victimized transforms the dew-breaker.  He's had enough.  He meets his own salvation -- and possible redemption -- in the form of the woman who helps cure the wound on his face and later accompanies him to America.  Although she's the relative of one of his victims, she can see the humanity hidden inside him.  They will live quietly in Brooklyn, minding their own business, harming no one.  All he has to do is figure out how to live with himself for the rest of his life.<br />In 244 pages, Danticat shows us the face of evil and its effect on the perpetrator, his victims, his own family and everyone he's touched.  The book moves back and forth across decades from the 1960s to the present, from Brooklyn to Haiti and back again, a seamless trip across time, space, and the tortured inner self of an ultimately pathetic individual.  Is there redemption for the dew-breaker?  We don't know, and Danticat doesn't tell us; just as she leaves it to the reader to decide which in the end is suffering the most: the dew-breaker himself, or the broken lives he's left in his wake.horrible wound on the dew-breaker's face before being killed.

Buck's novel of China at the turn of the 20th century, seen through the eyes of one peasant family, is a masterpiece of contemporary literature.  It's the rags-to-riches story of Wang Lung, a subsistence farmer whose aged father purchases a wife for him to bring him children to carry on the family line.  The old man finds him a wife who spent her childhood as a servant in a rich house.  O-lan was too homely to be raped by the rich master or his sons, but her virginity is prized by the old man and Wang Lung.  She is the perfect wife for the younger man, hardworking, self-denying, bearing him children with clockwork regularity.  For a few years, the family prospers.  But a peasant farmer is always at the mercy of the elements, and a disastrous drought sends them south to beg in the streets for their survival.  A chance find of a rich man's hidden treasure by O-lan means not only their salvation, but the end of poverty.  Wang Lung brings his family home to prosperity and buys more land to consolidate his wealth; eventually, he owns the house and land of the same wealthy man who sold him O-lan.<br />But as Wang Lung's fortunes prosper, he undergoes an insidious transformation.  A rich man like him has no need for an ugly peasant wife like O-lan.  He buys himself a concubine and sets her up in his house.  Ashamed of his own illiteracy, he sends his sons to school.  They grow up rich and spoiled, and take rich, spoiled wives.  The sons don't want to work on the land; they look down their noses at the peasant class they came from.  The family moves into the big house the rich man used to live in, and to the discomfiture and resentment of the villagers, Wang Lung becomes every day more like the rich man he so resented when he was poor himself, despising the unwashed masses.  It is only as he grows old that Wang Lung's ties to the land assert themselves above everything else; his sole wish is to die in his father's home on the farm he grew up in.  It's the curse of his life that his sons are indifferent to the land he loves.<br />Pearl Buck was raised in China and her love of the land and its people is evident throughout the book.  Through her story of Wang Lung and his family we see the beginnings of the transformation of China from an agricultural to an industrial society and the profound changes this will bring on the country and its society.  She continued the story through two sequels, but neither has the simple power and brilliance of the first.  &quot;The Good Earth&quot; is her finest book.his life that his sons are indifferent to the land he loves.<br />Pearl Buck was raised in China and her love of the land and its people is evident throughout the book.

Renault's first historical novel, &quot;The Last of the Wine&quot;, is set during the Peloponnesian War, in an Athens grown too powerful and too complacent for its own good, riding for a calamitous fall.  Renault introduces us to Alexias, sixteen years old when this story opens, the surviving son of an aristocratic family, whose conservative father disapproves of his hanging around the agora picking up all kinds of new ideas, and especially the dangerous notions of a philosopher named Sokrates (Renault scrupulously keeps the Greek spelling of proper names throughout the book).  His father being called to serve in the disastrous Sicilian expedition leaves Alexias feeling as if a weight had rolled off him; out from under his father's thumb and free to spread his wings, he gravitates closer to Sokrates and a young Athenian nobleman named Lysis who becomes his closest friend and then his lover.  Bisexuality was a given in ancient Greece and Renault writes about such relationships as a matter of fact.  His father returning from the war beaten, degraded and escaping from the harsh slavery imposed on captured prisoners of war precipitates a crisis in the household; and Alexias and Lysis leave home to join the Athenian navy and find their own independence.  The relationship between these two is not just that of lovers but as mentor and pupil; as the older of the two, it is Lysis' responsibility to train his younger friend in the ways of war, honor and manhood; and it's a responsibility he takes seriously.  Lacking a benevolent father figure, Lysis becomes all in all to Alexias -- lover, big brother, best friend and confidant.  There are inevitable conflicts between them as Alexias grows to maturity and the two begin to grow away from each other to build their own lives as adults; but their relationship grows deeper as it adapts to changing times and needs.  Alexias says of Lysis, &quot;It was he who taught me to be a man.&quot;<br />&quot;The Last of the Wine&quot; is a story of war and friendship, love and honor, set against the turbulent background of classical Greece.  Here you'll meet some familiar figures from history textbooks: Alexias' contemporaries, Plato and Xenophon; Phaedo, the captive Melian boy who grew up to become a philosopher himself; and the fascinating character of the charming double-dealer Alkibiades, the renegade Athenian who played both ends against the middle and perhaps more than any other individual helped bring about Athens' defeat in the war and its subsequent decline.  Renault's bringing these real figures into her narrative makes it seem that much more alive and immediate; as we read this excellent book we travel deeper and deeper into 5th-century B.C. Athens, and it's with some regret that we turn the last page and are jolted back into the present.y and the two begin to grow away from each other to build their own lives as adults; but their relationship grows deeper as it adapts to changing times and needs.

A.A. Milne's timeless verses stay with us long after other childhood books have been forgotten.  Every child has his or her own favorites; I remember my son especially loved listening to \\"James James Morrison Morrison Weatherby George Dupree\\", \\"The King's Breakfast\\" (The King asked the Queen and the Queen asked the Dairymaid: \\"Could we have some butter for the Royal slice of bread?\\"), and Emmeline, who slipped off in a snit when someone told her her hands weren't clean.  Ernest Shepard's simple pen and ink drawings are a nice compliment to the poems.  Reading these poems to your youngsters is sure to be the start (or the continuation) of a family tradition.	2004-03-09

How could I have forgotten this enchanting book?  My son used to love Winnie the Pooh and all his friends when he was three years old.  In Piglet, Kanga and Baby Roo, Eeyore, Rabbit, Owl and Pooh himself, A.A. Milne created some of the best-loved characters in children's literature.  The stories in the book are funny and endearing, what child doesn't laugh out loud over Pooh and Piglet hunting for Woozles, and Eeyore losing his tail?  Read this book out loud to your child (or silently to yourself), and you may find yourself transported back to your own childhood:<br />\\"Isn't it funny<br />how a bear likes honey?<br />Buzz, buzz, buzz!<br />I wonder why he does?\\"	2004-03-09

Strangest of all is Mitchell's description of every slave on the plantation as coal black.  Thanks to rampant sexual abuse of female slaves by white owners and overseers, slaves came in shade from ebony to ivory, but Mitchell apparently couldn't stomach the reality of miscegenation.  In her parody of GWTW, \\"The Wind Done Gone\\", Alice Randall brings miscegenation to the reader up close and personal in the form of Cynara, the offspring of Gerald O'Hara (\\"Planter\\" in this book) and Mammy, whom Planter was happily dallying with while \\"Lady\\" (Ellen O'Hara) decorously pretended not to notice what was going on under her nose.  Mammy is forced to give preference to \\"Other\\" (Scarlett) over her own child; she gets back at her owners by systematic infanticide of each male child \\"Lady\\" brings into the world (readers of GWTW will remember that three infant boys lay in the family graveyard, each bearing the name of Gerald O'Hara, Jr).  Cynara is kindly treated by \\"Lady\\", oddly enough since \\"Lady\\" must know who her father is.  Randall brings into her story some other well-known GWTW characters, notably the \\"Dreamy Gentleman\\" (who else but Ashley Wilkes), \\"Mealymouth\\" Melanie, and \\"R\\", Rhett Butler, whose affections Cynara alienates from \\"Other\\" and whom she ultimately abandons for one of her own.<br />Randall would have written a much better book if it had been told from the viewpoint of Mammy herself, or any of the other blacks from GWTW, especially one of the hundred unnamed field hands who occupied the lowest place on the totem pole; we might have felt all the indignity of their existence that Mitchell glossed over; we might have learned what it really meant to be a slave at Tara.  But Randall was less interested in depth than in broad parody.  In this she succeeded, but parody is often shallow by definition, and \\"The Wind Done Gone\\" is ultimately a shallow book.  GWTW gave a romanticized and unrealistic picture of plantation slavery; \\"The Wind Done Gone\\" is equally unconvincing as a critique of the same institution.  It's clever and well-written, but when all is said and done, Randall is putting us on rather than enlightening us.  Overall, her book is a disappointment.ne\\" is ultimately a shallow book.

For the next two decades, Ike and Tina Turner were household names for R&B fans, and few if anybody outside their inner circle knew the price Tina was paying for being part of the team.  An abusive womanizer and control freak, Ike beat Tina with increasing violence over the ensuing 19 years as their fame grew and declined, until Tina finally reached inside herself for the strength to say \\"Enough\\".<br /><br />A question frequently asked is why do women wait so long to get out of such relationships.  Tina was bound to Ike by emotional and financial ties and her own insecurity.  The devil you know may be better than the devil you don't; who's to say what's waiting on the outside might not be worse than what you escaped from?  But one beating too many tipped the scales; for Tina, it was leave or be destroyed.<br /><br />The story of her flight from Ike with thirty-six cents to her name; the subsequent lawsuits for breach of contract and her comeback to fame and fortune that topped anything she had known when she was part of Ike-and-Tina-Turner is well known enough not to have to recount here; but most of this book is a fascinating and well-written exploration of her childhood, her rise to fame, and the hell of her marriage with Ike, told by many different voices besides hers and Ike's that were witness to it all.  We listen to Tina's own voice: \\"I gave in to myself.  I went inside of me to help me.  You can do it.\\"  We look at Tina now, heading for seventy and still drop-dead gorgeous, and we feel a deep admiration and respect for a very gutsy lady.  This book is inspired reading.<br /><br />Judy Lind	2004-03-07

As he simply states in the first book, &#34;This is the story of a rape, of the events that led up to it and followed it and the place in which it happened.&#34;  Through the gang-rape of a young English girl by Indian thugs, Scott takes us on a brilliantly exhaustive journey which brings together the time, the place and the people, and shows through the eyes of one family how the sun finally set on the British Empire.<br /><br />The story starts out with a love affair between Daphne Manners, an English girl and a young English-educated Hindu man, Hari Kumar; a relationship forbidden by the mores of the times and the ingrained British sense of their own superiority.  Complicating the situation is a young British officer named Ronald Merrick, whose attentions towards Daphne are rejected out of hand.  Merrick is at once contemptuous and resentful of Hari; despising his dark skin, he hates Hari for attracting the girl he wants for himself, for being better educated, and for being the product of a prosperous Indian family better than his own.  Merrick is the product and the victim of the British class system; coming from the lower classes, the only way he can better himself is through military service, where he will have the opportunity to treat dark-skinned British subjects like dirt.  When Daphne is raped at the Bibighar Gardens, Merrick has no problem believing Hari is to blame and has him arrested for the crime.<br /><br />Merrick is a swine, but through brown-nosing the proper people, he manages to rise through the army ranks and ingratiates himself into the Layton family, who belong to the class he has secretly aspired to join.  He takes advantage of the tenuous emotional health of the younger sister to get her to marry him.  He is thus secure in his new caste -- or so he thinks.  But his fundamental, underlying sense of insecurity causes him to bully everybody under him -- his men, the natives he hates, and occasionally his wife.  Meanwhile, Hari has been released from jail and simply bides his time.<br /><br />The end of the second world war finds Merrick a wounded war hero, but his prospects are far from certain.  His life is bound up with British India, and British India is on its last legs.  The Laytons can return to England, where they will live a comfortable upper-middle-class existence; Merrick's wife is dead, her death has disconnected him from her family who want nothing to do with him, and in England he will once again be the nobody he was before he joined the military.  As despicable as he is, he's a tragic figure with nowhere to go; he'll almost certainly be persona non grata in an independent India whose citizens have long memories concerning British soldiers who mistreated the natives.  But before Merrick can decide whether or not to offer himself as a soldier of fortune to Pakistan, the question is decided for him; his lifeless body is found in the middle of a ransacked room with &#34;Bibighar&#34;, the site of Daphne Manner's rape, scrawled in blood all over the walls.  Did Hari Kumar engineer this ultimate revenge for being falsely arrested and brutally questioned years before?  Nobody in the book knows for sure, and neither do we.  All we know for certain is that fortune is a wheel and what goes around comes around.<br /><br />In four exquisitely written and totally compelling novels, Paul Scott has written the intimate history of two young lovers, a British family, and a malevolent army officer in 1940's India, and through them, the larger story of the turbulent decade that saw the beginning of the end of the British Empire.  It's history up close and personal.  The excellent plot development and writing is sustained through all four books.  &#34;The Raj Quartet&#34; is a towering achievement and make up a collection of some of the best contemporary historical novels ever written.<br /><br />Judy LindLind	2004-03-06

When detectives Sonchai Jitpleecheep and his best friend Pichai arrive on the scene, one cobra fastens on Pichai's eyeball, killing him instantly. Sonchai, the half-breed product of a brief liaison of a Thai prostitute and an American GI, wants to find the criminal and wants revenge for Pichai. With the help (or hindrance, depending on the situation) of an FBI agent named Kimberly Jones who has a crush on him, Sonchai traces the crime back to a wealthy American jade dealer named Sylvester Warren, who hobnobs with the high rollers on Capitol Hill and has a particularly nasty hobby of flaying prostitutes alive, and his proteg&eacute;e Fatima, an exquisite half-black, half-Asian transsexual who went from street urchin to diva, and now has a hidden agenda all her own.<br />Sonchai, who is probably the only honest cop left in the graft-ridden Thai police force, quickly solves the \\"whodunit\\"; what he wants to know now is the \\"why\\". Turns out that Warren and the dead marine are linked together in some pretty shady enterprises, with the connivance and participation of Sonchai's chief Vikorn. Burdett shows us the sordid underbelly of Bangkok: the corrupt police, the sex bars that stay open all night, the drug dealing, the peculiarly Thai mindset that an outsider like Jones can never hope to understand. One of his Burdetts most interesting (and endearing, I have to admit) characters is Sonchai's intrepid mother Nong, a former bargirl who has parlayed her gift of languages, learned from living off Western lovers, and her shrewd head for business, into a venture that is sure to make her rich -- a brothel catering exclusively for the Viagra set. Is this immoral? Or is she simply filling an unmet need? It depends on how you look at it; just as one needs to put aside one's Western prejudices and read this book from an Eastern perspective. The one cavil I have with the book is Burdett's tendency to stereotype; the venal Vikorn probably doesn't represent all Thai policemen any more than the bitter and sexually frustrated Jones represents all American career women.

YOO-HOO, SOMEBODY!! ONE DOES NOT \\"SANITIZE\\" MARK TWAIN! Putting out a bowdlerized version of Tom Sawyer is an abomination on the level of \\"colorizing\\" vintage films.  \\"Tom Sawyer\\" is a classic that should be read uncut and uncontaminated.  Twain is an American legend, who created in his eponymous hero an American icon, and as if Tom himself were not enough, Twain went even further and introduced us in these pages to the incomparable Huckleberry Finn.  Is there anyone who has read \\"Tom Sawyer\\" who hasn't on some level identified with its hero?  Tom is a lovable rogue, an incurable romantic who has to deal with his loving and nagging Aunt Polly, chafes under the constraints of school and its tyrannical headmaster, cons his friends into whitewashing Aunt Polly's fence (probably the best loved chapter in the book), runs away with Huck and turns up safe and sound at his own funeral, saves a condemned man's life, and like every other red-blooded American boy, searches for buried treasure (and unlike any other red-blooded American boy, actually finds it.)  Twain created some unforgettable secondary characters; Tom's Aunt Polly, his smarmy little cousin Sid, Becky Thatcher who loves/loathes Tom by turns, and the wicked Injun Joe all stand out, but in Tom and Huck, Twain created two of the best loved figures in American literature, of their own time, our time and all time.  The book deserves to be appreciated in all its unsanitized glory; this is the version to read.	2004-03-05

Buck's last major novel and it holds its own with the best of her work.  In Madame Liang, Buck has created a fascinating character, a woman who is very much her own person.  After doing the very un-Chinese thing of leaving her husband when he takes a concubine, which he claims is his right because his wife has produced no son, Madame Liang determines to make her own way in the world and opens a gourmet restaurant that caters to the high and mighty of the People's Republic (even good Communists appreciate good food).  She has not only survived, but thrived, by keeping a low profile and providing her customers with the best.  But she has sent her three daughters, Grace, Mercy and Joy, to America to be educated; and now, after many years separation, Grace has been called home by her government to serve the new society.<br />Madame Liang has her own opinions about the new society which she has prudently kept to herself.  But Grace, back home in China, throws herself into her work as a doctor and embraces everything blindly, including a young physician named Liu Pang, who parrots everything he has read in Mao's Little Red Book.  Mercy, the second sister, is a musician, whose talents are not in demand in the People's Republic; but she misses her home and induces her new husband, a rocket scientist, to return to their country.  For Grace, the return home is the fulfillment of herself; for Mercy and her husband, it is a disaster.  Meanwhile, the third sister, Joy, a painter, having found romance and happiness with a fellow artist who has left China for good and never intends to return, remains in America to make her life with him.<br />Madame Liang watches the growing tension and hostility dividing the two older sisters with alarm and resignation.  She can't live her daughters' lives for them; all she can do is keep on living her own life.  But her own life can't survive the insanity of the Cultural Revolution; the very success of her restaurant means she's an enemy of the working classes.  The Cultural Revolution sweeps everything away in its path; including Madame Liang.<br />Buck writes with a flow that keeps her book moving effortlessly along like an unbroken skein of thread (one gets thoroughly caught up in the narrative before realizing that there are no chapters; the book moves from one scene to the next till the final page), covering some six or seven years from the end of the 50's to 1966.  Through it all, Madame Liang's continually expressed faith in her country and people suggest that, whatever her own fate, China and its people will survive in spite of themselves.

The same thing happens again on the night of the full moon in February, only this time the victim is a lonely spinster sighing over some valentines she sent to herself.  And again in March, April, May... there's a monster afoot, but it's only Marty Coslaw, a small boy in a wheelchair, who first realizes it's a werewolf, and then guesses who it is.  We guess, too, and Stephen King lets us know by the middle of the book just who it is.  From that point, the book deals with how to stop the horror, as the months roll by and the bodies pile up on the night of each full moon.<br />Most of the months are marked with special days in the calendar, and King tells us in a coda he realizes there is no way the lunar cycle could be skewed the way he tells it, but it in no way detracts from the fun.  Copiously illustrated with pen-and-ink drawings and color plates by Bernie Wrightson, it's an enjoyable novella that can be read in an evening.  Each little chapter is a story in itself, and together they make up a satisfying horror yarn.	2004-03-04

Books	4	6	6	N	N	The serpent's tooth	Buffie Cameron has a glamorous career as a flight attendant, doting parents, the man of her dreams, and she's sitting in a  holding cell in New York City, waiting to be arraigned on a murder charge together with her boyfriend.  Her parents rush to her side from a small town in Idaho to help her any way they can.  What she needs is the best lawyer she can get, and the best is Marvin Hirsch.<br />Buffie's parents believe in her implicitly, but Hirsch isn't so sure.  She's beautiful, manipulative, and an accomplished liar.  She has her parents wrapped around her little finger.  He'll get her off the hook, if he can, but the more he learns about her, the more he doubts he wants to.  He takes the case for a nominal retainer, more to convince himself than her parents that rich Jewish lawyers aren't necessarily Shylocks; but he feels compassion for these parents who are investing so much time, money and love on a child who clearly isn't worth it.  And as Buffie's mother learns more about the murder case and Buffie's relation with the victim, and about Buffie's sordid affair with her lover, a married man with a child, she realizes that the child she called &quot;the sun and the moon and the stars&quot; is a complete stranger to her, and probably always has been.  The Camerons are devout Mormons and they've brought her up with good Christian, small-town American values.  Little did they know Buffie has been conning her parents for years; they have doted on her, spoiled her, loved her without question, and all the while they never knew her.  And how does Buffie feel about her parents?  Shrug.  They're nice people; they love her, give her whatever she wants, she uses them and dispenses with them as she does everyone else.  Her one loyalty is to her lover, her prince charming, a stunningly handsome lowlife whose charm is all on the surface.  He and Buffie are made for each other.<br />In this well-written novel, Zelda Popkin raises some tough questions: is love of a parent for a child always unconditional?  Should a child need to earn a parent's love?  And can a child do something terrible enough to destroy a parent's love?  When Mrs. Cameron realizes that Buffie has lied repeatedly about her involvement in the murder of a trusting friend, and that her sole motive for the murder was to get hold of that friend's money, the mother is forced to admit that &quot;I loved her and I cannot love her any more.&quot;  The realization almost undoes her.  Mrs. Cameron is faced with the most agonizing prospect any parent is called on to face, the decision to give up a child.  Popkin is a sensitive writer and she brings us squarely into the middle of the mother's pain.  There's a rather boring subplot involving Marvin Hirsch's own rebellious teenager who's going through some obnoxious changes; but the center of this book is Buffie's mother, Mrs. Cameron, and her pain when she belatedly realizes that, when raising a child, love alone is not enough.r a child always unconditional?

Laclos' story of evil and depravity, starring a pair of jaded aristocrats so satanic we wonder if they have a human bone in their bodies, is one of the greatest, if not the greatest, novels of the 18th century.  In a nutshell, it revolves around the cynical plot to seduce and destroy the reputation of a young girl fresh out of her convent, which they plan and achieve with the icy calm and cynical detachment of a pair of mathematicians solving a calculus problem.<br /><br />The anti-hero and anti-heroine of this book, the Vicomte de Valmont and the Marquis de Merteuil, fascinate and repel us at once by their sheer wickedness.  Valmont is a depraved Casanova, lay-em-and-leave-em, who has lost count of all the broken hearts and destroyed characters he has left in his wake.  The Marquise de Merteuil, married and widowed too young, has combined shrewd intelligence with appalling powers of deception to engage a string of lovers whom she uses and casts off at random.  Somehow these two find each other and form an unholy partnership.  When the book opens, their affair is already spent, but they have remained friends; and the Marquise is infuriated when she learns she is about to be dumped by her current lover, a rich aristocrat named Gercourt, who is about to marry Cecile de Volanges, the most naive teenager who ever emerged from the protective cocoon of convent education.  Her main attraction, for him, is her virginity, and it is this the Marquise wants Valmont to do away with so that Gercourt will find out on his wedding night that he didn't get the innocent virgin he was expecting, but an already corrupted young woman, and will become the laughing stock of Paris.<br /><br />Seducing and abandoning an innocent girl is an old story to Valmont, but he has more pressing concerns; he is hopelessly in love with a young married woman, Madame de Tourvel, whose virtue seems impregnable.  And here he appears as more sympathetic and human than the Marquise; even if he's trying to seduce a married woman, he, at least, is capable of love; something which is beyond the Marquise, who sees other people as nothing more or less than objects to be used or cast aside.  It's only when he finds out that Cecile's mother has been telling Madame de Tourvel his scandalous life history that he decides to seduce Cecile, to pay back the mother for messing in his business.  At the same time, he perseveres in his pursuit of Madame de Tourvel.  But just at the point of victory, the Marquise turns his very strength, his ability to love, into a weakness; she uses it as a weapon against him to make him think his love for Madame de Tourvel is contempible.  At this point, we see the real conflict in the book, Valmont against the Marquise.  But Valmont, as cynical and jaded as he is, is no match for this lady; her very emotional detachment makes her unassailable.  Valmont doesn't have a chance.  He's not only destroyed the Madame de Tourvel, he's also destroyed himself.  It looks like the Marquise is the sole victor in this combat.  But is she?  Fatally, the Marquise has forgotten that letters can be dangerous weapons, and she's written a few too many.  What goes around comes around.<br /><br />Laclos's book caused a sensation in its own time that reverberated for decades afterward; 40 years after its publication it was condemned by a criminal court and publicly incinerated in a mass book-burning ceremony.  If Laclos had still been alive then, they might have wanted to toss him on top of the pyre.  Whatever feelings the book may have aroused when it was written, it has endured for two hundred years since as a masterpiece of literature in any language.  Any book that has been the basis of three different films, each unique from the other, has to be saying something to modern readers.  Laclos' book says a great deal and says it magnificently.<br /><br />Judy Lind	2004-02-28

He can produce spare, tight sentences that evoke chilling and haunting images.  But there's something fundamentally lacking in &quot;Less Than Zero&quot; which makes me give this book only three stars.<br />Ellis is a master at depicting the anomie of the young, bored, and super-rich, as he did superbly in &quot;American Psycho&quot;; but at least the loathsome yuppies in that book were alive.  &quot;Less Than Zero&quot; seems populated by walking zombies.  Here we have Clay, the protagonist (or is he an anti-protagonist?) fresh off the train home for mid-year break from a college in New Hampshire (Dartmouth, maybe?  Ellis carefully declines to identify the school); he hasn't been home for two minutes before he's bored into a coma.  The problem is, he's already bored the reader.  And the rest of the people in the book aren't any better: Blair, his soon-to-be-ex-girlfriend, spoiled rotten by her film-director father; Julian, descending into a miasma of drugs and prostitution; Daniel and Trent, indistinguishable blonde beach boys with too much money and nothing to do for it; and Clay's parents, dashing from one extra-marital affair to the next, and his sisters, only in their early teens but already as crass, materialistic and soulless as Clay and the parents -- are there any redeeming virtues to these people?  Or is what passes for their lives an experience in pure hedonism?  Clay seems more like a cardboard cutout than a person; his soul is so shriveled he can watch a snuff movie featuring a fifteen year old girl and yawn through the whole thing.  He's a passive sociopath, uncaring, unfeeling, un-alive.  One gets the impression that the only reason he's not out making a snuff film of his own is that it would take too much effort.  Clay is fascinated by a billboard on the freeway that says &quot;Disappear Here&quot;.  We get the feeling that if Clay disappeared, nobody would care much one way or the other.  He's that much of a cypher.<br />Ellis's problem in this book is he does such a great job of describing the emptiness of his character's lives, we wonder why he bothered writing about them at all.  They don't grab us, they don't interest us, there's nothing about them we can relate to.  As Blair says to Clay toward the end of the book, &quot;You're a beautiful boy, but that's about it.&quot;  It's not that Ellis can't invent interesting characters; Patrick Bateman, the anti-hero of &quot;American Psycho&quot;, was a loathsome psychopath, but at least there was some substance to him.  The characters in &quot;Less Than Zero&quot; seem to be made of air.  Perhaps that's the fundamental problem with the book; the sense of emptiness is so overwhelming that ultimately the book's impact on us fades to less than zero.that much of a cypher.<br />Ellis's problem in this book is he does such a great job of describing the emptiness of his character's lives, we wonder why he bothered writing about them at all.

It's the story of Andr&eacute; Bar, sixteen years old, living what should be a charmed life in the Côte d'Azur in France.  His father is rich, his mother is beautiful, he gets top grades in school and he has a pretty, sympathetic girlfriend.  So what's his problem?  His problem is his parents, who use him as a sounding board to vent their grievances against each other.  Although they dote on him, they loathe each other, and lacking confidants among their acquaintance, they turn Andr&eacute; into their confessional, forcing him to listen to what he doesn't want to hear and doesn't want to know.  The only one Andr&eacute; can turn to for understanding is his girlfriend, whose own parents are everything he wishes his parents were and aren't.<br />There is no mystery here and very little action; &quot;The Confessional&quot; is simply a keen and poignant exploration of the death of childhood illusions.  It's an exquisite little gem of a novel about the loneliness of adolescence and a boy who must find for himself the love and understanding he can't find at home.  Andr&eacute; comes to realize that, whatever his parents problems are, he can't let them make their problems his own; and the story ends with him developing the beginning of the hard shell of adulthood that will allow him to focus on making his own way in the world.  For now, he will concentrate on passing his end-term exams.  There will be time, after that, for his adult life to begin.	2004-02-27

Yeats' immortal words could be a fitting epitaph to the Macedonian empire after Alexander's death.  No one could have anticipated Alexander dying so young, and his death left a void it quickly became apparent no one could fill.  The army and the empire had been held together solely by one man's dynamism, and when he died, everything fell apart.<br />&quot;Funeral Games&quot; was Renault's last book, and, fittingly, the subject was the Alexander she was so fascinated with.  Coming after &quot;The Persian Boy&quot;, which was the best of her Alexander books, &quot;Funeral Games&quot; is a bit of a letdown.  For one thing, it's lacking its main protagonist.  For another, for some reason I can't fathom, Renault returned to the Latin spellings of many of the Greek and Macedonian names; for instance, Antipatros becomes Antipater.  It wasn't necessary and it diminishes the sense of time and place.  And thirdly, Renault went back to writing in the third person, as she did in &quot;Fire From Heaven&quot;.  Part of Renault's magic is that when she writes in the first person, she propels us right into the middle of the action; when she writes in the third person, it's like watching the action through a clear sheet of plate glass.  We see it, but we're not part of it.<br />Furthermore, with Alexander out of the action, the rest of the figures are simply supporting players without a lead.  Renault does introduce a couple of new characters; one is the tragic figure of Alexander's mentally retarded half-brother Arridaios, who had a bit walk-on part in &quot;Fire From Heaven&quot;, and who conveniently turns up near at hand in Babylon at Alexander's death; the other is a young grand-daughter of Philip named Eurydike, as ambitious as Alexander's mother Olympias but unfortunately lacking her shrewd calculation; she marries Arridaios in a clumsy power play but she's helpless against Olympias's cold-blooded malice.  Few of the characters actually engage us; Olympias fascinates us as a figure of pure evil; Perdikkas is exasperating in his wrong-headedness and tunnel vision; Bagoas makes a brief but ultimately frustrating appearance -- we don't see nearly enough of him this time; Roxane starts off as a miniature Olympias but she quickly pales into insignificance next to the real thing (maybe, when she met Olympias, Roxane wisely decided to keep a very low profile), and Eurydike came off as just plain annoying to this reviewer, blundering blindly from one mess to another and seemingly unable think before she acts.  The only character who is wholly likeable in this book is Ptolemy, Alexander's half-brother; wise, sensible, realizing from the beginning that no one could take Alexander's place, he hewed to the Greek adage of &quot;nothing too much&quot;, bit off no more than he could chew, and turned the satrapy of Egypt into one of the most flourishing kingdoms of the Hellenistic age.<br />&quot;Funeral Games&quot; would have profited immensely from a first person narrator, one who would have tied the story together; without it, the story jumps back and forth from place to place, and the fragments never achieve a cohesive whole.  But it's a fascinating ride through a chaotic period, and Renault's scrupulous research is evident throughout the book.  Perhaps it was inevitable that the book, as well as the world he lived in, would be diminished without Alexander.; Olympias fascinates us as a figure of pure evil; Perdikkas is exasperating in his wrong-headedness and tunnel vision; Bagoas makes a brief but ultimately frustrating appearance -- we don't see nearly enough of him this time; Roxane starts off as a miniature Olympias but she quickly pales into insignificance next to the real thing (maybe, when she met Olympias, Roxane wisely decided to keep a very low profile), and Eurydike came off as just plain annoying to this reviewer, blundering blindly from one mess to another and seemingly unable think before she acts.

Are the Soviets planning a stealth attack or what?  The Americans don't have a clue.  Oddly enough, neither do the Soviets.  The sub's captain, Marko Ramius, is a man with a deep loathing and resentment towards the government of his homeland, and he's planned a spectacular revenge.  It falls to a lower-level CIA functionary named Jack Ryan to figure out what's afoot: Ramius and his crew are attempting to defect to the United States, bringing a billion-dollar present with them.<br />Tom Clancy has churned out dozens of novels since, of descending quality; &quot;Red October&quot; was his first and it's by far his best.  He goes into great technical detail describing the workings of a submarine but he explains it so well that any reader can understand what he's saying.  His characters aren't very profound, but characterization isn't the main draw here; the hunt and the subsequent chase of Red October by the Americans, who want to keep it and the crew safe, and the Russians, who want to destroy it at any cost, keep us spellbound while turning page after page.  Clancy didn't fall into the trap of venting out the political propaganda that spoiled so many of his later books; he keeps &quot;Red October&quot; squarely on target, concentrating on the thrill of the chase, and the actions rockets along non-stop from the first page to the last.  If you read only one Clancy novel, this is definitely the one to go with.  None of his other books can touch it.	2004-02-22

Michael Schneider takes us on a fantastic voyage through the primary numbers one through ten, and shows us how numbers and geometry have helped shape our world and the cosmos.  Why is a manhole cover round?  Because a circle, whose diameter is everywhere equal, is the only shape that won't fall into its own hole.  Three symbolizes harmony -- life has a beginning, a middle and an end.  Life forms are often characterized by pentagons (cut an apple in half crosswise and look at the seeds), while six is the number of structure-function-order, as seen in the hexagonal symmetry of crystals and snowflakes.<br /><br />This book is by no means for math majors only; even math dummies like this reviewer will find themselves totally caught up.  Art and design students especially will appreciate the almost infinite variety of possible designs suggested within each primary number and the basic shapes (circle, square and triangle).  Schneider also shows how, with a compass, pencil and straightedge, one can construct one's own symbolic universe.<br /><br />I came away from this book not only enlightened on the subject of symbolic math, but blown away by the relationship between geometry and religion.  Because reading this book makes one realize that the universe is not random, as we see it within our limited scope, but has a definite function and order, and perhaps only the God who created it according to His plan can see it whole.<br /><br />Judy Lind	2004-02-19

I never would have believed it, but King has finally done it -- he has written a book that is almost impossible to get through.  King is usually the most readable of writers; he's a magnificent storyteller and he has a way with prose that makes his sentences zip along.  But this far into The Dark Tower series, he's bogged down into a morass that makes reading this book seem like slogging through quicksand with jackboots on.<br />King intends The Dark Tower to be a story of the quest for the nexus of all space and time, but in &quot;Wolves of the Calla&quot; he's gotten so hopelessly entangled in parallel worlds, we wonder where the heck he is going and if he ever intends to get there.  We're in Calla Bryn Sturgis in some world beyond this one, who knows where; each birth in this community seems to bring forth twins, and every decade or so a posse of evil wolves sweep down on the hapless hamlet and carry off one of every set of twins between toddlerdom and teendom; the abductees come back &quot;roont&quot;, semi-zombies doomed to a short, sad life.  Into this community come Roland and his ka-tet, to help the villagers learn to stand up for themselves and defeat this plague.  Okay, it's a pretty good plot.  But King has to get sidetracked here, there and everywhere -- Susannah is pregnant with something too horrible to contemplate, Father Callahan emerges from his flight from 'Salem's Lot with an interminable tale of woe which takes up a good third of the book, and on and on it goes until we're left wondering where King is going with all this, or if he's just spinning his wheels going nowhere.<br />If King had only kept it simple, it would have been a much better book, but he's given in to his fatal penchant for over-writing, which causes him to inject a lot of hot air while adding nothing of substance.  It's not that he can't do it right when he sets his mind to it -- the first volume in the series, &quot;The Gunslinger&quot;, was an excellent, tightly written novel that carried us along non-stop from beginning to end, with no unnecessary detours along the way.  &quot;Wolves&quot; meanders in and out and roundabout, until we just want to get the whole thing over with.  I always wondered what happened to Father Callahan after his flight from 'Salem's Lot (one of King's best books), but this was not the place to find out.  And in what is surely the tackiest gambit this reviewer has ever come across, King has to inject his own self into the book near the end.  For what purpose, since it adds absolutely nothing to the story?<br />King says the sixth book in the series will be released in June, and the seventh and final volume near the end of this year.

What is astonishing is that the world seems to have forgotten what was, before AIDS, the most lethal infection ever to visit the world, just 85 years ago -- the Spanish Flu epidemic of 1918.  It came seemingly out of nowhere and spread all over the planet, reaching into its remotest corners, and left 30 million people dead in its wake.  The spread was helped enormously by troop movements in the First World War.  What made this flu so frightening was the speed with which it killed; there were reports of people leaving for work feeling fine, and dropping dead before they reached the office.<br /><br />Davies' book holds our attention while he is describing the flu epidemic and its effects on the patients and survivors; where the book bogs down is in the chapters on the search for what caused it.  A more detailed historical examination of the impact the flu had on the world in various countries and societies would have made it a more interesting book.  Davies writes well, and his warning that the flu merits more respect than being just an annoying annual pest needs to be taken seriously. He makes a good case that a return of a devastating flu virus is not a matter of if but of when, and this time around its spread will be immeasurably aided by jet travel.  As Davies points out, as lethal as the AIDS epidemic has been, and will continue to be, one can, with good luck and common sense, avoid being infected with HIV; but in the event of a return of a killer flu, how can you stop breathing?<br /><br />Judy Lind	2004-02-19

Renault scrupulously researched the texts as background for her novels, and the same scholarship is evident in this excellent bio.  Starting with the legends that grew up around him in his own lifetime and continue down to this day, Renault explores Alexander not only as a king and a general, but as a man, a figure at once simple and complex, for whom the words doubt and failure simply didn't exist.  She takes us through his childhood with his battling parents (what a horror his controlling mother Olympias must have been), his mother's possible role in the murder of Philip, and Alexander's subsequent accession to the throne of Macedon and his campaign to liberate the Greek city-states of Asia from Persian domination.  Interestingly, as Renault shows us, Alexander didn't set out to Asia to conquer the known world; it was when he saw the quality of the opposition that he realized he could do a much better job of being Great King than the current title holder.<br /><br />Renault based most of her biography on Arrian, whose scrupulously level-headed account of Alexander's life and achievements was based on the writings of Ptolemy, who knew Alexander intimately as a friend, a general, and possibly as his half-brother (Philip's philanderings were notorious and Olympias' reaction can be only too easily conjectured).  However, whereas Arrian's pro-western bias shows through when he repeatedly refers to the Persians as \\"foreigners\\", although it was the Macedonians and their allies who were invading a foreign continent, Renault is free of any such insularity.  Where other biographers have excoriated Alexander for \\"Persianizing\\", Renault points out that adopting Persian customs was one way of making an alien king seem less foreign to them.  (To be fair to Arrian, he himself attributed this honorable motive to Alexander.)  Alexander did not share his soldiers' contempt for Persians, both as conquered subjects and as \\"aliens\\"; he was clearly drawn to their dignity, their pride in themselves, and their civilized ways which made the Macedonians seem like so many boors.  Renault also explores in detail some of the more controversial chapters of Alexander's life and reign, such as the murder of Parmenion which followed on the heels of the treachery and execution of his son Philotas (Parmenion's obligation to seek revenge for his son's execution would have splintered the Macedonian army); the killing of the Macedonian general Kleitos in a drunken rage (Renault makes no bones about stating factually that Alexander got drastically drunk on a few occasions, although she stops short of repeating other biographer's accusations that he was an alcoholic), and the torture and execution of the Royal Squires whose plot to kill him as he slept came unraveled when one of them got cold feet.  She shows us that manners and morals were not in Alexander's time what they are in ours, and that Alexander must be judged by the times in which he lived.<br /><br />As difficult as Alexander must have been at times, his army adored him, and his high command stuck with him to the day of his death.  Exactly how he died is still in dispute, and Renault explores this at some length.  We know from the historical record that the Macedonian regent's son, Cassander, loathed Alexander and the feeling was abundantly mutual, and the specter of possible poisoning has never been dissipated.  On the other hand, Renault tells us Alexander deliberately ignored a dangerous illness, and in fact, did everything against his physician's advice to make it worse.  As attached as he had been to Hephaistion, Renault suggests that Hephaistion's death some months previously might have sent Alexander over the edge, and like a candle burning at both ends, Alexander simply burnt himself out.<br /><br />Readers who like factually detailed biographies packed with charts and footnotes should look elsewhere; Renault's biography is notably short on both.  Her book is more a character study than a history; we are looking at who Alexander was, not just what he did.  Comparing this book to her historical novels about Alexander is comparing apples to oranges, but Renault's genius at bring history to life in her fiction shows through here as well.

There's fun galore in &quot;The Seven-Percent Solution&quot;, Nicholas Meyer's artful takeoff on literature's most famous detective creation, Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes.  We know from Conan Doyle that Holmes had a cocaine habit; as Meyer's book opens, we see Holmes in a cocaine-fueled fit of paranoid delusions that the evil Moriarty is after him again.  Dr. Watson consults with big brother Mycroft Holmes, who confides to him that Moriarty used to be their math tutor, no more, no less, and is concerned that little brother Sherlock's cocaine addiction is spinning out of control.  Between them, they find a way to finesse Holmes into going to Europe to be treated by Sigmund Freud, who has been doing remarkable work with cocaine addicts, but first they have to convince Holmes that they are on the track of the nefarious Moriarty.  After a hilarious chase led by a slightly wonky bloodhound with a special taste for vanilla extract, Holmes and Watson end up at Freud's front door, and Holmes enters seven agonizing days of enforced cold turkey.<br />Holmes emerges clean, sober, and distanced from everything, and part of his cure to jerk him back into reality involves bringing him into the case of a young woman Freud is treating for symptoms of hysteria.  A quick survey of the patient is enough for Holmes to realize that some dicey doings are afoot, and that this is just the tip of the iceberg, the iceberg being a plot to involve all of Europe into a continent-wide conflagration.  But just as Freud is impressed with Holmes' crime-solving abilities, Holmes is impressed with Freud's ability to read the perpetrator's mind, and he gives Freud what is meant as the ultimate compliment: &quot;You have taken my methods, observation and inference, and applied them to the inside of a human head.&quot;  (Actually, Holmes's methods were observation and deduction, but who wants to cavil here?)  Holmes, Watson and Freud work together to solve the problem, and the payoff is Freud's request to hypnotize Holmes in order to be able to see into his head.  What's inside there is a revelation, and as Meyer explains Holmes to us, we understand his solitary life, his avoidance of women, his loathing of Moriarty and why he chose his singular profession to begin with.  Meyer's book is great fun and fairly accurately follows the narrative style of Dr. Watson.  Imitation may be the sincerest form of flattery; Conan Doyle would have loved it.were observation and deduction, but who wants to cavil here?)

But he is one helluva storyteller, as well as a more than passably good writer.  \\"The Stand\\" is not his best book, but in a way it's more chilling than some of his better works like \\"Salem's Lot\\" or \\"Pet Sematary\\"; whereas nobody really believes in vampires or Wendigos, \\"The Stand\\" gives us a scenario that is all too believable.  In a hidden laboratory in the Mojave Desert, the military is busy creating all kinds of nasty bugs to be used in bio-chemical warfare, in direct violation of the Geneva convention; and one of them is a spectacularly lethal, shifting-antigen virus called Superflu which has 99.4% communicability, which means 99.4% mortality.  Simply put, almost everybody in the world will catch it, and everyone who catches it will die.  When the virus breaks out of the lab,a technician bolts off the base with his family, carrying the Superflu virus with them, and a chain reaction is set in motion that will culminate in the deaths of billions of people.  In a world gone insane with death, social breakdown and anarchy, an Antichrist figure appears named Randall Flagg, and the survivors of the Superflu epidemic will have to take sides in an apocalyptic confrontation between Good and Evil.<br />The first 250 or so pages of \\"The Stand\\" are by far the best, as King spins the compelling story of how the Superflu escaped from the laboratory, its rocketing spread across the United States, and from there to the rest of the world, and the spiraling descent into anarchy as people drop dead like flies.  Most of the survivors, including a lanky Texan, a young pregnant girl, a deaf-mute and his mentally retarded friend, a self-centered rock singer and others, gravitate towards their guardian angel, a 108-year-old black woman named Mother Abagail, just as others are drawn, in spite of themselves, to the Dark Man, some loyal to him for what he stands for, others out of fear (this dude has a habit of nailing people to crosses when he gets annoyed at them); everyone has to choose a side, no fence-straddling allowed.  Sooner or later, a clash is inevitable, and when it comes, only one side will be left standing.<br />King sometimes overwrites, and \\"The Stand\\" could have used some judicious pruning; but he knows how to keep the tension high and one has to give King his due, the tension never lets up in this book.  One reads this book and wonders, even without the mythical figure of Randall Flagg, could it actually happen?  In smaller ways, it already has: the plague epidemic in the 14th century killed a third of the populations of Europe and Asia, and less than 90 years ago, the \\"Spanish flu\\" epidemic of 1918 left 30 million people dead -- and this was before the age of jet travel.

I bought my son this book when he was two and a half and for weeks afterwards it was his favorite bedtime story.  Seuss's genius in writing this enchanting book was in combining some hilarious illustrations which the kids love with easy rhyming words which encourage children to read phonetically.  When a child sees the words \\"Ed, Ned, Red and Ted in the...\\" and he knows what sound \\"b\\" makes, the word \\"Bed\\" comes almost automatically.  The story itself is appealing to all toddlers (what two-year-old doesn't like to hop on Pop?) and the rhymes are almost hypnotic.  Read this book aloud enough times and you start chanting to yourself \\"Pup up, Brown down, pup is down, where is Brown, where is Brown, there is Brown, Mister Brown is out of town.\\"  (Your child will either look at you like you are nuts or join in enthusiastically.) Three months after I bought this book for my son, he was reading it out loud to me.  \\"Hop On Pop\\" is a great way to get the kids started with a lifelong interest in reading.	2004-02-10

David Macaulay's \\"Cathedral\\" is a book ostensibly written for children but which will fascinate readers of all ages.  In scarcely 80 pages, Macaulay takes us back in time to the year 1252 in the fictional French village of Chutreaux where the people decide to build the \\"longest, widest, highest and most beautiful cathedral in all of France\\" for the glory of God.  Macaulay's text is minimal, but his exquisite black and white line drawings say it all: the step-by-step stages in the building's construction, the craftsmen and the tools they used, and the dedication that kept this project going for 80 years until its completion.  We feel a sense of awe at the dedication of the original architects and craftsmen and builders who knew that they would be long dead before the cathedral was finally finished.  Macaulay's glossary at the end of the book helps us to understand the major elements of the Gothic cathedral, and his cross-sections and diagrams provide clear illustration of just how the cathedral rose from its foundations.  At the end of this volume, we share the awe and pride the townspeople felt at having shared a goal for over 80 years and making it a reality.  Macaulay's \\"Cathedral\\" is a marvelous creation in more ways than one.	2004-01-09

It's hard to say if this book is fiction, history or biography, since it reads so much like all three.  Haley found sizeable gaps in his efforts to trace his family roots, and of necessity had to fill in the blanks from his own imagination, but it reads so convincingly that none of the fictionalized parts detract from the overall story.  Probably millions of American blacks, I among them, have wondered where we came from and tried to trace our family lines, only to inevitably run up against a brick wall.  (I managed to trace my own family reliably back to my great-great-great-grandmother, who arrived here at the end of the 18th century on a slave ship, but I'll never know her tribe or her nationality.) Haley begins his story fittingly in a small African village, where a 17 year old boy named Kunta Kinte is abducted by slave traders after venturing out of his village alone.  His harrowing voyage to America is told in some 50 of the most gut-wrenching pages ever written.  It's been reliably estimated that the death rate on the slave ships was between 35 and 40%; translated into numbers, that means that besides the 14 million Africans who were dragged, more dead than alive, onto the shores of the Americas, another 11 million died en route.  Sold into slavery to a Virginia planter, Kunta lives out his life in bondage, struggling to hold onto the few remnant of his African identity.  Haley is a great storyteller and the narrative sweeps through succeeding five generations, bringing his subjects vividly to life, and it all reads like a great novel until we are brought up short by his own arrival on the scene a century and a half after his ancestor's birth, and then it hits us like a knockout punch: forget the novel, this is real.  This is Haley's family and every black family in America that has struggled to survive and has not only survived, but has succeeded despite enormous odds.  The most mind-blowing part of the book, for this reader, was when Haley returned to his ancestor's native Gambian village of Juffure and heard his own family history narrated by the Griot.  Haley has written, in his history of one family, the story of every family in America that traces its roots back to Africa from the 16th through the early 19th centuries.  In the words of old African-American saying, which has relevance for everyone, you can't know where you're going, if you don't know where you've been. Haley shows us, in vivid and at times excruciating detail, where we've been, and what we've come through to be who we are.and has not only survived, but has succeeded despite enormous odds.

Who cares?  Readers from 5 to 95 will enjoy this wonderful book; the kids for the story and the adults for Thurber's marvelous way with words.  It's a simple little fantasy tale of an abducted princess, a murderous duke, and the prince who comes to her rescue.  And it starts off as all fairy tales should, with \\"Once upon a time...\\"<br /><br />Thurber brings us the beautiful Princess Saralinda, the Duke of Coffin Castle who was so cold that he managed to stop time one snowy night when all thirteen clocks in the castle stopped at ten minutes to five and never started again, and Prince Zorn of Zorna, who called himself Xingu, the prince whose name begins with X and doesn't, who is the one man who can defeat the duke's evil plans and rescue Saralinda.  But Thurber's best invention by far is the Golux, a spaced-out wizard whose spells have a way of backfiring from time to time, who assists Zorn in his quest to save the princess.  And there is a deliciously spooky, never-seen monster called the Todal, that \\"smells of old, unopened rooms and sounds like rabbits screaming\\", who is the cold duke's infernal weapon, and, ultimately, his nemesis.<br /><br />Thurber's way with words will leave you boggle-eyed.  This is the quintessential read-aloud book and the kids love it.  On the second or third reading they'll be chanting along with sentences like these: \\"The brambles and the thorns grew thick and thicker in a ticking thicket of bickering crickets...\\"  And Thurber goes hogwild in making up all kinds of words that somehow managed to portray what he want to get across.  When he tells us that the duke slits open his victims from their guggles to their zatches, you may not know exactly what is a guggle and what is a zatch, but you get the idea.  And when the Todal gleeps while devouring a victim, we know just what Thurber is talking about.  (Try going \\"gleep\\" way at the back of your throat and you'll see what I mean.)<br /><br />\\"The Thirteen Clocks\\" is full of dark humor and the illustrations by Marc Simont are right in character -- dark, haunting and yet comical at the same time.

Oh wow, with a name like Ooroo, this place is just asking for trouble.  Seems that Black, the pirate chief, hates the letter O, because when he was a child his mother got stuck in a porthole, and he couldn't pull her in, so he had to push her out.  Poor Moms.  And now Black is about to consolidate his capture and takeover of Ooroo by banishing from speech and print every word and name which contains the letter O.  So how are we to pronounce Ooroo?  Or Otto Ott, whose name comes out sounding like a terminal stutter?  Or consider the case of poor Ophelia Oliver, who, when she lost her O's, vanished from the haunts of men.<br /><br />Thurber has written a hilarious book showing the pure chas and cnfusin that reign when the language is stripped of its O's.  How can you tell a cat from a cat?  Or a bat from a bat?  Strip the O from the language and we will all be indeed bgne and webegne.  Not to mention losing words like hope, love, valor, and the greatest of all, freedom.<br /><br />Black may have stripped the language of all its O's but he can't break the people's spirit, and eventually he and his crew hoist anchor and sail away into the sunset, leaving the people and their island with all their O's intact.  Kids will love this book for the hilarious play on words, as well as for the message it gets across.  A wonderful bk (oops, I mean book) for youngsters and oldsters alike.

It's not supposed to be read with a straight face; it's fun, and on that count, it measures up.<br /><br />What made the book especially enjoyable for this reader was that I know the Carnegie Hill neighborhood very well, and it was a lot of fun identifying all the places Levin mentioned in the book -- real places, in fact.  (The Corner Bookstore is one of my favorite book shops in all of New York.)  The story of the sophisticated, jaded older woman who falls in love with a younger man has been done to death, but Levin makes this one refreshing by giving the heroine sense enough not to take this too seriously; she knows sooner or later it's bound to end so she just enjoys what she has while she has it.<br /><br />The book's main theme of voyeurism is well presented; we share the heroine's mixture of fascination and revulsion, and realize how all too easy it is to get sucked into the thrill of snooping and being privy to all the neighbors' secrets.  And while the ending may be as believable as a two-headed giraffe, the whole book is slightly off-center so we shrug and enjoy the fun.  If you're looking for something heavy or profound, go read &#34;War and Peace&#34; or an equally weighty tome; &#34;Sliver&#34; is a good book to spend a rainy day with.<br /><br />Judy Lind	2003-12-24

The first chapters in the book seem fairly tame in comparison with the non-stop action of its predecessor, but the action picks up considerably with Theseus' invasion of Scythia and his battle with the Amazons and their queen Hippolyta, who turns out to be his soulmate and the one love of his life.  When Hippolyta is killed in battle, Theseus is left with the legacy of their love, their son Hippolytos, and his other son, Akamas, by his wife Phaedra who he married strictly for policy, the sister of his first love Ariadne whom he abandoned at the end of &quot;The King Must Die&quot;.  Theseus's disillusionment in his sons and his betrayal by Phaedra reflect the growing cynicism of an aging king and shows us a sharply different Theseus than the intrepid young man of the first book.  As usual, Renault's scrupulous research and her skill as a writer make her a joy to read; what makes me give this book four stars instead of five is its ending, which seems to be not so much an ending as a train wreck.  It's as if somewhere in the last third of &quot;The Bull from the Sea&quot;, Renault lost interest in her subject and just wanted to wrap the whole thing up and dispense with it.  Perhaps the Theseus legend proved to be too much for one book, but not enough for two.  Of all her historical novels, this one is probably her weakest; but when Renault is good, she is very, very good, and this book, while not her best, is very good indeed.	2003-12-21

As a historical novelist, Renault has no peer.  She researched her subjects thoroughly and evoked the time and place so accurately that her books seem to spring into life.  She was less interested in Theseus as a mythological figure than as a historical figure, and her rendering of Theseus as a lightweight, fast on his feet, quick and active, seems absolutely correct.  Renault is probably correct in believing that the myth of the minotaur in the labyrinth derived from the actual bull dancers of ancient Crete, who were for the most part captive slaves from the subject territories ruled by Crete three thousand years ago, and her depiction of the bull court, and the team Theseus trained to dance with the bulls, realizing that they would either all survive together or they would all die together, is more compelling than any labyrinth story we are already familiar with.  In &quot;The King Must Die&quot;, Theseus becomes a very human figure we can relate to and empathize with, rather than a stiff mythological figure more god than man.  This is Renault's genius -- she brings ancient civilizations so vividly to life that we feel we are right there in the middle of the action.  &quot;The King Must Die&quot; is one of her best.	2003-12-21

You sip her books slowly, savoring each word; every sentence of Morrison's is a tone poem.  One has to read her books twice, once for the story and again just to appreciate her incredible gift with language.  &quot;Love&quot; is a slim volume (just over 200 pages) that packs a powerhouse wallop.  It's the story of Bill Cosey, long dead, the owner of an upscale hotel for blacks back in the segregated 1940's, and the women whose lives he impacted on in different ways, with a chapter devoted to each: friend, stranger, benefactor, lover, husband, guardian, father and phantom.  We see the havoc and destruction he caused in the lives of so many close to him, and especially in two women, his child-bride Heed and his grand-daughter Christine, who were best friends in childhood and grew up as bitter enemies, locked in a vicious co-dependency that can only end when one or the other dies.  Morrison doesn't give us a straight narrative; her story deviates from highways to by-ways, weaving in and out until it all comes together in a shattering climax.  She shows us that there are all kinds of love, including the love-hate between Heed and Christine that will finally destroy them both in different ways.  A great book by an awesomely talented writer who in her own time has become a living legend.	2003-12-20

But he has neither the skill or the ability to carry it out.  I can't find anything in this book that justifies the enormous hype it has received.  The quest for the Holy Grail, and what the Grail actually represents, is fascinating, but Brown tries to wrap it in the stale trappings of a pedestrian whodunit that doesn't do the material justice.  The characters are one-sided and don't really engage us, and the writing is just plain sophomoric.  The idea of Mary Magdalene as the wife of Jesus isn't original with Brown; it's been done much better by other writers, most notably by Jos&eacute; Saramago in &quot;The Gospel According to Jesus Christ&quot;.  I came away from this book with a deep sense of disappointment.  Brown had a good idea for a book, but somebody else should have written it.	2003-12-20

But this time, the dark forces after Harry are getting a tad impatient; they don't want to wait for him to return to Hogwarts before raising all kinds of cain; the dreaded Dementors attack Dudley right in his own backyard.  Driven off by Harry in the nick of time (one wonders why Harry didn't just let the Dementors get Dudley -- and how did Aunt Petunia know what the Dementors were anyway??), Harry finds himself hauled before the Ministry of Magic charged with violating the laws against underage wizardry.  But he's vindicated by Dumbledore's intervention in his behalf and spends the rest of the summer prior to his return to Hogwarts at the headquarters of the Order of the Phoenix, an intrepid group of wizards out to thwart the evil machinations of Voldemort and his demonic adherents, meeting in the home of Harry's godfather Sirius Black.  We find out the fascinating tidbit that not only are most of the wizarding families related to each other by blood or marriage, but Black himself is related to -- of all people -- the evil Malfoy clan.<br /><br />We remember in Book Three that ditzy Professor of Divination Trelawney, in the middle of one of her interminable reading of the tea-leaves that looked like so much mush to Harry, Ron and Hermione (Divination wasn't one of their best subjects) all of a sudden went into a fit and made one of her few geniune predictions: that Voldemort would return \\"greater and more terrible than before\\".  She wasn't kidding.  He's back, all right, along with some of his most dangerous followers whom he's managed to spring from Azkaban, and they're all out for blood, Harry's especially.<br /><br />Some new faces are introduced in this volume; we meet Sirius's incredible mother, a vicious harpy who makes the Wicked Witch of the West look like a choir girl; a pink-haired punk rocker in the Order of the Phoenix named Nymphadora Tonks (\\"Wow! a FIREBOLT!?\\" she gasps when she sees Harry's broom; making us wonder if a Firebolt is the Lamborghini of broomsticks); a somewhat spacy fourth-year Hogwarts student named Luna Lovegood (no wonder she's called \\"Loony\\") who, weird though she appears, is the only person who seems to understand where Harry is coing from; and, overshadowing all, a pint-sized witch named Dolores Umbridge, oozing evil from every rotten pore, who usurps Dumbledore's position at Hogwarts as Headmistress and seems to be on a personal mission from Voldemort to do Harry and his friends in.  But Harry isn't going down without a fight; he and his friends form their own secret group to learn advanced defenses against the dark arts, which they will put to good use in the book's climactic conflict in the Minister of Magic when they come face to face with Voldemort and some of his more unsavory adherents.<br /><br />Besides having to deal with the noxious Umbridge (one really wants to tie a bag of firecrackers to this lady and watch her explode), Harry has enough on his plate just being fifteen with a crushing course load and a crush on Cho Chang, who turns out to be as shallow as she is pretty.  It's an endearing characteristic of Harry that, skilled as he is in wizardry, he doesn't have a clue about girls (asked by Ron to describe his first kiss with Cho, he says \\"wet\\"), and when Hermione tries to explain to him how Cho feels when he talks about other girls to her, she might as well be speaking Tagalog.  Harry also has to come to terms, like all adolescents, that at least one of his parents wasn't the paragon he imagined him to be; when he inadvertently blunders on Snape's worst memory, and discovers why Snape hated his father so much, we empathize with his shock at realizing that Potter Sr. was a world-class jerk at fifteen.  (Like most fifteen-year-olds, he grew out of it.)<br /><br />Rowling left a lot of threads hanging at the end of Book Five and this bothered a lot of readers, but it only left this one on tenterhooks waiting for Books Six and Seven.  We suspected from the beginning that it will finally come down to a fight to the finish between Harry and Voldemort, but all kinds of delightful subplots are pending in the meantime.  And some of her minor characters, especially Neville Longbottom, are developing in all kinds of interesting and unexpected ways.  Yes, someone close to Harry dies, and probably everyone and his brother knows who it is by now, but just in case there is someone out there who is still clueless, I'm not saying who.  Just let Rowling keep the magic coming through two more books, and after Book Seven is finally released, I will be among the multitudes clamoring for a sequel.

US	52477572	R3TBOAJ9DQZBMO	0140088784	876636990	Alexander the Great	Books	5	31	33	N	N	An excellent, balanced biography	Robin Lane Fox was only 27 when he wrote his biography of Alexander, but it's twice as good as many Alexander biographies written by authors who were twice Fox's age.  Fox was a very young Oxford don when he researched and wrote this book, and his immaturity shows in a few spots when he makes assertions that seem to be based on &quot;because I said so&quot;.  But overall, it's a very, very well-researched and well-written biography that presents Alexander in a balanced light, being neither hagiography nor hatchet-job.  It should be mentioned here that Fox's speculation that Philip's murder was probably masterminded by his wife Olympias was not original; it's specifically outlined in Mary Renault's &quot;Fire From Heaven&quot; and Renault is mentioned more than once as a resource in Fox's biography.  (One might wonder why a biographer would list a historical novelist as a resource, but Renault scrupulously researched her own novels for historical accuracy before she published them.) The one jarring note in this book is Fox's substituting modern place names for historical names; it may be easier to look them up on a map but unless you already know that Ekbatana is the modern-day Hamadan, it gets a tad confusing.  However, this is a minor cavil.  Fox writes extremely well; his style carries you right along in the narrative, and there are voluminous footnotes for reference at the end of the book.  One comes away somewhat awed that someone so young could have written such an excellent biography on one of history's most towering figures.	2003-12-18

While supporting himself as a caseworker for the New York City Department of Social Services, Bearden turned out works of jaw-dropping skill and artistic talent.  His inspiration ranged from Homer to the Bible to current events, and each was a vivid expression of black life in the Americas.  Some of the best examples of his output are represented in this volume.  The book is gorgeously illustrated and Ruth Fine's excellent narrative helps us get a deeper insight into one of America's finest artists.	2003-12-18

Left to fend for themselves are the mother, Samira, her daughter Nefisa, and three sons, Hassan, Hussein and Hassanein.  Hassan is a ne'er-do-well, a thug and drug dealer who lives on the margins of society.  Hussein is a fundamentally decent individual, quiet, hardworking, caring and empathetic.  We like him a lot better than his younger brother Hassanein, an arrogant, conceited go-getter and social climber who carves himself out a promising career in the military and doesn't care who he tramples on to reach his goals.  The tragic figure in this family is the daughter Nefisa, cursed with a homely face that makes marriage an unlikely prospect, and doubly cursed with a rampant sexual appetite that has no sanctioned outlet whatever for an unmarried woman in a muslim society.  Hassanein has no problem dumping his fiancee at the drop of a hat when he decides her family isn't of the class he aspires to belong to; he will disown his brother Hassan rather than be connected to petty criminal.  But he's brought up short against his sister's descent into prostitution, and his solution shows him in all his appalling soullessness.  \\"The Beginning and the End\\" shows us a family and a society torn apart by the conflict between tradition and modernity, especially in its depictions of a society in which women's lives are so circumscribed that they have nothing to look forward to except a marriage that may never materialize.  Mahfouz is not a very profound writer, but his sympathy for his characters, including the most degraded, is evident; he empathizes, never moralizes, and shows us a convincing picture of a family in torment.  I thought the translation was a good one; it's not stilted or overdone and it flows easily from one chapter to the next.  Mahfouz has given us in this book an intriguing story of a family divided against itself.	2003-06-10

In plain language easy for the layman to comprehend, Gonz&aacute;lez writes about the history of Santer&iacute;a, its roots in both African religion and Roman Catholicism (Santer&iacute;a is a syncretism of both), the Santer&iacute;a pantheon, magical practices and magical spells.  She also writes a separate chapter on brujer&iacute;a, or witchcraft, a malignant offshoot of Santer&iacute;a but distinctly separate from it.  Gonz&aacute;lez relates how many herbal spells used in Santer&iacute;a have beneficial medicinal properties, such as the herb higuereta which has been found to shrink malignant tumors, and she also discusses the mindset of those who follow both Santer&iacute;a and Catholicsm and have no problem integrating both into their lives, since each serves its own purpose.  The book doesn't go into great depths, but it's an excellent overview for those who want to explore more deeply into the religion and its beliefs and practices.  It also has the advantage of being written in English originally, so that it doesn't risk losing anything in translation. I'd recommend it to anyone who is interested in comparative religions and/or the history and culture of Latin America.	2003-06-10

Siinuhe is a foundling, adopted by a lowly physician, and in the tradition of ancient times, trained to follow in his adopted father's footsteps, coming of age at the same time a decisive event is about to take place: the death of the reigning pharaoh, Amenhotep III, around 1380 BC, and the accession of his son, Amenhotep IV, who styled himself Akhenaton.<br /><br />Sinuhe is a loner and a wanderer, whose self-imposed exile from his native country takes him to Syria, the ancient Hittite kingdom of Hatti, and Crete, before finally returning to Egypt, at the same time that Akhenaton attempts to overthrow the reigning god Ammon and his priests, and install his own vision, Aton, the one and eternal god, in Ammon's place.  As a political move, trimming Ammon's power in Egypt may have been a wise idea; the priests' power had grown so great that it was challenging that of pharaoh himself.  But as a religious experiment it was a disaster, especially in a country as rigidly conservative as ancient Egypt where change of any kind was anathema.  We see Akhenaton as a visionary out of touch with reality and with his people, a tragic figure doomed to failure.  And we share Sinuhe's ambivalence about this enigmatic figure, intrigued by pharaoh's vision of one just god who brings equality to all mankind, but repelled by the spreading social chaos this vision brings with it, especially when it threatens his own security and the lives of those he loves.<br /><br />Waltari bring us some of the people that have only existed in the pages of history books -- Akhenaton himself, his incredibly beautiful wife Nefertiti, his scheming, conniving mother Queen Taia, the boy king Tut, and Horemheb, the military general who became pharaoh after Akhenaton's death plunged the country into near anarchy.  But &#34;The Egyptian&#34; fortunately doesn't read like a history textbook; Waltari makes ancient Egypt and his characters come vibrantly alive.  And Sinuhe himself is wholly believable; a man of his own time and all time, sometimes wise, sometimes foolish in the extreme, trying to find his own place in his world, sometimes succeeding and sometimes not.<br /><br />Waltari is not only a great novelist but a fine historian, and he kept the background scrupulously accurate.  The book is true to its time and its location, and Naomi Walford's excellent translation into English keeps the reader moving along effortlessly from the first page to the last.  &#34;The Egyptian&#34; is Waltari's masterpiece; it's one of the best historical novels ever written.<br /><br />Judy Lindmilitary general who became pharaoh after Akhenaton's death plunged the country into near anarchy.

Taken on its merits, it's an awesome work of scholarship by a writer with a deep knowledge of the life of Christ, Christian and Jewish theology and biblical literature. Saramago gives us a Christ that is all too fallible; he's human, after all, as well as divine; a Joseph whose sin of omission in saving his own child from Herod's assassins while failing to warn other parents of the imminent slaughter of the innocents was expiated by his own death on a cross that foreshadowed the death of his son; a Mary who doubted her son's divinity, and a Mary Magdalene who relieved Jesus of his virginity and remained totally faithful to him afterwards, bodily and spiritually, up to the end.  Even more disturbing for some readers will be Saramago's depiction of God as a master manipulator, pulling the strings behind the scenes, needing the devil as a foil for his own glory because he knows that without the devil, his glory is diminished.  What kind of God is this?<br /><br />One can't help but wonder, while reading this book, what was Saramago trying to say to us?  Is the book a testimony to his own cynicism and atheism, or does Saramago believe in God and Jesus Christ in spite of himself?  Because his subject, Jesus as Man/God, comes out as eminently sympathetic, likeable, sometimes irritating, always fascinating; unlike the remote, other-worldly Jesus of Sunday school, Saramago's Jesus is someone we can relate to.  And Saramago's God echoes the question all of us have asked from time to time -- how can a benevolent God create a world in which the innocent are allowed to suffer?  It's Saramago's suggestion that perhaps God himself can't answer that one, that may disturb so many readers of this book.<br /><br />Saramago's writing style has been called convoluted, but it wasn't difficult at all for this reader; his paragraphs may go on for pages, but he writes with a sweep and flow that wraps the reader up and carries him or her right along with the narrative.  \\"The Gospel According to Jesus Christ\\" is totally enveloping; one turns the final page and emerges slightly dazed at having been through a reading experience that blows both the mind and the senses.<br /><br />Judy Linday go on for pages, but he writes with a sweep and flow that wraps the reader up and carries him or her right along with the narrative.  \\"The Gospel According to Jesus Christ\\" is totally enveloping; one turns the final page and emerges slightly dazed at having been through a reading experience that blows both the mind and the senses.<br /><br />Judy Lind	2003-06-06

Her detective agency is on solid footing although she's barely breaking even financially; she's become in institution in the community, her faithful fiance Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni is still faithful (are these two ever going to set the date??) and overall, life is good.  But there's a small cloud on the horizon; a pushy male detective who claims to be from the Big Apple sets up shop in town, loudly proclaiming that sleuthing is a man's business after all, and threatens to give Mma Ramotswe some serious competition.  But Mma. Makutsi, her trusty assistant, saves the day by scavenging some old typewriters and opening an adjunct business in their office, a typing school for men (what's the difference between a clerk and a secretary, except that men are called clerks and women are called secretaries, Mma. Makutsi reasons; after all, they both need to know how to type).  And next thing you know, business is booming, and one of Mma. Makutsi's students is making some serious moves on her.  Is love in the air?  Or is this guy maybe too good to be true?  It's up to Mma Ramotswe to find out, when she has time off from her search for two missing persons, and dealing with that pesky competition on the side.<br />Alexander McCall Smith brings Mma Ramotswe back onstage with all her formidable qualities very much in effect; her shrewd mother-wit, her common sense, and her uncanny intuition.  Like the first three book, \\"The Kalahari Typing School for Men\\" is an enchanting love poem to the people and the continent that so intrigues and fascinates Smith, and which he makes so fascinating for the rest of us.

There are two parallel and occasionally intertwining plots going on; one is the battle between the old forces that want to maintain the city of Ilh&eacute;us as it has been for decades, sleepy and backwards; and the people who want the city to join the 20th century by encouraging international trade and culture.  To the old guard, this is anathema; open the city to trade and all kinds of new ideas will rear their ugly heads.  The second plot involves the Syrian bartender Nacib Saab; poor Nacib has been deserted by his cook on the eve of catering an important party for the town's upper crust.  What to do?  Nacib ventures over to the part of town where desperate migrant workers fleeing the drought in Brazil's northern provinces will work for a pittance (it underscores their desperation and devastation that this place is called the \\"slave market\\") and finds Gabriela, a young mulatto woman, filthy, dirt-encrusted, but willing to work for next to nothing, and Nacib needs a cook.  But in Gabriela, he gets more than he ever bargained for.  Once she's washed free of the dirt and dust she is absolutely gorgeous; her cooking wakes visions of paradise, and soon she has most of the men in town, married and single, panting after her.  No way is Nacib, going to share this treasure he picked up off the dump heap; he wants her all to himself.  But the only way he can have her all to himself is by marriage.  Which is fine with him; but Gabriela is like an exquisite wild flower; once you pick it and put it in a vase, it withers and dies.  Gabriela loves being Nacib's cook and mistress; she hates being Mrs. Saab, having to mind so many P's and Q's.  She doesn't want to be a great lady; she just wants to be Gabriela.<br />Not only does the book have two great plots, it also has some terrific characters: the old reactionary Ramiro Bastos and his wastrel playboy son Tonico; Malvina Tavares, .who refuses to accept her mandated destiny of cloistered young woman and later resigned wife, and makes a destiny of her own; Mundinho Falçao, who arrives in Ilh&eacute;us bring the winds of change which are about to sweep out the fusty old order; Dr. Mauricio Caires, the reactionary lawyer fulminating hellfire and damnation; Colonel Amâncio Leal, another old reactionary who realizes it's time for a change; and a host of others.  But by far the most fascinating character is Gabriela herself, innocent, enchanting, full of the sheer joy of life.  It's a wonderful read, and the excellent translation by James L. Taylor and William Grossman from the original Portuguese into English does full credit to this marvelous book.oes the book have two great plots, it also has some terrific characters: the old reactionary Ramiro Bastos and his wastrel playboy son Tonico; Malvina Tavares, .who refuses to accept her mandated destiny of cloistered young woman and later resigned wife, and makes a destiny of her own; Mundinho Falçao, who arrives in Ilhéus bring the winds of change which are about to sweep out the fusty old order; Dr. Mauricio Caires, the reactionary lawyer fulminating hellfire and damnation; Colonel Amâncio Leal, another old reactionary who realizes it's time for a change; and a host of others.

The demand for her services are growing.  This time around, she's trying to locate a young American man missing in Botswana for ten years, nobody knows if he's still alive; dealing with the expansion of her household by the acquistion of two foster children her fiance, Mr. JLB Matekoni, was tripped into taking before he knew which end was up; investigating the evil machinations of Mr. JLB's housekeeper, and giving her secretary, Mma Makutsi, a well-deserved promotion to assistant detective.<br />As in the first book, Mma Ramotswe shares star billing with Africa itself, and in her we see the values that mean so much in this vibrant, diverse continent: the attachment to the land, the all-important love of family and neighborhood, the ethic of sharing one's good fortune with those less fortunate, and the homespun common-sense that motivates her daily activities.  She's not so much about solving crimes as she is about maintaining the harmony of an orderly existence.  For this reason, I don't consider this book or its predecessor as \\"crime novels\\".  Alexander McCall Smith isn't a crime writer; he's much more interested in Mma Ramotswe as a personality, and once again he's given us a quintessentially African protagonist in a quintessentially African book.	2003-04-17

Or does a kid assume the mantle of manhood automatically when he first fires a gun in war?  Vladislav Tamarov was a very young Russian soldier when he was sent to Afghanistan after being trained as a minesweeper and he kept a meticulous journal of his experiences in a hellacious corner of the world that he never wanted to go to.  He also took pictures.  Tamarov is a gifted writer, and in terse, spare sentences he tells us what it was like seeing your friends blown to bits and not knowing if or when your turn would come.  But it's the pictures that tell the story.  Young-old manboys with haunted eyes, grown too old before their time, some of them killed only hours after Tamarov took their photographs.  It's the unrealized promise in these faces that show all too clearly the terrible waste of war.  Reading this book is sharing a period of Tamarov's life that left him forever marked.  It's a searing account of war up close and personal. Very highly recommended.	2003-03-29

Precious Ramotswe is a comfortable size-22 African lady (none of your Euro/American size 6's for her, thank you very much) with a fund of mother-wit and a penchant for minding other people's business.  Having survived a disastrous, abusive marriage and the death of her infant son, she turns a small legacy from her late father, whom she adored, into \\"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency\\", the only one of its kind in Botswana, or maybe in all of Africa.  From shaky beginnings with non-paying clients and chauvinistic male attitudes (\\"Who ever heard of a woman detective?\\" demands a border policeman; \\"Haven't you ever heard of Agatha Christie?\\" Mma Ramotswe shoots back, not missing a beat), she builds up a small but solid clientele that brings her problems to solve concerning cheating husbands, wayward daughters, malingering employees trying to commit insurance fraud; and a spectacularly sinister case involving a missing eleven year old boy who may or may not have been murdered for witchcraft purposes.  Giving Mma Ramotswe quiet but ever-present moral support, while keeping her old car from falling apart, is Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni, who loves every inch of Mma Ramotswe's ample frame and is patiently waiting for the brick wall of her resistance to marriage to crumble, so she can make him the happiest man on earth.<br />Smith has written an enchanting book that is can be described as a cross between an engaging detective story and a love poem to Africa.  Mma Ramotswe is as warm and as solid as the red earth of Botswana; she loves every inch of the Africa she knows and identifies with and wouldn't live anywhere else.  She embodies the African traits of deep ties to family and community, concern for one's neighbors, and respect for tradition.  She commands respect and she gets it.  Smith has added a delightful and enduring creation to the pantheon of famous detectives in fiction.  Jane Marple, move over.  Or rather, make a separate space for Mma Ramotswe.  She deserves a pedestal of her own.of her own.	2003-03-22

Who does these kind of acts, and why?  Popular sociology has trotted out all kinds of explanations:  broken homes, TV violence, lack of old-fashioned values, permissiveness, bad neighborhoods, etc.; but whatever the supposed cause, it's been widely assumed that violent crimes are impulsive, unconsciously motivated, and predetermined.  In a well-researched study on the work of the criminologist Lonnie Athens, who grew up in a violent home and could just as easily have become one of his subjects, Richard Rhodes explores Athens' theory that violent behavior is learned, conditioned, and rather than being impulsive, is the result of prior planning.  Athens is firmly convinced that violent people know exactly what they are about and need to take full responsibility for their actions.  But how did they get that way?  Athens argues that severe violent behavior is the end-stage of a four-stage process beginning in childhood that he calls \\"violentization\\".  At any stage, the process may be interrupted and a person turned away from a life of violence; but once the fourth stage has been completed and violentization has been internalized, the pattern is set and the damage is done.  Rhodes shows that this process can begin in very early childhood, as it probably did with Perry Smith, Alex Kelly (the preppie rapist) and Mike Tyson; or it can begin relatively late, as was the case with young grunts who were de-socialized in Vietnam and learned to rape and kill defenseless civilians with gusto; Rhodes speculates that up to a third of Vietnam vets suffer long-term emotional damage directly resulting from their service in Vietnam that may remain with them for the rest of their lives.  The problem I have with Rhodes' otherwise excellent book is that he and Athens appear to assume that without exception violent people have suffered from the same process of violentization; and if the subject denies having gone through this process, he or she is either consciously lying or unconsciously in denial.  Ted Bundy, one of the most pathological personalities of the late 20th century, who seems to have enjoyed stalking his victims (all young women) almost as much as killing them, may have been a significant exception.  The question of what makes some people incorporate violence as a lifestyle while others turn away from it has still not been unraveled in all its complexity, but Athens' work with violent offenders has helped us understand it to a significant extent.zation; and if the subject denies having gone through this process, he or she is either consciously lying or unconsciously in denial.

From the time she was a little girl, Eva has been the target of random and senseless sexual assaults:  Freddy with his popsicle stick, her neighbor Mr. Logan who attacked her in a stairwell when she was still a child; her mother's paramour; her cousin Alfonso; her husband twenty years her senior who treated her like a virtual prisoner.  Eva has never known what it is to be loved and cared for by a decent, caring man.  But she's hit rock bottom when she meets Davis, who uses her like a rented prostitute and won't let her out of his hotel room until he's finished with her; he won't even give her a comb for her hair.  She's been debased to a piece of property to be used and thrown away.  But Eva's had more than enough, and she takes a devastating revenge.  She's not just paying back Davis alone for what she's been through; he's just the instrument:  Eva wants revenge at every man who ever looked at her, touched her, treated her as something less than human.<br />Like Eva's cellmate, Elvira, we are at once fascinated and repelled by Eva's crime and her tortured life that drove her to commit it.  Gayl Jones makes us feel all Eva's pain and her disgust and horror at the men who used her and treated her with such contempt.  Eva was a walking time bomb; we can only wonder that she didn't explode earlier.  But murder doesn't ease Eva's pain, and there's no escape for her.  Lonely and devastated, Eva needs love like any other human being, but love is something she'll never find; instead, she's stuck in a cell with Elvira, who is as predatory as the men on the outside who ruined her life.  Eva has survived, but at a devastating cost; she's become one of the walking dead.<br />In 177 spare pages, Jones paints a convincing portrait of a soul so damaged that even the gift of a comb would be an unhoped-for kindness.  \\"Eva's Man\\" is a short book but it's not easy to get through; Jones slices back and forth between time and place, mirroring Eva's fractured, fissured life.  It's a tough, gritty, no-holds-barred book by a uniquely gifted novelist.back and forth between time and place, mirroring Eva's fractured, fissured life.

Anything to do with numbers has me ready to break out into hives.  So it was with some trepidation that I opened this book, only to find that I had dived into a trove of fun and facts for all ages.  Enzensberger takes us on a magical ride through the world of primary numbers, square roots (rutabagas, for those who don't like boring old roots), triangle numbers, exponents, permutations and other mathematical formulae, and shows how numbers can be as infinitely fascinating as they are infinite in themselves.  The book is written for youngsters but it would be a great teaching tool for any math teacher from grades four through eight, and it's also fun for us grown-ups who would rather swallow a dose of castor oil than a math problem.  If this book had been around when I was a child, it would have been a sure preventive for the terminal case of math anxiety I developed somewhere in the ninth grade.  It's funny, original and informative.  Makes me want to fool around with those Bonacci numbers some more...	2003-03-13

Well, maybe not in anyone's family; most Americans aren't wealthy enough to live in a McMansion in an upper-middle-class bedroom community nor do most families own a boat; but income aside, the Jarretts are like most people one knows: a hardworking father, a mother who wants the best for her family, and two teenage sons, one outgoing and confident, the other quiet and retiring, living in his older brother's shadow.  A freak boating accident leaves the older brother dead by drowning, and the family devastated.  The parents, Cal and Beth, and their younger son Conrad, are left to cope with the aftermath.  \\"Ordinary People\\" is the story of how they cope - or fail to.<br /><br />When the story opens, Conrad has been referred to a psychotherapist following hospitalization for a suicide attempt, after his depression over his brother's death becomes more than he can deal with.  Conrad is suspicious, withholding, resentful; he's out of the hospital and no longer deemed a threat to himself, so why should he talk to this guy?  But the shrink seems okay, he doesn't push or pry; he'll let Conrad open up when he's ready.  And gradually, Conrad opens up.<br /><br />But the more Conrad opens up, the more his mother, Beth, retreats into the wall of denial she has built up around herself.  Beth is by far the most fascinating character in this book; fundamentally insecure emotionally, she has reacted by creating a world in which all is perfection: she's the perfect wife and mother, the perfect hostess, presiding over the perfect home in the perfect suburban community.  There's no room for mess or disorder in her world.  Her older son's death broke her perfect world apart.  But her younger son's suicide attempt trashed it.  This woman is so self-centered that she takes his action as a personal affront; he did it to hurt her.  And so Conrad not only has to work through the anguish of his brother's death, but also the pain of his mother's rejection.<br /><br />Guest is a skilled writer and she makes her characters live and breathe; we see Conrad in all his anguish and adolescent awkwardness, working through pain and grief to realize that some things can't be explained or rationalized; they just are.  Conrad's father, Cal, a self-made individual, is devastated by the family tragedy but strong enough to be there for Conrad when he needs him.  It's Beth, whose uncompromising rigidity appears to hold her up through the immediate aftermath of the funeral, who will ultimately crack under her inability to let go and externalize her pain.<br /><br />\\"Ordinary People\\" shows us how ordinary individuals and families can come undone by events beyond their control.

Do these individuals inhabit the same world the rest of us live in?  What is it that drives one to relentlessly stalk and murder other human beings like a tiger hunting prey?  And even tigers kill only to satisfy a physical hunger; what kind of hunger drives the likes of Ted Bundy?  Power?  Sadism?  Something so hideous that a \\"normal\\" mind can't begin to fathom it?  We wonder what it would be like to live inside the head of such a person, but at the same time we pull back: it probably wouldn't be very nice in there.<br />Hugh Aynesworth, an investigative reporter, and Stephen G. Michaud, a writer for Newsweek, have written an exhaustive, well documented account of Ted Bundy's rampage through four states that left at least thirty young women dead.  They explore Bundy's life in detail from his problematic childhood to his college years, during which he developed his consummate skill as a con artist and pathological liar.  He wasn't every teenage girl's dream, but he had his share of girlfriends; he came from a broken home but his mother clearly cared about him and tried to be a good parent.  He didn't know his father, but neither did a million other boys who never went on to become serial murderers.  So who or what made Bundy Bundy?  Aynesworth and Michaud suggest that it doesn't matter, Bundy was Bundy, period, and as such, the blame and responsibility for his crimes rest with him alone.<br />We follow Bundy in this book from his first murder in Washington State, through subsequent homicides in Utah and Colorado, his sensational escape from custody by jumping out of a second floor window, and his flight to Florida, where in a single explosion of homicidal rage he bludgeoned two girls to death and severely battered three more after invading their sorority house, before his final murder of a 12 year old who disappeared from a junior high school.  The last killing represented a chilling turn: was Bundy going after younger and younger prey?  One wonders if he might not have abducted children from elementary schools before he was finally caught.<br />Like all psychopaths before him and those who will come after him, Bundy never had a shred of compassion or guilt in regard to any of his victims.  When he related his crimes to Michaud and Aynesworth, he insisted on talking about himself in the third person, as if Bundy the killer was a separate entity unrelated to himself.  Perhaps that's how he could live with himself during the four years his crime spree lasted: someone else was committing these murders, not him.  However Bundy tried to rationalize, deny or explain away his actions, one gets through this excellent book emotionally drained, and feeling very grateful that he is no longer on this planet to remind us of the insanity he caused while he walked among us.hool.

Lawrence Block, who originally published this book under the pseudonym Paul Kavanaugh, brings us Jimmie John Hall, 22 years old, a drifter and loser who appears in the story's opening pages by hitching a ride with a friendly stranger and killing him for his Oldsmobile Toronado.<br /><br />Cut to Grand Island, Nebraska, where we meet Betty Dienhardt, a 15 year old nonentity, so mediocre she's practically invisible, living with her cold, unloving father, her submissive and equally unloving mother, and her flatulent grandmother whose malodorous gas explosions make the house almost uninhabitable.  Betty hates her home and wants to run away to her older sister Judy, who ran away from home years ago after a tempestuous fight with their father and has made a life for herself that her younger sister can only dream about; she fantasizes that Judy is a glamorous Hollywood actress who will drive up in a gleaming car and rescue her from this sink of despair she lives in.  Jimmie John's route takes him through Grand Island and when he runs into Betty, they each sense something in each other that they vibrate to.  Betty runs off with Jimmie John after he shoots her parents dead (and puts Grandma out of her misery as well), and from there it's a flight across the Southwest, leaving a trail of dead bodies in their wake.<br /><br />We learn about Jimmie John and Betty mainly from flashbacks told by people who knew them; a former lover of Jimmie John's mother, one of Betty's teachers who says that aside from excelling in Spanish she was so ordinary that she faded into the woodwork, and the sister Betty idolized, who says that she hardly remembers her, and they were never close anyway.  Block shows us who Betty and Jimmie John are, but we don't really get a sense of how they feel and where they are coming from, or why Betty chose not to escape from Jimmie John when she had a chance to, an act that ultimately dooms her.<br /><br />It's an interesting book in its own right, though, and shows us two rebels without a cause in a mindless quest for something they themselves are unaware of and could never reach anyway.  Block wrote this book from the viewpoint of a news reporter giving a voiceover narrative, and we finally see Jimmie John meeting his end as Starkweather himself did, as the scene fades slowly to black.<br /><br />Judy LindBetty chose not to escape from Jimmie John when she had a chance to, an act that ultimately dooms her.

They didn't test blood for HIV back then (how far away it all seems now) and Amanda got a dose of contaminated blood that has been slowly, invisibly, but all too relentlessly killing her.  She's looking forward to sixth grade, she's a star gymnast on her school team, but all of a sudden she's hit by nausea, night sweats, and a host of other opportunistic infections.  When her doctor, a family friend, gives her parents the diagnosis, it impacts on the family with all the force of a detonating bomb.  But this is only the beginning.  This is the 80's when the word AIDS sent ordinarily sensible people into mindless hysteria.  Amanda's brother is eight years old and healthy, but his best friend's mother won't let her boy associate with him any more; what if he touched something Amanda touched?  The principal of Amanda's school has to deal with frightened parents who think Amanda should be expelled to protect their own children.  And the family finds themselves gradually but inexorably isolated: on Halloween night, no one comes knocking for trick or treat.<br />Hoffman doesn't play cheap with the reader's emotions but this story is a heartbreaker anyway; it reaches us on a visceral level as we watch a vibrant pre-teen on the cusp of life dying slowly of a terrible illness, all too aware of what lies ahead of her, frightened and trying not to be, and knowing that, for all the love and support she gets from her family, ultimately she is in this alone.  She writes sparely, almost sparsely, but she packs a truckload of emotions into every sentence.  Perhaps the most gut-wrenching scene in the book is when Amanda gets her last wish to have her braces removed, looks into the mirror, and smiles, because she realizes that, if she could live to grow up, she would have been beautiful.e in the book is when Amanda gets her last wish to have her braces removed, looks into the mirror, and smiles, because she realizes that, if she could live to grow up, she would have been beautiful.	2003-03-04

From his first wife, Katherine of Arag&oacute;n, the Spanish princess to whom he was happily married for 24 years until her failure to produce a male heir to the throne led him to throw her on the dump heap, to Katherine Parr, who managed to survive his temperamental outbursts and suspicion and who ultimately buried him, Weir shows us these women not only as queens and consorts, but as women with distinct personalities and characteristics which helped some to survive while dooming others.<br /><br />The first two wives are presented in greatest detail; we see Katherine of Arag&oacute;n, devoutly Catholic, not only suffering private agony as a soon-to-be discarded wife about to be thrown over for a younger and more attractive woman, but genuinely concerned that Henry is jeopardizing his immortal soul by divorce and remarriage; and Anne Boleyn, whose one great accomplishment was producing the greatest monarch in English history, Elizabeth I; headstrong, devious, fatally impulsive, rising out of nowhere to the pinnacle of success and ending her days on the execution block.  In shorter chapters we also see Jane Seymour, the great love of Henry's life, giving him his only son and dying tragically young; his rebound marriage to Anne of Cleves, whom he loathed at first sight, dumping her for Katherine Howard, a teenage airhead who lost her head on the block for adultery right under the king's nose; and Katherine Parr, amiable, level-headed, sensible enough to put up with the aging king's increasing suspicion and cruelty by keeping a low profile, and ultimately, along with Anne of Cleves, surviving him.<br /><br />As a matter of fact, for this reader the most interesting of the six wives was Anne of Cleves, generally dismissed in the history books as a klutz with a passing resemblance to a horse, whose only crime was succeeding Henry's most beloved consort.  Anne may not have been a raving beauty, but it's to Henry's discredit that he was unable to appreciate her as a gracious, good-natured, sensible woman, a good stepmother to his three children.  Well regarded and respected by the extended royal family, she ended her days as the most successful of the six wives, rich, independent, and generally content.

In 456 fascinating pages, they bring us the blow-by-blow of the downfall of Richard Nixon and the Byzantine regime he created while serving as our 37th president.  The first part of the book gives us the background of the Watergate mess and how Nixon dug himself deeper and deeper in, through lies, deception, and more lies to cover up the lies he had already told.  We watch almost awestruck as this chief executive shoots off each of his toes in turn, then both feet, then both legs...  we want to open up his cranium and peer into the mind of this tortured man and find out what in the world was he thinking of when he actually bugged himself, showing himself in all his ugliness and venality.  Did this man even think, or was his denouement a series of blind reactions to events of his own making that did him in?  The end of part one brings us to the final lit fuse that will blow the Nixon presidency wide open:  the decision of seven Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee that they will vote with the majority Democrats to impeach a Republican president for obstruction of justice.<br />From there, the demise of Nixon was an ordained conclusion, but Woodward and Bernstein follow it to its end in part two, which is a day to day account of the final seventeen days of Nixon's presidency.  The House Judiciary Committee votes to bring a recommendation of impeachment to the full House of Representatives, and the Supreme Court rules unanimously that Nixon cannot take shelter behind the specious shield of executive privilege and refuse to release the tapes that document his complicity.  Nowhere to run, and nowhere to hide... We watch Nixon's fellow Republicans abandoning him one by one as the evidence of his complicity piles up and he realizes he has no support any more, nothing to fall back on.  The excruciating scene of his meeting with Kissinger after he has decided to resign his presidency rather than be ignominiously kicked out is gut-wrenching; we are both fascinated and repelled by Kissinger's evident lack of discretion and sensitivity in telling it afterwards, as he must have done.  In the end, we almost feel for this man who has fallen from the highest office in the world into a disgrace which will remain with him for the rest of his life; abandoned by most of his former friends and allies, despised by a wife who hasn't loved him for years, and supported only by the blind devotion of his children... until we read his farewell speech to the nation and shake our heads as we realize that, at the end of his presidency all the way to the end of his life, Nixon simply did not get it.of his meeting with Kissinger after he has decided to resign his presidency rather than be ignominiously kicked out is gut-wrenching; we are both fascinated and repelled by Kissinger's evident lack of discretion and sensitivity in telling it afterwards, as he must have done.

The police notify the press.  And two young reporters from the Washington Post begin to investigate what looks like a third-class, amateurish crime and end up ripping the lid off the biggest can of worms in American history.<br />We watch in fascination as Woodward and Bernstein follow their mentor Ben Bradlee's precept of \\"If you can't find a woman in the story, look for the dough\\".  We follow them as they chase the trail of laundered \\"dough\\" all the way into the White House.  And along with them, we peel off the outer leaves of the artichoke one by one - the underlings who committed the crime, their superiors who planned it, the higher-ups who authorized it, until the ugly center stands exposed: the Chief Executive as Thief in Chief.  Whether or not Nixon knew about the break-in in advance is irrelevant.  What matters is that once the news was out, he did everything possible to cover it up, and by doing so, sank himself irreversibly in a morass of crime and deception.<br />The book reads like a classic detective novel, with the intangible presence of Deep Throat looming over all.  Did he really exist, and if so, who was he?  The question still puzzles us. Woodward and Bernstein have been playing cat-and-mouse with us over his identity for the last three decades.  It's just one of the threads in this story that will be left dangling for years to come.<br />Woodward and Bernstein emerged from the Watergate scandal as American heroes.

Faber brings to life Victorian England in all its prim and starch propriety while showing the ugliness underneath.  The protagonist is Sugar, a very young prostitute, who specializes in satisfying her customer's most perverse desires (there is absolutely nothing she won't do), while at the same time ventilating her loathing and contempt of all men in a secret novel she will never publish.  She manages to fascinate William Rackham, the second son of a wealthy family who will inherit the perfume business that will make him rich and famous.  Rackham is respectably married to a young woman whose tenuous hold on reality diminishes until it slips away to nothingness; he also wants Sugar on the side and installs her first in a private pied-a-terre where she will be at his constant beck and call, and then in his own home as his six year old daughter's governess.  But Rackham turns out to be just as contemptible as every other man who used Sugar for his own satisfaction and then discarded her; when he impregnates Sugar, he turns her out into the street.  But Sugar isn't about to go empty-handed, and she wreaks a devastating revenge.  What that revenge is, is for some reason cut short at the end of the book like a TV show interrupted by a power failure; we're left dangling and infuriated.  This alone makes me give the book four stars instead of the five it would have earned if Fagen had given us a sense of what became of his characters.  The book doesn't even have an ending, we're left hanging indefinitely over a precipice.  A poor termination (I can't say &quot;ending&quot; because it's not one) of an otherwise excellent book.	2002-12-26

Based on the results of a U.S. Government project in the 1930's to capture the memories of living former slaves on tape, this awesome book is the history of slavery in the United States by those most qualified to tell it -- the blacks who actually lived it.  And by telling their stories, we live through it with them; we feel what it must have been like to have your family members sold away from you, to be forced into cohabitation with a fellow slave you despised for the sole purpose of breeding new slaves, to be treated like a beast of burden, and the crushing indignity of being a piece of property to be treated however your master's whim takes him.  The former slaves remembered it all, and their reminiscences aren't pretty: &quot;For miles around you could hear those dreadful whuppins.  They were a turrible part of livin'.&quot;  We hear their voices through the dark years of Reconstruction, which for many former slaves was escaping out of one hell and landing into the next, and we hear the stark statement of one old man who sums up the results of all his labor, paid and unpaid, over the decades:  &quot;Ain't got nothin, ain't got nothin, ain't got nothin.&quot;  And finally, we can only wonder at the strength and resilience of so many who claimed their humanity after so many years of being treated as something less than human, and who managed to not only survive, but to keep on keepin' on.	2002-12-26

But how does Huck reach this epiphany and who did Twain base his character on?  In a solidly researched and fascinating book, Shelly Fishkin posits that Huck was based on two young African-Americans Twain knew personally, one a ten year old boy named Jimmy and the other a young slave in Missouri named Jerry.<br /><br />Jimmy was described in Twain's newspaper article &#34;Sociable Jimmy&#34;, which was published in The New York Times in November of 1874.  Jimmy's family was employed in a village inn where Twain was staying, and Twain was clearly fascinated by &#34;the most artless, sociable and exhaustless talker I ever came across... I listened as one who receives a revelation.&#34;  Twain invited Jimmy to sit and chat, and Jimmy planked himself down in an easy chair and proceeded to regale Twain with stories about his family in the inn; in particular, their aversion to having cats around.  &#34;When dey ketches a cat bummin' aroun' heah... dey snake him into de cistern -- dey's been cats drownded in dat water dat's in yo' pitcher.  I seed a cat in dare yistiddy -- all swelled up like a pudd'n.&#34;  (Imagine the look on Twains face as Jimmy fed him this tidbit.)  As Fishkin shows, Jimmy and Huck share some key characteristics.  They both launch into long family narratives to hold their listener's attention.  They both have a visceral loathing of violence and cruelty, and they speak with a remarkable similarity.  The are both &#34;unpretentious, uninhibited, easily impressed and unusually loquacious.&#34;  When we close our eyes and listen to Jimmy, we can easily hear Huck in Jimmy's voice.<br /><br />Jerry was young black man in the 1850's who Twain idolized when he was himself a teenager, much to the dismay and disgust of Twain's mother.  Actually, Mom could be a stand-in for Tom Sawyer's Aunt Polly, who didn't want Tom associating with Huck because he was unwashed, uncouth, and the envy of every boy in the neighborhood of good family who admired him and wished they dared to be like him.  Here we see Huck as Jerry.  Jerry was a master at &#34;signifying&#34;, or indirectly satirizing whatever he held in contempt.  There is a lot of Jerry in the characters of both Huck and Jim, who compensate for their lack of formal education with a large store of mother-wit and down to earth common sense.<br /><br />We don't know if Twain directly based Huck on Jimmy and/or Jerry, and it may be impossible to determine for certain.  But there are enough similarities in all three characters to make the point that Twain thoroughly liked and respected both Jimmy and Jerry, and turned some of the best qualities of each of them into one of the most endearing and enduring people in all of American fiction.<br /><br />Judy Lindquacious.&#34;  When we close our eyes and listen to Jimmy, we can easily hear Huck in Jimmy's voice.

Set right after Pearl Harbor, it's the story of the Marines in the Second World War and of one squad of Marines in particular, led by (and narrated by) Mac, a crusty old sergeant who has seen generations of boys pass through his command.<br /><br />The story moves quickly through basic training to combat, and comes to a shattering climax with an all-out battle against the Japanese forces in the Pacific.  As much as the story Uris tells so compellingly, we are held by his characters: Danny Forrester, the all-American boy; Andy the Swede, hating women indiscriminately until he meets the woman of his dreams far from home; Levin from Brooklyn, who knew what he had to do, and did it magnificently; Shining Lighttower, the Navajo, who really didn't want to go back to the reservation after all, and Sam Huxley, their colonel, who wanted glory for himself and his boys at any price, even if the price included all their lives.<br /><br />Technically, Uris isn't a very good writer, but he is one helluva storyteller, and one of his greatest strengths is in plain dialogue between his characters, which shows up to much better advantage here than it did in his later books.  It's in the dialogue that his characters come vibrantly alive; we understand how a disparate bunch of 18 and 19 year olds, kids like anybody else, can throw their lives away in battle rather than face the possibility of a defeat which would be worse than death.  Uris shows us through his characters the men who made the Marines what they are.<br /><br />Judy Lind	2002-11-05

There are full page and double-page photos galore, and some foldout plates that will literally take your breath away.  Shirakawa took his photographs at all hours of the day and night; we see the Himalayas in all their majesty in the muted shades of dawn, glowing crimson and purple at sunset, sharply etched at high noon, snow and ice crystals glittering like an overturned jewel box, and lushly green valleys in the foothills.  The book is divided into four sections representing the Nepal, Punjab and Sikkim Himalayas, and the Hindu Kush range in India.  The text is absorbing and relates the geographical evolution of the Himalayas, as well as giving us a brief look at the history and culture of the people who live in their shadow.  But the text is a pale shadow to the incredible, magnificent pictures.  Looking at these awesome photographs, one can almost believe in the existence of Shangri-La.	2002-11-01

The time is 1940 and the place is England just after the retreat from Dunkirk; in the memorable words of Winston Churchill, it was their finest hour.<br /><br /> At the center of the book is Laurie Odell, wounded in action, waking up in a military hospital to the fact that he will be crippled for life.  The problem for Laurie is that he fears being emotionally crippled as well.  Laurie is a graduate of a rigid British prep school where the head boy, Ralph Lanyon, was the object of his hero worship; Ralph is kicked out in a sensational scandal involving a hysterical accusation of homosexual activity with another boy in the school.  Laurie is sexually attracted to Ralph and when Ralph is expelled, he realizes that the attraction was mutual, but that Ralph never approached him because he knew better than Laurie himself did that Laurie hadn't awakened to his own sexual orientation yet, and Ralph was not about to take that responsibility for him.  While recuperating in the hospital, Laurie meets Andrew, a young conscientious objector who looks up to him as Laurie had looked up to Ralph.  Andrew, however, is a total innocent, and his uncompromising religious views would make him look upon homosexual love as an abomination, even while he is attracted to Laurie.  While on leave from the hospital, Laurie runs into Ralph, whom he hadn't seen since he was expelled from prep school seven years earlier, and learns that it was Ralph who piloted the navy boat that rescued him from Dunkirk.  Ralph has been wounded as well, however, having had half his hand shot off, so the two of them are basically free and unfettered to start a relationship.<br /><br />Ralph has grown hard and cynical after seven years of searching for love with increasingly superficial partners, and he has hit rock bottom with his current partner, whose sole attraction is his dazzling good looks.  The attraction between Ralph and Laurie is immediate and compelling, and throws Laurie into a dilemma: he can hook up with Ralph and face up to the fact of his homosexuality which he has been hiding from everyone, including himself; or he can remain on a platonic basis with Andrew and remain sexually frustrated.  At the core of his problem is trying to resolve how one can be gay and maintain his integrity at the same time.  After meeting some of Ralph's associates, he isn't so sure.  Laurie doesn't want to be dragged into the gay milieu, and Ralph sees Laurie as his means of escape from that milieu, and the bottom line for them both is, are they homosexual men, or are they men who happen to be homosexual.<br /><br />Things get complicated when Laurie tells Ralph about Andrew (one of the things that attracts Ralph to Laurie is his fundamental honesty) and although he understands Laurie's dilemma, Ralph isn't about to let him off the hook; he tells Laurie that he has a choice: he can continue to help Andrew tell lies to himself about himself, or he can help Andrew face up to what he is.  Laurie doesn't want that responsibility with Andrew any more than Ralph wanted it with him seven years earlier, and he temporizes until someone intervenes and Andrew has to face his own nature up close and personal.  The resulting explosion shakes everyone up; Laurie finally realizes that being human ultimately means being true to oneself.  What that means for Laurie is resolved at the end of the book.<br /><br />There are several interesting secondary characters in the story, including Alec, one of Ralph's previous partners, decent, honest, but unable to commit more than superfically, and Sandy, Alec's current partner, insecure, demanding, jealous, but also capable of love, and Bunny, Ralph's latest, despicable, devious, and totally amoral.  But the three main characters are the most compelling: Andrew, whose rigid, unbending morality finally makes him snap; Ralph, hard, jaded, yet with a core of innocence and trust that still makes him believe that love is not a myth; and Laurie himself, trying to resolve who he is and what he stands for as a man and as a human being.  For all its being a World War II story, the problems and issues are timeless and make the book as fresh today as it was 60 years ago when it was first issued.

Alas, this book is more like a banglet; it's not a whimper, but not nearly the pyrotechnics he's shown us he's capable of.<br /><br />The book starts off very well indeed; a mysterious stranger pulls up to a gas station in a Buick, gets out, and disappears; the Buick turns out to be portal into another dimension that sounds like a very King-ian hell.  Occasionally, weird, loathsome, obnoxious critters come out of that hell via the Buick, and humans have been drawn into it via the same route.<br /><br />What makes this book a disappointment is that King has developed an annoying habit of pulling his punches.  He gives us a tantalizing glimpse of that netherworld, but glimpses is all we get; the old Stephen King would have dragged us into it kicking and screaming and showed it to us in all its unspeakable horror.  King used to write real horror novels; \\"Buick 8\\" is much more frustrating than frightening.  I think I'll re-read a few of his early books such as \\"Salem's Lot\\", \\"Needful Things\\", and most especially \\"Pet Sematary\\", to remember what King was like when he was really at his best.<br /><br />Judy Lind	2002-10-19

When the book opens, one year after the end of the third book, the three oldest children are off to boarding school and Randy and Oliver are facing a lonely, boring winter by themselves, until a mysterious letter written on blue paper arrives in the mail, containing the first clue to what will be a year-long treasure hunt.  The clues are funny and entertaining, and the adventures Randy and Oliver get into, going from one clue to the next, are enjoyable.  But we miss the presence of Mona, Rush and Mark except during the brief period they are home from school for the Christmas holidays, and the adults in the family, Father, Cuffy and Willie, aren't quite enough to take up the slack.<br /><br />One thing about \\"Spiderweb\\" that sets it apart from the first three books is the lack of a time frame.  Enright wrote the first three during World War II and the war is at the center of the family's lives and is present in each book; the children are busy presenting a show and working after school to buy war bonds and going on scrap metal drives during the summer holiday.  The first three books take place from the later winter and early spring of 1942, through the end of the summer of 1943.  But although \\"Spiderweb\\" runs from October of 1944 to June of 1945, the war is never even referred to in the book.  Even V-E Day in May of 1945 which would have been celebrated all over town, isn't mentioned.  Perhaps this is because Enright wrote \\"Spiderweb\\" ten years after she wrote the third book and many of her readers hadn't been born during the war; but still, some mention of the events would have given the book a dimension that is present in the first three but lacking in this one.<br /><br />Another problem with \\"Spiderweb\\" is that Enright seems reluctant to let some of her characters grow up.  She's wonderful when she writes about children, but she seems uncomfortable when they turn into teenagers.  She doesn't even mention Randy's age in the book, although we know Randy is four and half years older than Oliver, which means she's already thirteen.  But Randy shows no interest in boys, movie stars, popular music, or any of the things thirteen year old girls normally obsess about.  Mona comes home for vacation talking about \\"When I grow up I want to be...\\" come on!  No young lady going on seventeen talks about \\"when I grow up\\", in their minds they're already grown up.  Enright's young characters seem to be caught in a time warp, frozen in time as children.<br /><br />When I turned the last page of \\"Spiderweb\\" after reading it as a child, I was devastated to realize that there would be no more Melendy books.  But Enright had the right idea; the next year would have seen Randy herself going off to boarding school and Mona off to college, leaving Oliver rattling around the Four Story Mistake by his lonesome.  A depressing prospect indeed.  Enright knew where to end it.<br /><br />Judy Linde writes about children, but she seems uncomfortable when they turn into teenagers.

I grew up with \\"The Tall Book of Make-Believe\\" and passed it on to my son, and it's a shame to deprive the current crop of preschoolers of this marvelous book. The book's name describes it: it's tall, skinny, easy for young readers to hold, and chock full of stories, poems, riddles, rhymes, fun and nonsense to fascinate any child.  I still remember \\"Bad Mousie\\", a devilish little rodent who delighted in trashing the premises, and Georgie the ghost who had to camp out in a barn while looking for a house to haunt.  Garth Williams's illustrations lend a true touch of make-believe.  It's a book that belongs on every child's shelf and it's well worth searching for.

Haven't we all?  That's probably why so many children fall in love with this book; we've all been there, even the very young ones, so they can relate just like we grownups can. From the first mishap in the early morning when he wakes up with last night's chewed gum stuck in his hair, to the final indignity of being rejected by the cat (who wants to sleep with his brother Anthony, not with him), with umpteen mishaps and misfortunes in between (lima beans for supper? Yuck.  Kissing on TV? Double-yuck!), Alexander's day just gets worse and worse.  If you had a day like that, wouldn't you want to hop the first jet to Australia?  Judith Viorst has an uncanny knack for being able to put herself in a five-year-old's shoes, and her book lets kids know that their feelings are valid and normal.  And at the book's end, Alexander -- and the youngsters -- realize that days like that are bound to happen, even in Australia.<br /><br />This is a great read-aloud book; the kids usually end up chanting (or shouting) along with the reader \\"It was a TERRIBLE!! HORRIBLE!! NO!! GOOD!! VERY!! BAD!! DAY!!\\" and Ray Cruz's pen and ink drawings are a delight and add to the fun.  I've read this book to several first-graders and each one of them clamored for a repeat.  This is one book that belongs on every child's bookshelf and will probably be treasured for years to come.<br /><br />Judy Lind	2002-08-23

Tom is a foundling who turns up in good Squire Allworthy's bed on the night he is born; he's given the surname of Jones because the household believes that his mother is Jenny Jones, a local lady of somewhat easy virtue.  Squire Allworthy, out of pity for the foundling, raises him as his own son, along with his loathsome nephew Blifil, but it looks like Tom and his supposed mother have more than a little in common.  To put it bluntly, Tom is no better than he should be.  He's wild, rowdy, a womanizer, perpetually in some kind of trouble; but his heart is in the right place even if he thinks with the wrong head most of the time.  He's kind, decent, affectionate, generous to a fault, everything his sneaky, tattle-tale, obnoxious cousin isn't.  He's also in love with his neighbor Squire Western's daughter Sophia, who is very much in love with him; but Western has decided that Sophia is to marry not Tom but Blifil, and Sophia can't stand the creep.  So when Tom is turned out of Allworthy's house on a trumped-up charge of aiding and abetting a criminal, Sophia runs away from her father's house to avoid being forced into marrying Blifil, and they both make their separate ways to London, where the book's action culminates.<br />Fielding crafted his novel almost perfectly; of the 18 chapters in the book, the first third take place on Squire Allworthy's and Squire Western's country estates, the second third on the road to London, and the third in London itself.  In the exact middle of the book is the hilarious adventure at the inn at Upton, where all the characters, unknown to each other, briefly converge.  When the characters all come together in London, Tom finds out his real parentage, Blifil gets what he deserves, and the story, like all good stories, ends happily ever after.<br />The most common criticism leveled at Fielding and \\"Tom Jones\\" when it was first published was that it was crass, low-down and didn't set the high moral tone expected of writers of his time. Fielding pulled no punches in writing this book.  One of his most delicious characters is the hard-drinking, ham-fisted Squire Western, who has all the finesse of a bull in a china closet and calls it as he sees it (his description of Lady Bellaston is dead-on); and in Jenny Jones, he presents a lady of ill-repute in so sympathetic and likeable a way that she appeals to us much more than if she had been a prim and proper female.  But Fielding knows what moral and immoral really are; Tom Jones, for all his faults, is truly good, just as Blifil, for all his pious moralizing, is truly evil.  What's most refreshing about \\"Tom Jones\\" is that Fielding has presented us with characters that are truly believable; we see them in three dimensions, warts and all.  \\"Tom Jones\\" brings us 18th century England as it was; raw, vibrant, bursting with life and energy.

Books	5	1	1	N	N	They should have kept the title, but the book's still great	Ten lashes with a wet noodle to whoever changed the original fun title of \\"What Mrs. McGillicuddy Saw!\\" to the boring old \\"4:50 From Paddington\\".  Thank goodness they couldn't tamper with the delicious treat inside.  What Mrs. McGillicuddy saw is a murder outside her train window, on another train running parallel to hers.  However, not only can Mrs. McGillicuddy not convince anyone she saw a murder, they can't even find a body.  Whoever thought he was committing the perfect crime, however, didn't take into account Mrs. McGillicuddy's old friend, Miss Marple, eighty-plus years old and sharp as a tack, and Miss Marple knows that, body or no body, Mrs. McGillicuddy is no fool; if she says she saw a murder, somebody got murdered.  So all they have to do is: first, find the body, and second, find the murderer.  To help in her search (she's not getting any younger after all), Miss Marple enlists the aid of Lucy Eyelesbarrow, one of the best of Agatha Christie's creations, a brilliant, no-nonsense young woman who actually finds the victim, a young French woman, strangled and interred in a stone sarcophagus located in a beat-up old barn at Rutherford Hall, a run-down estate owned by crotchety old Mr. Crackenthorpe, who's in no hurry to expire and leave the estate to his three sons and his spinster daughter.  Someone's after the estate, though, and doesn't want to share the goodies either, because the body count starts to pile up at Rutherford Hall even as Miss Marple is unwinding the tangled skein of events that leads to a solution of the crime.  Agatha Christie seems to have had fun writing this book; it zips along like a runaway train and we're with it right to the end.  It's a shame Mrs. McGillicuddy never appeared in a subsequent book because she and Miss Marple are an inspired pairing; much more than Poirot's straight man, Hastings, Mrs. McGillicuddy has a fund of plain common sense and mother-wit that compliment Miss Marple's shrewd insight and would make the two of them a terrific detective team.

Here is Hercule Poirot, the rotund Belgian detective, whom we meet in the restaurant car \\"trying to keep his mustaches out of the soup\\" as the Orient Express is about to begin its run across Central Europe.  Also on board are an English governess, a British colonel, an American pseudo-philanthropist and his multilingual secretary, a Russian grande dame, a Hungarian count, a garrulous American matron of certain age, and others representing various countries and nationalities.  During the night, one of the passengers is found murdered in his bed, and we learn the next morning that the victim was a vicious child kidnapper and murderer who richly deserved what he got.  But who gave it to him is the mystery to be solved.  It's the typical English parlor mystery transplanted to the exotic setting of the Orient Express, and it's a brilliant switch.  Enter Poirot, sifting through the facts, half-facts and outright inventions, until the mystery is unraveled and we find out not only whodunit, but also who Poirot's fellow passengers really are.  It's one of Christie's most satisfying novels, perfectly crafted, concisely written, and totally on target from first to last.	2002-07-03

The book leapfrogs back and forth without rhyme or reason; we don't really get into the plot; and the really interesting character, Wolf, not the book's pedestrian protagonist Jack Sawyer, doesn't remain in the story long enough to satisfy us.  The real problem with \\"The Talisman\\", though, is that the writers' styles don't mesh; they clash instead of complimenting each other and it gives the book a stilted and uncomfortable tone.  King and Straub are each fine writers on their own, but this book is ample testimony to the fact that two good writers don't necessarily add up to one good book.	2002-06-28

It's cram-jammed, chock-a-block with patterns that make your fingers itch to get hold of some yarn and let your creativity run wild.  Unlike the reader in Arlington, WA, I would never categorize this book as a \\"professional reference\\"; it's a must for anyone who likes to knit, from novice to expert.<br /><br />The genius of Barbara Walker's knitting books is her crystal-clear instructions and explanations; she makes it easy for anyone to follow.  Many of the designs in the \\"Second Treasury\\" are quite simple and any beginner could do them with no trouble; once you develop more skill and experience, you can move on to some of the harder patterns.  There are enough designs in this book to satisfy the rankest novice or the most experienced pro.  I also found the black/white photographs very helpful in showing the design details much more clearly than color photos would.  (In fact, some knitters make the mistake of combining too many pattern stitches with too many colors in one garment, and ruining the effect.)<br /><br />Like the first \\"Treasury\\", the \\"Second Treasury\\" is very well organized into different pattern groups, and includes some new groups such as mosaic patterns, which are really quite simple but the color effect is stunning.  Both \\"Treasury\\" books are invaluable references that will provide enough inspiration for a lifetime of enjoying this craft.<br /><br />Judy Lind	2002-06-09

Once you get past casting on and the basic knit and purl stitches, it's fun to start designing your own projects, and the \\"Treasury\\" makes this simple.<br /><br />It was the \\"Treasury\\" that turned me into a dyed-in-the-wool \\"knitwit\\".  It's mind-blowing to think that so many hundreds of patterns are varieties of just two fundamental stitches, the knit stitch and the purl stitch.  Let your imagination loose; there's no limit on what you can make.  The \\"Treasury\\" is organized into basic pattern groups, starting with simple knit-purl combinations, and advancing through ribbing, color-change patterns, slip stitch, twist stitch, and many more, all the way through lace and cable stitch patterns.  The directions are very clear and concise, and the photographs are excellent.  Walker doesn't give instructions for making different garments in this book, but she does explain how the patterns can be adapted to making just about anything.<br /><br />One of the best (for this reviewer) chapters was the one on cable stitch knitting; here Walker tells how to design and make your own original fisherman's sweater, using any number of different cable stitch patterns.  It sounded like so much fun that I decided to try it, and it came out so great that I promptly made another one, this time casting on from top to bottom and knitting the sweater sideways, so all the cables run horizontal.  Talk about an original!  This book really lets your creative genius loose.  Use it, enjoy it, and have a lot of fun.<br /><br />Judy Lind	2002-06-09

Richard Burton introduces us to Sharazad, that seductive storyteller who took the bull by the horns and dared to marry the sultan Shariyar who had been driven mad by the infidelity of his former wife and tried to exorcise the demons of her adultery by marrying a new wife every morning and slaying her that same night.  Sharazad knows that a good tale can tame the savage beast much in the way music can, and she keeps the Sultan enchanted night after night with the tales that still enchant us in our own time.  We all know about Aladdin and his magic lamp, and Ali Baba and the forty thieves, but there are loads of other treasures in this collection; my personal favorites, aside from Ali Baba, are the story of Ali the Persian (short, succinct, and very funny), and The Lady and Her Five Suitors, a hilarious tale of a woman who lures five men into a trap and then runs off with her boyfriend.  And Sharazad, smart lady that she is, took care to insure her own future; not only does she regale her sultan with a thousand and one tales in as many nights, she also presents him with three children during that time, wins the heart of the sultan, and, we suppose, lives happily ever after.<br /><br />No one knows where the tales originated. Burton suggests that the earliest may date from the 8th century A.D., and the latest may have been as recent as the 16th century, only 200 years before Antoine de Galland translated the tales into French and unfolded them like a magic carpet before the astonished and delighted eyes of his European readers.  Burton translated them into English in 1885 and they have been weaving their own spell of enchantment for us ever since.  When we open \\"The Arabian Nights\\" we step onto our own magic carpet and we're off on a ride of fun and fantasy that lasts until the last page when we close the book and come back down, reluctantly, to earth.<br /><br />Judy Lindhave been weaving their own spell of enchantment for us ever since.

To hear Sharazad Ali tell it, the black woman is a fat, funky, foul-mouthed, evil b-word who needs periodic physical abuse by black men to keep her in line.  She actually advocates, in print, black men slapping black women in the mouth whenever they talk back.<br />She also writes at great length about how black women neglect themselves and their appearance, and how much their hair and bodies stink.<br />Does Ms. Ali really believe this nonsense, or is she just writing this garbage to sell her book?<br />This book has got to be the most inane, irresponsible, and reprehensible piece of trash I have ever had the misfortune to come across.<br />If this is the opinion Ms. Ali really has of black women, and sadly enough, she herself is a black woman, then all I can say to Ms. Ali is, check yourself.	2002-06-02

I had to read several Greek plays in high school but they were always kind of ho-hum until Renault brought them vibrantly to life in \\"The Mask of Apollo\\" in the character of Nikeratos, an Athenian actor in 4th-century BC Greece who learns his craft from the ground up and brings us onstage and backstage into his world of great drama.  Nikeratos travels from Greece to Sicily and back, acting in plays by such immemorial dramatists as Aeschylus, Sophocles and Euripides, and bringing life to his art and art into his life and the lives of those he interacts with.  Parallel with the story of Nikeratos is the story of Dion of Syracuse, a real historical figure who successfully brought down the dictatorship of Dionysios the Younger, only to install his own dictatorship in its place.  \\"The Mask of Apollo\\" brings to life historical figures such as Plato, Aristotle, Speusippos (an enigmatic character I would have liked to know more of) and many others that we only read about in history texts, and makes them become real and personal.  She also makes us live in ancient Syracuse with its sights and sounds, its political intrigues and dangers.  (Contrary to what one reviewer said, however, Renault gave only one line in passing to the Athenian defeat at Syracuse during the Peloponnesian War and the tragic aftermath; that was treated at length in \\"The Last of the Wine\\" but not in this book.)  After finishing this book, I headed straight to the bookstore for a good translation of \\"The Bacchae\\" by Euripides, which I'd never heard of before Renault relates how brilliantly Nikeratos acts the leading role, and devoured it at one sitting.  Renault does her readers a double favor: she not only gives them a gem of a book, she sends them on a treasure hunt to find some more.	2002-05-30

Especially in the Olympics, the big draws were swimming and track, with gymnastics coverage relegated to the back of the sports pages.  But at the Munich Olympics in 1972, among the Russian gymnasts was a tiny 17 year old sprite named Olga Korbut who looked like an elf dangling from a charm bracelet and wowed the crowds in the gym, changing the face of gymnastics overnight.  Never mind that Korbut wasn't the best gymnast on the Russian team; she was a natural showgirl.  The crowds ate her up.  Olga's size (84 pounds) didn't hurt her appeal either.  There was a new face on female gymnastics and it was cute, petite, and above all, thin.  This was reinforced four years later at Montreal by Nadia Comaneci, who was not only petite, she was barely 14 years old.  Combining a formidable talent with an insatiable coach, Nadia tore up the gym to win three gold medals.  The formula for a winning gymnast was thus established: take them as young as possible, feed them as little as possible, and train them as hard as possible.<br /><br />Some girls thrived under this regime; many more cracked (or cracked up).  Ryan goes to convincing lengths in describing the results of this training on bodies that were for the most part far too young to handle it: eating disorders (including at least one death from anorexia); severe injuries, including permanent paralysis; and damaged psyches from dealing with demanding coaches and obsessed parents who live vicariously through their children.  She also points up that many coaches do not have the requisite training and experience to coach children without subjecting them to serious physical and emotional harm.  And she tells of the disillusionment felt by many young gymnasts when nature inevitably catches up, the inches and pounds increase, and they are jettisoned for a younger, shorter and thinner crop of aspiring competitors.<br /><br />Although Ryan's book is supposed to be about gymnasts and figure skaters, the latter don't get nearly as much attention, perhaps because they don't suffer as severe injuries as gymnasts and generally are older when they compete at the Olympics.  But her argument that age works against these girls does point up the case of Michelle Kwan, who was a 13 year old sensation at the world championships and stayed at the top of her sport until she was nineteen, when she started growing upwards and outwards and was upstaged and defeated by a 15 year old challenger named Tara Lipinski.  Ryan has researched her book carefully and perhaps it has had a beneficial effect; the minimum age for Olympic gymnastic competition has been raised to sixteen, and at the 2000 Olympic games, the girls looked much better fed than they did in 1996.  The one caveat I have about this book is that Ryan seems not to have to talked to any competitors who enjoyed their sport, who persevered because they enjoyed it and not because they were pushed or bullied into it.  Including some of these athletes would have made for a more balanced and ultimately a better book.<br /><br />Judy Lindspiring competitors.

La Isla, one of his lesser-known but best books, is set in the coastal city of M&aacute;laga and introduces us to a group of upper-class Spaniards and expatriates with too much money, too much free time, and a cynicism that seems to pervade every aspect of their lives.  They are surrounded by luxury in this Mediterranean jewel set in an arid surrounding of unrelieved poverty, but hedonists as they are, they don't know or care about anyone not like themselves.  At the center of the book is Claudia Estrada, through whose eyes the action unfolds, and her husband Rafael, a womanizing journalist with whom she has long ago fallen out of love.  We also meet Dolores V&eacute;lez, an aging but still beautiful actress, desperate to hang on to her philandering doctor husband Rom&aacute;n who couldn't care less about her; Laura, who hops from bed to bed in the series of one-night stands that make up her relationships; the American expatriate Ellen who cheats on her husband with half the male population of the city, and Enrique Olmos, Claudia's would-be lover, whose cynicism is a cover-up for a desperate problem that dooms their illicit relationship.  The action in the story takes place over a span of eleven days, during which Claudia examines her life, its emptiness, her reliance on meaningless social contacts to get her through the days and sleeping pills to get her through the nights; she realizes that she is going through the motions of living but is powerless to do otherwise.  One wonders, would her life have more meaning if she had children, a job, something to keep her focused off herself, or is she too self-centered to even want a family or a meaningful occupation?  At the book's end, Claudia is off to America when her husband receives a plum assignment as a foreign correspondent; we don't know how she will arrange her life in a new country or whether or not her sham of a marriage will stand or fall, and we realize that ultimately it makes no difference.

Oh yeah? say the editors; well, we'll go one better, we'll make a Plan of our own.  And they proceed to do so, by feeding bits and pieces of fact and fancy into a computer named Abu (for Abulafia, the medieval Jewish cabalist): the secrets of the Great Pyramid, the Knights Templar's initiation rites; Rosicrucian lore, and a few hefty sprinkles of Brazilian candombl&eacute;.  Hey, it's great fun and they're only playing a game, after all... until they discover that the game is playing them and they've unleashed a terrifying force they can neither harness nor understand.  Umberto Eco is not a so-called \\"popular\\" writer and this book is not for anyone looking for an easy read.  It has more twists and turns than a Chinese puzzle; it's dense, packed full of historical facts and references, and zips across time and geography until the reader has to slow down and reorient himself.

The family is the Kao clan, five generations living in one complex headed by the Venerable Master Kao, the ultimate autocrat, monarch of all he surveys within his walls, unwilling and unable to admit that his country and his family are changing before his eyes.  The story centers around three brothers in the younger generation; Chueh-Hsin, married against his will to a woman chosen for him by his family, stuck in a job he hates, also chosen by his family, trying to navigate through life with his \\"compliant bow\\" philosophy which dictates that he must not oppose his elders under any circumstances; Chueh-Min, the second brother, determined to marry the girl he loves despite his family's opposition, and the youngest brother, Chueh-Hui, who sees his family as a ball and chain, loathes everything they represent, and is chafing to break free and live his own life.  Pa Chin clearly identifies with Chueh-Hui; he rails against the stifling conformity of Chinese family life, which determines that everyone subordinate their will to the family elders; but in this reviewer's opinion, he doesn't give enough credit to the strengths in the same family life that held Chinese society together for thousands of years.

Mary Renault was one of the most successful historical novelists of the 20th Century and her Alexander novels were her masterpiece.  \\"Fire From Heaven\\" is the first of the trilogy that includes \\"The Persian Boy\\" and \\"Funeral Games\\", and tells us the story of Alexander the Great, one of the most fascinating and complex characters in all history, from early childhood to the age of twenty, when he succeeded his father as king of Macedon.  Renault brings us into Alexander's world and presents us to him in all his multifaceted personality: his all-consuming ambition, his sensitivity, his insatiable drive for excellence, and his love-hate relationship with his father (hate inexorably, and inevitably, won out) which was so influential in shaping his character and the course of his life.  Renault also brings us into the lives of Alexander's family, especially his mother Olympias, one of the most ruthless and devious characters in ancient history; totally wrapped up in her son and willing to stop at nothing to protect his interests.  Olympias might have eaten Alexander alive if it hadn't been for the influence of his friend and lover Hephaistion of whom she was wildly jealous; and Renault narrates the growing affection and love between the two boys as a natural development in their lives.  Homosexuality and bisexuality were normal in the ancient world (Julius Caesar himself was described by his contemporaries as \\"every woman's man and every man's woman\\") and Renault doesn't flinch at it, and neither should anyone who reads this book.  Renault's greatest strength as a historical novelist was her insistence on keeping it real, which was especially difficult in writing about Alexander's early life as almost nothing is known about him before his accession; but her research into the time and the place has the feel and sense of painstaking accuracy.  There is only one thing that makes me give this book four stars instead of five, and it's that, unlike her earlier novels, Renault wrote this one in the third person.  It doesn't work quite as well.  What was so magical about her earlier works was that when you read them in the first person, you don't just read them, you dive right into them and live them; you're right there in the middle of the action and it's totally exhilarating from the first page to the last.  Reading \\"Fire From Heaven\\" is like watching the action through a clear sheet of plate glass instead of being on the other side where the action is really happening.  Renault got it right in her second book, \\"The Persian Boy\\", which told about Alexander's life from his accession as king to his death at the age of 32; \\"Fire From Heaven\\" is an excellent prequel to what was to come.rote this one in the third person.

When Renault writes in the first person, something magical happens; we're so totally caught up in the action that we're inside the book, not only watching but feeling it come alive.<br /><br />Renault realizes that Alexander underwent a fundamental transformation on becoming Great King after defeating Darius at Gaugamela; he was no longer the king of Macedon but king of most of the known world, most of whose inhabitants were considered by Macedonians to be \\"barbarians\\", and she chose to tell her story through the eyes of one of them, the Persian eunuch Bagoas, an actual historical character of whom next to nothing is known except that he had been sold to Darius in childhood as a slave and after Darius's final defeat at Gaugamela was passed on to Alexander.  He must have made the most of his position as the historian Aristobulos wrote about Bagoas six years afterwards, when he was evidently still in Alexander's good graces, and had probably seen and heard a great deal.<br /><br />Renault had to fabricate almost all of Bagoas's own story; we see him as the beautiful child of a Persian nobleman who was betrayed and executed; sold into slavery and castrated to preserve his exquisite good looks, and then presented to Darius, standing by his king and seeing him betrayed and murdered by his own men after his defeat by Alexander, and then being passed on to this strange young Macedonian who looked more like a barbarian than the Persians looked to the Macedonians.  Renault's choice of a Persian narrator was inspired; who else could have told from a sympathetic viewpoint about Alexander's growing identification with his conquered subjects, and his insistence in finding excellence in people of all races and nationalities, when most Macedonians considered Persians as little more than subhuman?  Bagoas's love for Alexander doesn't blind him to Alexander's faults; he gives us Alexander warts and all; his overwhelming ego and conceit which must have driven his best friends up the wall; his hot temper and intemperance which led him to kill a trusted officer in a drunken rage, and the lack of moderation which made him a candle burning at both ends and ultimately burned him out.  And although Bagoas must have hated Hephaistion in real life and the feeling was probably mutual, he can still realize that Hephaistion's death removed a vital prop in Alexander's life and left him not only bereft, but with a vital part of himself gone without which he could no longer live.<br /><br />\\"The Persian Boy\\" brings us the ancient world from Asia Minor to India and makes it so incredibly alive that we hate to close the book and return, reluctantly, to the ho-hum present.  It's a glowing, vivid work of art.<br /><br />Judy Lindttle more than subhuman?

The poems in &quot;Selected Poems&quot; represent some of the best of his collections, &quot;Romancero Gitano&quot;, &quot;Libro de Poemas&quot;, and the dark, brooding &quot;Poema del Cante Jondo&quot;.  Stephen Spender's excellent translation manages to preserve Garc&iacute;a Lorca's exquisite imagery without making it sound maudlin or overstated.  Garc&iacute;a Lorca really has to be read in the original Spanish to be able to get a complete realization of his incredible talent as a poet, but those monolingual English speakers to whom the book is directed will be able to appreciate through this translation what a genius was lost to the world when at the age of 38 he was assassinated in the Spanish Civil War.  Garc&iacute;a Lorca astonishes and amazes us with his brilliant artistry, his deceptively simple yet complex imagery, and the voice of haunting pathos that is surely the voice of Spain.  Even readers who don't particularly like poetry will be held spellbound by the poems presented here.	2002-05-11

After a few hours he returned it to me saying \\"Wow... this book doesn't have any answers, but it sure does make you think.\\"<br />Which is the whole purpose of Stock's book, and on that score it is a resounding success.  This book is not, and was never meant to be, an ice-breaker; the questions it poses are not for people you hardly know.  And some people do not like to be made to think; hence the negative reaction on the part of some readers to this book.  But if you like to explore issues from a side you've never seen before, or to learn more about yourself, this book will open your mind up.  It will challenge your ideas, your attitudes, your beliefs, your morals, and every certainty you thought you ever had.<br />Stock doesn't have the answers and doesn't pretend to; he wants readers to explore the issues and find the answers for themselves.  And some of his questions lead to more questions; for instance: Would you be willing to murder an innocent person if it would end hunger in the world? leading to the general question of what do you think of people who achieve great things by compromising their principles?  Or try this one: If God appeared to you and told you to leave everything behind, would you do it?  What if you were told -- like Abraham -- to sacrifice your child?<br />The reader learns while going through this book that there are no right or wrong answers; that questions often lead to more questions, and that the book reflects the uncertainties of life we all have to deal with.  It will challenge you, frustrate you, and ultimately help to enlighten you about yourself and who you are.  Reading it is an eye-opening and a mind-blowing experience.	2002-05-03

The psychology of conflict, knowing your adversary, knowing how to exploit his weaknesses for your advantage, and knowing how to win without wasting your own resources (to win without fighting) and accomplish the most by doing the least, is applicable to all human conflict situations, from the interpersonal to the international.  Sun Tzu places equal emphasis on knowing one's self, and one's strengths and limitations.  &quot;The Art of War&quot; is an excellent book about competition and conflict, and the strategies for successful management.	2002-05-03

The AIDS panic seems unbelievable in retrospect but was all too real in the 80s; people were forced off their jobs, children were barred from schools, and anyone who belonged to the \\"4-H club\\" (homosexuals, hard-drug users, hemophiliacs, and -- incredibly -- Haitians) were treated like pariahs.  The secrecy and denial in dealing with the crisis helped it to spread unabated.<br /><br />Shilts pulls no punches in writing this book.  He is equally angry at the Reagan administration which preached pious platitudes while withholding desperately needed funds for medical research; the radical gay community which refused to acknowledge its own responsibility for the sexually promiscuous behavior that helped spread the disease like wildfire, and those in the medical community who played grandstanding politics and plain old-fashioned spite while patients were dying all around them.  And then of course there was the media, which treated this puzzling, terrifying new disease -- which for two years after its discovery didn't even have a name -- as something the \\"general public\\" didn't have to be concerned about, until heterosexual men and women began to be infected.<br /><br />But there were also the heroes -- the physicians who devoted their days and nights to treating their patients, gay men like Larry Kramer who refused to let the gay community sweep the problem under the rug, Rock Hudson, whose up-front candor and admission of his illness shocked the American public and helped to bring AIDS out of the closet once and for all, and C. Everett Koop, Reagan's Surgeon General, who refused to play politics and demonstrated the leadership his boss lacked in his common-sense and compassionate approach to meeting the crisis, to the horror of his right-wing constituency.<br /><br />Shilts wrote his story with such compelling urgency that it wraps the reader up like a whodunit you don't want to put down.  One shares his disgust at the doctors who cared more about their own self-promotion than about their patients; the right-wing politicians who treated the victims of a devastating and deadly disease as if they were sinners who had earned the wrath of God; the gay men who didn't care how many people they infected as long as they could enjoy the promiscuous atmosphere of the bath houses, and most incredibly, the for-profit blood banks, which refused to admit their product was carrying a deadly virus and fought against blood testing for three years while the number of people who died from transfusions of infected blood grew by the thousands.  And in a heartbreaking coda to this story, Shilts deliberately put off having his own blood tested while he was writing this book because he didn't want his judgement biased if he turned out to be HIV positive.  It was only after he finished the book that he learned that he was infected with the virus that had killed so many and in a few years would also kill him.<br /><br />Shilts' death from AIDS was a tragedy, but he left us this magnificent book as his legacy.

It's sharp, incisive, and provides food for thought.  Cohen's book is an expansion on his column, and in a fun twist, he provides an opportunity for his readers to get into the act.  One of the strongest points of Cohen's column, and his book, is that he doesn't render his opinion and slam the door shut; he opens the door for further discussion and argument.  Cohen admits he doesn't have all the answers, and he includes some comments from writers who have diverged from his opinions.  Basically, Cohen's take on ethics is situational; he doesn't hand down ironclad edicts.  Most of the questions he receives from readers fall into the \\"Do I tell or not\\" category; e.g., do I tell my neighbor I saw her husband with the sexy blonde in the bar.  Cohen's advice is to consider your role in the situation; if you are merely a snoopy neighbor then MYOB; but if you are a cop who has busted hubby in a house of ill repute where he stands a high risk of catching HIV and passing it on to his wife, then the wife has a right to know what risks she has been inadvertently exposed to (and let hubby duck before the boom lowers on him).  Cohen isn't out to preach or moralize; his goal is to make his readers think, and in this he succeeds admirably.  The book is both fun and a learning experience for anyone who reads it.	2002-04-29

He hasn't written a novel that really grabs you since \\"Needful Things\\", and his recent short stories for the most part show the same lack of the old spark.  I wasn't crazy about \\"Riding the Bullet\\" when it came out as an e-book (maybe it was the format that turned me off; how do you curl up with an e-book?), and his serial novel \\"The Plant\\" was showing some real promise when he infuriatingly suspended it halfway through, leaving his readers hanging.  \\"Everything Eventual\\" is pretty much a compilation of so-so short stories that one feels wouldn't have made the cut in \\"Nightmares and Dreamscapes\\".  But there are a few real gems among all the ho-hums that make me give this book four stars.  \\"Everything's Eventual\\", the book's title story, is a spooky tale of a dream job that turns into a ghastly nightmare; \\"Lunch at the Gotham Cafe\\" is a deliciously grisly shocker, and few readers will be albe to resist the screaming horror inside \\"1408\\".  \\"The Little Sisters of Eluria\\", a prequel to Kings 7-volume epic \\"The Dark Tower\\", rekindled my interest in the series which stopped at volume 4 a few years back (although King assures it that volume 5, all 900 pages of it, is on the near horizon).  I'm hoping that King will tie up his loose ends, namely, finish the \\"Tower\\" epic and give us the second half of \\"The Plant\\", and then leave us to appreciate him, if not at the top of his game, at least with the memory of how great a writer he can be when he is at his very best.	2002-04-19

He uses the concept of Flatlanders to help us understand what our world would look like to one who is only able to perceive in two dimensions (and by extension, helping us to understand why our three-dimensional brains have so much trouble conceiving of four or more dimensions), and he gives a truly hilarious sketch of how wormholes in space may be formed by imagining what would happen if you heated an ice cube on your kitchen stove to 10 to the 32nd power K (at this point, Mr. Kaku advises, it may be advisable to leave the kitchen).

Shirer was an American journalist in Germany during the 1930's; he watched Hitler's rise from obscurity in Austria to become the most powerful and evil force in Europe.  Shirer was witness to what Hitler built and nourished and he doesn't pretend to be impartial.  He states in the book's introduction that he hates all totalitarian governments and he especially came to loathe this one as he watched its relentless assault and violation of everything that makes people human.  Shirer pays Hitler grudging respect as a man of undoubted, if evil, genius.  He knew how to manipulate time and circumstances to his advantage.  But he couldn't have done it alone or in a vacuum, and Shirer builds a solid background on the historical events that made Hitler and Nazism possible.  Antisemitism was an old story in Germany; there is an almost unbroken string from Hitler back to Martin Luther whose advice to kill and destroy all Jews as enemies of mankind was \\"literally followed 500 years later by Hitler, Goering and Himmler\\".  He writes of how the great majority of Germans enthusiastically and blindly followed Hitler through conquest, war, and the destruction and devastation of their country.  And he shows in convincing and sickening detail the German mindset that made them \\"ubermensch\\" in their own minds, and everyone else, especially Jews and Slavic peoples, subhumans to be killed or allowed to live as slaves to German \\"kultur\\".<br />Shirer's book is abundantly documented, largely thanks to the bonanza of Nazi documents that fell almost untouched into Allied hands at the end of the war.  Perhaps it was that mania for organization and precision that contributed to the \\"Final Solution\\": first, the determination that the Jews were to be eliminated and then the search for a method to most efficiently bring this about.  So from mass shootings in the trenches, they progressed to Auschwitz and the gas chambers, and kept searching for ways to improve the rate and efficiency of the carnage right up to the end.<br />What kind of people would participate in something as monstrous as this?  Some of the most chilling passages in the book are the descriptions of the defendants' testimony at the Nuremberg trials, as when one officer says without batting an eye that he personally oversaw the deaths of 90,000 people.  Even this pales before the descriptions of the medical experiments in the concentration camps, when respected doctors prostituted their science and their souls in some of the most despicable tortures ever perpetrated on human beings, and lost their own humanity in the process.<br />One of the main strengths of the book, besides the wealth of documentation, is that it was written only 14 years after the end of the war, when many of the main characters were still alive.  Shirer gives grudging respect to those Germans such as Halder and Speer who were able to face up to and acknowledge their own guilt and complicity that allowed the unspeakable to become real.  One wonders what Heydrich or Von Ribbentrop would have told him had they not been executed, one by Czech partisans and the other by a hangman's noose after the Nuremberg trials.<br />Shirer narrates in detail the failed plot to kill Hitler by his own officers in 1944, the revenge exacted by Hitler and his kangaroo courts, the Allied invasion of Western Europe and the final assault by Russia and the Allied forces that destroyed Nazi Germany, and not a minute too soon.  He feels some sympathy for the German people who followed Hitler blindly to their own destruction, like lemmings over a cliff.  It is difficult to share his feelings.

In \\"Jurassic Park\\", one of Crichton's better novels, there is a basic formula: Dinosaurs + Murphy's Law = Trouble.  Our hero, Alan Grant, a paleontologist with a healthy respect for dinosaurs, and his assistant Ellie Sattler, a paleobotanist, have dug up some interesting dinosaur fossils in the Montana badlands.  Into their camp comes an invitation from a millionaire entrepreneur named John Hammond with a proposal much more interesting: a visit to his unfinished theme park on an island off the coast of Costa Rica.  Off they go in Hammond's private plane, with a lawyer named Donald Gennaro and a slightly wacko mathematician named Ian Malcolm who specializes in chaos theory.  What they find on the island blows their minds into the stratosphere: Hammond's scientists have successfully managed to clone and breed living dinosaurs.  Wowie-kazowie, what a terrific idea for a theme park!  Or so say Hammond and Gennaro, thinking of the astronomical bottom line, but Grant, Sattler, and especially Malcolm, have their doubts: living creatures are unpredictable, you can't know what they will do or how they will react, and if something starts to go wrong in a small way, the subsequent chain of events will guarantee a screw-up in a big way.  Chaos theory rules after all.  ... And when the raptors prove to be almost as smart, and much stronger and faster, than humans, Murphy's Law starts to take over with a vengeance.  ...There's a lesson to be learned in all of this and Crichton grabs us and propels us along in a dizzying ride through almost 400 pages, but the moral is clear: Just because you can try to play God, doesn't necessarily mean it's a great idea.  Nature had a reason to make the dinosaurs extinct, and Mother Nature doesn't appreciate mere mortals messing in her business.  Crichton's characters suffer from his usual lack of development, they're two-dimensional and never really leap off the page, which is the only thing that keeps me from giving this book five stars; because the story, and the dinosaurs, are so fascinating that Crichton could have written another 400 pages and held me mesmerized to the end.  Whatever Crichton's deficiencies as a writer, he is one helluva story teller.they're two-dimensional and never really leap off the page, which is the only thing that keeps me from giving this book five stars; because the story, and the dinosaurs, are so fascinating that Crichton could have written another 400 pages and held me mesmerized to the end.

We watch the main characters progress (or decline) as the series unfolds, and while the changes and deterioration can be painful to watch, they are also eminently believable.  We shake our heads at Mary Ann's metamorphosis from a corn-fed innocent from Cleveland looking for success and Mr. Right into a career-driven egomaniac who will sacrifice anything and everything that stands in her way, and we cheer Michael on from one adventure to the next in his frantic search for his own Mr. Right, knowing that his final happiness will have a time limit caused by his past bed-hopping which will result in a slow death sentence; we just want him and his lover to make the most of the time left to them.  Watching the antics of the younger set is Anna Madrigal, the benevolent landlady of 28 Barbary Lane, a self-made individual in every sense of the word, everybody's favorite \\"aunt\\" figure, accepting, non-judgemental, knowing how to keep her distance, but always there when you need her.  We wish Armistead Maupin had written a seventh book to bring us yet another installment in his characters' lives, but maybe it's best that he left off where he did, and let us use our imaginations from that point on.  It's a great series and great fun by a very talented writer.	2002-04-03

It's a verbal contest in which two opponents hurl all kinds of insults at each other, the object being to see which one can beat down the other without either of them losing their cool or resorting to physical violence.  It does not mean cursing the opponent out; in fact, the most effective snaps, or insults, involve no profanity at all.  Percelay, Dweck and Ivey have compiled hundreds of snaps from sources all over the black community and organized them into categories (fat snaps, skinny snaps, stupid snaps, ugly snaps, color snaps... well, you get the idea).  A few examples: \\"Your mother's so fat, she has her own area code\\" or \\"Your mother's so fat, when I got on top of her my ears popped\\" (which is, in effect, a double snap -- she's not only obese, she's a lady of ill repute); or \\"Your father's so dumb, he leaves his fly open in case he has to count to eleven\\", or \\"You were so ugly when you were born, the doctor slapped your mother instead of you.\\"  \\"Snaps\\" is hilarious and will have you laughing out loud, as well as appreciating the razor-sharp wit of whoever dreamed some of these gems up.  Check it out, as well as its companion book, \\"Double Snaps\\" -- double the pleasure and double the fun.	2002-04-02

Robert Van Gulik evidently had a lot of fun translating &quot;Celebrated Cases of Judge Dee&quot;; when he couldn't find any more Judge Dee mysteries, he decided to write his own.  &quot;The Haunted Monastery&quot; takes place during one night (appropriately dark and stormy) in a Buddhist monastery where several young girls have disappeared without a trace; among the characters are a Taoist sage, a dissolute abbot, a performing bear, and a female impersonator, all set against a backdrop of dark winding corridors, secret rooms and a version of the Taoist Hell.  By morning the storm outside has abated, and the mystery inside has been solved.  &quot;The Chinese Maze Murders&quot; involves an overgrown, impenetrable (literally and figuratively) garden maze, a painting with a secret clue that will give the key to how to reach the maze's center; two young sisters, and a particularly vile murderer who specializes in torturing and killing young ladies.  Of the two, I thought &quot;Monastery&quot; was more fun, but both books are excellent examples of the Chinese mystery genre and Van Gulik succeeds in capturing the essence of the original Judge Dee.  Of all Van Gulik's Judge Dee novels, &quot;Monastery&quot; and &quot;Maze&quot; come closest to the unknown Chinese author and are therefore, for this reviewer, his two best original books.	2002-04-02

Two rival teams are racing to be first on the site, where lies a fabulous treasure of boron diamonds that are going to change the world as we know it.  One team is made up of a greedy conglomerate (Germans and Japanese, wouldn't you know); the other is headed by a brilliant but cold-blooded young scientist named Karen Ross who is accompanied by an eccentric adventurer, a primatologist named Peter Elliot, and Peter's laboratory subject, a mountain gorilla named Amy.  Amy has been the cause of concern among animal rights activists who feel she is being mistreated (actually, many humans don't have it as good as Amy), so Peter wants to get her out of the country and back to her natural habitat.  The race to get to the diamonds first involves encounters with rampaging hippos, a murderous tribe of cannibals, and sneaky doings by the rival team who briefly drug and kidnap Amy.  But what they find once they reach the site is not only diamonds, but something so unimagined and terrifying that it doesn't even have a name.  Suffice to say, it's able to create all kinds of mayhem before the book reaches its climax.<br />Like all his other books, \\"Congo\\" suffers from one-dimensional characters, and Crichton has an infuriating habit of referring to females in their twenties as \\"girls\\" (would he call a 24 year old male a \\"boy\\"?).  But in Amy, Crichton has come up with a winner.  Amy is more of a personality than any human in the book.  She's bright (she has a vocabulary of 600 signs and can say whatever she wants to), she's funny, she's very much a lady (she loves lipstick and she's choosy about the colors of the sweaters she wears); she has a temperamental side (she sulks and pouts when things don't go her way), she loves Peter and she's insanely jealous of his lady friends.  The action and adventure zip right along, but Amy is what makes this book such a fun read.she loves Peter and she's insanely jealous of his lady friends.

Not wanting to arouse the ire of the folks next door (and also unwilling to risk a late-night visit by New York's Finest for disturbing the peace), I took the book to the office to read on my lunch hour.  BAAAAAAAAAAAD mistake... the THUD my co-workers heard was me hitting the floor.  From every corner of the office they converged, to find me helpless with laughter, tears running down my face, absolutely wasted for the rest of the afternoon.  Anyway... Michael Moore has written a belly-laugh-a-page howler about the current state of affairs in our nation's capital.  He has several bones to pick with our current president (&quot;the Thief in Chief&quot;) and also with Katherine Harris whose shenanigans helped him into the White House (can you believe an African-American voter and community activist with an impeccable civic record was told she had to be fingerprinted before she could enter the voting booth to prove she wasn't a felon?!!?), not to mention the Supreme Court (&quot;Bring me the head of Antonin Scalia!&quot; Moore bellows).  And all this is just in the first few chapters of the book.  Moore has no problem at all in poking holes in every self-important nitwit and poobah in Washington and letting out a lot of malodorous hot air.  He's saying a lot that needs saying and nobody, whatever their political leaning, from true blue to flaming red, is safe from his wrath if he thinks they deserve it.

There is a noxious type of denizen who resides on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, that produces a child for reasons know only to God and themselves, and then spend the next 20 years seeing as little of that child as possible.  This type is hilariously and devastatingly portrayed in \\"The Nanny Diaries\\" in the persona of Mrs. X, a thirty-something wife of a millionaire mergers and acquistions businessman living in a tony apartment on Park Avenue that has all the charm of a mausoleum.  Mr. and Mrs. X have a four year old son named Grayer whom they spend enormous amounts of time and energy avoiding.  They schedule Grayer for French lessons, play dates, ayurvedic therapy, buy him the most expensive toys, feed him only wholesome food (no Mickey D's for this kid), and dress him in the most expensive clothes, but as far as actually raising, loving and caring for him -- what are you, kidding?  They have nannies for that.  Which is where Nan comes in, a 21 year old NYU student on the brink of graduation, who becomes the central figure in Grayer's life, mainly by his parents' default.  Grayer has to wash his hands before he can touch Mrs. X's mink coat.  Mrs. X is so stressed out from Christmas shopping that she requires a full day at the Bliss spa to de-stress.  Actually, she is so in need of private space for herself that she buys a studio apartment for her own personal use so that she doen't have to be actually stuck in the same space with her own child, but is near enough to be \\"involved\\" with him.  When Mr. X is not pulling down billion-dollar deals at the office, he is cheating on his wife in her own bed, so of course he has no time for his son either.  Mrs. X is so self-centered she treats Nanny as an extension of herself to be there at her beck and call.  She actually expects Nanny to forego her graduation from NYU to accompany the family to Nantucket, and when Nanny insists on delaying her departure by a day so that she can attend her graduation, Mrs. X starts shopping around for Nanny's replacement.  Mrs. X thinks that the world revolves around her and her needs.  She's brought up short, however, by the realization that, just as her husband dumped his first wife for her, she is about to get dumped for another woman.  There's a remedy for that, though.  Mrs. X decides to make Mr. X stay put by giving Grayer a baby brother or sister.  Imagine this woman producing another child to foist off on another succession of nannies.  There oughta be a law.<br />Kraus and McLaughlin actually worked as nannies and, supposedly, have seen it all.  Mrs. X is said to be a composite of some of the women they have worked for.  It's hard to believe people like this actually exist, but the Xes, however obnoxious the appear, are eminently believable.  These are people for whom a child is a trophy, who spend thousands of dollars on \\"problem consultants\\" and \\"image consultants\\" grooming their tykes to survive the cutthroat competition for admission into New York's prestigious private schools (thinking that this will guarantee their child's admission to the Ivies twelve years down the line), who are advised by the \\"experts\\" they consult to prep their child for the admission interview by reading him articles from the \\"Wall Street Journal\\".  Do you think these people could ever be bothered to read the kid \\"Goodnight Moon\\" even once?  Fuhgeddaboudit. (That's Nanny's job.)<br />The Xes themselves are admirably drawn; despite their outrageous behavior, they're people rather than caricatures.  Mrs. X may be a monster of selfishness, but we have to pity her; we know what's in store for her, a growing desperation as Mr. X bounces from one affair to another, certain to be traded in like a used BMW for a younger and prettier model, probably ending up a nervous wreck with nothing to fill her empty life.  Grayer is the poor little rich kid; we hurt for him as we realize how little he means to his parents and how little they will ultimately mean to him.  And Nannyherself wins our respect as she tries to hold onto her sanity in this beautifully appointed nuthouse, while trying to give Grayer the love and affection he should be getting from his parents.  \\"The Nanny Diaries\\" is not only great fun, but as social satire it's bang-on.  One of the better books I've read in quite a while.herself wins our respect as she tries to hold onto her sanity in this beautifully appointed nuthouse, while trying to give Grayer the love and affection he should be getting from his parents.  \\"The Nanny Diaries\\" is not only great fun, but as social satire it's bang-on.

Recovering from his most recent run-in with the Baron, from which Picard emerges decidedly the worse for wear, he attends a party given by a wealthy and mysterious immigrant named Ric Lazare, of dubious origins, and his fabulously beautiful wife, Renee Lazare.  The party is attended by all of upper-class Paris and the draw is a fortune-telling machine which holds all the guests mesmerized.  Invited into a private room which holds the famous machine, Picard finds himself hurled headlong into a web of gypsy magic, murder, seduction and mystery that leads him through Germany to Austria, the Hungarian steppes, and back to Paris, to confront his fate before the fortune telling machine.  His fortune, Fata Morgana, is, like Ric and Renee Lazare, a shimmering mirage, irresistable, unknowable, and ultimately unreachable; one can only accept it as it is.  Kotzwinkle has woven a magical story that holds us entranced to the very last page.	2002-03-17

Everett is clearly fed up with the current plague of \\"blaxploitation\\" novels, badly written by writers with no art and even less craft, whose only purpose is to jump on the \\"ghetto fab\\" bandwagon and make a quick buck.  His protagonist, Thelonious Ellison (with the name Thelonius, what else could he be called but Monk?), writes literature deemed too obscure (read: too \\"white\\") for a black audience and finds his work relegated to dusty corners in the back of the bookstores.  Fueling his outrage is a piece of trash literature called \\"We Lives In Da Ghetto\\", hailed as an \\"authentic\\" voice of the \\"black experience\\" by reviewers who lump all blacks as ghetto blacks, which rakes in $3 million.  What's a struggling author with bills to pay and a terminally ailing mother to do?  If you can't beat 'em, join 'em... better yet, out-do 'em.  In no time at all, Monk has banged out the blaxploitation novel to end all blaxploitation novels, a mishmash called \\"My Pafology\\" (later renamed a four-letter word I can't print here), under the pseudonym Stagg R. Lee, which not only wins the National Book Award, but also has Hollywood beating his door down for the movie rights.  Everett is clearly disgusted both at those whites whose contempt of blacks runs so deep that they take trash \\"blaxploitation\\" novels at face value and consider them as representative of \\"the black experience\\" (as if there is one single \\"black experience\\"), and at those blacks whose lack of self-respect is so deep that they buy into the hype.  As a black reader, I share his feelings totally.  Everett at times takes himself too seriously and this is the only thing that kept me from giving this book five stars; but he's an enormously talented and promising writer who has the gift of making you think even while he has you laughing out loud.  I'm looking forward to his next book.book.	2002-02-27

Lavishly illustrated and gloriously photographed, &quot;The Blue Planet&quot; is a fascinating exploration of the 70% of our world that we don't live in.  As one of the authors states, we know more about the surface of the moon than we do about our own oceans.  &quot;Blue Planet&quot; tries to address the imbalance and, for the lay reader, succeeds admirably.  The book is excellently organized and written in plain language comprehensible to almost any reader.  It's divided into seven main parts: an overview of the ocean system, coastal shorelines, tropical seas, temperate seas, frozen seas, the open ocean, and the deep. Each part is divided into subsections with reference arrows to other relevant sections, making it easy to use for research.  We learn a lot about the feeding, mating and survival patterns of the inhabitants of each layer of the ocean; most fascinating to this reviewer was the dazzling spectacle of the light shows caused by bioluminescence in fish that live so deep down that most of us will only see them on film.  There's also a photograph of a dead giant squid, proving that archyteuthis is no figment of anyone's imagination; we wonder if anyone will ever glimpse a live one.  The book is a companion volume to the excellent series on the Discovery Channel but it stands up very well on its own.  It's a must-have for anyone interested in the infinite variety of life on this world.	2002-02-04

I wonder, does one ever outgrow this book?  Almost 50 years later I still have it, read to shreds, patched and repatched with scotch tape, a book to be treasured forever and never thrown away.  Elizabeth Enright told the story of a family of four children with such freshness and originality that she still received letters years afterwards from young readers wondering if the Melendys were &quot;real&quot;.  Enright set her story during the second World War and the three books comprising this volume span a time period of less than two years, from early 1942 to late 1943; but they are chock full of enough fun and adventure to satisfy any youngster -- or oldster -- fortunate enough to get hold of it.  Holt publishers should do the world a favor and reprint this book as soon as possible.  It's a gem for every child and every generation.  I still marvel at the priceless find I picked up off a bookshelf at random 50 years ago for only 25 cents.  It's paid me back a zillion-fold ever since.	2002-02-04

The Chinese detective story is different from what we are used to in that we know right off the bat whodunit; the fun is in watching the criminal be tracked down and caught.  The three crimes in this novel, none of which are connected to each other, include a hardened criminal who robs and kills two merchants; an adulterous woman who murders her husband to live with her young lover, and a young student suspected of killing his bride on their wedding night.  Aided by four trusty henchmen -- two reformed highwaymen, an old family servant, and an erstwhile con-man, Judge Dee unravels the tangled clues until he brings all the perpetrators to justice.  Van Gulik shows us, in his excellent translation, that the ancient Chinese justice system, although harsh, was fair to all, and that no one was exempt from deserved punishment whatever their age, rank or gender.  This book is a lot of fun for anyone who is interested in things Chinese, or who just enjoys a good, well-written detective story.	2002-01-27

The drawings in the book represent some of the best of his work, which spans six decades; and although the caricatures are named at the foot of the pages, the reader will have a lot of fun not only recognizing who the people are without the help of the captions, but also in searching for and finding the Ninas.<br /><br />Judy Lind	2002-01-25

Steele raises some valid points; namely, that blacks cannot continue to blame whites for all the ills of the black community, that whites are not causing the high rates of black-on-black crime, drug abuse and out-of-wedlock births in the inner cities or the peer pressure that leads many black youngsters to reject education or be branded as nerds; and that the perpetuation of these problems may in part be explained by \\"we have met the enemy and they is us\\".  None of these problems is going to be resolved until people start taking responsibility for their own actions.  But Steele seriously undermines his own credibility when he insists that racism is no longer a problem for blacks in America, and when he tries to push this further by denying that racism is still a significant presence in America, this reader starts to wonder what planet is Steele living on.  It's all well and good for Steele to say that the past is past and let's live for tomorrow; but blacks in America can never forget the past, we have been shaped by our past and our struggles to rise above the degradation that was forced on us from the moment we were dragged onto the slave ships.  Steele would have done better to acknowledge that racism is still a potent force in America, and that we will find our strength by acknowledging it, facing up to it, and in the words of our old folks, \\"keep on keepin' on\\".  What Steele needs to emphasize is that blacks in America have been incredibly strong just to survive in this country, and it is that very strength that will help us to endure and ultimately prevail.	2002-01-23

Palomino Molero, eighteen years old, a guitar player who enchanted everyone for miles around singing boleros, is found brutally tortured and murdered near a local air force base.<br /><br />Two civil guards, Officer Lituma and Lieutenant Silva, try to unravel the crime.  Rumors abound all over the place; the victim was involved in smuggling or the like and the higher-ups are covering up the perpetrators.  But when Silva and Lituma find out that what Palomino Molero was involved in was not smuggling but a love affair with the daughter of his base commander, the plot thickens in all kinds of ways.<br /><br />Vargas Llosa's book is not only a crime novel but a bitter indictment of the social/racial conflicts of modern Peru, where an airman cannot fall in love with the daughter of a colonel, especially if she is white and he is a cholo (half-breed).  Vargas Llosa knows how to leaven his story with comic relief; Lieutenant Silva is hopelessly in love with and shamelessly pursuing the respectably married Dona Adriana, and her revenge on him for his presumption is a riot.  The murder is solved, but the townspeople won't accept the truth, and insist that they were right all along; there were \\"higher-ups\\" involved.  \\"Higher-ups\\" indeed.<br /><br />It would be a crime in itself to give the solution away and I'm not going to; suffice to say that Vargas Llosa has written a gem of a murder mystery with an ingenious plot twist.  It's a very short novel and shows again that some of the best things come in small packages.<br /><br />Judy Lind	2002-01-18

It is a story about the hautest of the haute New York society in the latter half of the 1980's, a time when the rich rushed off in limousines to the most exclusive parties every night, oblivious to and unconcerned about the homeless who camped out in cardboard boxes on the sidewalks outside their luxury condos.  It brings us the creme de la creme of the old line WASPs in the Social Register who take themselves terribly seriously, much more so than anyone else does.  They are a dying breed and it's probably just as well.<br /><br />At the very top of the pile, breathing the rarified air of the upper strata of New York society, sits the Altemus/VanDegan family, led by Lil Altemus and her brother Laurance VanDegan, quintessential snobs, sure of their self-worth, loathing the \\"new money\\" that is invading their sacrosanct circle of friends and acquaintances.  Lil's son, Hubie, is a disappointment to his family; he's gay, kicked out of Harvard for cheating on a Spanish exam (\\"the language of maids\\" huffs his uncle Laurance), and hopelessly in love with his Puerto Rican hustler boyfriend Juanito; and her daughter Justine marries a TV anchorman, Bernard Slatkin, whose name will most definitely not be found in the Social Register.  Charging headlong into this formerly impenetrable social ring is Elias Renthal, who has made billions of dollars on Wall Street through hostile takeovers and financial wizardry, and his beautiful, ambitious wife Ruby.<br /><br />Observing from the sidelines and taking notes is Gus Bailey, the ever-present \\"spare man\\", available to squire single ladies to dinners, balls, etc.  Gus had his own agenda, however, and when he finally swings from observation into action, he makes some very large waves.  His mission accomplished, Gus looks around him at the shallowness and narrow-mindedness of the society he moved so effortlessly into, and comes to the conclusion that the reader probably arrived at before the end of the second chapter; namely, that \\"this ain't it\\".<br /><br />Dominic Dunne knows the kind of people he writes about and he is an acute and astute observer.  We see Lil Altemus in all her vanity, her shallowness, her conceit and we realize, finally, how pathetic she is; Justine wins our respect by her determination not to be a \\"lady who lunches\\" like her mother and her mother's friends; and poor Hubie is a genuinely tragic figure, fitting neither into the world he was born into or his lover's world he tries to fit into.  The most interesting figure in this book, however, is Ruby Renthal; pushy to an extreme but extremely likeable nonetheless, and possessing an integrity which places her far above the socialites who look down on her as a new-money, no-class upstart.<br /><br />\\"People Like Us\\" by no means falls into the category of serious literature and it doesn't try to; but it's an enjoyable read and shines a harsh light into a closed society which doesn't look all that appetizing once its seamier side is exposed.

At the center of the book is Maria Wyeth, who at 31 is on the far side of the big 3-0 dividing line; orphaned when her parents are killed in a car crash, divorced from her film-director husband, the mother of a handicapped, institutionalized child, a sometime model and actress, who has become desensitized and remote from the pain of others to hide her own interior pain.<br /><br />Maria has truly been \\"out there where nothing is\\" but instead of rejecting it, she has come to feel at home in it.  The final nail in the coffin of her ability to feel is the abortion her estranged husband forces her to have to get rid of the child of her married lover; if she refuses, he will take custody of their own daughter.  From that point, her life spirals downward into a haze of drugs, booze and casual, meaningless sex; communication with others is reduced to an interchange of one-liners; we wonder if this woman can feel anything for anyone any more.  When Maria is able to calmly watch the husband of her supposed best friend destroy himself without lifting a finger to try to help him, we wonder is it because she is too lazy to call for help, or too detached to care.<br /><br />Joan Didion's prose is as spare and as stark as the inner life of the character she writes about, and in simple but telling phrases she is able to convey to the reader all the pain and emptiness, and finally the viciousness, that passes for Maria's life.  Maria will wallow in her own anomie and to hell with anyone who gets burned by contact with her.  Is this payback?  Maybe.  Joan Didion lets us see Maria and her life in all its revolting nothingness, and makes us want to thank God it isn't ours.<br /><br />Judy Lind	2002-01-17

Interspersed with Urania's history is the narrative of the plot that resulted in Trujillo's assassination in May of 1961 and its subsequent denouement.  The account of the arrest and torture of the assassins is not for the squeamish; Vargas Llosa presents it in sickening detail.<br /><br />Along with the story line of Urania's flight to the United States and her subsequent self-imposed exile, and the killing of Trujillo which liberated the Dominican Republic from one of the most odious dictators on the planet, Vargas Llosa provides us with a stark portrait of Trujillo himself: diabolically clever, devious, cruel, unable to deal with advancing old age that no more spares him than anyone else; pathetically trying to prove his masculinity by raping virgins; repelled by the Haitian blood that darkened his skin and attempting to purge his self-loathing in the cold-blooded massacre of thousands of Haitian settlers.  A fascinating and repulsive offshoot of Trujillo is his son Ramfis, named by his father as a general of the Dominican army at the age of seven, fit for nothing but dissipation, and so stuck on himself that he feels he is bestowing an honor on young girls by raping and humiliating them.  One of the most enigmatic and intriguing, albeit loathesome, characters of the book is the self-serving, double-dealing figurehead president Joaquin Balaguer, playing both ends against the middle while he cravenly submits to the dictatorship's cruelty and tyranny.<br /><br />\\"The Feast of the Goat\\" is not a great book; it's confusing at times, rambles at intervals; but it provides a powerful look at one of the most revolting figures of the 20th century and the repressive society he built almost single-handedly, and makes us feel what it must have been like to live in such a country.

In clear, concise language, John Reader gives us the historical and geographical background of each area, the current economic and social structure, and the problems affecting the particular region.  The photographs are mind-blowing; they are so gorgeous that they almost dominate the excellent text.  The one disappointment, for one who has also seen the PBS series, is that the book doesn't follow the individual stories of people in depth as the PBS production did; however, no one who hasn't seen the TV production will miss it, and it in no way detracts from the overall value of the book.  This is one book about the &quot;dark continent&quot; that does the continent, and its people, proud.	2001-12-16

The mammals were hit hard but rebounded with a vengeance, and by the time this book opens, after the dust had died down and the planet was again habitable, they had become the dominant life form on earth.  The book takes us through several geological periods, introducing us to various species which became dominant and then extinct in their turn, up through the last great ice age in which some extinct life forms, notably the woolly mammoth and the woolly rhinoceros, interacted with a relative newcomer on the planet named homo sapiens.  Haines also shows how homo sapiens descended from australopithecus, the first recognizable humanid, and how many of the social traits of the first humans were handed down through the generations to the present time.  Somehow, prehistoric mammals have never generated the same kind of awe that dinosaurs have, maybe because they remind us of animals we are already familiar with, but they provide a fascinating glimpse of how life evolved down through the millenia, and just because many of them looked vaguely like animals currently on our planet, and some of them were actually contemporaneous with human beings, we can imagine what life might have been like had they hung around for a few more epochs.  Imagine seeing a giant Indricothere (who looked something like a cross between an overweight giraffe and an elephant) ambling down your street; or witnessing a run-in between a sabre-tooth cat and a giant sloth (sloth wins every time), or chasing a stray mammoth out of your yard.  At the end of the book we realize that Haines' greatest achievement is in showing us that extinction has been the fate of most of the species on earth since life first began; and that we are, after all, just another species of mammal, and therefore subject to -- perhaps destined to -- extinction in our own turn.all, just another species of mammal, and therefore subject to -- perhaps destined to -- extinction in our own turn.	2001-12-13

Since most of us are more comfortable with modern English, a good translation makes all the difference, and Nevill Coghill's excellent translation does full version to Chaucer's book.  Reading this version takes the work out of it and makes \\"The Canterbury Tales\\" a pure pleasure.<br /><br />Chaucer writes about everyman and his stories represent one of the motliest crews in English literature: the Wife of Bath who has put away five husbands and is looking for a sixth; the pardoner, the reeve, the clerk, the knight, and a host of others from all walks of life.  There is something in here for everyone; my three favorite stories are the Pardoner's Tale; the Miller's Tale (reading this in Coghill's translation, I could see why it has been excised from the bowdlerized versions used in high school English classes; it's rude, crude and downright lewd, but it's so hysterical they had to sew my sides up again when I finally stopped laughing), and the Franklin's tale of the knight, the squire and the magician who outdo each other in chivalry.<br /><br />  Antisemitism was commonplace in medieval Europe and Chaucer is no more free of it than anyone else of his time; but to say that The Canterbury Tales is not worth reading because Chaucer was true to his time is overstatement.  One must accept that Chaucer was as human and imperfect as most of his peers; without compromising the fact that Chaucer was a literary genius who had a profound effect on English language and English literature.<br /><br />Judy Lind	2001-05-02

Herodotus clearly enjoys his subject and enjoys writing about it; he has been accused of fabricating facts but he states several times in the book that although he feels obligated to report everything he has heard, he does not have to believe it all alike, and where he doesn't believe what he has heard or read, he says so.  In contrast to Thucydides, whose style is didactic, analytic and dry as dust, Herodotus write with a lot of verve and humor, and makes us live in his time by bringing the time vividly to life.  The translation by Aubrey Selincourt is a good one, but if you can, get the edition translated by George Rawlinson (&quot;The Persian Wars&quot;), which is more interesting and more fun to read. This is a wonderful volume for history buffs or anyone who simply enjoys a well-written, fascinating book.	2001-04-30

It's been out of print for several years and I'm delighted it's been reissued.  It's concise, omits nothing of importance to the story, and it's a great read.  &quot;Red Chamber&quot; is the story of the Chia clan, a large and very rich Mandarin family, racing headlong into financial and moral ruin, which is redeemed by the youngest son of the house, the spoiled and effeminate Pao Yu.  Heading the family is the Princess Ancestress, one of the most arresting and interesting characters of any literature, able to stand up to and hold her own against anyone.  Other strong figures in the family are Pao Yu's father, Chia Cheng, a stern, upright, moralistic individual, unable to see past his own nose, and his aunt Phoenix, too shrewd and clever for her own good, whose intrigues and double-dealing bring the house crashing down.  The tale of ruin and redemption is an old one in Chinese literature, and &quot;Red Chamber&quot; relates it excellently, all the while giving us fascinating insights into Chinese life, culture and values.  For anyone interested in things Chinese, or anyone who just appreciates a great book, this book is a must-read.	2001-04-18

Because Ira Levin hit every right note in \\"Rosemary's Baby\\" and made it into an instantaneous horror classic.  On one level, it's a great horror story; on another, it's also a kind of morality play: God has a son; what happens when the devil gets jealous and wants one too?<br /><br />Enter Rosemary and Guy Woodhouse, almost-newlyweds, new tenants in an old, luxury building called \\"The Bramford\\", famous for its high ceilings and working fireplaces, notorious for its unsavory happenings (dead baby wrapped in newspapers abandoned in the basement).  They are warned off by Hutch, an old friend of Rosemary's who knows all about the building's sordid history, but disregard the omens.<br /><br />Rosemary is a housewife (yes, back in the day there actually were such things) who wants to be a mother.  Guy is an actor and a rising star whose talent is overshadowed only by his unlimited ambition.  Next door are the Castevets, Minnie and Roman, a delightfully ditzy old couple who just happen to head a coven of witches who have made a pact with the devil.  Rosemary wants a baby; Guy wants a leading part in a hit play; the witches want... well, all the ingredients are there for a devil's brew that sets the pot boiling wonderfully for 260 pages.<br /><br />After a nightmarish impregnation, Rosemary goes through a hellacious pregnancy, presided over by Dr. Sapirstein, a famous \\"society\\" obstetrician who assures Rosemary that her pains will go away in a day or two.  Hutch's death after a long, suspicious illness jolts Rosemary out of her cocoon of trusting ignorance, and here Levin builds the horror up ever so insidiously until it hits you like a sledgehammer.  Rosemary discovers who her neighbors are; that they have drawn her husband into a diabolical plot, and when she runs to Dr. Sapirstein for protection, she finds out that he too is... well, if you can't trust your husband and your obstetrician, who can you trust?  Rosemary is left alone to try to save her baby from what she fears is a plot against his life and safety, remembering that dead baby in the basement; there's a plot afoot, all right, but what it is, is something neither Rosemary or the reader could possibly imagine until they stare at it, literally and figuratively, in the eyes.<br /><br />Levin is one terrific storyteller and he manages to time the action to coincide perfectly with the story line; Rosemary conceives, ironically, on the night of the Pope's visit to New York in early October, and the baby is born, fittingly, right after midnight, \\"exactly half the year around from you-know\\".  Some readers have complained that the ending is lame after all the shock and horror, and they have a point, but it's fun to wonder, how else could Levin have ended this story?  It's a perfect psychological horror fantasy, no blood, no gore, no things that go bump in the night, but just the ordinary neighbors next door that can and do raise all kinds of hell.  It's a classic that has stood the test of time; after 35 years, it's still a great read.<br /><br />Judy Lindry is left alone to try to save her baby from what she fears is a plot against his life and safety, remembering that dead baby in the basement; there's a plot afoot, all right, but what it is, is something neither Rosemary or the reader could possibly imagine until they stare at it, literally and figuratively, in the eyes.

An English monk, Brother William of Baskerville, and his young assistant Adso of Melk, arrive at a monastery with the largest library in Christendom to investigate a series of puzzling assassinations that seem to have an uncanny coincidence with the plagues foretold in the Book of Revelations.<br /><br />A central argument of the book is the the all-encompassing love of Christ, as represented by William, versus the narrow-mindedness of medieval Catholicism as practiced by too many of the clergy, most egregiously in this story by Brother Bernard Gui, the diabolical Dominican inquisitor who seems more like an agent of the devil than a representative of Christ.  Another argument, and related to the first, is the ongoing battle between knowledge, as represented by science, again in the persona of William, and ignorance, as represented by narrow-minded religion in the persona of the blind Spanish monk Jorge of Burgos who is literally and figuratively blind to the light.<br /><br />Eco takes the reader right into the heart of the time and the place; he makes us feel what it is like to live in a 14th century monastery, and in an inspired touch he names the chapters in the book by the canonical hours in which the action happens (matins, lauds, prime, terce, etc.)  William of Baskerville is a medieval Sherlock without the attitude; he is humble yet shrewd, intelligent, sensible, honest, and open-minded enough to understand that monks are as human and fallible as everyone else.  The book is a learning experience as well as a reading experience, and earns top scores on both counts.<br /><br />Judy Lind	2001-03-25

Twice raped and impregnated by her philandering father and physically and sexually abused by her beast of a mother, Precious finds herself kicked out of junior high school when she is found to be pregnant a second time.  Instead of washing her hands of Precious, her guidance counselor refers her to an alternative school where Precious is taken in hand by a teacher who turns her life around by helping Precious to see that she is worth something in herself, and by forcing Precious to keep a diary that not only helps her to become literate but to examine the travesty that has been her life and decide where she wants her life to go.<br /><br />Precious is beginning to give her life some meaning; she's within striking distance of qualifying for her high school equivalency diploma and for the first time she feels she has a future, when this picture is blasted to bits by the revelation that her father not only impregnated her when he raped her, he also gave her HIV.  We don't know what is going to happen to Precious after the book ends; we only realize that this is a young woman who will very likely not see her thirtieth birthday.  But Precious is a survivor; she is bloodied but remains unbowed, and she is fiercely determined to give the time she has left her very best shot.

Rushdie is also a terrific humorist, and some sections of the book will have you on the floor laughing.  Above all,\\"Shame\\" is a tour-de force, a non-stop page-turner, a dizzying melange of allegory, parody, fantasy, mythology and modern history, told by a writer whose love/hate relationship with his country is reflected all over the book.

She is a case of conscience run amok, without any of the tempering graces of understanding or acceptance.  Whatever emotions Fanny engenders, hatred or loathing doesn't come into it; there is not enough in Fanny's character to loathe.  What she engenders in this reader is more like a profound sense of irritation; one wants to grab her by the shoulders, give her a good shake and tell her to lighten up.  Jane Austen's other heroines know how to leaven virtue with common sense and a dash of humor, none more so than Elizabeth Bennet in &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;; Fanny acts like she never cracked a joke in her life and wouldn't understand a joke if she heard one, let alone appreciate it.  She is thus a perfect match for her cousin Edmund, who is the most puzzling character in this excellent book.<br />I have never yet come across a sympathetic character in a novel who becomes so thoroughly unsympathetic as Edmund Bertram.  He certainly starts out as likeable enough, as Fanny's champion and protector from her obnoxious aunt Norris.  We can understand and sympathize when he falls in love with Mary Crawford, whose worldly upbringing makes her despise his vocation as a minister.  But Mary is torn between her materialistic ambitions and her genuine affection for Edmund.  She really loves him and appreciates his good qualities, as he is able to love her for hers; he realizes she is shallow and superficial, but she is also loving, kind, generous, open-hearted, and doesn't have a mean bone in her body.  She is &quot;the only woman he could ever want or accept for a wife.&quot;<br />So what happens to blow this whole scenario to bits?  In Edmund's eyes, Mary is insufficiently outraged by the adulterous relationship between her brother and Edmund's married sister.  Edmund is in anguish when Mary says she is disgusted by their stupidity in carrying on the affair.  For him, this proves she is totally without virtue.  But is she really?  Mary may have been as outraged as Edmund was; but where Edmund can only think of retribution, Mary is more concerned with damage control.  Where Edmund insists on divine and temporal punishment and damnation, Mary prefers to try to make the best of a bad situation.  For Edmund, Mary's common sense translates into vice.  From a paragon of virtue, she suddenly becomes a monster of licentiousness.  Edmund drops poor Mary like a hot potato.  He may thus endear himself further to Fanny Price, but he certainly doesn't endear himself to this reader.  Edmund comes across as a sanctimonious prig, more interested in judging people than in trying to understand and forgive.<br />So let the debate continue.

I'm looking forward to reading more opinions pro and con about Fanny Price &amp; Co.; the fundamental fact remains that, whatever you may think of Fanny and the other characters, Jane Austen is one of the greatest writers of all time in any language, and Mansfield Park is her greatest book.	2001-03-17

But it's a very good book, promising much better to come, a promise which was abundantly fulfilled in &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;.  Marianne's histrionics drove me up the wall.  It took a while for me to realize that Marianne is meant as a caricature; that Austen thinks her as ridiculous as she appears to the reader.  Witness Marianne's rhapsodizing about the fallen leaves at Norwood and Elinor cutting her short with her observation that &quot;not everybody shares your passion for dead leaves.&quot;  Elinor is the more sympathetic and likeable of the two sisters and Austen clearly identifies with her; Elinor's calm, rational sense and balance promises much better for happiness than Marianne's overblown romanticism.  We can see in this first book the emergence of an awesomely talented writer.	2001-03-17
US	52477572	REE9IVPYWOXOF	0899684432	306622732	The Other	Books	5	89	97	N	N	A truly great horror story	Once upon a time there was a somewhat forgettable actor named Thomas Tryon who starred in a series of very forgettable movies (\\"The Cardinal\\" and a few others). Mr. Tryon wisely decided to forget about the forgettable and sat down and wrote a spooky novel called \\"The Other\\". The result is an absolutely superb, un-put-downable, unforgettable horror story.<br /><br />\\"The Other\\" tells us the story of the Perry twins, Niles and Holland, 13 years old, identical twins born on either side of midnight and thus have not only different birthdays, but, in a true stroke of fictional genius, different astrological signs. They are thus as different as day from night, one friendly and sunny and outgoing, and the other deep, dark and diabolically evil. Their father is dead, their mother imprisoned inside her own creeping madness, and their grandmother, blessed or cursed with the Sight, is unable to stop the horror that is about to engulf the whole family.<br /><br />The story takes place mostly during a long, lazy Connecticut summer in the 1930's, and as the temperature cools down, the plot heats up. Two-thirds of the way through the book, Tryon divulges the twins' secret that will literally rock the reader in his tracks. You would think the rest of the book would be an anti-climax after this; fasten your seatbelts, because now you're in for a real ride. And hang on tight: Tryon piles one horror on top of another until you wonder if he has anything left in his bag of tricks, and then he pulls it out: a climax that will knock you over. And as if all this wasn't enough, the last page of the book will leave the reader wondering if Tryon was pulling the wool over everyone's eyes and have you guessing for days.<br /><br />Tryon may have been a mediocre actor, but he proved to be an excellent writer as well as a great storyteller. Plot, characters, and writing are just about perfect in this book. Like Stephen King in his earliest and best books, Tryon has the gift of understatement, and he knows how to let the horror build up ever so slowly and insidiously until the reader is totally wrapped up and can't escape. He also has a delightful touch with small but telling period descriptions that set the novel firmly in its time frame (do any older readers recall Mr. Coffee Nerves and Belle Sharmeers?). \\"The Other\\" has been out of print for some time now, but it's finally being re-printed and it's about time. I've treasured mine since the year it was published.

Philip Gourevitch writes an excellent, deeply researched and deeply felt book explaining WHAT happened in Rwanda in 1994, and HOW it happened; but I found myself trying to learn more about the WHY.  What makes people shed their humanity with no more apparent difficulty than a snake shedding its skin?  What are we to make of a Hutu priest who tells his Tutsi parishioners, just before he lets the Hutu militia invade his church where they were hiding and slaughtered all they could find, &quot;God no longer wants you&quot;?  Or another Hutu priest who refers to his Tutsi mother, to her face, as a &quot;cockroach&quot;?  Gourevitch has been castigated in some reviews for raising questions and not providing answers.  Perhaps to some questions, there aren't any answers.  We are left with a sinking feeling after reading this absorbing, well-written book, and a sickening realization that it could -- and probably will -- happen again... and again... and again.	2000-11-02

Bram Stoker brings the ancient vampire  lore vividly to life in this epistolary novel of the Transylvanian count  who comes to London in search of new blood and new victims.  Much more than  Frankenstein (a kind of boring monster, when all is said and done),  &quot;Dracula&quot; inspired a whole genre of horror stories based on  vampirism, of which Stephen King's &quot;Salem's Lot&quot; is one of the  best.  Some readers have complained of the epistolary style the book is  written in but I thought it helped carry the story along excellently.  And  with the exception of Lucy (all that fainting and whining does kind of get  on one's nerves), the characters are far from weak.  The book works on all  levels, as a great novel as well as a hellacious humdinger of a horror  story.	2000-08-26

Simpson	Books	5	12	16	N	N	A very well balanced investigation of the OJ Simpson trial	Whether or not you agree with the verdict is irrelevant; Jeffrey Toobin  has written an excellent account of the trial that mesmerized and  ultimately polarized the American public.  Toobin gives a dispassionate and  convincing analysis of the various legal stars: Johnny Cochran's grandstanding, Marcia Clark's arrogance, Chris Darden's bumbling  incompetence, and Barry Scheck, the nuts-and-bolts lawyer whose hard work  and diligence help swing the evidence in favor of his client.<br /><br />Toobin also  shows us the seamier side of the LAPD, most despicably manifested in the persona of Mark Fuhrman, the rogue cop whose racist ramblings helped undo the prosecution's case.  But Toobin also shows compellingly that in a Los  Angeles courtroom, the prosecution had no case; there was no way a LA jury,  made up mostly of members of ethnic groups who had been routinely victimized and brutalized by the LAPD for generations, was going to convict OJ Simpson, whom they saw as another black man being set up by a racist police force.  The fact that OJ Simpson was probably the \\"whitest\\" black man in America (he once said \\"I'm not black, I'm OJ\\") didn't matter to this jury; as one juror bluntly put it, \\"we have to take care of our own\\".<br /><br />The Simpson verdict split America right down the middle on racial lines: whites were outraged; blacks felt vindicated; whites were outraged that blacks felt vindicated; blacks were outraged at whites' hypocrisy (would whites have been so upset over the verdict had OJ been married to a black woman? and where was the outrage from whites when white men were routinely freed by all-white juries in the south after lynching black men with impunity?) and around and around it  goes.  There has been so much hysteria around the OJ Simpson trial and its  outcome that it is refreshing to read a factual, even-handed account such as Toobin gives us here.  It's a thoughtful, well researched, excellent work of journalism.<br /><br />Judy Lind	2000-08-19

David Simon and Edward Burns take the reader on a Dantean trip through hell, leading us  into the world of a drug-infested neighborhood in Baltimore.  Here we meet  Fat Curt, who keeps on keeping on until his body, ravaged from years of  drug abuse, gives out; Ella Thompson, who never gave up on the neighborhood  and its inhabitants; Gary and Fran, who threw the rich promise of their  lives away on drugs, and their son DeAndre, a manchild who may never reach  the promised land.  Burns and Simon get us intricately involved in the  lives of their subjects; and while we may react with disgust at Gary  keeping on a straight course aimed at hitting rock bottom, we also feel  sympathy and respect for Fran, who manages to get back up every time after  she falls down.  Above all, we feel the despair and disillusionment of the  young people who learn from a very early age that to the rest of America,  their lives have no meaning.  What do these youngsters, left for the most  part to raise themselves while their parents are strung out on drugs and  living for nothing but their next hit, have to look forward to, when their  role models are drug pushers and stickup men?  Simon and Burns have been  criticized for not offering answers, which would have lent an upbeat tone  to this book.  The criticism is beside the point.  They have no answers and  don't pretend to.  Their aim is to show the reader how this country's  &quot;anti-drug program&quot; is lacking in coherence, goals, or any kind  of common sense, and in this they succeed admirably.  What would have lent  additional interest to this book is some exploration of how some of the  people of the Corner, despite every strike being against them, manage to  make positive lives for themselves when others try and fail, and some never  seem to try at all: why is DeAndre still headed downhill when Preston, his  friend and partner in crime, turned his life around, married, found a job,  and moved his family out of the neighborhood?  Why has Blue, an old Corner  hand, stayed clean for three years when so many of his friends have died  from drugs?  How did Tyreeka, giving birth to DeAndre's son at age 14,  manage to avoid another out of wedlock pregnancy, finish high school and  look forward to college?  And where has Fran found the strength to keep  trying to get clean and stay clean when an overdose put Gary into a coffin?  We can only pray that Fran stays straight this time, that DeAndre pulls  his life out of the tailspin it has been going in, and that this country  finally develops a meaningful drug policy that will offer some hope and  some real assistance to the drug fiends on all of the nation's Corners.Preston, his  friend and partner in crime, turned his life around, married, found a job,  and moved his family out of the neighborhood?

He is  an Irish-American doorman with a passion for neon sculpture (picture, if  you can do it with a straight face, a neon Saint Sebastian shot full of  arrows).  From such disparate backgrounds do great love stories grow.  Kevin and Cornelia are two lonely young people, both having lost their  mothers to freak accidents, both looking for love and finding each other.  Cornelia's father is Chester Lord, of the great old-money firm Lord &amp;  Co., and she is engaged to Tucker Fisk, her father's young partner, who  gives a whole new definition to the word &quot;smarmy&quot;.  Tucker is out  to make &quot;30 by 30&quot;, meaning $30 million by his 30th birthday, and  means to engineer this feat by a hostile takeover of his prospective  father-in-law's corporation.

Whether or not you agree with Rand's politics or her  philosophy, you have to admit she is one terrific storyteller.  Rand gives  us a world set in a decade we can only guess at, in which the nations have  become &quot;People's States&quot; and the United States has grown bloated  and ineffectual with the code of &quot;collective responsibility&quot;.  Standing agianst the coming crash are a few intrepid industrialists whose  philosophy is from each according to his ability, to each according to his  output, never mind his needs; led by the enigmatic figure of John Galt, who  threatens to stop the motor of the world -- and does.  Rand has come down  as an apostle of selfishness and her socialistic villains are so evil as to  defy belief; but she makes a convincing case for the need for people to  think and act for themselves rather than surrender their brains and their  integrity to a governmental authority.  The sheer size of this book has  intimidated some readers, but Rand knows how to capture our interest and  hold onto it through almost twelve hundred pages.  You may not agree with  all of her premises, but she has combined some interesting characters and a  fascinating plot into a really great book.	2000-05-22

Alice Walker gives us Celie, 14 years old when the book opens, who has been raped, abused, degraded and twice impregnated by her father.  After he takes her children away from her without a so much as a word, he marries her off like a piece of chattel to her husband, who is  so cold, distant and inhuman to her that she can only refer to him as Mr; and this person deprives her of her sister Nettie, the only one who ever loved her.<br /><br />Celie manages to survive by living one day at a time.  Her life  is a series of flat, lifeless panoramas painted in browns and grays.  Into  this existence, if you can call it that, comes Shug Avery, her husband's  mistress, who shows Celie her own specialness and uniqueness.  A lot has  been made about lesbianism in this book and all of it is beside the point.  Celie isn't a lesbian, she is a human being in need of love and Shug Avery  helps Celie realize that she is somebody worth loving and caring about.  When Celie hurls her defiance into Mr's face -- \\"I'm poor, I'm black,  I may be ugly... but I'm here\\", she is making an affirmation not only  to him, but to the whole world; the reader can only say, along with Shug  Avery, \\"Amen\\".<br /><br />When Celie finds the strength to leave Mr, he is  left to face the reality of himself and what he sees isn't pretty; his  transformation humanizes him and allows Celie to call him Albert,  recognizing him as a person, as he finally recognizes her as one.  The last chapter makes many  readers go through half a box of Kleenex (Stephen Spielberg once said in an interview that he \\"cried and cried at the end\\" of the book), but Walker doesn't play cheap  with the reader's emotions; she has a powerful story to tell and she tells it with such consummate skill and sensitivity that she brings us into it and makes it ours.  This is a book to be treasured and read over and over  again.ead over and over  again.	2000-05-02

The first part is classic Cinderella with an interesting twist.  Jane is an orphan who is abused and mistreated by her  rich and evil stepmother and her nasty cousins; unlike Cinderella, Jane  stands up age age 10 and fights back.  She is promptly shunted off to a  school for girls from poor families, where she spends the next eight years.  Needing a change of scene and environment, she answers an advertisement  for a governess and enters the household of Mr. Rochester.  Rochester,  however, is no Prince Charming; he's 17 or 18 years older than Jane, hard,  bitter, cynical, selfish, and, unknown to all but a few, encumbered with a  wife who is the prototype of the \\"mad wife in the attic\\".  Rochester is a romantic at heart, however; he is captivated by Jane's innocence and simplicity.<br /><br />Many years' distance from junior high school has led me to re-think the entire creation of Mr. Rochester.  When all is said and done, he's a very curious romantic hero.  In fact, this guy is a world-class jerk.  What kind of \\"hero\\" would deliberately try to trap an innocent young girl into a sham marriage?  He makes all kinds of rationalizations to himself that his Maker will understand and approve of what he's doing, but come on, now, who is he kidding?  Imagine an alternative plot line midway through the book:  Jane doesn't write to her uncle in Madeira, so he remains ignorant of the planned wedding.  He doesn't send anyone to England to prevent it, so the wedding goes off as scheduled.  Five years and two or three children later, Jane finds out about Rochester's first marriage.  Can you imagine how she would feel?  Her marriage is a sham and her children are illegitimate.  What would she say?  How would she react?  And how would Mr. Rochester feel knowing he had brought this calamity on her by his own selfishness?  I don't know about war, but all is definitely not fair in love.  Mr. Rochester is a selfish ess-oh-bee.<br /><br />Anyway, the alternative never happened an we all know how the book really comes out so there is no sense in rehashing the plot; suffice to say that Bronte is a marvelous  storyteller.  The one problem I really have with Jane Eyre is the same that arises  in Bronte's other books, and that is her stifling insularity; she seems  unable to find value in anything that outside her own narrow, English  Protestant frame of reference.  However, this is a small caveat in this  book.  \\"Jane Eyre\\" is a classic romantic novel that has entranced  generations of readers and looks good for generations to come, flawed hero and all.<br /><br />Judy Lindn selfishness?

The heroine of &#34;Tenant&#34;,  Helen Graham, is a headstrong and independent young woman, who marries  Arthur Huntington against the advice of her family.  She is one of those who loves not wisely but too well, because Arthur, a selfish and  irresponsible womanizer, cares about nothing but satisfying his own wishes  and desires.<br /><br />Helen wants to help Arthur turn his life around, which Arthur  couldn't care less about, and his drinking and adultery right under her nose eventually repels her to the point where she despises him as much as  she once loved him.  It is only when she sees him attempting to influence her young son to become a chip off the old block, that she realizes her responsibility as a mother to save her son from his father trumps her duty as a wife to stand by her husband.  With the help of her brother, Helen runs away with her son to the anonymity of life in a small village.  Here she meets Gilbert Markham, who falls in love with her, but realizes that their relationship has no future as long as her husband is alive.  Arthur's ultimate death from alcoholism not only frees Helen from an abusive and degrading marriage, it also leaves her free to find happiness with Gilbert.<br /><br />Anne Bronte pulled no punches in writing this book and that is probably  what so perturbed readers of her own era; too bad for them, because they  were unable to appreciate this book for what it is, one of the unrecognized  classics of English literature.<br /><br />Judy Lindfor what it is, one of the unrecognized  classics of English literature.

It's a great companion volume to the TV special on the Discovery Channel, and a terrific book on its own.  The text  is well written, informative, and comprehensive to us lay readers, and the  pictures of dinosaurs are so real that you almost forget they are  computer-generated images; they look ready to walk right off the pages into  your living room.  I especially liked that along with the more familiar  standbys such as Diplodocus, Stegosaurus and Tyrannosaurus, Tim Haines  introduces us to dinosaurs most of us didn't know about before, such as  Placerias and Postosuchus from the early Triassic period; Ankylosaurus, who  could knock a Tyrannosaurus bowlegged; and Liopleurodon, a marine monster  who looks like he could chomp a small whale in half and finish off with a  couple of great white sharks for dessert.  Haines presents the argument for  warm-blooded dinosaurs very convincingly and his theory is backed by the  recent discovery of a four-chambered fossilized dinosaur heart in South  Dakota.  He presents the dinosaurs not as museum fossils but as living  beings who breathed, ate, slept, excreted, reproduced, and survived attack,  and where the evidence is scant, his suggestions for filling in the blanks  are so rational that we feel we are sharing a typical day in the life of a  prehistoric animal.  The photographs of the natural environment the  dinosaurs lived in help bring the whole era to life.  The final pages,  which describe the crash-landing in the Caribbean of the asteroid that  terminated the Mesozoic era, are written so vividly that we can almost  visualize the flash of light in the distant horizon and feel the shock wave  that spread over most of the earth and ended the age of the dinosaurs.  This is a wonderful book for the whole family which will be read and  referred to over and over again.	2000-04-21

The heroine of &quot;Persuasion&quot; is Anne Elliot, seven years  after she rejected, at her family's insistence, the young man she had  fallen in love with at 19, when he was just starting a naval career and was  too poor, in the eyes of her pretentious relatives, to be considered  acceptable marriage material.  Now he has returned, financially secure and  promoted to captain, and she finds herself still in love with him.  Without  giving away the rest of the plot, the book gives a powerful argument for  following one's heart instead of the prejudices and snobbisms of society.  Anne does not have the same appeal to many modern readers as Elizabeth  Bennet; she is more shy, retiring and reflective.  But as the book  progresses and she finds the strength to act on her feelings, she grows in  personality and character.  This final work by one of the greatest writers  (and my personal favorite) in the English language is a lasting testimony  to her incredible talents as a novelist.	2000-03-26

Scott Peck's bestselling book \\"The Road Less Travelled\\" seemed to make the assumption that people need a healthy dose of God to keep their psyches in sync, \\"People of the Lie\\" makes a case for the detrimental influence of the Devil.<br /><br />The mental health profession has generally been unwilling to label anyone as \\"evil\\", on the grounds that this is judgemental. Some people would try explain Hitler as being the product of an unhealthy home environment. As a clinical social worker, I once worked with a highly respected child psychiatrist whom I consulted about the case of a young mother who took every opportunity to use her six-year-old daughter as a human punching bag, when she wasn't using her as a football. The psychiatrist told me: \\"You know, some people are sick, and some are just mean\\"; i.e., they get a genuine pleasure out of hurting and demeaning other people. Peck writes about this latter group and suggests that these people could use a good exorcism to get the Devil out of their systems. In fact, in one of the later chapters of the book, Peck talks about having witnessed an exorcism which drove the malignant spirits out of a diabolically possessed individual.<br /><br />Peck sees \\"evil\\" people as those who attack others instead of facing their own failures, wreaking mayhem on the lives of everyone around them. Peck's definition of \\"evil\\" is \\"that which kills the spirit\\"; \\"goodness\\" being its opposite, \\"that which promotes life and liveliness\\". He further makes a relation between evil and sin. Evil people, he says, as opposed to other people, have \\"crossed the line\\" -- they absolutely refuse to tolerate the sense of their own sinfulness. Nothing they do is wrong.<br /><br />To back up his theory, Peck gives several case studies. The first concerns Bobby and his parents, two people who are so diabolical they seem to be caricatures. If they are really as Peck describes, they are hopeless of remedy, and Peck made the correct choice in getting Bobby away from these ghouls. Then there are Roger's parents, who seem to get their jollies out of beating Roger down mentally and emotionally to the point where he is little more than a robot. (Peck acknowledges that children are the most typical victims of evil people, given that they are the most vulnerable and helpless of human beings.) Then we meet Hartley and Sarah, locked in a vicious folie-a-deux, an evil wife whose browbeaten husband perpetuates the relationship, for God only knows what benefit to himself.<br /><br />Peck gives us \\"Charlene\\" as a \\"teaching case\\". Charlene is a young woman in her middle thirties who has just broken up with her boyfriend. She's a thoroughly exasperating individual who seems to enjoy looking on the dark side of everything. Peck goes into great detail discussing Charlene and how she bugged the hell out of him. But that is about all she does. What is so \\"evil\\" about her, he never explains, except that she refuses to bow down to the greater glory of God. In fact, this figures strongly in Peck's definition of evil, as he relates it to Erich Fromm's concept of \\"malignant narcissism\\": the willful failure of submission to a higher benevolent power. Broken down into its elemental components, Peck seems to be saying, if you won't believe in the greatness of God, you're evil.<br /><br />This is loaded stuff. Peck writes both as a clinician and as a Christian theologian and he seems to be attempting to create a synthesis of religion and psychiatry, which often leads him into some very muddled thinking, not to mention thinking which might be actually harmful to the patient. It's one thing to be strongly oriented to Christian values; it's another altogether to foist these values off on your patients under the guise of clinical therapy. Charlene may be a royal pain in the butt, and she comes across as such most of the time, but does her refusal to submit her will to God's truly make her evil? She doesn't seem to be hurting anyone but herself. If she had children, it's possible she would be a poor parent with her monumental selfishness and narcissism, but she doesn't. She's unable to sustain meaningful relationships but she doesn't seem to have harmed anyone in these short-term encounters; she appears to emerge much more damaged than her partners. So what's so evil about her? Peck never explains this adequately and given his own definition of evil, I'm not sure Charlene even qualifies as a \\"teaching case\\".<br /><br />Peck's muddled thinking shows up even more clearly in the case he describes as \\"group evil\\", the American massacre of over 200 non-combatants at My Lai in 1968. On the one hand, he excoriates the participants for their inability or unwillingness to accept responsibility for their actions. On the other, he discusses the helplessness of soldiers who are told to follow orders. He can't have it both ways. If Peck wanted to do a study of group evil, he would much better have used the Wannsee Conference of 1941, in which a group of high-ranking Nazis put the finishing touches on the plan for the Final Solution. These men weren't following orders, they were actually preparing orders. Using the grunts at My Lai as an example of \\"group evil\\" simply weakens his case.<br /><br />Throughout the book, Peck talks about the difficulty he has as therapist in relating to some of these patients. He tells us he terminated the therapeutic relationship with Bobby's parents as soon as he could because they revolted him. Well, you can't blame him for that; Bobby's parents would nauseate anybody remotely human. But his reaction to Charlene seems as overblown as his diagnosis of her as \\"evil\\". He discusses Charlene's failure to regress to childhood as the determining factor which caused her therapy to fail. Peck is very big on regression. In his view, the only way for a patient to heal is to regress emotionally to the level of a child and trust to the therapist's \\"paternal ministrations\\". He doesn't seem to recognize how patronizing and demeaning this can seem to the patient. He sees Charlene as a spoiled child and conveys this attitude to her, and then he wonders why her therapy failed.<br /><br />In his earlier book \\"The Road Less Travelled\\", Peck says on Page 175 that he would have sex with a patient if he thought it would be beneficial to the patient. When I picked myself up off the floor after reading that statement (Peck later said he'd omit it from subsequent editions) I wondered how in the world he could imagine for a moment that a sexual relationship between a patient and a therapist, which is generally recognized as being so damaging to the patient that it is grounds for disciplinary action in just about every state in the union (suspension of the therapist's professional license), could possibly help the patient. In \\"People of the Lie\\" he wonders if he should have held Charlene like a child who needs comforting and nurturing. One wonders if maybe Peck needs a refresher course in the fundamental boundaries in the patient/therapist relationship.<br /><br />Peck writes well; I'll give him that much. He expresses his ideas clearly and succinctly with examples to back them up. He starts off by saying \\"This is a dangerous book.\\" Well, it can be, but not in the way he thinks it is. The danger, for this reviewer at least, is Peck using therapy as a vehicle for expressing his religious convictions, and possibly labeling as \\"evil\\" anyone who doesn't conform with them.<br /><br />I finished this book thinking that Peck has some interesting ideas that could be fruitfully explored. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of psychiatric disorders doesn't recognize \\"evil\\" as any kind of psychiatric entity, but as Peck illustrates in the cases of Bobby's and Roger's parents and with Hartley and Sarah, there are some individuals out there who don't appear to be emotionally impaired in any other sense than that they thrive off others' misery. They don't just thrive off it; they feed off itlike vampires. That may be the most fundamental definition of evil yet. There's a lot out there to be researched.

Unlike &quot;Jane Eyre&quot;, &quot;Villette&quot; is no Cinderella tale, and  there is no Rochester to stir the heroine's -- and the reader's --emotions.  In &quot;Villette&quot;, Bronte gives us Lucy Snowe, whom she resembled in  many ways: plain, prim, no-nonsense, practical to a fault, and suffering  the pains of unrequited love. Unlike the happy ending which delighted us in  &quot;Jane Eyre&quot;, Lucy finds a hope of happiness at last with M. Paul  Emanuel, only to have her prospects shipwrecked literally and figuratively  at the end of the book.  Many readers have a problem with Bronte's liberal  use of French throughout the book which disrupts the narrative, and her  forays into Gothic romanticism, which seem contrived and artificial.  A  more serious problem, for this reviewer, is Bronte's insularity and her  narrow-minded frame of reference which rejects anything un-English and  un-Protestant.  Even with these flaws, &quot;Villette&quot; is a deep,  thought-provoking portrayal of the pain of lost illusions.	2000-03-11

It was \\"race medicine\\" of the worst kind and, as a newspaper editorial stated when the experiment finally came to light 40 years later, it was ethically on a par with the medical experiments in the Nazi death camps.<br /><br />The men selected for the study were for the most part  uneducated (only one man had reached the eighth grade and none had gone to high school), they were never explained the purpose of the study, and they were given no medicine to help their advancing symptoms.  Even after  penicillin was found in the 1940s to halt or significantly reduce the symptoms of the disease, it was withheld from the patients, who were left to suffer horrible deaths from advanced syphilis one by one.<br /><br />In 1972 the experiment was finally  brought into the open by a young law student who passed the information to the Associated Press, and when the story broke on Page One of newspapers across the country, it caused a national firestorm.  Journalists, public  officials, and ordinary citizens were outraged by the news accounts.  Incredibly, when the doctors involved in the experiment were asked for an  accountability, their response was a collective shrug and a \\"so what?\\"<br /><br />The most explosive reaction, needless to say, was in the  nation's black communities, which maintained that the government would never have run such an experiment on 400 white test subjects.  The bitter legacy left by the Tuskegee Experiment is the fear and mistrust among many  African-Americans of the entire medical establishment, and the suspicion that AIDS is a man-made disease created by the government with the express purpose of killing off blacks and gays; people who hold this belief, when asked why they think the government would do such a thing, invariably point to the Tuskegee Experiment as an example of what the government is capable of.

Crichton missed his  true vocation; he should have been a high school science teacher.  He has a  rare gift for taking difficult and incomprehensible scientific topics and  making them interesting and even fun for all us techno-dummies.<br /><br />\\"The  Andromeda Strain\\" tells the story of a space capsule returning to  earth bringing a very unwelcome hitch-hiker in the form of a microscopic  organism that reproduces exponentially and acts out in all kinds of nasty  ways.  It's timely and topical and raises the age-old question, could it  actually happen?  As Crichton suggests, there may be all kinds of  surprises, both pleasant and unpleasant, lurking out in deep space waiting  to be brought back to Earth, and we had better be ready for them.<br /><br />The 58 references for further reading listed in the back of the book are probably  meant to whet our interest further, although none of them are probably half  as interesting as this book is.

The book raised a firestorm when it was due to be released; feminists condemned it as misogynistic trash, and when  it was finally published, it was in a trade paperback version because the  publisher which was to publish the hardcover version pulled it to avoid all the controversy.  All hell will probably break loose when the movie comes  out, if it is in any way true to the book.<br /><br />Ellis gives us Yuppie Manhattan in full effect, where the only things that count are money and designer labels; real people are faceless nonentities with interchangeable names, everyone seems to have a Peter Pan complex, dreading the inexorable  approach of the big 3-0, and the defining characteristic of the time is its all-encompassing materialism.  The anti-hero of \\"American  Psycho\\", Patrick Bateman, is a serial killer with a penchant for torturing and murdering young women in a quest to give his empty existence some meaning.  Bateman is perfect on the surface; he's young (26), handsome, expensively dressed, lives in a trendy condo on the trendy Upper West Side, makes six figures on Wall Street, and can reel off designer names at the drop of a hat.  He can glance at anyone for a split second and tell who designed each item of his or her visible apparel.  Bateman's life is so devoid of meaning that he thinks all this superficial knowledge actually matters.  He can't love anyone, including himself; he treats friends, lovers and acquaintances with equal contempt; and he is totally devoid of compassion, tenderness, remorse, warmth, or anything remotely resembling a conscience.  If he has a date with a young woman, it may or may not end in his torturing her to death; as he comments early in the book, \\"This is simply the way the world -- my world -- moves.\\"<br /><br />The book was indicted mainly on account of its shock value, and some of the murders are so revolting that you'll want to reach for the Alka-Seltzer.  But murder and mayhem aside, the spiritually empty, shallow and soulless  people portrayed in \\"American Psycho\\" pretty much represent the  spiritual emptiness, shallowness and soullessness of the 1980s.  Ellis overdid the blood and gore, and the relentless recitation of designer names does become wearying after the first fifty pages, but again, this only serves to emphasize the numbing emptiness of Bateman's inner self.  \\"American Psycho\\" is a telling portrait of an age of material excess when nothing that really matters, mattered.<br /><br />Judy Lindlue, and some of the murders are so revolting that you'll want to reach for the Alka-Seltzer.

This Penguin Classics compilation features one novel unpublished in her lifetime and two unfinished fragments.  This book is proof that even an incomplete Austen is better than no Austen at all.<br /><br />\\"Lady Susan\\"  is an epistolary novel whose eponymous anti-heroine, unlike the women  featured in Austen's other works, is bad to the bone.  When the book opens,  Lady Susan, a stunningly beautiful widow in her upper thirties, has just been sent packing from the home of a family she had spent some months with, having been discovered carrying on a flagrant affair with the husband of  the family, right under his wife's nose.  She takes refuge with her kind-hearted brother and his sensible wife, who sees through Lady Susan from the day she enters the house and can't wait to see her leave.<br /><br />Also in  the home are Lady Susan's teenage daughter, who has been expelled from  boarding school after attempting to run away so that she won't be forced  into marrying the rich, fatuous nobleman her mother has picked out for her;  and the younger brother of Lady Susan's sister-in-law, who has heard intimations about Lady Susan's unsavory reputation; in retaliation for his initial disdain, Lady Susan sets out to captivate him and succeeds so well that she has him on the brink of proposing marriage to her, despite the  fact that he is 12 years younger than she is, much to the alarm of his  family.  It looks as though he is about to fall into her clutches, when a  chance meeting between him and the wife of Lady Susan's lover blows all  Lady Susan's machinations, as well as her reputation, to smithereens.<br /><br />Lady  Susan, to save what is left of her honor, ends up marrying the rich,  fatuous nobleman she intended for her daughter; Jane Austen slyly hints  that Lady Susan and her married lover will continue their affair under the  noses of both their spouses.  The book's ending is in a narrative style  that appears simply tacked on, as if Austen got tired of both the story and  the epistolary style she wrote it in; but on the whole, it's an enjoyable  read, interesting mostly because it is so different in style and content  from the books we're familiar with.<br /><br />\\"The Watsons\\" is a delight  from beginning to middle; I can't say \\"end\\" because, unfortunately, Austen never finished it.  It's very much in the style of  her six major works.  Emma Watson is the youngest child of a large family  and has been raised by her rich aunt since early childhood; she is thrown  back on her impoverished family when her aunt makes an ill-advised second  marriage.  She is thus reintroduced at the age of 19 to her terminally ill  father, two brothers and three unmarried sisters.  Emma is a refreshingly original heroine very much in the style of Elizabeth Bennet; she's bright, astute, spirited, perceptive, down to earth, and unimpressed with mere good  looks and money.  She has no problem rejecting the town casanova who thinks  he's all that and a bag of chips; nor is she especially impressed by the young lord of the manor who is infatuated with her.  A footnote to the  story says that Jane Austen told her sister how the book was to end; we could have guessed it even without the footnote, but it's a great story and  would surely have been included in her major works if only she had lived to complete it.<br /><br />\\"Sanditon\\" is probably the best known of Austen's  unpublished works; it's also a fragment of a novel, very different in  content from her finished works.  Austen excels in writing about manners  and morals; \\"Sanditon\\" is more about social commentary, and  somehow, it doesn't work as well.  The characters in \\"Sanditon\\"  are not as interesting or compelling as the people in her other works; they  are not nearly as well drawn; they're more like sketches or caricatures  than three-dimensional persons.  It's difficult to tell how she would have  ended the book, and there's not really enough interest to the plot to make  us want to know.  \\"Sanditon\\" is the weakest of the three stories  in this volume, but \\"The Watsons\\" and \\"Lady Susan\\" more  than make up for its defects.  One can see in these two works the  development of a great writer.<br /><br />Judy Lindhe plot to make  us want to know.  \\"Sanditon\\" is the weakest of the three stories  in this volume, but \\"The Watsons\\" and \\"Lady Susan\\" more  than make up for its defects.

The dry, almost understated tone of the writing lends itself superbly to the terror building ever so slowly, ever so insidiously, until he hits  us dead on with &quot;the high, sweet, evil laughter of a child... and then  the sucking sounds&quot;. From there, the horror explodes as victim after  victim falls prey to the monstrosity that has taken over this small town in  southeastern Maine. King is a master at interspersing the horror with  flashes of humor (his description of the town drunks driving out to the  haunted dump is a howler) and, unlike some of his later over-long books in  which the story drags on and on and on, in &quot;Salem's Lot&quot; he knew  where to end it. For those fans who hoped for a sequel, check out &quot;One  For the Road&quot; in King's collection of short stories called &quot;Night  Shift&quot;; it's set in Salem's Lot, and the vampires are back... and  very, very thirsty.	2000-02-22

Harry Potter rides again, and the action is fast and furious and better than ever.  JK Rowling has a wicked sense of humor (her description of Harry's godawful, inflated Aunt Marge bouncing around the ceiling almost had me rolling on the floor), and in the Dementors, she has invented one of  the most frightening characters I've ever come across in children's or  adult literature, a being so implacably evil it will steal your very soul.  The series so far lives up to its original promise; it's a dizzying joyride  of fun, fantasy and escapism.  And as for the hopeless killjoys who claim  the books promote witchcraft and the occult: puh-leeze, how many children  turned into Satanists after reading &quot;Hansel and Gretel&quot; or  &quot;Snow White&quot;?

That honor is reserved for \\"Mansfield Park\\", a much deeper work.  But it's almost everybody's favorite Austen, including mine, as much for the unforgettable characters as for the story.<br /><br />Elizabeth Bennet is the perfect  heroine: she's bright, sharp, likeable, perceptive, nobody's fool, infinitely fallible, like all of us; but, unlike most of us, able to see and admit when she is in the wrong. Unlike her wacky mother and her shallow younger sisters, she does not see snaring a husband as her sole object in life, and thus she is supremely capable of putting Mr. Darcy in his place.  Darcy's progression from an insufferable snob to an empathetic human being  results from the realization that money and an old name are insufficient  recommendations to a woman with real class, intelligence and character.<br /><br />Elizabeth's family is also well portrayed.  We can understand why Elizabeth  is her father's favorite child; he is as sharp and perceptive as she is, totally sensible and down to earth, a perfect foil for the ditzy Mrs. Bennet, who is so ridiculous you wish a chandelier would fall on her head, obsessed with marrying off her five eligible daughters.  We know how the book is going to end almost as soon as it begins; Jane will hook Mr. Bingley in spite of the machinations of his nasty sisters, and Elizabeth, of course, will become Mrs. Darcy.<br /><br />\\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is very much of it's time, set at the end of the 18th century, but it's been loved by generations of readers for the past two hundred years and looks good for at least another two hundred.  It's quintessential Jane Austen.<br /><br />Judy Lind	2000-02-11

Some black parents and students have charged  that the book is humiliating and demeaning to African-Americans and  therefore is unfit to be taught in school.  If there has been a racist  backlash in the classroom, I think it is the fault of the readers rather  than the book.<br /><br />\\"Huckleberry Finn\\" is set in Missouri in the  1830's and it is true to its time.  The narrator is a 13 year old,  semi-literate boy who refers to blacks by the N-word because he has never  heard them called anything else.  He's been brought up to see blacks as  slaves, as property, as something less than human.  He gets to know Jim on  their flight to freedom (Jim escaping slavery and Huck escaping his  drunken, abusive father), and is transformed.  Huck realizes that Jim is  just as human as he is, a loving father who misses his children, a warm,  sensitive, generous, compassionate individual.  Huck's epiphany arrives  when he has to make a decision whether or not to rescue Jim when he is  captured and held for return to slavery.  In the culture he was born into,  stealing a slave is the lowest of crimes and the perpetrator is condemned  to eternal damnation.  By his decision to risk hell to save Jim, he saves  his own soul.  Huck has risen above his upbringing to see Jim as a friend,  a man, and a fellow human being.<br /><br />Another charge of racism is based on  Twain's supposed stereotyping of Jim.  As portrayed by Twain, Jim is hardly  the ignorant, shuffling Uncle Tom that was so prevalent in \\"Gone With  the Wind\\" (a book that abundantly deserves the charge of racism).  Jim  may be uneducated, but he is nobody's fool; and his dignity and nobility in  the face of adversity is evident throughout the book.<br /><br />So -- is  \\"Huckleberry Finn\\" a racist book?  No.  It's of its time and for  its time and ours as well, portraying a black man with sensitivity,  dignity, and sympathy.  If shallow, ignorant readers see Jim as a  caricature and an object of derision, that's their problem.  Hopefully they  may mature enough in their lifetime to appreciate this book as one of the  greatest classics of American literature.<br /><br />And for those who might be  wondering -- this reviewer is black.<br /><br />Judy Linde uneducated, but he is nobody's fool; and his dignity and nobility in  the face of adversity is evident throughout the book.<br /><br />So -- is  \\"Huckleberry Finn\\" a racist book?

A monster was loose, and its prey was black children.  Was this monster singular or plural, and was its name Wayne Williams or KKK?  We don't know for sure,  and we may never know.  But Toni Cade Bambara has effectively caught the  sense of a community under siege by a nameless, faceless killer on the very  first page of the book's prologue: &quot;It's 3:23... and your child is  nowhere in sight.&quot;  Bambara lets the reader share the mood of the  people who lived through it -- the parents whose children disappeared; the  parents whose children were spared, wondering if their child might be next;  the children, some of whom had friends among the victims, living in fear  that it could happen to them too.  Was Wayne Williams the true killer or a  convenient scapegoat?  Those who believe the former point to the fact that  the murders stopped when he was arrested.  This is a powerful, disturbing,  controversial book.  All the better.  The Atlanta child murders needs all  the light shed on them that they can get.	2000-01-27

Lia's doctors see her family as negligent and ignorant because their inability to follow a complicated  medical regimen makes her condition deteriorate; her family see the doctors as arrogant and insensitive, and insist the medicine they are giving her actually made her sicker.  The tragedy is that both the doctors and the family genuinely want to help Lia, but their total lack of communication  and inability to understand each other, linguistically and culturally, makes cooperation impossible.  Those of us in the 'helping' professions (medicine, nursing, social work) often lose sight of the fact that the relationship between 'helper' and 'helpee' is most effective when each sees the other as an equal partner who deserves equal consideration and respect; instead, the 'helpers' often dole out advice and directions which the 'helpees' are expected to follow without question, and are then labeled backwards, resistant, or even negligent, when they refuse.<br /><br />The book zeroes in on the dangers of ethnocentric thinking in working with or treating people of different cultures; the Lees may have been illiterate and 'backwards' by American cultural standards, but they knew and loved their child.  We end up admiring and respecting the Hmong for their warm family life and their support of each other in times of crisis, as well as  respecting the medical personnel who grew as human beings as they came to recognize the Lees' humanity and their incredible strengths as parents.  Many, if not most, American families would institutionalize a child such as Lia; but to her family, the sicker she became, the more precious she  became.  Anne Fadiman has given us an informative, excellently researched, uplifting and yet humbling book about a very special family and a very special child.<br /><br />Judy Lindgiven us an informative, excellently researched, uplifting and yet humbling book about a very special family and a very special child.

'Waiting to Exhale' adds up to a few stereotypical caricatures plus a somewhat raggedy plot... so why was the book so popular? For one thing, it is falling-down-funny; for another, it tells a few home truths; and mainly, because the characters are people all of us have known at one time or  another, regardless of ethnic or class background: Bernardine is every wife  whose despicable jerk of a husband dumps her for a younger woman; Robin and  Savannah are every woman with a genius for picking the wrong man; Russell is every wrong man; and Michael is every wrong right man (good husband  material and zero in bed).  We've all been there before.<br /><br />McMillan clearly has sympathy for her four female protagonists; Robin may be dumber than a box of rocks when it comes to men, but you can't help liking her.  McMillan is not a very deep writer  and WTE is not a very deep book, but it's funny, perceptive, well written, and well worth reading.<br /><br />Judy Lind	2000-01-19

I'm glad I discovered WSS much later.  It's an intriguing, fascinating study of Mr. Rochester and his first wife, Antoinette Mason, the prototype of the 'mad wife in the attic' who played a minor but vital part in 'Jane Eyre'.<br /><br />Antoinette's mother descends into madness following the loss of the family  estate to a slave rebellion.  To shore up the family fortune and save her from becoming an old maid, and thus a burden, she is married off to Mr. Rochester, newly arrived from England, who knows nothing about her mother's insanity.  WSS shows us the other side of Mr. Rochester that Jane Eyre couldn't or wouldn't see: his coldness, his selfishness, and his opportunism.  We can understand how, as he did in 'Jane Eyre', such a man would lie to an innocent young woman about his marital status and nearly trap her into unwittingly participating in a sham marriage.  Rochester is attracted to Antoinette at first; he is dazzled by her beauty as well as her money and eager to marry her.  Once the honeymoon phase is over, he is unable to adjust to his surroundings.  Jamaica is antipathetic to everything he grew up with, it's wild, untamed, a study in extremes, anathema to a tidy, organized, narrow-minded European, and Rochester is the typical insular-minded Englishman who despises what he is unable to  understand.<br /><br />Antoinette is totally a product of her surroundings and completely at home where she is, and as Rochester feels alienated from Jamaica, so he feels alientated from his wife, and the discovery of her mother's insanity is justification enough for his deepening antipathy for her.  He can't accept who or what she is; he can't even accept her name, he  insists on calling her 'Bertha', never mind that it's a name she hates,  it's what he wants, so it's who she will be.  In 'Jane Eyre', Rochester  blames his wife's alcoholism for the failure of the marriage; in WSS, it's his brutally cold and insensitive treatment of her that finally drives her to drink.  When he takes her away from Jamaica and everything she knows and loves, she retreats into a madness even deeper than her mother's; she can't live in his world, any more than he can live in hers.<br /><br />In 'Jane Eyre' Rochester is the romantic hero and in WSS he is a monster of selfishness; when both are put together, the real complexity of the character finally emerges.<br /><br />Judy Linde will be.

I have never seen or heard of so many people condemning a book  they never read.  If this isn't the height (or depth) of ignorance, tell me what is.<br /><br />The Satanic Verses is a tour de force.  I have read it three times since it was first published and it still fascinates me.  There is so much happening in this book that it is several books in one.  Those who are upset at the protagonist's ravings against Islam don't seem to realize that these are the ravings of a disturbed mind; Gibreel is a paranoid schizophrenic whose tortured fantasies can only end in the tragedy that  finally releases him from his inner hell.<br /><br />Rushdie is an incredibly gifted writer: one moment he is laughing-out-loud funny, and at other times his prose verges on the poetic.

In fact, most people who saw or heard of 'The Bad Seed' as a play or a movie never knew it was derived from William March's terrific book.<br /><br />March tells the story of Rhoda Penmark, eight years old, a devil lurking inside an angel's facade.  To her adult neighbors, she's every parent's dream: obedient, unassuming, compliant, always neat and well-groomed, quiet, polite to her  elders.  She does her homework without being prodded and she gets all the answers correct on her Sunday school quiz.  Those who know her more intimately suspect there's something ugly underneath all the surface charm; her peers can't stand her, her teachers see a disturbing lack of feeling or sensitivity in her, and her parents, who dote on her, wonder if she is capable of love, affection, remorse, or any of the characteristics that make us human.  For Rhoda goes after what she wants with a single-minded purposefulness and anybody who gets in her way better watch out.<br /><br />Rhoda's father is absent throughout all but the last few pages of the book (he's away on a business trip that is important to his career advancement), so Christine, her mother, is left to deal with Rhoda on her own.  Christine is a fascinating character, one of the most tragic in contemporary fiction, a decent, compliant, earnest woman, whose identity is totally bound up in being a good wife and a devoted mother; what she learns about her own history shatters her world, especially when she realizes that her daughter is the 'bad seed' she unwittingly transmitted from her own diabolical mother.  And as Christine cannot accept that she is blameless in this transmission, that she did not cause her daughter's criminal behavior any more than she caused her own mother's, so she feels she must not drag anyone else, even her husband, into her private hell; she created it, so she must deal with it alone, and it undoes her.<br /><br />How else could Christine have acted, is left to the reader to speculate.  I'm not going to tell how the book ended, except to say that it's a much more satisfying (because more realistic) ending than in the movie.  But it's a spooky little gem of a horror story that deserves a much wider readership.  It's well written, well plotted, and a great read.

Afer hearing of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone as being either 1) a great children's book or 2) something akin to a witches' bible, I bought this book, as so many others have done, simply to see what all the Harry  Potter hype was about.  As a middle-aged adult whose taste in books ranges  from literature to history to current events, may I say that I have seldom  enjoyed a book as much as this one.  I wonder if the benighted people who  condemn JK Rowlings as guilty of promoting Satanism also pass the same  verdict on Hans Christian Anderson and the Brothers Grimm.  The book was  fun, fantasy, and pure escapism, and that is all it sets out to be.  On all  three counts, it succeeds brilliantly.  I finished the first book yesterday  and am looking forward to reading the sequels... hopefully, all six.  Kudos  to Rowling for creating an instant -- and enduring -- classic for all ages.

You can't read Morrison once; every book she writes is a treasure, but she makes you work for it.  'Beloved' tells the story of Sethe, an escaped slave who finds sanctuary in  Ohio, and posits the unanswerable question: is it possible to kill someone  out of love?  When the slavecatchers find Sethe in hiding, she kills her  youngest child, Beloved, to spare her from being taken back into the hell  Sethe escaped from.  Her act can be viewed as horrific (as her lover, Paul  D, reacts when he tells her 'you got two legs, not four'), or as  desperation; Morrison lets you decide for yourself.  Beloved's ghost  returns and causes all kinds of chaos in the house, and her actions raise  the question of just who is Beloved -- is she some kind of demon, or is she  a lost soul searching for love so she can finally find peace?  This is one  of the most powerful, disturbing, and ultimately uplifting books I have  ever read.  As I said, Morrison makes you work for the treasure hidden her  books, but the search, and the reward, make it all worthwhile.	1999-12-27

But for pure escapist reading, he's hard to top.  And who but Chrichton could make scientific and technological subjects not only  interesting, but even fun, for all us technophobes out there?  TIMELINE  (complete with a bibliography containing 80 references on the Middle Ages  and ten on parallel worlds) tells a story of a group of scientists who step  into a time machine and travel back to France in the 1300's to rescue a  friend who preceded them and got stuck, in a world which proves to be a far  more violent and frightening place than Geoffroy or Christine de Pizan ever  wrote about.  They have 37 hours to find their friend and get him and  themselves safely back to the present.  The ensuing day and a half turns  out to be a typical Chrictonian roller-coaster ride and we know pretty much  how it will turn out (and, yes, the villain gets his, and a good job, too),  but if you take the book for what it is, it's fun and enjoyable.  And some  of his references are definitely worth pursuing (check out Michio Kaku's  'Hyperspace', for one).  Say what you want about Chrichton's deficits as a  writer, he gets you wanting to know more about what he writes about, and  that, by itself, makes him a good read.	1999-12-27
US	52477572	R1UW7X3WE56R25	0060194995	994527755	To Kill a Mockingbird	Books	5	0	0	N	N	A contemporary classic for all time	What do you do when you sit down to write a book and you get it absolutely perfect the first time? Unfortunately, you never write another one. How could Harper Lee have possibly followed this up? Anything she wrote after \\"To Kill A Mockingbird\\" would have been anticlimax. So on the strength of one book, Harper Lee will be forever remembered for writing one of the greatest books of the contemporary American literature.<br /><br />I picked up this book late one night the year it was first published, after my mom had been raving about the book for weeks, trying to get me to read it. Well, what the heck, the late movie was boring that evening... next thing I knew, it was two o'clock in the morning and I had just turned the final page on what was the most magical reading experience of my entire life.<br /><br />From the opening line, \\"When he was nearly thirteen, my brother Jem got his arm badly broken at the elbow...\\" Lee hooks the reader with a deceptively simple story of a Southern family and a Southern town caught up in a cataclysmic moral crisis, and keeps us enthralled till the very last word. Lee's writing style is that of the storyteller who mesmerizes her audience telling a tale so simple, yet so compelling, that you never want it to end. Her narrator is Scout Finch, a delightfully devilish little tomboy who sees her world through the all-observant eyes of childhood. Scout is one of the most enchanting characters in modern American fiction. She's bright, funny, totally real; there's nothing contrived about her. She's someone we all knew in first or second grade, or wished we'd known. Scout lives with her brother Jem, four years her senior, her lawyer father Atticus, and their housekeeper Calpurnia, in a sleepy Alabama town where everybody knows or is related to everybody else. Lee spends the first half of the book drawing us into the life of the town and the Finch family, Scout's hilarious and problematic adjustment to first grade, and brings us into the mystery surrounding the notorious-yet-never-seen Boo Radley. The second half of the book is about the moral crisis that tears the town apart.<br /><br />Lee has a way of saying a lot by saying very little, and her laconic statement that the people of Maycomb had recently been told they had nothing to fear but fear itself sets the time squarely in 1933, the depths of the Great Depression. Times were bad for most people in small Southern towns; they were especially bad for poor whites and all blacks. In 1933 the South was rigidly segregated down every possible line, and a white woman's false accusation of rape was enough to get a black man hanged. When Mayella Ewell accuses Tom Robinson of rape, in the eyes of most of the white populace, Tom has been tried, convicted and is awaiting execution. Judge Taylor disagrees, and asks Atticus to take Tom's case.<br /><br />In Atticus Finch, Lee created what would eventually grow to be the best-loved character in all American fiction. Atticus is a loving but not a doting father, an able lawyer, and an individual of towering integrity. He takes Tom's case because he knows Mayella's accusation is full of holes, and he believes Tom is as deserving of good legal representation as anyone else. Atticus knows better than anyone else how his decision to take the case will affect his children, but as he explains to Scout, who wonders how Atticus can be right if everybody else thinks he's wrong, if he didn't take the case, he could never hold his head up in front of his children again.<br /><br />Atticus knows he's fighting a losing battle, but deep inside himself he believes he may lose a battle but win a bigger war. The chapters describing Tom Robinson's trial and Atticus's defense are some of the most powerful in American fiction. On of the most moving passages in the book is at the end of the trial when the town's black minister tells Scout to \\"Stand up. Your father's passin'.\\"<br /><br />Along with Scout and Atticus Finch, Lee created a host of other memorable characters. Jem is the perfect big brother for Scout, sometimes protective, sometimes antagonistic, always encouraging. Lee only needs to pen a few details about Calpurnia to bring her vividly to life: \\"She was all angles and bones; she squinted; her hand was wide as a bed slat and twice as hard.\\" Calpurnia isn't the stereotypical Mammy of Tara; she's a no-nonsense maid and housekeeper who dishes out ample amounts of love and old-fashioned discipline in equal doses. And Miss Maudie Atkinson is a delightful creation; funny, ditzy, and wise all at once. Anyone would want her for their next-door neighbor.<br /><br />The two major villains, Bob Ewell and his daughter Mayella, are compelling characters in their own right. Bob Ewell is quintessential white trash, spending the family's relief money on moonshine while his children go hungry. But poor Mayella is as much victim as villain; we can't help but feel for her, ostracized and isolated, knowing only her father's physical violence and sexual abuse; her attempted seduction of Tom Robinson is a desperate cry for love and affection. But, as Lee reminds us, it's all for naught. Tom Robinson was dead the minute Mayella, caught in the act of attempted seduction by her father, opened her mouth and screamed.<br /><br />After the highlight of the trial, the book might have slid into anticlimax, but it's Lee's genius that she keeps the tension heightened after the trial and its denouement, through Ewell's drunken, insane attack on Atticus through his children, and their rescue by Boo Radley. And after everything she, her family, and the town have been through, what has Scout learned from all this? Pretty much what Atticus set out to teach her all along: that you can't get to know a person until you put on his shoes and walk around in them.<br /><br />I turned the final page of \\"To Kill A Mockingbird\\", unbelieving that it had come to an end. I opened the front cover and immediately started reading it over again from page one. The book had that much of an effect on me. One doesn't just read this book; one experiences it.
