As a result we are left with people endlessly praising predictable, tone deaf hack work, such as the egregious products of Stephen King or Larry Niven, while ignoring real masterpieces in the genre, for example, this mini-classic from Neal Barrett, Jr.    This book has a sequel that is also well above the genre average, though not as good as the original. Don't hesitate to purchase them both if you're that rarest of birds, a fan of the genre who actually appreciates good writing and original ideas.	2005-09-07

In reality, if anything, the female sex and the also-ran cultures are over-represented in this book. That isn't the problem. The problem is, the methodology on which this study is based reduces to a popularity contest among academics, which, as anybody who has spent five minutes around academics ought to know, is not a very good way to determine the quality, truth or beauty of anything. Michelangelo the greatest artist? No doubt. Picasso second? Ridiculous. Picasso has been written about disproportionately because he was an ingenious, self-promoting hack. Aristotle the greatest philosopher? Most written about historically, certainly, but I can't believe any but a few cobwebbed classicists would, in this day and age, consider him the greatest. Personally I would take the pre-socratics anyway, but Plato is the most influential Western philosopher. And what if he did a survey of social scientists? An outright fraud who has now been utterly discredited, Sigmund Freud, would quite possibly finish first according to Murray's method.<br /><br />Genius is not democratic. That's the reason the pc crowd hates Murray; his works make this fact obvious. But in this case, he seems to be defining greatness by popular vote. It makes no sense. The book is a fascinating novelty and a fine history lesson, but no more.	2004-12-31

It is this that gives his books their haunting, mystic quality.    But where Lord of the Rings has a little too much of children's literature in it, this one - despite the presence of \\"elves\\" and such - is for grownups alone. Its intellectual level, and the quality and density of the prose, are too high for children. And for dummies, or the spiritually bankrupt. This is Tolkien's best and most elite statement, a true classic of 20th century literature.    I'll pay this book the best compliment I know and say that it is the single best Lord Dunsany imitation I have ever seen, but it is also much more than that. Tolkien's prose soars to the majestic heights that his inventions warrant. Nothing against his other books, but many elements of them are a matter of taste whereas the greatness of the Silmarillion cannot be seriously denied by anyone with a brain or a soul. Not to be missed.	2004-07-15

The truth is so simple, and yet seems so fantastic that you might hesitate to believe it. Along with E. R. Eddison, he is the best writer of fantasy that there ever was, or likely ever shall be (the same could be said of Dunsany as a short story writer in general, and must be, because we are here to tell the truth for a change). Tolkien, for example, is nothing but a pale shadow cast by the sun that is Dunsany; Lovecraft was a rather silly-seeming imitation. Once you have drunk from this well nothing else even comes close; it will almost ruin you for other writers. The question is, if he is just the deepest, saddest, funniest, most clever, most beautiful, and again excepting only Eddison the flat-out best writer of any kind the latter-day Western world has produced -- and he is, brothers and sisters, he IS -- why doesn't everyone know about it? Why has he fallen into obscurity?     The reason is simple and obvious. Look around you. The world has gone mad. We have lost all connection to the real. And this great man, this Lord Dunsany, saw it, saw it before almost anyone, saw it happening all around him. And he went out and wrote stories about it, stories that are the least real things ever created on the surface -- but touch the very highest levels of reality in their deeper parts. It is just those parts that are invisible or despised in our mad world, and that is why he is hated, ignored, forgotten -- by all but a few, a few who can peer through those veils of madness. Dunsany's work is not escapism. It is literature, literature of the highest order; literature of an exponentially higher order than any of the garbage pushed down our throats by the academics and pseudointellecutal humanities majors whose task it is to maintain this madhouse of a world -- you know, the kinds of people who despise Lord of the Rings and talk themselves into believing that deviant, culture-destroying nut cases such as James Joyce are great writers.    Brothers and sisters, you have found the source of that which you have so long sought. This book, all his best books, are a door into another world, a saner and better world, a world within you waiting to be discovered. Buy this book. Buy all of Dunsany's short story collections, especially the early ones. They will haunt your dreams forever and if you let them, they might even change your life, all without your noticing quite how, why, or when.	2004-06-19

The technique is simple, invented by Joyce and imitated here by Pynchon: adopt an arcane, stream of consciousness prose style; thereby inflate a thousand word idea into a few hundred thousand words; and in the end say nothing at all worth saying. A bunch of pseudointellectual pretenders will proceed to lap this up, in order to build up their self-images by being able to brag about reading such a thing (note the long, dense, verbose reviews this doorstop gets). Well, let me tell you something, smart people. IQ tests are a valid, if approximate, measure of intelligence, which is indeed a real quantity, as demonstrated by the fact, among others, that it is highly correlated to physical characteristics such as reaction time. Reading books won't make you any smarter, you're born with it. I personally have a verbal IQ somewhere over 160. In other words, I'm smart enough that I don't have to give a damn about impressing anybody by saying I've read some silly overblown excuse for a book, even though I did read Gravity's Rainbow, to my lasting regret. I'm smart enough that I don't have even a little trouble understanding a trifle like Pynchon's \\"masterpiece\\", nor did I when I first read it at age 16. Here's the scoop: this is trash, Pynchon is a mountebank, and all the people whose praise has earned this thing a \\"classic\\" distinction need to read some real classics, so they will be able to identify the species in the future. And the fact that you types will perceive me as an arrogant philistine for saying so is only you projecting your own psychological disease on me, or anybody who disagrees with you - which is why the kinds of people who like this kind of junk, or Picasso, or Joyce, or Piet Mondrian, or any other similar hoax perpetrated by modern art, are so impossible to convince of its utterly specious quality, as in the Emperor's New Clothes. Western civilization has been in serious decline for a century or so; Thomas Pynchon and his kind are only the odor wafting off the decomposing corpse, and the people who actually manage to convince themselves that they enjoy this stench are beyond redemption.	2004-03-15

Books	5	14	20	N	N	from a shuriken point of view	The writing and the illustrations in this book are a matter of taste. Some like them, some don't. You have to take some of the negative comments with a grain of salt because it is always the ones that don't have the patience or talent to learn something that will blame the teacher. But Ralph Thorn is still a somewhat controversial figure and the way this is presented is sometimes a little over the top. But what can't be argued about are the facts. Having seen both the book and the video by Ralph Thorn and knowing something about shuriken, I can give some facts.    The grip he calls the \\"overhand\\" grip is a Japanese shuriken grip. If he knew this, he didn't mention it. What he calls the \\"spear style\\" throw in the book and the \\"spinless\\" throw in the dvd are technically a quarter-spin throw. Japanese shuriken masters have been doing this type of throwing for hundreds of years. It is wrong to say that it is limited to short range only. The masters have hit throws of fifty or sixty feet with a quarter spin. There are videos on the internet of people hitting long throws in this style (including some by Thorn). He doesn't throw that far, but he throws bigger knives than shuriken throwers and hits from at least half that far. He does have a technique for hitting seventy foot throws but it isn't the spinless throw.    It's true that he has very impressive compact power and that he can throw a lot of different weapons, but shuriken masters can also do these things. What gives him a claim to doing something new is basically the fact that he is able to throw from a lot more angles than traditional shuriken throwers. For example, he throws over his shoulder or around his back, blindfolded, without looking. He claims to be able to throw a knife pretty much the same way you can throw a ball in his book, and that appears to be the case (though not as far). He does this by using his wrist in a different way. That is his main innovation and the main reason his \\"new approach\\" is very interesting to martial artists. He is able to hit consectutive throws from all different attack angles very easily. In real hand to hand combat this style of throwing would reign supreme. It is  more practical than traditional shuriken and far beyond the circus type of knife throwing.    If you can only get one the video is better but the book has a lot of in depth information on fighting that the video doesn't have.	2004-02-24

Vance is the greatest prose stylist in the history of genre fiction, heck, maybe in the history of fiction. Lyonesse is funny, sad, arch, inventive, adventurous, philosophical, page-turning, perfect. The characters are more real than any of the people you know, and you will love and hate them more than your own friends and enemies. The Elder Isles are more real than New York or London and much more interesting. You should get every book in this series (there are three) immediately, no matter what the financial or personal costs, and immediately make them the centerpiece of your life until you have read them all.

The author places the &quot;gifted&quot; cutoff line at the 95th percentile -- which is just too low. There's no way one in twenty people could be described as &quot;gifted&quot;. Also, she describes the characteristics of people who conform to social expectations, the kind who never invent or think anything new as exhibiting giftedness, merely because of academic or professional accomplishments. First, people like that aren't &quot;gifted&quot;; second, they don't need books written about their condition.Now, the good: she doesn't subscribe to the idea that mere IQ tests are the sole measure of giftedness, but presents an interesting body of traits that make up the &quot;syndrome&quot;.

Schwaller de Lubicz proves countless points about ancient Egypt's level of philosophical, cultural and mathematical sophistication that eliminate conventional ideas about history as likely or even possible. It's too bad this work doesn't reach the audience it deserves. Less compelling is the fact that the bulk of his work, including this book, is nothing but his own medieval, alchemical philosophy projected onto the Egyptians. His ideas are interesting on an intellectual level, but not to be taken literally, and they won't exactly lead you to the &quot;philospher's stone&quot;. Unlike de Lubicz's measurements or his observation of water erosion on the Sphinx, which we can reproduce, his interpretations of the meaning of the heiroglyphs are entirely subjective and spring from his own prejudices.

That's not hyperbole. There's a reason why it stays in print. Ouspensky was smarter than Einstein (and understood time better) and more enlightened than Gurdjieff, no matter what anybody says.

And this is indeed a classic.    With that said, it is a classic despite its author, not because of him. It is great because of its subject. It becomes clear by the end of the narrative that the author cannot understand what is best and highest in Schwaller, for that is what he rejects, whereas he embraces what is least (the alchemical and Egyptological superstitions in which Schwaller disguises his own insights). The writer is a minor figure who was, rather incredibly, programmed like a robot by Schwaller (he would use the term \\"inscribed\\") to perform the function of making his great works accessible to a wider public.

The case for that is all circumstantial, but it is an overwhelming circumstantial case, and if historians ever get a clue the existence of so-called \\"Atlantis\\" will be taken for granted.    Nor do I dispute the basic truth of Schwaller's esoteric worldview.    What I dispute is the idea that the temple at Luxor has anything to do with what Schwaller says it does.

But even in the early days the cracks were starting to appear--every third sentence, it seemed, was a quotation of some authority;, a hint of things to come. Wilber rapidly deteriorated into a topheavy, overly mental type who does nothing but manipulate words and concepts, the furthest thing from mysticism; worse, he is a devotee of Aurobindo and Chardin, who are the most devious distortions of perennialism out there. And finally, with Boomeritis, he is revealed as just another academic philosopher, the kind who spends his time defending some little intellectual territory he has staked out for himself. (This book, by the way, is not a novel at all; Wilber lacks the skill or creativity to do that kind of writing.) Boomeritis is just an excuse to launch vainglorious attacks on everyone and everything Wilber doesn't like or understand.

Books	5	25	34	N	N	back cover blurb	Conventional wisdom among knife-fighting experts has it that knife throwing is a pursuit best left to circus performers, hillbilly theme parks, and hobbyists and that it is useless for combat or other survival purposes. In this ground-breaking new book, Ralph Thorn differentiates between &quot;circus&quot; knife throwing and combat knife throwing, and reveals his style of knife throwing suitable for actual combat and knife fights.<BR>   The author, who has practiced his craft for decades, begins by showing you how to balance a knife for throwing -- and how to make your own throwing knives out of readily available materials. He shows you how to build targets (and what makes the best targets), and how to practice the various combat throwing techniques, with an emphasis on both safety and practicality. Ralph Thorn demonstrates the overhand, underhand, and sidearm throws, and discusses the situations where each style works best.<BR>   &quot;One way of expressing the essential difference between circus-style and spear-style throwing is to say that in the former you try to make every throw as similar as possible and in the latter you can and should treat every throw differently. Circus-style throwing is a game of dexterity that requires a single, very specific skill; in this it is much like bowling or billiards. Spear-style throwing can be like this if you want to stand still and throw for accuracy alone, but it can also become a freestyle sport, more like martial arts or skateboarding than like circus throwing. And, of course, it can be used for self defense.&quot; A truly path-breaking book, Combat Knife Throwing should be read by every sportsman, knife aficionado, and anyone interested in self defense.	2002-08-23

There is a fundamental theme running like a red thread throughout these stories, and it is this: man is an animal only weakened by civilization, and the closer one is to the natural state the more effective one is in the real world. Howard expresses this not only with his characters and situations, which are ten times more imaginative than anything you'll find in contemporary literature, but with his breathless, literate prose, which manages to be elegant and brutal at the same time. This man largely writes about the same kinds of things Hemingway wrote about, only with vastly more inspiration and originality, and it's a shame that the excuses for fantasy writers of the present and their Dungeons and Dragons-weaned fans let superior work like this languish while heaping dollars and praise on tenth-generation copies of Tolkien.	2002-05-23

This is a complete presentation of the lives of G. and O., drawing the only conclusion possible: G's ideas are a brilliant but derivative hash made out of a random assortment of old occult documents and a little bit of hearsay. But the book says all this with  a remarkable grace, depth and style; this man knows what he is talking about and knows how to say it. Rare in this genre.	2002-05-09

For all his brilliance, even in old age G. was very crafty, manipulative and superstitious, as revealed here (he thought the caves at Lascaux were painted by Atlanteans!).

(This series picks up where Eclipse left off). I was hooked from the start. With the sole possible exception of the works of Jim Woodring, Krazy is the apex of comics and equal to anything in twentieth century art in any form. How much that was taken seriously by the \\"intellectuals\\" of its day remains on our radar screen now? And yet Krazy is with us still. This particular collection is from the prime of the strip, the black-and-white era before Herriman's line got a little fat and his strips a little abstruse. The sole flaw this book has is its too-cute graphic design; for some reason the cover images are upside-down, and the lettering is all pseudo-old-fashioned. I guess that's what passes for creativity today. The content, of course, needs no such silly devices to prop it up; even after seventy plus years every single strip is as fresh as a daisy.Here's to seventy more.	2002-04-12

Intrigued, I searched down several of his source documents and, while they did not exactly disprove his model, it became clear that his castle was build on a foundation of shifing sands. Undaunted, I still thought it at least valuable as metaphor. Then, I read this one--his diary--and saw what all these grandiose, self-referential beliefs had done to their author, and I came to understand that in fact, Wilber's works do more harm than good. Wilber, as many have noted, is self-absorbed with his ideas to the point of delusion, and it has made him  unreasonably defensive towards his many attackers. His followers do the same, and are showing all the signs of becoming an intellectual cult of the Ayn Rand or Sartre variety. I have read hundreds of spritual biographies, and if there is a pattern, it is that those who say you can only teach yourself are invariably humble, and those who are dedicated to topheavy systems (like Wilber's) always tell you that you need a teacher (the creator of the system, of course), and always degenerate into just this kind of madness. If this peek into Wilber's true nature doesn't make you think twice, you need to examine your own motivations in projecting wisdom onto a man who is merely a fluent writer indulging himself in a single theme, his own genius.	2001-08-20

This was a mistake. Wolinsky has nothing new to add to the enneagram, and his &quot;chaos&quot; approach to psychology has nothing to do with chaos science, which he readily admits he does't understand at all--he simply uses it as a marketing tool, one he has, incredibly, copyrighted. This looney book might serve as a useful introduction to the basic typological descriptions, but if you're already familiar with them, skip it. Unless, of course, you're one of the millions who finds foggy, feelgood psychobabble of the kind K. Wilber, D. Chopra, L.

In fact, much like the splatter-painting of  Jackson Pollock, or the black-on-black canvases of Ad Reinhardt, or the silent compositions of  John Cage, or the cut-ups of Wm. Burroughs or the pop lyrics of Bob Dylan, Ulysses has no real meaning at all--and that is its secret to success. When an artist has something important to say, he (or she) expresses himself with as much clarity as possible, just as a person who is shouting &quot;fire&quot; or &quot;wake up&quot; would. When he has little or nothing to say, he writes or paints or plays either right-brain stream-of-consciousness gobbledygook and calls it &quot;metaphor&quot; or &quot;exploring the unconscious&quot;, or presents minimalist nothing at all and calls it &quot;conceptual&quot;. He can then sit back for decades and watch the pseudointellectuals and  tenured humanities professors invent endless meanings where there are none, whereas books that contain any clarity will slip into obscurity, since their meanings are obvious and leave the masters (and doctors) of hot air nothing to debate. Ulyssess is the all-time champion of this sort of thing; while many of modern art's similar hoaxes have long since been relegated to the proverbial dustbin, Joyce's obvious genius for manipulating words keeps this thing at the top of the charts among those influenced by academic pretense. The fact that those words are all surface and communciate not one idea of any significance to anyone is a something of a shame for serious people (who might waste time seeking them here, due to its reputation), but an absolute goldmine for the people who like to write glorified term papers about this glorified crossword puzzle and its like.  At least the more general reading public has never been swayed by such frauds, preferring mere entertainments like Lord of the Rings--which indeed have more going for them, on any level, than anything Joyce and his kind have ever done.	2001-07-28

From this, I draw the conclusion that its author is either borderline crazy, or the same kind of huckster Gurdjieff was. Or both.    I take Gurdjieff at his word, when he obliquely describes himself (in his pseudo-autobiography) as a sort of sincere con man, and when he says that he was only a part of a group that put together his ideas. That is because I have known guys just like him -- hick preachers, mostly. Most of them act just like the \\"master\\" Gurdjieff and many of them even look like him (types are quite real, as G. himself always said). Basically sincere, good-hearted guys who sort-of believe in what they preach, but who have the same set of deep weaknesses, a need to spend a lot of money and live off of other people while manipulating them. They are always hypocrites, they always like whiskey and women and dirty jokes and gambling and con games of any kind, and they always have about fifteen different businesses going at once, none of them entirely legitimate. Guys like Gurdjieff don't have the intellectual discipline to put together the kind of system he taught (and which G. himself communicated with only a little coherence), and they are not readers or writers of any quality, but they are great oral learners and great speakers. They have to be, to be the awesome hucksters they are. And if you get to know them, they will usually even admit they are hucksters, as Gurdjieff did, to anyone with the sense to pay attention. They tend to be quite likable people and aware of their failings.    It is unfortunate for the Pattersons of the world (who, if they only knew, define the \\"sleep\\" that the Gurdjieffs of the world like to rub in their faces even as they pick their pockets) that they don't understand this type of good-natured con artist, or they wouldn't waste their lives believing they are \\"teachers\\". It is quite telling that all of Gurdjieff's main disciples, then and now, are urban pseudointellectual types who have never encountered these charismatic religious con artists from the wrong side of the tracks; they are perfect victims. Where I grew up, you can turn over any rock and a couple of them will crawl out. I have seen a dozen of these phony little preacher-men and believe me, they are all alike. Gurdjieff did just what they all do, preached a lot of things he got from some other place and only barely understood himself. The only difference between him and the hick preachers carousing on weeknights is this: Gurdjieff actually had access to people with real insight and real ideas. Ouspensky figured him out: a tainted source from a true school, or schools.    Instead of wasting time on Patterson's earnest true-believer tomes, you might instead seek out Ouspensky's books, especially the ones written before he met Gurdjieff. The language of mysticism is, everywhere and everywhen, geometry. Gurdjieff's core work, the enneagram, is a nice little semi-lucid footnote to Pythagoreanism, but Ouspensky's work on the fourth dimension is truly groundbreaking and still the cutting edge of thought in esoteric geometry. I'll take Ouspensky's Tertium Organum and New Model of the Universe over everything the entire Gurdjieff work has to offer, and I think most real thinkers would as well.	2001-07-27

For nearly a thousand pages it reads like fiction, but only a few parts--the ones where Crowley tries to claim supernatural intervention and thus prove the validity of his  mostly silly made-up religion--are obvious inventions, and even those are perhaps believed by their author. This is, beyond a doubt, the singularly most entertaining book I have ever encountered, and even contains some small bits of wisdom. Don't pay any attention to those who say Crowley can't write; his poetry is nearly as bad as you've heard, but he is a genius at prose. Even the gargantuan amounts of drugs he was taking as he wrote this don't detract a whit from his amazing wit, clarity of thought and vividness of perception. This book contains very little that is vulgar, violent or obscene (despite the author's reputation) and is appropriate for young and old alike, as each will take from it it only what they are capable of giving.	2001-07-27

Ken Wilber has been writing the same book over and over and over for twenty-five years. All he ever does, and he does it here yet again, is stuff more data into his particular filing-cabinet model of reality. He often uses the editorial &quot;we&quot; when talking about these &quot;researches&quot;, which he and his supporters claim is not merely his own subjectivly assembled grab-bag of others' ideas of the kind countless similar new-agers have put together over the years, but a real, objective, working model of reality. If this is the case, then surely Mr. Wilber can provide us with something resembling  a testable, provable hypothesis or two, so that we might confirm or invalidate his claims. Until he does so he will continue to attract a gullible following of easily impressed people looking for something, anything, to believe in. To further free them from having to think for themselves, he can continue to make a series of totally unsupported claims, most all of them taken not from his direct experience (internal or otherwise), but from books written by screwballs like Bubba Free John, and banish to &quot;flatland&quot; anyone who dares to call him on it. But it isn't just the spiritually empty culture of academic psychology that remains unimpressed with Wilber's work because of such tactics; there are those just as familiar with the most of the territories he covers who find him far less than a spiritual genius, and his model far less than &quot;inclusive&quot;.	2001-07-27

The main complaint I have with this book is that he doesn't cover other, similar frauds like Shah and Almaas in any detail, and that Patterson is pulling his punches. He is too hesitant to outright label the enneagram shysters (some of whom actually have copyrights on the terminology in \\"thier\\" stolen systems) and deviant cult leaders found here for what he must know they are. If only all those new-age zombies like Ken Wilber and the enneagram fans had a copy of this book, maybe they wouldn't make such fools of themselves in public by prostrating themselves before a few western psychologists marketed with watered-down and  often entirely made-up versions of Sufism and the Gurdjieff legacy. Maybe.    Of course, the biggest thief and con artist of them all was Gurdjieff himself, but that's another story...	2001-07-25

No other book that I am aware of contains so much information on the man or such insight into his personality, which turns out, not surprisingly, to be inherently secretive and almost pathologically deceptive.

If the Greeks stole their culture from anywhere, and I am not sure they did, it was Egypt; and if the Egyptians stole it, it was probably from Northern Europe (there are stones representing the \\"Platonic\\" solids from Scotland, older by far than the pyramids, as is Stonehenge; and check out Jurgen Spanuth for the history of the invasion of Greece from the North that started the first Greek dark age).<br />In retrospect this is his best book; certainly the only one in which he actually tries to make a case for what he writes.

His tone here is of great importance; it is one of matter-of-fact self-ridicule and self-disclosure; and given the author's reputation for literal honesty, we might even be able to believe that a quarter of what he writes here actually happened. A good batting average indeed for his type of \\"teacher\\".    You see, I take Gurdjieff at his word, when he basically describes himself as a sort of sincere con man, and when he says that he was only a part of a group that put together his ideas.

Guys like Gurdjieff don't have the intellectual discipline to put together the kind of system he taught (and which G. himself communicated with only a little coherence), and they are not readers or writers of any quality, but they are great oral learners and great speakers. This is the most conversational of G.'s books, and the most readable. It is the only one worth having.    Ignore the rest of his stuff; it's for the sheep that still believe in him. You might instead seek out Ouspensky's books, especially the ones written before he met Gurdjieff. Gurdjieff was a hundred miles wide and one foot deep; all of his ideas can be found in far superior form in other places (Sheldon, and Rodney Collin, do types better; any world religion does the creation myth better; Krishnamurti does awareness better; biology does the cycle of life better; Schwaller de Lubicz and his disciples do ancient history, Egypt and Pythagorean number mysticism better; the list goes on...) Ouspensky, on the other hand, was about a foot wide, but a hundred miles deep. His work on time far outstrips Gurdjieff, as G. himself practically admitted, and still has great value. Gurdjieff's only remaining value is to hustlers and true believers.	2001-05-31

No one seems to respond to this book, or any of his other novels, simply as works of fiction, and it is fortunate for him that they do not. Like the rest, this novel is populated by cliched, cardboard cutout characters spouting dialogue so unnatural that even a TV sitcom rings more true; in addition it is weighed down not only by its phony, derivative plot but by an appendix full of cross-referenced subplots that do nothing to advance the story but do much to advance Wilson's and Shea's self-promotion as masters of occult and conspiratorial information. The latter, maybe; the former, never. Wilson cannot understand religion, occultism or mysticism on any but the shallowest level, and his dedication to escapism makes sure that it will stay that way.

Wilson ( some of those who believe the destructive, egomaniacal, blood and dope drinking Crowley to be the avatar of the century at least and of all history at most) and similar occult/psychology true belivers while steering clear of the opposite cliff, the naive dismissals of Symonds, Hutchinson, Colin Wilson and the kinds of hacks who write entries for those ridiculous encycopedias of the supernatural. This book is a thankless labor of love by a writer whose talents are exactly suited for it and should be the first and last stop for all those with a casual interest in the life of that erraticly brilliant, ultimately repugnant clown of spirituality, Aleister Crowley.	2001-05-29

For a non-mystic to write about Gurdjieff, Blavatsky or Krishnamurti is like someone writing a book about Einstein without bothering to learn anything about all that stuff about physics, or for someone tone-deaf from birth to do a bio of Beethoven. Nevertheless, anyone interested in the above biographical figures needs to check this out. His deconstruction of some of the worst of these idiots, like the Theosophists or Bennett, is delicious, though he doesn't understand the positives in the works of the two sanest figures he writes about (Krishnamurti and Ouspensky, both great thinkers with weaknesses).	2001-05-29

These books are packed with fun science facts that will fascinate readers of all ages and, even better, they are presented in a very entertaining fictional format. All your favorite characters from the original serial are back: Enki, Ninti, the villainous Enlil, and, of course (!), those zany Annunaki from Nibiru. Why no one has nominated Sitchin for the Caldicott award is beyond me. Or maybe a Pulitzer.	2001-05-29

If you can wade through the occasional mudhole of that sort of thing (and who among us interested in so-called spiritual literature hasn't had to learn to do so), his humility, common sense and basic decency shine through in every page of these five volumes. It is this that gives him his often penetrating insight into human nature; the fourth way conceptual system he frames it in is ultimately only a hindrance. While he owes much to The System as a writer, where he succeeds as a mystic he succeeds despite it, not because of it.	2001-05-24

Krishnamurti over decades of public speaking, and uses them to great effect. Once the truth of this teaching is realized, there is no longer any possibility of reliance on &quot;concepts&quot; of any kind, but paradoxically this realization must be expressed in words and therefore concepts if we are to communicate it; and if someone else (such as K) has clearly defined some ways to do so, there is nothing wrong in borrowing them. Harrison doesn't allow us to make the mistake of imagining that these conceptualizations are anything more than the finger pointing at the moon; it is the moon that is continually emphasized here. It is probably rare for someone who has arrived at this place to bother to write at all. We are fortunate that Harrison has.	2001-05-15

He still sloppily repeats lurid anecdotes that are denied in most sources (I found outright errors of fact in each of the first four biographical stories I read, and they are only a few pages long), he still gullibly believes in any supernatural nonsense that he sees in print (as long as it fits into his long-ago-determined and set in stone worldview), and he still offers up the very same mediocre interpretations and glib dismissals of anything he cannot understand (Zen) that he did thirty years ago. On the bright side, he still writes some of the smoothest, most readable nonfiction prose in existence, and still strives to be as complete as possible in any subject he touches. The result of all this is that his books are a thousand miles wide and one inch deep. If you're looking for a readable collection of the bios of weird cult leaders, look no further--the book would get five stars as a collection of printed data. If you want detailed, reliable research or penetrating, unbiased analysis, then ignore this, or most anything Wilson has written; on these counts the book gets a zero, since Wilson is merely a gifted collector and repackager of  others' data who unfortunately clutters his books with superficial wiseacreing when he imagines that he is some kind of mystic or thinker.	2001-05-13

It is simply classic. Based on nothing but a blurry photo of the Martian landscape, the author invents a complex belief system involving imaginary mathematical connections between hills he and a few others imagine to be pyramids and sphinxes and their counterparts on Earth, delusional pseudoscientific cosmologies involving the &quot;four-dimensional&quot; aspects of planetary formation, and so on and on, in moonfire profusion. There is hardly any doubt that he believes it himself; he is so attached to and identified with this little wish-fulfilling descent into neurosis that even when higher-resolution versions of the so-called face on Mars quite clearly reveal it to be nothing by a couple of hills casting shadows, he determines that the face is instead half-human and half-lion. So great is his investment in this fairy tale that we might wonder if he would concede defeat even if NASA sent him to the red planet's surface to see for himself that there is, in fact, nothing to see.	2001-05-13

These Commentaries are, along with his journals and notebook, the only major works in print (at least that I am aware of, and I am aware of most) that he actually wrote himself; the rest of his books are, of course, compilations of talks and conversations. If you like Krishnamurti and you can get past his constant arrogant belittling of traditional religions, which he knows nothing about, you need these.	2001-05-10

My candidate is Sitchin. You will learn infinitely more from any chapter in these books than in everything Tolkien ever wrote combined; and while the first Dune book is great, the sequels are mediocre and break no new ground. Breaking new ground is Sitchin's middle name. His narrative style is bewitching; he ingeniously presents his works in a linear, essay-like format, but each chapter in the serial clearly further expands and develops the plot, always in unexpected new directions. Like every good sci-fi writer, he knows how to disguise the holes in his science (such as the fact that nothing resembling humanoid life could possible exist on a planet with an orbit that would take it so far from the sun's light, if not heat) by anticipating the reader's questions, and then defusing them with glib explanations that avoid the real issues. This maintains the suspension of disbelief so necessary to good fiction, especially in this genre. And I, for one, have no problem with his marketing these books as &quot;fact&quot;; they contain no more speculation that the kinds of &quot;responsible&quot; stuff the university types publish, and, like Carlos Castaneda's great works, the painted covers and context clues clearly indicate that these are works of the imagination. Sitchin, in fact, may have a literary imagination equal to any man alive.	2001-05-03

Many of Wilber's ideas, here in Brief History of Everything and all of his later works, are lifted directly from \\"Master\\" Da, right down to the terminology, but he hardly stops there: he simultaneously manages to believe in literal Hindu-style reincarnation, Freudianism, Zen Buddhism, behaviourism, and any number of other things, dodging their inherent contradictions by taking only what he wants of each.     His system is little more than a lot of decoration disguising a stitching-together of Freud and Piaget with Da and Aurobindo; correspondences to what he here and in later works calls \\"other quadrants\\" are always suggested but never specified. Similarly, his supposedly \\"inclusive\\" model simply ignores vast areas of the world religious traditions that contradict his theory, such as all of Western esotericism and the nearly universal idea that the proper number of levels of consciousness (his primary theme) is seven.     That the seams in this crazy quilt are seemingly invisible to so many is due in part to the overspecialized (mis)education we are provided with; most of Wilber's readers probably aren't familiar enough with the vast territories he covers to realize that he subtly distorts all he touches to shoehorn it into his model. He comes across here and elsewhere as a self-assured filing cabinet stuffed full of data; but he never provides us with a single testable hypothesis, only a belief system consisting of a vague doctrine of inevitable progress. It is this in particular that makes his system so appealing to the academics, corporate CEOs and limosine new-agers that endorse it; it reinforces all their most cherishedillusions. This is not to say that his books are without merit; his observations are spot-on when he isn't defending his precious system, and he builds a sort of holistic verbal bridge to places the intellectually or spiritually lazy will find new, but for those serious about transformation it is a bridge to nowhere.	2001-05-02

Ichazo pieced together a method of labeling people that seems to be mostly distilled from fragments published by the followers of Gurdjieff and hung them around the nine-sided visual symbol; the even more fraudulent Naranjo then modifed them according to modern western psychological disorders (the similarity, especially to the DSM categories, is obvious); then a gaggle of gullible new-agers, most of whom know little enough about western psychology and are not even capable of understanding Gurdjieff, believed all the unsupported nonsense about this coming from ancient Sufis. Nevertheless, you can indeed learn something about personality types by reading the Riso version of these books; just take all this with a mine of salt and avoid the more glassy-eyed versions such as Palmer's.	2001-04-20

Perhaps he realized that any systematic approach to developing our consciousness is impossible, since if we are on a road with a known destination that destination can only be our own projection of what we imagine it to be. No matter. The ability of this man Ouspensky to think systematically was indeed his great strength, and it lent all his writing a clarity and throughness simply unmatched in all of twentieth century \\"occultism\\". Nowhere did he need it more than in this reporting of the early teachings of Gurdjieff, when that particular unique idiot was at the zenith of his own development. Ouspensky alone could have made these ideas, brought to Europe in a nearly incoherent form by the deviant rascal Gurdjieff, into something useful, if ultimately only on the level of a warning. This book exists at the boundary line between the place where words are at their limit and the place Ouspensky may have finally reached, where words can never go. And rest assured that Ouspensky nevertheless communicates almost through osmosis some of these things much better than this abstruse little review can.	2001-04-18
