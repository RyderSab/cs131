I have yet to encounter any problems in reading this series... for some the repetition is &quot;boring&quot;, or &quot;needless&quot;, however I often find it often times helpful.  True there are some things which I have no problem remembering, and there are others that once reminded-- the event or person will 'click' in my memory and it's like &quot;Oh yeah!&quot;  I'm not reading these one after another, often times I have two or three other novels in between, so repetative descriptions are good.<br />Now I wish I could look Mr. Jordan in the eyes and ask... &quot;So what in the bloody Pit of Doom were you thinking leaving us hanging about Mat like that?  And what about Sammael?&quot;<br />Arrg... too many open ends!  Maybe this time I'll go ahead and pick up book eight right away!	2003-07-13

This very intense addition to the Wheel of Time series has a huge amount of plot furthering, sub-plot creating and furthering, surprises and twists, and everything you should expect after reading any of Jordan's books.  Things happen to characters that are so unexpected I had to re-read the paragraphs involved!<br />Other twists and turns include (without spoiling it for anyone) the return of people thought long gone, new love twists, a gathering (however breif) of the ta'veren-- sorry, I know that's a little spoiler-- and much more.  People who have donned this as a &quot;just another filler&quot;, in my opinion probably did not make it to the end.  In my opinion, none of the series so far has been boring, or needless.  Jordan weaves his craft as handly as an Aes Sedai weaves the One Power, and I'm cracking open book seven as soon as I finish this review.  Enjoy the novel!	2003-06-28
US	51261336	R121HUP22UD8MA	0743211383	241269653	Dreamcatcher	Books	5	3	3	N	N	Another King triumph!	While it's true that Mr. King's pain is evident throughout this book, at least he even admits to it!  The theme... typical King that fans have come to expect... the language and attitude, well hey-- he was recovering from that bad accident, its only common sense to have it come forth into the novel.<br />Dreamcatcher is the story of 4 boys tied somehow to a 5th, a great friend named Duddits, even after years of absence away from eachother they still have a connecting bond.  One hunting season, on the yearly hunting trip to Hole in the Wall, Henry, Jonesy, Beaver, (oops, I forgot the other one's name :~) has their world turned upside down as something has come not of this world.  At first, no one knows exactly what IT is... the signs point to feverish hysteria in one case, and then some awful disease instead... then come the flashlights.  Lights in the sky start to appear, animals flock together to seemingly escape something, electronics go haywire... what in the world is happening?  <br />All of these things come together and explain just what is happening... and I won't tell.  I will admit that the book does get slow for a few chapters... but at about chapter 10 or 11, get reaady to hold on to your coffee cups and keep them full.  Page after page will start to turn, weariness will be fought as you struggle to stay awake to find out what happens.  Enjoy, and Mr. King... one heck of a job in Dreamcatcher, thank you.	2003-02-16

True there are years to skip and years for other authors to fill in, but hey if every book moved the line forward there'd be too many problems!  I won't give anything away here, so I'll just state that if you haven't read 'Second Generation' do so first, it'll get you familiar with the characters here, then after this get started on the novels with 'the Chaos Wars' in them (ie. Tears of the Night Sky, etc.)then go to the 'Bridges of Time' series, and then the 'Dragons of a New Age' series will lead you right up to the 'War of Souls' trilogy.

However I was recommended books by R.A.Salvatore, and my interest in the Realms was piqued.  I figured I had better start with this novel to get really familiar with the Realms and Elminster, and I was surprised at the page turning ability this novel created.<br />From his start as a prince, to a thief, to a woman priestess, to a man again and an apprentice, this novel had it all.<BR>All I will say is enjoy!	2003-02-07

This is one of the best written DL books around.  Mr. Pierson has a very good grasp on keeping his readers wanting more.  His battle scenes are well thought out (and acted), his characters never lose who they are (ie. they never act like anyone else, they stay true to form), and its always nice to revisit some old friends and make some new ones too!<br />Riverwind was not Kendermore's first choice of heroes but as Paxina states &quot;You'll do!&quot;  The red dragon Malystryx is out for conquest, and she enlists the Ogres to help pave her way.  Little by the little Malys' magic changes the land around her, and here Kendermore and Kenderwood are her targets.  How does an aging Hero of the Lance deal with this mess?

This volume of the DL saga has tas, Flint, and Tanis meeting for the first time... and what stories they will have afterwards!<br />Flint is approached by a mysterious woman who would like him to craft a bracelet for her.  She has very specific instructions (we find out later) as to how this is to be crafted.  Needless to say that Tas enters the picture and winds up beginning the quest of a lifetime for Flint and Tanis.  <br />\\"Creatures\\" that (to my knowledge) haven't shown up before in DL novels come into play here... especially the firey-winged humanoids, there's an appearance of a hill giant, golems in the form of minotaurs, and we get to know a little of the Sea Elves.<BR>Magic is abundant in this novel, but the action in no way seems hampered by the lack of hack and slash (apparent in most DL).  Tas is however more 'crafty' and 'take charge' than I'm used to, though... but he's still portrayed quite well.<br />All in all, if you like the Heroes of the Lance, or if you're interested in starting Dragonlance (heck, if you're in the mood for a good fantasy)then pick this one up... but remember to get Part 1 of Meetings too.	2002-11-18

The character Roland isn't developed like King's other characters, he seems to try and grow without letting the readers have a foundation.  I've started book two, and can say honestly that King's growth as an author is evident.	2002-11-08
US	51261336	R1CPM5I24V81B3	0670855030	179012025	Insomnia	Books	5	2	3	N	N	Wonderful story!	First off, when deciding whether or not to purchase this novel, keep two things in mind... this is not the all out &quot;horror&quot; we're so used to from King, this is more of a thriller.  Secondly, this novel has a serious tie-in to his Dark Tower series.  Even if one has not read the Dark Tower novels, the reader could still enjoy this.<BR>Now, this novel starts off much like 'The Stand' does, in the aspect of very slow start, yet once the action kicks in it's non-stop!<br />Ralph Roberts starts off with bad luck, his wife is mis-diagnosed by the family doctor and Ralph soon hears the &quot;deathwatch&quot; ticking his beloved's life away.  Shortly thereafter, Ralph develops a form of insomnia, then that graduates and he can live in what others refer to as hyper-reality (seeing the auras of others).  Then come the little bald doctors... and Ralph's world is turned completely upside down...<br />This novel has a serious side to it, King discusses the ever present abortion issue, and the effects that it (the issue and one's feelings) would have on a town, where everyone knows everyone (or so it seems).  As this town's residents are split between pro-life and pro-choice, the reader also becomes involved; 'Where do I stand?' he/she might ask to the wind.  <BR>The magic that King wields here is unreal, from his character development (that the reader can easily love or hate), to his description of the town... one can see every inch of Derry.  The sights, sounds, even the smells in that town become alive in the reader's imagination.<br />Bottom line... a King fan will love it, a non-King fan will cross-over, lol.  Enjoy.	2002-11-04

Some questions are answered, yet others quickly become asked.

This time the Companions of the Hall venture into Mithril Hall... long lost home of Clan Battlehammer.  On there trail, however, are a mage, a golem, and an assassin (the only one of the three that is known to any of the Companions).  Regis has not told the true reason for his joining of this quest, for it is the assassin that seeks him and his pendant.<BR>     Unlike the first novel, this seems to be more...patient/perhaps thought out... for lack of better terms.  In the first, everything seemed rushed, here though everything is paced.  The battles are drawn out more vividly, the obstacles seem tougher to endure, even the jokes and sarcasm seem 'real'.  Salvatore has either matured in his writing, or gained the respect of his editors/publishers ( a little of both to be sure), and both show in this 'Chapter' of the Icewind Dale trilogy.  A must read for fans of Salvatore, and any of the characters in the book... I still don't know what the big deal is with all the Drizzt fans, though.  I've started to grow fond of Bruenor and Wulfgar as characters.  Oh well, enjoy!	2002-10-12

This is a decent start to a promising trilogy, although this seems to be a very early start in Salvatore's career (his writing improves greatly during 'Streams of Silver').  The main problem in this novel... the battles have too rushed a feeling to them.  How does Drizzt seem to escape battle after battle, etc. with hardly any wounds at all?<BR>How can any character possibly defeat the enemies with the mass numbers, mass sizes, and even demons so easily?  This in all honesty has that feeling that if I read it to my son for a bedtime story, all would be ok.  <BR>     Don't let these questions deter you away from this novel/author though.  As said above, the next novel shows real promise... within the first chapter I noticed a difference in the writing style.  Pick this up, and begin your journey with Drizzt, Wulfgar, Bruenor, and &quot;Rumblebelly&quot; (as the halfling is called)	2002-10-04

Brothers in Arms chronicles further the young Majere brothers and even their sister Kitiara.  Beware up front-- since this is the younger Raistlin, he's not the mean and nasty Black Robe of Chronicles!  In here (the novel) the reader finds themselves watching the Majere brothers through some time of their 'soldiers of fortune' days.<BR>During the novel, especially throughout the training of the mercenary army, the theme seems to slip from Dragonlance to that of a bootcamp manual... hence the 4 stars not 5 (along with a few other events that I won't spoil for anyone)... only to never fully get back into the grove of DL.<br />Would I recommend it?  Even so, yes!  To newcommers of DL, this will help you understand Raistlin and Kitiara much better (Caramon doesn't really change, lol), and for the old-time DL fans, this still can give some insight that was perhaps missed in later novels.	2002-08-28

In this novel there are monsters with and without magic, a hero who faces an actually believable amount of foes, the fighting scenes are terrific (some even bordering on the \\"oh, God! That was too brutal!\\"  It has a share of the erotic, a splended array of characters, and the world that is built is exquisite.<br />Another top-notch author who truly understands the need to paint a picture as vivid as possible to suck the reader in.

First off, let me say that the synopsis mentioned above isn't exactly correct.  Second off, keep in mind that this *is* a mystery-type novel.  Very well done, too might I add, lol.  The story of how Tanis and Flint (he's as grumpy as ever!)came together is told here, alas evil is afoot.  Someone is killing off elves, and circumstances are just right for Tanis to be accused.  Flint has to find evidence of Tanis' innocence or he (Tanis) will be banished... a fate worse than death for elves...<br />This story also follows many childhood years of Gilthanis, Porthios, and Laurana... touches on the love exsisting (or not) between Tanis and Laurana.  Many well written clues are given in the novel, and yet (for DL fans) it's easy enough to get so engrossed in the tale that you miss them until the killer is revealed! Once I read who it was, I slapped my forehead and grumbled to myself that I should've known ;) The suspects that are created through the writing are plenty... nearly everyone... <br />Only one complaint though... the final battle was too short, too conveniant, too 'of all the luck'... but this setback doesn't really cut into the enjoyabilty of the novel.	2002-05-21

A great read... the words seem to come to life and allow you to &quot;live the story&quot; as it were.  Anne Rice has a way with putting the reader &quot;into&quot; the story (truthfully I thought it was a fluke of sorts with 'Interview...', I quickly learned the error in that way)- allowing the the reader to &quot;see&quot; the events that happen AS they happen, all through the eyes of Lestat.<BR>    The story of Armand is expanded (a little), the story of Lestat's creator, and many more (not in any way less important)characters dance through the mind as the reader is captured by printed words.<BR>     I put the novel down only to sleep (even read as I cooked dinner, changed the baby's diaper,etc.: which is hard to do :) and the longer I was away from it, the more I longed to pick it up again.	2002-04-04

I'll admit that I had my doubts about this book (when I first picked it up, the bookstore had it under romance: why I have no idea).

I din't want to put the book down!  As others have reviewed, I did find a few repetitions and what-not, however the story in no way (and I highly emphasize that point)was ruined.<br />The author's story telling was among the best I have read (being an avid fan of King, Koontz, to name a couple)and her way of twisting and turning the plot and characters is masterful!

What in the world could you possibly be waiting for?!  King's character developement has always been good... here (like \\"The Stand\\")it's esceptional!  As I read this I literally tuned out the rest of the world and focused on nothing but the book... (which by the way, if your married I don't recommend doing... she got REALLY upset)  Another thing that King excelled in (again like \\"The Stand\\") was his attention to detail... an area where he never really faltered anyway.<br />The Nevada town of Desperation hides a secret known to few... known to even fewer is the Evil in that secret.  By coincidence, or perhaps fate, a group of strangers is brought to this town... and while here they discover the murderous secret that has ravaged the town... streets are empty, doors unlocked, bicycles laying upside-down in the streets with no children laying claim to them...

I am sorry I waited for those few months!<br />  Trisha, the heroin, showed remarkable bravery when she gets lost in the woods... all she wanted to do was teach a little lesson to her Mother and brother.  Armed with her imagination ( sometimes the worst weapon and defense of all) and her walkman, Trisha kept trying to find a way out, only to get in deeper and deeper.<br />This is one of the very few times that I actually hoped for the bad things NOT to happen...I wanted nothing but sunshine and butterflies for Trisha (trust me, I can't explain it either, lol)<br />but nevertheless I was very satisfied at ALL the occurances, details, and depth of this book...<br />I can say only one thing more... don't shy away because it's not a thick book... you'll be very pleased with your purchase!	2002-01-30

After a while other conditions prevent her from playing and she runs off, unable to withstand the &quot;torment&quot; of the new harper's playing music mixed with the constant chastizing of her family... girls are not supposed to be harpers you know... as she runs off, she comes across a clutch of firelizard eggs in danger.  As she saves it, she finds herself in danger of thread, and holds up with the clutch which happens to hatch at that time;after a number of the young impress, the adventures for Menolly continue to grow... <BR>Oh yeah, I don't want to give too much more away, but circumstances make Menolly well sought after by the Masterharper... only neither one know that it's her!	2001-12-31

I struggled with defining and keeping all the different Weyers, and Holds, and Fort holds, etc... at first, but gradually (about 3/4 of the way through the first novel) everything sunk in and became clear.  The only real disappointment in the whole thing was how much sci-fi compared to fantasy was evident-- don't get me wrong, it's a great mix of both.. but some synopsis are a little neglecting on this point...<BR>McCaffrey's take on the dragons not being able to breathe fire (or any weapon of destruction as with commonplace)was a real gratifying twist on things.  <BR>If you can get past any frustrations regarding the holds and Wyers and such... you'll truly enjoy these novels, and be begging for the next in line.	2001-12-31

I picked up &quot;Sword&quot; after I had read &quot;First King&quot;... I never really even thought about reading Brooks before he was recommended by a friend.  Of course, to my dismay, when I went to the bookstore I saw row upon row of the Shannara series.  So I picked up &quot;First King&quot; (seeing Prelude on the cover) and went at it.    Admittingly, when doing this I was more tuned into the 'feel' of Shannara, and I could easily point out a few discrepencies between the two novels, but hey no author's perfect.  As far as the whole theme I read of others' reviews comparing this to Tolkien's work... any/ and just about every fantasy will dim when compared to Tolkien...      Shea and the rest of the &quot;cast&quot; are indeed your typical fantasy heroes and villains... segregated into thier 'classes', nothing too special there.  Ahh, but the sword... now that power was something I wouldn't have expected.  The battles are engaging, the journey itself (and all the side roads) are well thought out and descriptive... easily &quot;a close your eyes and you can see the world as Brooks lays it out before you.&quot;  The only slow part is the length of the journey, though... but if you continue with the series you'll note that that too is shortened but still descriptive.      If you like a good epic, ignore the comparisons, open your mind and enjoy.	2001-08-23

A fantastic job by Michael Williams placing all the different characters into the grand scheme.  Many times an author will have a character that, by the end of the book, the reader will ask him/her self &quot;What was he/she doing in this story anyway?&quot;... not here n this book.  Every character had his/her place, and fit the bill well too!<br />This story picks up where Weasel's Luck leaves off, and continues the adventures of Galen Pathwardin-Brightblade, aka the Weasel.  During this novel, Galen tries to shrug off the Weasel aspect and prove that he could be a knightly knight.  The opals that he had kept after his ordeal with the Scorpion, have another purpose than mere decoration...showing Galen visions of Evil things ahead.<br />Surprising things happen here in this novel, and as I said... during the novel I had to ask myself &quot;why this?&quot; and &quot;what happened to...?&quot;  Rest assured, the answers come at the conclusion and all the puzzle becomes complete.<br />Enjoy!	2001-02-08

I hope that Mr. Parkinson will write many more Dragonlance novels.  While his characters weren't too developed, they were also not overkilled with detail (such as the details of 4 generations of their families, etc.).  The story itself ran smooth as silk, no contradictions in itself, just the right amount of humor too.<br />Chane Feldstone, an orphan dwarf with no traces of his lineage, has a dream.  Not like that of great men, but a dream that reoccurs constantly about an old helmet.  He loves a dwarven woman who's father hates him (such as in-laws are, lol), and when Chane reveals that his dream is actually fate calling him... her father plans to have him &quot;taken care of&quot;... thus beginning Chane's quest and his adventures.  Along the way he meets 'Chess' a kender, Bobbin- an insane gnome (you'll understand when you read it, lol), a human that goes by Wingover, and some others... then along the way Chane and his friends have to face armies of a Highlord (goblins, Hobgoblins, and a few Ogres).<br />The whole &quot;concept&quot; in the synopsis of &quot;uniting Thorbardin&quot; is barley skirted upon... instead its about the finder of Grallen's helm bringing Thorbardin to a time that it once was...<br />Very descriptive in battles, features and other things, and the combination of Kender and Gnome (insane remember) is a thoughtful added spice of humor.  I highly recommend this book to Dragonlance fans.	2001-02-04

True enough, the story itself is a very thoughtful one;the way it was told was just the down side.  Not to belittle Borchardt at all, I just couldn't get into this book as with the first.<br />I figured wow, the story of Maniel... this should be cool.  Yet when I got about halfway through it, I thought that I was back in school doing an assignment!  To finish the book, I literally had to force myself.  Too many flashbacks and flash-fowards, and the characters didn't seem to be as deep as before.<br />Will I try the third in the series?  Probably, but it will be hard to start it with the memory of this one haunting me; And I hate to give a bad review of anything!	2001-02-01

I finally decided to pick up &quot;First King...&quot; and was thoroughly pleased!<br />Bremen, an outcast Druid... learns of an Evil that can destroy the Four Lands.  He must convince the Druids, as well as other races of the threat and unite them all to face this Evil.  He is not alone however, a small party joins him and so the race is on to save the world.<br />Bremen is shown visions of how to accomplish the quest; four to be exact, and while he and his party members split up, secrets are revealed by some and tragedy experienced by all.  <br />The Sword of Shannara is a bit much though, but I do like the idea of the magic it contains (won't give up too much info.  hee hee).  This novel is filled with battle after battle laid out in thrilling detail, and the story keeps the reader interested and entranced until-- before you know it, you're looking at the back cover!<br />I started with &quot;First King...&quot; and now its on to the rest of the Saga...	2001-02-01

I thought 'well, let's see how the infamous Anne Rice's sister holds up...'<br />At any rate, this story is beautifully written with descriptions so thorough that you can close your eyes and perhaps see yourself in Rome.  Regeane, a daughter of royalty having to deal with poverty and family who are so dispicable they beat her and treat her cruely besides.  In the mind of Gundubald, Regeane's uncle, and his son Hugo... the treatment of Regeane is justified... for they know a secret of hers.<br />By night Regeane becomes the silver wolf, straining to be free, longing for the freedom of long ago.  Throught this novel, the reader is taken through Rome, in its sewers, on the Compagna, etc. all with intensity.  Throughout, Regeane learns of family secrets, marriage, and begins to learn the game of politics/religion.<br />Thuroughly enjoyable, can't wait to begin &quot;Night of the Wolf&quot;...	2000-12-16

Who knows if this review will in fact be read (as there are so many), yet none-the-less here goes.  I had a little difficulty keeping this one open for the second half (if you believe it, usually the problem lies with the first half)!  Don't get me wrong, it's a great read, but the reader HAS to be commited to this series to completely enjoy #4.  Mr. Jordan gives us further insight into the characters of Rand and company.  <br />Rand is going into the Aiel Waste, to do what HE wants and thinks has to be done (still under the watchful eye of Moraine). For the reader, this (I should say these) section(s)of the novel is/are where the Aiel become more in-depth, including their customs, septs, clans, etc.<br />Perrin... he has his hands full!  He hears of Two Rivers being under attack from Trollocs, and decides to go and see what can be done about it.  Personally, I feel that the main &quot;chunk&quot; of this novel is about this scenerio (but others may differ).<br />Elayne and Nynaeve are still searching for the Black Ajah, and they get themselves into a big 'ole frying pan there!<br />I won't give away any kind of endings to the scenerios above (as I myself hate that)but I will say that &quot;The Shadow Rising&quot; is by far (hands down, no contest, etc.) the best and most descriptive &quot;chapter in this saga&quot;.  Even with the slower parts, it still easily gets five stars!  Oh, and the total amount of pages (1008 pages) is including the Glossary (starting at pg984) and the &quot;About the author page), so while yes it is still a high number, don't be too discouraged by that amount of pages... I'm sure glad I wasn't!	2000-11-26

The reader will also be introduced to some creatures new to DL.<br />By the way--Clotnik... is a dwarf who, like Tanis, seeks knowledge of his family...  this is a really good novel by Barbara and Scott Seigel; a captivating addition to the Dragonlance saga!	2000-10-17

All in all, this was a very enjoyable novel, complete with the humor of the Aghar (gully dwarves), a love interest of Flint's named Perian, magic from the derro of the Theiwar clan of Thorbardin, and the forming of an evil army.  This novel definatley gives the reader a different aspects(s)of Flint, for the good, and his family is even broadened here.  No other companions, though they are sorely missed during Flint's journey and adventures (by Flint himself) and one thing that was real interesting... in all the other Preludes novels (excluding &quot;Tanis, the Shadow Years&quot;--just getting to that one)the evil queen tries to enter this domain.  In this novel she's only mentioned through her forces of evil.  No plots of hers are destroyed like the other novels...<br />All in all, worthy of all 5 stars... maybe even more!!	2000-10-13

This was my introduction to McCaffrey's writing, and it won't be the last!  From page one 'till the end I was enthralled.  The story of a dredge known as Lessa, her story and her growing popularity among others on Pern was in itself a seperate story.  The whole idea of telepathically talking to dragons is beyond anything I've read to date.  The going 'between' idea is yet another phenom of McCaffrey's writing.  The thread, silver strands that fall from the Red Star and incinerate anything living, is as much of a villain as some of the characters.

This second entry in the Pern series is yet another great attachment to my bookshelves.  In this we are introduced to the fire lizards, flying lizards that can breathe fire/attach themselves to Pernesians just as the dragons do/annoyances in some cases, and we begin to see the downfall of the &quot;united&quot; feeling among Dragonriders.  Greed and tradition take over for some of the oldtimers, and then things begin to heat up for a controling figure.  <br />Only one complaint... the names.  At some times (like at 3am) its somewhat hard to differentiate F'lar and F'nor and such... but that complaint isn't worth taking away anything from the well deserved rating!	2000-10-10

Ruth, beloved White dragon of Lord Jaxom, adds a slight comedic approach to things.  Ruth's innocence in the answers and statements are both comedic (at times) and smart alicky.  <br />Ruth is not supposed to be.  A White is said to not be able to mature, and therefore shouldn't be able to attach (McCaffrey's exact wording slips my mind)to anyone.  Yet Lord Jaxom helps Ruth out of the egg, and from then on its a match.<br />Follow these two through an adventure of trying to find more lands, and of course more history.  Will Ruth fight Thread?  It's what they (Jazom and Ruth) want... will they be allowed to follow in the Dragonriders footsteps since Lord Jaxom is Ruatha Hold's keeper?

The story of Christopher Snow began with &quot;Fear Nothing&quot;, and at the end of that novel, one could very well say &quot;OK, it's the end.&quot;  This is a sequel, if memory serves me correct the only sequel of a story by Koontz, but it's not needed as a sequel.  Christopher Snow, Bobby, and the rest of the gang are back, only this time the children in the town are disapearing!  Follow them through these pages (in the storyline its 2 days and nights)and you'll witness the changes in town running rampant.  Overcoming these odds are alot harder than in &quot;Fear Nothing&quot;<br />The only part that I disagree with is the intro.  It states that this is a journal of Christopher Snow, and if we are reading this then he must be dead... a little disappointing for the reader to read that right off, but you may be surprised!<br />The end (I won''t give anything away except that a third novel is not wanted by me, but instead needed!).	2000-10-10

To find out the truth, he has to run from shadow to shadow (also having to avoid street light), follow wicked bad guys to who knows where and in the end stumble upon a mystery/problem greater than his father's bodysnatching...

This book is a continuation of the short &quot;Heart of Goldmoon&quot; in 'Love and War (Tales III) by Laura Hickman and Kate Novak.  Not only did the novel stay true to the outline of Goldmoon and Riverwind, but continued smoothly and correctly from the short mentioned above.  The novel explains further the trials of the two Que-Shu, and leads their relationship to what it is in 'Chronicles', very well written, and very well thought out.  To be this continuous in the story line must have been hard to do, but do it the authors do.  Gully dwarves, draconians, ophidian dragon-men, clerics, a banish tribe (city) of elves (the Hestites)and their story, and of course the black dragon Khisanth.  This book has a lot of different storylines wrapped up into one, but fear not... the story line always flows smooth.  A little time consuming, yes... but hey, why do you want to rush a good thing?  This explains also how together, Goldmoon and Riverwind can bring back the Goddess Mishakal's word, as well as her healing.  The descriptions of Xak Tsaroth are even as described in 'Chronicles'... obviously tedious homework was done to keep this novel true to form.	2000-10-06

Sure it doesn't have hordes of goblins, or dragons, but let's see... there's a demi-god, evil demons, prophecies that have to be figured out, and in general a great mix of action.  This book can explain a lot more about Raistlin and Caramon's relationship... and give a new outlook to the younger Raistlin.  Earwig Lockpicker is your typical kender, bringing in the comedy relief.  A great buy and a great read!	2000-09-30

This book doesn't downrate any of the characters as others have said (in fact that's the main reason, besides it being DL) that I picked it up), but the portrayal of Tas is still the same... with a little more depth. The idea of Gisella (a dwarf who actually prefers to have a little &quot;romp&quot; instead of paying with money)was actually interesting.  The story is not farfetched, its the story of Tasslehoff's journey back to Kendermore.  It certainly deserves 5 stars, but there was only one MINOR problem with it... the synopsis is incorrect with one thing.  In the synopsis it states that Tas has to face a wizard out to pickle one of every kind, when in fact it's two gnomes trying to fulfill thier life-quest.  A really enjoyable read, and the ending almost brought tears to my eyes...	2000-09-26

The synopsis says that this story is about Sturm's search for his father and Kitiara's early merc. days.  In fact, after reading this book, it seems that the search for his father was actually a sub-plot (with the majority of the adventure happening on the moon).  As far fetched as it seems (and one wonders if Thompson and Carter have been into Otik's finest ale) for the happenings to take place on the moon, the overall story is really good.  The gnomes (adding a sense of humor), a wise-cracking brass dragon, a mad man marooned and ruler of the tree-people on the moon, crystal ants, and magicians are present from page one.  A really good read.	2000-09-22

This is through the eyes, voice, and ears of Galen  Pathwardin.  His story, his trials, his growth.  The evil Scorpion is not  your typical villain either ... he shows more villains signs than those  before him.  Sadistic, truly evil... that's what makes a GOOD villain.  The  story merges with the di Caela family curse, adds magic, illusion, undead,  minotaurs, the list could go on and on.  An excellent read that requires  patience through the first half, but well worth the read.	2000-09-19

In this book, Robert jordan has once again seemed to make these characters alive.  I couldn't put the book down except when I HAD to (for work and sleep), but rest assured more sleepless nights were spent reading  (enthralled more like it) waiting to find out what happens to all.  I'm  currently on the third book, and those sleepless nights are here again!	2000-05-09

This first book (hopefully of many more)is of course a definitive one.  The characters are laid out in detail, and the detail grows as the story grows!  The only complaint is that this novel is a bit of a roller coaster,  but then; aren't all.  Through the slow parts, the book can easily be put  down, but when the action picks up, time seems to stand still. Robert  Jordan has created one of the finest works of art in this series, and I  hope that all following part one will be the same.  I quickly became  accustomed to the heroes and villians, making this rate up there next to  Dragonlance.	2000-01-11

Often times, a reader will establish a &quot;favorite&quot; character in a series such as this, and I assure you that your favorite(s) will be known early on.  From the battling Draconians  to the hidden and unfolding love story, this &quot;beginning&quot; is the  best reading that you will come by in quite a while..  Enjoy the humor of  Tasslehoff and follow the complexity of Tanis as well as Raistlin, all of  the characters are some of the best laid out in a long while....From this  book, your Journey begins...	1999-12-28

Winter Night... a great sequel to the evergrowing Dragonlance chronicles.  The ever extending and changing of characters' &quot;bios&quot; can only be expressed as WOW!   The seasons and the characters seem to mesh with  eachother...and you may find that your favorite; decided in the first book,  just may change!   Either way, the love story continues to grow, and the  battles are just as great, let the reign/ legend that Weis and Hickman have  created live on forever...	1999-12-28

Clearly this novel has excelled the hopes of most readers, and in time, your hopes.  True, sometimes characters have to &quot;change&quot; to get the plot twisted ( an unfortunate thing though)and then after words, the  character has to struggle to regain the &quot;stature&quot; he once had.   The action in this novel is gripping and the love story seems to finally  make itself completely apparent, not just something thrown in.  Once again,  Weis and Hickman have outdone themselves...and I can't wait to continue to  follow the entire Dragonlance saga...thank you (Weis/Hickman)for bringing  and creating this world for us to enjoy so much!	1999-12-28
