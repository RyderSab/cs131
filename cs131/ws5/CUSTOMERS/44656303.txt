The focus on one main character and one primary location was different from the usual fast pace of names and locations in other Grisham mysteries.  Still, it was full of intrigue and was not overly predictable.  The main character was very likeable under pressure and the scenary was fantastic.	2005-06-04

This book helped give me a greater understanding of past events and the fine line the Saudi royal family must balance between relationships with the US and their general citizens.  So interesting that the US is really responsible for much of the training and arming of the people we know consider terrorists.  It was interesting to read a fact-based history of American foreign policy which helped me put current events into perspective.	2005-06-04

Interesting story, great characters, complex plot lines, all told through a charming little boy's perspective.  I loved the use of photography, fonts, and artwork throughout the novel.  Especially helpful to demonstrate the visual work that the main character Oscar has grown up with.  I'd highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys reading something fresh, different and great for discussion.	2005-06-04

It was refreshing and fun.  The main character, Maggie, was likeable and imperfect as she ran away from her problems to live with a friend in LA and experiment with different parts of her personality.  In the end she realizes who she is and comes to peace with many things in her life - carreer and love.  It was fun to hear about Maggie's life thru a different perspective since she is sisters with Claire, the main character in Keyes's Watermelon.	2003-03-04

The novel has two stories.  In one, a scupltor struggles with his career and family and is comissioned to build a bear out of scrap metal for a small southern town.  The second story details how the bear scuplture divides the town into those who love it and those who hate it.  One man in particular is moved by the sculpture and it becomes a symbol of his family.  Years later, the scupltor's son comes to claim the bear from the man's daughter meet.  The result is tension, small-town gossip, and eventually some romance.  This story is very unique, full of interesting characters.  It is a nice, deep story in contrast to the many light-hearted Bridget Jones novels that are so popular today.	2003-03-04

The character development was interesting so that at the end of each story I found myself wondering what happens next.  I think each story is an extreme example of some trait that most women have as part of their personalities.  I picked Personal Velocity for our bookclub and it was a good book for discussion.  I'm glad I read this book, but don't think I would run out to read Miller's next one unless I heard good things about it.	2003-03-04

She writes about characters like Codi, a woman that hasn't yet found her place in life. Codi returns &quot;home&quot; to Arizona and we learn about her father and sister Hallie.  Codi struggles for come into her own and find a place where she belongs.  In contrast to some of Kingsolver's other novels, Animal Dreams is short and easy to read.  The plot is unique and the characters are interesting.	2003-03-04

The main character, Okonkwo, is a hard working tribal leader with pride in the customs of his tribe.  When he is forced into exile from the village Okonkwo is forced to learn about different people and traditions.  This book has a lot of symbolism and many lessons to teach.	2003-03-04

She learns more about her past, her family, and her own self worth through the novel.  In the end she finally confronts her ability to love.  The characters in the book are very likable and real.  The only complaint I had was the love story seemed a bit unrealistic, but I will read the sequel and see how it all turns out!	2003-03-04

It was an easy read and had great appeal, but I found it tragic and sad.  I sure hope the parents in the book are a culmination of all the bad things the nannies ran into during their careers and that no one set of parents was really that bad.  Because if not, the parents should be arrested for child neglect.  And the nanny should consider therapy for letting Mrs. X treat her sooo badly.  I would have quit!  Nanny Diaries was a good book, but don't pick it up expecting a &quot;light&quot; read.  There are some very funny parts, but overall the theme was how prevelant bad parenting is in this scene.	2003-03-04

I've always been easily convinced with &quot;Buy 1, Get 1 free&quot; sales and can talk myself into &quot;needing&quot; to purchase something.  Rebecca has some credit issues, but is not helpless.  Of course her adventures at work and with dating are also part of the fun.  She is smart and strong and most of all entertaining!	2003-03-04

However, I looked forward to reading Coulter's book to learn more about the supposed liberal bias of the media.  I found the book to have a \\"wining\\" tone.  It was a list of name callings and examples of mistreatments.  I think most of this is just public perception of conservative issues.  I'm not convinced by this book that life (people's opinions) imitates art (media).  It seems to me that the media is reporting more what the people want to hear.  Still, I am glad I read Slander and did learn alot about the negativism of politics on both sides of the fence.	2003-03-04

It's a quick, easy read, with lots of action.  The murders are more brutal than some of Patterson's books.  At least they catch the bad guys at the end so the conclustion was more satisfying than some of Patterson's latest books which continue.  The background was set in the Vietnam war and the military setting.  Cross sets out to save a man on death row accused of murders.  There are some repeat characters so I would not recommend starting with this book if you are not familiar with the Cross series.  If you love the Alex Cross series, Four Blind Mice will not disappoint you - there are several unpredictable twists!	2003-03-04

Although the book was interesting and informative, there were no surprises or new insights.  If you are looking for an introduction to the Clinton administration or just a new perspective on his character, The Natural was great.	2003-03-04

Just when you think the main character has a tough life, you meet the 2 men she hires.  Talk about perspective.  All of a suddon she seems to have the privledged life.  This is a story of people in dire conditions who learn to work together against the societal norms.  Although this book was fairly long, it kept my attention and was not an &quot;easy&quot; book.  It was challenging and well worth the reward of finishing.	2002-10-02

The play was multi-layered with different periods of time and phases of life. Basically, Empire Falls is a story of people who are trying to deal with the inconsistencies in their dreams, realities, and things outside their control.	2002-10-02

I loved getting to know the characters and observing how they reacted with each other.  What happens when a group of people from all walks of life are forced into a situation where all of their roles, status, money, and skills are turned around.  The poor have the power.  The rich, sucessful are deamed powerless.  And in a &quot;hopeless&quot; situation, people find love for each other and for the beauty of music and their own individual talents.  I really enjoyed reading this book and would highly recommend it to others.	2002-10-02

I enjoyed Animal Dreams enough to seek her other books and particularly enjoyed Prodigal Summer and Poisonwood Bibles the most.  I just love when you find a new author and race to read everything she has written. <br />Prodigal Summer was rich in character development - it focussed separately on several characters that you kept reading to figure out how they were related.  I enjoyed the focus on nature and farming as a background for the purity of hard work and cycles of good and bad that life presents.  This book presented a realistic view of life full of positive things, but not a life with fairytale endings.	2002-10-02

If Looks Could Kill is a non-traditional fun murder-mystery, that is easy to follow and fun to read.  Great to see strong female characters with real issues (if not real lives).  Much more funny and likeable that a traditional murder mystery novel, I read somewhere a description of this book that sums it up for me -- Sex in the City meets Nancy Drew.  It was refreshing for me to see two of my favorite genres of books meld together into a fun, page-turning novel.	2002-10-02

An quick read about the life of a Saudi princess -- this book was a page turner.  This book was an interesting insider's look into the hardships and challenges of being a woman in the royal Saudi Arabian family.  And Sultana is one of the lucky ones -- she was allowed to get an education and her husband truly cares for her.  Even still, her life is full of struggle and hardship.  Her friends were drowned or locked into a padded room when they displayed any ounce of independence.  Her sister suffered through a terrible marriage where she was abused and mistreated.  I particularly liked the how the book included information on the history of Saudi Arabia and highlights of some of the existing laws.  I thought this book was definitely written for a western audience; I would recommend this book to anyone seeking to learn more about the Saudi culture and the day-to-day lives of women in this culture.	2002-04-18

It included romance, legal battles, family issues, honor, mystery, and corruption.  There were a lot of characters to keep track of and the plot involved multi-generations of people.  It really made me think about the death penalty.  I don't read a lot of mystery novels, but this was the same type of enjoyment as a John Grisham or James Patterson book.	2002-04-18

Maybe I just could not relate to Jay or to Joe the mysterious ghostly gardener.  I finished this book in just a few hours and it did hold my attention.  It did include beautiful scenary with great details of nature and the art of gardening.  The character development was fairly flat.  The great mystery of the of the silent neighbor Marise was disappointing.  After Chocolate and Five Quarters of the Orange, I was expecting another 5-star novel.  Instead I got a solid, interesting, and decent book.  Definitely read her other novels first!	2002-04-18

A woman named Framboise moves back to her home town to the same farm she grew up on.  She reflects back upon her childhood and the scandalous events that forced her family to leave this town many years ago.  The story switches back and forth between Framboise growing up with her siblings in occupied France during WWII and her life years later as a cafe owner with children and grandchildren of her own.  The theme of food preparation and the smells of fresh ingredients vividly leap off the page.  I especially enjoyed learning about Framboise's frigid mother who was tormented by headaches which were agrivated by the smell of an orange.  Her mother's story is pieced together through a scrapbook of recipes and fragments which is given to Framboise upon her death. I couldn't put this book down and can't wait to read the rest of Harris's writings.	2002-02-14

But after reading Keyes's Lucy Sullivan, I was disappointed in Watermelon.  Although both books had many of the same elements, I had a hard time relating to Watermelon's Claire.  Claire's husband tells her that he is leaving her while she is in the hospital, having just delivered their first child.  Claire flies home to her parents and sisters with her new baby and begins to heal.  Only Marian Keyes can make a plot like this with laugh out loud humor.  This is a book about heartbreak, survival and the importance of loving and supportive family.	2002-02-14

Ambrose's book was assigned for a political science class I took in college.  It was wonderful to finally read about &quot;modern history&quot; without having to study each event in-depth.

This one is not brain candy, but a true novel that makes you think.  Each set of characters is unsatisfied with some element of life.  The characters were very alive with real emotion: the frustration of the suburban mother who just wants to be alone to read; the confusion of a lesbian mother who feels like a sell-out; the emotional breakdown of an author who is both brilliant and fragile.  I absolutely loved the ending of this book.  Definitely worth reading, but not my favorite book that I plan to re-read.	2001-12-03

It sounded like fun!  Keyes delivered with a funny, sad, and cute story about the 20-something lifestyle.  Lucy is a single working girl adventuring through a boring job, happy hours, dating, and girlfriends.  Many of her adventures hit close to home, though at times I wanted to shake her a bit to wake up and smell the coffee.  This book is a great airplane, beach, or pure entertaining read.

James Patterson deviates from the usual serial murder mystery with this romantic story.  Suzanne's Diary for Nicholas is the story of a woman writing to her son.  It is also told through the point of view of another woman reading the journal.  This is a beautiful story of love, family, tragedy, and recovery.  Just when you think the story is predictable and a little too mushy, Patterson delivers a twist that made me cry and also made me recommend this short, quick novel to everyone I see.	2001-12-03
