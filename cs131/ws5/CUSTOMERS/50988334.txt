I am so tired of authors who ring a good note, then play it over and over again for the rest of their careers, especially in fantasy series. ELEGY is a great example of Haydon's flexibility. <br /> <br />The beloved characters that were introduced in the Rhapsody trilogy have changed somewhat, as people tend to do, and the evils who were introduced in earlier volumes, as well as a few who make their debuts here, bring a new kind of menace to the world. She writes in the same excellent fashion, but with a different flavor, much like a change in a musical piece.  <br /> <br />I highly recommend ELEGY, though perhaps it is not the best place to begin the series. While not the tome that DESTINY was, it is definitely an engaging, engrossing, terrifying and beautiful read. <br />	2004-08-22

While there's been a slight improvement since the horrific Wayfarer Redemption, in which points of view changed within the same paragraphs, the clunking prose and the simpering dialog is still abundant, and the constant taint of amateurish style is never far away. <br />Perhaps it would behoove Ms. Douglass to find a collaborator with whom to write. She could provide her insight and plot ideas, based on whatever scholarship she has attained, to a genuine wordsmith. Maybe then the work would be readable.	2004-07-16

I find Ms. Douglass to be somewhat more competent here than she was in her awful Wayfarers Redemption, but that's not saying much.

The purple prose and self-aggrandizing style of narration set my teeth on edge, but I read and enjoyed DART because it was different.

An Intelligent Read	I made the mistake of reading the review that precedes mine on this page, but it helps to clarify whether or not you should read this book. If the only type of fantasy you want is the kind in which a mighty male warrior decapitates a lot of people then throws a naked woman over his shoulder, as that reviewer suggested, you should definitely NOT read this book.<br />On the other hand, Rhapsody is not at all a romance novel. It contains some of the best male characters I have ever read about, particularly the character of Achmed the Snake, the assassin king. The writing is gritty and captivating, and highly intelligent. There are many layers of plot, and the author's care in building a world that makes SENSE in its history, its magic and its story is evident. <br />So, in short, if you want a wonderful story with fabulous characters, lots of action and lore, this book is for you. Otherwise, read Conan.	2003-11-01

I was impressed at the beginning, but I have to say I am even more impressed at the end. The battle scenes in these books, which were built with meticulous buildup, are horrifying, wondrous, and spare, without the sickening embellishments so many others indulge in, but rather show the stark, grim reality of war. The beauty of the world Elizabeth Haydon has created is palpable. A must read for anyone who appreciates stellar writing.	2003-08-05

Haydon depicts that world with the same aplomb in which she composed the first movement of the Symphony of Ages, but in a decidedly different voice. This is a more transitional book, a continuation of a tale that is obviously being told as a history, rather than as a never-ending saga [Robert Jordan] or discrete, unrelated books [Goodkind]. <br />I think I enjoyed Requiem in some ways even more than the first three books. The heroine was not as central as in the trilogy, allowing for interesting character development between the others, especially Achmed and Ashe, who are forced to hold their noses and work together to find her. The subtleties of the relationship-building are the sign of a true master writer.<br />If you haven't give the Symphony of Ages a listen, you don't know what you're missing.	2003-06-04

I liked Kushiel's Chosen, though I admit I think the characters I had been so intrigued with in the first book had lost a lot of their edge. Now it is gone completely. Kushiel's Avatar still has some of the grit left, but on the whole I have to admit it took me a very long time to finish this book I had anticipated so much. I read Dart in a single sitting, avoiding sleep and even sit-down meals. This was a struggle to finish. The plot is average, not what I have come to expect of Carey. I guess this is an interesting analogy to the passion and hard core sex that has been Ms. Carey's stock in trade. Even the hottest of fires cools to ash. Sometimes I guess it flares out quickly. I am glad to see this story is finally over. I will probably read Elegy for Darkness, just to see if she can rejuvenate my interest, but I will not preorder it, nor will I buy it in hardcover.

There is something so innately wrong with a modestly talented modern writer who cannot leave the modern age behind her when composing, who insists on recasting classic figures in a pseudo-classic style that threatens to break the fourth wall altogether by the end of the trilogy. Ick. These characters are sort of the stock from bad twenties movies, with the dialog to boot. <br />Now, on the good side. There is less of the silly, predictable stuff of the Wayfarer Redemption, Douglass's earlier effort, though the curses are as flat here as the prophecies were there. The characters are still not very well drawn, but they are somewhat better. On the whole, Douglass is improving, but this icky combo of fakey modern classic era god-knows-what is still not worth paying hardcover price for.	2003-03-13

It made me uncomfortable, not because of its graphic sex and s/m elements, but because I thought the prose was sickeningly sweet and rich, the marks of a somewhat talented amateur, and I also thought the heroine was grotesquely perfect [jeez! Great in bed and she can SING, too! The J-Lo of fantasy!] But I did like it enough to buy this one. What a mistake.<br />This book shows that an arguably brilliant beginning is difficult to sustain. Ms. Carey told a fine story the first time out, but it is now wearing thin.

I say that even though I enjoyed most of the other books in the Crown of Stars series, but this one is harder to like for some reason. I think Ms. Elliot is a fine author, but a weak and inconsistent one, not up with the likes of the big name female fantasists like Melanie Rawn, Elizabeth Hayden and Robin Hobb. <br />Having said that, however, it was nice to see something in the series out again, especially since Melanie Rawn seems to have disappeared from the face of the earth. And this book has already been spammed by the Robert Stanek [or as my friends and I refer to him, Robert Stank] e-publicity machine, which means they think it is a good enough book to ride the coattails of. <br />It's not that bad, respectable for middle of the road stuff.

While some [and I stress the word SOME] of the ideas in thie series have interesting beginnings, the writing is so bad, and the characters so genuinely unlikeable, that it is hard to give a good damn what happens to any of them. The names are childish in their sound, and the silly prophecy which they are following has no interesting twists to the outcome, so it was basically as dumb at the end as it was at the beginning.

She is one of the finest writers working in the genre today, and by far the best female epic fantisist out there. The loss I felt when the trilogy was over is now comforted by the knowledge that she intends to continue the series.<br />Requiem for the Sun is a different sort of book than the Rhapsody trilogy. It is faster, funnier, more of a page turner and less of a historical opus. Instead, it has the benefit of more of the same great characters [Rhapsody, Achmed, Grunthor, Ashe and Anborn] with a more gripping, intense tale. Ms. Haydon upholds her reputation as an unparalleled wordsmith, proving she's got the right stuff for the long haul.<br />Highly recommended.	2002-11-19

I didn't have as much of a problem with the kinky sex as many seem to, though I thought it was a little like watching the author gratify herself and a bit emploitative at the same time. My problem was that the writing in this series is overpraised. If Ms. Carey didn't take her message so seriously, and realized that the story superedes all the cutesy philology with inconsistent accents, it would have been a better book. Still, I see why it was popular. It was dirty. All the high minded praise in the world can't cover for that real reason.<br />Now comes Kushiel's Chosen, and it is much more obviously flat, more shrill, less exciting, and even more pompously written. But the lightning won't strike twice. When you rely on cheap gimmicks, rather than real skill, to hook the audience, it is hard to make it happen more than once. Joscelin has to be one of the stupidest and least convincing characters of all time.<br />In short, if this book or its predecessor gives you the vapors, then there is a whole genre of erotica out there that more unabashedly will accomplish the same result.

Within this era of calm, however, evil is brewing in many different places--a political coup to the south in Sorbold, the bloody plans of a murderous assassin queen bent on revenge, and the long-denied lust of a demonic monster. Haydon is such a master of suspense that I found myself physically anxious as I read, turning pages and being afraid to stop reading. <br />While the focus is more on the male protagonists in this book--the uneasy relationships between Achmed, Gruntor and Ashe, as well as some older-generation characters--it is amazing to see how firmly entrenched these \\"people\\" are in my mind, and how much I care about them. The loss of one who has been with the series from the beginning was heartbreaking, but Haydon writes with a brutal honesty that reflects life in all its glory and horror.

It was better than the Last Dragonlord, which read like a young adult romance novel with juvenile characterizations and dialog, but not enough for me to move it up to the next star.<br />I agree with the reviewer who said that it's easy to stick a dragon, a unicorn or a wizard in a book and get a whole bunch of people who love those things to praise it. I happen to like all three of those things, but I like them done &lt;well&gt;. I didn't get the impression Joanne Bertin understands the mysteries of a dragon's soul at all. <br />I suggest The Encyclopedia of Things that Never Were, for a look into the intricacies of mythological things. Smaug in the Hobbit is a great one as well, scary and avaricious. Also Elizabeth Hayden writes the best dragons and half-dragons I've seen in modern fantasy, with a multiplicity of personalities all of which are draconic, not a convenient secret identity that flies and does cool things. It's impossible for me to imagine that a human who truly shares a soul with a dragon could just kind of go &quot;hey! I'm a dragon, by gum!&quot; one day. <br />This book is dumb.

It's annoying when one character is the center of the universe and knows it. <br />I liked Sword Dancer, but these books are written in romance novel style, even if they are fantasy. I find Tiger a very unconvincing male character, with motives and dialogs clearly written by a woman, and Del is annoying beyond belief. Ick. Ptui.	2002-03-06

I don't think Fitz is a particularly amazing character, and I find Hobb to be close to Bujold in her telling of the reluctant hero tales. I also think the writing is less polished than before. But it was not too bad.	2002-03-06

Does anyone else wonder what kind of fantasy world has a hero named Richard, and a character named Betty, when others have names like Jagang and Oba? This little example shows a tiny portion of the problem with Terry Goodkind's series and with the latest attempt, PILLARS OF CREATION. There is no cohesive thought in any of these books. Characters like Rachael and Chase are introduced, then disappear. Plots are recycled. Stream of consciousness shallow writing takes the place of any kind of world building or suspense. <br />I had great hopes for this after the first two books, and have watched in dismay as it hit the skids, and now the toilet. The die hards that only tune in for the sex, the cliffhangers and the gore are going to love anything Goodkind puts out, but I think the readers with more than two brain cells to rub together are going to leave, sooner or later. I know I am done.	2001-12-09

Blending action and great characters, Elizabeth Haydon has broken the mold of the standard &quot;hero with a sword. son of unknown father destined to rule the world&quot; stereotype. In addition, she does not give us the typical Xena babe but a heroine with strengths and flaws dealing with powers in the way a real person would--being baffled by them. I love Achmed, one of the best characters of fantasy literature to date, and Grunthor, who demonstrates a nice balance between fierce loyalty and pregmatism. <br />What is most amazing is the writing, however. It's evocative and beautiful, with haunting descriptions and clear sighted imagination. Shadowfire and the like are full of hot air; this is a great book.	2001-12-04

That was a reasonably good book, but didn't really warrant a continuation of the story. The characterization is lame and Lasky does nothing to make you like these people, or care what really happens to them.	2001-08-04
US	50988334	R36WB6VMTL189I	0966692926	29927393	The Pleistocene Redemption	Books	1	13	15	N	N	Wretched	Not everyone can be an author. This books proves it beyond words. You can publish anything these days, but it doesn't mean that the result if worth reading. In this case, it certainly is NOT.<br />Mr. Gallagher's attempt to be a published author falls flat from the first sentence. The ideas are nothing new, and the characters never take shape. I forced myself to read the whole thing so that the person who gave it to me could not claim it got better later on in the text, which it definitely does NOT. This is a book written with the skill of an amateur 13 year old but with an impressive cover. The cover gets the single star in this review. The rest has been pulped and is mulching my wife's tomato plants.	2001-07-17
