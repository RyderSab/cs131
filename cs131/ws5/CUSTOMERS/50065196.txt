Do you know Benjamin Franklin? <br /> <br />Whether you do or don't, this is a eloquent and entertaining read for any American. What HASN'T he done? <br /> <br />Mr. Isaacson has done a wonderful job relating BF in an anecdotal style, about the Benjamin Franklin that was not taught to us in the course of our grade school education. Franklin's relationships with women, his wife, his sons or grandsons, his <br />fellow Americans or his fellow intellects, they are a study in fascination. How the same man could range from one end of the spectrum to the other intellectually/emotionally is simply a marvel. <br /> <br />Franklin, whom at one time considered himself a loyal Briton, was an inventor and constant tinkerer: he was always testing his hypothesis, not necessarily for science, but just because he was a naturally curious individual. Lightning rods, bifocal glasses...even the precursor to today's alkaline battery can be attributed to Franklin's scientific curiosity.  <br /> <br />As a public servant, he founded public libraries, volunteer fire departments, streamlined the colonial postal service, and established what is today known as Penn State University. <br /> <br />The biggest source of enjoyment I got from this book was the passages he had written, most often published under a pen name in his newspapers. His writings throughout his life showed a witty intellect: none his superior and few his equal. As his sword, his pen throughout his life was wielded for what he saw as injustices, and of course for American Independence.  <br /> <br />This brief overview leaves SO many fascinating facts/anecdotes out. You'll just have to read for yourself, but you'll not be sorry for the money you spend to get it.	2004-10-14

Being the astute Commander In Chief he was, he utilized that potential as best as he could for Allied Victory. In my opinion this is just more evidence of his heart and soul's desire to see the American people (and consequently ALL free people) survive the madness of the Nazis.<br />His activities ranged from having rich friends spy for him, to conspiring with Britain well before the United States' entry into the war in 1941. He started what now we know today as the CIA: all during a time when his administration was unknowingly riddled with Red Communists from Mother Russia.<br />But it wasn't all war business: In FDR like fashion, he had a tendency to wield his power for personal purposes. Before the streamlinging/defining of the various intelligence departments, he was getting reports of Eleanor's supposed infidelity from the Office of the Navy, and Hoover's FBI: even then he was firmly ensconced as Washington's unofficial watchdog, and it was well known there was no love lost between himself and the first lady.<br />Mr. Persico adds another dimension to the FDR presidency, and the war administration he conducted. World War II in most ways was when the government we know today was forged. Intelligence ranks among those foundations, and can also be laid at the feet of Franklin Delano Roosevelt.  Add this to your library, its a must have.	2002-05-24

Sherman	Books	4	13	16	N	N	Timeless Cump	Mr. Hirshson puts forth a complete life picture of General William Tecumseh Sherman (Tecumseh was his birth name in 1820, William added for his baptism as a young child). What strikes me foremost after reading this comprehensive biography, is that William T. was, just like anyone else, an ordinary man that was making his way as best he could.<br />Losing his father at a young age, he then had to adjust to going away to military school at West Point, in Upstate New York. There, he was the bane of the schoolmasters: never living up to his potential, was the constant troublemaker, and always challenged authority. Ultimately, this affected his overall grade, and it would cost him an appointment in the regular army after graduation.<br />With the prospect of a future in the army gone, Sherman tried to make his way: banker, lawyer, school teacher....all the while trying to support an ever expanding family with wife Ellen. This was a constant struggle during his whole married life; not having faith in any kind of religion, he constantly sparred with his wife and her Catholicism. He adored his children; the pain of son Willy dying in 1861 pained him the rest of his life. Another son, Charles, died without ever seeing his father. Third son, Tom, became a Jesuit and was forever as good as dead in his father's eyes.<br />The secession of South Carolina started what was then known as the &quot;War Between the States&quot;, and history for the ages was made. Bitter defeat at Shiloh (and a reported, supposed bout of insanity) to the ever famous March to the Sea, the end of the war coming with Johnston's surrender. Hirshson does not get into great depth with Sherman's relationship with Grant, but he does competently relay the affection the two had for each other as friends. Equally, the pain of betrayal equally relayed when, as President, Grant forsook his longtime friend in a bitter game of politics that darkened his administration along with its corruption.<br />Falling suddenlyill, Sherman followed his wife's lead into death on Valentine's Day, 1891. The Catholicism he battled personally his whole life was laid upon him in death, and he was put to rest with those Final Rites. His ending was quick, and merciful...fitting for a man of history. Put this one in your collection.	2001-09-08

The first noticed, right at the beginning, is that the President has the right to declare war.  When did this happen?  Tell the masses! Constitutional checks and balances are put by the wayside! Since the very debates that gave the American President its powers, this has never been the case. <br />And yes: They brilliantly nailed the presidential term of the third president Thomas Jefferson as starting in 1790. Kudos to the fact finding department! Most interesting, since the Washington started his term in 1789! <br />I'm very sorry I spent the measly $10 for this book. Most of the information contained in this book, that isn't incorrect, is simply information that is best suited for today's supermarket tabloids. I realize that Presidents and presidential associates, past and present alike, were/are far from perfect , but I wasn't interested in reading about their dirty laundry.<br />Two stars, one step above bottom, for the very limited quantity of fascinating informational pieces.	2001-05-19

Twenty years after his death, Mr. Catton is continually reasserting himself as THE author to read on the Civil War.<br />This book contains general overtures, as written for lectures delivered at Wesleyan University in 1958, that he'd presented when he was alive. Like the title implies, passages are simply....beautifully written.<br />The author takes you through a variety of topics, again generally: politics, the citizen solder, Lincoln, the terrible price of victory....  The layout of the literature is in lecture format, but does absolutely nothing to take away from what you're reading about.<br />Spend the few dollars, and put this into your collection. It belongs on everybody's Civil War shelf. To take a line from page 68:<br />We are a people to whom the past is forever speaking.	2001-05-19

On into through Mary's childhood, her marriage, education, her children (and her relationships with each), and the trial and tribulations that affected a woman of her station in the early-mid 19th century, most notably the War Between the States: The conflict that shattered and undeniably destroyed Mary's World with such a fierce finality.<br />For me, this presented a whole new perspective on an early part of United States history. For anyone interested in that, or women's biography, put this one in your collection. It's a keeper.	2001-02-24

In his sleep, Sirius, says &quot;He's at Hogwarts&quot;.  The target is obvious.<br />Or is it?  The mischievous side lands Harry a map that shows all the secret entrances into Hogwarts. This leads him to the most famously haunted house in all of Hogsmeade. Here he learns many truths about his present, his past, and unlocks the future.<br />Once again Rowlings does not fail to deliver delightful characters and their interactions. She doesn't lose sight of the fact that yes, we're still talking about a teenager, and yes, all the joys and growing pains are associated with that. Also once again, she manages to hide the real truth of the story until the end, where she does a masterful job tying it all together with a most edge-of-your-seat ending that makes it hard to put the book down.<br />Five Stars.

The fame obsessed Dark Arts teacher is the funniest...all text books are his own works.<br />We find Harry and his adventureous friends hearing rumors about the Chamber of Secrets, and the Heir of Slytherin: The one house that has produced the most dark wizards. But people (and Mrs. Norris, the cat) pop up petrified, and rumor suddenly becomes reality. The mysterious Heir of Slytherin is bound to unravel Hogwarts at its foundations.<br />The junior sleuths find their way to the Chamber of Secrets, and Harry once again to the Dark Lord himself, Voldemort.

I had bought this book to read to my children, but they had no interest when it was discovered there weren't pictures. So I read it myself.<br />This book is fantastic!  Like others have said, this is not just for kids!  I found the characters very engaging, even comical at times. Like George saying about himself and his twin, Fred: &quot;We know we're Gred and Forge&quot;.<br />It begins with Harry as an infant, and wizards and witches watching over his deliverance to &quot;muggle&quot; relatives. Harry has a terrible home life: relatives who don't love or care for him, and he lives in a cupboard.<br />The story comes alive from here.  Letters pouring in from anywhere there is an opening: chimneys, open windows, the opening between the door and the floor...Harry makes off to Hogwarts, magical school for wizards and witches alike.  New life, new friends, new magical adventures...<br />The story was original and delightful as Harry encounters this strange new world and how to deal with it.

I would say not likely.<br />Gerhard starts off with major points from WWI, and that WWII was not an extension of the earlier conflict. It was its own; the roots of the  war can be laid at different feet.<br />The author I'd noticed tends to repeat  himself on different topics of the war, and I think illustrations  complementing passages about the course of the battles would work nicely,  but still gripping all the same.<br />His thouroughness is quite evident: His  bibliography is huge. He'd obviously taken great time an effort for this  work. I would recommend this for someone looking to learn about the WHOLE  war. The information can be overwhelming and slow in some passages, but is  worth the read. A qualified 5 stars.	2000-07-04

Edgar Hoover puts forward strong evidence that he was the most powerful man in American History. He tracks a young Hoover who took over the FBI (though not named so in the beginning) and made it into a police power, most notably in 1932 when FDR signed into law the  ability for federal agents to carry firearms.<br />The author also gives an  astonishing account of how Hoover dealt with Presidents. He detested Truman  (a feeling reciprocated), was indifferent to Ike, and was good pals with  LBJ. Twice he was called to the Nixon White House, to be relieved of his  director duties. Both times he left with his job.<br />His personal life was  also circumspect. Never married, rumors that he was a homosexual were  fueled by the fact that his top lieutenant, Clyde Tolson, was always by his  side both on and off the job. <br />Hoover was not an elected official, but he  was the most proficient and influential politician of the 20th century.

It's  a collection of brief generalizations with a few anecdotes for each,  ranking the top ten (or bottom ten, depending on your point of view) from  bad to terrible. The author does make you think; James Buchanan was never  seen without his Senator bachelor roommate. Warren Harding's wife refused  permission for an autopsy, lending speculation that she poisoned him.<br />I'd  like to think that I'd come to the same conclusions if I read a biography  on each president he talks about.

This focuses on FDR's WWII War Administration: policies, attitudes, hopes and worldly goals.<br />FDR's dedication to the well-being of the United  States in WWII is evidenced by the fact that to start with, he didn't want  a third term in office come 1940. Indeed, such aspirations were frowned  upon in the political community. It did not stop him; as he saw it, it was  his duty and obligation to the American people to keep familiar leadership  in time of international turmoil. Other obstacles: struggles to arm allies,  constant planning and meeting with allied leaders, and gradual, failing  health. Burns also shows FDR's political savvy, using the utilization for  war to the nation's advantage. Many unemployed workers were put back to  work, which helped shift American industry into an overdrive that didn't  stop for decades. Vision: as a disciple of Woodrow Wilson, he had a vision  of a United Nations. One that he did not live to see.<br />For anyone reading  about FDR, or World War II, this companion volume on his war administration  is a must for anyone's collection, as it has become in mine.	2000-04-16

With every campaign talked about,  there are regional illustrations so the reader can follow along quite  easily (even me!). With these tellings he weaves interesting anecdotes;  brothers fighting on opposite sides of the war, or my favorite: A union  soldier stole across the Confederate lines dressed in civilian clothing to  enjoy a night of dancing out &quot;on the town&quot; with the single  ladies, to be back across to the Union side the next morning. The author  accomplished quite successfully the &quot;feeling&quot; that permeated the  war; from the exasperation of Washington with its generals to the long  winter of 1864 - 1865, where Lee's Army of Northern Virginia was always  hungry, at the point of starvation (often on 1/6 rations), and cold because  of a lack of boots or shoes. Indecision; General Lee had a Union Army  commission in which he took pride, but the loyalty to his home state of  Virginia is what decided his allegiance after the beginning of the  war.<br />As claimed on its jacket, this IS a complete one volume history of  the short lived life of The Confederate States of America. For anyone  looking to expand their knowledge on this period, I'd recommend this book  to be a good start.	2000-04-12

A real American Dream story; growing up in the midwest in a modest, hardworking family, fighting in WWI as a commander of his MO outfit, to a real &quot;Mr. Smith Goes to  Washington&quot;.   The author takes you through his trials (bankruptcy),  his annointment into the volatile world of Washington Politics, and  ultimately through to the White House. There he dealt with the bomb, White  House remodeling, Tom Dewey, and the Korean Conflict.<br />David also takes a  good look at Truman's policies from the beginning with his County seat,  right on up to his Presidential Adminstration. Truman cemented his place in  history with the bomb, and The Marshall Plan. He survived an assasination  attempt, detested Hoover, and was the reason why there are pension plans  for ex-presidents. <br />The personal aspect of Truman's life doesn't go  unnoticed. The undying loyalty he had to &quot;The Boss&quot;, his wife  Bess, their daughter Margaret, and his mother, was tenderly and  respectfully written about. This was proven when, he'd gotten to  Washington, he was lead to a hotel room. Upon opening the door and finding  a naked blonde woman on the bed, he turned an about face that would have  done his old army commander proud.<br />A must read.

Mr. Brands factual and seamless account of the first Roosevelt in office left me unable to set the book down. Beginning with TR's frail health as a child, Brands showed TR's innocent enthusiasms of American History, most notably his fascination with his \\"rebel\\" uncles that served the Confederacy in the Civil War. The love and devotion beset on him by his parents, mixed with no small quantity of favortism, had driven him to great lengths to develop not only his mind, but his frail health too. The Cuban campaign, thought \\"suicidal\\" his family, was what started and maintained to this day, his Rough Rider Image that we know is Teddy Roosevelt.<br />Brands gives a most astonishing account of TR's capacity for diaries. Most days of his life were astutely recorded, noting thoughts, feelings, ideas. The tragic account of the death of his first wife, then his second marriage to his childhood sweetheart, shows the heart of the man that marked the beginning of the twentieth century.<br />This book gives insightful detail to his brashness, his follies, and respect for office. He single-handedly created the nation of Panama (they were rebels) with the building of the Panama Canal, and tried to get the English Language re-written for the sake of easier spelling. Though serving 7 years in Presidential office, he was only elected once (he was McKinley's Vice President), and refused a re-election based on the fact he considered his first 3 years as rightfully his.<br />Ultimately this left me with what I thought was a greater understanding of his life, his traumas, his accomplishments. Politically he did much in the 20th century to help shape a political arena which in some ways still exist today. A must read for anyone reading about Presidential Biography, or 20th Century development.	2000-04-06

A little slow going with all the names that he throws out, it was riveting when he describes the encounters  with re-discovered black cousins. His expectations, their reservations  about him pursuing this topic made it terribly difficult for me to put the  book down at times. This will teach you about both the black and white  races; where we were, and where we're going. A must read.	2000-03-31

Though not usually my cup of tea (the book was a gift, I felt  obligated!) it did reveal the machinations of the Federal Machine, and how  you've got to do a little back rubbing for everyone to get anything done.  That fact that Clinton and his team did so almost masterfully made the book  worth reading right there. As with any President, or politician for that  matter, Clinton did fall on his face a sufficient number of times, whether  they were personal or political. His intelligence and charisma was artfully  brought through by the author in a most skillful way. A must read for  anyone trying to understand Clinton or his White House.	2000-03-31

Kennedy: An Investigation of Motive, Means, and Opportunity	Books	2	26	31	N	N	Somewhat Disappointing	My first adventure in investigative journalism, I was immediately captivated by the beginning: cast of characters, general overviews, and the excitement that, based on the overview of how the book was to go, it was  worth reading. The material was well written in that Mr. Moldea went into  fine and captivating detail asto what the investigators were thinking, what  EVERYONE was thinking. I was a little suspicious of the passage where he  describes visiting with Sirhan Sirhan, and given the result of the  encounter, maybe made the author a little biased asto how his investigation  would lead to. The ending left me in a completely different place, where I  believe the author's evidence lead me to. His conclusions were not anything  I had agreed with. I feel he made the evidence ultimately fit the official  version of the tragic downfall of RFK that fateful June evening in 1968.	2000-03-31
US	50065196	RXNOGODZYDCFT	0446603848	949850612	The Sins of the Father: Joseph P. Kennedy and the Dynasty He Founded	Books	5	74	78	N	N	The Kennedy Illusion	Kessler puts forth a most direct and cards-on-the-table account of Joseph as the patriarch and architect of today's most powerful political family. Its an interesting account of how Joe bullied his children to do as he wanted when he wanted; Joe Jr died in WWII, so he decided it was Jack that  was going into politics and become the first Catholic President of the  United States, something that Joe Sr had failed at. This book goes to  dispel the illusion effectively, and rightfully, that the Kennedy Clan was  a model family for the annals of American History. I highly recommend this  book to anyone remotely interested in the history of the Kennedy Clan.	2000-03-19

As a moderate Star Trek fan, I've found Leonard's own account of his life and career an accomplishment as no doubt he does as well. I especially found the story about the woman breaking into his hotel  to wear his clothes most amusing. I highly recommend it.	2000-03-19

The fantastic idea that the last czar of Russia escaped death, and the possibility that he died an old man after a long life is what drew me to this title. Though it was detailed about what was thought to have happened  that summer night in 1917, it seemed to lack substance about the man  himself. It also left me with a huge questionmark about the fate of the  Princess that also went missing: Anastasia. It was, however, interesting to  read about the conclusions of the handwriting samples, and pictures of  Vasily's children standing with pictures of the Romanovs. The old adage  &quot;The truth is stranger than fiction&quot; applies here. I still  recommend it.	2000-03-17

Once there Burns gives an account  of passionate dedication to the American people, both during the Depression  and WWII, that most likely was not seen since Lincoln. A must for anyone's  Presidential Biographical collection.	2000-03-17

It was also a treat discover that his influence is still seen (i.e. his newspaper, US Treasury)  even today. For anyone remotely interested in the founding of the United  States, starting here is a must.	2000-03-17
