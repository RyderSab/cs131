Since no one has any children yet at the earlier timeline, you're guaranteed a certain amount of survival from your protagonists (I always appreciate being able to relax at least a little!).<br />I had one false start with the book, reading about a quarter into it, then setting it aside when easier, blither books came my way.  I'm delighted I picked it up again (I re-read from the beginning) and have moved on to his most recent, which details the lives of the characters' great-great-great-great-great-great-grandparents (so if you like Cryptonomicon, do pick up the Quicksilver, it's exactly the same idiom).<br />Cryptonomicon's style is comparable to that of Dickens, in its skillful handling of numerous characters and subplots, to Tom Wolfe, in its exhaustive look at a particular subset of people at a particular time, to Victoria Holt (honestly) in its somewhat Gothic atmosphere and its sense that characters' acitivities can have implications down through generations, and to Eugene Sue, both for the well-handled theatrical sprawl and the intangible sense of purpose the characters convey.  A nifty book!<br />Note: a 3 star ranking from me means a pleasant enough read; 4 stars indicate a very enjoyable work; but I'll only give 5 stars to books that are or ought to be classic; sadly, most books published seem to warrant 2 or less ...

One can easily imagine further volumes, should McCammon decide to make his hero a recurring detective, and I'd look forward to them (I don't know of any circa 1700 detectives in New York, but it would be a fun read!)<br />Note: This is really about a 3 and a half starrer for me--a 3 star ranking from me is actually fairly good, I reserve 4 stars for tremendously good works, and 5 only for the rare few that are or ought to be classic; unfortunately most books published are 2 or less.	2004-04-26

What's good about this book is he doesn't patronize his audience with lengthy exposition regarding its historical setting, he expects his readers to be literate and well-educated; he has a whiz-bang opening to get you into his story (and it's needed, as the story drags in the middle of volume one, which essentially parades its whodunnit-style suspects before us); he's a graceful and articulate writer.<br />The characters could be a little more compelling, the emotional stakes a little higher, but it's a good read once you commit to it.  If you enjoy McCammon, you know you'll like this well enough--and if you've never read him, this isn't a bad place to begin; see if you like it, and know that greater delights await.<br />Note: a 3 star ranking from me is actually fairly good; I reserve 4 stars for tremendously good works, and 5 only for the rare few that are or ought to be classic; unfortunately most books published are 2 or less.	2004-04-16

But, I repeat, it isn't a cat book (I guess they thought that was their marketing hook).  <br />This is a fun, frothy fantasy, very light in tone (despite the presence of Hell in the basement), somewhat akin to Piers Anthony in his more tolerable incarnations.  It's angst-free urban fantasy--the plot is essentially episodic, as new interesting guests arrive at the hotel--and one can imagine it being a Warner Brothers TV hit, a neat cross between Faulty Towers and Bewitched, without becoming too &quot;twee.&quot;<br />If you want something a little more psychological dense, or consciously literate, Charles de Lint may be more your style.  But if you're in the mood to be playful, give Huff a chance to win you over.<br />Note: a 3 star ranking from me means a pleasant enough read; 4 stars indicate a very enjoyable work; but I'll only give 5 stars to books that are or ought to be classic; sadly, most books published seem to warrant 2 or less ...

This sequel to Black Easter (or second-half of a single work, if you prefer to look at it that way) is especially disappointing.  The first volume was brief, and ended just as things were about to get interesting ... which in this volume, they rather failed to do.<br />Here's the premise: God is dead, and Satan has taken over the earth.  The plot then consists of army officers in an underground bunker plotting an ineffective attack, alternating with scenes of Black Easter's protragonists discussing matters, then eventually travelling to Satan's stronghold without incident.<br />It seems almost incredible to me that given the plot outline (Satan takes over the world, magicians travel to his stronghold) nothing interesting happens--this must be intentional on the part of Blish, it's clearly a choice--so for anyone in the mood for a less lethargic novel, this will likely not satisfy.  It's Hell on Earth meets My Dinner with Andre, with duller conversations.<br />Note: a 3 star ranking from me is actually fairly good; I reserve 4 stars for tremendously good works, and 5 only for the rare few that are or ought to be classic; unfortunately most books published are 2 or less.	2004-04-14

There, that's it, that's the plot.  Nowadays (not that now is better, but we're used to Now) that would be the set-up to the plot ... the book ends just as things are about to get interesting.<br />There is a sequel, the Day After Judgement, which picks up immediately afterward but which also somewhat disappoints.<br />Another fault--well, not a fault necessarily, but certainly a less-engaging choice--is that the horrors one might expect in a book about black magic are entirely played offstage, and only referred to.  Imagine a Lord of the Rings with passages like &quot;two weeks later they decided to go through Moria, where Gandalf died, unfortunately, fighting a Balrog.  Still, with Lothlorien ahead, the Fellowship was somewhat optimistic.&quot;  It's not a good thing.<br />There is a demon fashion-show/parade near the end which is worth a chuckle, but it's still not scary.<br />Blish' A Case of Conscience is much more compelling reading, so go there instead--unless you're a completist, or in the mood for a brief, non-unnerving look at the dark arts, circa 1967.<br />Note: a 3 star ranking from me is actually fairly good; I reserve 4 stars for tremendously good works, and 5 only for the rare few that are or ought to be classic; unfortunately most books published are 2 or less.	2004-04-14

If you're a Buffy fan, you'll recognize the pacing ... this would cover five or six episodes, with the seasonal &quot;arc&quot; only occasionally coming to the fore.<br />Very refreshing to have a protagonist (well, one of the two) whose skill with a sword is not necessarily as important as his acting ability.  Really, the whole book was a charmer (slightly reminiscent of Kage Baker's Anvils of the World, but less precious, more grounded).<br />If you like your secondary world fantasies pleasant and light without being flippant, engrossing without being fast-paced, and well-written (but not over-written), give this one a look.<br />Note: 4 stars from me is high praise for a thoroughly good book. Only classics (or those which ought to be) get 5 stars, 3 stars is for an enjoyable book.  Most books, sadly, seem to merit 2 or less.	2004-04-13

This book is like a roller-coaster ride that has sections of track missing (intentionally) so that you unexpectedly plummet to new portions of track.  It's dizzying in the best sense of the world.<br />It begins in a future (note: not THE future) with museum-worker Will discovering an odd discrepancy in a Victorian painting.  I dare go no further in describing the plot, but it's hilarious, exciting, inventive, unexpected, and fresher than a new coat of apple-green paint.  I loved it.<br />Warning: I was very distressed early on over a plotpoint (you'll know what I mean), but don't let it stop you--in this book, plotpoints are made to be broken ... it is about time travel, after all.<br />This is a sparkling, marvellous book.  It's only my second Rankin (I read Hollow Chocolate Bunnies first) so I come to him with a neophyte's enthusiasm that will hopefully remain undimmed with time.<br />Note: a 3 star ranking from me is actually pretty good; I reserve 4 stars for tremendously good works, and 5 only for the rare few that are or ought to be classic; unfortunately most books published are 2 or less.	2004-04-13

In this follow-up, Berg manipulates events to land our hero in the same situation as the first--again he is a slave, again he is tortured, and again he saves the day in exactly the same manner as in the first novel.<br />Like the first, it is unrelentingly serious, and the female characters are more compelling than the male, though less in the forefront. Both books are longer than need be; there is less plot than a book its size would warrant, and the writing is pleasant but not brilliant. (I think its size is a case of too many incidents to illustrate the same point).<br />Would you like it?  It's certainly immersive, and if you read the first and very much enjoyed the protagonist, you may be inclined to continue his adventures.  If you didn't really care for the first, well, this isn't a case of a stunning second novel marking a great advance upon a first, they're both of a piece.<br />Note: a 3 star ranking from me is actually pretty good; I reserve 4 stars for tremendously good works, and 5 only for the rare few that are or ought to be classic; unfortunately most books published are 2 or less.	2004-03-25

There are several very cute passages.<br />An excellent book (my first read of this author's oeuvre) and I'm looking forward to reading more from him (he's written a lot!)<br />Note: a 3 star ranking from me is actually pretty good; I reserve 4 stars for tremendously good works, and 5 only for the rare few that are or ought to be classic; unfortunately most books published are 2 or less.	2004-03-25

The ending was satisfying and unexpected.  <br />It wasn't especially comic, despite the opportunities and occasional suspected effort, and it wasn't particularly moving.

But this is a traditional secondary-world fantasy, with all its trappings (different races of beings with different abilities, magic, oddly-named characters and locations, a quest, unlikely friendships, etc.)<br />It's really a three-and-a-half starrer for me (still good) but without that option, I gave it the benefit of the doubt.  It certainly grabbed me and held my attention while reading.  It's better than the second volume, which manipulates events to land our hero in the same situation as the first (the poor fellow is prone to torture--in the unwritten backstory before the first book, in the first book, and in the second book--haven't read the third yet.  Nor is this casual torture, he's driven to amnesia/madness/loss of identity each time.  It's a little sadistic, but not so bad as in that notorious Terry Goodkind novel)<br />It is also almost unrelentingly serious, with only a little humour in it (but welcome, whenever it came), and the women characters are more compelling than the male, though less in the forefront.  I think it's longer than it need be; there is less plot than a book its size would warrant, and the writing is pleasant but not brilliant.

The sci-fi components are more fi than sci, so it's not really worth reading if that's your sole interest in this book.<br />The characters are well-drawn and differentiated, the plot's constantly absorbing, the satire on Victorian England astonishingly clever, and it's really quite moving as well.

The protagonist is an archivist, forced into hero-ness after all the previous, better-suited heroes had failed at their task.  The story is suprising, exceedingly well-written, and the subsequent two novels do not disappoint.<br />Please, read it.

Few authors are able to find their balance between great writing, engaging plots, memorable characters, yada yada yada, but Bradley has it hands down.  <br />It's a good book.  It's fun.  It's exciting.  It doesn't talk down to you.  It's like Dickens, with magic, and fewer first-person descriptions of weather.  <br />Oh, what's the use--go read the first book.

That's it for plot.  If you're looking for a book to read to your kids during commercial breaks in American Idol, this is the one, and you'll be finished before Mr. Seacrest reveals who's been booted off today.<br />If you enjoy lots of pictures, stories that are so minimal a stick of butter wouldn't have trouble following the plot, and insist on semi-fantastic content, this is your book.

The illustrations are the best part of it, and the story has so many of them, and so few words, that it's more a picture book than a novel (or part of a novel), despite its tone being a little mature for those for whom a picture book would be appropriate.<br />Essentially nothing happens, which would be all right if it didn't happen in an entertaining and well-written manner, but I'm sorry, in this case things fail to happen in a pedestrian way.<br />It seems that magical beings may be in-and-or-around the new home of our three undeveloped (save for character tics--one fences, one collects animals) main characters.  When they finally meet one near the end of the volume (you knew this would happen eventually, but the characters shouldn't be as knowing) they react with such little surprise, such lack of wonder, that any residual hope I had for the story quite withered away.<br />(I read the second one and though slightly more filled with incident, it was no better written.)<br />For weird houses with secrets, turn to John Bellairs.  For encounters with strange magical creatures, go to E. Nesbit, or one of dozens of others much, much more enjoyable.<br />Note: a 3 star ranking from me is actually pretty good; I reserve 4 stars for tremendously good works, and 5 only for the rare few that are or ought to be classic; unfortunately most books published are 2 or less.	2004-02-24

Her account of the garden they made despite each other is one of the great triumphs of the &quot;garden memoir&quot; genre, and vastly more interesting than most such works.<br />The book is haunted by the presence of Walter, and his likes and dislikes, and right ways and wrong ways to do anything.  You can't help but feel Mrs Fish must have breathed the world's biggest sigh of relief at his passing, since it finally allowed her to get on with her gardening.<br />Here's a sample: Walter would smother her seedlings by putting too much manure around HIS roses, he decorated the outbuildings with bought mounted animal trophy heads (until they rotted), and he would stand guard over his wife while she planted dahlias to ensure she did so 'correctly.'<br />Not to be missed!  (And for others in the just-as-absorbing-when-not-about-the-garden books, you must turn to Beverley Nichols and any of his brilliantly charming works about house or garden).<br />Note: a 3 star ranking from me is actually pretty good; I reserve 4 stars for tremendously good works, and 5 only for the rare few that are or ought to be classic; unfortunately most books published are 2 or less.	2004-02-24

It's actually the book that convinced me to try the first--I saw this for sale, it looked very engaging, but realising it was the third in the series I found Lady in Gil and sat down to read it, and seem to remember finishing it that evening as it was too wonderful for words.<br />I love Connie Willis (well, her better work, at least), and I love Mervyn Peake.

It unfolds with a slightly faster pace than these, but with a very similar tone (and the author knows  it, and drops teensy references every so often.)<br />The nearest comparison I  can make is to MacDonald's &quot;Lilith&quot; and &quot;Phantastes&quot;;  if you've read these you'll know how different they are from the  slash-and-quest style fantasy.  If you're a huge fan of slash-and-quest,  avoid this at all costs.<br />The philosophizing is kept to a minimum, and the  (should I say sketchy) &quot;theology&quot; or explanation for the House  leads one to expect further delineation in later volumes--it doesn't  matter, though ... the house simply is, and that's enough.<br />Stoddard's  work is kept from 5 stardom only by a certain repetition of incident as the  novel progressed; a tighter plotline would be more absorbing.	2000-05-12

This first book sets the pattern:  wealthy,  intellectually-pretentious, English housewife Lucia wants to be thought of  as the exemplar of good/interesting taste, and will stop at nothing to  achieve her goal.
