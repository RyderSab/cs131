This time, she is accompanied by a young, long haired, sexy man to help her track down the missing toy maker. Although, he's not quite human, we think, and neither are the toy maker or the cookie maker. Full of fun and 'bah, hum-bug's I think you will love this mini-novel! Somewhere along the way of fighting off mean, little elves and trying to deal with her sister's surprise, Stephanie has forgotten all about Christmas. Now, four days before the big day and Stephanie has no tree, no presents, and no spirit. And everytime she DOES try and get a Christmas tree, the poor pine is always doomed for a violent death. Full of fun surprises and adventure, I really enjoyed this novel about Christmas in 'The Berg.\\" Because, I mean, let's face it, sometimes Christmas does take on a supernatural feeling of its own!	2002-11-19

First off, I have read this whole series and I must say that I absolutely love her!! From the first time we were introduced to Penelope and Colin, I loved them. Colin was my favorite Bridgerton and Penelope was my favorite friend on the &quot;side.&quot; So, deep down, I really wanted to see Penelope with a Bridgerton and Colin with a neat person. So, you can imagine how delighted I was to see these two in their own book!! Although, I admit, I was a little disappointed because I thought there should be more substance in this story. I thought Anthony and Daphne's stories were so much more fun. But this one was great, too. I highly recommend anyone to read this series if you love a funny, light hearted fun read!! Julia Quinn is wonderful!! My favorite, actually!! I find myself counting down to the date of her next book release. I just love her.	2002-10-22

I thought this was a fun read with great characters and wonderful secondary characters. One of my favorite things about Ms. Stuart is that she always focuses a lot on the extra people in her stories, the neighbors, the sister or brother, the friends. It is such a neat thing and most authors I have read do not do that. In this book, Marielle is a widow gone to live in a &quot;haunted&quot; apartment building. That is where she meets Simon, the somewhat &quot;acting&quot; landlord. And while they continue to fight their feelings for one another, they become best friends. And Marielle finds that the eccentric people living in the building are just as friendly and special and she begins to form strong bonds with them as well. And meanwhile, strange things are happening around the house and one of the psychics in the house performs a seance and Marielle has a minor meeting with a spirit. Or does she?? I highly recommend this book. It is fun and different and I think you'll love it!	2002-02-19

When I was finally able to, I could not put it down...naturally. I absolutely love the Bridgerton family from the youngest daughter to the oldest son and the wonderful mother of the 7 children. Benedict Bridgerton is thirty years old and should be ready to marry. However, he has yet to meet someone in which he is compelled to marry...until he meets a mystery woman in silver. But at the strike of midnight, she is gone...and he is merely left with a glove that has unknown initials sewn into it. Two years later, Benedict saves a young servant woman who is about to be attacked by some drunk young men and offers her a job in his mother's home. Little does he know that she is his woman in silver two years prior having escaped from her step mother and step sisters' evil wrath. And suddenly, a strong friendship bonds these two together, though she is hiding her past in the shadows. But she can only hide it for so long. I love this series and I cannot wait until the 4th one comes out this year. I am waiting...ever...so...patiently.	2002-02-04

Seems like this book was a bit out of the ordinary for her and so I was EXTREMELY impressed. The book was, basically, the diary of a psychotic man and his obsession with wanting to make himself a 'Zombie' of his own. Someone to be his mindless male sex God. This book was chilling and it made you angry and sad and quite emotional. 'Zombie' gets right into the head of a serial killer and his thoughts and his dimentia. I was very impressed. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because the ending was kind-a dissappointing. I know, I know, call me old fashioned, call me boring, but when did he get his??? He deserved it for the horrible crimes he committed, but he did not. I dunno, add a little scene where he gets tortured or raped as deserved, and I definitely would have given it 5 stars.	2002-02-04

This was the first Kellerman book I have ever read but after doing so, I would read another one with Dr. Delaware. He's a smart character and I am totally enthralled with psychological thrillers. This was a good one. I have read better, I must say, but Mr. Kellerman did a great job keeping me interested and coming up with my own theories. I have to agree, though, that Milo being a top detective, was not very...I dunno what the word is...quick thinking. As far as theories and stuff go. But, it is just a book, I must remember, and I will read another one of this series eventually. So, for a thought provoking book with many psychologically damaged characters and a smart doctor, read this book. I doubt you'll be too dissappointed.	2002-01-31

When I first read one of her books, Diamond Girl, I was hooked. The second and third ones, After the Music and Passion Flower, I thought were great! Then...I read Once in Paris and I had to force myself to finish it. So, I tried again and read this one. Major disappointment. What is happening to the wonderulf novels I have read before? Perhaps, she is running out of material. Although, I do not know in what order she wrote these books, so maybe she is getting BETTER before she is getting...not so good. For anyone who wants to read a Diana Palmer book, I recommend you start with a different one, perhaps one of the books I mentioned above. 'Fit For A King' is somewhat slow and lacking in excitement and reality. I like the main character for she is a strong independant woman, but only to a point. I can't really give you a synopsis of the story because if you have read one by Diana Palmer, than you have read this one, too. But...I am NOT giving up on her. I will try and try again!!	2002-01-15

Although I read this book AFTER it's 2nd part of the series (The Viscount Who Loved Me), I thought it was wonderful!! The characters are so rich and full of life and so....REAL. All of Daphne's brothers are so typically male and yet so charming. And Daphne is a 100% spitfire head strong woman. She is great! It is time for her to find a husband but she refuses to marry without the breathtaking love she knows truley does exist. So, avoiding a number of friendly marriage offers, she has a little run in with one of her brothers' friends. His name is Simon and he is just like his brothers and therefore they want him to have nothing to do with their Daphne. But Daphne is independant and smart and so Simon and Daphne have a plan. They will make everyone think they are an item when in reality, it is a ploy to get everyone off their backs about marriage. So much fun, this book is full of laughs and strength, and Daphne's family is wonderful!! Julia Quinn is fabulous. You will not be disappointed in this book and I vow to read every part of this series as the members of this charming family live their individual lives.	2001-09-17

I am a huge John Saul fan and after reading a number of his books, I always favored Second Child, the first book I ever read by him, the most. And then, this book came along and REALLY had me deciding which one I liked better. It was fabulous! Most of John Saul's books are of released evil or multiple personalities or something of that nature. This one was not. The God Project was more like something that, after much research and some very intellegent (not to mention psychologically damaged) scientists and doctors can get together and &quot;toy&quot; with peoples' DNA and so forth...affecting future off spring, causing them to become....basically, super human. It was quite the chiller and I could not put it down. I was up all night reading and I could not put the book down until I had finished. If you have never read a John Saul book, this would be a great one to start with. If you are already a John Saul reader, don't forget to squeeze this one in there! You won't be disappointed.	2001-09-10

I heard nothing but great stuff about this book and about Lori Herter. My sister had read her vampire series. Anyway, when I read The Willow File, I was a little disappointed. The plot was fabulous. A ghost is haunting Arianne and it turns out to be Willow, her great, great aunt. Willow died mysteriously many years ago, her lover accused of murder by throwing her into the sea. Her lover is Ross's grandfather and so brings us to Ross and Arianne and their extreme attraction to one another, though the families are life long rivals. So, the bad parts of this book, well, those are the characters. They are weak and pathetic and sickening. Ross is so hung up on his family name and so immature I just want to rip out my hair. And Arianne is weak and frail and she just does not seem very smart. If this plot wasn't so good, this book would get a mere star from me and that is being generous.	2001-09-10
US	51139782	R1OI1CN1FHQEZJ	1551668556	66831105	The Charm School	Books	4	2	2	N	N	Fun and enlightening	I thought this book was a fun and smooth read. It is about a young woman named Isadora who hides her beauty behind big glasses and straggly hair but has a huge heart. She is smart and funny but her confidence lacks so no one really gets the chance to see the real her shine through. Almost forgotten and ignored by her family (she is the &quot;ugly duckling&quot; of the family), and her heart belonging to a young man who does not even know she exists, she sees an opportunity to leave for a little while and she grabs it. She gets on a ship with a man named Ryan and his crew (whom, I might had, really make this book a lot more fun) and off she goes to be the ship's translator. Though, womanizing Ryan is completely against the thought of a woman on his ship, his boss agrees and lets Isadora on as long as she is his &quot;spy&quot; to make sure Ryan stays in line. Slowly, you will find Isadora's confidence grow and the real her is revealed. She is strong and witty and just an altogether neat character. And Ryan is likeable and funny and the two of them together is great. I highly recommend this book to anyone looking for a feel-good fun adventure.	2001-09-05

Here I am, just finishing and still recovering from lack of sleep for all the time I put in to finishing this book!! I was nervous and chilled as well as angry at times and I even found a few humerous parts. And I love the way our dear Mr. Saul would throw characters from his other books in there. This book is basically about the past of the  Insane Asylum and the horrible things that went on and the evil doctor that ran the place. Now, years later, they want to conserve it and a mystery gifts start popping up...as well as a little added evil.	2001-07-23

I could hardly put it down, but it was not so much because it was irresistable or that it kept you at the edge of your seat. It was just because I wanted to see what would happen, I wanted to know what the characters were thinking, what they were going through. It is a great book to read that gets in the minds and feelings of the characters involved. There is a married couple with a small, very smart son. Living next to them is an old woman whose teenage granddaughter comes to stay with her. And it tells how these families' lives entertwine over approximately a two year period. It is a good book, though somewhat startling at times. I have to agree that this is a good summer read.	2001-07-20

It is the perfect book to read when you feel as though fate and destiny have left you out of their plans and you are giving up on finding your soul mate. I read this book in about 2 days and it was such an easy, smooth read. For a first novel, I was very impressed and the author, writing about her self basically, is witty and some of the things she says I can totally relate to, or I have felt myself. Though I have not read Bridget Jones' Diary {I saw the movie!! :)} I can see how the two books would be similar. I highly recommend this book about a woman trying to find herself. She has a good relationship with her family but her counselor just...I dunno. I did not like her at all. I think I could have done a better job than that!! Anyway...it is a woman's struggle for independance (and being okai with it), love, and what she wants to do with her life. At 29, she feels she should already know. I really enjoyed this book and I highly recommend it.	2001-07-10

I have a mission in my life to read every one of the boooks she has ever written. And I have read quite a few. But so far, I think this is the least likeable one. I have never read an author that can do better Historical Romance than Anne Stuart. She is brilliant. So, when I read this I was expecting something great. I will admit I was a tad bit disappointed. The main characters were somewhat weak and frail, though the story line was good. And the mystery behing the truth was great...the surprise ending was splendid. Leave it to Anne Stuart to make great surprise endings in anything she writes. But all in all, this book kind of dissapointed me. It was so hard to get into from the beginning that I had to force myself to keep going. I was glad I did, though, because the ending was good and the solved mystery was good...with a few last minute added mysteries of its own. I guess in the long run, this was not Anne Stuart material. I know she could have done better, and she has! But as you can see from the other reviews, everyone loved this book. Do not let mine discourage your need to read this novel, for I could be the reason I did not like this so much...it could just be me. :)	2001-06-11

When I got this book, I was under the impression that it would involve the sisters' relationship a little more than it did. The book was fast paced and humerous but lacking in...something. I dunno. And it was sort of weak, not much of a mystery-no surprise ending or surprise additions, it was basically predictable. Maybe it lacked reality a little, the way Deborah was trying to solve the case and the police were getting tips from HER. The book was well written and a quick read, but it just seemed to have nothing to do with the sister-sister relationship. And to be honest, if my sister acted the way Sharon did, and said the things she said, I would not want to talk to her either...ever. And in like the last chapter she decided to be nice, though she seemed to only be in a total of 5 chapters or something. I dunno. If you're looking for a very funny, quick mystery read, try Janet Evanovich. You'll love her!	2001-06-06

This has got to be one of the best books I have ever read...and I have read a LOT of books. The characters in this book are smart and witty and the complete opposite of boring. I tell you, Julia Quinn is wonderful!! Even the secondary characters light up each page. This is not your regular historical romance, it is something entirely in its own characterization. I have never read a book that has made me laugh out loud like this one. And I NEVER laugh out loud at books. Smile, sure, but laugh? Never. Until now. Kate is bound and determined to make sure her younger half sister Edwina marries someone that deserves her. Edwina is smart and funny and has the biggest heart, and Kate must monitor all those that court her sister. Anthony is a rake, and he decides it is time to get married and have a family...with someone smart, beautiful, and someone he is sure he will never love. So, when he hears of Edwina, he decides already to court and marry her....but Kate says over her dead body. Even Anthony has a charming brother named Colin whom I would LOVE to read more about, and a wonderful high spirited sister named Daphne. No evil people in this book out to get them, no murder or mayhem...just undeniable attraction and unlikely love matches. The cover of this book makes it sound like Kate is out and ready to steal Edwina's love. But please know, that is NOT at all how it is. Very far from it actually. Just a splendid book with splendid characters and I was sad to see it come to an end. READ THIS!! You MUST!!	2001-06-04

However, I had no idea it would be this...I dunno...different. I loved it, it was a splendid read but the curse Catherine suffered from was nothing I had expected. And usually, I do not go for this type of book. But, I loved this one. It was wonderful. Catherine and Nicholas were great characters, a great couple, and it took them awhile to fall in love, which I thought was neat. They did not just fall all over themselves right off, though there was quite an attraction. Fight after fight, a LOT of mistrust, and much time later, when Nicholas learns of Catherine's curse, he is patient and mild and I thought that was wonderful. Though she denied it time and again, he still kept his patience and strived to understand her. I highly recommend this book if you are ready for a different kind of romance-one with humor, twists and turns, and a tad bit of mystery. With great secondary characters (except that spoiled, snotty little brat Nicholas was originally going to marry) and main characters that are not easy to forget, a plot with a twist, and a charming feline, you will find a fun, out-of-the-norm read!	2001-05-31

Lauren was a little stuffy at first, but she starts to grow on you as you realize that she is just insecure and scared about cutting lose, relaxing and taking even simple risks. And Max is wonderful from the start, though I think he had a little problem forgetting the odd \\"moment\\" he and Lauren shared in the past.

A heartwarming...and yet heartbreaking story about a young love shared between two wonderful people, Allison and Noah. Though their time together was limited at their young age, their love was stronger then even some of the lovers that had been together for many years. Torn apart by Allison's mother, these two had to go their separate ways. For years, Noah would send Allison letters and they were letters she never received. So, they lived their seprate lives. Then, some years later, Allison is engaged to marry a rich and stable man with a big heart and Noah is living alone on an old farm house with his wonderful dog. Accidentally coming across an article in the paper about the house Noah lives in and the way he restored it, Allison is overwhelmed with the temptation to pay him a surprise visit and see how he is and who he has become. And from there, this becomes a beautiful love story and Allison must decide whether to follow her heart or her mind.  I read this book while I was on vacation and I could not put it down. If you have given up on love or are pretty close to doing so, or even if you have never felt such a strong love before, this is the perfect book of love and loss. It makes you wish you could fall desperately in love with someone, or it makes you thankful that you have fallen desperately in love. It just goes to show how beautiful love can really be and that there really is true love out there among us.	2001-05-29

In this episode of the life of Stephanie Plumb, bounty hunter, we get to be introduced to a new character added to her short list of friends. Sally, a male cross dresser with much style and no grace helps Stephanie with the codes that are thrown at her when she is put on a new case. She must find Maxine, a small town waitress but a seemingly easy search turns out to be a web of mystery and a treasure hunt involving Maxine's ex-slime ball boyfriend.

So, with the help of Lula, her almost fearless friend, they must get to Maxine before Joyce does.

It is a beautiful love story with some challenges and two wonderful, huge-hearted characters. Madeline, so sensible, with her gentle heart and soul and willingness to accept the theory of the Bride Finder, though she finds it a bit odd. Anatole, his haunting past and pent up pain of many years and strife to accept his life as abnormal as it is. And add a little mystery, a haunted castle, enemies of the past, maybe a little super natural, some magic, and two wonderful main characters and you have one of the most unforgettable books you can read. It is wonderful. It will stay with you way after you have finished and closed the book. The extra characters and residents of this castle, along with Anatole's male family members, add a little something great to this book. I highly recommend this story of Anatole and Madeline to anyone who is ready for a heart breaking, exciting, magical novel about love, the power to find true love and keep it, and accepting and believing in magic, sacrifice, and fate. And now, I cannot wait to find the second book in this series.	2001-04-16

It is more about the life of a woman that had to struggle for her independance and the way she survived her youth, college life, and becoming content with who she is. I guess it could have been based a little more on life with her sister, but maybe that was not Ms. Fox's intention in the first place. All in all, the writing in this was great, it made you smile, it made you sad. It was a nice, relaxing book. The characters were bright and so real.

It is about a very strong young woman, Lillian, who was once in love with a man, William, that her father forbade her to marry. At that he, married someone else and she was betrothed to Corbett. Then something happens and a battle breaks out and Corbett's father and Lillian's cousin are killed fighting against each other. At that, Lillian leaves town. Upon her return three years later, to attend her two sisters' weddings, her father is very ill and his castle is to be left in the hands of Lillian's sister and brother-in-law when he dies if Lillian does not marry. Her father does not want this for he wants his home to be left in the hands of his oldest daughter Lillian. And Corbett needs Lillian to be his bride so he can have possession of both places. At that, he pays her father a visit and, in result, she is once again betrothed to him. And she hates him for she blames him for the death of her cousin. From there, this book is full of heartache, happiness, anger, loss, mistrust, and jealousy. I highly recommend it. It is one of the best Historical Romance books I have ever read.

I struggled through the middle. Everything that happened at the end could have happened sooner and spared us a big, boring part of the book. Starting this book, I had mixed feelings as it was about the author. I had read a real BAD book by him and an outstanding book by him. So, I was going to try this one. I was disappointed. If you are looking for a real thrill ride or scare book, read Intensity. It will blow your mind.	2001-04-02
US	51139782	R2LKLI5Y1A9VYR	0553563343	755856344	Breath of Magic	Books	5	3	3	N	N	Enchanting!	This is about a gentle witch that is still new to her powers and she gets thrown into the 90's, where she lands at the feet of Tristan, a millionaire. And it just so happens Tristan is searching for someone to show him that real magic does exist. This book has its funny parts, sad parts, heart warming and heart wrenching parts. It makes you angry and it makes you happy. It is full of emotion. At first, I thought Tristan was a real jerk. He was mean to her and impatient and somewhat cold hearted. And Arian was sweet and naive and had the biggest heart possible. But as the book went on, I strived to understand his point of view (though I still think he was too cruel at times.)  The characters are rich and full of life, and I absolutely adored Trenton's body guard and his best friend. They added a little something to the book and made it more enjoyable. I highly recommend this book to anyone that has a belief in magic, whether in a physical sense, or just from the heart.	2001-03-27

Stephanie has had her car repossessed, her phone turned off, she's living off donated fig newtons, and she is just about to be evicted. She has pawned off everything she owns...her VCR, lamps, you name it. And she is desperate. So, she runs to her cousin Vinnie, who runs a bounty hunting operation, and black males him into letting her take one of his cases. So, she chooses the case about a man accused of murder because when...or IF she tracks him down, she will then get $10,000. Pretty simple, hu? Nope. He turns out to be the sexy charmer that took her virginity when they were kids. And he still has that effect on her after all these years! So...the chase is on. I thought this book was a lot of fun. I breezed right through it and it thoroughly enjoyed it. I really enjoyed watching this poor girl strive to gain respect and the money she needs to get her life back in order, and all the extra characters that pop up. She is silly, witty, strong minded, vengeful, and just a blast. I recommend this book to anyone! Romance lovers, adventure lovers, mystery lovers. Even thriller lovers. You will NOT be disappointed!! I am ready to start the second book to the Stephanie Plumb series. Can't wait!	2001-03-21

It is about Drake, a young boy who falls in love with a young game-playing girl whose younger sister, Raven, is secretly in love with him. He plans to elope with Raven's sister, but the girl's father finds out and stops them from eloping. Drake blames Raven, ignoring her pleas of innocence and he is banned from the town. 12 years later, he is back, as a powerful knight, ready to fight for money. And that is where he finds Raven, all grown up and beautiful, betrothed to his hateful and viscious enemy. I cannot tell you anything else. I thought this book was an adventurous read, once in awhile causing you to hold your breath. The chracters are radiant, even the loyal friends of Drake light up the pages. This was my first Connie Mason book, and I was not disappointed.	2001-03-20

Julia and Octavia are cousins, Julia being tall, rich, slender and beautiful while Octavia is plump, poor, and somewhat homely. But the two cousins have huge hearts and they are wonderful. Julia is ready to accept the marriage proposal of a wealthy and suitable caring, young man until she falls in love with Octavia's best friend, a poor young man with not much to offer but his love. Well, when Julia's parents find out how she feels, they forbid her to see him and send her off to stay at a house far away and they send Octavia with her. From there, the light romance starts as they run into smugglers and have an adventure of their own. All the while, Julia is striving to push away the feelings she has for her beloved but she is just too true to her heart. Octavia comes out of her shell and starts to be the charming young woman she has kept hidden. But soon, things will start to fall into place. I recommend this book as a great vacation read. It is quite unlike any book I think I have ever read and I loved every minute of it.	2001-03-07

He does not agree with marriage nor does he believe in love. When he can take it no longer and must marry so that he might be left alone, he hears of a sick, young woman not supposed to survive through the night. Well, while she is on her death bed and unconscious, he marries her. By morning, Leah, his bride, is quite a chipper little thing, and quite healed at that. So, she makes him a deal that she will keep his action secret if he will pretend to be happily married just until her younger sister finds a suitable man and marries him. So, he agrees. And from there is where it all starts. I really liked the characters in this book, and they were silly and enjoyable. Leah is not your ordinary wimpy lady of that time. She is smart and funny and she writes these cute children's books as she herself, though denying it, wishes for a true love of her own. The people of Adrian's home, the cook, the butler, the gardener, are also quite enjoyable. I recommend this book as an easy, very enjoyable weekend read.	2001-03-05

It was a funny, heart warming and yet heart wrenching romantic adventure. I loved it!! It is about a young widow named Julianna, who, after her cold husband of ten years passes away, is sent to stay with her mother whom she has not seen since her marriage. She was sent away when she was 11 to marry the older man and since then has not been able to completely forgive her mother. Well, now her mother (also a widow) is to be remarried and the King has sent Nicholas, a jester, as a temporary wedding gift. However, Nicholas is REALLY sent to steal a precious chalice from Julianna's step father-to-be and has no idea what he is about to get himself into. The characters in this book are rich and full of life. I absolutely adored Julianna and Nicholas. Even at his worse, Nicholas was a splendid character. Full of adventure and fun and romance, I highly recommend this book. After having read several of Anne Stuart's books, I believe this one comes very, very close to being her best yet. So, anyone with a liking for romances with a twist and charming characters should definitely pick this book up!! It is one you are not likely to forget for quite some time.	2001-02-27
US	51139782	R29BLRCN9L2G4L	1551664704	298085509	Once In Paris	Books	2	1	3	N	N	Surprisingly disappointing	First, I just want to say that I love Diana Palmer. She is fabulous and fun, one of my favorites. This book was NOT Diana Palmer material. It is about a young girl who falls in love with an older man and waits a year for him until he over comes his wife's death. In the meantime, Brianne's horrible step father promises her hand in marriage to someone else and Brianne will do everything she can to keep from marrying this evil man, with the help of Peirce if he gets over his wife's death. I could hardly stand Pierce for he was boring, self centered and childish. And though Brianne was not as naive as one would think, she was still not a very bright young woman. I found the plot somewhat weak, even though Ms. Palmer snuck in a few surprises with the oil companies and wars and etc. I found Tate Winthrop more exciting than anyone in this book and he was hardly in it!! I know the next book I read by her will be much better. I am not giving up on her!  :)	2001-02-26

However, there seemed to be something missing. The characters were wonderful, and if it was not for their fire and spirit, this book would not have been as enjoyable. Maybe it was the lack of reality that got me hesitating on mores stars for this book, I do not know. There was just something missing.  The main characters were fabulous. The book was about a bounty hunter that &quot;catches&quot; the wrong twin. Though she tries to explain to him who she really is, he dismisses it. The book is basically about their love hate relationship as they run into many different hardships and challenges. Meanwhile, her sister and her sister's boyfriend are out trying to rescue her from the bounty hunter. Every character in this book is charming and spirited and that is good enough reason to read it. I really LOVED 'Be My Baby' but this book would be a good novel with a laugh or two if you are in the mood for some crazy twists and turns and some outrageous chracters.	2001-02-20
US	51139782	R2MK3YCVV7V99M	1575663945	870472751	Dark Of The Moon	Books	5	2	2	N	N	Fabulous!!	I am not one to ever read mysteries. As a matter of fact, I avoid them. But after reading the cover of this one, I had to buy it. I was NOT dissappointed a single bit about the book. It was wonderful. Very emotional and bone chilling. Sure, there was a lot of drama but I guess that is what makes this type of book so good. I fell in love with the main character, Louis Kincaid, the deputy that is assigned to solve a murder mystery of a young black man that was brutally murdered approximately 20 years prior. He is in a Southern state and they still hold some prejudice there, so basically, he has limited information given to him and limited help from the citizens that know more then they will let on. With a lot of twists and turns, the book keeps you guessing. There are parts that really make you mad and you just want to throw the book across the room, but there are also heart touching parts as well. A very good book with a great plot and characters that you either hate or you love. I highly recommend this book to anyone that loves murder mysteries. I avoid those books and I absolutely loved this one!	2001-02-16

It was romantic and fun and heart warming and heart breaking all at once. It was great, full of adventure. I highly recommend this to anyone that enjoys reading adventure romances with a twist of danger and such appealing characters. Ethan and Josie are fabulous. Josie is not the withering little baby you usually get in romance novels, she is strong and quick and a regular heroin herself. A great book, a better romance then I have read in a very long time.	2001-02-12

It is about two sisters that are very strong and independant women and their fight to find themselves and the happiness they lack. The book covers the relationship between the two women, their fight to be &quot;friends&quot; again and the struggle of having their hearts broken at the same time. It is so good. I guess because I have a sister that is also my best friend, it was most enjoyable, for the bonding the sisters have is so heart warming. Though they are not always getting along, they still love each other very much and would do almost anything for one another. Though the plot is a little slow, I would not say it is boring, just relaxing. I would recommend this book as a great vacation read, especially to someone that thinks the female bond is an important thing.	2001-02-05

When I read about it, I immediately went on a search to buy it and when I was finally able to read it, it was not as good as I had predicted. It was still a very good book to read though. It is about a woman that just turns 40 and she is alone, not real happy, and she has a few minor issues. As the book goes on, you read how she learns to love herself, and what she does to make herself feel better about herself. She is a very likeable character and her friends just help to make this book complete. It is a good, relaxing novel that I highly recommend to anyone that is looking for just that. And in a strange way, it gives you just a little bit of hope that everything is going to be okai in your own life, even though it may not seem like it.	2001-01-22

Some parts were a little slow, but the plot and fun entertainment in other parts made up for what was lacking. It is about a shy school teacher who seeks the exciting life only to win back her fiance that left her for a glamourous singer. So, in doing so, she meets up with a magician who hires her to help with his acts. And you'll have to read the book to find out what happens after. It is a very good book, full of dangerous fun and I recommend it to anyone that believes in a little magic...or even for those that don't.	2001-01-19
US	51139782	R2DFKYG43FH7JK	0312154712	484418071	An Act of Love	Books	2	0	2	N	N	Slow but realistic	I guess when things like this happen, this is probably a pretty close comparison as to how it is handled. The book was easy to read and the writing style was decent, maybe a bit juvenile. It is about a high school girl who suddenly tries to commit suicide and then claims the reason is because she was raped by her step brother. He denies any such thing. The book keeps you debating about who is telling the truth and who is lieing and how the parents handle the ordeal. It was a disappointment though here and there the author will throw in a little surprise. The parents were boring and somewhat lame at times, as is most of the book anyway. But I guess if you want a laid back, easy to read book, this is a good choice.	2000-12-11

It is heart warming and so much fun. Three angels are sent on different assignments to help bring back the spirit of Christmas and add a little bit of &quot;guidance&quot; of their own to some much-needed families and individuals. It involves a bitter divorced woman and her 12 year-old daughter, a young man about to marry someone that just might not be the one, and a sad church minister still grieving the death of his beloved wife from three years ago who has lost all his religious faith. I highly recommend this book to anyone ready for a good Christmas novel to help get you back in the holiday spirit.	2000-12-08

I completely respected the strength of the main character, Jennifer, as she strived to get back on her feet again and become the career woman she once was. And at the beginng, I loved Rett, the main male chracter, but as the story went on, I start to disrespect Rett because he was self centered and almost cruel.  By the end, however, watching him grovel was fabulous. The book itself seemed to be missing something, though, as if the author was side tracked or in a hurry or something. I dunno. I guess I was a little disappointed in Rett. However, this book was still a nice, relaxing novel with spirited characters.	2000-11-14

I have only read one other book by Dean Koontz and let me tell you that it did not go well at all. The Bad Place. I could not believe I even forced myself to finish it. So, you can understand my hesitation when my friend was trying to convince me to read this one. And when I finally gave in, I was mesmerized!! I could not put this book down! It started so quickly and I was sitting alone in a dark house reading this book and I was actually kind of scared. I have never had a book really scare me and this one did it! It was intense and so smart. It is about a young woman and her fight against a dimented murderer as she strives to over come her horrifying past and the terrifying present. She fights for her own life and strives to save a young captive he has locked away. It is great to see how the victim and the crazed killer analyze each other psychologically, and read into each other's plans and thoughts. I highly recommend this book to anyone that is not not too frightened to have a little scare. It will take you on a journey in connection with this brave person and you will feel so connected with her, so truely scared for her. And yet, you are holding on just to see what the killer is going to do next.	2000-11-13

The main characters were wonderful and appealing, and the connection between them was great. I would have liked to have seen more of the individual women at Angel's Fall, or Sabrehawk's sidekick, Fletcher. They were somewhat forgotten as the story goes on. But for the most part, the book was well written and very enjoyable and heart warming. Through the challenges that Julie had to face, she strived to stay strong and pessimistic, even when the town tries to run her off. And as she fell in love with the strong Sabrehawk, she still strived to keep her independance. I recommend this book to anyone that likes adventurous romances with just a touch of mystery.	2000-11-06

I am very glad I did not. This is a chilling book about a generation of witches from around the 1600's to the present time. They all strive to be strong but they are pulled in many, many different directions. With them, you will share their pain, their struggles, their tears, their hostility, and that spirit that is always lurking in the back. It was deep and mesmerizing and even though Ms. Rice sometimes goes into detail about certainties in the book, she will throw something spooky or bone chilling at you that will drag you right back into the depth of the book again. I think this is the best witchcraft book I have ever read. The characters are rich and you feel hatred and sorrow and joy so much throughout it. You start to get attached to certain characters and then the plot will twist and you feel remorse for another and on and on this goes. And the characters have a tendency to stay with you, and you will all find your favorite. Though Petyr was not a witch, I believe he and Antha were my personal favorites. You will either hate them or love them, and each individual character is tantalizing in their own way, good or bad. It is a cycle and it is a beautifully written book that will suck you up and it will stay with you even after you have put the book down. I highly recommend  this book, especially to those that enjoy the chilling, creepy books and who have a big interest in the craft. I have the second part, Lasher, which I am just starting. I hope that it lives up to the expectations I have created after reading The Witching Hour.	2000-09-29

For one,  I absolutely love Anne Stuart, and for two, dark and sensual gothic  romances that are well-written are fabulous reads! I thought Anne Stuart's  &quot;Dark Journey&quot; was wonderful. It was dark and sinister and the  connection between Laura and Alex was just radiant. The plot was the best  part, really, and her writing and use of words was very, very good. Now I  thought Chelsea Quinn Yarbro's &quot;Catching Dreams&quot; was pretty good.  It was not as good as the other two stories, however, but it was good. The  beginning was captivating but as the story goes on, I think that maybe it  could have used a little more spunk. But for the most part, the story was  good and fun to read and the characters are rich and witty. &quot;Beyond  Twilight&quot; by Maggie Shayne I think was my favorite. That is very hard  for me to say because I have always been a HUGE Anne Stuart fan, but Ms.  Shayne's short story was fabulous. Cuyler's sense of humor was so much fun  as she strived to keep from seeing the dark side of things. My heart went  out to her so many times in this story. She and Ramsey (though he was sent  to destroy her) compliment each other so well with their personalities and  connection. I was sad when this story ended. I would have been so happy had  the story been a full novel. 5 Stars for &quot;Beyond Twilight.&quot;  All  in all, these three authors are very, very talented, and so very much fun.  They really add to the characters of their stories and makes it hard for a  reader not to love them. This book is HIGHLY recommended!	2000-09-06

It was a little slow here and there and somewhat dark and meloncholy. Just when you think things could not get  any worse for the two main characters, they do! A man struggles for  vengeance and for freedom while the woman strives to stay away from the  town that has condemned her a witch and tried to kill her, burning her  mother's dead body at the stake. It was heart wrenching and a little  stressful, but not your ordinary romantic book. For the most part, I  thought this was a good book about strength, courage and loyalties.	2000-08-23

It kept  me going through the whole story. You could completely feel the bond  between Simon and Alys and the way they connect, even when they are  fighting or refusing to touch each other. This was a wonderful fun romance,  out of the ordinary. And you will find fun in the other scenarios going on  around Alys and Simon, the people in the castle, her sister, thier  loyalties.

But as the book went on, I began to enjoy it more. It is about a  woman that had been hurt in the past and how she is trying to find herself,  find the happiness she has always wanted, and doing something that makes  her happy. The more I read, the &quot;closer&quot; I got to the characters  and the more enjoyable the story became. Although I admit the story line is  not something I usually go for, this book was very refreshing and relaxing.  I finished it while I was on vacation in the mountains, and it was the best  vacation book I think I have ever read. So, I recommend this book to anyone  ready for a good, relaxed story of an independant woman trying to grasp the  happiness she has seemed to miss out on all her life.	2000-08-23

I highly recommend it to anyone that has a close friend or a sister that you can't imagine losing. It is funny at parts, and sad at parts and so touching. The characters are so rich and  wonderful that they become a part of you. I was sad to see it end.	2000-07-11

It really gets to the heart of these people and it makes you feel as if you are right there going through it with the characters. It is the story of a love that was waisted because of  nonsense and misunderstandings. I highly recommend this to anyone that  wants to sit back, relax, and read a good, refreshing novel.	2000-07-11

There were times when I would actually laugh out loud and that is something I never do while I am reading. I highly recommend this great book to anyone that loves mystery  books with a dash of adventure!	2000-07-11
US	51139782	RQHV4KVL922AL	0451197224	396569937	The Heart of A Witch	Books	3	2	3	N	N	Good, but a bit slow	This was all in all, a pretty good book. It really gets into witchcraft  and shows it a gentler, friendlier side, but there were some very slow  points. And some irritating points as well. Shelley turned out to be a  dissappointment. She was so selfish and later turned out to be a weaker  character, and this whole being in love with your brother thing was out of  wack. I guess I am not disappointed in the book itself, but the characters  and some of thier lack of personality. I am glad I read the book, but I  recommend if anyone read it, they be prepared to spend  a lot of time doing  so.	2000-07-10

She writes so well about the struggle of a young woman, trying to be strong and maintain herself, and how she falls in love with  the wrong man. It is great, highly recommended!	2000-07-10

I really enjoyed reading this book, though it was not all happy and joyful through the whole thing. If anyone has ever fallen for a guy from the wrong side of the tracks, and had thier heart broken, this is the book for you.  It gets down deep into the heart of this particular woman, and you grow up  with her from a teeny bopper to a strong individual. I would recommend this  book to anyone. It has a lot of insight. It was a wonderful book and I  could not put it down.	2000-07-10
