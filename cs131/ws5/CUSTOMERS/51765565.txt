As a kid I really enjoyed the orginal foundation series. I then enjoyed several books that Asimov wrote on the same theme.  <br /> <br />As such I was quite keen to read this book.  <br /> <br />Unlike many such books written by writer on a fiction subject that someone else wrote, this writer obviously does know the early books by Asimov well. As such this book is what Asimov should have written to complete his series.  <br /> <br />I do confess that I would have prefered a shorter book as I thought it was too long. Also more details on psychohistory in the context of the foundation series maybe the writer could not do this as in later books in the series Asimov gave up on the idea being possible. Lastly I would have liked more on the game at the end.	2005-10-04

You may as well just look at the mathematical figures rather then read the words. <br /> <br />The other issue is the book was written not long after 911 and its long terms effects were over estimated by the writer.	2005-10-04

I would like to have seen more charts and table showing overall what was happening rather then stories about this fellow and this fellow and so on. These people tend to be the major decision makers so we don't get a feel of what over time the geologist or engineers are doing.  <br /> <br />Still the writer makes a very good study of oil and the industry. He shows its relationship to many political and social developments in the 1900s. I found the particularly the history of early oil industry quite fascinating.	2005-07-30

So it's very similar to a novel. Some of the facts are wrong as several reviewers have pointed out and some of the sources used e.g.  Victor Ostrovsky are very dubious indeed. <br /> <br />However it's the best study that I have seen on the actual bombing.

Amazingly for such a major series of battles, their has been very little written about Hitler's Western Wall.  <br /> <br />The writer of this book has tried to seal this gap. Unfortunately it does need better. The writer has a habit of writing sweeping statements eg if the allies had not broken the wall, Nazi Germany would have survived. I doubt it, all that would have happened assuming the Allies were held is that the Soviets would have grabbed more of Germany in the East and the Allied advance up in Italy would have been more important too. <br /> <br />Still however it is a well written book. It certainly not boring.  I suspect that the writer does know a lot about his subject and the military. Reads like an adventure story. Full of interesting facts. Well worth a read.	2005-04-13

Be warned it is more a study of Hitler as a political-military leader then a military commander as such. As such much of the book discusses Hitler before the war. <br /> <br />Several conclusions of the writer, I find doubtful eg that if the British had been driven out of Gibraltar, the Royal navy would have to pull out of the Mediterranean and that Yugoslavia and Greece delayed his attack on Russia. <br /> <br />Overall the writer trying to build up Hitler as much more then an *nothing* of a general underestimates him. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Hitler was always aware that if the war continued for any long period, he would lose. He said a few times that if the war continues for a long time, he would lose. Hitler also felt sick and that he would die soon. If he did die and the mission would be lost. As such he was always in a rush. <br /> <br />I think the writer underestimates Hitler as a military commander. It is true that Hitler was a *trick* general whose method conformed to a single pattern of identifying a weak point and then unleash the greatest force possible at it. Hitler had no choice. He had to move quickly. It all tended to work as long as his enemies really did not want to fight him and/or his enemies were much weaker then him. <br /> <br />It tended to fail as time went on and his enemies raised better armies, led by generals as good as his equipped with equipment  better then his. Yet Hitler was able as very few war leaders were to keep his country going in war when all was lost.	2005-02-28

However the facts remain that a civil war existed in Afghanistan which the Taliban's together with al-Qaida were definitely winning. A few US and other Western forces together with the Western Air forces changed the result of the conflict in a very short time. So to me the book has a strong ring of truth in it. <br /> <br />You are not going to get for awhile a definite history (if such a thing exists) for quite awhile. This takes time and in the absence of anything better I suggest that this book will have to do.  <br /> <br />I can assure you that it is a very exciting read. Read like a novel which I found it hard to put down.	2005-01-26

However I tends to agree with most of the reviewers here that many of the facts he presents are a bit dubious and that many of the arguments are weak too.     Sometimes his arguments are silly too. For example when discussing Dr Tipler, suddenly he goes on at length that as Dr Tipler is a first born so his thoughts are tainted.    Often when one debates with people for a long time you tend to fall into a trap of trying to score points, keep on going on with points that are dubious but you got away with, bypassing your opponents good points rather then considering the facts on their merit. This what I suspect has happened with the author.	2005-01-02

If not for the airlift, Israel would not have perished. Both the Egyptains and Syrians were held before it started. If they had not stopped them  then Israel would have had to turn to a nuclear defence.  <br /> <br />What it did do was allow Israel to inflict a major defeat on the Arab armies!	2004-09-19

If the movie follows the book too closely then what is the point of both reading the book and seeing the movie. This book however is quite different to the film. They compiment each other nicely.  <br />It was fasinating to read of the problem encounted by the Russians in trying to match the US navy particularly once they went to nuclear power. Once they did so the dangers both to themselves and the enviroment went up dramatically.<br />What I did notice while reading the book is that you get a feel of how much there is to get it right on a submarine. It certainly was a tribute to the Western navy designers that most of these problems did not occur like these in their ships.<BR> <BR>I was also very impressed with the bravery and skill of the soviet sailors and commanders that went out in ships that were sub standard and how well under pressure they did behave.	2004-03-31

I doubt for example that the start of the US war with Japan had much to do with Soviet spies.<br />However overall the book makes a very good case that the Venona conclusively proved the guilt of such traitors like Alger Hiss and Julius and Ethel Rosenberg. Also that several others such as I.F. Stone was a paid Communist spy.<br />However I do not think the book shows conclusive evidence that Robert Oppenheimer was a spy. Although it certain does present a good case that he might have been.<br />If you are interested in Soviet spying in the US this book is probably as good as you can get.	2004-01-10

As long as the V1s and V2s flew the German people could think that they were striking back. <br />This theory may explain other conflicts like Saddam in Iraq and his scud attacks.	2003-12-28

It is a well researched book. I found the similarities between Britain in the 1920s and 1930s and the United States today an interesting idea. The central thesis is that both these powers had too small a military for its needs and that this is the cause of many of its problems in national policy. The writers then take us on a journey of both countries policies and point out where they feel this is shown out.<br />Although I do agree that both had large commitments and that their military although big by world standards was too small for their needs.  I cannot agree in almost all of the examples quoted where a stronger force would have changed much. As the writers point out the British forces were stronger enough to handle the Turks in 1920 if they really wanted too. The results of this conflict from the British point of view were quite satisfactory. A pro Western and neutral Turkey controlling this important region developed out of this conflict. A larger Greece would still have fallen under Nazi control and by controlling more of the region would have been worse for the Allies then what did happen. I would agree that this conflict certainly was a lot bloodier particularly to Greeks. then it should have been. Later on with other crisis's such as the Corfu,  monitoring Versailles, Ethiopia, the Rhineland and Munich in all these occasions the British suffered from lack of will not lack of military force. If the will had been their, then the military was strong enough.<br />These arguments would also be true of many of the examples quoted of the US too for example in 1990s both in Yugoslavia and Iraq. <br />A stronger military at best could be said to give more confidence to the decision makers.<br />The real lesson in the book is that victorious powers often after the war must have the willingness to enforce the peace they fought for. Overall it is certainly a worth while read.	2003-12-21

I think this book gets very close to racism of the worst type. Certainly Jews and their religion are painted in a very bad light.     The  captain  certainly seemed to have had a pretty interesting life in the region as he goes from one sight seeing trip to another. Little is said of his working actual tasks.    Comments are frequently quoted with no factual evidence to back them up for example Jews were driven out of Egypt because of the actions of the Zionist. If so, why were Greeks also driven out at the same time!     Zionist are described as bad people, Arabs generally as okay (obviously our commander missed the fun earlier when the Arabs were the main terrorist in the region) and the British were knowing, stupid and caring.      When the British hang a man for resisting, that is okay when someone else hangs a British soldier, in retaliation, that is terrible and a crime. The truth is that all sides killed people.     The reality is that the British in the period discussed by this captain were long past their use by date. The empire was almost over. They were trying to keep the empire alive in an area populated by people that did not want them. Instead of just saying, we fought for the empire, we get these rather silly arguments that the British were right as the UN solution was wrong because it was undemocratic. If so, what were the British there at all because the local did not vote them in? If Britain was so concerned about democracy why not do something about it long before they left!     At the end, he shows how important it was for the average British soldier to walked out of a mess with no regrets except that there reputation should not be damaged.	2003-12-01

A neutral Italy was maybe possible. The writer certainly shows that British politician Eden made many mistakes in dealing with Italy in this period. <br />However I would like to have read more on why Mussolini did several actions in particular why he did declare war on the US. What was he thinking when he did it? The writer just leaves us with the words that he went mad. Also how did he feel as time went on and Italian troops were dieing in what became more and more Hitler's war? How did he feel as an Italian? Did he feel any responsibility for their deaths?<BR>Maybe the writer could continue the work?<br />Overall I found it to being a very good and readable book.	2003-11-09

As such we are given very little about the conflicts and doubts that must have gone though their minds at this time when it looked like Hitler had won.<br />Two great leaders Churchill and Menzies in the British conflict appear to have come into conflict over the conduct of the war. To Churchill, WW2 became a crusade that he was willing to give all, in an attempt to defeat Hitler. To Menzies the British empire was both incompetently being led by Churchill which as the book shows is probably correct in the gross failure of the British handling of the war in Greece and getting involved in a conflict that it could not win. He felt that the British Commonwealth should make terms with Hitler.<br />In an attempt to replace Churchill, Menzies lost his position as prime minister of Australia.<br />Mixed in with their respective egos and ambitions it makes fascinating reading.	2003-08-07

WHERE IS EVERYBODY?: Fifty Solutions to the Fermi Paradox and the Problem of Extraterrestrial Life	Books	5	12	21	N	N	Its very good	Almost all books on SETI or ETC (as this writer calls them) just brush aside this problem. This ruins as far as I am concerned almost all of them. So this book is refreshing. <br />The writer starts off with a brief discussion on the Fermi paradox and states quite correctly that it is one of the greatest paradoxes of science today. I agree with him that its answer will be of major significance to us all. <br />He then goes though 50 solutions to the problem that have been suggested. He firstly provides a brief discussion on each point and his comments which you can agree or disagree with. I think that he is fair in his comments until he came to 45 to 49. His comment here, I think need a lot more work.<br />Some such as solution (11) where he discusses that SETI may not want to colonise worlds after making at best a few colonies, I found weak. If only as I would expect that these colony worlds to be more in favour of continuing expanding even more so then the homeworld. One would expect that colony will produce colony.<br />Solution (26) that the SETI after hitting a certain level of technology goes elsewhere eg different universes seemed very similar to solution (13) that they go to place we are not looking for. Maybe it should have been a (13b) rather then its own solution.<br />Solution (34) that the conditions were not suitable for life till very recently is one that I wondered why he did not develop further as it seems to me to be one of the most promising solutions. The conditions that allow a SETI to form is relatively recent in the universe. Although it cannot fully answer the Fermi paradox, as the writer states it, it may be able to answer some of it. Most of the galaxies and stars cannot have a SETI as they are too young. I don't know why he did not use this part in his grand solution (50).<br />His comment to solutions (45) to (49), I think need more work as several others have stated here.  <br />His solution at the end (50) is not new and also contains amathematical error in step 5 half a million  x (1 -20%) = 400,000 not 100,000 as he states. <br />Another solution that the author might want to consider might be solution (51) that the ocean covers on earth 3/4 of the globe. This almost all. What if almost all the world was covered in water say 98%, could such a water world create a SETI? I doubt it. <br />Be warned that he supports the position that we are alone and offers quite good reasoning for his position. Its a position I agree with. But at the very least by reading this book you will get the best discussion that I have seen on the Fermi paradox. I liked it so much that after read the book and went out to buy another copy for a friend for his birthday as I wanted to keep this book for reference.	2003-04-26
US	51765565	R271JKKKXIVXI2	0156010801	357381714	Probability 1	Books	1	3	5	N	N	Its very ordinary	One of the major problems in any study of SETI is the Fermi paradox. If they are SETI why do we not know about them.<br />To the credit of this book he does make an attempt to deal with the problem and not like so many other writers try to brush off the problem. His solution is that we are among the most advanced civilisations. At present this is the best response that I have heard to this question. The other is that more advanced civilizations go somewhere else - where is the question.<br />Unfortunately his arguments do not appear to be very convincing an example would he puts the question that a pre-Columbian Indian sage would reason that life existed on Earth only in the Americas because if there were other continents other then America - life would have developed intelligence, and one of these civilizations would have built large canoes and come here. <br />My answer back is that he would not pose this question as not  pre-Columbian knew of America as a continent. All they knew was their local area. Around which they would have known were inhabited by unknown tribes. If one assumes that this sage knew all that the US Indians knew, then he would have known that tribes in Alaska had contact with another continent.<br />Also that the relationship <BR>life-&gt; intelligence -&gt; civilization -&gt; SETI <BR>has hardly been proven.<br />His final arguements is a rather simple probablity theory that in mathematical terms states if the odds for life is very small on a planets. If you have countless planets, then life must exist on some of them. A point that tells us nothing new.<br />The best books on this subject, I suggest is <BR>Barrow and Tipler - The Anthropic Cosmological principle<BR>Frank White - The SETI factor	2003-03-29

US	51765565	R12OZTG8TL5SC9	0393020444	932833170	The Holocaust on Trial	Books	2	13	26	N	N	This trial deserves better .	To start off as a real keen reader of WW2 I have read several of David Irving books on Nazi Germany. Some are very good like HITLER'S WAR and some are fair. Despite what you read in this book they are not brilliantly accurate even in a narrow military point of view. For example the treatment of the German army at Stalingrad is almost a complete cover up for Hitler.Those like John Keegan that say that they are good military histories probably don't care enough to go though them as Guttenplan makes clear in his book. What David Irving books are good is they show us what Hitler might have thought at the time. They have been called a study that Hitler might have written of himself in the war. <br />However this is not the issue of this case. What got David Irving into trouble is Holocaust revisionism? And in particular here his attempts to use the British legal system to provide money and get legal system with the respect that comes with it to justify his writings. In this book you will find a good coverage of the trial day by day as most of the reviewers have pointed out. As such I will not add to these points already mentioned. <br />And the main problem that I found with the book is that the writer tries to put his attitude about Jews and what is his own preduce and half truths into the case. So the reader is subjected to a rather weird idea! That the memory of the holocaust is used by Jews for political purposes mainly to prop up Israel. That somehow it was only after 1967 in the US that Jews cared about it as such. <br />Let me tell Guttenplan something that in my parents house, my grandfather lived and in a little room he filled up the walls with pictures of his dead brothers, father, cousins, mother and many school mates and friends all gone. After the war he went back to his town and collected all the pictures. The only thing left of this community is my grandfathers pictures. When I was a little boy I used to hear from him about the war. I knew about the Nazi,the labor camps and the death camps before I knew about politics.<br />Guttenplan however attacks several works with a vehemence such as Hitler's Willing Executioner by Daniel Gold. I would say that if ever a book was ruined by overstating a case it would be that one but it is certainly a first class book and his arguments overall are probably correct. Another book From Time Immemorial : The Origins of the Arab-Jewish Conflict over Palestine by Joan Peters which the writer devotes a large footnote in the book not where most of the footnotes are at the end to discuss Norman Finkelstein who is not a respected scholar and considered to being basically a crackpot arguments about it. Certainly Joan Peters arguments are now almost accepted by all. One suspects that Guttenplan reason in rejecting these books has less to do with logic then with his politics.<br />Which would explain his rather weird attitudes that he tries to wrap around this case.	2002-08-06

It is the best book on this war that I have read and I have read a quite a few. <br />Its the first one that puts a more balanced view on the war. Essentially the Finns held for three months held their lines some like the Mannerheim that were a much better line of fortifications then many others suggest and some that were little more then a line on the map until they were defeated by a combination of Russian overwhelming numbers, equipment and better generalship.<br />The other issue is the writer does explain that the Finns could have avoided joining with Hitler in WW2! This episode is a major black mark on what is after all a glorious effort by free people to remain free who of all the countries in Eastern Europe was the only one to preserve democracy in the face of Hitler and Stalin.<br />As such certain issues like could the war be prevented by the Finns are left partly in the air. The writer does suggest that they might have. I would say that since the Finns ended out giving up a great deal of land early in the war as they could not defend it anyway, one could suggest that Finland might have been able at little risk to negotiate with Stalin and offer more in an attempt to stop the war at little risk. <br />Which brings up my major problem with the book. Its almost all purely from the Finnish side. Almost nothing is given from the Soviet side. <br />Its a good book on this war but I hope someone writes an updated one with more details on the Russian side.	2002-06-30

The book itself is an interesting study of the effects of engineering on society. I found the chapters to being very interesting and enjoyed them very much.<br />However the book is let down as it lacks a higher standard of accuracy that one would need in a public talk on the radio. For example he talks about the Saqqara Bird and states that it shows evidence of an ancient Egyptian airplane. This is quite disputed as tests have shown that if it were a glider, it would be badly balanced, have some traces of a tail and require more spiral stability. Most people suggest that it was probably a child's toy or a weather vane. I found this out by doing a quick search on the net just now. The writer should have done this himself.<BR> <BR>Also writer seems to be quite prejudice to the military, he makes some sweeping statement that war speeds up invention and states that there is not a shred of supporting evidence for this. He then tries to show it by talking about air flight speed. He then shows a graph that the rate speeds have gone up regardless of the political changes. Yet even he does state that some of these speeds were by the military. I would say that his statements show that there is some supporting evidence. He also states that any other technology would do as well. Okay what about submarines, radar and the atomic bomb. All these were developed for the military. Not to mention inventions that have only military value like artillery.	2002-06-23

Karen Armstrong has shows that Islamic, Jewish and Christian fundamentalism has much in common in history. She feels that they are modern ideologies that have developed in response to the secular modern society by believers. <br />What I think she has done is studied Christian fundamentalism and attempted to show that Jewish and Islam are the similar.<BR>Christian fundamentalist certainly did derive as a response to a secular world. <br />But this is less true of Muslim fundamentalist. The major Moslem fundamentalist would be the Wahhabi religious movement, a movement that she does not even mention! It certainly did not start in response to a secular society but in an Arabia under the Turks. What gave it power is that it was adopted by a family that eventually controlled Saudi Arabia! It then became a state religion. Most people were forced into it.<br />And it would be even less true of the Jews. Jewish fundamentalist started, she claims in Eastern Europe about 200 years ago. Even if we accept this to being true then it was certainly not a secular society. The area was ruled by deeply religious people hostile to them but certainly not secular. Neither was the Jewish culture of the time secular. Yet the slight changes, she quotes hardly seem to justify the argument that it is a new force. <br />She further argues that many fundamentalist misinterpreted their religion, by using it to justify murder which she states is a total distortion of religion. This is just wishful thinking.	2002-02-21

I am not sure why various fields were selected but overall they give a good range of concepts - weather, biology, stock market, outbreak of war and mathematics. <br />The writer then at the end of the discussion gives his own grading for how well we can predict an event and how well we can explain it. These figures are purely subjective and I often disagreed with them.<br />There are often two problems in trying to predict something using science. The first is how good is your scientific knowledge of something occurs. The second is how good is your data. For example imagine a rocket being feed wrong data. Although our knowledge of mechanics is excellent, it will probably crash.<br />Three of them are actually fields that I have spent a considerable period of time and study on and can comment on them in detail. <br />The weather I found very interesting. It is a case where we have very good data and our theories look good. The major problem seems to be our ability to process the data. <BR> <BR>He then goes into predicting climate. Here we have good data but lousy theories. We really know very little about this field. <br />Stock market - I found his study starting to being very good on the theoretical points of the merits of different theories. Unfortunately just as he started to get interesting he stopped. Possibly as his study is to short or he lacks the experience in this field. <br />Here again we have a field where we have good data but lousy theories.<br />However many studies of various theories of the market are examined. Some that the writer states show that the market is not perfect. But he seems a bit dubious about this at times. Quite rightly I feel. For example he shows over time that smaller companies are more profitable. This maybe due to because they are riskier they are undervalued by the market. This argument istrue of even large companies with low P/E that the writer misses altogether. There is often a very good reason why the market gives them a low P/E.  But the logical point now is that if this is so what does it say about the market. If the market is overcompensating for risk then it cannot be perfect. <br />The other main problem that in my experience from many years in the stock market there are three main variables on a share one how well the company does, how well the market does and how well the shareholder does out of it. They can and often are very different. <br />If the market is near perfect as some theories suggest because the public know enough of the facts. As people do not know or use the information equally well some people must be using the information better then others. Some are showing over the years repeatedly better performance then the average. Buffet is a huge one and I am a tiny one. Now why? This is not explained. Buffet does not buy heaps of shares but a few selected ones. <br />The next discussion was on trying to predict war. This is even harder to predict.  Here we have little data. For example how much knowledge did the US have on the North Vietnamese government thinking processes at the start of the Vietnam war or how much did the Egyptians of the Israeli government in 1967? <br />Here the writer claims that after the event our theories can offer scientifically defensible schemes for explaining how any given war came about. This is nonsense.  Historians are still debating the causes of just about every war I know of! Often there reasoning seems like rationalisations for what happened.<br />He does go though a few theories that just shows that we really know almost nothing about predicting war. Almost all historians would probably admit that even knowing what they know now, very few war could have predicted say a month before it happened. One historian I read stated that Germany attack on Russia was remarkable as it's about the only warthat you could predict. Interesting though I would argue that Stalin did not.<BR> <BR>Above all he claims to make war you need cash. This is true but it predicts little as in today's world a country can often by a third party be given the cash. <br />This is the same problem with the master variables discussed - population, technology and resources. Where he states that you need technology to make war. This maybe true but predicts nothing, as a country may be able to get it without having it. For example Egypt under Nasser had the population. Russia supplied the technology and never got paid as Egypt had little resources.<br />The last section is about mathematics and I am a bit confused as to why he put it in. There he goes though Godel's principal. I found this whole section a rather confused mess. Mathematics is more a study of human thought then science as such. <BR>Perhaps the writer was trying to say that we could never really be sure of anything even an idealised system.<br />He then gives it a B for predictability that is quite arbitrary. <br />Overall I found the book interesting as one-person attitude to this concept of looking at certainty.	2001-11-17

However I found the book quite boring to read. Trying to make it clear, to the general reader he ended out boring, someone who knows a little more. <br />I found the book being quite bad. The fundamental problem in this subject is the Femni paradox. If they are so many out there, then at least one would be a space faring. If so then estimates vary as to how quickly they could colonise the galaxy. A conservative figure would be between 10 to 300 million years. This period in galaxy history is nothing. If so, we should not have to look at all. Evidence of there existence would be everywhere. The writer very briefly talks about this, then goes off into a tangent and leaves it. Either he has never read any book that discusses this (eg Frank Tipler) or ignores them. In either case its an issue.<br />Some of his history as well is a bit dubious like his argument about the Ming dynasty navy stopping of exploration. This he claims left their place to be filled by Europeans. The Ming's unlike the Europeans were not traders. There is no evidence to suggest that they would become traders. Their exploration ships showed that China had no enemies in the South. The only result would be, that they would have to spend large sums of money. Those resources were needed, as the Ming bureaucrats stated, where they faced a real threat in the North.  This history would prove them correct.  And history suggests that the real lesson is that if research is not profitable (in an economic sense) then goverments can and will pull the plug.<br />The writer goes on and on making some quite fantastic claims that make life far more possible, then it obviously is in reality. Most evidence now seems to suggest that life is very rare. For example recent evidence suggests that water is less important to Mars history then he suggests. <br />Although I approve of more research for space, this writer often seems to be more on the political rather then scientific.	2001-08-13

The arguments for these missions that despite the large political cost that eventually occurred (as the result of Gary Powers capture showed) were worth paying.<br />You can feel what the pilots on the missions felt though their stories on the missions that they flew.

It explores how they got their intelligence and what they did with the knowledge that they gained from it. Despite their friendship the used it to advance the agenda of what they wanted for their own countries. At times their intelligence departments actually came into conflict as they both had different hopes and ambitions.  As the war progressed these difference became more important.<br />I found the book very easy to read. Full of information that although I am a WW2 fanatic I have never seen before.

Most of what we know of these people is what the Romans wrote about them. Which is not much! This is a problem as its very hard to write a study from Roamn literature about Roman and the Barbarians because there is so little written about it.<br />The book as a whole is certainly a good read.

It was really  interesting and I hope the writer writes some more about Ovid life there in a future book.<br />However unfortunately after reading this book I did not feel that I had learnt much about these barbarian tribes. A little about what Romans thought about these people. Overall I have not found anything new that has not been presented before in other books.<br />The writer also subscribes to a popular view that I don't, that the Roman never fell but evolved into medieval society.	2001-05-27

I also am quite a critic. When most people give a WW2 book 5 stars I give 4 or sometimes less. But this book is excellent and definitely deserves 5 five stars. <br />One of the main problems with history books of this period is that there is so much written its hard to read something new. This book does. It throws light on a little known subject the air war on the Eastern Front. Although I have read much on this front, I never realised how important the Russian airforce was.<br />It has great photographs. I like how they are spread out though the book allowing a user to see the photographs while reading the book. Using them to jump back and forwards across the lines and displaying brilliant biograph of pilots on both sides we can appreciate what they are going though.<br />Much of the critics of this book I have read it is not correct. The writer are certainly not saying that the Russian airforce was as good as the Germans man for man.  They blame that largely and quite correctly on Stalin. Its interesting that the German aces are clearly displayed with there 200 + kills whereas the Russian aces have 13 +. What they are saying is that it was very important in the war.  <br />The main mission of the Russian air force in this period was to stop the German armies advance and I would have liked is more study on the effect on the German army. Not that this is not covered I just would have preferred more. <br />I would also have preferred more technical information on the planes and in particular in production. <br />Another point mentioned that I will dispute was the bombing of city of Kosice. Its still disputed today, who did this particular bombing. The writer claim it was the Germans but offer no proof. Its still one of the mysteries of the war. I find it strange that no-one has come forward after the war to claim credit for this operation.<br />Much of the discussion on the Soviet bombing on Berlin wasvery interesting. As was the fanaticism of the Russian pilots. I don't know any other airforce that used ramming as standard tactics. <br />I am looking forward to the next volumes.	2001-05-13

So someone like myself who knows little about US and North Korea relations got little from this book. <br />Disappointingly it does not include that much about how other goverments (in particular South Korea) reacted and played in these talks. <br />However if you want to know about how the North Korean goverment have behaved with the US this is a very good book. I was stunned to read the sort of documents the US has had to sign in dealing with the North Koreans. <br />It shows the limitation that the US faces even in a region that it is the major power.	2001-03-11

No having read the other books often I am left unsure of what facts he is basing his arguments on. It appears to me that I have come into his argument halfway so I do not really know what he is talking about. <br />This does not really matter  as its is a fine collection of histories of mass murders committed in this century by various governments. With some excellent tables and graphs. All clearly explained. <br />I found some of the arguments a bit strained like it is mass murder to drop bomb on enemy cities in wartime. I don't think so but the writer is willing to make such a case which I disagree with. However going over his tables there is little I could argue with. <br />I was surprised how many mass murders had occurred this century. Stunned by also the vagueness of the numbers involved for example how many did the communist kill in Russia answer no less then 28 million and no more then 127 million. His guess 62 million. <br />Even the Nazi the most studied one in history where many of the people involved have been extensively studied and interviewed. With much documentation available the best guess is between 15 to 31.6 million. His guess 20.9 million. This one I spent a lot of time over as I am quite well read on the holocaust and it seemed to me his figures were on the low side. <br />The same I though with his later study of Vietnam. The figure just seem to low. <br />But apparently it goes on with all the other mass murders - apparently no one really knows just how many. <br />I have never seen a better list and I recommend it for anyone interested me modern history.	2001-03-08

So  I have read the story of David many times.  This book takes it from an different angle.  What really was the historical David we will never  know!  What we have is the greatest piece of writings in the world but when, where and who wrote them we are not sure.  In the bible its very hard to determine where fiction and history merge. <br />The story of David in this book is in a sense quite negative in that David is portrayed as a power hungry person. However to me it made him more real. I certainly have not my sense of grandeur in David. Some of his explanations somehow appear to be pretty weak. But he does present his evidence but that is not the writers fault as much as the lack of historical information. <br />He does leave us with a bad taste to the writer of the bible who he states &quot;is trying to promote or excuse David&quot;. This may be true because we really do not know very much about who the writers were or there motives. <br />It well written and I would recommend this book to you.	2001-01-23

What they wanted to learn? Or even how they operated. Just a few scattered stories. <br />Of course Markus Wolf never did anything really bad either. Now the cold war is over he was even a secret democratic. Just with a different twist. He seems very hurt that the people who is served for so many years the Russian deserted him. The Germans tried him for his crimes. He has even discovered that having a father that was Jewish, means that there is one people that cannot reject him the Jews. Which we hear a lot about. Yet he probably hurt these people in his life too. <br />Some how I doubt very much that he did not know what was happening. That he never engaged in anything really bad.	2001-01-20

Books	4	17	20	N	N	Very good	The point is made which I agree with is that the responsibility for the murders should be with the murders. <br />I found it this the best and quite a readable account of this issue. Its a series of articles which allow the reader to reach a conclusion.  It discusses the US and  Britain. It makes it quite clear Stalin did not care and did nothing. <br />There are basically two issue involved. <br />The first is could it be done. After reading the discussion in the book but its left to you the reader to decide. I think it could have been. There seems to be no reason, why not? The technical, military and intelligence problems seem quite solvable. <br />The second is if it could have been done, could it have made any difference.  This question is more difficult to answer. If the operation had been done its quite possible that the people would have been killed by other methods eg forced marches or bullets. However this was harder and slower then the gas chambers. It goes on to discuss an air raid on Hungary scared the government there into stopping the transportation of Jews. This was purely an  accidental effect of timing. The air raid occurred just when the transportation of Jews started. The Hungarian government  thought it was because of the transportation and stopped them. It then discusses the effect of this air raid. Leaving the reader with the impression that maybe political action may have helped to stop some of these murders. <br />The question that I would like to ask the writers &quot;Is if they had been Americans or English being sent to those gas chambers - would they have been bombed?&quot;.  I think they would have.	2001-01-14

US	51765565	R3TFQ8TQVYGI23	0671760823	40825669	Hitler and His Secret Partners	Books	2	13	19	N	N	Very disappointing	I very much enjoyed James Pool earlier book about who financed Hitler. This book I enjoyed far less. It exaggerates the economic forces driving Hitler and the power of the business people in Germany.<br />It has selective quotes from Speer. For example Speer makes it quite clear in his book that Hitler never was as dependent on these financiers as Pool states. When he asked Hitler to make a statement to support them in the long term, Hitler refused.<br />Many fact Pool states I doubt. Such as that Hitler needed to attack Russia for financial reasons. That Dr Todt was murdered by Goring (I would like to see more evidence for this).<br />Some I just think are ridiculous such as the Allied could have dropped paratroop near the dead camps, given the Jew's weapons  and so freed thousands of Jew's.  Then he goes to state that such an attack would have created serious military problems for Germany. Untrained men, without leadership  and starving with a few hand guns would have I am sure made a heroic resistance but I doubt little military problems to the German military. <br />Furthermore his so called &quot;new&quot; evidence that he presents about the drugs that Hitler was taking affecting Hitler's physical and mental state is hardly new. <br />Overall I think he exaggerates the business world hold on Hitler. I agree many business people took advantage of the war but they certainly  did not control Hitler and were hardly his partners.	2000-11-06

I have problems with partners, employees who could easily get better paying jobs and clients. As such I tend to read these sort of  books to get ideas. <br />Many of the laws I think are invalid eg use absence  to increase respect and honor. If you go absence often you become  irrelevant. If your a cad in the end, as these authors ask you to be then  you will be found out. <br />In any case the book is divide into 48 chapters.  Each starts with one of their rules. Then the rest of the chapter discusses  it. It has nice stories, sayings and supposely historical accounts to  support these laws. <br />However these historical accounts are often wrong.  For example the Persian empire did not start to unravel with Cyrus defeat.  After his death it actually grew and got more powerful. The nationalist in  China did not wear themselves down in a war with Japan during world war 2  but made an unofficial cease fire with them. <br />Somehow while reading this  book, I got the feeling that these people who wrote it have never  experienced what its like to play the power game. What I think they have  done is mix Sun-tzu and Machiavelli books. This accounts for why their  examples are so old. But not as good or useful as either of these books  because they do not have the practical experience that these people had. As  a little player in this field, I can see that this is not something you can  learn from books without practical experience.	2000-08-01

I have read many books from this writer and up to now have always though him very good. But this book is just a confused mess of what he thinks is not right. The writer is trying to say that capitalism as practiced in the  1950's and 60's is good but now days its gone to far. An example of his  logic is that American court system as practiced now is good? How good it  is with these fictitious made up cases with ridiculous high pay outs.<br />I  just cannot accept his arguments. I have worked in a large organization as  a storeman and now after many years I have become a programmer. I certainly  do not see this as step backwards. I much rather prefer working a computer,  then lugging refrigerators and stoves up and down elevators. Having to load  up trucks and unloading trucks. Even forget the money their is no way I  would want to go back to such a life. <br />I do agree with him that a  hospital primary purpose is to treat the sick not to make money but what  does the ownership have to do with it? Just because a government runs the  hospital does not make it a temple of medicine. An accountant who worked in  the auditors department told me how people would just take holidays for  many weeks without telling anyone and their co-workers would cover up for  them so they would not lose their holiday pay.  Money would just  disappeared, no one knew where it was. Every Friday afternoon the guys  would leave for a big booze up. Medical equipment was being purchased for  fantastic sums. Its proving to being much better to get a private company  to run the hospital.<br />Their is an old saying that you can never go back. I  am an Australian. Australia in the 50's and 60's was slowly falling behind  the world. We were supporting large inefficient industries with our mineral  and agricultural products. Over the years world prices on primary industry  have fallen. How would the writer expect old style Australia to survive in  today world? Maybe like New Zealand were they used to joke &quot;that the  last one leaving New Zealand should turn off the lights&quot;. Our  countries opened up our economies because at the end their was no choice.   We did not want to be a banana republics but modern progressive countries.	2000-07-25

It goes over Israel building of the bomb from the mid 50 to the 70's purely from a political level. <br />The big problem is that the book goes off topic.  To make the  bomb Israel needed France. Their is very little in the book dealing with  Israel and France regarding the bomb. Why did France help Israel we do not  know? What promises were made? How much did it costs? <br />Yet he goes on and  on about Israel and USA. With stuff that are of minor importance as far as  the bomb was concerned. As such their are large sections of the book you  can just skip. <br />I also found it fustrationg that their was little about  the actual technical or construction  problems they would have faced in  making the bomb. The book sort of glosses over this. We do not know how  much it costs, only a lot. How many people were involved. Was it  technically a hard job? Was it scientifically hard? And so on.	2000-07-16

Rather then attempt to estimate what the future  would bring what he suggested was that you make four futures. The first was  a better then expected , the second was what was expected (the standard  world), the third was worse then expected and the four was wipe out -  disaster. It took all of few minutes for him to explain it to me. I feel  that I learnt as much in that few minutes as I did reading this book about  making scenarios.     I have not learnt how to make scenario's any better  then the oil executive explained it since reading this book. The main  problem is that once you create these worlds (or scenarios) what do you do  with them. There are so many different variables and somehow you never seem  to predict the ones that happen. So whats the point make it simple and put  in as few changes as possible.     Also my experience is that decision  makers do not want to know, you need 5 to 9 trucks. They want to know how  many trucks do we need.      The book just goes on and on about the authors  life. I know he worked here and there but I am not really interested.    Update: Since I wrote this many years ago, I have since reread the book and I think one idea in the book is very good. Pick two major items that you think will affect your subject say A and B. Then say each of these major items is better or worse so you have now four scenarios (A+, B+) (A-, B+) (A+, B-) (A-, B-). Now work with those. It is a good idea that I have tried and works well.	2000-07-10

As a computer programmer with a love of political science, I wrote awhile ago a very similar computer program, that Lars describes in this book. While reading this book, I got no idea just how big or complex his was but  mine was done over a few days when I was too sick to come to work and  wanted to do something. Yet it seems to being far more sophisticated then  this one. For example it had sea and mountains, its military conflicts were  treated better and not all regions were equal in resources but normally  distributed.  I do not quote it as a brilliant peace of work on the  contrary quite ordinary. Somehow I get the feeling that it was better then  the computer model quoted here.  What the reader would really love is a  chance to get your hands on this program and play with it. Why it was not  supplied on a disk or a web address given I am not sure but it should have  been? <br />I left with the feeling after reading it that I have learnt little  on the subject. Maybe use it as a brief introduction Many of the charts are  not well explained. <br />The biggest problem I think in this subject is not  so much how empires start but why they fall? Why do empires that seems to  be so efficient, and strong, collapse. His tended to collapse due to  military over reach. Yet their are many other reasons for empires collapse.   <br />Interestingly my model gave quite different results then this one. Mine  tended to collapse due to the core (or center) becoming too expensive.  Growing citizenship in the empire means that the center cannot treat the  provinces like cash cows and bully them anymore.  The empire becomes rigid  both in economy and structure and cannot change in changing circumstances.  Surrounding it are nations that have copied from the empire technology and  system. Military spending goes up as the relative economy to the barbarians  goes down. Wars being defensive are not profitable. In time the provinces  often decide they do not need this expensive and interferring core, they  are not prepared to fight for it in strange places and want to separate.  This is particularly true of the richer ones and the poor ones get dumped  as the core cannot afford them any more.	2000-07-09

If Israel cannot be blamed then he will try US and England. The writer claims it a serious history book written in  together with three history professors. Yet as a sample of how the writer  argues. It almost caused me to choked when he claims that Israel support of  the US in Korea caused the Prague show trials. In this notes he goes  further and claims the doctors plot in Russia in 1953. Someone forgotten  about the trials earlier such as in Bulgaria and there was the Rajik  Trial before Prague.     The reality is that a Palestinian state could have  been established anytime before 1949. This is what the UN and the English  were begging them  to accept. Afterwards the Arabs who controlled the Gaza  strip and the West bank could have established a Palestinian state. After  1967 Israel offered to give it back for peace. Basically that is what they  have been doing since. In exchange for peace with Egypt they gave back the  Sinai. The Palestinian have got the Gaza and will get most of the West Bank  except probably some warning sites.	2000-06-11

The victims are discussed, not very much  the ones who succeeded. <br />An issue not discussed but interesting, if you  take the examples the writer quotes. Was the intelligence officers in the  victims case  overall correct? Maybe because it was so silly they did not  believe that their enemy would do it. Of the nine example only two won  their wars at the end, the others lost. For example Hitler should never  have attacked Russia while at war with England. Hitler himself had written  about the stupidity of going to war on two fronts. It may have been the  decision that costs him the war. Similarly it not very clever for the  Japanese to attack Pearl Harbor. What ever short term advantage she gained  from this was more then paid for in gaining the hatred of the USA. How  could the Germans really be blamed for not expecting something as stupid as  Dieppe? In Yom Kippur war only American and possibily Russian  intervention  saved the Arab armies from total defeat. <br />I do feel that maybe too much  effort was  made to make it readable, leaving the reader with a series of  war stories rather then an informative discussion.	2000-02-26

Such as to seem to claim that Russia would have defeated Germany without the Allies help. It starting off with a  claim that the German initial victories were due to an accident of timing  due mainly Stalin's purges before the war. It implies the purges stopped.  It then argues that the Russian Army slowly improved and in time it defeat  Nazi German almost by itself.  That by the end of the war it was a very  skillful army that Stalin or his generals led well. <br />It does not refer to  the purges, both in the Russian military and general population, that  continued during the whole war and even after until Stalin died. For  example General Montgomary was shocked when his Russian hosts explained  that every officer in this army unit had been purged. Alexander  Solzhenitsyn was an officer in the Russian army he was arrested and shortly  afterwards so was his commander. In his cell it was full of military people  who were also arrested. His books make it quite clear these arrests were  being done on a major scale.<br />It goes to great length to try to show that  the Russian military defeated the Nazi's not by numbers but by skill.  Interesting although it tries to inflate the Nazi military numbers, nothing  is mentioned at all of the million Russians who fought for Hitler. On the  other hand German troops in Norway are added to Nazi army in Russia. I  would be very careful about using this books statistics. <br />The biggest  failure, I felt is that the most of the battles were badly explained. Who  and how the operation was planned? You do not know what both sides were  trying to do and the choices they could have made. Furthermore what were  the numbers on both sides, how the battle progressed and ended with the  costs for both sides.	2000-01-15

So its is true with much of the history  of the cold war. Up to now Western historians thought they  knew most of the story, only now to find out that much of what they knew is  based on having only half the story. With this book gives us an idea of  what the Russians were thinking and what their aims were. It certainly  changed many conceptions that I had  over what took place.	1999-12-13

The first part is pretty slow but later as you keep going you realise how the argument is progressing. I went over his calculations, and I could not fault the writers'  conclusions.   If you think how much effect mankind has just been  civilised on the world in 6000 years and then that in a relative short  period in cosmological terms, measured in millions of years, he will  colonise the whole galaxy. This brings up two questions. The first is why  has no other SETI race done it and two what effects will mankind have in  the future development of the cosmos.   It's definitely a book to make you  think.	1999-11-28

There is it little I found particular, interesting or new in what the writer had to say. I certainly do not feel that I have learnt a  great deal about this subject since reading this book.	1999-11-10

I found this book to be highly readable. It keeps  very much to the original story. Probabily as well though as latter books  in the series did. To the fans who want to keep in touch its a must read  but to others its probabily better to miss. I enjoyed it very much and look  forward to reading the next book in the series.	1999-10-26

The writer goes on and on about how bad reason is in today's society. In an attempt to prove this he uses very questionable historical facts. While reading it I found myself many times thinking these  arguements are not true at all.	1999-07-09
