Okay, so I get hung up on odd things when I approach such a book.  How  shall I read it? being the major thing.  That is, do I want to read the  introduction before or after I read the body of the work, and, more  importantly, do I want to read the entire David story and then read the  commentary, referring as needed to the story,  or do I want to read the bit  of story and the commentary on it on page 234 before I go on to the bit of  story and the commentary on page 235.   Well, even though I've tasted it  more times than I can count, I read the story first.  After all, I know the  story will be my favorite part  -- and why should I deprive myself.  A rip  roaring good story it is, too, the kind of story that lasts because no  matter who you are or how you read,  whether your bent is religious,  historical, or literary, whether you think the material came down untouched  to the present day or whether you think someone went back and added all the  boring stuff,  the story can stand up to the interpretation.   As for the  commentary,  Alter is best when he talks literary, when he shows the  the  insight, choices, the shaping, the devices, the vision  that mark the David  story a work of literary art.	2000-07-10

Fifty-year-old Sanders Roscoe sits himself down to tell us the story of Edith Goodnough and  Sanders Roscoe, of the Roscoe family and Goodnough family, of the High  Plains town of Holt, Colorado, from the late 19th Century to the 1970s.  He  shows us a woman who simply does what needs doing, no matter how staggering  the burdens may appear to us [including the twice-daily milking of cows  that, after reading Roscoe's heated description, the reader will forever  understand as not even remotely romantic or amusing].  With wry humor, no  shortage of anger, a good deal of plain speaking, and a pace that allows  for digressions,  imagings, and timely withholdings and revealings,  Roscoe  looks at the stuff of Edith's stay-at-home life and challenges us to see  her as anything other than heroic.	2000-07-02

For six years after his friend's death, unraveling Ravelstein is one of the tasks the would-be memorialist Chick is not terribly good at, even though his job is transforming people into words.  Marriage seems to  be another area where Chick doesn't shine;  his fourth wife is decades  younger than he, and had been a student of Ravelstein's.  Having almost  died himself, captivated by the joy of his continued existence and the  whimsical notion that he remains to do this duty, Chick gets down to it.   He puts forth words, a lot of words, many as intensely witty sentences,  repeating and repeating the stuff of Ravelstein's life as if the names of  things and events comprise a mantra, a way to penetrate the Otherness that  was his friend.  \\"... I would rather see Ravelstein again,\\"  Chick  concludes,  \\"than to explain matters it doesn't help to explain.\\"   Ultimately, this is a love story.	2000-06-22

For six years after his friend's death, unraveling Ravelstein is one of the tasks the would-be memorialist Chick is not terribly good at, even though his job is transforming people into words.  Marriage seems to  be another thing Chick hasn't been very good at;  he's entered a fourth  marriage, this to a woman decades younger than he, a woman who had been a  student of Ravelstein's.  Having almost died himself, engaged by the idea  that he has been saved so that he can write this bio, Chick gets down to  recreating Ravelstein on the page.   He sets forth words, a lot of words,  repeating and repeating the stuff of Ravelstein's life as if the names of  things and events comprised a mantra, a way to penetrate the Otherness that  was his friend. This is a love story, alive with wit and even belly-laughs,  about how love kills and how love saves.	2000-06-17

Intertwoven tales are composed of yearning and loathing, the magical and the mundane, expectation and dread, youth and age, imaginings and  realities, miraculous and carnal -- the very stuff of life and death.   The  book is large, sometimes bawdy, often hilarious. Each character pursues his  or her version of harmony.  In one of the most striking and ironic  demonstrations of power and creativity, Christian IV seems to have brought  forth the music he adores from the stone floor of a palace state room.  How  has he produced this wonder?  Dispatched to the cold, almost lightless wine  cellar beneath, the orchestra plays the music they must, glorious sound  that is conveyed to state room and ears by the King's cunningly engineered  system of pipes and grates and ducts.	2000-05-24

Her  themes are her themes:  flight, the journey, family, friendship, violence,  paradoxes of good and evil, world of black society:  its code, its  superstitions.  The ancestor.  The tar-quality of women.  Her main  characters always have childhoods.  She uses everything available to her:  awesome intellect, rich imagination, liberal education, the way she was  reared.  She uses fable, song, myth.  Masks and names.  Clich&eacute;s.  She  gives voice to everything that might have voice. Responsibilities and  choices confront the characters and us.  Presences and absences.  Her  sentences, her stories are comprised of what is said and what is not said.  Not victim literature, although there are victims;  she does not come to  the page to grind axes. Rather, she aims at things not being, &quot;Quiet  as it's kept... .&quot;  Forced to the extremes of life, her characters  survive or don't survive and their stories show how they do or don't  survive and do or don't find the resources to live &quot;intensely and  well.&quot;  She creates a world that includes rather than excludes, one  where much is tolerated and &quot;The End&quot; is just a stopping point  and does not close off possibility.  In a sense, The Bluest Eye  introduces a musical line, the melody, of a jazz composition, expressive,  flexible, various, full of call and response like gospel or worksong,  bluesy, vocal, replete with spaces to be filled by the instrument that is  the reader.  The sense of always beginning.  Reading Morrison's  fiction is a participatory event.  From the first word of this first novel  -- &quot;Here is the house&quot; -- she asks us to put our sure senses of  self, our belief in what we surely know, at risk in order the enter the  worlds she creates and be present in the action.	2000-04-29

Its passion, erudition, its hunger to find connection[s], to shape experience with language and embue it with meaning are of biblical proportion. City of  God is a composition of strands and versions, of voices and forms, mediated  by a witty and loving and ultimately humane god of the page.
