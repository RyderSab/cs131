US	52857394	R2ZUVLI8E72CP7	038546777X	128429641	Collision: GM, Toyota, Volkswagen and the Race to Own the 21st Century	Books	2	3	3	N	Y	Interesting subject matter	This was a bit of a disappointment for me:  the writing is not inspiring, structure is a bit haphazard.  It IS useful for learning a basic--very basic--grounding in how Toyota, GM, and Volkswagen came to be and a bit about what happened to them in the late 1980s and early 1990s.  She is appropriately tough on GM--which I suspect is her real field of expertise.  She understands VWs problems pretty well--they are, after all, well documented.  She seems to understand Toyota far less well--perhaps understandably; it's clear that it's just a lot harder to understand what's going on over there.  Of course with the benefit of hindsight the clearest flaw in the book becomes obvious:  she equates Toyota's problems with those of the other companies.  And seems to predict that General Motors will come out on top.  13 years after the book was published--today--I read that GM's bonds had been lowered to junk bond status.  Volkswagen had a decent run in the 90s though things don't look so great now; Toyota is utterly dominant.  Unfortunately the fact that she got that so very wrong--who'd come out on top was the subject of the book--makes me question almost everything else she wrote.  Too bad.	2005-08-26

It can only be that the book takes easy shots at the CIA and politicians--always easy targets and that the book came out at a time when everyone was obsessing about terrorism and our response to it. <br /> <br />If this was really the best field agent we had in the Middle East, it looks to me like there is more of an explanation for our intelligence failures than the politicians and bureaucrats back home. <br /> <br />In all of his self-serving description of his exploits in the CIA, he never seems to have prevented a single terrorist attack or have recruited a single valuable asset in the war on terror.  He savages Arafat for his terrorist roots, but more or less gives prominent Israeli politicians a pass for their similar history. <br /> <br />More importantly, he is a poor writer, the book is poorly edited, with spelling and punctuation mistakes, and his accusations of various players tend to be poorly backed up with facts.  (Someone in his line of work spells Caucasus as plural \\"Caucases?\\", like Iowa or something? Labels a C-130 as a c-140?)  Not damning mistakes, but not adding much credibility to a book which is so full of innuendo and unsubstantiated allegations that it could really use some. <br /> <br />I'm sure plenty of mistakes were made in the war on terrorism, in the CIA, in the White House, and elsewhere, and in all recent administrations--but I wouldn't take this guy's word for what the problems are or how to fix them.	2005-01-03

Nobody liked Orson Scott Card's great books more than I did:  Speaker for the Dead, Ender's Game, and the first few books of the Alvin Maker series are real classics.<br />Which makes my disappointment at reading Shadow of the Hegemon all the more heartfelt.<br />If you are a complete OSC fanatic, or a 16 year old science fiction fan, go ahead and read it.  It does have a certain amount of Heinlein-esque derring-do and fun.  For anyone expecting more from a book, like fully fleshed out characters, a fully imagined universe, or even a modicum of plausibility, you can do much better.<br />The story continues the adventures of Ender Wiggin's sidekick Bean from Ender's Game;  after being returned to Earth at the end of the Formic War, Battle School kids have become prized commodities and the ones from Ender's group become sort of pawns in an immense and totally implausible geopolitical game.  Inexplicably, one battle school reject, a psycho street kid from Bean's past, as taken over Russia and has led them try to capture all of Ender's team.  Petra is captured, Bean is on the run, and Peter Wiggin is on the way to not only becoming Hegemon but having a miraculous transformation into a nice guy, apparently because his parents told him (once) that they were as proud of him as they were of Ender.  A couple of leaks to the captured kids, except for Petra who's dragged off by the pscyho to India;  she inexplicably follows him around missing many opportunities to escape as he plots India's attack on Burma and Thailand, then all his plans fail but WAIT he was actually working for the Chinese all along, and Bean allows him to escape when he finally rescues her.  And Bean and Peter are so successful that China ends up capturing India, Burma, and Thailand whom they were helping...this is a dumb book in so many ways I can hardly describe them, but of course I'll try anyway:<br />a) Ender's Game had a level of believability because the war there was essentially a video game; it's easy to believe that kids would be great at that sort of 4 dimensional strategy.  It's almost impossible to believe that kids, no matter how smart, could have that sort of effect in a real world military campaign, in any century.  I've never soldiered, but I have enough respect for what they do to know that to lead them, there's no amount of genius that would substitute for some real world experience.<BR>b) Achilles is a ridiculous bad guy--he FAILED OUT of Battle School--so if Battle School was so good, why would he be any better than all the Battle School graduates?  Let alone able to convince three successive governments to let him run their country without showing any success.  This is so ridiculous as to be insulting to the reader<BR>c) Petra who is supposed to be tough is ridiculously weak and lame:  we hear about how she is battleschool trained and Achilles isn't so she can take him in a fight, but she only tries attacking him once, very late in the book, and lets him get the drop on her...she's alone with him and the prime minister of Pakistan and never tries to get away from him.  If the book were deeply written enough to imagine some sort of Stockholm syndrome at work, that she was somehow under his spell, it would have been more believable but that is clearly not what we are told.<BR>d) This is an incredibly thinly imagined and poorly conceived future world.  We're told in an afterword that he's read one book about India and one book about Thailand...but his understanding of geopolitics and of war is something a smart 9th grader should surpass.  China is able to conquer India because India moved ALL their soldiers to Burma and Thailand? Come on!  The geopolitics of the book have been compared to a game of Risk, and that's really about the level it is:  incredibly simplistic.  So simplistic as to be just dumb.  Reflecting no understanding at all of how relationships between countries, at peace and war, really work, and making no attempt to try and guess how200 years might change things.<BR>e)  Lastly, the whole issue of character and genius are just not working any more.  To write effectively about genius, the author has to actually SHOW the reader that his character is highly intelligent, not just repeatedly tell him.  Card is unable to convince me that any of his characters are really smart, which makes the whole house of cards fall part.<br />This is really a disappointment compared with good contemporary sci-fi as well as with Card's great work.  And very sad because of the quality of Ender's Game and Speaker for the Dead.  It is, unfortuantely, consistent with some of the mindless pulp he's been turning out in the last few years, like Pastwatch and the whole Homecoming series, and I'm afraid that the Alvin Maker series may have gone downhill as well.  Obviously I liked his best work enough to keep reading this stuff--but I sure hope he'll concentrate on salvaging his talent and deliver us something better...this is nothing but a disappointment.	2004-01-09

In addition to being the same dumb, hackneyed story lines and stock characters we are used to from the previous books, this one has the additional feeling of being pure filler:  in no real way does the story get advanced.  Arthur begins as a baby, and ends as a small boy.  There are adventures, but nothing important happens.  As usual, in Whyte's books, the bad guys are left alive so they can sneak up and do new evil, and as usual the bad guys are pure plot devices and in no way characters.  With all the (totally ahistorical) democratic rhetoric, Merlin's brother shows up out of nowhere and they immediately hand him half the power in Camelot.  Anyone who would read this, I guess, has already read the previous lame offerings in this series and doesn't object to laughably boring plots which rely heavily on coincidence, caricatures who never grow or change, and historical detail that sounds like it comes from a museum brochure rather than any real scholarship.  So go for it.  But please, if you want something exciting that will also make you think, look at the really good Arthurian efforts out there--Gillian Brandshaw, A.A. Attanasio, or Barbara Taylor Bradford to name just a very few...	2003-09-15

I am disappointed, however, to have it recommended by Amazon.com and, I admit, slightly embarassed that I dragged through the whole thing.  Haydon must have some talent to keep me turning pages through an amazingly inconsistent, poorly paced, and laughable story.  It is wrong to see this compared to Tolkien or even the better of the imitators.  Just plain false advertising.  Haydon is no where near the Jordans and Goodkinds let alone George Martin or Stephen Donaldson or the GOOD imitators..Of course, I was travelling and didn't have too many options.  If I recall the book has a dedication, acknowledgements, a preface, a prologue, a forward, AND an amazingly bizarre and mysterious probably time-travel-related framing story, followed by a very creepy little 13 page non-sequitur love story before we even really MEET the main characters.  If you like your women strong and beautiful and tough and funny, you'll like Rhapsody the character.  Though I'm not sure how many times I needed to be told just how AMAZINGLY beautiful she is, even before she walks through the fire and then gets reborn kinda as REALLY AMAZINGLY beautiful...as far as world-building goes, she may have cooked herself up a kind-of-interesting world, but then again a lot of it gets destroyed completely in the first third of the book without the characters having a chance to to do anything about it...we never very well understand Rhapsody's magic singing powers and get the sense that she does;  they seem to arise as needed for the plot at the moment; that's a bit typical of fantasies in general but there is an EASE about the way Rhapsody comes up with special powers that just makes it all seem a bit cheap.  Before we really even gotten to know her, her new pal presents her with the challenge of singing a giant world-sized planet-eating dragon to sleep.  No prob. Out with the harp, leave it on autoplay, on to the next adventure.<br />Also disturbing is the basic lack of a real thrust to the plot.  Since their whole world is destroyed in the first third of the book, the characters are pretty much left to their own devices in the second two thirds, and after doing some exploring they do what any of us would do with a bunch of superpowers and no real job: they start their own kingdom of civilized mountain trolls. Well, sure, why not? But it's all just so very easy....<br />Unless you like your romance with a VERY healthy dose of romance, or are 13 and a girl, skip it...	2003-06-10

This book captures the beauty and the tragedy of the west, is full of characters who are real and pathetic and loveable and maddening.  The territory of Western pathos and failed relationships covered briliantly by Richard Ford, but McGuane in this book brings a consistent over the top humor and sense of the ridiculous which distinguishes him sharply from Ford.  Picaresque bar fights alternate with lyrical descriptions of the fishing streams of Montana, the protagonist's series of soulless affairs constrasts sharply with his desperate love for the wife who has left him.  The book is fascinating, and beautiful, and terribly funny.	2003-01-11

You can see he already had the sharp, iconoclastic world view that makes so much of his later and better writing so good.  But this is a nasty and unpleasant book, and doesn't do anything to reward you for getting through it.  The characters are pretty much uniformly unsympathetic, bad stuff happens to a lot of people who may or may not deserve it.  Waldo himself is terribly hard to identify with...not worth hunting for.	2003-01-07

Instead of telling a poignant and interesting and perhaps moving story about a complicated family wrapped up in cold-war intrigue and general late-twentieth century angst and insanity, this is a book about books, and about writing.  If you go in for that sort of thing you will love it.  Far from being straightforward, the plotting is circuitous and completely unsatisfying;  the shifting point of view is so consciously experimental that it is almost a joke on the reader.  There is no doubt that John Barth is a lot smarter than most of us, and is a really brilliant writer and thinker.  But his brilliance keeps this from being a fun or entertaining novel.  If you like your reading experimental and self-conscious, by all means, pick it up!	2003-01-07

Lambdin isn't technically much of a writer and characterization is minimal but the pace is great and the author not only really seems to know his Age of Sail history.  The anti-hero aspects of Lewrie make a pleasant break from his rivals who are generally perfect.  Not as much of the fun bawdy sex in this one as in King's Coat, but its a plus.  Comparisons to Patrick O'Brien or even C.S. Forester are embarrassing and stupid--this stuff is fun to read but Mr. Lambdin falls well short of the master..	2003-01-07

I love Paul Theroux, but this totally transcends his travel writing.  Chatwin starts out describing a trip to the Australian Outback.  It starts out pretty conventional, in beautiful descriptive prose...but before too long you realize you are actually reading Chatwin's brilliant ruminations about the human race as a species, where we came from, and where we are going.  The book is NOT really about the Aborigines, though they provide a number of terrific characters, and I suspect someone who really wanted to know more about the actual Songlines could be disappointed by this book.  He very clearly sets up his own views against those of many important and popular thinkers.  To sum it up, he makes a case that humans are not really an aggressive species at heart, and that evolution has not really programmed the human to fight for power but to defend the tribe.  Not every will agree with this, but he makes a wonderful case and the book is beautiful and crystalline and should be read by everyone.	2003-01-07

But it's certainly pretty good, and I'll find out if the rest is better.  He captures a kind of crazed picaresque worldview which is something like E.L. Doctorow on drugs.  His disasters are gigantic, larger than life, and so are most of the characters.  It's hard to tell if it's magical realism or just totally unlikely, but it's funny as hell and a tremendously fun and quick reading experience--in spite of the mass violence and misfortune and desperate poverty it describes.	2003-01-07

This is territory already richly mined by Mona Simpson and other terrific authors--with the advantage of fictionalizing--but probably because it is true, this has more impact.  The quality of the prose is beyond my ability to comment on.  But it is by turns poignant, hilarious, and horrifying.  The characters are fleshed out and believable and perfect.

And of course, time travel.  Near-future stuff like this doesn't age well--I particularly liked the scene where the scientist asks the policeman &quot;do you know how to use a mouse?&quot; but this does flow fairly well, and has its heart in the right place.

There is enough life in this series to keep me reading found or borrowed copies though I certainly wouldn't buy it.  The characters are relatively engaging and flawed though of course oh-so-heroic.  The world gets saved every single time--there's no pretense of an actual arcing story here, every single doorstop-sized volume brings the characters and their entire world to (and beyond) the brink of utter failure before (somewhat cleverly) pulling all the chestnuts out of the fire.  Goodkind's weird obsessions with S&amp;M are considerably less evident here, and in fact the odd warrior/bodyguard/dominatrices are curiously endearing in this volume.  And the 850 odd pages do whiz by.	2003-01-07

In fact, it's suprising that anyone could make a story as intrinsically interesting as this one into something as boring, hackneyed, and unbelievable as this is.<br />It's possible that the Hemingway stuff is well-researched.  The author has clearly bothered to find out NOTHING about the spy business now or any other time, and not even bothered to try and come up with a believable main character.  ...On the idea that it's 95% true:  I'm willing to believe the worst of Hoover's FBI--but since the 5% he doesn't claim is true is the accusation that Hoover sold important intelligence to the Germans is so very unbelievable he and the reviewers should probably soft-pedal the idea that this is really \\"faction\\"....	2002-09-12

These are confessional stories about his childhood and early adulthood, and mostly are stuff you'd never want anyone to ever know about you or your family.  Some of the stories really are outrageously funny.  As a collection, it drags a bit.  These stories suffer from the lack of the particular lilt of the voice which makes him so terrific on the radio.

It does not, however, live up to the promise of Bonfire of the Vanities.  It opens in a smilar vein, casting a critical eye on a variety of interesting denizens of high-society Atlanta.  It falls flat when it involves Conrad Hensely, the huge-forearmed Everyman loser who ends up as the prophet of the latest cult religion--the return of Stoicism.  While it remains a relatively pleasurable reading experience, the last third of the book really calls into question what the author is up to--it was working fairly well as social satire, but when the last third rolls around, it almost sounds like a pitch for the Stoic religion some of the characters convert to.

It seems designed to work as a sort of anti-establishment fable, and some of the characters are typical of Crews' better work.

It's told through the tortured memories of John Brown's third son, Owen, who survived the doomed attack on Harper's Ferry.<br />The book pays little attention to the Harper's Ferry adventure and to the Browns' adventures in Kansas, and concentrates instead of the social and familial context of Brown's actions.  There is considerably more attention paid to Owen's relationship with his father and his obsessions about sex and human relationships than to the cowboy style adventures in Kansas.<br />  While it is written in a stately and measured tone, it does not have the feel of something written in the late 18th century, and Banks' narrator seems comfortable using words and constructions which sound quite modern.  Perhhaps because of this, the book never drags in spite of its enormous length.<br />The central question the book seems to me to ask his the eternal one about ends justifying means.  The Browns' seemed to know that the actions that they took in Kansas were morally wrong--yet they believed, and Owen believes at the time of the writing, that had John Brown and his gang not perpetrated the Pottawatomie massacre that the entire course of American history would be different.  They believed that the moderate free-soil politicians would have sold out, that Kansas would be admitted to the Union as a slave state, and that Lincoln would never have been elected and the NORTH would have seceded.  Of course we'll never know, but we have to ask ourselves if their actions were justified given what they believed.

It's clearly deservedly classic.  But it isn't a real pleasure to read, at least not for me.  The prose is so dense that you have to read every word.  You can never predict where a sentence or a paragraph is going.  Heller makes sudden, neck-snapping changes from the cutely ridiculous (like the squadron commander refusing to see people in his office when he's there) to really heartbreaking.  The genius of the book is not in the humor, which to me at least started to get old after a while--the genius is in his assault on the bureaucratic mind and the way he captures the feeling of men trapped in the inhuman machinery of war.  It isn't the most enjoyable thing in the world to read, but it should be read.	2002-03-18

As such I guess it should arouse some mild interest.  I suppose it can be seen as a real creative achievement since it's not derivative of anything except for ghost stories and Shakespeare. <br />It is NOT particularly entertaining for its own sake.  Pioneering as it may be, it is nowhere near as exciting or interesting as many stories that owe it something.  The language is stilted, characters flat, and plot ridiculous and at times hard to follow.  But if you want to see where horror and the whole gothic theme came from, here it is...	2002-03-18
US	52857394	RYDBZ9OMJFQ0J	0140254498	966843632	The Atlas	Books	2	18	29	N	N	A disappointment--self-consciously avant-garde	I'd been looking forward to reading Vollman since I have enjoyed writers he's often compared with, like Thomas Pynchon, David Foster Wallace, and Richard Powers. I still think the early American cycle sounds interesting and challenging, and I won't give up on him. <br />But there is nothing in this book to justify the praise being heaped on him. The stories cover a territory which few of us, even the very well-travelled, ever see. Likewise the characters are people few of us will meet and most of us would prefer not to meet. Even the narrator of the stories often seems hopelessly lost and debased. It begins with a forward clearly intended to be self-deprecating but ludicrously pretentious nonetheless. This is an appropriate introduction to the book since the prose throughout is some of the most self-consciously avant-garde clumsy prose this side of an undergraduate creative writing class. <br />Some reviewers seem to have the impression that all 51 pieces were carefully crafted and arranged for maximum effect--I hope if that were true he would have done a better job. ... This book shows none of the amazing control of language demonstrated by the authors Vollman is compared to. It's just a bunch of adjectives, mostly primary colors, strung together in long stream-of-consciousness sentences.<br />Pynchon and Powers and Wallace often seem to be saying \\"Look how much smarter I am than you\\" and while reading them I often think \\"OK Already, I get it, you're smarter...\\". With Vollman you just want to say \\"OK, I get it, you're better travelled than I am.<br />Reading the Atlas is like reading a book-length series of Granta travel articles, with the fascinating subject matter buried under frequently ham-handed self-consciously arty prose. Vollman may be a genius, but the evidence isn't here. If this is a smart and rigorous writer, he hasn't demonstrated it in this book.	2002-03-04

But it is definitely a quick taut intriguing read in a style similar to, but more accessible than, J.G. Ballard.  It's not as absolutely raw and shocking as Ballard either but there's still plenty of dark raw degradation to enjoy.<br />I may not share the other reviewer's absolute rapture with this book, but there's no doubt that it is a serious and well-written novel in the Ballardian vein.	2002-02-20

It isn't your father's Arthur--but it's dense and engaging and exciting.  I can see that some might be offended at the mixing of myths from different times and different places, and the addition of Attanasio's own &quot;backstory&quot;.  But we're talking about fantasy here, not some sort of historical treatise.  And the tradition of cobbling together Christian and Pagan mythologies into amazing fantasy was started with Tolkien along with the whole genre.  The lushness of Attanasio's prose may also strike some as overwritten but to me its brilliant.  This  is a sophisticated author at the height of his powers and he vastly outclasses most of the other entries in the field.	2002-02-01

For simply plotted well-paced space opera, this is it.  If you are looking for anything more than pure escapist romp, look at Simmons or something else with a bit more sophistication.  Well, honestly almost anything else would be more sophisticated.  It has the funny deja-vu like feeling that all good pulp has--but this is a real doorstop of a book which frankly put me off.  It's a bit of an investment in time for stuff that is really pure fluff.  On the other hand, as people have pointed out, Gear can and does deliver the goods and it IS reasonably entertaining sf fun.	2002-02-01

This is a complicated and mysterious book by a writer with an amazing command of his prose.  The tragic story is doled out in tiny slivers along with a vivid description of the imagined Mediteraenan location where the events unfold.  The narrator is a self-proclaimed &quot;love singer&quot; who is desperately proud of his marriage and of the many, many women he has loved during his marriage.  It's hard at least for this reader to be sure how ironically we are to view the protagonists advocacy of totally free love.  The narrator clearly blames the stories tragic outcome on the small-mindedness of his rival in love--I at least am left wondering whether the author means us to blame the victim or the protagonist.  The story can be oppressive at times with its pervasive melancholy--but it certainly makes you think.  Hawkes is a terrific writer and this is a challenging, difficult and definitely uncomfortable work of genius.	2002-01-30

I find the praise for this book contained in many of these reviews to be absolutely inexplicable.  I don't care whether it was historically accurate--Arthur is a legend, after all.  I actually like sex and violence, so I have no problem with that.  What I don't like are cardboard characters, lame story-lines, hackneyed plots.  To me it doesn't matter whether Whyte knows how swords were made in late Roman Britain. What matters is that he should convince me that he knows.  He fails utterly.  <br />This is a hodgepodge of lame action sequences and a tedious Horatio Alger story--the veteran protagonist conveniently discovers whatever he needs buried somewhere whenever he needs it...mixed with a bit of weird survivalist myth which presumably foreshadows the dark ages to come.  The central love relationship of the book is so simplistic and poorly imagined as to be insulting to the reader.<br />What kind of writing are this books fans used to reading?  Weekly World News?  I'm not saying that this couldn't make decent entertainment for early teens, but compared to solid and entertaining Arthurian stuff like Bradley's Mists of Avalon or Attanasio's series or Gillian Bradshaw's series?  Or several others?  <br />In no way does Whyte breathe life into the characters or the era which he so thinly imagines.  About the only thing you can say good about this book is that you can get through it in a few hours, typical of books with such poor derivative prose and hackneyed story lines.  A good thing it's a quick read--about the only thing about Arthur that's even hinted at in this book is the ORE which may be used to make Excalibur.<br />Great suggestion that because Whyte skips magic--funny since magic always seemed kind of important in Arthur legends--this should be treated as historical fiction.  Big deal. He's just as pathetic in comparison to great historical fiction like Patrick O'Brien, Dorothy Dunnett, or Alfred Duggan as he is in comparison to great or even just decent fantasy writers(Duggan actually did a much more sophisticated and thoroughly imagined real-historical-Arthur novel).  <br />If you are over 13 and/or read a book a month, you should stay away from this shlock.	2002-01-30

While not as incredibly as intense--or heart-rending--as Rabbit Boss, his previous novel, this is a gripping story with fascinating characters and puts wartime jingoism and xenophobia into an intensely personal light.  This is a writer who pulls no punches and can be utterly unsentimental.  He has an exceptional command of detail and pulls the reader along into a complex but believable web of intrigue.  Sanchez always avoids cliches (I wish I could!) and avoids a polemic, making his point in an engaging and thrilling story line.	2002-01-30

Ralph Leighton may well be a fun guy to hang out with, and Richard Feynman almost certainly is, but this book really has no reason to have ever been in print.  There's almost nothing about the obscure Russian province of their obsession in the book--it's mostly a chronicle of the hobbies of various people who are probably about as interesting--but not more interesting--than most of your friends.  The childlike enthusiasm they develop for the language and history of Tuva is charming at times, but after a while their relentless ignorance even of the most basic ways of going about collecting information starts to wewar.  Their insistence on providing direct translations of Tuvan in the original turkic word order must seem to the author to be cute--to this reader it came across as mocking the language.  Almost any foreign language would sound ridiculous if translated word for word with no corrections for grammar or word order.  Both grammar and vocabulary of Tuvan appear to be extremely similar to turkish, so they had huge resources available to them to decipher the language, but it appears from the book that none of them ever figured out that they were even dealing with a turkic language.  They never even mention the total lack of words for gender in Tuvan, or the lack of irregular verbs--a huge boon to a prospective langauge student.  I'm sure they're fun guys, but this really is a waste of perfectly good tree...	2002-01-23

The most insightful thing Kaplan says in this book is in the new Forward, where he says that it is frightening, if true, that the President based decisions about U.S. policy in the Balkans on information from this book.  If this were nothing but a travel book, it would be simply like reading Paul Theroux without the writing ability.  The pretensions of writing history and policy are truly distressing:  Kaplan rehashes versions of history from whomever he encounters without the slightest attempt at balance or even context.  He appears fully ignorant of the new look many historians are taking at the true effect of Turkish rule in the Balkans, preferring rehashing of gory atrocity stories to real comparisons of conditions under the Turks, the Hapsburgs, or previous bloody feudal rulers or oligarchies.  His comments about Romania, while visually interesting, are stunning in their shallowness.  This is probably because it appears that he was unable to get interviews with anyone very interesting.  I do wonder about Kaplan's general knowledge as well as the efficacy of his editors:  his constant references to crops or brandy from plums and prunes make it clear that throughout his travels he never figured out that they are the same fruit.  And his comments about Papandreau's stewardess wife possibly replacing him as Prime Minster &quot;following in the footsteps of Eva Person&quot; betray a startling lack of not just history but even popular culture...anyone who's even seen the musical knows that Eva didn't replace her husband....<br />This is really a deeply worthless book, save yourself the time and the money...	2001-08-09

The book is fascinating and different and fun as well as moving and sad and disturbing.  I'm certainly not qualified to say that the author's self-estimate of his book's place in Japanese literature is true, but if it is, Japan certainly has nothing to be ashamed of.  Murakami is right up there with Pynchon and DeLillo, both of whom he resembles in some ways.  The books weaves seamlessly through completely mundane daily life, horrifying events from the 2nd World War, and David Lynchian supernatural, inexplicable events.  It is intimidatingly large (though beautifully bound, for the bibliophile) but reads quickly;  even though a lot is left for the reader to try and figure out, it's a very satisfying book.  The best I've read in a while, by anyone.	1998-07-11

This book is really a collection of vignettes about an interesting and remarkably alive girl growing up in a quintessential middle American town in Ohio.  Like Mona Simpson without the emotional fireworks, the stories are sustained by the freshness and depth of the central character.  Her love interest is not as clearly drawn, but the women around him are carefully and poignantly depicted.  The whole story has a sadness and sweetness which is leavened by her keen and often humorous observations.  The stories are strongest when told from the point of view of the young girl, and saddest when the author assumes an omniscient voice.  This is good stuff, I'm looking forward to more from Lynn Lauber.	1998-07-11

This is a miserable excuse for a novel and an embarassment for Tad Szulc who is a really impressive foreign correspondent.  The novel reads like a child's fantasy of diplomatic life based on a simplified view of the 80's cold war and a half-understood Embassy telephone book.  The characters are miserably flat, the story sophomoric and predictable.  It's really surprising that someone of Szulc's gifts would have such an inaccurate picture of the way an Embassy works;  that would have been more than excusable had the story been equipped with a believable or interesting plot line or characters with any depth.  Even someone who really is interested in Embassies and loves Szulc's non-fiction should stay away from this garbage.	1998-07-11
