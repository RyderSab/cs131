Did the Catholicism of Luther's day teach the equivalent of the Judaism of Paul's day? Butz argues that early Protestant reformers did indeed misunderstand the Judaism of the time of Jesus. So Butz argues that to truly understand the Judaism of the time of Jesus is to understand the way it was understood by James, the brother of Jesus.	2005-09-22

During my first ER clinical I pulled the legs apart on a woman with a broken hip so that a catheter might be inserted, I listened to the ER head med complain that it was Saturday morning and you did not start the day with an MI, I listened to the PA joke about a patient with \\"fibro-myassia\\", and I watched the chief doc stonewall a patient because the patient seemed to think that his (the patient's) pain was all that mattered. No one ever died from pain, he said. Okay, think about it.<br /><br />Mark Brown would not have used one of my stories in his book. What he writes about is more outstanding. ER is the sadly tragic interspersed with the joyful or lovely. A vagabond who insists that she once attended Julliard returns with her violin and plays four hours of glorious music without repeting a note. On another night in another town, ER gets to deal with an unconscious male who had been playing sex games with his bound wife. When the husband knocked himself out, all the bound wife could do is hollar until the firemen broke in.<br /><br />I can hear Captain Picard from Star Trek issuing the command to \\"Make it so.\\" Gosh, I wish that the ER was the place to make it so. Sometimes it is. Sometimes it isn't. Sometimes it's the ER staff that survives.	2005-09-01

Of course, even before then, Peter the Great sought to import culture from \\"the West\\"<br /><br />(see the footnote on page 17).<br /><br />That which is Russian culture is a tapestry of cultures. The vastness of the land is well known, but often the vastness of time over which Russian culture has existed is often forgotten.<br /><br />Surely its roots must go back to the 9th century just before Kiev became the political center of a federation of states. It was another century before the Russians were converted to Christianity en masse. During this period, Russian culture was largely Byzantine in character. It was not until the first quarter of the 13th century that the Mongols invaded southern Russia.<br /><br />Russian culture is a tapestry of vast times and spaces. Orlando Figes weaves them together in his book.	2005-08-07

Then he got \\"the bug.\\" I can't think of a better way to describe that sense of duty and commitment that seems to possess people who are underpaid, overworked, and have to deal with the worst in our society.<br /><br />Like most \\"bugs,\\" this bug changes over time. Canning makes the switch from a high paying job to EMS out of a sense of wanting to help. I've known others like him. One fellow I know made the switch from electrician to paramedic even though it cost him (and his family) a third of his salary.<br /><br />In the beginning is the desire of the new EMT or paramedic to earn the respect of others in his profession. Canning was so proud as he marched into an operating room and established an airway with doctors looking on. I've known those feelings.<br /><br />The bug metamorphasizes. EMS people often have to deal with the poor in our society. This means a call from someone who has no health insurance and who has to depend upon an ambulance trip to an ER for normal health care.<br /><br />Or this means the poor in spirit who find nothing productive to do with their lives. For example this includes the elderly woman who calls EMS due to shortness of breath, and then she wants a cigarette.<br /><br />After a while in EMS you see plenty of folks whose lives could not be saved. The hardest is the feeling of \\"if I had been there\\" or \\"if I had made another decision.\\" Canning writes of those feelings. The bug has changed again from the time Canning was so proud to march into an operating room and establish an airway.<br /><br />Sometimes EMS burns people out. Canning was not one of them. This book is just the first that he wrote about his EMS experiences.	2005-08-07

There will always be someone writing a medical term either as an acronym or abbreviation, and I will refer to Jablonski in order to understand what was written.<br /><br />That's the positive side of this book. On the other side there are a couple of things that need to be mentioned. One is that for all of the definitions that Jablonski gives, there are still others that he left out. For example, take the acronym RAD. Jablonski gives about ten meanings, but \\"reactive attachment disorder\\" is not one of them.<br /><br />The second is that Jablonski does not explain his definitions. If one does not understand that \\"reactive attachment disorder\\" refers to a malfunction in the bonding between a parent and a child, one will have to seek another source.<br /><br />This book is great at explaining acronyms and abbreviations.

These are the words spoken by an air-evac nurse on page 187. She goes on to say that she had no idea what paramedics did. Scenes are uncontrolled chaos. There are police, family members, firemen, drunks, and a tremendous amount of noise to deal with. In all this you have to make split second decisions.<br /><br />Having been there I can relate to what this nurse is saying. EMS is training. It's glorified. It's put down. It's hard work. It's too long hours. It's a lotta things I hate to talk about. Karam writes about them, the good and the bad. Not all of my experiences are the same as what she wrote about. Around here 12 hour shifts are rare there is no way that one could get a patient to the hospital every 30 minutes. But Karam wrote about Newark, NJ.<br /><br />This job attracts people. Read Karam's book. The long hours and the relatively low pay can take a toll on your family life. Recently I had a paramedic tell me that he had not been home for eleven days. Any glory that there is in the job wears off the first time you get get called in on the carpet to explain something.<br /><br />So if you read Karam's book, you'll get a taste of what it's like.

Iraq claimed to be the victor even though the terms of the war were a status quo ante bellum. At the beginning of the war, Iraq had $30 billion in reserves.<br /><br />By the end Iraq was $100 billion in debt. Iraq's revenue was 90% dependent upon oil. One day after the Iran-Iraq war ended, Kuwait decided to violate it's OPEC agreement and increase its oil production. In particular Kuwait intended to extract more oil from Rumailah, a border region claimed by Kuwait and also recognized as a part of the province of Basra.<br /><br />Saddan Hussein decided upon a course of action.

I took my EMT training at a local college. Much to my chagrin, one fellow told me how sorry the college program was because it did not teach one how to take the (EMT) test. Another fellow told me that he studied for his (paramedic) test by going through as many multiple choice questions as he could find.<br /><br />I know at least one really smart gal and guy both of whom have failed the EMT Basic test twice. It takes not only a certain amount of training and education to pass the test but a certain amount of preparation as well. One needs to know how to take a multiple choice test where only the *best* answer is the *correct* answer. And one does not need to be stressed out by the time one takes the test.<br /><br />This book offers a \\"battle plan.\\" There are 150 questions on the National Registry exam. There are 24-30 on patient assessment, etc. This book offers practice tests so that one can learn how to deal with multiple choice questions with more than one good answer, but again, only the best answer is correct. This book helps one identify their areas of weakness. Patient assessment: 12 questions missed out of 30? Might be a good idea to review that topic. One does not need to get an A. One needs to pass the test. Getting better in a weak area may be just the ticket.<br /><br />Some people get an attitude problem. I heard one gal say that she got mad halfway through her test and just started answering questions. She got a 67. Too bad she did not keep her temper under control a little while longer. She could have saved a second trip to the testing center and all the hurry up and wait that goes along with it. During my EMT exam, it took an hour to get us checked in.<br /><br />Some people develop a case of nerves before the test. This book has some good suggestions. The only thing I have against the 30-day plan and the 10-day plan is that they go into too much detail. But some people do need help with a case of nerves. If you don't believe me, just listen to the talk of the people in line to take a test.<br /><br />One should not expect this book to give one actual test questions. National Registry now tells people not to even remember questions in order to rebuild the test. Instead the book<br /><br />tells people how to be prepared for the test, no case of nerves and a battle plan ready to go.<br /><br />For those who are about to take their NREMT exam... good luck.me people do need help with a case of nerves.

J Lawrence Pool was a famous neurosurgeon when he wrote this book back in the 1970's. Everything you as a patient should know is not the same thing as what Pool needed to know. This book was written from the point of view of what a physician should tell a patient who has some sort of ailment of the brain or nerves. Some of the information is no longer the generally accepted. For example, there are not 24 spinal vertebrae. Most of the time technical terms are avoided in order to ease explanation. But though the cranial nerves are not all named and explained, the ending of the spinal nerves is properly labeled the cauda equina (horse's tail).<br /><br />That's what makes the usefulness of this book questionable. Pool describes certain procedures as being painful. In the last thirty years some of these procedures have become less painful. Yet at the same time pain in the left arm is still a valid sympton for diagnosing CVA's.<br /><br />Something that might be interesting is reading what Pool considered topline medicine in the 1970's. For example as Pool wrote this book, brain surgery for a leaking aneurysm \\"can now be successfully treated\\" 95% of the time, whereas 15 years before Pool wrote his book such operations were only 50% successful. It never ceases to amaze me how much medicine has changed over the last ten years.	2005-03-20

This book is the result of the interest that so many have in the two and remains \\"as strong as it has ever been.\\"<br /><br />Friedman starts out with a brief history of the Holy Land which runs from 3000 BC through AD 138 or so. After a couple of maps and a few landscape pictures comes a section on coinage in the Bible. It is generally accepted that coins were first minted in Lydia (in modern Turkey) in the 7th century BC. King Astyages made his coins of electrolyte (a combination of gold and silver) found in the Sardis River. Yet it took another two generations for King Croesus to guarantee the amount of gold vis-a-vis silver in the coin. References to money before this time in the Bible refer to ingots or something else; they were not coins.<br /><br />Persia and Greece both made coins that had an influence upon the Holy Land before the coming of Jesus. Many of these tell us much about when and why they were minted. Ptolemy (314-310 BC) minted coins that had a striking resemblance to Alexander the Great. They were inscribed \\"an Alexander coin of Ptolemy.\\" By these Ptolemy sought to sell his people on the idea of his legitimacy and authenticity.<br /><br />Friedberg goes on for a few centuries. Christains will be most interested in his explanatins of the Widow's Mite and the Thirty Pieces of Silver.<br /><br />This book is great for people who want to make connections between the Bible and money. For those with more academic thoughts in mind, it is not so great. Mosherer is cited when it suits Friedberg. But the likes of Diana Edelman's article on tracking observance of the aniconic tradition is never mentioned.	2005-03-14

For the first time since the 1967 War, Israel acted unilaterally in giving final approval to a withdrawal from the Gaza Strip. Four days later, a bomb killed 4 people outside a club in Tel Aviv. Mahmoud Abbas, Palestinian Authority leader and successor to Yassir Arafat, took quick action to qwell the violence. Israel now blames Syria.<br /><br />_Israel's Fateful Hour_ was first published in 1986 in Hebrew. In four years it went through four editions. In the late 1980's the idea of withdrawing from occupied territories was a radical one in Israel. However the credentials of Yehoshafat Harkabi are impressive. He was Chief of (Israeli) Military Intelligence, Deputy Director/Adviser to Prime Minister Menachem Begin, and taught international relations at Hebrew University.<br /><br />Perhaps most significant is the fact that he had lived through the four wars Israel has engaged against its neighbors (he lived from 1921 to 1994), especially the Day of Atonement/Yom Kippur War instigated by Syria and Egypt. (Syria's Asad needs more attention.)<br /><br />In the late 1980's Harkabi was avant garde in his thinking but his reasoning was sound. By 1967 Israel had begun to annex areas \\"thickly inhabited by Palestinians.\\"  The choice was either to grant Palestinians full citizenship, in which case they would soon outnumber and outvote Jewish Israelis,  create an apartheid situation, or give Palestinians a land of their own (which would appeal to the tribal thinking among Palestinians).<br /><br />On one hand I want to say that _Israel's Fateful Hour_ is a time piece of the late 1980's. On the other hand the current peace between Israel and the Palestinians may fail. If so, we may again want to look at Harkabi's reasoning for granting the Palestinians \\"land for peace.\\" Harkabi is well worth reading.	2005-02-27

Positing that there was one is the best way to explain the 225 verses shared by Matthew and Luke. However its compositional history must remain a mystery due to the fact that Jesus probably said the same thing at different times in slightly different ways. Yet for Bock the verbal agreement between Matthew and Luke \\"should be evaluated as part of a tradition that had solid roots in the early church and as reflective of Jesus' teaching.\\"<br /><br />Scot McKnight begins the third essay by writing about the unfortunate happenstance that students of modern scholarship do learn modern scholarship but so often fail to learn the scholarship of the previous generation; it's as if B. H. Streeter et al are obsolete. McKnight then goes on to reaffirm that the priority of Mark is correct. \\"Matthew sometimes was a scribe using Mark.\\" McKnight concludes with a warning that if Markan prioritists don't get busy, deconstructionists will win the day.<br /><br />William Farmer writes a case for the two gospel hypothesis. Mark was limited in that he drew his material from Matthew and Luke. Quite often Mark either follows Matthew or Luke in its order of events. Farmer writes that this is difficult to explain if Matthew and Luke followed an Urmarcus or Ur-Mark. Besides, Helmut Koester of Harvard thinks that Mark was written after Matthew and Luke.<br /><br />Grant Osborne wrote the response to the papers. Source criticism has returned as an important tool in NT studies. Farmer is right in that Mark never disagrees with the order of events in either Matthew or Luke while Matthew and Luke never agree while departing from Mark.

In this part of the book the author offers the theory that the alphabet was invented by, not only Semites, but Hebrews, on the Sinai Peninsula during the time of the Exodus. Ouaknin writes that the reason for this was the Commandment not to make any graven image or likeness of one. \\"This prohibition on the image forced the Semites (i.e. Hebrews), who still wrote in a pictographic writing, to rid themselves of images\\" (p.46).<br /><br />The second part of the book shows how each letter of the modern Latin alphabet \\"has a clear line of descent back to the script known as Proto-Sinaitic (p.115) and so to images of things known in Antiquity. For example, the letter A comes from the image for an ox. This part of the book takes up 236 pages of the 369 pages of text. It is this part of the book that makes it worth keeping.<br /><br />In part three, Ouaknin brings up what he calls the \\"archeographic revolution.\\" This means tracing the origin of scripts no longer in use and how they evolved. Ouaknin reiterates his belief that L Benveniste was correct in asserting that \\"writing was born on Sinai.\\" For Ouaknin the \\"abstract form of the letters of the alphabet have a superior status to the pictorial form...\\"<br /><br />Unfortunately Ouaknin races through this more philosophic part of his book in only 20 pages. Broad statements are not explored more thoroughly. So the reviewer is left conceding that Ouaknin's connection of the letters of the modern Western alphabet is interesting reading. On the other hand, Ouaknin depends so much upon the idea that the alphabet was *invented* on the Sinai. In _Early History the Alphabet_ Joseph Naveh writes that the Sinai inscriptions are preceded by a century or more by those from Shechem, Gezer, and Lachish. Naveh is one of those scholars that Ouaknin would cite as a reference; I will be glad to accept Naveh's opinion over Ouaknin's.re by those from Shechem, Gezer, and Lachish. Naveh is one of those scholars that Ouaknin would cite as a reference; I will be glad to accept Naveh's opinion over Ouaknin's.	2005-02-07

The author has helped to ficilitate this impression by initially offering three \\"working assumptions.\\"<br /><br />First is that investigating terracotta figurines in what is commonly called Ancient Israel must take into account parallel inquiries from other parts of the ANE (Ancient Near East). Second is the idea that if one is to understand terracotta figurines from Ancient Israel, one must understand their historical ancestry. And third is the idea that regardless of where any terrracotta figurines might be found, whether in the trash or in a temple, they had the same *meaning* to their owners.<br /><br />But Moorey has not written a book just about Ancient Israel, but the ANE. The first of his three lectures begins(chronologically) with figurines found at Ain Ghazal (c. 8700 BC). The second lecture discusses figurines dated from 3000 to 1150 BC. It is in the third lecture that Moorey discusses figurines found in the territory of Ancient Israel during the time of the Divided Monarchy.<br /><br />Moorey is a brilliant man noted for his encyclopeidc knowledge of this subject. In his concluding remarks he notes that if the functions of terracotta firgurines in Ancient Israel is obscure, their disappearance is *more* notable. They disappear from those lands occupied by the returning Exiles from Babylonia. However in nearby lands such as Idumea, figurines were still found.<br /><br />So at last one gets around to what the above product review is all about.	2005-02-04

So then the question becomes: why read this book? Around page 46 of Hochschild's book, one finds Mr Granville Sharp, who lived in the late 1700's, throwing his weight against the institution of slavery in Great Britain. Sharp argued forcefully that the law allowed no one to be a slave in Great Britain. However case law on the matter was scanty. Even two centuries earlier King Henry<br /><br />VIII had had a slave.<br /><br />So why read this book? This book is about how another society besides our own proclaimed \\"liberty to all...\\" and mis-conceived what \\"all\\" really meant.	2005-01-11

At one time or another he was the owner of gold mines and coal fields, a railroad woodtie company, and a fur business. He also was the holder of several patents on the Montana Sharps rifle.<br /><br />_A Most Desperate Situation_ is an epic adventure based upon 1500 pages of notes written by Cooper between 1900 and 1910. The book tells the story of young Walter Cooper (who is sometimes called McGilvra, Cooper's mother's maiden name, in the notes) beginning in 1858, when Cooper was 15, until 1864. Cooper's adventures are more action-packed than a James Bond novel. He traps beaver with Jim Bridger, pans gold in Colorado, visits Kit Carson in New Mexico, and finds himself in more than one desperate situation with Indians and Mexicans. No doubt many of the adventures in the book are based upon Walter Cooper's own life.<br /><br />One shortcoming of the book is that it is uneven. By uneven I mean that portions of the book move rapidly from one adventure to the next whereas, e.g., the trial by the Apaches contains long pages of oratory by some of the characters who sometimes repeat each other. Another shortcoming of the book is that the adventures are not concluded. However _A Most Desperate Situation_ is a grand story. Too bad it took so long for it to find its way into print.	2005-01-07

The _Guide_ starts with about 35 pages of useful information such as how to get around DC and some of the history of the Smithsonian Institution. Then comes a quick survey of the different museums starting with that favorite, the Air and Space Museum, which is the home of the Wright Brothers first flying aircraft. And don't forget the Steven F Udvar-Hazy Center at Dulles Airport or you will miss a proto-type space shuttle. After surveying the rest of the Smithsonian museums near the National Mall, the _Guide_ includes a few other attractions in DC such as the National Zoological Park. A few noteworthy mentions in NYC round out the _Guide_.<br /><br />Of course, you could spend your entire two week vacation at the Smithsonian and never see it all. (Do an online search to see how big it is.) If you use the _Guide_ to plan a trip to DC, one thing I might suggest is that you learn to use the Metro (subway) system. The _Guide_ mentions it, but it is too bad that a map of the Metro system was not included. (Get one online.) If you buy the _Guide_ in order to remember a trip to DC, one thing that will quickly catch your attention is that the National Museum for the American Indian mentioned is the one in NYC. Either way, the _Guide_ is well worth it.	2004-12-16

If one surfs the interent for this subject, most often one will find this book and no other. But the book is not all that much about techniques. Rather most of the book, though not all, is descriptions of some of the various pick guns that have been made.<br /><br />Minnery's pick gun made from a coat hanger caught my attention. It's easy to make and I think it works better than the standard mechanical pick gun offered by Southhord and others. Also the pick gun made from a Dremel jigsaw tool caught my interest. Something that Minnery does not mention is making a pick gun out of a non-oscillating electric toothbrush.<br /><br />I know a locksmith that keeps a pick gun on a charger in his service truck. And I know one who told me he used one so seldom that he wasn't sure if the charger worked. They are not a guarantee that one will be able to pick a lock. So much of this depends on practice.	2004-08-16

She opens with a chapter on the effect of the environment on Egyptian health. Egypt had a \\"remark-able landscape.\\" The Nile was its focal point. Unfortunately it was this close contact with the Nile that led to contact with parasites in its waters.<br /><br />The evidence for the existence of disease is often the surviving art of the people. Yet art can be subject to ideology. Akhenaten is thought to have Froehlich's Syndrome. He is portrayed with feminine atributes. But those who suffer from this malady can _not_ have children and Ahkenaten had six. At this point the expression \\"go figure\\" comes to mind.<br /><br />In addition to disease due to the environment, there are congenital diseases, acquired disorders, and trauma. Seqenenre is the pharaoh who rid his country of the Hyksos. His mummy shows six wounds. Did he suffer these during battle? X-ray analysis shows that bone around one of the wounds had partially healed. So did Seqenenre die of palace intrigue?<br /><br />Two things need to be said about Filer's book. First of all, the reader will not need a medical dictionary to follow along. Filer does a good job of explaining medical terms. Don't know what anencephaly is? See page 63.<br /><br />Second of all, the reader may ponder the causes of death then and now. Then...in ancient Egypt sand was used to help grind wheat. Since it could not be sifted back out, it became part of the bread. Egyptians developed abscesses which could become fatal infections. Filer mentions (p. 76) that tumors were a feature of the elderly. Now... our longevity has been increased and we face those diseases which Filer found in the elderly.	2004-08-12

Included among the stories are Little Red Riding Hood, Goldilocks, Jack and the Beanstalk, the Pied Piper, and nine others. At first the retelling of these stories might bring a smile or two to the face of the reader. In Little Red Riding Hood, when Little Red is about to be saved from the wolf by the woodchopper, Little Red turns on the woodchopper demanding to know why the woodchopper thinks that womyn/women and wolves need a man's help to solve their problems.<br /><br /> The question in my mind is whether Garner has written a book of politically corrected bedtime stories or whether he has lampooned political correctness. Which side of the line is Garner on? In the story of the Three Little Pigs, Garner has the wolf huffing and puffing until the wolf has a massive heart attack &quot;brought on by eating too many fatty foods.&quot; At this, as one might expect, the three little pigs rejoice.<br /><br /> What happens next is that the three little pigs resolve to regain their &quot;homeland.&quot; They gather together other pigs and become a band of &quot;porcinistas&quot; (like Sandanistas) who attack a resort complex with machine guns and rocket launchers.The &quot;cruel wolf oppressors&quot; are slaughtered. Then the pigs set up a &quot;model socialist democracy.&quot; The reader need not be offended by the mention of a slaughter. Garner concludes by writing that the wolf in this story was a metaphorical construct and no wolves were harmed in the writing.<br /><br /> My own take on this is that Garner has gone beyond merely rewriting politically correct bedtime stories. However this is a judgment call and I leave it to other readers to read these stories and discern for themselves. Regardless of which way the reader decides, happy reading.	2004-08-02

Nolan finds Jesus aligned himself with John the Baptist, was a friend of the oppressed, etc. For example, the concept of the &quot;kingdom of God&quot; was a measure of Jesus' understanding of evil in society (p.61)<br /><br /> When Nolan wrote this book back in the mid/late 1970s the idea of peeking behind the theology surrounding Jesus of Nazareth was much more avant garde than it is today. He does not recast theology as does Robinson in _The Human Face of God_. But he does limit his the penetration of his analysis to the text of the New Testament and no more. For example, Jesus may have told parables about guests who made excuses (p 47) because he himself may have experienced the same.<br /><br /> Perhaps Jesus did, but in recent writings by Crossan, Horsley, Reed, and others, one may see Jesus as a peasant with few resources to host a celebration. In more recent studies emphasis has been given to archaeological data and sociological models in order to illumine the world behind the text of the New Testament. Nolan's book penetrates to the text and does not deal with these latter.	2004-07-27

I often think &quot;lie is too strong of a word. In reading history, whether ancient or modern, one gets use to the prejudices of the writer. Ancient Assyrian palaces bent the facts for propaganda purposes. The Egyptian version of the treaty with the Hittites and the Hittite version are both still extant and both portray a different view of the Battle of Kadesh and what it meant.<br /><br />In this sequel to _Lies My Teacher Told Me_, James Loewen continues his study of the monuments and other artifacts by which we remember our past. He begins with the western side of the US because, contrary to Euro-centricism, that is the side of the US for which there were first immigrants. They came across the Siberian Strait. Likewise Loewen writes that there are more tourists that come to the West Coast than than the East Coast.<br /><br />I want to balk that not all of the cases which Loewen presents actually represent attempts to purposefully deceive someone else. For example, I don't think anyone in Pittsburg, Texas, really believes that the Ezekiel Airship was an airborne airship before Kitty Hawk. However I cannot vouch the same for all of the monuments that Loewen mentions. Moreover quite often I am inclined to agree with him that the purpose of a certain moument was not only to mislead its reader but to create an alternative fiction. That I would call a &quot;lie.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Lie&quot; is a strong word, especially with regard to history. I think Loewen has found lies about who we have been and who we are. Perhaps the best part of this book is that Loewen offers us ways to identify these errors.	2004-07-12

Well... not exactly. Nor are some of the claims made in the preface of George Lamsa's translation of the Bible quite right. The first thing that one needs to know when beginning to study neo-Aramaic is where and when it was spoken and by whom. Wolfhart Heinrichs says that even for readers who have a certain amount of expertise in Semitic studies, this is &quot;mostly terra incognita.&quot;<br /><br />Neo-Aramaic is a term that covers the &quot;contemporary offspring&quot; of ancient Aramaic. Heinrichs divides it into four groups. The first is Western Neo-Aramaic. Northeast of Damascus are three villages each of which has its dialect of Western Neo-Aramaic. The speakers are bi-lingual in Arabic as well. Two of the villages are Muslim while the third has retained a Greek Catholic heritage.<br /><br />Central Neo-Aramaic has two subgroups: Turoyo and Mlahso. Turoyo is spoken in southeast Turkey by about 15,000 to 20,000 people. The population has been reduced in recent years by immigrations to Sweden and Germany. Most speakers are multi-lingual. They also speak Kurdish, a form of Arabic, and Turkish. Mlahso was spoken in a village near the town of Lice which was &quot;destroyed during the Armenian massacres.&quot; Heinrichs says that this dialect should be considered extinct.<br /><br />The third group is Eastern Neo-Aramaic. there are jewish forms of this dialect which are spoken in Turkish Kurdistan, Iraqi Kurdistan, and Persian (Iran) Kurdistan. Christain dialects are spoken from the plain of Mosul to Turkish Kurdistan to Sanandaj. In the 1830's American missionaries decided to use the Nestorian Syriac script. At the beginning of the 20th century,<br />nationalist thinking brought about the development of the identity of modern Assyrians.<br /><br />The fourth group is the Neo-Mandaic. This dialect is spoken by Mandaeans in Khuzistan in Iran but by 1990, no longer in Iraq. There have been some unconfirmed reports that this dialect is spoken by some in the US. The editors of this volume would welcome any new information on this dialect.<br /><br />These are the peoples who speak one dialect or another of Neo-Aramaic. This volume is a study of their language. It is a scholarly study. It starts out with what was in 1990 the most complete bibliography of everything written on Neo-Aramaic. Following are sections on phonics, phonology, morphology, lexicography, etc. For those readers who are not familiar with these sort of studies, this may yet remain terra incognita.y 1990, no longer in Iraq.

Quite rightly Collins begins his book with a definition of this genre. Apocalypticism is &quot;revelatory liturature in a which a revelation is mediated by an otherworldly being to a human recipient.&quot; Is that all? No, there's more that Collins has in mind. This revelation discloses a transcendent reality which envisages eschatological salvation (temporal) and another supernatural world (spatial).<br /><br />With this definition in mind, Collins excludes much which had been called apocalyptic literature. He excludes Akkadian literature and the more modern political apocalypticism (see<br />Zimbaro's _Enc of Apoc Lit_) and discounts Persian apocalypticism. Then Collins begins a survey of apocalypticism as he knows it, beginning with the Book of Enoch. The reader is then taken through the Book of Daniel and other 2nd Temple, Diaspora, and Qumran literature until one arrives at early Christianity.<br /><br />Along the way, what had seemed to be the parameters of a well-defined genre of literature have expanded. When Collins begins to discuss Christian literature, it becomes apparent that that book which had lent its name to Collins' genre of literature was not a pure form of that genre. On page 269 Collins must concede that the Revelation of John is not just an apocalypse but revelation _and_ prophecy.<br /><br />Collins concludes that apocalypticism was not just the work of one group or movement, but different groups during different situations aand time, and maybe there was no group or movement behind a particular piece of literature at all (p 281).	2004-07-06

The most notable idea is that the Classical Period dates from 300-600 AD rather than the 300-900 AD that is now accepted. The crux of this debate hinges upon correlations with the Maya Long Count calendar. To make a complex story short, the Mayans spanned their temple doorways with sopadilla wood beams which have been carbondated. The combination of correlations and carbon-dating prove the Classical Period lasted three more centuries than Spinden thought. (For more, see chapter 8 of Michael Coe's _The Maya_.)<br />Spinden also thought that the Mayan govt was largely theocratic (p 97). This idea has also fallen by the wayside especially since the further decipherment of the Mayan language. (To which Spinden contributed an insight or two. For example, after viewing a photograph from Piedras Negras, Spinden made the suggestion that inscriptions that began with bat heads<br />should be read &quot;here follows a name.&quot; Decades later he turned out to right.)<br />In all honesty this is Herbert Spinden's second greatest book. His greatest was _The Study of Maya Art_ (pub in 1913) because in it Spinden gives the first art-historical treatment of the Maya. Readers will see that this book (orig pub in 1928) has much of the same to say as that former one. Though much has happened since this book was written, the art-historical treatment is still the strong point of this book. It is the through this lens that Spinden portrays the history and culture of the peoples who once lived in Mesoamerica.	2004-06-29

What is needed instead is not just an awareness of more more artifacts, but an examination of the material culture that impinge upon Christian origins. Reed sees the real value of archaeology as being able to reconstruct the social world of Jesus and his followers.<br />In Part One, Reed considers the identity of the Galileans. They are not descendants of Israelites of the Northern Kingdom; there is an absence of settlements for over a century after the conquest of Tiglath-pileser. They are not Itureans; signs of their settlements may be found in adjacent areas but not in Galilee. The Galileans are primarily Jews; they settled Galilee during the Hasmonean period and used the same domestic space (artifacts and the like) as found in Judea.<br />Some implications for the Jesus tradition are obvious. The teachings of Jesus cannot be seen as some sort of Galilean Judaism over and against some sort of Judean Judaism. Likewise passages in Q which are supposedly based upon northern tradi-tions cannot be an attempt at reviving centuries old Israelite traditions.<br />Part Two focuses on two cities: Sepphoris and Capernaum. Though not mentioned in the Bible, Sepphoris is often used by biblical scholars to explain an influence of Hellenistic culture (such as Jesus' use of the word &quot;hypocrite&quot;). However most of the<br />Hellenization of Sepphoris came after the time of Jesus. Much attention has been given to the house of Peter at Capernaum. Reed focuses on the large fishing and agricultural village which was on the lower end of the economic scale.<br />Part Three reverses the methodological sequence of the first two parts. Rather than moving from archaeology to text, Reed moves from text to archaeology. Here Reed is attempting to show how texts fit the Galilean background and how situations in Galilee were worked into the text.<br />Reed is on target in his critique as evidenced by the misidentification of the Galileans. Also his book is well written and amply footnoted for those who want to know more.<br />Reed is on target in his critique as evidenced by the misidentification of the Galileans.

A larger version was hung in the public colonnade. There the public could see the known world as it stretched from Spain to Britain to India to Arabia to Northern Africa. For its time the map itself was a feat. A team of Roman scientists had poured over the charts of surveyors sent to every corner of the Empire. The map inspired the first tourist industry in the world. The Grand Tour of Antiquity started in Rome, of course, wound through the Greek Isles and Asia Minor, and then sailed up the Nile to Aswan.<br />Tony Perrottet calls this the \\"Route 66\\" of Antiquity and aptly calls the first edition of his book by that name. Inspired by the map, Perrottet decides to make the same trip. This book is a combination of what it was like to travel in Antiquity and what it is like to travel the same route today. Though separated in time by 2000 years, so much of travel is still the same. I cannot help but notice that Perrottet has written about the wilder, crazier, mis-adventurous side of traveling. His travels are like those currently portrayed on the Travel Channel. I cannot help but picture him with a sly grin on his face as he tells the stories of his travels. After this one should read Lionel Casson's _Travel in the Ancient World_ (which Perrottet depends upon quite a bit) just for comparison.	2004-05-02

Though Davies had been preceded by others, it was this book more than any other that sparked the Minimalist-Maximalist debate (see Ziony Zevit in Biblica 83).<br />Immediately Davies says that the genre of literature of &quot;history of Israel&quot; is obselete. Instead there are three ancient Israels: one is the narrative found in the Bible; one is the history of the inhabitants of Palestine during the Late Bronze Age and the Iron Age; and the third is the amalgamation of these former two. For Davies the &quot;ideo-logical structure&quot; of the Bible is the Persian period although a certain amount of material must have survived from earlier times (see page 91).<br />It is unfortunate that this debate became as volatile as it did. For example, five years before Davies' book came out, Norman Whybray argued that the Pentateuch was a post-exilic document. One might expect Whybray and Davies to be allies in this matter. Yet he and Davies find themselves at odds in V Philips Long's _Israel's Past in Present Research_ which was published seven years after Davies' book.<br />Davies has a fascinating book. However I hope that any readers will read some more and not think that Davies has settled the matter.	2004-04-30

And out of due reverence, I picked up my corncob pipe, packed it with my favorite tobacco, and began to indulge myself in a pleasure that I have known for years.<br />Hacker's dedication of this book to Joan reminds me that the first pipe I ever owned was a Father's Day gift. There was a paw print on the card indicating that our dog, Jacob, had given me the gift. I understood. It would be a couple more years before our oldest daughter was born.<br />Since then the number of my pipes has expanded and some have been retired. Before I read Richard Hacker's book, I knew that I liked to smoke a pipe. But my interest does not match Hacker's by a long shot. What might one want to know about pipe smoking? The origins? How to pick the right pipe?  Pipe accessories? Collectable pipes? Hacker puts it all into his book.<br />Though I smoke a pipe myself, I have to admit that this book is by the ultimate pipe lover.	2004-04-26

Most folks who read this review will probably know the story about Harlan being the real life character behind the story by Rudyard Kipling and the movie with Sean Connery and Michael Caine.<br />Recently I received an email of trivia facts. One of them was that it was still legal to hunt camels in Arizona. This was supposed to be true albeit the last camel hunted in Arizona was hunted in the 1930s. In the late 1840s and 1850s Secretary of War, Jefferson Davis, decided that camels might be cheaply imported in order to replace the role of horses in the Southwest desert.<br />Davis had taken the idea from Josiah Harlan. And it might been that the US Cavalry became the US Army Camel Corps had not Harlan misunderstood the resistance of American horses, mules, and cows to the aggressive camels. The Camel Corps was disbanded in 1863. Camels were set free in Arizona. &quot;Harlan did not care because he had another brilliant idea.&quot; This is yet another adventure of the &quot;man who would be king.&quot;	2004-04-17

The text was James Barr's _Semantics of the Biblical Language_ which by coincidence is the takeoff point of this book by Moises Silva. What Barr does is to criticize the _Theological Dictionary of the New Testament_ for confusing word meaning with a history of ideas. Silva's goal in this book is the &quot;relatively modest goal&quot; of establishing principals and methods for &quot;determining the most accurate English equivalents to biblical words.&quot;<br />I cannot help but smile at Silva's depiction of his enterprise as &quot;relatively modest.&quot; Already in the first chapter Silva wants to maintain a distinction between etymology and semantic change. The former refers to origins; the latter refers to developments of a word. One might easily guess that Silva prefers the synchronic meaning of a term, how it is used in its present context.<br />This leads Silva to consider semantic change in the Septuagint and within the New Testament. Then it is on to a discussion of Saussure's terms langue (the linguistic system) and parole (actual speech). Many readers will begin to see here that determining what constitutes an accurate translation is surely the subject of critical thinking. What is the relationship of words such as walk and run? At this point Silva prefers three basic categories for synonyms: objective, emotive, and sociological.<br />In chapter 6, called &quot;Determining Meanings,&quot; Silva outlines a method for understanding any text &quot;remote from us in time&quot; in order to reassemble a world around the text. Look at the immediate text. Look at the chapters which record the discussion of the term at hand. Look at the writer's teaching in general. Look at the New Testament as a whole. And finally, look at the religious environment of the New Testament. In his conclusion Silva critiques Bauer's Greek-English Lexicon. Bauer, too, failed to distinguish between language and theology.<br />Silva's book, though short, is at the same time very deep. I think I would do potential readers a disservice if I left them with the idea that this book is easy reading for the average person. He introduces his readers to many of the abstract terms of semantics. This might make his book formidable reading. Also Silva has a command of a broad number of examples from languages other than Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek. This might be distract-ing. On the other hand one might just want to know why lexical aids offer diverse answers to the same question. In this book, Silva has explained the why.inguish between language and theology.<br />Silva's book, though short, is at the same time very deep.

I would agree that this is a most apt description.<br />Currid divides his 13 chapters between an introduction and various portions of the Old Testament. There are six chapters on the relationships between the Pentateuch and Egypt, two on the historical books, one on wisdom literature, and two on prophecy. Currid is widely read on Egyptology and this comes across in his writing. In his chapter called &quot;The Egyptian Setting of the Serpent Confrontation,&quot; Currid shows the breadth and depth of his studies in Egyptology. Numerous Egyptian sources are cited showing the meaning of the serpent in ancient Egypt. Then Currid adds the battle of the biblical writers. Aaron's throwing the rod-snake before Pharaoh was an assault on the latter's authority since the serpent was a symbol of Pharaoh's. The reader might want to have a look at the story in Exodus again for the full impact of this.<br />Currid treats the biblical figures as historical figures. Moses or Aaron did this or that, etc. Currid does the same with Potiphar where he concludes that what can be known about Potiphar is &quot;not much.&quot; Potiphar's name does not tell us much about the station and function of a person by that name though probably he was not a eunuch. Moreover the name itself &quot;seems to be an anomaly&quot; if the Joseph story occurred in the second millennium; &quot;the name itself is primarily confined to the 1st millennium.&quot;<br />One would do well to read Currid's book for what Kitchen said: because the interrelations between Egypt and the Old Testament is much larger than most people think. On that basis Currid's book is thought-provoking reading from cover to cover.	2004-04-06

Before he has written twenty pages, Potter makes the claims that the contents of the Dead Sea Scrolls&quot;disturb&quot; all church-going people and make out-of-date _every_ version of the Bible.<br /><br />About 50 years later I think of the number of church-goers I know who have only heard of the Dead Sea Scrolls and the number of new Bible versions (ranging form the Good News Bible to the NIV) which have come into existence since. Potter's predictions have come to nothing and his book is now no more than an item of curiosity for those (of us) willing to read...a *wild* theory... once in a while.<br />I wish I could endorse this book because it points out a few things which are useful and accurate. Potter does point out that the New Testament was written in Koine Greek and not a classical form of the language. Also he is correct in saying that the true nature of New Testament Greek was not realized until the 20th century.<br />However Potter uses these facts to bolster conclusions which are otherwise unconnected. What does it really matter what NT scholars thought of NT Greek compared to the Dead Sea Scrolls? Not even Carston Thiede uses this argument when he tries to say that some of the manuscripts from Qumran Cave 7 are from books of the New Testament.<br />Read Potter's book only if you are someone, like me, who will read theories that are really wild just to see what they say.	2004-03-29

After one reads John Currid's &quot;basic guide,&quot; one can see why many past conclusions are no longer accepted and why there is a great debate among archaeologists today about what archaeology has proven. Archaeology is a discipline which continues to learn.<br />Currid tells the story of how archaeology of the land of the Bible began in 1838 when Edward Robinson and Eli Smith traveled the Middle East and identified many biblical sites based upon their modern names. In 1890 William Flinders Petrie began the development of stratio-graphy and its inherent notion that each occupational layer of a mound could be dated by its pottery. After WW II Kathleen Kenyon revolutionized archaeology by digging in small squares within a grid.<br />So, of course as methods change, conclusions change.<br />Currid has written a book for someone who has little prior knowledge of archaeology. One thing that is missing is a chapter on Ground Penetrating Radar. It is interesting to read, but as the subtitle says, it is a basic guide.	2004-03-25

If one is lucky enough to come across Terence Qualter's book, one might get the impression that it is out of date.

This is true not only of the art in Assyrian palaces, it was true during the Second World War, and is true today. Propaganda is not just lies; during WWII one of the greatest pieces of propaganda that the US had was the publication of US manufacturing. Since it was true, the Axis Powers had no way to refute it. At the same time, courses in propaganda were cancelled in the US because people began to understand the propaganda of their own government.<br />This book explains what propaganda is, how it was developed, and how it was used.

I want to emphasize that this was good fortune because when the reader reads Gordon's autobio-graphy, the reader may be a bit taken aback by an apparent amount of defensiveness and, conversely, bragging. Yet consider...<br />As it turned out I also attended another session at that same SBL conference where a paper was delivered on politics in the academic world. Politics in the academic world is a grad student finding a doctoral program where one's advisor or doktor vater has a similar point of view and will help promote the student into the academic world.<br />I thoroughly enjoyed reading Gordon's autobiography from his upbringing to his retirement. When he wrote that he had learned yet another language, I thought about the fact that he has had his method repeated on internet newsgroups frequented by scholars. When he wrote that his daughter read hieroglyphics at a museum before she could read English, I shared a parent's pride. And when he retired.... I marveled at the list of distinguished names of Cyrus H Gordon's doctoral students.<br />The word &quot;odyssey&quot; reminds one of Homer's epics of great men and their journeys.

Consider that the Book of Judith may tell the story of the time of Nebuchanezzar but its many parallels describe the times of Judas Maccabeus. Or the DSS commentary on Habakkuk probably shows that when the Mac-cabeans tampered with the priesthood not all of Israel was solidly behind them.<br />For many readers Nickelsburg's _Jewish Literature_ will open up new ways to read and understand ancient Jewish writings.	2004-03-14

Moreover after Christianity came along, &quot;late Judaism&quot; suggested that Judaism could be altogether ignored despite the fact that Judaism has continued to flourish for the last couple of millenia.<br />So Cohen's book wraps around early Christianity in terms of time and thought. There are no set time parameters. Second Temple Judaism was a religion &quot;of the book.&quot; No longer did Israel have political independence. Why did God let this happen? Part of the answer may be found in Jeremiah 25; Babylon acts as God's agent. Cohen says that basically Second Temple Judaism accepted its civil rulers. Second Temple Judaism opened its understanding of who could be a Jew.  Pre-exilic Judaism recognized only the immutable condition of birth.<br />Second Temple Judaism belief and practice dealt with matters such as how to balance order in worship with spontaneity. The development of the synagogue shifted prayer and Torah away study from the sacrificial cult. The attempts to identify the core of Judaism are reminiscent to Christians to similar attempts found in the New Testament. The liturgical shema is as close to a credal statement as Judaism gets.<br /><br />Cohen writes a chapter on community life in Judaism (mentioning guilds among other things) before turning to sectarianism. Various sources are considered for the Pharisees, Sadducees, and Essenes, before a few pages are written about the Samaritans, Zealots, Theraputae, and Christians as these existed within Judaism. The last two chapters are about the canonization of Scripture and the emergence of Rabbinic Judaism in the Second Temple and post-Second Temple periods.<br />This book is written by an eminent Jewish scholar who writes in a very readable style and who uses no footnotes to distract his readers. The book is very informative yet it was not meant to be comprehensive. The reader should bear this in mind. The reader should also bear in mind that if one disagrees with, e.g. Cohen's appraisal of the law-abiding nature of Second Period Judaism, one might want to consider that sup-porting evidence is outside of the scope of this book.

The original intent, says the author, &quot;was to fill inter-stices (gaps) in my earlier study _Canaanite Myth and Hebrew Epic_. Though many of the essays have appeared in other scholarly literature, several appear in this book for the first time.<br />Early Israel was a tribal league developed due to internal pressures such as the blood feud and exteranl pressures such as the highly organized armies of neigh-boring powers. Too there was a certain amount of kinship which was tied togther by religious unity. Cross calls this &quot;kinship-in-law.&quot; This is important because covenants were mutual; covenants with one-sided obligation were a later idea. It was this league which produced Hebrew epic.<br />The beginning of Israelite literature is the transition from poetry to epic (which is defined on page 29). Contrary to the claims of some scholars, Cross maintains that &quot;folk memory&quot; is longer than two generations. Bards, using various formulae, could keep the culture of a people clear although historical fact, as we now know it, was never the main concern. So the culture of ancient Israel was passed from poetry to epic. This can be seen in Song of Deborah and its accompanying narrative passages in Judges. The partitioning of the material as it passed into epic has been divided into the sources J, E, D, and P. Cross focuses upon the Tetrateuch because it escaped any systematic editing by D.<br />Now as to the matter between text and history, Cross proposes a study of the tribe of Reuben. This culminates in the conclusion that the Apiru were a client class. Personal names found in the Execration texts, New Kingdom texts, and in the Haynes Papyrus show the pattern &quot;client of El&quot; and so forth. Cross believes that the connection between &quot;apiru&quot; and &quot;ibri&quot; should be af-firmed. Though he does not mention it, he has an unlikely ally here in Niels Peter Lemche who affirms the same conclusion in his Anchor Bible Dictionary article.<br />Thus far I have summarized only the first 70 pages of Cross's book. By the time he is done Cross has progressed to showing the relationship between the stabilization of the text with the canonization of the text in the late/post Qumran period. Those who know the issues of this book will want to consider Cross.

The relationship between biblical history and a text that purports to transmit it has long been an interest of mine. Only Fundamentalists can not see that there is a difference between the order of creation found in Genesis 1 and 2. Long ago it occurred to me that the most appropriate way to analyze the historicity of the Bible is to compare it to other writings.<br />Walton breaks down the literature of the Old Testament into categories such as cosmology, personal archives, legal texts, etc. Each chapter considers the related material, discusses the possibility of borrowing, and suggests further reading. Most of all Walton discusses questions such as whether the Patriarchal Narratives could be personal archives. Though he is a Christian Evangelical, he is willing to concede that Thomas Thompson's _Historicity of the Patriarchal Narratives_ et al have made a significant case.<br />The whole of this debate will go on for years more. This book is for those who want to begin wading through James Pritchard's _Ancient Near Eastern Texts_ or Hallo's and Younger's _Context of Scripture_ in order to compare Israelite literature with that of surrounding cultures.

Avi Erlich has written a thought-provoking book in which he writes that Zionism is a particular form of nationalism which was invented by the ancient Hebrews. Moreover the ancient Hebrews invented an \\"imaginative link\\" between the religion (or law), the land, and the people. Erlich calls this particular brand of nationalism by the name of \\"intellectual nationalism.\\" He finds it not only among the ancient Hebrews but also in the Greek polis and in the United States where the symbol of \\"purple mountains' majesty represents the Bill of Rights and other enlightened values\\" (p. 259).<br /><br />Most of Erlich's book is a retelling and reinterpretation of biblical stories. I am not convinced that he proves his point for two reasons. First, a look into a sociological dictionary shows that a definition of nationalism is that it is an *ideology* which has patriotism as a central value and loyalty to one's nation as a conscious emotion as a goal. Except for the terminology, Erlich's definition of intellectual nationalism fits this definition to the T. So what Erlich finds as distinctive about his conception of the ancient Hebrews is really more common.<br /><br />Second, though Erlich is not dealing with his biblical stories as history but as a literary heritage, I think he does need to ground them in a historical basis. Another symbol of the United Sates mentioned by Erlich is manifest destiny. \\"The fantasy of manifest destiny allowed us to seize a continent to mark our values.\\" Manifest destiny is a phenomenon which can shown to have a historical basis. In contrast Erlich offers his reinterpretations of biblical stories.<br /><br />I spent some time thinking about the question of whether intellectual nationalism could be applied to another people, perhaps the Chinese. Who are the Chinese? They are really diverse groups of peoples united by law (or religion) which controls a geographical area. Though times have changed, their religion used to be called Mao-ism. Yet even though times have changed, these peoples still have emotional ties to their nation. So why does Erlich not consider the Chinese as having intellectual nationalism?<br /><br />Erlich's book rates four stars for having to think about his ideas for a while., these peoples still have emotional ties to their nation.

Quite often it has been taught that writing began in Uruk sometime around 3000 BCE. Or that once the Rosetta Stone had been found, Egyptian hieroglyphics were a snap. Or that once it was recognized that Linear B was Greek, it, too, was a snap; just plug Greek words into a new script. This book dispels those ideas as it tells in detail the stories of the discovery and decipherment of those writing systems along with the Semitic alphabet, Greek inscriptions, and what may seem to be the odd man out, Etruscan.<br />The essay on Etruscan may help one to understand what this book is all about. Etruscan is not a member of the Indo-European family of languages. Rather it is an isolated language. Its literature disappeared about the 3rd century BCE. It is an unknown language in a known script (the exact opposite of Linear B), an adopted Greek script whose alphabet gave it the letters B, D, G, and O which it never used. This latter is like adoption of the Latin alphabet by the Italians. K, J, W, and Y never ever appear in Italian words. There are some 13,000 inscriptions of Etruscan extant and more are being found. A short grammar helps one to understand why the language turned out as it did. Languages, like a plant, grow every which way. Yet this essay is not just about Etruscan. There were other non-Latin languages spoken in Italy. Among them was Oscan which was spoken at Pompeii.<br />For all of the diversity of these ancient writing systems, their writers shared some common beliefs. Among hieroglyphic funery inscriptions a person's name had to be made known to insure benefits. Among the Etruscans, when one wrote down another's name, one acted upon it for good or evil. Saying or writing a name had power in a way that we do not conceive of in modern times.<br />People will continue to seek who they are by seeking who they were. This can be done only by reading the thoughts of those who lived in the past. This will be the continuing fascination with &quot;reading the past.&quot;be done only by reading the thoughts of those who lived in the past.

(Somewhere else I read an admonition to sell other books in order to buy a LXX. Was it Klein, 1987?)<br />However most of McLay's book is not about LXX influence but about translation problems which he calls Translation Technique and abbreviates as TT because of his frequency of use. This is not easy reading for someone who has no interest in problems of translation. I think many readers will agree that a quote of the OG is not a sufficient proof of a citation. By the middle of the book when McLay lays the foundation of his TT, many readers may be bewildered by McLay's assertions that TT is primarily synchronic, accounts for langue and parole, is structural, and takes the source language as a point of departure.<br />Only in a final chapter does McLay discuss use of the LXX in the NT. Here he concludes that the use of the LXX by the early church means that the LXX was recognized as Scripture, the LXX influenced the NT by giving it such terms as DOXA and KURIOS, the citation of the OG of Daniel 7.13 had an influence upon NT theology, etc. I think it is too bad that McLay did not spend more of his time on this type of subject matter rather than spending so much on problems of translation.	2004-01-19

The basic theme of the book is that there is a common Arab mind among those who are Arabic speakers. They share a common idea of unity. To put it in basic terms, this common idea is that the Bedouin life is idealized. Men are more highly valued than women and have more rights. Exaggerative speech (threats) is a substitution for action. And unity to the group is highly prized. So when conflicts break out, mediation is necessary.<br />If one had read the chapters which discuss the above, one might wonder why a US Army Colonel would write such a raving foreward to the 2002 edition. On might wonder what the above has to do with the events which have shaped our lives over the last couple of years. Then one would come to page 270 Patai begins to discuss the complacency of the Arab mind over the last millenium (a mind which idealizes Bedouism).<br />On to page 309 where Patai records an anonymous critic who wrote: &quot; Western colonialism is the single cause of ignorance, poverty, and sickness; Western colonialism alone is responsible for the diseases rampant is Arab lands, and the bloody tragedy called Palestine.&quot;<br />This is a lesson from the past to be learned. And it is a two-edged lesson. Recently I spoke with an acquaitance of mine who is French and asked why the French did not share the US enthusiasm for the Iraqi War. In a word she replied: Algeria. Patai points out the deep inroads of French culture upon North Africa. History shows the expense and results of the French excursion.	2004-01-04

For me the major portion of the book has been a compulsive argument for the existence of God ever since. The argument runs somewhat as follows. If the existence of the cosmos needs to be explained and if it can not be explained by natural causes, then it must be explained by supernaural causes. The existence of the cosmos is contingent; the present cosmos might have been other in its order and arrangement. The cosmos is a random one with a random number of dimensions. (I especially liked this part of the argument.) It is necessary to posit God as a preservative agent. For me this argument has been compulsive for about 20 years.<br />In the epilogue, Adler goes on to say something very important and that is that natural theology has its limits. The nature of God, the place of humans in the cosmos, divine law and grace, etc. belong to sacral theology and &quot; have no place in natural theology.&quot;	2003-12-28

Right away Schonfield tells his readers that the book is &quot;the outcome of an endeavor which has extended over 40 years to discover who the 'man' (quotes mine) really was. However, rather than publishing this in a scholarly book, Schonfield aims his writing toward the general public in a commercial enterprise. What this means is that the author gets to make unsubstantiated assertions and does not have to field points of view contrary to his own.<br />So for Schonfield, Jesus became a Galilean who was caught up by his times. There was a great deal of messianic expectancy in Galilee and the Scriptures were reinterpreted to pertain to current events. One can find this same technique in the Dead Sea Scroll pesharim. For the pious in Israel, Rome was the archenemy,<br />the Fourth Kingdom foretold by Daniel 7. Jesus came to believe that he was the Messiah endowed with the spirit of wisdom. According to the Scriptures, he would die on the cross and then be resurrected. This would save Israel from the Romans.<br />With meticulous detail Jesus plans his own execution and resurrection. Yes, there would be torture, but that was predicted by Scripture. But crucifixion was not always fatal. Josephus records an interesting story about some who were saved after being crucified. Jesus planned to stay on the cross for only a few hours. He would try to appear dead. The vinegar on the sponge was supposed to be a drug. Then he would try to get into the hands of some close, trusted friends who would resuscitate him. The plan would have worked had not Jesus been thrust in the side with a lance. For a short period of time on Saturday night Jesus regained consciousness and then succumbed.<br />I have a few objections to Schonfield's book. For the moment I will grant that he was writing as a historian and not as a theologian. Among other things, this allows him to not consider anything which might be known as miraculous.<br />My first objection is that Schonfield has to account for the formation of the early church. He does this by quickly sketching in a few post-resurrectional stories. The angel at the tomb is really the young man who gave Jesus the vinegar at the cross. The man encountered by Mary in the garden is a Jesus imperson-ator as are the man encountered by the two disciples on the road to Emmaus.<br />All of this was supposed to have been planned by Jesus at least some of which was planned on Saturday night when Jesus regained consciousness for a short period of time. Proposing these posthumous manipulation of events stretches credulity. Moreover the whole theory proposes that there were the Twelve Disciples and then there was an inner circle closer to Jesus. One would think that later traditions would know something more about them than an obscure comment.<br />My second objection is that Schonfield writes that the Romans were the enemy of the pious of Israel. But on page 143 Jesus manipulates the situation so that the Chief Priests were forced to move against him. Then on page 145 the Chief Priests have bring &quot;strong pressure&quot; on Pilate so they pack his courtyard with their own henchmen. This sounds like Jesus had another opponent than Rome.<br />Now I will get back to the idea that Schonfield was writing as a historian rather than a theologian. Schonfield is a Jewish Nazorean. He starts out his book with a question that he asked of his &quot;Christian friends&quot; if it would not be enough if they believed in One God and believed in Jesus as his messianic messenger. On page 141 he points out that early Nazoreans knew nothing of Trinitarianism. He concludes Part 1 of his book with a short homily about &quot;the young Jew, there was the Man.&quot; So on the contrary, Schonfield permeates his book with his theology.<br />This book should never have made the explosion that it did.as miraculous. <br />My first objection is that Schonfield has to account for the formation of the early church.

Most often these things have something to do with computers or medicine.<br />_Ancient Inventions_ reminds me that a lot of things that we assume to be recent are really quite old. The ancient Egyptians used antibiotics contained in moldy bread to heal wounds. Maybe we moderns did not think of the idea first after all; maybe we don't have a patent.<br />And then there are some ideas that the ancients had that we moderns may have not thought of. We have bull fighting, but how about bull leaping?

In this book Hoerth et al present concise studies of a dozen peoples known from the Old Testament and include the Sumerians for what really is good measure due to their heritage to the Ancient Near East. The book is organized by geographic area. In Mesopotamia are the Babylonians, Assyrians, Persians, and of course the Sumerians. Along the coast of the Mediter-ranean Sea are the Hittites, Canaanites, Phoenicians, Arameans, Philistines, and Egyptians. In the transjordan area are the Ammonites, Moabites, and the Edomites.<br />The scholarship is generally conservative. Many readers will recognize the names of Edward Yamauchi and James K Hoffmeier. Other readers will notice that David Howard struggles to coincide the archaeological data concerning the origin of the Philistines with the patriarchal history found in Genesis. Readers will also notice that the three articles on the transjordan peoples emphasize their existence at a time when the Exodus could have occured. However this latter is just a matter of emphasis as Gosta Ahlstrom allows for the same in his _History of Ancient Palestine_.<br />Though the book is now about ten years old, it is still generally solid in scholarship. One exception would be in Keith Schoville's article on the Canaanites and Amorites where he cites Giovanni Pettinato's claim that the name &quot;Canaan&quot; was known from the Eblaite texts of 2250 BCE. Many of Pettinato's claims on the connections between Ebla and the Old Testament no longer stand up.<br />Overall _Peoples_ is a worthy and interesting read. Many readers will want to pull out a map in order to follow along.	2003-12-11

The beginning is gripping. The curator of the Louvre is murdered, but his murderer allows him enough time to die that he can form his body into a *symbol.* Next the police are rousing from a too short sleep the protagonist of the story who happens to be a renouned professor of *symbology* from Harvard University. So far, so good.<br />Then the novel bogs down. Key to Brown's story is his interpre-tation of Da Vinci's &quot;Last Supper.&quot; Each participant at the Supper has his own goblet. Supposedly this means that Da Vinci did not mean that the Holy Grail was a goblet. Brown does not mention that there are other historical discrepencies such as Jesus and the Disciples are sitting rather than reclining. The Disciple to the left of Jesus supposedly has the figure of a woman. If so, this Disciple is not the bustiest. Jesus and this Disciple supposedly wear the same colors of clothing. However many characters in the painting wear blue and red.<br />The reader needs to allow Brown some latitude to tell his story. However it is distracting to read that (p 245) one of the characters pulled a book called _The Gnostic Gospels_ off the shelf and proclaimed that it contained &quot;photocopies (really?) of the Nag Hammadi and the Dead Sea Scrolls.&quot; Enjoy the mystery, but don't get get caught up with it.	2003-11-30

Pedersen begins by saying that there are a number of candidate sites which could have made his survey, but information about them was lacking. Pedersen then offers a survey of libraries for which there is adequate information available. He organizes his material according to geographic and chronological area. These include the Hittite, Middle Assyrian, Persian, and Western Alphabetic areas. Pedersen offers archaeological descriptions of the libraries and, quite often, diagrams, as well. The reader should note that contents of these libraries are described yet this book is not a collection of texts.<br />In a final section Pedersen summarizes his data. Clay post and other containers were used to store the texts. Where these containers were made of wood or some other perishable item, they have not been preserved. The same is true of shelving. The library at Sippar is the oldest library with the texts found standing in their original positions. Only 21 libraries contain 1000 to 30,000 texts. The rest contain fewer. The writing materials of the period studied are clay, ostraca, wood, leather, and papyrus. Leather and papyrus have survived only under good climactic conditions. The most common langauge was Akkadian and the most common script was cuneiform. However some alphabetic texts are known. Dating the libraries is a complex matter, but interestingly, no libraries are known from the 10th cenury BC. One might think that lifespans of libraries of public institutions lasted longer than family libraries, but administrative libraries lasted about one to five years.<br />Pedersen concludes that all of our knowledge of ANE libraries is dependent upon: 1) the extent written documentation was used, 2) the proportion of texts preserved through the accidents of history, 3) the quality of the archaeological excavations, and 4) the completeness of information about the libraries available.4) the completeness of information about the libraries available.	2003-11-21

This book presents a series of scholarly papers which show new studies of the social and economic use of coins and money in the Greek world.<br />Kim begins with a paper in which he shows that coins were a symbol as well as a commodity. Other societies bordering the Greek world (especially the Phoenicians) did not develop coinage for a century after the Greeks. Trevett explores the relation-ship between coinage and democracy at Athens. Democracy could not have existed without coinage. Oliver raises the question of whether or not Macedonian political control have an effect on the Athenian ability to issue coins. Meadows asks a similar question concerning the eastern Hellenisitic world. Von Reden argues that in Ptolemaic Egypt, coinage became a crucial bond between the central and local rulers. Ashton writes about the effects of the output of coinage from Rhodes from 408 to 190 BC. Davies writes about how coinage transformed \\"the ways in which the assets of collectives, cults, and sanctuaries were held, regarded, and used.\\" Shipton studies the relationship between the State and those who owned state-owned property. And Rowlandson studies the records of Egypt for the relationship between peasants and wealthy landlords.<br />It should be pointed out to the reader that this book is an attempt to bridge the gap between numismatists and scholars of ancient history. Ashton's paper is as dry as any economics paper can be. The book is concluded with 12 plates of 350 or so coins from the Hellenistic world.	2003-11-12

Instead such a person ought to read C K Barrett's _New Testament Background_. Barrett includes half a dozen sample texts along with texts which illuminate other aspects of Christian origins.<br />What the reader gets in this book is Coptic and Greek texts of ritual power, i.e. magic. There are spells of healing and spells of protection from harm. There are also curses. In one text a woman named Mary appeals to three archangels to &quot;bring away&quot; a woman by the name of Martha. Mary's appeal is rather vicious in that she seeks to have Martha suffer an ulcerous tumor or to pour forth worms. It is significant that Mary considers this &quot;punishment&quot; for Martha. She then appeals to &quot;lord Jesus Christ&quot; to dissipate any hope that Martha might have.<br />Personally I find magical incantations distasteful. They represent the worst in people. What can not be gained by the legitimate rules of a society are attempted to be gained by invoking the power of a supernatural being. Such selffishness would not seem to be in alignment with what Christianity proclaims.<br />Meyer has collected a number of Coptic texts from the early centuries of Christianity which are texts of ritual power. Since there are thousands of un-recorded Coptic texts in the Berlin Museum alone, one can not say that Meyer has a comprehensive collection. Nevertheless he has collected texts for diverse situations and events. And most helpfully, he has added numerous notes to help the reader toward understanding.	2003-09-22

The rapid growth of Christianity during the first four centuries of the Common Era confirm this.<br />For readers who have such an idea of early Christianity, this book may be an eye-opener, perhaps one of the most significant books one ever reads. Robert Wilken does an excellent job of describing the attitudes of the Romans toward Christianity as it grew. Pliny the Younger, Tacitus, and Seutonius saw Christianity as a &quot;superstition,&quot; a foreign cult whose practices stood outside the accepted standards of religion in the Greco-Roman world. Galen saw Christianity as a philosophical way of life but found its members dogmatic and uncritical in their thinking. Celsus saw Jesus as a magician and accused Christians of magic. (See _Ancient Christian Magic_ by Marvin Meyer) Celsus was also concerned about Christians becoming a counterculture that<br />&quot;drained their energies away from the larger society.&quot; Porphyry was considered by Augustine the &quot;most learned of scholars&quot; yet when Porphyry heard Origen attempt to reconcile Christianity with the Greek intellectual tradition, he thought it an<br />&quot;absurdity.&quot; The last Roman persecution of Christians took place under the reign of Maximin Daia, an emperor who took piety seriously. A later emperor, Julian, earned the name &quot;apostate&quot; for being raised as a Christian and then rejecting Christianity.<br />Since it first began, Christianity has not only been championed by intelligent people but questioned seriously by some as well. Adolf von Harnack once wrote that Porphyry's objections had not yet been answered in his own day. Christianity did spread rapidly, but that the message of Christianity was readily accepted at face value is not the reason for this growth. For that one must look elsewhere.essage of Christianity was readily accepted at face value is not the reason for this growth. For that one must look elsewhere.	2003-09-21

It was an artillery unit and this book was my introduction to Civil War artillery. Dean Thomas writes an excellent introduction starting his readers with organization and drill. Many readers may have known that sponging the barrel cooled it, but they may not have thought about the added effect of extinguishing any smoldering cartridge bags. Thomas then leads his readers through ordnance and types of cannons (where, when, and how used), and concludes with implements used with the cannons. To top it all off Thomas supplies his readers with a lavish supply of actual Civil War photographs.	2003-09-11

One of the things different about this rating system was that it was put together by interviewing students who had been to these colleges. Well... who better?<br />One of the 351 was a technology institute in New Jersey. What kind of place was that? The book said that it gave a lot of bang for the buck even though there was a high cost of living in the area. Small student to teacher ratio. Musical organizations were not popular. Very little beer or liquor use among the students. Most students were commuters. Of course this meant that there was a lack of community life. I figured a lot of students commuted in order to better their careers rather than get their first experience of college.<br />The college with the best academic rating was Yale. My college was not listed at all. Drat. Even so Best 351 tries to take the PAIN out of APPLICATION. I think it does a great job.	2003-09-03

The word \\"gospel\\" comes from a Greek term \\"euangelion\\" which means \\"good news.\\" Within the New Testament the term refers to the message of Jesus, but eventually the term was applied to numerous formats for carrying the message. _The Complete Gospels_, as Robert Funk writes in the foreward,  is \\"a bold step in gathering all the surviving gospels (from the early Christian era)... into one volume.\\" In addition to the canonical gospels, there are sayings gospels, infancy gospels, Jewish-Christian gospels, as well as gospel fragments. The translations are fresh and _very_ readable. Each text is introduced and notated with parallel readings and minor commentary. For example, the editors write that saying #82 of the Gospel Of Thomas may have been based upon a proverb of Aesop. And as a little extra there are cameo insertions on topics ranging from how to translate \\"basileia tou theou\\" (kingdom of God) to an English representation of a column of Codex Sinaiticus.<br />To put it simply, this is an outstanding work.	2003-08-16

For Barnes, one can not know very much about Rock Art, the subject of his book. For beginners, Barnes questions the adequacy of the term \\"rock art.\\" He finds it \\"flawed and semantically misleading.\\" yet he uses the term anyhow.<br />Barnes fairs little better when making assertions. On page 58 he says that \\"it is possible to assign some canyon country rock art to particular prehistoric cultures.\\" However Barnes obliges with only one sentence of details, a generalization which he then qualifies.<br />Barnes does not know who created the petroglyphs and pictographs of the Four Corners area. He does not know when they were created. He does not know to which culture they belong. Too much of Barnes' book is marred by his pervasive uncertainty.

Since the 7th century Palestine had been predominantly Arab. For example a 1922 census showed that 78% of the population was Arab. With the creation of Israel in 1948 by the UN, these Arabs were dispersed quite often by force. Ironically 1948 is the same year that the Universal Declaration of Human Rights declared that everyone has the right to return to his own country. The right of the Palestinians has been ignored or denied. Not even a plebiscite represents their point of view.<br />His argument is compeling. Edward Said writes logically and with insight.

In its early stages, most of the followers of Jesus were Jews who understood that the command of God was to be fruitful and multiply. But in Jesus' own commands to repent and purefy many followers found the \\"primary point of reference\\" to change the Jewish attitude toward sex. Later gnostics and ascetics emphasized that converting meant more than accepting baptism and following a set of moral codes; it meant finding one's spiritual nature. As Christianity changed from a persecuted religion to a state religion, this emphasis increased. By the time of Jerome, Christian writers wrote to Christian women to be better than their sisters by abstaining from sex.<br />Of course, with the fall of the Roman Empire, this was the heritage carried into the Dark Ages. Even though there is no such thing as a Golden Age in early Christianity, the attitude of Christianity toward sex had changed. For comparison one might want to have a look at Catherine Johns' _Sex or Symbol_ or Aline Rouselle's _Porneia_.	2003-07-31

This is not a history of ideas, but a history of politics which is revealed by the discovery of the Nag Hammadi texts. Consider the tenet that Jesus physically rose from the dead. For 2000 years Christianity has asserted this tenet. But, Pagels says, there were early Christians who found this revolting. The political function of the tenet is that &quot;it legitimizes the authority of certain men who claim to exercise exclusive leadership over the churches as successors of the apostle Peter. From the second century, the doctrine served to validate the apostolic succession of bishops&quot; ( page 7).<br />Pagels writes of the political battles in which the &quot;orthodox&quot; position won the day at the same time reminding us that the winners write the history.	2003-07-24

Her thinking here is call into question our ideas of \\"obscene.\\" After 150 pages Ms Johns has not developed her thinking beyond pointing out that sexual images were used in ancient times as symbols of fertility or symbols to ward off evil. It was not her intention to do so. She could have merely pointed out the difference in attitudes toward sex between a person who lived in a city and a person who lived on a farm.<br />Instead it was Ms Johns' intention to provide a pictorial survey of the variety of sexual symbols found in the Greco-Roman world and in this regard she makes her book outstanding. For example, on pages 72 and 73 she shows phallic symbols used as a pendant and as amulets. One amulet shows the combination of three symbols of luck: the phallus, the crescent, and the hand. Page 110 may show a political satire which pokes fun at Cleopatra. And page 82 shows a beautiful silver dish which depicts Pan dancing.

Books	5	5	6	N	N	Too Bad this Book is So Short	Block has come out with his second edition of _Gods of the Nations_ in which he proposes that peoples in the Ancient Near East saw themsleves as members of a national state. Members of a national state were ones who saw themselves as related not just as members of a certain territory but related by other factors as well. Foremost among these latter was kin relationship.<br />Block proposes that there was a relationship between the deities of the ANE, the land, and the people which was similar to a feudal system. The land was given to or reserved by the deity who gave it to the people. Each member of this triad had responsibilities which Block investigates. Thus the conduct of the people was subject to the accounting of the deity.<br />Too bad this book is so short. Block spends too little time addressing the fact that political realities in the ANE shaped theological documents. For example on page 118, Block notes the titular deity of Ur is forced out because Ur has been destroyed.<br />Block could use these political realities to explain the religious syncretism of ancient Israel as known from the archaeological record. Rather than do that, Block concentrates upon biblical texts to explain the rights and demands of the deity upon the people, and then he uses extra-biblical texts to explain the end of the deity-people relationship.<br />A fascinating thesis worthy of a second edition. I will refer to this book often during future reading.	2003-07-09

It is not that these other writings ever formed a canon or were ever a part of a canon with the possible exception of the Book of Jubilees. Rather Barnstone has collected writings which have parallel themes to those found in the Bible. He begins with writings in creation myths and follows it with histories, wisdom literature, gospels, acts, and apocalypses. Sounds like the way the Bible is organized, doesn't it? Barnstone has gathered these writings from diverse sources, from Jewish pseudepigrapha, Gnostic writings, the Dead Sea Scrolls, Christian apocrprypha, and Manichaean sources.<br />Barnstone has selected the best of the best for _The Other Bible_. On page 255 he calls the psalms collected from the DSS the literary jewel of the DSS. In my opinion all of the writings collected by Barnstone are literary jewels. For example, if one wanted to read all of the ancient gospels, one could read Schneemelcher's first volume of _New Testament Apocrypha_.

Twice Over	Madeleine and J Lane Miller have written a valuable resource for the study of everyday life in Bible times. The blurb inside the dust jacket says that there are 74 subjects in 14 sections with 150 illustrations. There are sections on geography, homes, food, clothing, medicine, family events, the life of a nomad, the life of a professional, etc.<br />Let's say one is reading the story of David and Bathsheba. One might turn to the section on military life and read Soldering under David. There one might read that Saul was the first to establish a professional army in Israel rather than depend upon a militia. David added mercenaries to his army. In Israel mercenaries worked for wages but had no rights as a member of an Israelite tribe. A mercenary so totally belonged to the king that when a king died, like a concubine, a mercenary passed on to the king's heir. This raises the question to mind as to whether Uriah the Hittite was a mercenary along with other members of &quot;the Thirty.&quot; One then might decide to read the section on Prostitutes. Prostitution did exist in Israel and there may have been temple prostitutes at Shiloh in the pre-monarchial period. Deuteronmic Law prohibited both male and female prostitution, but prostitution was a fact of life throughout the Ancient Near East.<br />Though the Millers have included a section on the Industrial Life, their book is lacking in discussing the economics of Bible life. There are no chapters on money or taxation. Even so I found this to be a valuable resource. When a favorite sister-in-law admired the book, I gave her my first copy. And then I missed the book so I went out and bought a second copy.	2003-06-15

The archaeological work of de Vaux is well spoken of, but V and F point out his dating may need some adjustment. The site may not have been occupied until the 1st century BCE. There may have been no 30 year gap between Periods I and II. And Yaakov Mosherer (more of his work on coins ought to be read) points out that coins from years four and five of the Revolt are rarer, so there is no need to posit that Qumran was destroyed before 73 BCE.<br /><br />In their survey of the DSS and Scripture, V and F mention that Psalm 145 is an acrostic poem with a verse missing. For those who do not know, an acrostic poem is one in which the successive verses begin with successive letters of the Hebrew alphabet. In the Masoretic Text and English versions based upon it, Psalm 145 skips the \\"nun\\" verse which would occur right after verse 13 in English versions. One of the DSS texts contains the missing verse. The verse from 11QPsA  may be translated \\"God is faithful in his words and gracious in all his deeds.\\"<br /><br />One will want to grab her/his favorite version of the DSS texts as he makes his way through the sections on the non-biblical texts. There is no text of the Book of Esther among the DSS. However there is a *proto-Esther* to be found. The fragments known as 4Q550 clearly show similarities with the Book of Esther though the same story is not told. For all of the scrolls found among the DSS, one might get the impression that the library was comprehensive. Actually it was not. Works such as the Wisdom of Solomon and other Jewish Greek works are absent. Also notably absent is the pro-Hasmonean 1 Maccabees.<br />Most readers will pay avid attention to Part Four of the book on the relationship of the DSS to the New Testament. Dispelled are the theories of O'Callaghan, Allegro, and others. The connections between the DSS and the NT are generally nuanced. 4Q521 supports the idea that Jesus saw himself as Israel's Messiah. However Luke 7.21-22 is not a direct quote of 4Q521. Rather it shows that Jesus adopted an extant manner of speaking and gave it his own spin. Common to nowhere else in ancient writings than in 4QMMT and the Pauline writings is the<br />phrase \\"works of the law.\\" Because of 4QMMT some scholars are rethinking the traditional Protestant thinking of the use of the phrase in Paul.<br />The last section is on controversies surrounding the DSS. The recent availability of the DSS in such books as Abegg's _DSS Bible_ and Garcia Martinez's _DSS Translated_ have made us forget that once upon a time Solomon Zeitlin wrote a series of articles in which he claimed the DSS were medieval documents. More recently was the lawsuit by Qimron against Shanks. This section is followed by four appendices one of which is a bibliography of translations and editions of the DSS.<br />In sum VanderKam and Flint have written a very thorough and very readable survey of the DSS.

For example, the coins minted by Richard the Lionhearted and his brother John all carried the name of their father Henry II because public confidence was based upon an unchanging design. Or for another example, the coins minted by Caesar Augustus phased out the use of divine symbols when depicting the emperor. The political message sent by the coins was that Augustus was &quot;first among equals.&quot; Not surprisingly, Nero reinstated the use of divine symbols on his coins. The political message here is that Nero was &quot;first without equals.&quot; As historical sources coins have a couple of advantages. One is that they were officially produced. And the second is that they were massed produced.<br />_Coins_ is a concise yet very interesting book for readers who want to get beyond coin collecting.	2003-05-30

And we run into the same problem as most travelers in that too soon you have seen too many museums and too many attractions. On the back of his book on Italy Steves says it is his job to &quot;sift through the mountains of time-sapping alternatives and present you with only the only the best,&quot; the creme of the crop. Having just returned from Italy I offer the following example as an assessment of Steves' book.<br />When visiting Pompeii, Steves recommends visiting just ten sites of the some 90 which are listed on the local site map. These include the Forum, the House of Vetti, the Brothel, and the Amphitheater. Since I happen to love ancient history, we saw all of these sites and many more. But to be fair, most folks would prefer to see only the creme of the crop and in my opinion, they would not have thought of my dusty shoes as I did at the end of the day. Steves had picked the creme of the crop.<br />There is one matter that I would like to add to what Steves wrote in his book. Though he mentions that there are pickpockets in Italy, I think he needs to mention how to deal with _most_ of them. Most of these folks are gypsies or panhandlers.

Presented in this book are a series of papers presented to the European Seminar on Methodology in 1998 (Cracow) and 1999 (Helsinki). As Grabbe outs it, the purpose of the papers is to &quot;thrash out questions of historical methodology&quot; and unlike other forums there is a diversity of views. In one way or another all of these essays address Niels Peter Lemche's 1993 essay &quot;The Old Testament -- a Hellenistic Novel?&quot;<br />Hecataeus of Abdera (c. 300 BCE) who knows of an Exodus tradition is cited by several of the scholars. Albertz finds that the Exodus tradition is not as late as the Hellenistic Period. Barstad finds the similarities between Herodotus and the OT(or Hebrew Bible) are too general and that ANE writings are more similar. Becking finds classical Hebrew (1st Temple Period) in the Books of Kings. But Carroll notes that histories are not always written at the same time as the events they describe. Grabbe notes that the Greeks were the first historians who questioned their traditions; the Israelites, with the exception of Josephus and Eupolemus, did not. And Lemche retells his &quot;3 pub&quot; joke of how the Pentateuch was written in 3 pubs in Babylon.<br />Each essay is noteworthy and thoughtful.<br />At the end of the book, Grabbe writes that the topic for the seminar has been too broad and several times the scholars have been able to either talk past each other or ignore questions. Rather than think that this is a deficiency of this book I think it is a strength. This book gives great insights into the still current discussion of the proper methodology to use to study the historicity of the Old Testament.	2003-04-30

May wrote before the time that &quot;self help&quot; became a heading on the shelves of a bookstore, in a time when analytical psychotherapy was still popular. Bearing that in mind, the reader will find that what May had to say then is all too true today. Whereas in the past love and will solved the problems of relationship to others, they have now become the problem. In our schizoid world real communication is rare. (The reader might think that May wrote after the advent of the personal computer.)<br />Now, there are a couple of reasons why I do not offer May's final analysis of the problem. One is that with the advent of &quot;self help&quot; we have shifted from an analytical to a behavioral form of psychotherapy. More than one writer says just do these ten  things and you will be happy. The second reason is that the reader might miss May's concept of the daimonic. In it's simplest terms, it means that a person has to have something going on in his/her life.<br />Read the book. Learn the lesson. Set your own course of actions.	2003-04-28

Shanks writes first about the James ossuary. In the first 80 pages he, tells the story of the find and dispels many of the concerns about the ossuary's authenticity. There was no sign of a modern tool used to make the inscription. The inscription (including the second half) is covered with patina which adheres to the ossuary yet there is no sign of a modern adhesive. Altman's reason for thinking that there were two handwritings may be explained by the softness of the limestone upon which are written the words &quot;brother of Jesus.&quot; Ben Witherington then writes a very interesting account of James, the younger brother of Jesus, his asceticism, and his rise to prominence in the early church.<br />What's the verdict? Being an attorney Shanks says it this way: the evidence can not prove the authenticity beyond a shadow of a doubt, but there is a preponderance of evidence that would win a civil case.	2003-04-19

Books	5	13	13	N	Y	A Roadmap Through the Pesharim	In years past scholars created academic chaos by arguing over the proper way to obtain historical information from the pesharim. For the first two decades of Qumran studies, scholars tended to mine the pesharim for their historical data without regard to the fact that they were biblical commentaries. This was followed by a backlash in which scholars warned against using the pesharim for historical information at all. In more recent years a middle course has been found, a roadmap through the pesharim. And this roadmap now has become the consensus of scholars.<br /><br />Following are some of the conclusions of the consensus. The Righteous Teacher did not found the Qumran sect but became an influential leader. He lived during the second century BCE and died by 103 BCE. He did not write the pesharim himself, but taught \\"fulfillment hermenautics\\" to his disciples. Even so, some of his own writing may be found in the Thanksgiving Hymns. The Qumranites saw themselves as living in biblical history made sacred by earlier acts of God. They saw the Teacher as the one who would enact the final drama of salvation. However the Teacher was not known as a messiah.<br />Charlesworth's monograph is informative and concise but fair. For example, Robert Eisenman's proposal that the Righteous Teacher is James the Just is listed along with over a dozen others. Each proposal is footnoted for the reader who wants to<br />know more.<br />This book is excellent reading on a controversial subject.	2003-04-13

The number of coins is increased in this volume from the 108 which were previously unknown by the time of the publication of the first volume. In addition some of the descriptions have been corrected.<br />The study of coins is a gateway to the history and culture from which they come which in this case is 375 BCE to 332 BCE. For example, most readers will recognize this latter as the time of Alexander the Great. Or consider the rich volume of numismatic material which indicates a thriving economy. Or consider that the head of Melqart/Heracles appears on five of the coins and so is indicative of the Sidonian influence upon Samaria at this time.<br />Though it is a short book, only 128 pages with 31 plates, I find that I thumb its pages again and again looking for one more thing, and I think that anyone else with an interest in ancient coins will do the same.	2003-03-24

One of the aftermaths of the World Trade Center/Pentagon attacks<br />was that there was an increased interest in Islam. People wanted to know what makes those guys tick. _Islam:an Introduction for Christians_ was originally written in Germany in 1990(and translated in 1994) as an ecumenical tool to help Christains understand Islam. Even so _Islam_ is an excellent place to start the study of the world's fastest growing religion.<br />The chapters of the book touch on a variety of subjects. The first seven discuss Islamic faith: the Qur'an and Mohammed, the Five Pillars, law and justice, the family, and death and burial. Paul Martinson then inserted into the English translation a section on Islam in North America. The third part of the book discusses Islamic movements of the present and past and the emphases of these various groups. The fourth part of the book relates Islam and Christianity. How have these two religions acted as they have encountered each other in the past? What about Jerusalem? How is Jesus addressed in the Qur'an? The last part of the book offers a Christian appreciation of Islam.<br />_Islam_ again and again comes back to a simplified answer of what makes those guys tick. On page 101 the story is told of a Ms Lahaj who had been a folk singer in Greenwich Village in the 1970's and who rediscovered Islam. \\"Everything there had been the same for the last 1400 years.\\" The Sharia, the traditional law, as it has been known for centuries has come into conflict with Western values. _Islam_ makes this plain in an anecdote about a chance encounter between a man and the wife of a new Islamic family (page 18), in the chapter on women and the family, in the chapter on marriages between Christians and Muslims, and elsewhere. To this _Islam_ adds (page 133) the note that in the 19th and 20th centuries when Europeon powers practiced colonialization in Islamic countries, the new values introduced by the foreigners presented \\"profound difficulties\\" for Muslims.<br />It is a simplified answer, but that is what makes those guys tick.It is a simplified answer, but that is what makes those guys tick.	2003-03-18

In the story, the prophet Jonah tries to escape the will of Yahweh by boarding a ship at Jaffa which is bound for Tarshish. It is clear from the story that the sailors are non-Israelites; they are most likely Phoenicians.<br />Brody has written a comprehensive anthropological study of the religion of the Phoenicians and those whom he considers their predecessors, the Canaanites. The study is divided into five parts; the patron deities, the sacred shrines, the sacred space aboard a ship (Interestingly, sailors ancient and modern believe that their ship is imbued with a spirit), religious ceremonies of the seafarers, and burial practices of the seafarers (See Ezekiel 27 for mourning of fellow sailors lost at sea).<br />For someone like me who has an interest in sailing and the Ancient Near East, this book was a natural.	2003-03-15

The Gospels are viewed as multi-layered documents like an archaeological mound, and it is the duty of Tradition Criticism to establish the successive layers. The idea is to get down to the \\"textual stratum of Jesus' life\\" (p xvii). For these layers C&R have given the names original, traditional, and evangelical.<br />How does the method work? Since GMatt and GLuke do not share an infancy narrative with GMark and GJohn, what they relate is not original but draws on the traditional. GMatt and GLuke each handle the matter in their own ways and so the evangelical layer of the tradition. Ironically GMatt created the controversy concerning the birth of Jesus found in Celsus et al when the writer of GMatt attempted to create a parallel to Amram, the father of Moses.<br />For me the first was the most interesting chapter. Subsequent chapters attempt to fill out the social world where Jesus lived. Rome like Jeroboam had established a \\"commercial kingdom.\\" Jesus like Amos wanted to establish a \\"covenantal kingdom.\\" Jesus' emphasis upon food rather than land was an economic necessity in the 20's. C&R add a few more chapters on the social world of Jesus.<br />Early in the book C&R write that Jesus acted in opposition to the \\"localization of Rome.\\" C&R claim that this is what caused Jesus to be executed. \\"Pilate got it exactly right, from the point of view to his imperial responsibilities: Jesus and his kingdom were a threat to Roman law and order\\" (p 274).<br />Crossan and Reed have presented their arguments well. A book review is too short of a space to do more than suggest a few items that would lead to another conclusion. C&R describe the Jesus movement as a non-violent movement and say that only its leader was executed. To me this does not make sense. Had the message of Jesus been that volatile in its \\"original\\" stage, it must have been even more so in a \\"traditional\\" stage and even more so in an \\"evangelical \\" stage.<br />First of all, the writings of the New Testament point toward another picture of Jesus and Christianity. John 18.36 has Jesus saying that his kingdom is not of this world. Mark 10.14 and the parallel texts in Matt and Luke have Jesus saying that children are such of the domain of God/heaven. These point toward a Christianity that is other than one identified as political.<br />Second of all, in non-Christian writings, Jesus and Christianity are not identified are political entities with the possible exceptions of a reference in Josephus and one in Pliny. Both of these may be explained as non-political. Rather Jesus is known as a wise man and wonder worker. Early Christians are portrayed as worshipers of a deity.<br />Third of all, the portrayal of the followers of Jesus as a political entity fails to explain how it became otherwise known.

What must travel or life in general have been like in that part of Louisianna a century or so ago.<br />George Washington Cable first collected these seven stories about Louisianna and published them in 1888. He calls them true stories. They are stories from times before his own from 1782 to after the Civil War. At the same time these stories are strange to Cable because life had changed so much in Louisianna between the time that the stories occurred and his own time.<br />The stories start with the story of Louise who came to Louisianna and almost became the dinner of a local chief. This tragic tale is quickly followed by the &quot;bright and happy&quot; story of Francoise and Suzanne who travel through the &quot;wilds&quot; of Atchafalaya. Alix's story is next. She was once introduced to Marie Antoinette. Then the French Revolution came and Alix lost her first husband. She will be a character that I long admire but I ask you to read the story to see why. Salome Muller was a German who lost most of her family enroute to Louisianna. (Some 1200 of the 1800 who attempted to make that trip never arrived.) Salome became a slave. Yet some 20 years or so later her family took her case to the State Supreme Court to free her. The<br />&quot;haunted house&quot; is the house of Madame Lalaurie who chose to save her possessions rather than her slaves when a fire burned her house. The story of Attalie Brouillard reminds me of the con men of the movie &quot;The Sting&quot; with Paul Newman and Robert Redford. The last story is a diary of a Union woman who lived in the South during the Civil War. To these I would like to add the story of George W Cable who begins his book by telling his readers how he got these other seven stories.<br />These are true stories from people who lived in Creole Louisianna, a time strange to us now.	2003-02-24

It is fascinating to think that Old World travelers somehow managed to reach the New World long before the time of Columbus.  Phoenicians came to Vermont where they dedicated a building to the sun god Bel. Druids and Celts also landed in New England. Egyptians visited eastern Canada. In his book, Fell proposes scores of examples of trans-oceanic visitations.<br />Though it does capture the imagination,  I would like to mention that I have done a more thorough study of one of Fell's examples and found that he claims much, but can really prove little. On page 310, Fell writes about the Los Lunas Decalogue. Fell says that the script is like the Moabite Stone which he dates to about 1000 BCE. Patina tests show that the writing is to be dated 500 to 2000 years BP (before the present). Also Fell says that the _punctuation_ matches Greek manuscripts such as Codex Sinaiticus.<br />In response I would first say that the reason that paleography can be used to date a writing is because scripts are used at a particular time in history and then fade out of use. So if Fell finds that the script of the Los Lunas Decalogue is like the Moabite Stone, then he is dating it to sometime around 1000 BCE. Second, I would say that patina tests are notorious for offering older dates than can be verified by other tests. Even so the patina tests on the Los Lunas Decalogue managed to date the writing to only 2000 years BP. Of course this mismatches the paleographical dating by almost a thousand years. Third, I find that the _punctuation_ of the Los Lunas Decalogue includes dots at the ends of sentences which we call periods. Looking at high resolution pictures of the Dead Sea Scrolls shows that at their<br />time Hebrew did not use dots as markers for the end of a sentence.<br />Did Fell reach his conclusions for his scores of other examples based upon such a poor foundation? Though I have not done such indepth research on all of Fell's examples, I would say yes. So although it captures the imagination to think that Old World travelers came to the New World long before the time of Columbus, Leif Ericsson looks like as good as it gets.l of Fell's examples, I would say yes.

The JS is a small self-selected group of scholars unaffiliated with groups such as the Society of Biblical Literature. Though it does contain scholars of note, it does not contain scholars from many major institutions such as Yale, Emory, Duke, or Chicago.<br />Johnson next engages a number of scholars and other writers such as Thiering, Wilson (just a writer), Spong (also not an NT scholar), Borg and Crossan. To put it succinctly, Johnson finds that Jesus has been turned into a &quot;cultural critique&quot; that many think the world needs. For Johnson this is &quot;platitudinous.&quot; Instead Johnson argues that the Gospels can tell us something about the historical Jesus even though they reveal a theological agenda. Further he argues that historical knowledge is normative for Christain faith.<br />(Fast forward toward the end of the book.) From non-canonical sources, Johnson finds covergences of evidence. From Jospehus, Tacitus, the Babylonian Talmud, Lucian of Samasota, Pliny, etc., Johnson finds that Christos was a virtual name of a man who lived in Palestine who was known as a wonder worker and a teacher and who was executed by Pontius Pilate. The followers of this man were known by religious designations and _never_ as a political movement.<br />Other convergences are drawn from the Pauline writings, Hebrews, and the Gospels. Johnson thus concludes that the earliest Christian literature shows a deep consistancy as &quot;Jesus as Messiah.&quot; Though page 166 is not the end of the book, there Johnson raises the pivotal question of whether some of the claims for the pursuit of the hsitorical Jesus are not flights from the NT texts. It is there that Johnson says one can find the real Jesus.e of the claims for the pursuit of the hsitorical Jesus are not flights from the NT texts.

The exceptions are the manuscripts found in Cave 1 which have no number. These appear at the beginning of the book along with other manuscripts which relate to the same text. So for example, the Thanksgiving Scroll appears at the beginning of the book along with 4Q427-432. The Damascus Document also appears at the beginning of this book along with manuscripts Geniza A and B.<br />At the end of the book there is a helpful index of DSS manuscripts and the page(s) on which they may be found. There is also an index of references to other liturature, the Hebrew Bible, the New Testament, and Rabbinic texts. So for example the editors find some connection between 4Q525 and Matthew 5.3-10. Both are beatitudes.<br />It is not a disadvantage of this book that it contains no Hebrew texts. I find that I want to look at photos of the manuscripts and judge the translations for myself. Nor is it a disadvantage of this book that it does not contain any biblical texts. Those may be found in a translated form in Martin Abegg's _Dead Sea Scrolls Bible_.<br />The advantage this book does have is its commentary.

Eisenman and Wise played key roles in those events.Unfortunately _DSS Uncovered_ will be largely remembered for its sensational aspects. Chief among these is the &quot;pierced messiah&quot; text, Eisenman's interpretation of 4Q285. (On this matter Eisenman has since recanted according to none other than Wise who wrote this in _The Dead Sea Scrolls_ on page 292.)<br />This is not to fault the translations. I have no particular problem with the translations offered by E&amp;W. For example, in 4Q521 E&amp;W suggest &quot;resurrect the dead&quot; for VMTIM YCHYH. Perhaps a more literal translation might be &quot;enliven the dead.&quot; However is there that much difference between raising from the dead and enlivening a person? In the thinking of the people of the place and time of the DSS, one raised a person from the dead by enlivening them and enlivening them &quot;raised&quot; them from the realm of the dead.<br />As a digressive thought, I might warn that the reader ought to be aware that fragment and column numbers, and sometimes scroll numbers, change from book to book. There are changes between the two books by Garcia-Martinez on the DSS texts. This is just a hazard of DSS studies.<br />Hopefully the above matters will not overshadow the usefulness of this book. There are transliterations, translations, and most of all...commentaries on 50 different DSS texts. E&amp;W are quite right to point out that their 50 texts compares favorably with the volume of DSS texts which had been published up to that time.

Religion is a set of symbols which act as long-lasting  motivations in people. In narrow contrast, culture is<br />&quot;historically transmitted patterns of meaning.&quot; For Dearman religion is &quot;inseparable&quot; (page 5) from culture.<br />In the first three chapters of his book, Dearman describes the relationship between religion and culture in the Deuteronomistic history, the Chronicler's history, and the Maccabean history. In the last four chapters Dearman addresses four specific phenomena: Covenant instruction, pre-exilic prophecy, wisdom literature, and apocalypticism.<br />Dearman's book is heavily footnoted. One chapter has more than 200 footnotes. the book is well researched. Yet one shortcoming of Dearman's book is that he does not exercise a criticial view of the historicity of the biblical narratives. On page 127 he states that Deuteronomy &quot;is the most comprehensive statement in the Pentateuch of the application to the life of all Israel.&quot; Yet he knows that this writing was written some centuries after the events it intends to record. For this reason I conclude that Dearman never shows that patterns of meaning were historically transmitted.<br />Second Dearman makes short use of extra-biblical sources in explaining the culture of ancient Israel. So what one reads in this book is a record of religion and culture in *biblical* Israel.<br />Finally, I find Dearman's thinking in this book to be shallow.<br />For example, on page 104 Dearman writes that Ezra-Nehemiah represent torah observance as a key to Israel's identity. Some 22 lines later Dearman begins the next paragraph with the same idea and little development of thought in between or afterward.	2003-01-21

In 92 short (5x8) pages, McDermott introduces one to the key sources, the key scholars who are writing about the formation of ancient Israel, and the key arguments written by these scholars.<br />One meets the Amarna letters, the Shashu, the Merneptah Stela, and the Ugaritic texts. One also meets Herzov, Halpern, Ahlstrom, Redford, and others. McDermott puts forward the key arguments of these scholars. For example both Redford and Halpern argue that Israel came into Canaan from outside. Then McDermott points out the shortcomings of these arguments.<br />What are they saying about the formation of Israel? This is it in a nutshell.	2003-01-21

Smith, you probably cannot describe the relationship between Yahweh and these other gods and goddesses. This is what John Day's book is all about.<br />In regards to El, Day finds that Yahhweh and El were originally separate deities. El is portrayed in the Ugaritic texts as benevolent whereas Yahweh is sometimes a warrior, and El is not a storm god whereas Yahweh is. Though they were different, El did have an influence on Yahweh. Yahweh sometimes appears as aged and wise.<br />Of course El is not the only deity considered by Day. Yahweh's relationships to Baal, Asherah, Astarte, and Anat, the Sun, the Moon, and Lucifer, Mot, Resheph, Molech, and the Rephaim are all considered. Day concludes with a chapter on the rise of monotheism.<br /> _Yahweh_ is an erudite book whose author did not write in a short period of time but who spent 25 years collecting sources. As such this book is worthy reading for *anyone* who<br />is interested in the religion of the ANE outside of the Bible.	2003-01-06

In it Barbara Thiering made presentable in a very easy to read fashion her theory that the Teacher of Righteousness (found in the Dead Sea Scrolls) is actually John the Baptist, AND ... the Wicked Priest or the Man of lies is Jesus of Nazareth.<br />Crucial to Thiering's theory is her pesher technique as described in chapter four. Thiering explains that pesher as found in the Old Testament means an &quot;interpretation.&quot; However in the Dead Sea Scrolls, a pesher is a word puzzle set up by the writer so that hidden historical meanings could be conveyed. Thiering goes on to apply this technique to the New Testament.<br />Her theory is generally criticized for one of two things. First, Thiering's pesher technique is backward with regard to the NT. Whereas a pesher is a method for reinterpreting previously written authoritative writings, in Thiering's view the NT was originally written in a codified form. One might note with interest that if this were in fact so, then no one has realized this for about 2000 years. For example, the subapostolic writers totally miss it. The second criticism that scholars generally raise against Thiering's theory is her redating of some of the DSS in order to make them compatible.<br />_Riddle_ was controversial when it was published in the early 1990s. However the theory has gained few adherents and few scholars give it much attention anymore.	2003-01-04

Scanlin begins with a 38 page introduction to the Dead Sea Scrolls which I must admit that I have not done more than skim. (However there is a chart comparing the various approaches to the textual criticism of the Hebrew Bible.) That's because I want to get to the description of the biblical manuscripts. I want to know what the contents of the manuscripts were, when they<br />were dated, and what there significance was.<br />Then I want to get into the third part of Scanlin's book so I can see some of the effects of the DSS on modern translations. For example, in Isa 49.12, the MT says that the people of Sinim will come to Zion. 1QIsaA tells us that the name is Syene which is better known to us today as the site of Aswan (the Aswan dam) or Elephantine in Egypt. Scanlin points out that the NAB, the NIV, and the RSV all follow the DSS reading.<br />One might read Martin Abegg's _DSS Bible_ in order to find the variant readings among the biblical texts found among the DSS. In this book, one gets the chance to see how the DSS have been incorporated into English translations of the Bible.	2002-12-31

This is a subject that is of great interest to me. During the early 1990s, I jettisoned the use of the Documentary Hypothesis altogether. Among other things, it was too subjective. There was no agreement upon the number of sources nor even what constituted a source.<br />Instead I adopted a theory that the Pentateuch was amalgamated during the time of Ezra. The Persians found this advantageous for the political stability of the western portion of their empire, and the Judeans found that a common literature preserved and strengthened their culture. Moreover there was a historical parallel to this in the recording of Sumerian literature in the first quarter of the second millenium.<br />_P and T_ begins with an article by Peter Frei on the definition of Persian imperial authorization. I will inject here that Frei would not accept my historical parallel. The rest of _P and T_ is a series of papers (or verisimilar papers) delivered at the SBL meeting in Nashville in 2000.<br />Joseph Blenkinsopp questions 1) whether the compilation of the Pentateuch during the Persian Period is a case of imperial authorization as defined by Frei, and 2) whether we are speaking of the Pentateuch as a whole or merely the legal content.<br />Liz Fried argues that if Ezra had a genuine commission, that commission would have been to appoint judges who would have judged according to the \\"data\\" (the Persian word for \\"laws\\") of the king.<br />Lester Grabbe follows with an essay which I consider to be a good example of bad writing among academics. In this case the reader is asked to read only 18 pages in order to find out what Grabbe has to say. For some reason academics do not often write by presenting their thesis and then substantiating it. In Grabbe's case one must wait until the end of his essay to hear that 1) he does not think there is any evidence to support religious cults within their empire, 2) he questions the validity of any role by Judah in defending the western border of the empire, 3) he finds the approval of the request of Udjahorresne to be a typical reward for services rendered, 4) the Pentateuch was put into shape during the Persian Period, 5) the tradition of Ezra as a lawgiver founders, and 6) if there was any imperial authorization, it would have been permission to teach the decrees of the king. Grabbe does not write with the idea of assertion followed by evidence. These six conclusions derive from three questions at the beginning of his essay.<br />The above should suffice to introduce the reader to _Persia and Torah_ although there are still three fine essays which I have not addressed including one by Donald Redford. Each of these essays is a worthy read by itself. Together they offer diverse approaches to a captivating idea that is finding more acceptance in the Unites States, i.e. the Pentateuch was formulated during the Persian Period.e does not think there is any evidence to support religious cults within their empire, 2) he questions the validity of any role by Judah in defending the western border of the empire, 3) he finds the approval of the request of Udjahorresne to be a typical reward for services rendered, 4) the Pentateuch was put into shape during the Persian Period, 5) the tradition of Ezra as a lawgiver founders, and 6) if there was any imperial authorization, it would have been permission to teach the decrees of the king.

One would do well to start with copies of the texts. The biblical texts may be found in _The Dead Sea Scrolls Bible_ translated by Martin Abegg et al. The non-biblical texts which includes the sectarian texts, may be found in _The Dead Sea Scrolls_ translated by Michael Wise et al. (Incidentally there are no unpublished texts of any significance. These two volumes cover the field.)<br />Then one needs a book which explains where the Dead Sea Scrolls were found such as Jodi Magness' _The Archaeology of Qumran and the Dead Sea Scolls_. But as the starting point one needs _The Complete World of the Dead Sea Scrolls_.<br />Philip Davies, George Brooke, and Phillip Callaway have written a &quot;complete&quot; introduction to the Dead Sea Scrolls. The first section of the book discusses the discovery of the scrolls, their editing, and their publication. The second section discusses the history of the time of the scrolls, including the sects of that time.<br />Perhaps the third section should have been divided into two. The third section begins with chapters on how to make a scroll, script styles, Carbon-14 dating of the scrolls, and how to reconstruct a scroll from fragments. (If one has never read of the techniques for scroll reconstruction, this chapter is a must.)<br />Next comes the bulk of the book. The most significant scrolls from each cave are discussed. Cave 1 had a number of the sectarian scrolls. Cave 4 had the largest number of scrolls. The scrolls from Caves 5 to 10 receive only two pages of attention despite the sensationalism surrounding the Greek scrolls found in Cave 7 (and see also page 190).<br />The fourth section of the book discusses the settlement of Qumran. (One should be sure to refer to Magness' _Archaeology_.) The fifth section discusses the meaning of the Dead Sea Scrolls. I will leave these for the consideration of the reader.<br />Included in _Complete World_ are a list of the contents of Discoveries in the Judean Desert, a chart of paleographic Hebrew, a list of the scrolls by cave, etc. _Complete World_ is a feast of reading with the scrumptious photographs of a coffee table book. This book deserves more than a five star rating.f Discoveries in the Judean Desert, a chart of paleographic Hebrew, a list of the scrolls by cave, etc. _Complete World_ is a feast of reading with the scrumptious photographs of a coffee table book.

It is a serious study which challenges our modern code of ethics. As Scott defines prostitution, it could refer to either sex but he chooses to write about female prostitution only.<br /><br />Before the end of the first chapter Scott debunks such notions as marriage precluding prostitution and prostitutes being incapable of feeling real love for one man in particular. Next Scott dispatches more misconceptions such as the fundamental cause of prostitution is with the female (it is with the male), and prostitutes were always held in disrepute by their societies.<br /><br />In the second part of his book, Scott devotes chapters to prostitution as it existed in earliest civilizations, prostitution as it was known in the Bible ( a very thought-provoking chapter), and aspects of prostitution in the UK and the US (where in both cases too often prostitution has been a form of life little better than outright slavery).<br /><br />In the third part of his book, Scott writes about the present and future forms of prostitution. He finds an increase in amateur prostitutes who have other means of supporting themselves. He finds that cosmopolitanism often means a preference for prostitutes not of one's own ethnicity. And he finds that the laws of the nations does little to inhibit prostitution nor to protect the prostitute. Yet he concludes that prostitution is declining.<br /><br />The shortcomings of Scott's book are that it was written in the 1930's and that he depends upon too few sources. Westermarck is mentioned often. On the plus side of the ledger is the fact that Scott writes about his topic in such a straightforward way.	2002-11-24

However Thiede's paleographical dating methods are found to be selective; certain letters are compared and certain other letters which would contradict Thiede's theory are not compared.

Prior to Wellhausen the theory of Graf had been all but neglected. It was Wellhausen who persuaded his readers that the Levitical Law was not accepted as authoritative until the time of Ezra. It was Wellhausen who laid out the standard Documentary Hypothesis.<br />Wellhausen's theory has been revised and challanged in numerous ways. Some scholars have tried to establish more than four sources. Some scholars have tried to show that there was a different form of transmission. And some scholars have denied that there were ever sources known as JEDP. Umberto Casuto did so on the basis of challanging the presuppositions of the Doccumentary Hypothesis. R K Harrison did so as a traditionalist/<br />conservative who argued that the Pentateuch was a \\"homogenous composition in five volumes.\\" (See Harrison's OT Intro. which is available from Amazon.) Even W F Albright operated on the assumption that archaeology would act as a control against unnecessary literary speculation. Despite the attacks of the Copenhagen School and scholars such as Van Seters, Wellhausen's version of the Documentary Hypothesis is still alive today.<br />Anyone studying the Hebrew Bible will have to deal with this book.	2002-11-12

When it was published in 1978 it had become a collection of almost 2200 ancient Northwest Semitic seals. Herr organized these seals according to their chronology (from 900 to 500 BCE) and according to their national script tradition as well. Herr includes chapters on Aramaic, Ammonite, Hebrew, Moabite, Edomite, Phoenician, and undistinguishable and forged seals.<br />While I can not say enough about Herr's book, I would like to add a digressive note. Most scholars are familiar with the theory of diffusionism made famous by Barry Fell and others. Fell claimed that many scripts such as the Los Lunas Decalogue were examples of paleo Semitic scripts and so he claimed that Semitic people had come to the Americas even thousands of years ago. Unfortunately Fell must not have had access to Larry Herr's book. Had Fell had access to it, he would have seen that his claimed Semitic scripts did not compare with the scripts found on Northwest Semitic seals.	2002-11-12

One was Walter Eichrodt's _Theology of the Old Testament_ and the other, arguably the superior, was Gerhard von Rad's _Old Testament Theology_.<br />Using a keen sense of form criticism von Rad showed how the Old Testament grew out of the experiences of ancient Israel. Historical event was followed by layering of theological interpretation. These were arranged by ancient Israel in a cultic confession.<br />Von Rad noted that the destruction of the Hexateuchal framework made the discovery of the early history difficult. But the matter was very different if one took into consideration that the sequence of events conformed to a &quot;canonical schema of a cultic nature.&quot;<br />The pre-Mosaic ancestors of ancient Israel were not always worshippers of Yahweh. Genesis mentions cults of the ancestors such as the God of Abraham, the Fear of Isaac, and the Strong one of Jacob. Confessional formulae of which Deuteronomy 25.6 is most important coalesced these diverse traditions into the historiography of the Old Testament.<br />This is the starting point of von Rad's _Old Testament Theology_.<br />This review refers to the 1962 edition of Gerhard von Rad's _Old Testament Theology: the Theology of israel's Historical Traditions_.	2002-09-15

Harrison to be a historian. However that was about 1995 and Harrison's book is from 1969 when the issues of historicity were not the same.<br />Harrison begins his &quot;introduction&quot; (the book runs over 1300 pages) with a review of the development of Old Testament study. A special chapter is dedicated to the Graf-Wellhausen hypothesis and another chapter to reactions to the same. This section is followed by ones on archaeology, chronology, and the text and canon of the Old Testament. Following sections deal with Old Testament history, religion, and<br />theology.<br />After almost 500 pages, Harrison begins to deal with the books of the Old Testament beginning with the Pentateuch. This is followed by sections of the prophets and the writings, the other two sections of the Tanakh. Finally comes a section on the Apocrypha.<br />Needless to say Harrison's Introduction is thorough. His includes some 400 pages more than that of Robert Pfeiffer and 850 pages more than Osterley and Robinson. THIS book is the place to start for anyone interested in what we call Old Testament studies.	2002-09-14

Why yet another review of this book?<br />After 50 plus reviews, why yet another? The answer is that I don't really think that previous reviews have described what _The Bible Unearthed_ is about. There are appraisals and arguments for and against the authors and there are a few reviews which seek to promote someone like David Rohl.<br />Finkelstein and Silberman acknowledge that their book was conceived in the early 1990's when the battle over the historical reliability of the Bible began to attract considerable attention outside scholarly circles. (One may recall the works of Thompson and Van Seters from the 1970's.) What F&S had in mind was a presen-tation of the archaeological and historical evidence for a \\"new understanding\\" of<br />ancient Israel.<br />So F&S find that there were no Patriarchs. There was no Exodus. Jerusalem existed in the 10th century BCE, but it was not the center of a United Monarchy. Israel easily lead Judah until the destruction of Israel by the Assyrians in the 8th cenury BCE. Then Jerusalem had its population swell and Hezekiah sought to throw off the ssyrian yoke. The \\"history\\" of the Hebrew Bible originates from the time of Josiah. Other traditions are gathered. The DtrH needs to be revised due to the death of Josiah.<br />Are F&S fair enough? If one listens to the like of William Dever, one would probably say that F&S are \\"revisionists.\\"  But what do other scholars say?<br />For a long time, the first 11 chapters of Genesis, the Primieval History, have been generally accepted as other than history. John Walton's _Ancient Israelite Literature in Its Cultural Context_ points out that there is no parallel to the family memiors of the Patriarchal Narratives.<br />James Hoffmeier's _Israel in Egypt_ fights a rear guard action for the historicity of the Exodus. It could have happened, but if anything happened, it did not look like what the Bible describes. So where's the history?<br />William Dever himself wrote against the conquest account found in Joshua and Judges. Most of the destruction sites mentioned as they have been identified were not the result of a blitzkrieg or even an extended invasion. Few scholars believe in a conquest of any sorts any more.<br />F&S do not deny the existence of a 10th century Jerusalem. In fact they are willing to accept that the Tel Dan inscription mentions a Judahite leader. But they are not willing to concede that the Golden Age of David/Solomon existed.<br />F&S can point to the topography of the Bible as belonging to the Saite Period and so ask for a later date for the Bible.They can point to Livy's history of early Rome in order to show that history and legend were intermixed in ancient \\"histories.\\"<br />On the other hand, how do they account for the settlement pattern of the four-chambered house in the 10th century? Does this indicate a common culture between Israel and Judah and so a united monarchy at some time? Or how do F&S account for the difference in identity between the various Assyrian inscriptions and the Merneptah Stela?<br />The debate goes on.found in Joshua and Judges.

Like BHS and UBS, variant texts are presented in footnotes along with the references which identify the source of these texts.<br />So for example...in the book's text, Deut 8.12 reads: Otherwise when you have eaten and are full, and have built (fine) house(s) and have lived in them...  In this case the text has been amended based upon integrating material from other scrolls. The reader is directed to 5QDEUTcorr LXX. However a variant reading in 5QDEUT MT SP says that the reading of in them is not found in the MT nor the Samaritan Pentateuch.<br />Perhaps the most significant textual variant is noted on page 224 and 225. 4QSAMa records a variant reading which is recorded no where else but Josephus in which it is explained why Nahash wanted to gouge out the right eye of &quot;every one of you&quot; from Jabesh-gilead. This reading indicates the pluriformity of texts prior to the Common Era.<br />If one is interested in what the Dead Sea Scrolls had to say about the text of the Bible, this book has the answers.

Coeditor Mark Chavalas begins with an essay on the history of Assyriology and biblical studies. The various approaches of scholars has ranged from Malul who took an \\"inventorial\\" approach to comparisons... to G Rawlinson who felt that Assyriology had become \\"uncom-<br />fortably close to the Holy Text\\" (page 27)... to Delitsch who argued that ancient Israelite civilization was in fact derived from Babylonia.<br />Chavalas' essay is followed by two essays on methodology. S Holloway writes of three sometimes overlapping Assyrias: biblical Assyria, classical Assyria, and historical Assyria. Averbeck writes that some of the problems of comparing historiography may be resolved if attention is paid to S Talmon's principle of noting the integral relationship between a text and its society before comparing that text with another text from another society; the two may not have similar uses by their respective societies.<br />Among the following essays, M Chavalas surveys archaeological digs in Syria and some of the results from them. R Veenker provides an overview of the Old Babylonian period and includes Mari, Syria, Hammurabi's Babylon, and the advent of the Kassites. And perhaps the most thought-provoking essay is D Fleming's wherein he finds a *cultural link* between ancient Israel and Emar by comparing biblical religious practice with the zukru ritual of Emar.<br />W Pitard points out some of the similarities and differences between biblical Israel and Ugarit/the Ugarit texts. In particular Pitard argues that the comparisons between concepts of life and death at Ugarit and Israel have been overrated. Pitard points out that one really would not expect a custom to remain the same over a thousand miles or a thousand years ... or even less, of course.<br />W Schniedewind writes that the Arameans were not an ethnic group but a social class from the same geographic region. This he derives from the earliest texts which mention Aram. It is a locale and the people who inhabited it were Arameans. They were diverse peoples from across the Euphrates who had pastoral nomadism as a cultural bond. One is quickly reminded of Deut 26.5.<br />Coeditor L Younger continues his studies of Assyria and the fall of Samaria. This essay includes information on the rations apportioned to Samarian deportees by the Assyrians.<br />Most of the essays in this volume are very informative. The essays are written by leading scholars and usually the topic is one upon which they have spent a great deal of study.

One is to rethink one's characterizations of gnosticism. The second is to replace &quot;gnosticism&quot; as a category altogether.<br />_Rethinking_ divides fairly neatly into three parts. The first two chapters are Williams' critique of gnosticism as a category. The next six chapters discuss gnostic exegesis and the term used to describe gnosticism. herein lies the bulk of Williams' argument. In the last two chapters Williams discusses the history and legacy of gnosticism.<br />One would expect Williams to propose an alternative term to gnosticism and, in fact, he does: biblical demiurgical traditions. What are the advantages of the new term? Williams argues that his term would be specific and easy to distinguish, a modern construct, and not burdened by cliches of the past.<br />In his conclusion, Williams mentions a 1978 paper given by Dr Morton Smith in which the latter argued against the<br />&quot;appropriateness of this category.&quot; At the end of Smith's paper, Williams notes that Smith had resigned himself to the fact that &quot;gnosticism&quot; had become a &quot;brand name with a secure market.&quot;  In response Williams wonders whether the market is not softer than it once was.<br />Perhaps it is and probably it is not. One need only read the titles of new books to see the answer. At the same time there is another matter to be considered: does Williams' argument merit the dismantling of the category? I think not. Gnosticism is not the only term which has floating parameters.<br />For example consider the term &quot;Mesoamerica.&quot; The term was adopted by an anthropologist named Paul Kirchhoff to describe the area between southern Mexico and the central American countries and the peoples who lived there. Although there is interaction between the various peoples who lived in this area, there is also a large amount of differences. The term also sets these peoples in contradistinction to other peoples who shared many cultural similarities but who lived outside the proscribed geographical area.<br />I think one would do well to agree with William that<br />&quot;gnosticism&quot; is a dubious category, but it is far from being the only one.eraction between the various peoples who lived in this area, there is also a large amount of differences.

They begin with a chapter on the paleological eras of Arizona and conclude with a chapter called \\"recent Arizona history,\\" but what that means is that it focuses on events since WW II.<br /><br />There are chapters on the Spanish attempts at settling and controlling Arizona, and there is a very interesting chapter on Arizona's Native Americans. However, my favorite stories are from the many chapters on the time of the Old West.<br /><br />I will wager that most American history books do not include the story that Arizona almost had a seacoast. One legend has it that when engineers were surveying west of Nogales, someone pointed out that the nearest saloon was in Yuma. So the thirsty engineers made a right angle turn.<br />This makes an interesting story, but the truth of the matter was that when James Gadsden arrived in Mexico City in 1853, he had five different offers to make to the Mexican government. The largest was a $50 million offer that would have given Arizona seacoast on the Gulf of California. However the Mexican government declined that offer because they wanted to maintain a land bridge to the Baja Peninsula.<br />Globe, Arizona, was a mining town. The first major mine was developed there in 1873 and the town grew. In time a school was built, but unfortunately no one realized that it was near a bordello. Since the law said that a bordello could not be within 400 feet of a school, some of the citizens of Globe requested that the sheriff shut down the bordello. At the same time, another group of citizens requested that the sheriff move the school. The sheriff measured the distance between the two structures and found that the 400 foot limit extended 4 feet into the front of the bordello. To solve the problem, the sheriff told the madam to conduct her business in the back rooms of the bordello which were just outside the legal limit.<br />In the mining town of Jerome, the miners were paid once a month. For a few days afterward, the mines were closed as the miners spent their hard-earned cash at the local saloons. Some ended up spending a night in jail and some ended up before the local magistrate, a fellow named Lewis St. James who was totally deaf and could not hear any of the testimony. \\"But he seemed to know most of the defendants personally and ruled accordingly. Like most judges, he had an uncanny ability to know just how much money they were carrying and to set the fines accordingly.\\" (p. 145)<br />These delightful stories are among the many in Trimble's cavalcade.

The Bible says that prior to the coming of the Danites, the city was known as Laish, which means &quot;lion.&quot; According to Judges 18 five spies from the Danites saw that the people of Laish lived a quiet and secure life. Perhaps they were traders as they lived after the manner of the Sidonians. They were defenseless against the Danite raiders.<br /> Avraham Biran's _Biblical Dan_ begins with the Neolithic Period. Excavations at what is now known as Tel Dan began in 1966. In 1984, a trench in the southern section of the exca-vation which had been dug to almost 40 feet uncovered a wall and sherds dating from the 5th millennium BCE.<br /> The huge quantity of sherds from the Early Bronze Age (c. 3000 BCE) impressed Biran. Fortifications from this period have not been found, but Biran calls the site a city because the 50 acres would have required urban services and administration.<br /> During the 3rd millennium the first ramparts were built. In the 2nd millennium a technological revolution occurred in pottery making. At the beginning of the millennium much pottery was in vessel form, but by the middle of the millennium a fast wheel resulted in mass production.<br /> Over many seasons the ramparts were excavated. The earth-fill was covered by a layer of plaster some 10 inches thick. The smooth surface and incline made attack difficult. At its base the rampart was about 82 feet in width. However the exact width<br />of the rampart in the lowest strata can only be estimated due to a later stone gate termed Israelite. The city's dense was dependent upon this rampart.<br /> Biran injects comments into his book which remind us of the reality of the region. taking aerial photographs to find the location of a gate, Biran's photographs found modern military installations. Another season later at another site, Biran began to unearth an arch for a gate. Dating some 1500 years before the Romans, Biran had found an arched gateway.<br /> Terraces and houses were built on the ramparts during the Late Bronze Age. The city had expanded beyond the boundaries of its previous settlement.<br /> Biran had hoped to find tangible evidence of the con-quest by the Danites. He found moderate degrees of destruction in several grid squares of Area B. &quot;Perhaps this thin layer of burnt material and ash relates to the mention of the destruction of the city in Judges 18 and in Joshua 19.&quot;<br /> Much of the archaeological work at Tel Dan dates to the time of the Monarchy and runs through the Persian and Hellenistic Periods into the time of the Romans. Biran concludes his book with a postscript of the Aramaic Stele from Tel Dan.<br /> This book is for those of us who enjoy reading about archaeological finds and imagining how the people lived who once produced them.<BR> Terraces and houses were built on the ramparts during the Late Bronze Age.

It has been some ten or twelve years since Dr Paula Fredriksen introduced her earlier book, _From Jesus to Christ_. That earlier book was a \\"discussion of the development of the New Testament's theological images of Jesus.\\" This current book intends to be an attempt to describe the historical Jesus and explain why theological images developed about him.<br /> Fredriksen recognizes that her book is one of many in more than one quest for the historical Jesus. The first quest culminated with Albert Schweitzer's work. The second quest was typified by Rudolf Bultmann. Fredriksen sees herself in the same quest as Crossan, Vermes, Sanders, Wright, etc.<br /> Fredriksen believes that she has found a \\"polestar\\" by which we might guide our way through the myriad writers and their discussions. That polestar may be found in the fact that not only was Jesus executed, but he was crucified.<br /> Since this is not a mystery novel, Fredriksen's conclusion may be revealed. On one hand, Pilate could have easily had Jesus executed at the behest of the chief priests. On the other hand, had Jesus posed any political threat, Pilate would have crucified the followers of Jesus as well. Pilate crucified Jesus because Jesus had a message of the imminent coming of the Kingdom of God which excited the crowds at a Passover celebration in Jerusalem. With the death of Jesus, the excitement of the crowds abated.<br /> If a reader prefers s/he may read just the first and last chapters of Fredriksen's book. Fredriksen includes a chapter on what was most distinctive for a Jew during the time of Jesus. A long chapter follows in which Fredriksen traces trajectories of the meaning of messiahship back through the NT writers to Jesus. And yet another chapter describes the contexts of Galilee and Judea in which Jesus lived and operated. The adage that getting there is half the fun applies to this book.<br /> A brief response to Fredriksen's proposal is in order. That Jesus was executed in order to avoid a massive riot is very plausible except for two things. First of all, it denies the testimony of the NT writers. And second of all, it does not explain the anti-Jewish polemic found in early Christian writings.riot is very plausible except for two things. First of all, it denies the testimony of the NT writers.

Likewise he does not address wildland fires or oil well fires such as the ones which we deal with here in East Texas.<br /> However I appreciate our differences and it here that I learn how to become a better firefighter than I am. When I was first taught scene size-up, I was taught four basic questions: What do I have? What do I need? What do I want? and Who's in command? Norman prefers the acronym COAL WAS WEALTH. (Pardon me if I refer to page 17 of Norman's book at this time.) The last of my four questions should reflect my adherrence to the Incident Command System which is something that Norman's index cites only on page 70.<br /> You never learn it all. Norman includes chapters on ventilation, search and rescue,  forcible entry, firefighter survival, etc. Even though Norman writes for larger metropolitan areas, all firefighters can learn from it. Every page of my copy has something highlighted.	2002-06-01

Mr Kuchinsky believes that a medieval writing known as the Pepyisan Gospel Harmony (hereafter PGH ) is the \\"most ancient Christian gospel of them all.\\"<br /><br />In his book Mr Kuchinsky quickly introduces the results of his investigation of the PGH. Christianity was initially a Jewish-Christain movement until the bar Kokhba war of 135 CE (or AD, if one prefers). At that time he claims that Judaism was \\"outlawed<br />by the Roman state.\\" Then came the \\"Great Gentile Hijacking,\\" a \\"Big Cover-up\\" which Mr Kuchinsky thinks has been success-ful \\"even until now.\\"<br /><br />What is the evidence for these grandiose claims of this author? The evidence could be met on a point by point basis, but for the sake of brevity, I will introduce just one of them, the one which the writer mentions first as evidence of the split between Judaism and Christianity: the observance of the Sabbath.<br /><br />Mr Kuchinsky claims that it is \\"extremely important to know when Christianity first stopped observing the Sabbath.\\" He claims that this should be easy to find in works on early Christian history.<br /><br />This proposition is fraught with logical problems. One of them is that the shift from observance of the seventh day of the week to the observance of the observance of the first day of the week was not a sudden event, but one which varied in practice and in place.<br /><br />Another problem is that the observance of the seventh day of the week as a holy day did not subside with the year 135 CE. During the 4th century, Constantine decreed a limit on certain types of work done on Sunday. However it was not until<br />the 13th century that Gregory IX officially made Sunday a day of rest.<br /><br />Had Mr Kuchinsky read some of the basic reference works such as the ISBE, he would have realized that this proposition is simply wrong.<br /><br />This brings me to another item. Mr Kuchinsky often writes about a vast conspiracy on the part of scholars. His book refers to \\"any standard introduction of early Christian history\\" as being deficient.<br /><br />Actually Mr Kuchinsky has demonstrated an animosity to people who have dedicated their lives to the study of their respective subjects. I viewed a message written on a newsgroup in which Mr Kuchinsky called the academic community<br />\\"lazy, bigoted\\" and always marching in \\"lockstep.\\"<br /><br />So the choice that one has as one reads this book is to decide whether a novice has found something which is radically new and which has been covered up by many people for centuries or whether a novice has concocted a theory in which he is blindly in love.<br /><br />PGH is a medieval gospel harmony and nothing more.onspiracy on the part of scholars.

It is certainly not for someone who wants to know what the title suggests. It is not about what the biblical writers knew and when did they know it. Rather Dever writes *yet again* about what he calls the attack upon the attack upon the &quot;biblical tradition&quot; by &quot;a small but vocal group of scholars&quot; whom he calls Revisionists.<br />Dever mentions several scholars by name as being Revisionists and discusses them at some length in his second chapter. They are Philip Davies, Thomas L Thompson, Keith Whitelam, Niels Peter Lemche, and Israel Finkelstein. I mention them by name because anyone who has read much of William Dever's recent writings might agree with me that he spends too much time writing *against* the Revisionists/ Minimalists/ Copenhagen School and too little time *on the topic* suggested by his titles.<br />In this book, Dever describes the Revisionists as &quot;menacing&quot; because they do not intend to merely rewrite the history of ancient Israel, they intend to abolish it alto-gether. This is an ironic description by Dever as his own point of view is that the history of ancient Israel can begin only with the monarchy. For Dever not all of the Deuteronomistic History is historical. There was no Conquest, for example. So is not Dever himself revising or even abolishing Israel's history?<br />The focal point of this ongoing debate is the historicity of the Davidic monarchy. Dever's opponents say that there is no evidence for the Davidic monarchy. Dever says there is and accuses his opponents of too much skepticism and of not being archaeologists. Yet it is Dever himself who makes explanations for the lack of Assyrian references to Judah. Moreover one of the five mentioned above is an archaeologist.<br />Who would want to read this book? Perhaps only those who have the notion that Dever is arguing for them.	2001-11-02

That hope is that all Christians might answer an emphatic yes to a question posed by Christopher Leighton in the prologue: can we learn to live creatively with  our religious differences? Most of Norman Beck's book is a study of the  beginnings of the problem as found in the New Testament. Then in a final  chapter Dr Beck offers a future agenda for Christianity.	1999-10-09

The subtitle to this volume is: An Introduction to Critical Issues. This would be true is the issues were those of decades past, e.g. the problems of  documentary theory. As it is the issues raised are not the current  ones. One need look no further  than the dirth of footnotes from the  1990's.Or one may note the lack of dialogue with the likes of Lemche,  Thompson, Finkelstein, Edelman, etc. One would do better with Knight's  _Hebrew Bible and its Modern Interpreters_.	1999-09-21

Best does not speculate that the Flood is merely an allusion to one of the many floods of the  Tigris-Euphrates plain. Rather  &quot;Noah&quot; is a king/priest who lived  at the beginning of the third millenium. The Flood is the flood of 2900  BCE.  Best includes chapters on the transmission of the text, the  construction of the Ark, the voyage of the Ark, and what happened to Noah  and his family after the voyage. Most thought-provoking is Best's detailed  explanation of the biblical fi- gures found in Genesis 11.  This book is  fascinating and worth reading by anyone interested in the stories of Noah  and the  Flood.	1999-05-12
