Hunt starts out quite well, but by the end of the first half of the book is looking decidedly shakey. In the second half, Hunt really falls apart and as we get to the last few chapters I'm really embarrassed for Hunt.<br />It's all very well to say, oh wouldn't it be good if White had a worthy opponent to debate on this topic. But sadly Hunt seems to typify those holding to the non-Reformed view-point. So yes, we'd all like to know if there is someone who could put up a better challenge, but maybe it is the nature of the non-Reformed position that there IS no more competant argument to put forward.<br />Anyway, I guess this is the best debate that can be had on this important topic. The authors are often talking at cross purposes, but I guess that is inevitable when one author does exegesis, and the other author presents philosophy and tradition.	2004-03-17

He not only puts forward many of the more radical modernist theories, he basicly puts his stamp of approval on most of them. For example, that Paul didn't write the Pastoral epistles, and many of his other epistles like Colossians, Ephesians and others are also doubtful. That John didn't write all the books in his name. That neither did Peter write 2 Peter, or James write James, perhaps Jude either.<br />Furthermore, that the bible does by no means present a coherent consistant theology. Rather every book has a somewhat different theology that can't be reconciled. Rather we have to prioritise the more important ones. Furthermore, we need to read the gnostic writings to really get as close as possible to what Jesus actually taught.<br />I suppose if you want to know what the modernists are thinking, this gives some insight, but is this the Christian point of view?	2004-02-13

But there are still plenty where the NASB is still superior to the ESV. Either way, Christions should look at either of these two translations I believe.<br />I'll give one example of the NASB's superiority, John 7:31, ESV &quot;When the Christ appears, will he do more signs than this man has done?&quot;, NASB, &quot;When the Christ comes, He will not perform more signs than those which this man has, will He?&quot;.<br />In the ESV, it appears to be an open-ended question. Will he do more signs?? The NASB brings out the truer sense of the Greek construction, that surely he  WON'T perform more signs. I guess this is part of the ESV's greater readability, but for this verse I'll take the NASB's accuracy. However there certainly are passages as well where the ESV wins out, so either of these two excellent translations should be bought and read.	2003-09-19

Even for a long term Reformed Christian it offers depth of insight that you probably havn't come across before. It's not a work of deep exegesis, but it is a work of deep thought. And yet it's also an excellent introduction to Reformed theology. You'll want more than one copy of this one, because you'll be lending it out but not getting it back! The book  is a paradox - essential for the entrenched Calvinist, and yet perfect as an introduction - a must buy!	2003-06-28

Tyndale was the real genius. In fact a well known biblical scholar has said that where the KJV and the Tyndale translation are different it is usually because Tyndale had a better understanding of the original language than the KJV translators had.<br />Personally I've never much cared for the archaic translations. Come to that, most of the genius of Tyndale actually comes from the underlying biblical writers themselves and is readily seen in many modern translations.<br />Too many readers of the KJV actually don't understand what they are reading. For example the &quot;strain at a gnat&quot; verse, which is often labeled a misprint in the KJV, is misinterpreted by most otherwise well informed KJV readers that I've met. (Hint: strain means &quot;filter&quot;).	2003-06-22

No matter what style of NASB bible you want, try and get a paragraph version like the ultra-thin is. It also saves space to make the book thinner. Some other NASB's are verse format with one verse per line, which makes reading it harder, takes up more space per page, puts breaks in the text at unnatural points and encourages taking verses out of context. .... This version includes a ribbon book marker. (Pity it doesn't have two ribbon markers like the Cambridge KJV though).

Is the NASB95 - the king of the literal bible translations dead? That must surely be the question on our minds. The answer is, \\"I'm not sure, but it's having a good run at it!\\".<br />Firstly my comparison - I compared 50 difficult verses. The NASB95 and ESV were way way out in front of all other versions in accuracy. I gave the NASB95 a couple of extra marks over the ESV, but there's not a lot in it.<br />Secondly, literalness. On a word for word basis the ESV actually seems a little more literal than the NASB95 in that it is much more thorough in translating all the little words, the \\"ands\\" and \\"buts\\" and so on, as well as allowing sentences to run on where they do in the original. On the other hand, the fact that it is a warmed over RSV shows through in a lot of verses that should ideally be re-worked in NASB style. However, the ESV sometimes seems to try harder in consistantly rendering the same Greek word as the same word in English - but not always, sometimes the NASB is more consistent. Conclusion - The ESV is more literal on the \\"forest scale\\", but the NASB is more literal in the \\"tree scale\\".<br />However, the NASB appears to be quite a bit more accurate with tenses. Sometimes these verses have important theological significance. e.g. Acts 13:48 NASB \\"had been appointed\\", and Mt 18:18 NASB \\"shall have been bound\\" are more accurate than the ESV equivilents which are carry overs from the RSV (and KJV).<br />Thirdly, readability. People are talking about the ESV being more readable than the NASB. I don't think there's a lot in it. The ESV has it's fair share of bloopers where the English is strained and the NASB is readable. Sometimes the NASB's lessor readability increases its literalness and correctness. Conclusion: I personally can't see the difference. If we could pick some verses from the ESV and some from the NASB we would probably approach perfection!<br />Fourthly, scholarship. The ESV has taken advantage of the latest scholarship, especially in Greek and this shines through in a number of difficult passages. The NASB95 seems overly conservative in this respect.<br />Fifthly, textually. The ESV seems to have greater respect for the standard Greek text - the UBS4. The NASB seems more conservative in following traditional readings. (Not just the bracketed passages, but of course including them). However, neither strictly adhere to UBS4, even ignoring verses bracketed in the UBS4 or NASB. Conclusion: A minor plus for the ESV.<br />Sixthly, extra features. The ESV footnotes seem more helpful than the NASB95. On the other hand the NASB's use of italics for words not in the original language and the \\"*\\" tense asterisk to show words that were present tense in the original, emparts more information than the ESV. On the other hand, the ESV's extra literalness seems to have a little less need for the italics in places. The NASB capitalizes pronouns that refer to Christ or God. While one might regard these as an unnecessary interpretive gloss, they do improve comprehension, especially since a literal translation does not allow doing what the NIV would do, which is replace \\"He\\" with \\"Jesus\\" to clarify who is talking in long narratives. I didn't like this at first, but now I do, it's just another little feature that the NASB has to add information to the text without actually departing from literalness. Conclusion: NASB's extra features probably empart more information. The use of CAPS for Old Testament quotations is helpful in the NASB, and I like the italics and \\"*\\" tense indicator.<br />Formats: Some people are complaining that the NASB is printed verse by verse rather than paragraph style. Actually, only some NASBs are printed that way. If you don't like it (and I don't), buy the versions that are printed paragraph style. Visit Lockman's web site if you are unclear on that. As of now, the NASB is available in pocket formats and study bibles. The ESV is planned to offer these, but not as yet.<br />Overall Conclusion: It's very difficult to make up ones mind which is best. The arguments seem so finely balanced in either direction. The ESV is a fine effort and one of the best two translations available. At the end of the day, I think I'm going to give the win to the NASB. The extra features of the NASB95 text - CAPS for quotes and italics, plus a slight advantage in literalness and accuracy just beats the ESV to victory.

People are talking about the ESV being more readable than the NASB. I don't think there's a lot in it. The ESV has it's fair share of bloopers where the English is strained and the NASB is readable. Sometimes the NASB's lessor readability increases its literalness and correctness. Conclusion: I personally can't see the difference. If we could pick some verses from the ESV and some from the NASB we would probably approach perfection!<br />Fourthly, scholarship. The ESV has taken advantage of the latest scholarship, especially in Greekand this shines through in a number of difficult passages. The NASB95 seems overly conservative in this respect.<br />Fifthly, textually. The ESV seems to have greater respect for the standard Greek text - the UBS4. However, neither strictly adhere to UBS4. The ESV is more faithful to UBS4, from my count 16:31 or 16:40 if you count the bracketed [] verses in the NASB. Conclusion: A plus for the ESV.<br />Sixthly, extra features. The ESV footnotes seem more helpful than the NASB95. The NASB is particularly poor at footnoting textual issues. On the other hand the NASB's use of italics for words not in the original language and the \\"*\\" tense asterisk to show words that were present tense in the original, emparts more information than the ESV. On the other hand, the ESV's extra literalness seems to have a little less need for the italics in places. The NASB capitalizes pronouns that refer to Christ or God. While one might regard these as an unnecessary interpretive gloss, they do improve comprehension, especially since a literal translation does not allow doing what the NIV would do, which is replace \\"He\\" with \\"Jesus\\" to clarify who is talking in long narratives. I didn't like this at first, but now I do, it's just another little feature that the NASB has to add information to the text without actually departing from literalness. Conclusion: NASB's extra features probably empart more information. The use of CAPS for Old Testament quotations is helpful in the NASB, and I like the italics and \\"*\\" tense indicator.<br />Formats: Some people are complaining that the NASB is printed verse by verse rather than paragraph style. Actually, only some NASBs are printed that way. If you don't like it (and I don't), buy the versions that are printed paragraph style. Visit Lockman's web site if you are unclear on that. As of now, the NASB is available in pocket formats and study bibles. The ESV is planned to offer these, but not as yet.<br />Overall Conclusion: It's very difficult tomake up ones mind which is best. The arguments seem so finely balanced in either direction. The ESV is a fine effort and one of the best two translations available. I think, at least for the moment I'm going to go with the NASB. The extra features of the NASB95 text - CAPS for quotes and italics, plus a slight advantage in literalness and accuracy just beats the ESV - maybe. I can't rule out that I may change my mind later on. Reports of the King's death have been exagerated, but I just wish there was a translation that picked the best out of the NASB and ESV.	2003-03-18

Instead it is a set of experiences related to his life as a scholar, which is very interesting reading in its own right and I recommend the book on that basis, but don't expect much insight into Metzger's inner self, apparently he can't even ditch his scholars cap when talking about himself!	2003-03-18

He does not for example believe that 2 Peter is written by Peter, nor that the pastoral epistles are written by Paul. This is the kind of unbelief that undergirds all the arguments set forth.<br />And make no mistake, the whole book is an argument in favour of the author's theory. His theory is not so much that there is an open canon, but rather there isn't really a canon at all, books can go in and out of the &quot;canon&quot; as per the community's practices. It's all very wishy-washy thinking.<br />That's not to say that there is no truth in his viewpoint, nor is it to say that there is not quite a bit of interesting information in the book, but every piece of information is moulded and shaped to fit the author's theory, it is by no means an unbiased approach to the topic. And frankly, the author's unbelief show's through in the conclusions he draws from every piece of evidence. The book is more worthy of an athiest than a Christian. As one reads the book, it seems like the most bold and interesting of his claims are the least well supported. There is a lot of general information that makes it seem like he knows what he is talking about in a scholarly way, but then he slips in these fairly unsupported claims that pretend to rest on the rest of the scaffolding. And when the historical record is silent or incomplete, it really shows through the author's unbelief in what he reads into that silence.<br />All in all, this is not a book that I can commend to the church.	2003-03-18

This is much more information that most Christians want or need in choosing a version, and much too little information if you really want to get involved in this topic of manuscripts(See Bruce Metzger or Kurt Aland). The analysis of the first chapter of John in a few versions is good, but should have been taken much further to other difficult passages. At the end of the day, a Christian who wants to investigate the versions will have to buy a Greek interlinear and several versions and analyse some passages themselves. The main worth of this book is if you really do want a gentle readable introduction to the existing old manuscripts. For someone already  fairly knowledgable about the versions, the book is fairly basic, though still there are not a few nuggets of information not to be found elsewhere, plus some summaries of information otherwise hard to gather together. Comfort pushes his own views on various topics, including overly strong support for gender-neutral language. Still, another thoughtful perspective on the versions is always interesting. The other book about versions is Metzger's &quot;The Bible in Translation&quot;. Metzger spends most of his book discussing the actual versions themselves, with the keen scholarly eye that he is known for.	2003-03-10

The book is not quite as interesting a read as Metzger's book which is more readable. However this book benefits in a much higher level of detail regarding certain aspects of the mss, as well as giving a very detailed introduction to the use of the aparatus of the NA26 and UBS3 Greek New Testaments, which is no doubt essential for someone who desires to understand these in every detail. It also deals in much more detail with other modern editions of the Greek New Testament, their pros and cons.<br />In response to the other commentators and the Alexandrian texts. It is not really in the scope of this book or Metzger's to really prove their opinions of various manuscripts and their individual value. That really becomes clear when the entire New Testament tradition is studied as a whole and entails considerable work. Those criticizing Aland and Metzger et. al. in my experience do so from a position of ignorance as armchair critics.	2002-12-31

Even if you don't really understand Greek and are just curious about the variant readings and which one was chosen and why, even the layman can pretty much understand what's going on. You can virtually read this book stand-alone, with only an English bible as a companion, but you will need a Greek Lexicon to understand every argument made. The serious student will of course read it in conjunction with a Greek New Testament. The size of the book is almost exactly the same as \\"Novum Testamentum Graece\\" (aka NA27) (The Greek New Testament) by Nestle Aland, with similar but not identical binding. You should ideally own NA27 if you want to have full information about external evidence. The UBS version \\"The Greek New Testament\\", is not adequate in this respect.<br />Regarding Gary F. Zeolla's strong advocacy of the Majority Text: I have to violently disagree. Space does not permit to elaborate, but suffice to say that the primary theory of the MT researchers is NOT a majority reading, but an analysis of the origins and transmission of various mss. In the places where the MT researchers have had time to actually do this research (John 8, and Revelation), in a quite large percentage it is NOT the majority reading. So much for the Majority text, and so much for the Majority Text theory of transmission. That's why I believe Metzger's work in this book is the correct approach.<br /> [...]	2002-12-19

But this book, Comfort/Brown/Douglas has its own benefits. It's much more compact (if you get the Personal Size Edition), it's more readable (because it uses an appropriate word for the situation, rather than just using the same word-for-word), and also it has a few other minor features - textual variants, and a few other minor features for understanding the fine details of the text. For this reason I would recommend this book over the McReynolds for more &quot;casual&quot; reading (if there is any such thing as casually reading ancient Greek). On the other hand, the fact that McReynolds always translates the same word the same way makes it less biased, and in my opinion better for making your OWN translation from the text without external interferance.<br />The printing quality in my edition was a bit variable - some pages darker than others, but no big deal.	2002-12-19

This is the most unbelievably useful study tool I've ever come across, and without any doubt, by far the best interlinear ever made.<br />The text is United Bible Societies 3rd Edition (which BTW, is exactly the same to the word as the latest 4th Edition). NRSV is in the margin. (BTW, the NRSV is an ok translation, it matches the UBS4 text quite well, even though I prefer either NASB95 or ESV).<br />Strongs numbers are above the word and a complete concordance in the back based on Strongs number.<br />Each word is always translated the same way in the interlinear no matter how appropriate that may or may not be. This is good and bad of course. In my opinion it is good because it highlights when the same word is being used in different contexts and is very useful for making an unbiased translation of your own.<br />It is a big bulky book. If you need something compact go with the Personal Size Edition of the Brown/Comfort/Douglas Greek/English interlinear. It's no where near as good without Strongs and concordance but it is very compact.	2002-12-19
