Michael York's book attempts to resurrect a category of cross-cultural religious understanding once thought to be irredeemably imperialist, archaic or Eurocentric. In examining Paganism, he is not concentrating on contemporary forms referred to as Neo-Paganism, but rather drawing thematic continuities to forms of worship across times and spaces. From Greco-Roman times onwards, York sees Pagan gods as essentially having an kindred affinity with Humans--different in degree rather than in kind. Fundamental \\"animism, polytheism, idolatry, corpospirituality, local emphasis,\\" geosacrality, apotheosis, devotional reciprocity, regeneration, circular history, vitalism, phallicism, and most of all, celebration---these are the salient forms York finds in Paganism as a root religious type. Earth and Nature are the sacred texts for Pagan religions. <br /> <br />There is typically an \\"otherworld,\\" but not a transcendent one. Rather, for York, Otherworlds in Paganism are earthly paradises, or at least realms that intersect with with this world and immanent, sometimes co-terminous, even \\"co-dependent\\" with this realm. Again, often a difference of degree, rather than kind. The flexibility and innovations of dioscuric triads and Shaman-Tricksters are common as well, and York connects this theme again across spaces, from the Norse trickster Loki to Hermetic Sacred Magic in the Western Tradition. Behaviorally, York draws on Peter Berger to claim that natural, spontaneous worship directed in this world is characteristic of Paganism, as well as the idolatrous bhakti devotions of vernacular Hinduism. Even Thai Theravada Buddhism is examined for its devotion to relics, veneration of images, and tradition of geolocal domestic spirit houses. <br /> <br />A number of different religious expressions are examined for these forms of devotion. Chinese folk religion (including but not limited to ritual Taoism), Japanese forms of Shinto, and vernacular (but not speculative or Brahmanical) Hinduism.Afro-Carribean and contemporary Western Paganisms are also examined as part of these ways of approaching sacrality. <br /> <br />This not to say that all Paganisms are the same. York makes sub-typological distinctions, such as geopaganism, recopaganism, and neopaganism. York actually places Neopaganism on the fringes of the typology, due to its alleged lack of actual polytheism. And he is careful to include significant doses of humanism, from Epicurus to Confucian ideology, that accompany different forms of Paganism. York also does not shy away from the \\"darker\\" aspects of Paganism. For if Paganism works by enhancing/restoring environmental equilibrium, sometimes both offensive and defensive modes are needed. Contrary to what some would argue, this makes Paganism more of an ethical religious stance for York than the transcendental or gnostic religious modes, as he later points out. <br /> <br />The first part of the book is largely devoted to fleshing out the typology, while the second section covers examples from these many cross-cultural traditions that exemplify parts of the typology. Thirdly Paganism is contrasted to what he calls 'gnostic' modes of religiosity or 'transcendental' modes, although all of these are found as modes within individual large religious traditions. Yet York sees 'world-denying' religions such as Christianity, Zororastrianism, and speculative Buddhism as more properly transcendental or gnostic religions. Some of these non-Pagan modes are found within the heritage of Western occultism. For example, York considers Platonism, Theosophy and New-Age more gnostically oriented than Pagan. <br /> <br />Its a bold book, and one that has merits. Some volumes work by claiming large amounts of ground, which is then refined and modified/challenged over time. This may be one of those volumes. There are some vocabulary archaisms, such as the terms \\"primitive,\\" \\"cult\\" and \\"Lamaism,\\" which communicate some of the unease associated with what some may seeas imperialist throwback. I think there is significant merit in York's argument, although I see concerns as well. But York is to be commended for his boldness in articulating a major field of study. In closing, it is perhaps important that York himself closes with a mention of Pagan ethics, naming \\"honor,\\" \\"trust,\\" and \\"friendship\\" as an ethical triad. Paganism, after all, since it is at heart concerned with relationality and relationships, is an ethical religious stance before it is anything else.	2005-03-23

Robert Wallis's recent book on neo-Shamanism is, like his colleague Jenny Blain's work, highly informed by detailed and presented theory. Wallis's approach is that he is writing an autoarchaeology of neoShamanism--one informed by neoShamanism itself, but also drawing upon narratives of a usable past created by neoShamans, critiques and views of neo-Shamanism from the perspective of indigenous peoples, and also of his own experience as a neo-Shamanic practitioner. Wallis is not acknowledging his own experience as definitive--this is not an autobiography. Rather, he writes knowing that archaeologies, whether geological or ideological, are always politically informed from a situated position of knowledge--not some universal view from nowhere. Drawing on Queer Theory, Post/Neo-Colonialism, he echoes Anthony Giddens in suggesting that \\"in a reflexive world, we are all knowledge producers.\\" Ultimately, Wallis, a practitioner himself, gives qualified support to neo-Shamanic efforts, while acknowledging the legitimacy of much (but not all) indigenous criticism. <br /> <br />Wallis is forceful in articulating the influence of shamanism on Western modernism, in art, literature, and occultism. But he asserts head-on that not all neo-Shamans are neocolonialist--and the attempts to authenticate indigenous Shamans as real and neo-Shamans as not again reduces indigenous Others to exotic \\"noble savages.\\" Furthermore, this simple 'positivist' dichotomy of authentic/inauthentic is largely a mask for larger questions of legitimate/illegitimate knowledge based on the situatedness of power. Mircea Eliade, Carlos Casteneda, and Michael Harner are discussed as markers of \\"white Shamanism.\\" But Wallis does not limit himself to texts. Rather, he considers aspects of material archaeology, art, and artifact in his investigation--a welcome addition to a discipline too often mired in either texts or experiences. <br /> <br />Wallis has criticism for some neo-Shamans, but he extends those to theacademic concept of \\"core shamanism\\" as well. He doesn't mind the capitalism of neo-Shamanic training, since shamans have often received payment for services, but does see individualizing, romanticizing, reification of the primitive, and acceptance of prior gender and social roles as a major theme distinguishing Shamanism from neo-Shamanism. Yet, he also sees neo-Shamanism as returning benefits to indigenous communities as well, raising awareness, and undergoing phenomenologically similar experiences. Likewise, he sees neo-Shamans as engaging with similar morally ambivalent or harmful powers that Shamans also engage with. And neo-Shamanism has, through its association with contemporary Pagans, given Shamans and Shamanism a wider field in which to operate and articulate their own claims. In addition, Wallis finds that neo-Shamanic investigations of ancient \\"Celtic\\" and \\"Northern\\" shamanism, while problematic, have positive aspects to offer. Academics, he contends, have ignored these subjects almost entirely, as well as neo-Shamanic contributions to research in this area. <br /> <br />Wallis's most powerful contributions come in his discussion of contemporary Wiccan, Druidry, and Heathen seidr neo-Shamanism. This is part of the larger platform Wallis claims in his previous discussions, and he demonstrates that there are thematic similarities of process in each of the traditions he discusses, at least with the concept of core Shamanism as it has been elaborated in academic discussion. At the same time, he reproduces information and dialogue that shows Pagans are not engaging wholesale in uninformed cultural theft, but instead often consciously looking for thematic kinship in the way they approach Power, Place, and Persons, both human and other-than-human. Wallis's ethnographic fragments of Diana Paxson's Hrafnar community and Greywolf Shallcrass represent gold-mines of previously under-explored aspects of contemporary Paganism, and raise Michael York-style questions of thematic and typological similarity to other religions such as as Umbanda. <br /> <br />In the end, Wallis chides academics for neither investigating Pagan shamanisms, whether ancient or (post)modern systematically, and in failing to engage the subject adequately, can hardly take neo-Shamans to task for at least investigating these subjects. In addition, his coverage of archaeologists and contemporary Druids using Stonehenge and Pagans at Avebury is unparalleled. A companion chapter covers controversy over Amerindian concerns at Chaco Canyon and Mesa Verde. <br /> <br />Wallis contends that while criticisms of neo-Shamans is in some cases justified, over-generalizations and misunderstandings of neo-Shamanism are also common, and the extreme amounts of diversity in these movements means that they cannot be fairly painted with such a broad political stroke. In addition, he contends that the entire framework of discussion is often flawed, being based out of terms (like Amerindian blood purity) created by colonialist governments. His implication is that those situations which exhibit the highest tension are best approached by initiating a broad process of historical accountability and reconciliation in general between Amerindian peoples and the U.S. government. <br /> <br />An recommended volume that appropriately frames the many complex discussions at hand.	2005-03-23

In this volume, she defines and defends what she calls \\"Nature Religion.\\" <br /> <br />And its an impressive set of drawn-out sketches and themes-- admittedly just one of many possible ways to map this space. Algonkian Amerindian religion is impressively overviewed, and the role of \\"Nature\\" here (a European concept) is dissolved into a complex interlocking set of relationships between Powers, Places, and Persons, both Human and Other-Than-Human. For the Puritans, Nature was abstracted into all that was \\"Other,\\" usually a place of wilderness and evil--a Place to be feared. Although, as Albanese points out, precedents exist in Christian history for the wilderness as a place of testing and purification. The new republicanism from the conservative American \\"revolution\\" fostered a \\"wilderness eucharist\\" mentality--holding Nature sacred as something to be ingested, thereby becomed (and overcomed).  <br /> <br />Yet other turns no less revelant today are covered. Transcendentalism and its associated 'heathen' ambiguous reverance for Nature are documented, both in the paradoxical sense of Nature as the Ultimate and Nature as a illusion (or correspondence for the Ultimate. Both of these senses are inherited in contemporary Goddess worship and the different, but related phenomenon of New Age religion, while each of them individually leads Albanese to wilderness preservation ideology and Christian Science/Mind cure movements. <br /> <br />For Albanese, this protean concept contains its own multivalency, its own pluralism, and therefore tends to recede in influence and importance the more a particular offshoot institutionalizes and fossilizes. It is a voice more suited to a prophetic mindset than a priestly mindset, although that too could be possible, it seems. Excellent and challenging work to uncover and begin to document this counter-covenantal thread throughout American history and religion. Albanese freely admits to inventing the term herself--but she is correct in that using it as a frame of reference, for both elite and popular culture, for both empirical and cultural facts, tells us something very important about religion in the United States.	2005-03-23
US	52382660	R1SDWNPAOUZ5FZ	0812218795	282928064	Witching Culture: Folklore and Neo-Paganism in America (Contemporary Ethnography)	Books	5	30	32	N	N	Improves on Hutton and Pike. Well written and recommended.	Sabina Magliocco's \\"Witching Culture\\" is quite possibly the most significant volume on Contemporary Pagan Culture to have been written in several years. Magliocco, author of an earlier volume on Neo-Pagan Art and Altars, has filled in several gaps left by Ronald Hutton and Sarah Pike, authors of important recent works in their own right. <br /> <br />The real strength of Magliocco's approach lies in her combined historical and folkloric approaches to cultural formation. Nods to other theoretical approaches are made, especially in her discussion of Paganism as a culturally oppositional discourse (James Scott, Todorov, Gramsci) but for the most part her own theoretical approaches are interwoven with her content so as to produce a seamless integration. <br /> <br />As I noted, her attention to the categories of the Other, both as conceived from Christian heritage and the Enlightenment's 'God of Reason,' are set up as the early framework of the book, along with valuable summations of early Hermeticism, medieval ritual magic, Renaissance Humanism, and 19th C. Romanticism to show the contributions of each era to contemporary Paganism. In this she avoids Hutton's obsession with the British 19th century and yet misses much of Hutton's focus on cunning-folk and those more vernacular traditions. Magliocco's work is more concerned with those who wrote on those traditions, and how those writings (Leland, Murray, Gardner) were used as a crucible to create contemporary Paganism. <br /> <br />Excellent portions of the book also focus on energy, magic, naming and ritual, as well as the historical and folkloric contributions to the formations of these much-used categories by contemporary Pagans. In addition, this is the first volume I am aware of to treat music and song in such depth. Two main aspects of song are treated--ritual uses (echoing her earlier scholarly articles on the subject with Holly Tannen) and educational uses--that is, teaching modes of thought and interpretation common to Pagans. While these are not the only important functions of Pagan song, these are the most important aspects for her work, for she concentrates on community identity and maintenance. Partly because of her concern with boundary formation and maintenance, her work engages little with New Age religiosity, and instead concentrates on flash points such as cultural appropriation issues with indigenous peoples, especially Amerindians. Again, given the existing literature, this is a plus, rather than a minus. <br /> <br />If there are drawbacks to her work, they are similar to other important works in the field. Most of the book concentrates on Wicca, witchcraft, Feri, Reclaiming and New Reformed Orthodox Order of the Golden Dawn (NROOGD), all closely connected with dominant structures in the Eastern part of the U.S. Other facets of contemporary Paganism, such as Druidry, Pagan Vodoun, Church of All Worlds, and Asatru/Vanatru, draw significantly less attention. But as these are numerically proportionately less of the wider community, their comparative marginalization is understandable in a study like this.	2005-03-23

Eller distributed a questionnaire, available in the appendix, and interviewed a number of both well-known and (for a lack of a better term) entry-level participants in the feminist spirituality movement. <br /> <br />The early chapters are devoted to discussing the different ways women came to the movement in their own voices, whether through gradualism, serendipity, or acute crisis. Contemporary Paganism's role in feminist spirituality is given its own chapter, as are the ethics of affinities and appropriations across racial, religious, and cultural lines, and a general sociological makeup of the movement at that time. Eller reinforces the notion that ritual, rather than belief, tends to hold feminist spirituality together, specifically collective ritual that has a very Wiccan structure to it, although other forms, such as talking circles and guided meditations are covered as well. Some attention is given to solitary work, magic, and thealogy. Thealogical emphases are immanence, pantheism, functional polytheism and parthenogenic cosmogony. <br /> <br />As in her discussion of ethics, the ethical dimensions of magic and hexing are emphasized. Eller refers to language used by practiioners, but sometimes fails to define it. For example, one name used for those willing to use magic to both hurt and heal are referred to as \\"Aradians,\\" without reference to Charles Leland's \\"Aradia: Or The Gospel of the Witches,\\" a 19th century document that chronicles the divine power of witches to cause harm to oppressors by magical means. <br /> <br />Much of the focus of the movement is somatic, including what some might see as a pre-occupation with bodies. But for Eller's participants this too is a matter of coming home, of attempting to re-member themselves first to their immanent experience of living as a healthy, rather than an estranged, connection. And the first step to this, at this time, was articulating a gynocentral myth of ancient matriarchy or \\"partnership\\" societies, which Eller summarizes in one chapter. She would later spend an entire volume critiquing this myth. <br /> <br />Perhaps related to this is her presentation of the debate between those feminists who find ecofeminist political power in feminist spirituality, and those who find it yet another form of distraction from the material reality of women's lives--yet another form of anodyne escapism. Yet Eller implicitly takes sides in this debate by finishing her volume and revisiting the subject of why feminist spirituality is here and what roles it fulfills, in a more concrete sense of her own conclusions, rather than the voices of the women who were first introduced in the beginning of the book. <br /> <br />The volume is a necessary addition to all who are researching feminist spirituality in the United States of any stripe, and presents much of its information in form of interviews and information from a wide variety of women's experiences, invaluable for subsequent researchers. Eller is also to be commended for her attention to popular art forms such as music, ritual, and altar construction as part of her study. <br />	2005-03-18

While her book \\"Voices From The Pagan Census\\" is designed to display mostly raw survey data with little interpretation, this work handles most of her interpretive analysis of this movement. A note of warning--although the title includes \\"Neo-Paganism,\\" there is very little here not of Witchen or Wiccan tradtion. Those looking for cross-tradition discussion will be disappointed. <br /> <br />Her book, thankfully, is centered around questions of family and tradition continuity through children, and how the influence of multi-generational change will affect the communities at hand. Her own major influence is Anthony Giddens, who holds that \\"postmodern fracturing\\" is the logical outgrowth of modernity, rather than a new era. Likewise, the subject or self has in no way evaporated, but rather remains symbolically negotiated and mediated between public and private experiences. As globalization lifts and floats institutions above their historically grounded practices and origins, so Wicca, as a religion of its time, asserts a similar possible universality, and this accounts for the way it draws both on individual experience and large, competing traditions of formerly indigenous knowledge as valid ways of practice. <br /> <br />Offering a background in census numbers, the concept of magic, Gerald Gardner, and other common Witchcraft parameters, Berger first focuses on the concept of the \\"magical self,\\" a Promethean space attuned to the mysticism both of specific theurgical rituals and the mysticism of everyday life. Gods/Goddesses are viewed multivalently, and personal transformations, (often in terms of gender roles and expectations) are a predominant concern in ritual. <br /> <br />Berger then moves outward, to examine \\"The Coven,\\" and the space of (post)modern friendships and fluid relations that develop. Secrecy, the Learning of Witch practices, and the similarity to family and kinship structures is discussed. Again moving outward, Berger examines covens and groups in relations to the larger concept of community. Drawing on Shane Phelan's concepts of lesbian community, Berger argues a similar process takes place--insulation from hostility, visibility, persona construction, and political launching pad for interacting with the wider world. While large conflicts exist, Berger posits the commonality of a magical \\"shared life world\\" and a collective memory that helps to construct a usable past and promising future, one that is envisioned especially at festivals. <br /> <br />Perhaps most fascinating and unique is Berger's attention to children and the routininzation that accompanies multigenerational development. While some families affiliate themselves with institutions such as Unitarian Universalism for social cover, others question bringing in children at all. As most parents were raised a different religion, many do not want to inflict that same conflict on their children. Another conflict is involving children in rituals normally meant for adults, with archaic language and intense group concentration. Other families and groups write rituals in which children can specifically particpate in some limited role, or certainly in their own rites of passage. The controversial topic of how children learn and relate to sexuality in a Wiccan context is well covered. But even that controversy fades somewhat as the prophetic voices of Witchcraft turn to priestly voices (to use Max Weber's language.) Practices, according to Berger, are becoming more standardized, and isomorphic. Two communities, EarthSpirit and Circle Sanctuary, are examined as creative responses to routinization. <br /> <br />The early parts of Berger's volume have much in common with other investigations. This makes them no less valuable, but there is a degree of redundancy in her discussions and \\"thick descriptions\\"of invocations and rituals. Where her work really shines is in her discussion of the role of children and routinzation of practice within magical communities. For these topics in particular, Berger's work is definitely required reading.	2005-03-18

Context	Jone Salomonsen's study of 'Reclaiming Witchcraft' is a hybrid document. Trained originally in systematic theology, she also later undertook ethnographic training, and the result is a combined study as a participant observer, complete with thick description, but also intends to uncover implicit theories of practice and heritage.  In particular, Salomonsen works to demonstrate that the theological focus on \\"immanence, interconnection, and community\\" resembles an older subcultural line of medieval and early modern Christian mysticism, particularly women's mysticism. This broad thesis is not very successful, but other parts of the book are spectacular.    Her most imporant contributions in the book are in the areas of sacred hermeneutics, Reclaiming Goddess thealogy, and Gender.  She contends that Witchcraft hermeutics are vertical--with unifiying of sacred and profane, natural and supernatural, language and action, with the result of creating, magical reality--or what in literary theory would be called Magical Realism--symbol and referent becoming indistinguishable from each other. What Salomonsen calls the embrace of experience as prelinguistic, I would call \\"phenomenological.\\"     In terms of theology, Salomonsen contends that Witches do not divide holy experience into 'immanent' and 'transcendent.' Rather, they may make a distinction between a horizontal manifest pansacrality, and a vertical sacrality where Goddess is experienced as Power or Deity, even materializing in sacred possession (or what might be more directly called mysticism). Her  discussion of multiple selves (or souls) within Reclaming (Deep Self, Younger Self, and Talking Self) are viewed as ways of integrating these pluralist realities concerning phenomenolgical and symbolic experience. In turn, these realms can be accessed through trance and journeywork to locate answers to questions, be overcome by sacred forces, or meet other-than-human persons an opportunities for \\"re-membering\\" Selves.     Thealogicaly,  Salomonsen claims that we are not in the space of just a \\"pantheistic principle,\\" nor  a \\"psychological concept,\\" but rather in a paradoxical space where \\"Goddess is both deity and other-than-deity simultaneously.\\" Following the 1982 theological work of Robert P. Scharleman, Salomonsen differentiates The Goddess in Reclaiming in four levels worth delineating:    1) manifest other-than-deity (Goddess is immanent in creation--Cosmos as Goddess Body)  2) hidden other-than-deity (Goddess as incomprehensible ground of being- always hidden)  3) hidden deity (Goddess's many names and guises, created/decolonized in magical acts of language/power-from-within)  4) manifest deity (Goddess's incarnation as otherness in all beings)    In terms of gender,  Salomonsen draws upon the work of feminist philosopher Luce Irigaray to point to the ethical dilemma of motherhood as both a seat of feminist power and prime subject of dominination--and consequently to see the mother-daughter relationship as the operative field for articulating multiple pluralist feminist ethical roles between women and between Goddess and devotees. The mother-daughter relationship--little mythologized in Western Culture, is approached in Reclaming through the myth of Demeter-Perspehone. Salomonsen's view, based on both introductory and advanced workshops in \\"women's mysteries\\"  is that essentialized notions of gender are used and deployed strategically in Reclaming to establish power-from within for peoples and situations that require it for a specific time and purpose, and that while reified notions of gender have certainly influenced and spread through the Reclaming community, they are constantly challenged and interrogated in a continuing process of dialogue.    There are powerful strengths and contributions of Salomonsen's work, but the historical thesis is weak. She continually to fit Reclaiming thealogy into Protestant Christian theology, or claim that since Judaism and Christianity both contain some immanentist countercultural traditions, and formed the bulk of the cultural landscape many of today's adherents emerged from, that Reclaming Witches are somehow still embedded in Christianity (and to a lesser extent, Judaism). But with the exception of contemporary feminism, all of the elements Salomonsen ascribes to feminist mystics in early modern Europe are also present much earlier (and stronger) in the Perennialist, Gnostic and Hermetic traditions, which have been well-documented as influencing Bynum's Christian feminist mystics, as well as contemporary Pagans (R. Hutton, S. Magliocco, F. Yates, E. Pagels, A. Versluis, J. Godwin). Salomonsen's theological and anthropological contributions are strong--her historical judgments of religious lineage weak.    A much more likely and historically supported linkage is 19th century feminist Spiritualism, Transcendentalism, and Theosophy in the United States, which always had a personalist flavor to it, with the most tenous, if any, links to Christian theology.	2005-03-18
US	52382660	R260T8QP7CL8LB	0742503488	159299267	Daughters of the Goddess: Studies of Identity, Healing, and Empowerment	Books	4	3	3	N	N	A tight, provocative set of essays -- worth investigating	A collection of different essays, mostly from academics and some from practitioners, Wendy Grifin's Daughters of the Goddess is a well-edited collection of essays. The approaches range from anthropological, narrative analysis, historical, psychology, and women's studies, as Griffin points out in the \\"Introduction.\\" <br /> <br />I can't address all the essays, so I will draw out a dominant theme as best I can. From my perspective, the essays are best discussed in terms of concert and conflict--where themes resonate together and where there dissonance and difference is all too apparent. For example, there still exist very real tensions between Witchcraft feminist and other movements in poltiical feminism, especially those coming from a Marxist background, which tend to see all religiosity as false consciouness.  <br /> <br />Princess Diana was no Marxist, but thealogian Melissa Raphael discusses her legacy as a \\"false goddess.\\" Goddess thealogy includes modes of relation that are mutual, severe and sometimes distancing, rather than simply endless unidirectional bounty of mercy and personalized grace. In addition, Raphael does not see the calling and invoking of Goddess names as necessarily \\"worship,\\" but rather a praxis movement that helps women \\"name, own, and realize\\" their power through the invocation of that which is archaic enough to be equally available for power and personalization by women. <br /> <br />This last point is echoed and explicated further by Berger herself, who contends that Goddess invocation-narrative is a dual exercise of re-writing the body in a process of becoming--an embodied thealogy that joins mind and spirit. In this way, both Griffin and Raphael echo the more in-depth investigation of Reclaiming Goddess thealogy by Jone Salomonsen, but go farther in extending this to Goddess worship writ large, instead of just the Reclaiming movement. <br /> <br />Ethnographically speaking, Helen Berger contributes an essay documenting how Wiccan High Priestesses turn to a familiar role, that of motherhood, but in turn reconstruct it as powerful, demanding, sexually charged, with elements of both mercy and severity. <br /> <br />Both of these motif play a role in the transformational politics documented by Susan Greenwood. As part of, and perhaps in response, to postmodern fragmentation, Greenwood sees multivalent concepts of healing at the center of Goddess spirituality. But all these concepts share a primordial vision of original wholism at their center. Sometimes this manifests as ancient matriarchal herstories, sometimes as somatic ecstatic bodily affirmation. <br /> <br />While there were certainly tensions in combining Gardinerian/Alexandrian forms of Wicca with feminism, Feminists quickly adopted some of the history and ideology behind this religious form, and personalized it in order to see out and expose self-hatred as a stepping stone to integrated wholeness. This echoes the introductory essay by Cynthia Eller, also included in a slightly different form in her book \\"Living In The Lap of the Goddess.\\" <br /> <br />All in all, a useful set of starting points and case studies for further examination and extrapolation.	2005-03-18
US	52382660	R8LDYN0MI15TD	080701110X	621563339	Changing of the gods: Feminism and the end of traditional religions	Books	4	21	21	N	N	A Strong, Utopian, Feminist Classic in Religious Studies	Naomi Goldenberg's 1979 Beacon volume, published in the same year as \\"The Spiral Dance\\" and \\"Drawing Down The Moon\\", is a strong, powerful manifesto for feminist power in the religious realm. \\"Changing of the Gods\\"is concerned to demonstrate that as more and more feminists become involved with religion, whether in the dominant Western fields of Judaism and Christianity, or in feminist witchcraft, there presence and power would irrevocably change the nature of religion, overthrowing Yahweh and Christ. Yet this overthrow for Goldenberg is not a *complete* destruction, but rather allows for their eventual return, once they have learned their place alongside female divinity. <br /> <br />It is important to point out that Goldenberg also makes a strong case against the ability of feminists to reform, rather than destroy, Judaism and Christianity. For she sees, along with Mary Daly and others, an irreducible elements of sexism in the nature of Christ as male, or in the Torah and Talmud in Judaism. While somewhat respectful, perhaps her harshest criticism is reserved for reform feminists, whom she calls \\"naive\\" and \\"deluded.\\" Rather, she re-reads and enlists Freud as exposing the essential father-son relationships at the heart of Judaism and Christianity in \\"Totem and Taboo\\", as well as \\"Moses and Monotheism.\\" While sympathetic to Carl Jung, she openly takes him to task for his racism and essentialization of the \\"feminine.\\" <br /> <br />Interestingly, she extends the same argumentation against valorizing alleged \\"ancient matriarchal societies,\\" lest those same models limit futures for women. But she does encourage dis-covering of experience over text and the formation of psychic mysticisms based on women's experiences as religiously important, and in turn this imgined \\"psychological polytheism\\" must be brought into tangibility--the imagination (including dreams), as so often it is in the Western esoteric tradition, must be seen as an organ of perception, rather than deception. <br /> <br />Also, Goldenberg's notion of religion deserves clarification--it is not that she sees herself prophesizing literal death of powerful deities, rather she is a psychological reductionist--religion is a projection of psychology. But for her, this is no less powerful and meaningful for existing in the mind only, and so her work turns toward those recovering and re-visioning religion internally, individually, so that people begin to share the creative process of poesis rather than sharing the same myths and symbols. In this she points to the feminist thealogy and practice of witchcraft, as articulated by Starhawk and Z Budapest, as prophetic religion in action. Goldenberg's specifc contribution is to outline 12 phenomenological qualities of feminist witchcraft that challenge scholars and others who seek to examine it. <br /> <br />in the end, these again are related to larger political concerns--men's distance from acts of child-rearing, feeding, and other early somatic aspects of parenting inculcate a distance and transcendence of the world that results ultimately in actions such as polluting, excessive logging, and environmental destruction. <br /> <br />Goldenberg's work is a classic in the field, and stands as an early, unapologetic work delineating contours and areas of concern with feminist experience, thealogies, and religion, without avoiding conflict and confrontation with other feminists over these same issues.	2005-03-16

Robert S. Ellwood wrote his volume on religion in the 1960's before his volume on the 1950's, but its clear from his other work that he has long been interested in underground and alternative religious movements, as well as documenting periods of intense religious ferment. And in most treatments of American Religious History, the 1960's serve a crucial turning point--although often this takes the form of a mantra-like recitation of the fact that official church attendance declined dramatically for the first time, with many assumptions and little investigation into what that might actually mean. <br /> <br />Ellwood's argument builds on the edifice of research constructed around historical theories of modernism and postmodernism. Foucault, Derrida, Lyotard, and many others have written on the transition or development of postmodernity, a condition in which the demands of subjects for change and unity both outstrip institutional abilities to satisfy them. Thus, an era of radical skepticism begins toward overarching metanarratives, such as universal progress, and the unity of all knowledge. As an example, Ellwood credits the radical ideological leveling of the \\"elite and marginalized\\" of the civil rights movement (a progressive, optimistic modernist movement itself) with undercutting modernism--calling for more change than \\"could be met by modernist means.\\" <br /> <br />Or so the story goes. The 1960's, with its fracturing of New Deal Liberalism, the rise of both Liberal and Conservative Imperial Presidents, and the massive forced mobilization of  allegedly \\"free\\" citizens to fight wars on behalf of the U.S. government, becomes this 'pressure cooker' for 1950's ideology to sprout new and inventive religious  and cultural communities to replace older ones found wanting. Of course, the liberalization of the Catholic Church with Vatican II, and changes in domestic immigration laws made some of this change possible as well. <br />  <br />Ellwood follows a familiar strategy- \\"divide and explain.\\" The 1960's are divided into four sub-eras---The '50s Under Pressure, Secular Hope, The Year of the Avatars (1967) and the Bitter Years. <br /> <br />As Ellwood rightly points out, the same years that saw declining church attendance, also saw an explosion of several important factors--the social gospel in action, especially in the Selma March, radical theology, entheogens, the Death of God movement, popular Gnosticism, and the first flowering of contemporary feminist and Pagan religion in the U.S. To this end, we must look not only at church attendance, but at the sometimes nascent but ultimately powerful and transformative cultural beginnings (or resurgences, since there has always been a personalist strain of religion among the American unchurched) <br /> <br />And that in fact is where Ellwood goes, discussing in depth the secularization thesis and Death of God theology (as the last outburst of religious modernism) as well as the growth and development of 'fringe' sects during those mid-60's years of 'secular hope'--Krshna Consciousness, Church of Satan, the Acid Church, other forms of chemical/entheogenic mysticism, and even the role of William Blake revivals. <br /> <br />At the end of the day, Ellwood sees several themes emerge from the 1960's--including a rediscovery of natural religion, a \\"discovery of the world\\" as the place of theology and practice, an ongoing quest in freedom, and the shift to a radically nonconformist paradigm. While some of Ellwood's points here are crystal clear, others need more demonstration. But it is clear that by all this, Ellwood does not mean a trend towards politically liberal religion. On the contrary, the most popular forms of Pentacostalism, or what he calls Political Christian 'Shamanism' (including Barry Goldwater's candidacy) and deconstructionist theology all have spawned reactionary movements in their own right. Whatever the final religious upshot is from the 1960's is, its' still undetermined. <br /> <br />This book is best read along with Amanda Porterfield's \\"The Transformation of American Religion\\"	2005-03-14
US	52382660	R1EODUWS3XSG03	081352346X	25522559	The Fifties Spiritual Marketplace: American Religion in a Decade of Conflict	Books	4	7	7	N	N	Accessible, Critical, Readable, and Well-Constructed	Robert Ellwood, a former Episcopal minister and expert on alternative and underground religions, has written a generally fine volume rethinking the role of religion in the 1950s. His premises follow largely from the iconoclastic work of Finke and Stark, and on the explosion of religion during this time period along multiple differing axes of analysis. At the same time his conclusions are more mainstream than Finke and Stark's, and his history of ideas focus is a welcome complement to other modes of analysis. <br /> <br />As always, Ellwood begins with historical grounding. What must be firmly grasped about the 1950's above all else, is that it was a post-war period. Much of the confidence in modernist ideas that existed before WWI, The Worldwide Great Depression, and WWII was shredded through recent history. At the same time, with the advent of the fission (and soon, the fusion bomb) the relief and capital expansionism of the postwar era was tempered with apocalyptic fears concerning nuclear war and the political threat of both communism and third world indigenous nationalism. There are contrasting views of why church attendance skyrocketed--but there can be little doubt of its growth. Constant change and innovation through capitalism produced not only prosperity, but public anxiety over ongoing challenges to gender and racial roles,. These anxieties were tempered and adjusted to with the assistance of religious community-building for baby-booming families. The ways that churches capitalized on consumerist approaches to marketing no doubt was as significant in the 1950's as it was in the Progressive Era. Consensus ideology among many churches, Ellwood thinks, also help cement Jewish and Catholic identities as authentic forms of 'Americanness.' <br /> <br />But similar impulses--fear and uncertainty, gave rise to American popular existentialism, both naturalist and Christian. UFO religion also expanded. Ellwood sees these both as a natural outgrowth of Cold War fearsof instant destruction, and hopes for some form of outside intervention. (94). Commonalities exist for Ellwood in alternative leaders such as Thomas Merton, A.J. Muste, George Adamski, M.K. Ghandhi, D.T. Suzuki, Aldous Huxley and the movements inspired by them, for they all sought visions of community, however different from the mainstream. Different alternative responses were nonetheless united by a challenge to consensus forms of identity and being, even if their responses ranged from mystical and psychological introspection to the wanderlust of an American Beat Bhikku. <br /> <br />Liberals are not forgotten either. The World Council of Churches is covered, and set into its post -Bikini Atoll context well. The 1955 emergence of M.L. King as a major religious activist figure becomes a focal point for soul-searching among white churches and adherents, especially as the new movement takes advantage of the media. But with Ellwood it is the waning mainline of Protestantism, and growing alternatives, both radical and reactionary, that begin an ongoing crescendo during the last few years of the 1950's. <br /> <br />For Ellwood, the 1950's in the U.S. can be best summed up as the last modern religious decade. By this Lyotardian analysis, he means that it was the last time period when the metanarrative of universal progress and metanarrative of the unity of knowledge held such sway over the American religious public. Both of these collapse for Ellwood in the 1960's to inaugurate a postmodern religious environment. In the early to mid 1950's, there is consensus--the consensus of fear and unease coexisting with prosperity. In the 1960's for Ellwood, any sense of consensus would crumble. <br /> <br />There is much to admire in Ellwood's treatment, especially the market-oriented focus and capitalist context so often missing in American religious history. Ellwood 's focus is on intellectual history, and the milieu created by it, so we shouldn't be surprised at the relative lack of, for example, sociological data that bases much of Robert Wuthnow's work. Its a valuable complement to more quantitative studies, and Ellwood's movement toward rational choice theory, as exemplified by Finke and Stark, has much to offer. <br /> <br />The difficulties this work has are similar to other works trying to get a hold on recent American religious history. The 1960's are often designated as a turning point, and while this may be true in some sense, the effects of the Great Depression and WWII are hard to overstate. Perhaps the 1950's were a last ditch effort at unity and consensus following these blows to modernist liberal progressivism, but existential unity in the face of despair seems potentially as postmodern to me as anything the 1960's had to offer. Likewise, the growth of smaller sects throughout the 20th century (and in the 19th) cannot be dismissed as a product of the crazy 1960's. In fact, Finke and Stark, who are so prominently displayed in Ellwood's writing, have contended that more religious movements were founded in the 1980's and 1970's than the 1960's, and that the 1950's had its share as well, just under the numbers of the '60s. Other drawbacks are those common to intellectual history--such as the tendency of it to occasionally disintegrate into the history of particular personalities, rather than broader intellectual trends. <br /> <br />So I think the verdict is still out on the comparative roles of the 1930's and 1940's versus the 1960's in the shaping of American religion, but Ellwood makes it clear that both exerted strong connections, each in their own way, to the religious culture of the 1950's.	2005-03-04

It is intended for students and interested non-students, rather than the religionist per se, and is written from a balanced, critical point of view. Her introduction provides a quick guide to most other major works of this kind, including Graham Harvey's study, and is a vast improvement over other, more polemical studies, such as Philip Davis's \\"The Goddess Unmasked.\\" Pike's biggest challenge, and a controversial one, is to include yet separate New Age and Pagan religion from each other. Her efforts are probably more successful in this area than other attempts to either totally distinguish them or collapse them together.<br /><br />What makes Pike's study different is that her goal is not to provide a comprehensive guide to traditions and practices. Rather, her work concentrates on situating the contours of these religions in an American historical context, and demonstrating their continuity, as well as divergence, from other aspects of American Religious History. As well her main areas of investigation are trends in in healing, gender/sexuality, apocalypticism/millenialism, and in the ethics or style of practice, rather than content or specific denominations. This is significant because New Age and Neopagan religions are radically decentralized movements. Lacking a single charasmatic leader, or even one authoritative organization, these movements are for the most part, difficult to study. Unlike early century or 19th century esotericisms, they lack founding texts, or single leaders.<br /><br />Pike begins by spending a chapter compressing and extending, in parts, America's unchurched religious traditions, including Spiritualist trance, which she considers a significant antecedent to Pagan possession and New Age channeling. We know that Spiritualist demonstrations were attended by many, including Abraham Lincoln, Mary Todd Lincoln, Harriet Beecher Stowe, and James Fenimore Cooper. One of the major ways spirits communicated in Spiritualism was by \\"rapping,\\" or making noises then interpreted in a narrative fashion. As well, Spiritualist publications and proponents were widely known to engage in ethical advocacy of issues of the day, including the treatment of Amerindians, liberal causes such as death penalty reform, and wage reform, causes advocated by many (but not all) New Agers and Pagans. While discussing Neolithic and Jungian approaches in Pagan myth, Pike firmly locates these traditions as emerging from mid-20th century revivals and transformations of 19th century (and earlier modes of religious expression), even as many Pagans trace their deities directly to classical sources. Pike correctly traces the focus on personalization in this form of religion to the highly personal, ecstatic, and optimistic ways Americans have historically related to sacred power, such as reformist movements and the Great Awakenings. One debatable point is her location of the \\"birth\\" of NeoPaganism in the United States with the founding of Feraferia and the Church of All Worlds in 1967.<br /><br />While many New Age practitioners and Pagans tend to pursue worship and transformation in an entirely private way, there are those who pursue a highly political and even oppositional form of public worship. In Ottawa in 2001 at the World Bank meeting protests, a Pagan group formed a \\"living river\\" as part of the protest. At the School of the Americas Protest in Columbus, Georgia, in the same month, several religious groups, including a group of Witches, conducted an \\"Earth-Based Blessing.\\" Issac Bonewits has been regularly promoting the use of spellwork in encouraging people to participate in the Democratic process in the United States, calling for collective simultaneous action over the Internet, and teaching political ritual workshops at Pagan Festivals. Others take a wider view of activism beyond the nation-state.Some groups take political action in the form of ecological magic, or conducting rituals as threatened natural sites. As well, some of these sites may be contested with indigenous peoples, which adds a whole other dimension and layer of complexity to this issue. Gender activism is particularly important, given the connection to feminism which transformed the movements in the 1960's. Pike as well discusses the tensions between Goddess as mythic symbol, feminine life-force, structuring reality, and ontological literal truth, and clearly debunks much of the fantastic myths surrounding sexuality and its relationship to worship and practice.<br /><br />Healing plays a central role for New Agers and Neopagans, according to Pike. The influence of wholism and health movements in the United States has a long history in religious communities as well. But its interpenetration with the New Age and Neopagan movements was key to the development of each during the 1970's. Religiously, the older inherited occult notions of correspondence and interconnectedness promote analogical healing of \\"macrocosm\\" and \\"microcosm.\\" The increasing emphasis on a spiritual side to science, including Hindu and Chinese interpolations with quantum mechanics and relativity, gave weight to the increasing view that life and its environment interact at the levels of subtle threads, layers, and relationships of energy. Herbalism continues to be common, with its ties into folk medicine and vernacular lore, while auric healing and direct manipulation/transformation of subtle energies, at the other end of the spectrum, is easily as well known. Sometimes energy manipulation via earthen means combines these notions, such as in crystal healing. Deities may also be part of the healing process. Nuturing powers may be called upon, but ones of fierce defense, and regeneration, such as Kali, are commonplace as well. In any case, Pike continues to make the point that self-exploration and self-understanding are in many cases, foundational to New Age or Pagan forms of healing, both in the sense of deconstruction and regeneration.<br /><br />Apocalyticism is treated by Pike in a single chapter. The scope of the spectrum she explores again ranges from a totalistic immediate shift in the physical environment to personal transformation. There is more than some elitism among New Age practictioners and Neopagans who see themselves as part of a vanguard that will help usher in the elite, and a corresponding underlying concern that those dragging their feet, so to speak, may not end up with a share in this future world, or paradigm. Pike locates much of her discussion of Pagan Sacred Geography, or dedicated sacred lands, to this topic.<br /><br />Highly recommended for the student, general reader, or historian of American Religion.

At the end of WWII, Wuthnow believes common assumptions about religion existed. First, it was Biblically-based, congregational, but with indivdualistic tendencies. 2 out of 3 persons attended a church once a month or more, and 42% attended every week. \\"Protestant, Catholic, or Jew\\" was the main question. <br /> <br />After WWII, the dominant mode of religious institutions interacting with the larger society was to instruct and inspire individuals. A comcommittent focus on ethics, social justice as part of the larger sense of declaring Christian principles. A spirit of public evangelism and private education held sway, not the least as an indirect demonstration of political muscles. As education became increasingly common and with it the growth of the state, religious institutions adapted by forming and expanding educational curricula of their own. The emphasis on education was given two emphases. From the conservative side beliefs and the process of arriving at those beliefs became a standard for the articulation of genuine values. Liberals in turn tended toward not the content of beliefs, but rather a procedural validation of the process of coming to a set of beliefs. In the 1950's, these divisions began forming, even as all kinds of denominations exploded in growth. <br /> <br />According to Wuthnow, perhaps one of the most important developments in 20th century American religious life has been the development of special purpose groups. These groups grew from a few dozen after the Civil War to about 150 at the turn of the century. Since from 1960 to the 1980's, about 300 were formed, bringing the post-WWII total to around 500. This is not remarkable when compared with other nonprofit and voluntary associations, many of which have grown more than religious ones. But in comparsison with religious denominations, it has been spectacular growth overall. General levelsof affluence and leisure time have provided the fuel for growth. Wuthnow argues though, that both directly and indirectly, the State is the biggest factor in the growth of such associations, as different groups seek to encourage, restrain, or influence particular aspects of civil policy and state growth. <br /> <br />At the same time, Wuthnow also draws attention to the disillusionment in government brought through the Vietnam War, Watergate, and the Roe vs. Wade decision. He argues that the subsequent rise and popularity of morality as a public issue and its intimate connection to government and policy helped legitimate the rise of the political evangelicals, even as the denominational hierarchies were increasingly dominated by theological liberals. Conservative evangelicals took advantage and built the public terms of a debate in which their morals and values were assumed to be part of the national spotlight and the national debate, while arguing that in the field of morality liberals were either absent altogether or illmoral in some way, rather than just different in their views. <br /> <br />This is a major work in the sociology of religion, even as its language is a bit outdated and at times, very parochial and condescending towards the new religious movements of the 1950's and 1960's. Overall though, it is required reading (coupled with Robert Ellwood, and Robert Fuller) and on the development of 20the century religion in the U.S. Wuthnow does try to place almost all the impetus for change on the State, (and the New Deal philosophy) but tends to overly downplay to what extent Americans demanded changes in race, gender, immigration, and military policy on their own first.	2005-01-14

Writing for an informed but not always scholarly audience, Fuller's book is a work of synthesis. By its own admission it adds nothing substantial to the specific phenomena discussed, but performs a much more valuable function. For what is perhaps the first time, a religious historian has done for American Metaphysics and Spirituality what Jocelyn Godwin did for English-speaking esoteric world (in \\"The Theosophical Enlightenment.\\") <br /> <br />Fuller traces the beginnings of unchurched spirituality, and brings to a more popular light what early American religion scholars have known for some time, that despite much hot air to the contrary, early America had a very low church attendance, down to 1/6th of the population around the Revolutionary War. Instead, non-ecclesial forms of spirituality and religious magic, the heritage of Elizabethan occultism, filled much of the practical religious void left by a distant, judgmental Calvinist god. But even at this early stage, Fuller (citing Perry Miller) uncovers that there is a link to immanence and pantheism found even as early as Jonathan Edwards, and finding fruition in a series of religious awakenings, in the early 1800's, after the Civil War through the early part of the 20th century, and in the years from 1960-1975. We see American Swedenborgianism, Transcendentalism, Mesmerism, and Spiritualism linked in a history of religious themes and impulses. We even see both the well-known technical side of Spiritualism, and the lesser known but just-as-vital speculative side, with the writings of Andrew Jackson Davis. Connecting these impulses to the development of Emersonian pantheism, Theosophical esotericism, and the development of Humanistic Psychology in William James, Ken Wilbur, and Carl Rogers, we begin to get a sense of the multi-threaded history of non-ecclesial religion that has grown up alongside more widely acknowledged institutions. <br /> <br />If there is a weakness to Fuller's work it is that the writing is at times not consistent, and well-made points are sometimes re-emphasized redundantly across chapters. As well, the contributions of Amerindian and African/African-American spirituality are mostly absent, although receiving occasional nods. But overall, this pioneering effort deserves high marks for its (extremely overdue) daringness to discuss contemporary Paganism and Goddess worship in the same vein and impulse as Ralph Waldo Emerson's forays, and James' emphasis on personal experience. The price and effort of the volume alone are rewarded by a single chapter, which attempts to draw cross-era generalities between these metaphysical non-ecclesial forms of religion. And for Fuller's concise and consistent rebuke of Robert Wuthnow's, Sydney Ahlstrom's, and Robert Bellah's heavy-handed and opportunistic criticisms of this ongoing, vital, and enduring tradition, he earns praise. This places him more in line with perhaps the other scholar of his stature studying this tradition, Robert Ellwood. <br /> <br />Christopher Chase, PhD Fellow, American Studies	2004-12-29

Specifically its an adaption of  Slavoj Zizek's pop culture adaptation of Jacques Lacan's version of psychoanalysis. <br /> <br />For David Schwartz, listening is the process of unpacking the \\"musical-theoretical, musical-historical, cultural, psychoanalytic, and personal dimensions\\"---listening is both a fantasy thing and a fantasy space. The \\"thingness\\" we hear in listening is produced as structural elements in a musical piece are related to each other--this is a function of composition and performance. The \\"spaceness\\" is produced when embedded cultural thresholds that make structural elements possible are crossed or exposed in a subject. In other words, space is produced as a function of reception and internal interaction with qualities of the subject. <br /> <br />As consistent with psychoanalytic theory--both of these illusory products--thingness and space----are retrospective and illusory since there can be no unmediated \\"immannent\\" access to events that structured our subjectivity or historical contexts. 'There ain't no goin' home.' You can't go back to the womb, since after your Oedipal complex is resolved you can only seek failed substitutions for the mother over time.  <br />  <br />Schwartz postulates music as sonorous envelope and acoustic mirror....being enveloped by music is a fantasy---a representation of an experience to which no one could have direct access. When enveloped in listening, the body's self-perceptual boundaries can temporarily collapse, leading to the formation of an \\"archaic body\\"--less bounded from the external world than the genuine body. This ocean is a womb fantasy--being at home with the \\"touch, smell, and voice of the mother...\\"shortly after birth, Appropriating Lacan, Schwartz notes this as the acoustic-mirror stage, in which the infant tries to match its voice to the mother. <br /> <br />The threshold-crossing aspects of music (like when you get goosebumps, and your body's boundaries start to fuzz out) reacts with your own history of threshold-crossing events, much like transitioning from the mirror stage to the Symbolic Order, to produce distant reconstructions of these psychoanalytic moments. <br /> <br />For Schwartz, all this is especially true of what is often called the new minimalism--such as John Adams, Philip Glass, Steve Reich, and so forth. Minimalist music often combines repeated eighth note or sixteenth note ostinatoes with pitch content drawn from \\"traditional harmonies of the Canon--particularly the semitonal voice leading of the German tradition of the mid-nineteenth century. Archaic yet familiar is the relationship here. Accompanying figuration rises to the primary space, rather than the secondary. As examples, Schwatrz cites the Steve Reich / Kronos Quartet's Different Trains (a personal favorite as well). In that piece, Violas initiate pitched phrases, which are then taken over by voice--indicative of the transition from one psychoanalytic stage to another.  <br /> <br />In a larger sense, these mirrors can be seen more publicly by examining both the playful fascinations people have with producing echoes across canyons, or the emptiness felt on hearing the echoes of abandoned rooms, or the dread of hearing echoes of steps in dark stairwells. <br /> <br />In each example he turns his attention to, Schwartz provides a more formalistic exposition of chord progressions, augmented triads, knocking percussion rifts, and tritone substitutions, as in The Beatles \\"I Want You (She's So Heavy),\\" which is read as representing an acoustic fantasy of union with the female object of desire *(le petit object a). Scatting and Unison singing, overdubbing, and the rising use of white noise during the last 3 minutes of constant choral repetition--looking within the \\"nightmarish nothingness within male desire.\\" And the A-natural slash that unnervingly cuts if off. <br /> <br />Schwartz's work, like all cultural analyses from a psychoanalytic perspective (or any methodology for that matter) are useful mostly depending on how accepting you are of the method. The advantages of these readings are that that elements that signify distinctly (like the whistles in Peter Gabriel's \\"Intruder\\") are already cross-indexed with other visual and audial representations. Whistles can outline women's bodies for the male gaze (like wolf whistles) or signify male gender bonding (\\"Bridge on the River Kwai\\"), for example. Therefore, sets of cultural indicators are at the ready. The price paid for this ready-made \\"index\\" is its closure to other worlds of interpretation. <br /> <br />Having said all that--if you want to experience psychoanalytic methods used to interpret both Western Classical and Popular music, then Schwartz does a fine job, and his readings provide provocative thought for Music Studies and Psychoanalysis scholars.	2004-11-09

And thankfully, because of this, David has allowed me to suggest pre-publication comments and and in some small way perhaps add to the fine scholarship of this project.  <br /> <br /> In \\"How Sweet the Sound,\\" David Stowe points out that music plays a \\"variety of roles in religious life.\\" Socially, its a means of transmitting behavioral and belief codes. Phenomenologically, it serves as a channel for means of ecstatic communication through the infusion of power, or as a means for liturgical address and response. Additionally, sacred music accumulates additional meanings over time, layered and even disjunctive in content. These accumulations often occur for invountary as well as voluntary reasons, as music bears the markers of community exclusion, exile, and conquest. In sociological terms, music is part and parcel of creation and maintenance of a religious \\"habitus.\\" But this always occurs in a broader web of contexts--economic, political, and othewise. <br /> <br /> Stowe's approach is to draw broad, yet circumscribed historical contours by examining prominent case studies. His approach is deliberately and commandingly pluralistic, a pluralism extending both within and beyond Christianity. Yet his larger point is that even at its most radically pluralistic and sectarian, stories and narratives from the Hebrew Bible have become and maintained their predominant place in American religious music, and by extension, American religious life. The story of Exodus, in many ways, is the story of Mormons, Shakers, African-Americans, 19th century Esotericists, and Sun Ra's \\"Afro-Futurism.\\" <br /> <br /> Along the way, we see clear trends delineated--such as a tradition of strongly bodily affective religious music in the United States. This should be no surprise, given the primacy of the Hebrew Bible as a source for allegory, metaphor and narrative in Christian religious music. The Biblical Song of Solomon is especially strong in its use of eroticism as religious devotion. Likewise, Moravian hymms have been characterized as \\"impassioned, full of vivid imagery of Christ's atoning blood and a nearly erotic emphasis on communion with Christ.\\" Methodist hymns, especially those influenced by John Wesley, were in many ways a reaction against this tendency. In a more general sense, neither of the Wesleys could stop the development of American Shaker hymns. Though not erotic in nature, Shaker hymns were certainly affective. Producing visions of ecstasy and celestial kingdoms, and \\"divine communication,\\" they danced in the set of affective relationships that has been part of the Christian tradition, especially its mystical subtraditions, since its earliest days. Even in the political and religious mainstream of music in the 18th and 19th century United States, William Billings' patriotic hymms produced \\"inchanting\\" and \\"ecstatic\\" erotic songs. <br /> <br /> Together with both Methodist austerity and impassioned eroticism, Stowe adds the secular and sacred histories of songs such as \\"Amazing Grace,\\" from its use in American civil religion to its expression in Star Trek's funeral for Mr. Spock, and Judy Collins's theurgically protective use of it in the midst of the turbulence of the 1960's. The World Parliament of Religions and the Immigration Act of 1965 are highlighted as catalytic moments in American religious pluralism, helping to give birth to events as diverse as Paul Carus's Buddhist hymnals, the Beastie Boys \\"Bodhisattva Vow\\" and Duke Ellington's pluralistically affirming sacred concerts.  <br /> <br /> And yet we return to the Hebrew Bible again and again, especially in Stowe' examination of Rabbinic cantoring, Kol Nidre, and the controversy surrounding movie \\"The Jazz Singer.\\" Moody, Sankey, and the Fisk Jubillee Singers are not to be outdone, as the Civil War's role in generating Manichean,  patriotic, even Prodigal calls to battle are brought carefully and vividly to life. <br />  <br /> This is a highly recommended book. While engaging contemporary concerns such as race, class, gender, and imperialism, this volume goes deeper, and refuses to be bound by specific time periods or specific religious traditions. Where necessary, Stowe crosses all sorts of boundaries to follow the trajectories of songs composed, read, re-read, and re-appropriated in vastly different contexts, from sociology to existentialism. In its dogged devotion to follow different crossing threads of music over time and tradition, as well as the  tropes and relationships inscribed within them and by them in adherents. By all means suitable for students of Religious Studies, Stowe's book also stands as well within the perhaps more eclectic but no less rigorous interdisciplinary tradition of American Studies.	2004-10-26

Discussing American nationalism (or the maintenance of counter-nationalisms) from the perspective of various Amerindian nations is especially problematic, for these nations and populations remain under colonial geographical and cultural occupation to this day in a sense that is not true for other populations in the United States. In Ojibwe Singers: Hymns, Grief, and a Native Culture in Motion, Michael McNally works to uncover the politics of ritual power and performance with regard to the practice of Ojibwe (Anishinaabe)  hymn singing. For the Ojibwe, the very real development in harmonic and narrative structure of Christian hymn-singing,  nonetheless camouflaged the incommensurability and resilience of Ojibwe language to subjugation from colonial missionary concepts and relations to sacrality. Thus, as McNally demonstrates, a close analysis of Ojibwe hymnody  as developed before the 1870's reveals a strong continuity with this-worldly concerns of Ojibwe religion and living life in proper relation to the web of nature through an economy of power (manidoo), rather than an emphasis on Christian transcendence as exemplified by the original English words. Moreover, the Ojibwe Christians, the Anami'aajig, among whom this tradition is strong, see their religious commitment in terms of the practice or ritual prayer, and acting as ones-who-pray, rather than in terms of believing a set of theological suppositions. These ritual prayers turns out to be very different than the hymns intended to be passed along by Christian missionaries. <br /> <br />McNally accomplishes this project by setting up the history of Ojibwe/Missionary encounter alongside the original missionary hymns side by side with the Ojibwe versions, and then English retranslations of the Ojibwe. The retranslations show that Ojibwe (Chippewa) language is itself quite resistant to co-optation by Christian missionaries. While the same words often show through the translations--the words themselves, like \\"world,\\" \\"heaven,\\" and \\"sin\\" just do not mean the same thing. What this implies is that two cultures can sing the exact same words in a hymn, but yet be singing totally different songs. For example, \\"sin\\" (baataziwin) and \\"grace\\"(zhawenjiigewin) don't have the character of human helplessness and outside holy intervention in Ojibwe. The terms used imply a simple temporary upset of the integrated relationships of Nature (Bimaadiziwin) the actions undertaken in pity to repair these relationships. Throughout the songs transcendence largely becomes immanence, although the language is as faithful as possible. And the form of performance changed too--as the Ojibwe hymnody largely became associated with moments of grieving and potential loss of persons to the community, and the Ojibwe continued to largely reject or become indifferent to other forms of Christian religious instruction, even as they began to identify themselves as Christians. <br /> <br />This is especially important  as two sets of communities took shape in Ojibwe culture over time, one community less assimilated and less economically developed (in an `Anglo' sense) and one more assimilated and more economically integrated into the dominant narrative of `mainstream' American life. The culture of the former became folklorized, preserved as historical artifact yet emasculated from the power to address its more assimilated audience. Yet the practice of hymn prayer itself indigenizes Christianity to Anami'aawin, and its continued practice functions to re-member and maintain a \\"geography of home,\\" a \\"singing sodality,\\" or a continued nation identity of Ojibwe in the midst of all-too common violent death/loss of community members, not to mention other ongoing issues related to being occupied and colonized. This habitus of hymnody, this \\"embodied history\\" then is the practice of `accommodating' hope, the practice of `resistant' community-indeed the practice of cultural nationalism,  in the face of many forces of dis-memberment, through the ongoing American nationalist colonization. <br />But we cannot stop there, for while we could argue that the preoccupation of white American-ness since the early days of its inception was the place of \\"Indianness,\\" within a cultural politics of core and periphery,  this would misplace the agency examined in McNally's work, which is that of the Ojibwe. In the face of being marginalized (to put it mildly) hymn singing functions to rekindle the identity of the Ojibwe, drawing the departed away from physical death (a limnal periphery to the world in terms of Ojibwe cosmology) into an ongoing core of Ojibwe religious personhood. This is simultaneously replicated in the larger pattern of re-membering the Ojibwe core away from \\"forgetting,\\" [a cultural death], and contesting \\"American\\"ness, which is, for the Ojibwe, perhaps the ultimate peripheralization. <br /> <br />I do want to point out that this project resists the term \\"religion\\" in many ways, which is vitally important to undestand. McNally's own conception of Ojibwe hymnody frames it as lifeway \\"practice,\\" and the process of creating this sound object is for him always already bound in the historical process of Ojibwe language. In Ojibwe religiosity, as with many Amerindians, the emphasis is on personhood, power, and place all negotiated within the field of language, which reflects the underlying assumptions of the lifeway.  <br /> <br />Moreover, for the Ojibwe the hardships of contemporary life become a form of `penitential supplication' in their lifeway/religion. Deliberately produced Ojibwe hymn sound objects then occur in the context of the promotion and re-membering Bimaadiziwin (\\"Nature,\\" understood both as it is and as it should be) in the face of  physical challenges like the death of persons, and cultural \\"forgetting,\\" which is itself a kind of death. Therefore this music exists neither purely as entertainment culture, as in modern capitalist societies, nor as a worship of transcendence, asin most forms of Christianity. Yet it undergoes historical shifts like aspects of any other \\"culture in motion.\\" Whereas once Ojibwe music was primarily concerned with thaumaturgical power, the \\"new Ojibwe\\" music was transformed by its encounters with missionary, as well as other ongoing pressures related to continuing occupation, into a negotiated process/product of colonization.  Specifically McNally terms Ojibwe hymn music a \\"rekindling\\" of and within the habitus of Ojibwe Bimaadiziwin- a praxis of hope and \\"re-membering\\" of the community in the face of dismemberment pressures.	2004-10-15
US	52382660	R2TBE67HRNNFI	080784862X	196961560	Romancing the Folk: Public Memory and American Roots Music (Cultural Studies of the United States)	Books	4	22	25	N	N	Strong and Engaging, and Very Readable	Benjamin Filene's account of the origins of the category of \\"American roots music\\" is inexorably aimed at peeling away discursive layers within that very term itself to reveal the historical continuities and disjunctures at the heart of it. As Filene puts it: \\"What makes the formation of America's folk canon so fascinating, though, is that just as isolated cultures became harder to define and locate in industrialized America. the notions of musical purity and primitivism took on enhanced value, even in avowedly commercial music. Twentieth-century Americans have been consistently searching for the latest incarnation of 'old-time' and 'authentic' music.\\" And Filene shows deftly how these categories are heavily inflected with racial and class issues. <br /> <br />But Filene's work begins much earlier, with the early 19th century effort in the US and later in the UK to collect and collate British folk song texts and sometimes the tunes that went this them. He demonstrates that this effort was thoroughly infused with romanticism--an attempt to record and preserve a \\"better\\" culture before capitalism, greed, irreligion and science came along. This grew from the German philosophical fascination with the 'Kultur des Volkes,' and into an impulse to forge a British national culture based on the English peasantry---even sometimes as found in the American Appalachian population (!)---and of course, an undertone, made explicit here and there--of racial purity.  <br /> <br />This is especially significant in that popular interest in anything like folk song appears to have begun for African-American forms before Anglo ones--but was apparently stopped by the mythic valorization of whites as true folk. It seems that Anglo songs edged out other types as the basis of this new mythic canon that was forming, even as the Fisk singers and blackface minstrelsy became more popular in the 1870's. In fact, Filene argues convincingly that the way in which Black folk songs (spirituals) were collated preserved an idea of Black passivity and the exotic gaze in whites. Of course blackface minstrel performances reinforced this. The only other challenge was Lomax's collection of cowboy ballads, which he unsuccessfully tried to peg to the spirit of English rural culture. In the 1920's attempts at using a more racially and geographically inclusive cultural building with rural songs, white, black, and latino, were undertaken by poet Carl Sandburg. <br /> <br />Most of the book deals with the legacy of the cult of authenticity created and shaped by the Lomaxes from their field recordings and artist promotion. Their zeal for collecting and promoting their ideas of \\"true folk singers\\" cannot be underestimated, and in doing so, they shifted the canon away from whiteness, or so it seemed.  Filene's account of The Lomaxes and Lead Belly perhaps best demonstrates the role of exoticism in producing authentic \\"American\\"ness at that particular time.  The tours undertaken by the Lomaxes emphasize Lead Belly's virtuosity and expansive knowledge, but simultaneously construct him as a primitive, exotic \\"Heart of Darkness\\" figure that lay at the core of authentic American folk-song, and by extension lay at the periphery of contemporary, decadent, urban white Modernist America.  When they started to get not only recording techonology, but official government and Library of Congress support, that added an entire new dimension of national culture building, as well as \\"documentary\\"-style authoritativeness  to their work--as they literally began constructing a usable musical past for the United States. <br /> <br />In fact, Filene's analysis fits perfectly with Jacques Attali's theories on music, insofar as Lead Belly's music could be said to be a constructed and promoted by Lomax as a sublimated form of `animal nature' (ancestor) and racialized `primitive violence' (demon), exhibited in spectacle for the consumption of middle-brow and high-brow white audiences. Filene connects thisracialized legacy of \\"authenticity\\" with the commonly found ideology that \\"roots\\" musicians even today are expected to be overly emotive,  premodern, and non-commercial. In other words, they must perform \\"Otherness\\" for their predominantly white, bourgeois audiences in order to be authentic. To be fair, this impulse waxed strong in 1930's American. James Agee and Walker Evans. Steinbeck's \\"Grapes of Wrath,\\" a number of popular magazines--, all played into this impulse. To be popular though, you couldn't be too successful, or you might compromise your authenticity. Sound familiar? The paradox of Roots music and Leftist politics, in the 1930's, both together in the Popular Front. <br /> <br />Moreover, it is perhaps speculative, but nonetheless provocative,  to note that  Lead Belly's popularity took place in the wane of the Harlem Renaissance (and into the 1940's), and quite possibly signaled for white consumption a sign of (or the `return' of) a more racialized `authentic n*ggerness' inscribed in black bodies, in contrast to the earlier  \\"New Negro\\" and the later post-WWII racial agitators.  For future artists, like Muddy Waters, the legacy of transformation took more commercial, but similar sets of turns. As Waters grew in popularity, his music shifted from Mississippi delta through country inflection--from acoustic to electric, in an attempt to adopt to urban styles...and then pressure to go back again to his more \\"primitive\\" beginnings for sales purposes. From the influence of Lomax to the commercial propagation of Leonard Chess and Willie Dixon, Filene follows Waters through his career to see the larger effect of \\"roots\\" discourse upon him and perceptions of him. We get an especially big eyeful when Filene takes extra time out to analyze Willie Dixon's \\"Hoochie Coochie Man\\", just one of many popular songs invoking pagan, magical, feral and occult tropes to signify both danger and desire for the listening subject. Waters influence on the Rolling Stones and The Beatles is noted, and we begin to see how folk constructions of authenticity gain a larger influence in Rock and Roll, even as black artists in that genre fail to catch fire with white youth as strongly as later white rock musicians did--or as even strongly as white folk artists like Bob Dylan and Pete Seeger. <br /> <br />Later parts of the work demonstrate the emergence of folk institutionalism in Washington, from the Federal Writers Project, the Resettlement Administration, and the Library of Congress all contributing to this effort within the framework of New Deal politics, and the growing idea that folklore always has a functional element to play in a given society. Rather then \\"vestigial,\\" folklore becomes \\"germinal.\\" The search for musical folklore takes these institutions to the city for perhaps the first time in \\"roots\\" discourse. And also to war, as government agencies came under increasing pressure to turn all aspects of policy towards the effort in WWII. At the same time, a push to professionalize folklore in academia gained ground as well--graduate programs in folklore were established, thus created a contentious political history for every field of culture impacted by contemporary folklore studies, no less than in American Studies. Richard M. Dorson, an early Americanist, was also an early \\"Folklore\\" specialist, and worked tirelessly to construct methodologies for subsequent use. Lomax, too, became an academic--an early methodologist in 1960's ethnomusicology. And with the establishment of Folklore in the Academy of Letters, the annual Folk Festival  is born, largely again, through the aegis of the Smithsonian---yet another example of government sponsorship and cultivation of Kulturvolk as national basis, continuing to the present day. The modern day so-called \\"folk revival\\" is born as well through the efforts of Pete Seeger, who carried on the functionalist tradition of the Lomaxes in his efforts. Folk cultures have literally become American cultures--in the sense that they may even suck all the air out of that category, leaving little for other than these constructed myths. <br /> <br /> <br />I appreciate the way that Filene goes about his project, using a combination of comparative visual analysis of photographs, and album covers, as well as musical and lyrical analysis. His willingness to take into account close readings of song collections (like 'American Ballads', 'Our Singing Country', and 'American Songbag'), and productions of early government/corporate partnerships in radio programming (such as \\"We Hold These Truths\\") speak to the power of his interdisciplinary method. And in uncovering more than just two periods of attention to folk music (the 1930s and the 1960s) he demonstrates a longer, more resilient undercurrent of American modernity and its self-renewal.	2004-10-15
US	52382660	R1GDRNJUZKF9CD	082232721X	69143517	Blue Nippon: Authenticating Jazz in Japan	Books	4	14	17	N	N	Can't give 3 and a half, so it gets 4 stars	E. Taylor Atkins, in his study of the ongoing efforts within Japanese culture to practice  original, yet `authentic' Japanese jazz musicianship, provides one of the most cogent analyses we've seen of the authenticity problem in Cultural Studies  and American Studies. <br /> <br />   It may seem on odd place to start, since its very subject seems `foreign' to American identity. But it is precisely this documented obsession with an ostensibly American nationalist (or ethnonationalist) cultural process in the midst of Japanese exceptionalism that provides such as rich vantage point for looking at issues of cultural nationalism.  <br /> <br /> Having undergone two periods of `modernization,' [the `opening' of Japan by Commodore Perry, and the post-WWII occupation period] at the hands of Western economic and political powers,  the sets of signifiers and cultural accretions onto jazz culture within Japan provide a unique place from which to view constructions of \\"American\\"ness, especially those that prize \\"creativity\\" and \\"originality.\\" As jazz remains a hotly contested item in the United States (claims to its ownership and origins often revolve around race) this is no less true that for ideologies in Japanese culture, such as the Nihonjinron popular and academic literature of the 1970s and 1980s which promoted the idea of the proprietary uniqueness of Japan and the \\"Japanese\\" way. <br /> <br /> Other cultural critics have tried to reductively analyze Japanese jazz and/or culture the same way (noting the influence of some \\"Zen\\" or \\"Space\\" aesthetic or some such thing) and ignoring other representations of those same aesthetics in other cultures. As Atkins asks--didn't Thelonious Monk in \\"Misterioso\\" or Miles Davis in \\"In A Silent Way\\" have a sense of \\"space\\" (not to mention Sun Ra. Just as in the United States--In Japan and Europe the term jazz simply has not functioned as a stable center of musicological meaning, at least not in the sense of necessary and sufficient criteria, but takes its place along with Hogaku, Gagaku, Shomyo, No, and Kabuki theater music, as inevitably being one thread contributing to and being influenced by cultural turns.  <br /> <br />Japanese jazz, at least in its early period, favored and incorporated a wide variety of influences, including both vibraphones and slack-key guitars, and was impacted by economic pragmatics--such as the fact that dance hall musicians were paid by the song rather than by the time--so short songs were encouraged and the development of longer improvisations discouraged. Of course, other institutions, such as the jazz coffeehouse (jazu kissa) flourished as well, though these specialized in recorded music over live muscians. <br /> <br /> Atkins tackles the racist notion of a \\"nation of imitators\\" head on. Of course, educational and cultural history in Japan has often placed more favor on the group or school or typology rather than the individual. This happens for a wide variety of reasons--but it is precisely that history that needs to be articulated in a critique to flesh out genuine differences-- rather than using them glibly and reductively, throwing words about like kata and iemoto. <br /> <br /> Moreover, Atkins makes clear that as in the United States, jazz in its early Japanese period was often associated with  marginal cultural and moral elements relative to the elite of Japanese society at the time. With the rise of an urban middle class in the 1910's and the rise first of Osaka, and then China's Shanghai entertainment culture, jazz became increasingly inseparable from social dancing and other activities, at the same time that educational reforms made access to `traditional' Japanese art music more remote. Into the 1920's Japan had a vibrant Jazz Age culture, whose music was a part of imported American products, like any other. Jazz became a volatile subject between  \\"cosmopolitan\\" and \\"nativist\\" impulses.  <br /> <br />Identified with U.S. and 'decadent' culture, jazz undergoes repression and then co-optation by the Imperial regime, especially during the rise of the State Shinto movement, even as U.S. martial forms of music had been adopted for training and indoctrination during the Meiji period. More specifically, American jazz undergoes repression, and then Japanese jazz, constructed to fit the pan-Asian imperial ideology of the government and intended to \\"spiritually mobilize\\" the population, gains in ascendency. American jazz became known as the \\"decadent drug,\\" and jazz coffeehouses were raided--dance halls closed. <br /> <br /> Over the mid-part of the century, transforming the music of the \\"enemy\\" into the \\"Japanese Jazz\\" movement involved moving away from \\"disavowal\\" to reassertion of nationalist identity, yet always in contradistinction to American identity. No doubt this is tied to the waves of Americanization that flooded Japan after its WWII defeat. Solidiers came to occupy much of Japan, and Japanese authors, scholars, and musicians too wrestled with both national or indigenous images of shame, defeat and disavowal (from Japan's loss and atrocities committed in the name of its Imperial ambitions) and cultural pollution from both the effects of the American occupation and the impossibility of excising or eradicating Japan's own Imperial past from its history. The rise of Decadence, both as philosophy (Sakaguchi Ango) and as practice for \\"promiscuous youth tribes\\" (zoku) and authors (like Dazai Osamu) served to hail the outcast as hero against the conservative state, and jazz went hand in hand with that image. Of course, interestingly enough, a similar thing happened at the same time in the United States with the Beat movement and the images that went with it. As often is the case, the mutability of jazz meant it turned again. Soon Japanese national programmers seemed to think jazz could help democratize Japan, or at least satisfy the objectives of the American occupiers. In the United States, jazz had always been deployed and exported as a symbol and testament to American democracy--increasingly so during the Cold War. By all accounts Japan experienced another Jazz (and Dancing) boom as its entertainment industry and middle class recovered from the war in the 1950's, even as 'serious' cultural critics grew uncomfortable with the raucous youth culture it continued to generate. Improvisation and extended bebopping was now part of the game in concert halls. But again this all fell apart with economic changes in the 1960's, and Jazz moved into another new period of authenticity searching as avant-garde movements of the 1970s looked back at previous Japanese musical forms (like Hogaku) to transform.  <br /> <br />   Even from the earliest days, tendencies in the U.S. to see jazz as subcultural to African-American identity were undermined by a more powerful identification with  American nationalism. Seeing themselves as outsiders, Atkins argues that Japanese jazz musicians and affectionadoes' collective obsession with \\"American\\"ness and \\"Japanese-ness\\" has formed a discursive center  from which other facets of jazz culture identify with or react to, rather than disregard completely. In this way, for Atkins an imagined American modernist stability has functioned as a discursive pivot point (or a accreted core) for the reassertion and maintenance of Japanese exceptionalism, which places itself at the center of a \\"Japanese\\" worldview, and holding \\"American\\"ness at  the margin.  <br /> <br />This is true even for the \\"Japanese Jazz\\" movement,  which according to Atkins attempts and fails to successfully articulate jazz in terms of historical Japanese aesthetics, such as the concepts of \\"mu,\\" \\"yugen\\" or \\"mono no aware.\\" The dialectical paradox of ideological core and periphery is a common theme today in discussing nationalisms, and \\"Japanese Jazz\\" is no different. In the end, Atkins is convinced that this separation and definition in terms of difference has always led to a undercurent of sensed failure--or \\"inauthenticity\\" on the part of Japanese Jazz. Yet at times he is swallowed up in the very discourses he critiques. In discussing the 1970's movements, he refers to one musician's (Togashi Masahiko) use of Hogaku as \\"pillaging\\" and another's (Akiyoshi Toshiko) use of space and minimal instrumentation as \\"Orientalist.\\" These terms and concepts detract from Atkins's work. His contention that \\"Japanese Jazz\\" is an artificial chimera echoes among so many he examines that its quite difficult to hear if alternative readings are available, or whether Atkins' own work suffers from a teleology that all Japanese Jazz is somehow 'doomed' to fail. There is much valuable material here--and we shouldn't discount that. Its just that, along with so many other books on Jazz (and indeed music in general) ---- the most trustworthy history and credible analysis comes early on, and author seems to grow more myopic as the book progresses. <br /> <br />Should be read along with John Dower's \\"Embracing Defeat,\\" also available on Amazon.com	2004-10-13
US	52382660	R1TSCJ7SNH649B	0520220846	226864946	Western Music and Its Others: Difference, Representation, and Appropriation in Music	Books	3	13	13	N	N	Impressive, but Frustrating as well.	Georgina Born and David Hesmondhalgh have edited an impressive volume, \\"Western Music and its Others: Difference, Representation, and Appropriation in Music.\\" Distinguished by its multipart and very dense Introduction, the work seeks to serve as a literature review and signpost for those interested in sources and hidden centers in both western art and popular music.  <br /> <br />The volume's essays, including many by long-standing cultural music scholars such as Richard Middleton, Simon Frith, and Philip Bohlman, seek several main goals. First, to apply portions of Orientatlist and Postcolonial theory to art and popular musics, seeking to identify in the traditions the twin poles of how Western ideology has traditionally sought the \\"Other\\"---as Same (assimilation), or as absolute Difference (projection). To this end a historical approach is used by several contributors. Second, to examine points of rupture, such as between subaltern musics, Western Modernist Art Music  (like Schoenberg) and Experimental music (such as John Cage) for ways in which autonomy and difference from each other's traditions was demonstrated and non-Western music's role to that end. Third, this volumes seeks to at least temporarily collapse the distinction between Art and Popular music, so that questions about representation can be asked with regard to how both these music treat each other and other Others with regard to issues such as essentialisms, nationalisms, and race, within a global capitalist context. <br /> <br />While essays on the art music tradition were helpful, I found that Middleton, Frith, and John Corbett's essays to be of the most important, so I'll spend most of my time there. Middleton is concerned with combining postcolonial critiques of assimilating and projecting the Other with a psychoanalytic cultural role for the Imaginary (the realm of repressed forbidden denied desires). At the same time, he identifies two strategies of resistance -- subaltern musics showing mastery of form by signifying of projections, and also deformation of mastery by constructing alien spaces against assimilation. <br /> <br />Bartok, Mozart, musical blackface in Gershwin's \\"Porgy and Bess,\\" and others undergo this treatment. Even projections like Duke Ellington's 1929 \\"Japanese Dream,\\" \\"Arabian Lover,\\" and his \\"jungle-band\\" tongue-in -cheek work \\"Diga-Diga-Doo\\"  at Harlem's Cotton Club are analyzed. Middleton then brings in African-American literary theory to point out how black artists such as Ellington and Ladysmith Black Mambazo take these representations of the Other and Signify on them for their own uses and agendas. Moreover, he notes Abraham Ibrahim (Dollar Brand) 's work which uses South African popular styles and European musical cliches to construct a space of multivalent open-endedness out of European closure. In this way. Middleton contends that while music can never authentically belong to us (it resists a final interpretation) we can make ourselves at home in it through these sorts of processes. <br /> <br />John Corbett's contribution misses not a beat, recognizing that Orientalist forms have long since been reappropriated and redeployed again and again. Seeking some underdetermined sense of how this has operated in the Experimental Music tradition, Corbett focuses on John Cage, who in his mind began with an inventive, scientific, and indeterminate approach, seeking to free sounds from socio-political concerns. Not sure I buy this interpretation, especially when the \\"irrationalist\\" Cage, by Corbett's own admission, and widely held knowledge, read freely among Buddhist and Indian philosophies, the contemporary Esotericism of Aldous Huxley's \\"The Perennial Philosophy,\\" the nature writings of Thoreau and the anti-modernist works of Duchamp.  When Corbett morphs this experimentation into a explorationist, conquering colonialist trope, he may be right--but it is more due to the study of Zen koans rather than any methodological scientific functionalism.  While notable for its scope. Corbett is sometimes caught in the authenticity game he accuses others of playing--as when he approves of using \\"world musics\\" as inspiration for an artist to make \\"his own music.\\"  <br /> <br />Thankfully he sees that Cage used Other musics to disrupt Western musical preoccupations, more than for their \\"exotic\\" appeal, as did Steve Reich and others who sought inspiration rather than imitation. When Corbett tackles Brian Eno and Jon Hassell, he is more successful in framing the power politics of Jon Hassell's utopian Fourth World, an imaginary space where musics can freely intermix and national boundaries dissolve. For Corbett Hassell and Eno are merely imitators. His attempt to deconstruct Eno and Byrne's \\"My Life in the Bush of Ghosts\\", however is a failure, as the record's direct quotation of recorded sources approaches Signification rather then Orientalist exoticism. Corbett is reductive, attempting to place the \\"exotic... echoey\\" someplace. Except that isn't particularly sounding like anyplace else or any combination thereof, certainly not an \\"Oriental\\" space in the Edward Said sense.  <br /> <br />If you can't trace where the Orientalism is from, then you should start to at least suspect that it actually might not be there. Otherwise, your interpretive analysis sounds like little more than an article of faith. And that really is the key here. Corbett, as an article of faith, is unmovably pessimistic about the possibility of any cross-cultural inquiry under any circumstances, as opposed to say works of 'surreal anthropology,' as well as Victor Turner, James Clifford, George Marcus, and David Toop. By the time he gets to John Zorn, who actively supports and finances the release of indigenous musics, he's lost his steam. By taking liner notes out of context and holding Zorn and New Albion Records to a standard of unrealistic verbal expression in order to avoid the charge of Orientalism--well, its just not credible any longer.  <br /> <br />David Hesmondhalgh's essay explores the politics of appropriating sections of indigenous sounds as backing vocals and possible unity chants for foregrounded Western vocals, along with dance pulses, tabla-playing, and other elements of transglobal dance hall music. Hesmondhalgh correctly recognizes that the \\"world music\\" wave of the 80's was derided in the music press for its concern with \\"authenticity,\\" but suggests that the same politics are at work in music that deliberately cultivates playful pastiche in the 90's as well. Hesmondhalgh is not the first to take sampling by artists such as Peter Gabriel to task for musical \\"borrowings\\" (Timothy Taylor, in particular, devotes extensive time to it). Nor is he the only one to point out the ethical problems that arise when artists sampled are not or cannot be paid. But he is notable for ethically accepting the role of live musicians to be used in recordings, rather than samples. Some have argued that any representation of \\"ethnic\\" music, even when credited and paid for, is still something of a postcolonial crime--the prime example being Paul Simon and his albums Graceland and Rhythm of the Saints. Yet at the same time Hesmondhalgh questions the notion of racial ownership, even via the shared experience of hegemony. So its unclear that any use or ground would be legitimate. D.H. just isn't consistent on this issue of whether musical hybridity is morally justifiable or not. <br /> <br />Frith's contribution (along with Middleton's) is the most satisfying one--as he unpacks the myth of \\"World Music\\" marketing in the late 1980's and 1990's-which was inextricably wound with concerns over marketing, commericial appeal, and perhaps most of all, authenticity. In fact, the recruitment of ethnomusicologists as field researchers and respondants for World music field guides placed the question of agency, gatekeeping, and cultural imperialism at the very center of the category. But the question runs both ways, as indigenous musicians appropriated Western musics for their own agency and power as well. This hybridity, for Frith, is the sound of the \\"Global Postmodern,\\" with internal contradictions, power struggles, and politics in every direction, from accomodation to resistance to appropriation. Even as the boundaries of West and not-West are reproduced and maintained though, the question of authenticity remains. Are \\"world musicians\\" the only ones capable of playing these musics authentically (as Timothy Taylor maintains), or does that too simply reproduce the Other as absolute difference between \\"authentic\\" and \\"inauthentic\\"?	2004-10-13

Many associate it with a sound object of some kind, but as many have pointed out, the perceptual filters and hermeneutic webs wound into the reception of sound objects have brought many, especially in the cultural studies tradition, to conclude that no separation between the two is possible, necessary, or even desirable. The most straightforward example of this conception of music among these authors can be found within \\"Development Arrested.\\" While the word \\"blues\\" is often used to describe a genre of music historically originating in African-American communities, or a label applied to the collective identity of African-Americans (\\"Blues People\\") Woods instead contends that Blues is best understood as  a way of understand the collective and accumulated historical consciousness and responses to continuing economic and political exploitation. Incorporating the optimistic aesthetic arguments of Albert Murray (Stomping the Blues), Woods finds a dialectic of both critique and affirmation in the blues. In doing so, Woods wishes to bridge the gap separating the blues as an aesthetic form and the blues as a theory of socio-economic development. Primarily Woods seeks this bridge in drawing new types of boundaries around blues discourse. <br /> <br /> <br />This `Blues Epistemology' (B.E.) is a lens of viewing and understanding the world that can take the form of a deliberately constructed sound object, or a book on the legacy of plantation power in the Delta. This epistemology has, according to Woods, several major distinguishing features. It is oppositional, concerned with social relations, socially realistic in its analysis, and demystifying. In addition, cultural productions of this epistemology are affirmative, and confessional, class-based, and enact/maintain an imagined community among African-Americans. In Woods' specific case, he uses B.E. to write a history of power relations in the Delta from the Plantation Revolution from inception to present-day.  <br /> <br />`Sound objects' are powerful product and exemplars of this epistemology, but only one of its many modes of expression. For as ephemeral and marginalized groups come into and out of daily life, their ideas, once embedded in their lives, are now embedded in their cultural production, live on. For example, Woods specifically links the Delta Blues to a working-class consciousness that seeks genuine participatory democracy.  This African-American working class then becomes a major factor in the creation of African-American studies, which should be seen as reproducing this structure of understanding. Overall, what is central to understanding Woods' conception of the \\"Blues\\" is that it seeks to uncover (or recover) the organic connection between the lived experience of African-Americans and their intellectual production. At the same time, it challenges and defies a Euro-American understanding of `history' and `hermeneutic' as separate entities, and argues forcefully for `re-membering' each as part of the other.  <br /> <br /> <br />This then becomes the basis for re-reading the history of slavery and underdevelopment. Using Marx's critique of chattel slavery and Eric Williams \\"Capitalism and Slavery,\\" Woods finds that the blues (understood widely) develop their staunch oppositionality out of the need to resist the totalizing structures of white plantation owners after slave trade ended in the early 1800's. As local economic structures during reconstruction first failed to develop along different social patterns (the gang system was still used on some sharecropping areas) than before, this contributed to the ongoing concern with social realism. African-Americans took the situation into their own hands, with strikes, rights demanded, and attempts to reintroduce the Black Codes failed. For Woods, the Delta was the post-war center of African-American political thought, it became necessary for white institutions to, ove the next 100 years, portray its Black residents as \\"passive, criminal, and ignorant.\\" When of course, nothing could be further from the truth.  <br /> <br />Still, massive violence and its symbolic equvalents, such as the Lost Cause, were deployed to disenfranchise black Americans, such as in the election of 1875, and during the subsequent years of Mississippi as a one-party Democratic state. At the same time, the blues (the name of which Woods traces to the Southern fear of black men in Union military garb--\\"The Black and Blues\\") gains its ascension. Even through planter-dominated Roosevelt's Agricultural Adjustment Act of the 1930's and the Enclosure movement, Big Bill Broonzy, Federal eugenics and sterilization, and Gunnar Myrdal's liberal racism of the 1940's. Woods includes excellent pictures and captions linking Blues epistemology with Black survival and resistance in the South. In addition, his analysis includes the role of the Blues music and Blues ideology in the 1950's and 1960's civil rights movement, with emphasis on Junior Wells and Muddy  Waters, but noting the growth of such artists as Junior Kimbrough, and R.L.  Burnside. Woods finishes by focusing on other moments of resistance and autonomy in the Delta, including the Tunica incident in 1985  and the Delta Pride strike of 1990, with a scathing point by point condemnation of the Lower Mississippi Delta Development Commission, and the work done under its then-chairman Bill Clinton. <br /> <br />Woods' book is an ambitious work of regional history in American Studies--told through the interpretive framework of  Blues epistemology. It is a detailed blow by blow account of the local history in terms of race and economic underdevelopment, valorizing indigenous wisdom from a left populist perspective, and making the case that racism is a *structure*--not a failure to dispel lower-class fear (as the liberals would have it) or a failure to adhere to indivdualist ethics (as conservatives would have it. Instead racism is exposed asthe deep structure of a slavery that existed originally to make class (as in Eric William's \\"Capitalism and Slavery\\"), but ended up making race in the process (Berlin's \\"Many Thousands Gone\\"), and continues to this day through the systematic and planned reproduction of oppression and inequality, secured in part, \\"by ethnic warfare.\\"	2004-10-12

Moreover, the term \\"music\\" is not held in hegemonic circles to be just *any* product of a process, but rather the product of the process of producing what is known as Western classical music. This music is today commonly perceived as being absolute or autonomous--self-contained, and when performed is performed only in the sense that the performance is judged against an abstract perfected Platonic-like form of the work in question. All performances, are therefore, approximations only of some ur-essence of the piece. The essence of the work (if such can be said to exist) in this paradigm lies in the notated score, which has assumed an inviolate sacredness since the 19th century unknown to previous paradigms (or other current ones) of musicking. <br /> <br />But Small, as I said, wishes to challenge this. What we need, instead, says Small--is to resort to the verb -\\"to music.\\" To music is to take part, in any capacity, in a musical performance, whether by performing, listening, by rehearsing, or practicing, by providing material for performance (what is commonly called composition), or by dancing. This is true for active participation or passive participation, and Small means it in a descriptive, not prescriptive sense. To take part, is for Small, the important aspect over all--for it refers to the forging of relationships. <br /> <br />Small discusses at length the structure and evolution of modern spaces in which Western classical music is musicked. As the repertory has fossilized, modern orchestras have doubled since WWII. These spaces are built, especially in developing countries and growing metropolitian areas, as signals that these communities have reached a certain threshold of intellectual and cultural \\"development.\\" Not only do these buildings rise as a sign of certain attitudes and assumptions about the world, they enforce those codes for others in the community---that classical music is a sui generis cultural form in its own right. Also, these halls typically enforce a kind of continuity with European past, particularly Renaissance or Ancient past. Not too many Gothic music halls.  <br /> <br />Typically the space has a portion devoted to purchasing tickets (permission to enter this space) and to pick up tickets already purchased--which is the preferred entrance method culturally. There are at least two spaces inside--one smaller one designed for standing and talking, seeing and being seen. The other is very large, opulent, and designed for individual ceremonial seating--to inspire a sense of grandeur. Concert hall seating is designed to inscribe a one-way enclosed directional flow of value, rather than a reciprocal or multivalent direction, as in other forms of musicking. There are no outside windows in a Concert Hall.  This is certainly different than in previous centuries, where this music would be played as part of a lively social scene which included many other facets. <br /> <br />Here in this new Concert space, the past is visited always in terms of the present. Rather than the historical past, we visit a mythical, idealized past through concert ritual---Small refers to it as a \\"theme park\\" made safe through canonization of works, bits and pieces of biography, and smug, safe distance. <br /> <br />One of the most significant contributions Small brings to the musicking table is his discussion of the anthropologist Gregory Bateson's philosophy of mind. In a refutation of Cartesian dualism, Bateson postulates that in their ability to respond and adjust to information received from their environment, all organisms have the property of mind. Thus, wherever there are patterns of matter called life, there is mind. In giving and responding to information, organisms shape their environments and each other, just as they are shaped by their environment and each other. These exchangesof information and respsonse creates a network of relationships that all activties of life and its environment are embedded in. Knowledge constitutes a relationship between knower and known--certainly interwoven with both context and content in these relationships. Thus, to try to gain knowledge of all things would to try to forge a priviledged position with respect to all things--domination. <br /> <br />These relationships are mediated by language, according to Small and Bateson--but it usually a language of gesture, rather than of words. Gestures are multivalent, complex, and often contradictory forms of communication, all at once. But in communicating gestures, the end parties of the relationship (relata) are not named--they are taken for granted. Thus what is gestured is the relation itself--an \\"affirmative\\" and \\"here-and-now\\" form of communication. Gestures are iconic, and yet still reflect a choice of representations. Drawing on the work of American philosopher Mark Johnson--Small elucidates Bateson's gestural language in terms of what Johnson calls 'metaphorical thinking.\\"----and what Small winds up with ultimately is a somatic theory of knowledge--a bodily epistemology, if you will. <br /> <br />Thus, music we like makes us feel good in that it enacts relationships we belong in. We may also feel bad if we sense the illusory nature of those relationships. We may feel distant or upset if the relationships evoked are not what's \\"really going on\\" or are not ones we fit or belong in. But the experience of the relationship belongs more to the world of gestural paralanguage, rather then discursive verbalness. So words cannot fully express it. But nor is it simply emotive. <br /> <br />According to Small, there is no such thing as \\"absolute music\\"--musical works that exist solely to be contemplated aesthetically and abstractly. To take part is a musical work, either as performer, listerner, or janitor, is to take part in a dramatic representation of personal relationships, which is no less real for having numbers for a title or not having a written libretto. The distinction between music and that evoked by the music -\\"extra-musical\\" is thus collapsed--dramatic meanings taken from the piece are part of the musical meaning of the musicking. <br /> <br />The brilliance of this book lies in its use of the philosophy of somatic and ritual knowledge as productivity, and an willingness to untangle the sociocultural threads that enmesh any musical performance. This rightly deemphasizes musical emotivism and formalism, and allows us instead to examine the cultural phenomenology that is at work in any act(s) of musicking. However, the connections between emotion and gesture  in the book are less than fully elaborated, and without that it is difficult to know precisely how to handle the emotions that are evoked in musicking, and so attempting to structure the relationships between emotions and bodily knowledge becomes confusing.	2004-10-07

There is a lot to say about \\"Performing Rites,\\" or rather there is a lot to say about the many different trajectories cameoed as this book progresses. It is a work that deliberately seeks to question rather than to answer, offering provocatively fertile and arguable points rather than a systemic totalizing argument.<br /><br />Keeping this in mind, the basic question Frith seeks out is: \\"Well, we know we make value judgments about popular music all the time. How and Why are these made?\\"<br /><br />That's a tall order. And Frith seeks to start from the listener's \\"common sense\\"  perspective, but also incorporates production as well. Of course the first problem is the notion of \\"value\\" in cultural studies--where words like \\"good\\" and \\"bad\\" are either spoken from a condescending sneer, highly interrogated, or avoided altogether. Rather than seeing value for music in its \\"popularity,\\" Frith contends that music is always  already deeply woven into schemes of value--and that's why it becomes both popular and inherently political. Music has authors, intentions, narratives, and these cannot be separated from questions of value. Challenging capitalistic market measures of measuring both popularity and value (such as Billboard), Frith takes a cue from Kant, seeking to discover and refine the logic in 'common-sense' responses to music--from genre rules, to poltical distinctions between noise and sound. Frith treats rhythm at length, and challenges the notion that rhythm is 'inherently' tied to erotics, seeking instead historical and postcolonial explanations for this.<br /><br />Along the way, Frith demonstrates that much of the ninetheenth century cultural judgments and ideologies about music are still with us, albeit in mutated form. Folk, Art, and Pop are Frith's interwoven discourses about how music is perceived in Western Culture. \\"Folk\\" promises tradition, immediacy, and a critique of commercialism. \\"Art\\" promises mental and cultural transcendence. \\"Pop\\" promises access and portability. Songs are not mere texts or poetry--music gives sense and a frame for lyrics. Technology, Performance, and their meeting in the Microphoned Amplified Vocalists all play roles. Technology not only disseminates, but inseminates. Digital recordings and remasters do not uncover \\"the original object,\\" but instead construct a new sound object according to changing cultural codes about music.  Pop Performance involves constructing an image that gives the impression of truth and sincerity, but also offering seduction and danger as a lure. Vocalists DO play an instrument-- a microphone as well as a voice, and this alone has an enourmous impact on the meanings of music.<br /><br />All this leads Frith to argue that for the 'meaning of music.' Music means something because it offers not argumentation, but experience. For Frith, music constructs a \\"sense of identity\\" through the experiences it offers of time, sociability, and the body. Music makes possible a new-kind of self-recognition--one that through all these historical discourses places us in different 'imagined' (but no less real) communities, coherent cultural narratives. This \\"fusion\\" as Frith calls it, of bodily practice and imaginative fantasy--is the integration of aesthetics and ethics:<br /><br />From: \\"This sounds good.\\"<br /><br />To: \\"This is good.\\"<br /><br />That this all sounds very religious--a \\"fusion\\" of bodily ritual practice, and imaginative phantasy---should not be lost on the reader.

Two elements emerge early:  the growth of a 'orthodox' socialism in the arts and music, and a concern over the authenticity of Brasilian cultural production both for internal consumption and external export. Musically, this concern with authenticity focused on the dual phenomena of Carmen Miranda, and Bossa Nova, both of which carry either heavy non-Brazilian influences and uncomfortable racial stereotypes. <br /> <br />Meanwhile, the progressive impulse is subverted in a right-wing military coup (supported and encouraged by the United States) which profoundly affects the Brazilian arts and the public. Television and Opera maintain a certain degree of freedom from censorship at first, but revolutionary socialism seems unable to articulate an effective resistance. <br /> <br />Enter Caetano Veloso and Gilberto Gil. In this matrix of poltical and nationalistic uncertainty, and through the use of pastiche, dissassociative imagery, irony, parody, and a concern with the everyday frustrations of Brazilians, they  construct an insurgent music that gains a wide reach and audience, while mostly flying underneath the dictatorship's radar screen. Refusing the government's attempts to force a highly nationalistic concept of unity on the populace, Tropicalia uses deploys the benign imagery of tropical paradise, only to subvert them with references (sometimes overt, sometimes oblique by necessity) to social and political trauma. The more orthodox leftists, of course, criticize Tropicalia for not directly inciting the masses to act, and instead promoting escapism. Yet Tropicalia's moment in the sun is not only threaded in the past of Brazilian historical discourse on modernity, but serves to feed a growing countercultural movement in Brazilian culture throughout the late 1960s and 1970's. By foregrounding areas of Brazilian socio-economic underdevelopment, Afro-Brazilian religion (Macumba, Candomble), and the historical legacy of Portugese colonialism, Tropicalia stakes out a lasting ground, and a usable past for  Brazilian counterculture.  <br /> <br />The book is heavy on history,  and light on the explicit citation of theory, although its playful and trickster hermeneutic (well suited to its subject matter) is everywhere. Also playing a prominant role in the book is Candomble. Candomble religion plays an imporant role in the history of Tropicalia, and in the larger history of Brazilian metaphor and music. Candomble practices and practitioners occur in artistic discourses concerning the nature and center of Brazilian modernismo. Such as the 1971 painting \\"Primeria missa no Brasili\\" by Glauco Rodrigues, the song \\"Batmacumba\\" on \\"Tropicalia , ou panis et circensis\\" and on Os Mutandes first recording , Veloso's \\"Triste Bahia,\\" a 1970's pop revival with roots as early as the 1930's. but especially prescient with Gil Gilberto and Veloso, and Gal Costa's tour of \\"Doces Barbaros\\" in 1976. 1977 saw Veloso's album \\"Bicho\\" and Gilberto Gil's \\"Refavela,\\" both intimately concerned with Black consciousness and Candomble. Even as 1997 Gil's album \\"Quanta\\" wove discourses of the Internet with Orisha worship. <br /> <br />A dense book that weaves from literary and painting analysis to economic development theory and musical hermeneutics--this is a carefully written and edited interdisciplinary work of Cultural History and American/Atlantic Studies. <br /> <br />The author recommends the CD \\"Tropicalia Essentials\\" for use with the book. It is available on Amazon.com  <br /> <br />After reading the book , I would also suggest \\"Tropicalia, ou panis et circensis\\" -- the original release of which appears to have been a crystalizing moment in the Tropicalia movement.	2004-09-16

Professor Suzanne E. Smith' project *Dancing in the Streets: Motown and the Cultural Politics of Detroit* is a well-written and fascinating work of revisionist, myth-busting history. For perhaps no other musical institution has been given such a large free pass for (mis)representing its founder's ideology as the company's actual history. <br /> <br />The story of Motown is usually told as the early story of Berry Gordy, a member of an Black entrepreneurial family who borrows $800 from his other family members and ends up the king of a musical empire, thus proving the Horatio Alger myth that anyone (even an African-American) with a little grit and determination can succeed in America. But such a story fails to account for much of the instituional, and ideological factors that made a specific type of entrepreneurial cultural production possible in Detroit, Michigan. Along with churches, temples, businesses, newspapers and activists, we are treated to a history of Motown that is deeply inscribed in an underclass familial net of relationships and social networks, given a boost by black media and a history of both jazz production and humanistic training for songwriters and musicians in the Detroit educational system. Not in the least, there was the automotive industry, which was both a source of Black humilation, frustation, and yet inspiration for adapting technologies and industrial processes of streamling and assembly-line production. Motown literally manufactured its artists using the same separate teams for songwriting, backup production, etiquette and image cultivation for all its artists. As the business grows the model remains, although soon Motown is a multi-million dollar international industry, and no longer a small paternalistically run family operation. <br /> <br />Throughout it all, Motown is given a both a special place in the Black community and a difficult role in attempting to market its product to a larger white (and mostly teenage) audience. Indebtedto the civil rights ideologies of Booker T. Washington and Carter G. Woodson, Motown maintains an ambivalent relationship with the fracturing civil rights movement and its divergent leaders and interests. As the tumultuousness of 1967 and 1968 come forth, the fissures at Motown erupt, as many artists demand a greater profit-sharing, and more creative control over their music and roles at the company. We see and follow the careers and songs of the Supremes, Little Stevie Wonder, Martha and the Vandellas, and well as The Miracles and Marvin Gaye. Smith builds a woven patchwork of cultural history and its emergent politics around several different themes, such as the rise and ultimate failure of Black capitalism to remain tied to its original community, the uses or Motown for the greater Detroit black community, and the role of other Motown among other institutions in ameliorating economic and political hardship for the Black community, both locally and nationally. We get to set not only the production side of Motown, but also the myriad ways that the music was inextricably interwoven and read into the lives of those who held it dear to Detroit' heart. <br /> <br />Methodologically, Smith does all this by using the theoretical perspective of Raymond Williams, who coined the concept \\"cultural formation.\\" In Williams' view, it is impossible to understand \\"an intellectual or artistic project without also understanding its formation.\\" Cultural formations are \\"simultaenously artistic forms and social locations.\\" The relationship dynamic between the two structures the formation that emerges as a result of the synergistic effects of the individual projects, agents, and institutions involved. Each functions as a distinct agent with its own agendas and motivations, constituting a complex mosiac of reactions, relationships, and tensions. This is particularly well suited to an analysis of Motown Records, precisely because of the culturally mythological status it has acheived---an American everyman's music. But even the deep seated agendas and motivations that gave birth to this acheivement of seemingly apolitical universalism are themselves deeply political and reflect political consequences of judgments. These judgments to aggresively pursue a project of Black capitalism modeled on the industrial production of the automotive industrial (\\"assembly line production\\" of hit songs) are the efforts of Detroit's most famous \\"cultural producer,\\" regardless of how the company may have attempted to steer clear of explicit poltical messages in its products as much as possible. <br /> <br />All in all, the book is a significant addition to recent scholarship.  In depth for the cultural historian and Motown fan, but very easy and user-friendly for the casual reader. The book has been criticized for its approach to Black capitalism, but Smith's perspective is in no way \\"naive.\\" Rather, it is solidly based in historical political economy of African-Amercan underdevelopment as discussed by Manning Marable, among others. Her criticism of Gordy is tempered, and is presently more as the inevitable consequence of becoming a large impersonal corporation that still uses paternalistic rhetoric towards its cultural workers and larger community while acting solely in its own self-interest. If Smith draws largely on black newspaper accounts, autobiography and insider media, it is not because she wishes to avoid \\"primary\\" sources, but is instead interested in drawing a picture of the relationships and interactions that emerge at the time among institutions as well as people--something not easily obtainable from interviews  and other types of so-called \\"primary sources\\" years later. Of course, the political and hermeneutic assumptions inherent in classifying some sources as primary and others as secondary are themselves sometimes suspect. But that is a discussion for another time and place.	2004-09-11
US	52382660	R3UKZS7C6N734V	0226534782	741181008	Saying Something: Jazz Improvisation and Interaction (Chicago Studies in Ethnomusicology)	Books	4	10	10	N	N	Trying to balance musicians, critics, and academics is tough	Ingrid Monson's volume, \\"Saying Something: Jazz Improvisation and Interaction\\" is a somewhat lesser known work following in the shadow of Paul Berliner, whom Monson pays ample tribute to. Her volume is intended to say something to all of its overlapping audiences, and it succeeds well, using interviews and close musical readings of very important pieces. There is much to say about the musical analyses, but I choose here to concentrate on the less formalistic aspects. That job will remain for another reviewer. <br /> <br />      Monson claims that when \\"a musician successfully reaches a discerning audience, moves it members to applaud or shout praises, raises the energy to dramatic proportions, and leaves a sonorous memory that lingers long after, he or she has moved beyond technical experiences....and into the realm of 'saying something.'\\" But what does this mean? For Monson, this means to make discourse, and multivalently, to make community. <br /> <br />      Monson moves towards thinking of music making as a community-building function, rather than communities organized by race, class, geography, or gender. In fact, those categories are attended to in terms of music, rather than the other way around. Music performance, and well as repetoire, promotion, and booking agents, create imagined communities between performers. Her approach to community-building is based in Anthony Giddens (1984) rather than Benedict Anderson (1991). <br /> <br />       In outlining the special contributions of the rhythmic and accompaniment sections of the jazz ensemble, Monson draws special attention not only to the specifics of drum, piano, and bass, but also to the word \\"listening.\\" For her, listening means \\"being able to respond to musical opportunities or to correct mistakes.\\" It is an active term. Musicians must pay attention to what is going on if they \\"expect to say things that make sense to the other participants.\\" Moreover, since improvisation is key to jazz performance, listening is a prerequisite for playing to the moment within a musical narrative. In the free play of conversation/improvisation, the discursive conditions may change spontaenously and unexpectedly from moment to moment, since no one person authors the narrative alone. In addition, to be told that one \\"doesn't listen\\" is a paramount challenge and insult in jazz performance. It means the performer isn't communicating with other performers, but ineptly (at best) or arrogantly (at worst) attempting to control the entire parameters of the discourse. Sociability and interaction is at the core of collective improvisation, and if it is denied, the conversation is foreclosed. <br /> <br />       But what of the statements themselves? How do jazz phrases and sentences work in what we might call improvisation/conversation? Monson takes a page from Bakhtin (1981), discussing the notion of internal dialogism, in two aspects: 1) multiple semantic meanings that change and are changed according to the shifting demands of the relationship between the meanings and the cultural context that makes meaning sensible. 2) the \\"temporal context\\" in which things are expressed in relation to the history of other discourses.  Statements are caught between two different forces of language (centripetal and centrifugal forces) Utterances are caught signifying towards the unitary center (centripetal) and away from it in their particularity (centrifugal). Thus each statement is a torn contradiction inside, and also most meaningful at the same time. A \\"tension-filled unity.\\" Others have race-d and extended this concept, such as African-American poet Elizabeth Alexander, who contend for a space that moves away from bifucated division and towards an space of \\"myriad particulars of identity.\\"(1992) Notice how compatible this dualistic tension formula is with W.E.B Dubois's notion of the African-American \\"double consciousness.\\" These racial aspects of hegemony in both in the history of jazz reception and inthe interactions of jazz musicians with others who talk about jazz and \\"music\\" are highlighted in Monson's work. <br /> <br />     When jazz musicians talk about music departments, they recognize that the words \\"music department\\" means \\"Western Classical Music department.\\" Western Classical form has been anointed at the recognized highest status, and therefore stands for (and crowding out) the space in which the term music has institutional meaning. So when jazz musicians request not to be pigeonholed by the term \\"jazz,\\" we must recognize that they are speaking to the cultural politics of labeling, or naming..of telling, and of listening. Musicians recognize Foucault's truth that 'discourses construct the objects of which they speak', rather than represent them in some naive, simplistic way. At the same time, Monson is careful not to overstate the case of cultural theory in explaining or explicating the 'meaning of music.' If we leave the realm of the musician too often or too long, we are no longer listening--no longer able to respond in the free play of conversation/improvisation.	2004-09-09

No exceptions here.	Davis work is a powerful re-reading of Blues women, and firmly places them in the center, rather than the margin, of Black oppositional and autonomous culture discourse. The book is mostly devoted to the work of Gertrude Rainey and Bessie Smith, but there are important sections devoted to Billie Holiday as well. In each case, the Davis argues for a more complete contextual understanding of Blues women music as introducing gender issues, breaking discursive taboos, and forging meaning within the context of an imagined community of Black women's lives. <br />   <br />To begin with, Davis convincingly argues that Blues women were on the vanguard in breaking down taboos concerning domestic violence and male subjugation, as many Blues songs concerned these matters. Davis uses powerful works such as \\"Rough and Tumble Blues,\\" \\"See See Rider Blues,\\" and \\"Send Me to the 'Lectric Chair,\\" to demonstrate that Blues women were willing to engage in oppositional, if allegorical, violence in the service of personal autonomy. Even man songs that seem to demonstrate acquiescence, even masochism, in the face of male abuse can be seen to have an ironic,  subversive, or didactic quality that belies a simplistic surface reading. <br />   <br /> Davis  also takes on the common notion that Blues music doesn't include social protest, an interpretation that has been pushed by white commentators, such as Samuel Charters, and black commentators, such as Albert Murray. Davis argues that Blues music inherits from Slave musical culture a coded approach to naming and resistance that demands more than a surface analysis of the lyrics, and takes into account the role of music as a lyrical interlocuter. Focusing on tunes such as \\"Backwater Blues\\" and \\"Washwoman's Blues,\\" Davis almost always effectively demonstrates that coded protest is still protest, and that women's blues historically anticipated and grounded mass movements in the areas of civil rights and feminism, while remaining linked with West African hermeneutic structure of naming and interpretation, such as \\"nommo.\\" <br />   <br /> In terms of Religious content, Davis forcefully recounts how women reconfigured a secular existential (or even \\"Devil's\\") music as prayer itself, magically and aesthetically conjured to exorcise emotions such as \\"the blues.\\" At the same time, she harshly criticizes the Black church for adopting Christian dualisms concerning the moral status of body and spirit, which she sees as sexualized forms of racism and sexism--- since both blacks and women have been semiotically linked with earthiness and body as opposed to spirit by while male elites. Celebratory Sexuality, on the other hand, has always, according to Davis, been an oppositional aspect of black working-class consciousness. This extends beyond sexuality to an affirmation of Black folk religious life (such as Hoodoo) and crossing of class boundaries in the Blues, which Davis contends is a major reason Blues music was ignored and even distanced by Black elites during the Harlem Renaissance.  <br />   <br /> Davis's discussion of Billie Holiday is short (two chapters) but powerful, in which she argues that Holiday subversively appropriated the saccharine Tin Pan Alley love song format she was given as Slaves would have appropriated the English language upon their arrival in the North Americas. Holiday worked little in the formal Blues, but was nontheless grounded in the Blues idiom, from which she drew inspiration, and a subversive presentation of white romantic life to Black audiences. In this vein, such songs as \\"Strange Fruit\\" fit more coherently, and the ironic (and yet utopian) edge in her voice professes to the truth of Black women's lives, even in ways that on the surface seem to be feministically regressive. <br />   <br /> There are isolated examples where Davis is less successful than at other times, but on the whole, her argumentation is strong and fearless, and her analogical and narrative analysis of the music along with lyrics adds, rather than detracts, from her argument.	2004-08-19
US	52382660	RNEXK41K44QRW	0306803623	99335308	Stomping The Blues (Da Capo Paperback)	Books	4	1	1	N	N	Blues music as Ecstatic Pagan Affirmation and Incantation	Albert Murray's \\"Stomping the Blues\\" is not an organized book in some kind of European sonata-style way, but rather much like what it talks about--a Blues tune.  Beginning with a word \\"vamp\\" and ending with an outbreak, in between are a series of analytical riffs of the nature and function of the Blues Music disguised as chapters. Murray's riffs are connected by periodic restated themes, one of which is that Blues music is not essentially melancholy or depressing at all. Rather, Blues music is best defined as music that arises to \\"stomp\\" and beat away the blues with rituals of purification, ecstasy, and celebration. So for Murray, the music most might call Jazz is simply one more version of Blues music. Even when the lyrics are down, the music is often intended to highlight irony and audience participation (instead of commiseration). The dominant metaphor for Blues music in this book is a kind of 'ecstatic pagan incantation'--one that brings one of the important existential secrets of responding to difficulty and tragedy in life. As the Black Church brings it own mix of solemnity and reverence to African-American life, so Blues Music responds with its dialectical opposite. And since Blues and Jazz musicians were raised in the Church to begin with, there remains a link, however, tense, between the two spaces of life. <br /> <br />Along the way, Murray argues that Blues instrumentation is much more important than lyric content, that ecstatic incantations of talking drums can't be properly understood in European musicological formalism, and that Blues music is distinctly African-American, and in many ways European, than anything African. Its \\"Afro-U.S.\\" he calls it. Blues music is, like lyric poetry, more concerned with the personal than the political, more concerned with contrived stylistic mastery than raw emotional output, and more concerned with the aesthetic heroism of adaptive, innovative geniuses than folkart  conservatism. Yes, he's harsh with white liberal critics. He's still grudging over the way that white media crowned Paul Whiteman,  Bix Beiderbecke, and Benny Goodman--- over Duke Ellington and Count Basie. And he wants to at once claim the centrality of African-American experience and cultural contours to understanding the music, much like Amiri Baraka's famous \\"Jazz and the White Critic\\" article. Murray struggles with the same issues jazz and blues historians for years have struggled with--how to understand conservatism and innovation in art, where to place hierarchies such as \\"folk art\\" and \\"fine art,\\" and how recently to take discussions of Blues music. At times he is less successful than others in this way. But to read this book is to understand one of the ideological underpinnings to the new conservatism of the Lincoln Center project, and that is vitally important for all students of cultural history. To dismiss it as \\"racist\\" is to misunderstand the cultural context Murray is writing from, and to overstate the absence of Anthony Braxton, as well as the cursory treatments of Ornette Coleman and Miles Davis is to give short shrift to a text published in 1976, when these musicians were still very much in flux.	2004-08-13
US	52382660	RF5Y5QYVJFLEV	0520225414	789877970	Interpreting Popular Music	Books	4	4	5	N	N	Brilliant, Eclectic. Rigorous, and Open-Ended.	David Brackett's \\"Interpreting Popular Music\\" is a very valuable addition to the field of popular music scholarship. It self-consciously avoids a general theory of popular music scholarship, but rather makes the case that a wide variety of individual approaches, best tailored to 1) the music involved, and 2) the relative, changing stance of the interpreter to the kind of music at hand, provide the most honest and productive hermeneutic. Add this to a forceful defense of paying attention to popular music (take note, musicologists and ethnomusicologists!) and you have a brilliant, rigorous, but open-ended approach to an area of music until recently mostly ignored by musicology. <br /> <br />Having said that, Brackett takes several subjects for analysis: Hank Williams \\"You're Cheating Heart,\\" Billie Holiday and Bing Crosby's \\"I'll Be Seeing You\\", James Brown\\"s \\"Superbad,\\" and Elvis Costello's \\"Pills and Soap.\\" At each point he critiques and complicates some commonly-held notions, such as  biographical relationships between artists and their music (Holiday), notions of immediate 'authenticity' (Williams), and the notions that one can't really write about music, or that musical difference and marketability are at odds (Costello). Drawing on the work of Richard Middleton, Simon Frith and other music scholars, Brackett builds his case at each turn with the help of speech-act theory, African-American literary theory, and \\"spectrum graphs\\"-- pitch vs time graphs that help the reader analyze and compare inflection, timbre, style and scope in a more tangible way that simple adjectives. But for the more casual reader, the writing itself is easy and unencumbered. This is a good introduction (without intending to be so) for the beginning scholar of cultural music studies, as the reader really gets a good look at the wide variety of tools available to examine music--not just formal analysis.	2004-08-10

He is an excellent known expert in Germanic philology, with special expertise in runes and runelore.<br />2. He is a \\"Setian\\", a devotee of the Left-Hand Path.<br />3. He works in uncovering Spaces of Darkness in Teutonic Religion, from Teutonic satanism (Fire and Ice Llewellyn,1990)-- to, most recently, Nazi Occultism (The Secret King, Dominion, 2002) These things should be kept in mind while reading this review.<br />For those just picking up this book, it reads like a basic introduction to Hermetic Osiris worship. References to Typhon are made in a few places, but Flowers's writing cultivates the deliberate impression that by utilizing the translated spells and materials, the practitioner will be working with Osiris archetypes and energies.<br />Unfortunately, this is not true. By examining the orignal English translations of Flowers' rewritten spells (in the \\"Greek Magical Papyri in Translation\\", edited by Betz,  Chicago, 1986) the reader can determine that Flowers changed the spells to work with SETIAN energy, conveniently without alerting the reader to this fact.<br />In what seems to be a show of openness, Flowers also points readers toward Betz's volume. I'm not going to spoonfeed people by pointing out and comparing chapter and verse. It doesn't take a genius to compare the spells--there aren't that many that Flowers gives you, so go through them one by one. Look for the appropriate Hermetic/Gnostic demiurgic word markers in Betz, such as \\"Sabaoth,\\" \\"Samael\\" and \\"Ialdabaoth\\"(neither of which is Jehovah, that's IAO) and of course, \\"Typhon.\\" Sabaoth, Samael, and Ialdabaoth are Gnostic demiurge names associated with the deityform of decay and destructions.<br />Do your research here. If its too much \\"bother,\\" then don't. You have no business doing Hermetic Magic. And don't ask me to spoonfeed you by email--that's another sign you're not ready.<br />Morevover, Flowers gives the impression that the Greco-Egyptian religious matrix maps onto the Sefirotic Kabbalah \\"Tree of Life\\", without providing any evidence as to why this is appropriate to this kind of magical practice. The DeityForms mapped onto Osiris, if anywhere, belong in the \\"Qlippoth\\", the demonic Kingdom of Shells that lies underneath the Sefirot. Both of these are inexcusable.<br />Bad authorship, and a lack of responsible scholarship and editing are the trademarks of this book.

If you would like to trust that you wlll work with the actual energy you are seeking, then look elsewhere.<br />Do your homework.

Mr. Bennett's book, 'Why We Fight' panders to the intellectually gullible and idiotically ultra-patriotic . Even the basic premise of the book is totally intellectually indefensible and false. His conclusions are equally indefensible and self-contradictory.<br />This premise of this book is that so called 'Western' culture is superior to so-called 'Islamic ' culture. The reason for this, Mr Bennett claims, is that Islamic culture doesn't allow for self-criticism. According to Mr. Bennett, this \\"fact\\" allows us the moral ground to criticize and act aggresively towards Muslim countries as we please. <br />Nothing could be further from the truth. To begin with, there is no single thing as 'Islamic' culture. Muslim cultures are vibrant elements in many national cultures, such as Indonesia, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Lebanon, Egypt, India, Pakistan, and Tunisia. These countries have very different political , cultural, and ideological histories.<br />Widely differing in scope, character and influence, these cultures do owe a great degree to Islam. But to state that Islam allows no self-criticism is to be completely ignorant of world history. <br />In fact, political and ideological debate between different factions and politicians in Muslim-dominated societies enjoys a long history-- much longer than American democracy. In fact, to decide sociopolitical questions, the \\"Ulema'\\" (Muslm public intellectuals) turn to a variety of sources, from Muslim philosophers (Ibn Rushd, Muhammed Iqbal, Brethren of Purity, Ibn Sina, Ismailis) to poets (like Hafiz) the legal schools of Shiite thought, to the Hadith of the Prophet, to the Quran itself. <br />Just as in the USA itself, various approaches and competing ideas are weighed against their probable outcome and the public good....just like any other responsible government..<br />While it is true that there are despotic regimes in power in Muslim countries that limit public debate, it should be remembered that most of these (including Saddam Hussein, The Saudi family, and the Shiite Ayatollahs in Iran) were either put in place or rose to power because of foreign policies of the US and US corporate meddling in their economic and labor market systems. <br />Bennett's big self-contradictory conclusion, inadvertently pointed out here by positive reviewers, is that  self-criticism is all good when its our \\"enemy\\"'s criticisizing of themselves---but when people here in the USA do it, then we're just being \\"self-destructive.\\" If this sounds familiar, recall that the same sort of Doublespeak was used time and time again in justifying the carnage in Vietnam.<br />What Bennett ends up saying is that \\"We're better because we have the freedom to criticize outselves...but we shouldn't ACTUALLY criticize ourselves, because to actually DO that is bad for America. \\" So Bennett would have us end up mainly as a conservative thought-police state where the public freedoms he so dearly loves are meaningless if you disagree. Ironically, these are the types of countries he criticizes !<br />To correct the blatant factual errors in this book, I recommend that the following works be consulted to get an idea of the robust public poltiical, ideological, and philosophical self-criticisms takiing place in Muslim countries all over the world:<br />\\"Geneologies of Religion'\\"by Talal Asad <BR>\\"Just Ruler in Shi'ite Islam\\" by Sachedina <BR>\\"A History of Muslim Philosophy\\" by Majid Fahkry<br />This is an awful book . It is truly sad that so many people apparently take it seriously while ignoring actual Muslim history.	2002-04-22

Not so much for its intellectual complexity, (although it has that) but for the formidable answers the scholars herein set forth to the cries of all-powerful American hegemony that have been heard in the academy of late. While by no means locating America within the myth of the benevolent, neutral harbinger of prosperity and progress, the authors in the text have a nuanced account of issues in the projection and effectiveness of United States power in the larger global context that remains largely in the neoliberal tradition.<br />Essays in the book reflect a variety of perspectives, but all of them involve around some similar themes--- the rise of U.S. hegemony as a world-system in a historical context, beginning in the last 19th century and culminating during the Cold War period. The essays within also focus on institutions created or maintained with the imprimatur, if not the actual effort, of the United States, such as the World Bank, International Monetary Fund (IMF), and to a lesser extent, the United Nations. <br />An advantage to the discussion of American hegemony is the focus the text gives to economic analysis; a topic often overgeneralized in political discussions of American influence. Michael Taylor chronicles the shift from horizontal and vertical stratification to outsourcing R+D, and characterizes this as a shift to the dividing the managerial aspects of material production and strategizing functions related to global market dynamics. Also well-treated are issues of idealism, isolationism, and Cold War containment, as well as military policy, brilliantly expounded on by David Campbell. Perhaps debatable is the minimization of the many of the scholars of &quot;American imperialism&quot; outside the late 1800's.<br />Less successfully covered in the study are the results and effects of American influence/hegemony. Essentially, this volume is about the projection of American power. There isn't anything wrong with that, but for a volume written more by those whose work in American Studies is from an internationalist perspective (and international location (as none of the contributors works in the United States) it would have been more helpful to see more scholarship on reception and transformation of American culture within national and sub-national cultures in other countries. This makes the few essays that cover topics in this realm, such as those by Tim Cresswell, Brian Hoskin, and Claudia de Lima Costa, especially important. <br />Hopefully, future editions will cover more topics in this area. As a politically neoliberal leaning reader, it is perhaps read best in conjunction and dialogue with a more radical reader, such as &quot;Cultures of United States Imperialism&quot; edited by Amy Kaplan and Donald Pease, published in 1993 on Duke University Press.	2002-04-22

Vance Packard's \\"The Status Seekers\\" is a well known compendium and analysis of the nature and development of social classification during the 1950's-a period marked by explosive growth of the U.S. economy, especially among young white families. The thesis of the book, as explained by Packard, is that rather than the creation of a largely classless society in which \\"all\\" were gaining the benefits of democratic capitalism, the creation of an \\"affluent\\" society simply highlighted and created new stratifications, both horizontal, and vertical, of social class based on race, religion, behavioral and consumptive practices.<br />Packard sought to demonstrate his thesis by compiling and synthesizing then current sociological studies, as well as conducting informal interviews among members of various economic classes, policy experts, and professionals in different cities, towns, and states. There is little in the book that represents original thought, but the form, promotion and style of the book made it a best-selling nonfiction work among the general public.<br />It was precisely these qualities that drew so much ire from many critics, especially those drawn from the circles of New York intelligentsia-it was often attacked for its own pretense to provinciality and romanticism of an agrarian, frontier past. The Status Seekers nonetheless stands as a significant work in American Studies, precisely because of its ability to bring scholarly information, especially regarding the vertical stratifications of race and religion, to bear on the nature of class in America, and stands out as a dissenting voice in the consensus ideology and politics of containment that ruled public discourse at the time.  Other criticisms of the book, such as the charge that it portrayed status seeking voyeuristically and hypocritically--- insofar as buyers used it to advance their own status---- are charges more appropriate to the willingness of the buying public to commodify and use as a tool any weapon in the fight to gain greater status. While books are meant to be read, conveying information about such timely topics is bound to get caught up in the politics of the very phenomenon studied. That is not Packard's fault.<br />There are other criticisms, more from a contemporary standpoint, that could be made of Packard's work. It is true that he took from conservative liberalism a predisposition to see affluence as the problem, rather than the lack of it for so many people within the society he studied. It is also true that he played more to the prejudices of the day, especially regarding race and gender, and failed to aggressively question some of the roots of the problems he sought in terms of these prejudices. But the point of his text was not to make a critique of American institutions as such, but rather the interpretations of those institutions as held and manipulated by consumers for their own benefit.<br />On the one hand, we should chalk this up to Packard's Cold War liberalism. Moreover, as pointed out in the excellent introductory essay by Daniel Horowitz, Packard was once a socialist radical, but experienced the realpolitik of Stalin's Soviet Union negotiations with Hitler, and correctly understood the USSR as a form of state capitalism (much like C. L. R. James). It would be worst sort of ex post facto presentism to hold these sorts of criticisms too hard against Packard.<br />Christopher W.

The book does is premised on a statement in the Preface: \\"During the decades since World War II, the entertainment industry has reflected shifting American values and business practices.\\" While not arguing for this proposition in the formal sense, this guiding assertion is an accurate reflection of the tone and tenor of this book.<br />Davis's intent is to sketch a broad series of trends that have affected Hollywood and its relationship to American culture. Most of these are fairly well known-the union strikes of 1945-46, the blacklisting of writers during the time of the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC). Some of these are less well known-the rise of conglomeration in the industry, the advent of Norman Lear's rise in the television community of the early 1970's. All of these trends though, are described in detail and with enough contextual information to anchor film and television trends to issues of larger American culture. This is not to say that major issues are not skipped, such as the Cold War itself or the changing (?) roles of women on television.<br />More so than the particular cultural trends, though, is Davis's need to provide names and brief descriptions of movies and television shows that he believes had the most impact and relevancy to his discussion. Thus, his book reads more like a catalog of different movies, and when they were made. In this way Celluloid Mirrors functions well as an introductory text for those who wish to engage movies and American culture at a basic level. <br />On the other hand, the book suffers from two main problems. First, the author often outlines a chapter under different subject headings, including some that do not always flow together with other subjects in the same chapter, and at the end of each chapter, a conclusion is offered that rarely attempts to reprise the material at hand or link it to upcoming material. Because of this, the book is difficult to follow a get a sense of overall, even though it is easy to understand from page to page. Secondly, the author has a distinct tendency to project a narrative of moral decline on American society, a narrative that with exceptions (especially in the 80's) paints a steadily decaying picture of American society. At the same time, Davis sometimes claims that this represents a form of maturity for movies and television, most notably in the discussion of Norman Lear's situation comedies. However he is not consistent with his descriptions, and the odd nature of the chapters' internal economy of meaning makes it unable to be describes as hermeneutic tension, outright contradiction, or simply poor editing.<br />Davis's book is not bad, but it needs to be read through more than once (for clarity's sake) , and needs some better organization before it can be classified as truly helpful.<br />Christopher W.

US	52382660	R2N8W21CTXXLW3	0521776015	943680201	Artist and Identity in Twentieth-Century America (Contemporary Artists and their Critics)	Books	4	4	4	N	N	Well written--good within certain parameters	Baigells volume is in many ways an important text. Well written, the work is not a comprehensive history of 20th century art; rather it is a series of targeted essays drawn together by similar means of analysis and a range of related themes explored in the different essays.<br />     Baigells larger purpose is to explore themes of identity relations and formations within the sphere of American art. While not concerned with the Cold War as such, his study has the advantage of not historically reifying the post-1945 period, forcing an a priori break in the historical narrative where one may not exist. In fact, one of the great strengths of this book is it explores the development of similar  themes throughout the 20th century--- such as nationalism, the question of American identity, and the upwelling of what Baigell calls the Emersonian spirit of values and value creation. Not only are these important questions addressed, but they are also addressed in a way that overcomes the temptation to mark 1945 as some kind of fixed historical boundary for art history---which is far too often the case in art history.<br />       Baigell is able to go about his task because of two very important assumptions within his method. First, Baigell refuses to consider \\"art\\" as an autonomous, hermetically sealed space of investigation appropriate only to aesthetic investigation. In fact, Baigells method of criticism places art as a form of \\"cultural artifact,\\" perhaps even cultural production. Also, Baigell is willing to admit in his analysis material written and spoken by the artist about the works of his paintings (very few women are considered in this study), but refuses to let his interpretation and analysis of the works be circumscribed by the artists interpretation.<br />      As I stated earlier, Baigell is mainly concerned with two overall themes, the fist being a search for \\"American-ness\\" and the relation of this search to questions of nationalism, ethnicity, religiosity, and political ideology. To this end he explores the left-wing nationalism of Thomas Hart Benton and Grant Wood, the anti-war critique offered by Robert Morris, black liberation as seen by John Stewart Curry, Jewishness in the works of Ben Shahn and Barnett Newman, and the optimistic spirit of benevolent capitalism as painted by Charles Sheeler.  The other main theme, termed the Emersonian spirit, finds a home in an analysis of Jackson Pollack and other Abstract Expressionists, as well as the Stieglitz circle of American Landscape painting and Walt Whitmans influence on early 20th century art. In documenting these themes and concerns, Baigell is quite successful.<br />       Overall, when understood as a series of targeted studies, the essays in this book are more successful. While Baigell seems to draw towards the same themes in many different essays, he is careful to point out that his essays are not meant to be exhaustive, and simply meant to illuminate two important facets of American culture as exhibited in these works. As for his essays themselves, they are best understood as mostly essays of correlationdrawing out themes in painting and art, rather than proving specific influences from theorist to artist. As such, his essays do not in general make strong, definitive claims. They set rather low goals as a rule, and dont have too much trouble achieving them. That in itself is not a criticism--just a reflection on the sort of work Baigell was trying to establish here at this time and place.<br />     Baigells work does have some problems though. In several essays he forages farther away from the influence of American intellectual history on painting, and offers explanations of artistic influence from Jewish mysticism, Zen Buddhism, and Freudian psychoanalysis. While provocative, these essays are the least successful of all, for it is clear that Baigell tends towards oversimplification of these other very complex areas of culture.<br />     In short, Baigell is at his best in the connections between Art-ifacts and American intellectual history-- less so in other areas. Hopefully  we can learn from not only Baigell's successes in this book, but also his shortcomings.	2002-04-11

From trade paperbacks to more scholarly treatments (like Steve Waksman's \\"Instruments of Desire\\") these texts vary widely in scope and quality. Paul Friedlander's \\"Rock and Roll: A Social History\\" is one of the better treatments of this music, although it suffers from some difficulties. Published on Westview Press, the book is written by a musician turned academic historian, and is targeted towards an intelligent readership, although not necessarily towards the strict academician.<br />  The book exhibits a number of strong points, including an opening essay providing a hermeneutics of rock and roll, focusing on open-ended readings of both music and lyrics, while acknowledging the biases and cultural positioning of the critic. Friedlander avoids exclusivist and reductionistic modes of analysis, instead arguing for pluralistic elements of both \\"escape\\" and \\"enlightenment\\" in popular music. This allows him to maintain a critical distance, but avoids a simplistic overgeneralization of the subject matter, as seen in both left-wing music critics like Theodore Adorno and right-wing critics like Orrin Hatch.<br />  The bulk of Friedlander's book, however, focuses on tracing a narrative of influences from artist to genre and back again. While useful, this reveals a limitation on Friedlander's part, a subterranean impulse to regard the history of music as a history of artists. While the fetishizing of the \\"artist\\" is nothing new (dating at least from the publication of \\"Sentimental Education\\" by French realist Gustav Flaubert) it deserves to be interrogated and examined, especially in a text claiming to be a \\"social history.\\"<br />  Friedlander's narrative progresses from a largely white middle class phenomenon in the early fifties, to an infiltration of urban R +B into the musical sensibilities of white teens.  Friedlander is careful to analyze the appeal of early artists in terms of race and sexually rebellious theme, as in the case of Little Richard and Jerry Lee Lewis as compared to Elvis Presley. Friedlander devotes complete chapters to supergroups, and artists, like The Beatles, Rolling Stones, and Bob Dylan, while chronicling the interplay of Soul and Motown music with issues race. Later chapters are devoted to themes of \\"decades\\" (70's, 80's) while punctuating these chapters with genre examinations, such as Punk Rock and Folk Rock. The attention given to race as a guiding issue in rock and roll music is admirable, even if some of the particular conclusions are debatable-here Friedlander shows himself superior to many other treatments of the subject, which often ignore Soul, Motown or post-50's R+B altogether.<br />  Another strength of the book is an extensive discography of the artists covered (and skipped too) in the book. Again here Friedlander rises above others in his careful treatment and guidance to the reader regarding label reissues, as well as refusing to fetishize the \\"original album\\" as the proper unit of record collecting (a fairly recent and annoying trend). At the same time, Friedlander's endnotes are frustrating, leaving very few openings to track down interpretations and influences in his own writings.<br />  In the final analysis, \\"Rock and Roll : A Social History,\\" is a valuable but insufficient introduction, especially with regard to social issues other than race.

This is not to say that the work has no weaknesses, but it remains in many ways an enduring, if somewhat superceded landmark in American cultural studies.<br />      Tyler May's central thesis of the book is that the foreign policy of the \\"containment\\" of communism, summarized and popularized by Secretary John Foster Dulles, paralleled the rise of a domestic politics of containment, where the home space became a way to contain the economic, sexual, and social desires of both women and men. Moreover, the construction of this home space necessitated the casting of gender, sexual, and social roles in rigorous, socially compulsory terms that effectively marginalized many people from ethnic, sexual, and ideological minorities. These roles, constructed through the politics of domestic containment, were held in majority American culture to be necessary to the social survival and maintenance of capitalism in the Cold War struggle against the Soviets. Women in particular, are focused on, as the strong, independent, single role models of the 1930's gave way to increased imagery of the married, safely domesticated woman, who were under heavy societal pressure to give birth and raise children. Men too were constrained by corporate superiors, and looked to home as the one place they could exercise full influence over their wives and children. Not everyone, of course, was happy with this.<br />        A number of surprising arguments are made and defended in this book as sub-theses to the greater point. Birth control achieved social acceptance quickly during this time, albeit \\"contained\\" in such a way as to officially promote family expansion and lower the marriage age. Fulfilled eroticism, albeit only in marriage, becomes a central pointof majority discourse, to the point that women were counseled to pour more energy into their mates' fulfillment, sexual and otherwise, than the children of the household. (this is not to say those actual sexual attitudes and practices always reflected these images, as she points out on pg. 102)  The Cold War demanded that the excesses of capitalism (in promoting huge differentials between rich and poor) had to be checked, lest communism breed and flourish in the nation's slums (147). Fewer African-American women went to college than white, but more of them graduated proportionately.  May even shows that the so-called Baby Boom didn't start after the war, but rather in the early part of WWII, thus dispelling the common notion peace and affluence alone created the baby boom (these conditions also existed after WWI, but with no population boom.)<br />       Another excellent aspect of this study, besides nuancing the role of the Cold War, is the inclusion and careful use of quantitative data, the Kelly Longitudinal Studies---these were surveys taken among housewives and husbands (white ones, to be sure) and they reveal a wealth of data. Rather than painting a picture of comfortable domesticity, these surveys reflect a great deal of dissatisfaction among women (and men) coping with these rigid gender roles. Women who worked in industry during the war had mixed feelings at best being relegated back to the home. Sexuality, motherhood, all of these things proved ultimately unfulfilling for many women in the surveys, causing guilt and resentment in the supposedly \\"placid\\" generation.<br />       Tyler May leaves important parties out of her study. Black women, for example, are discussed rarely, and the labor and civil rights movements (which start in the 1950's, not the 60's) are not part of this story. Subsequent scholarship (\\"Not June Cleaver\\", \\"Tupperware\\") has demonstrated that even in this time, women created counternarratives to compulsory domesticity, that allowed many to ameliorate and contest, if not wholly counter, these discourses. But what Tyler May demonstrates is that these majority discourses of political and domestic containment maintained a definitive hegemony over the public discussions of the day, and held wide sway in the larger culture. Especially through media representations of that time period, these operative models of domestic containment and placidness tend to guide, somewhat incorrectly, popular collective memories of that time period. This fact only serves to further underscore their continued influence.<br />Christopher W. Chase - PhD Fellow, Michigan State Univ.	2002-04-11

His overarching thesis, is precisely that---the years of 1945-1950 showed a sharp swing from grave concern and fear over nuclear energy to visions of nuclear promise and technological utopias, promulgated by the U.S. government and the Atomic Energy Agency, with vocal, dissenting minorities present at each pendulum swing. Boyer speculates that this may form a model for subsequent generations' relationship with nuclear energy, from care to indifference and back again.<br />     Boyer's method is to examine evidence of public thought and conversations during these five years, from &quot;letters to the editor&quot; of newspapers, to intellectual journals of thought, to cartoonists, to the literary world of William Faulkner and Gertrude Stein, to religious organizational bulletins. He makes skillful use of primary sources, demonstrating that while majority opinions could be clearly demonstrated to have existed, undercurrents of contention and dissention remained at each step. Boyer also makes it understandable that as Americans' expectations of another war increased  (59% in October 1945 to 77% in late 1947, page 335) Americans sought not to curtail the development of nuclear energy, but rather trust in technological superiority and civil defense to survive the &quot;inevitable &quot; war, a concomitant response to civil defense campaigns, visions of technological utopia, and simply atomic fatigue---even a subject like nuclear war could only generate a certain sustained interest over a period of time if not directly confronting daily life in the U.S.  However, Boyer also suggests that a drop-off in interest in nuclear issues may have been due to deep-seated horror rather than complacency  (as noted by Elaine Tyler May) This may belong to the more speculate aspects of his study, given that in the late 40's and 50's open counternarratives to nuclear utopia were building, such as in the literary and poetic work of the Beats. But in general I find &quot;By The Bomb's Early Light&quot; an excellent, accessible account of the major movements in a fascinating period of cultural history, one clearly marked by ideological conflicts and disagreement rather than consensus.	2002-04-11

Gross attempts to show that the courts are an important arena where discourses about slave \\"character\\" and \\"nature\\"  crystallized, where certain types of explanations, (like medical ones) grew in favor while other explanatory modes were discouraged. The title refers to the fact that slaves were simultaenously regarded as people and as property (capital). At the center of all this were slave bodies, whose humanitty was clear, and whose legal status as chattel was also clear. The tortured legal reasoning that attempted to negotiate these contradictions provides a fascinating portrait of antebellum race.<br />Gross's sources are excellent--she focuses on cases heard on appeal to state Supreme Courts in the deep South (Louisiana, Alabama, Mississippi, Georgia, South Carolina). At that time Supreme Courts had to hear all cases appealed (not the case today) so they become an invaluable source for collecting trial records. She also examines one court in depth (Adams County, Mississippi) and two smaller courts in South Carolina to deepen and contextualize her scope.<br />She conclusively demonstrates that the Southern \\"honor culture\\" that dominated mainstream white life was dependent on the dishonoring of black bodies, managed to a great deal through the court system, where slaves were not allowed to speak. The issue of slave character and by extension, the character of the master, were always in contention in these trials over transactions gone bad. <BR>However, she also argues that even though slaves could not speak in court, nonetheless courts were forced to deal with the humanness of slaves. In cases regarding breach of warranty, slaves were relied on to give information about their medical condition, as well as information about buyer's treatment of them. Even though they themselves could not speak, their words were often repeated in court by others.<br />Gross also deals with the issue of paternalism  of slave masters better than other scholars.  She contextualizes paternalism as a narrow discourse alongside strict disciplinary codes  and \\"shrewd business practices\\". Rather than draw a distinction between paternalism and violence, like Walter Johnson, or subsume all of slavery as a paternalist enterprise (like Eugene Genovese) we see the complex and mulitfaceted nature of master/slave dynamics.<br />If there are problems here, it is that her study sometimes attempts to beyond itself too far, and in doing so draws on secondary literature a bit much, especially towards the end. Her connection of the courtroom to medical discourse and the slave marketplace seem a bit stretched, but she does draw on the best of the secondary literature in these areas--its just that these connections seem tenous sometimes. <br />Nonetheless, this is a solid study and deserves to be regarded as such in the interdisciplinary field of American Studies. As a study in methodology, Gross is also quite interesting--she combines statsitical analysis and regression with critical race theory and cultural anthropology. Each of these modes of analysis complements and strengthens the other. Within the field of African- American historiography, this is also a major effort.<br />--Christopher Chase, PhD Fellow, American Studies	2002-04-03

Moynihan (later a U.S. Sentator from New York) had caused a stir by advocating public policy based on the common idea that American slavery and subsequent neo-slavery policies had destroyed the American \\"Negro\\" family. By \\"destroyed\\" these historians and policymakers meant that black fathers were historically absent, creating a matrifocal lineage system that was incapable of properly raising children and transmitting cultural values. <br />Apart from the obvious sexism inherent in that stance, several researchers, including Gutman, attempted to find out if there were viable family structures during the antebellum period in selected black communities---first in Buffalo, and then in plantation communities in Louisiana, Virginia, and South Carolina (among others).<br />Gutman found that long slave marriages (including between two persons and otherwise when necessary) did exist over a wide period of time and across different geographic locations. Despite the obvious pressures of slaveowners and white cultures, slaves were able to adapt and maintain families kin networks. While disruptions often occurred through sale, death, or forced displacement, these disruptions caused slaves and their communities to adapt and form larger shared kin networks of fellowship and communication based on patterns devised wholly by blacks themselves.<br />For example, in the face of endogamous practices by plantation owners, slaves practiced wide forms of exogamy that maintained and reinforced stable kinship networks. Children were often the result of prenuptial intercourse, but these parents consistently married each other afterwards. Far from being licentious or indiscriminate mating, these couplings were part of a consistent pattern of social practices. Children were named for blood relatives, further preserving cultural memories---even inscribing the lives of other family members on the narrative of slave children's bodies. through naming. <br />Rather than destroying families---forced migrations and relocations of slaves spread kinship networks wider and spread a \\"common slave culture\\" over the entire South.<br />Much of Gutman's evidence is convincing-especially early on in his volume-the birth records he relies on and kinship diagrams provide a wealth of information that supports his basic thesis very well. His study, although wide ranging, is easy to read because it is very structured, almost dry, in its presentation. <br />Gutman runs into difficulty when he attempts to extend his study beyond the antebellum period (ch. 9 and 10) because his documentation is severely lacking in this regard. Moreover, Gutman has a tendency to reproduce a certain amount of patriarchy inherent in the archival sources he consults.  It is easy to get the impression that even though Gutman defends black women from charges of indiscriminate mating, he does not thoroughly interrogate his sources for the obvious biases they contain against black women. Some of his thought experiments with the data even seem unnecessary and overdetermined. But his basic thesis is sound, and he has the data to support it.	2002-03-14

Moreover, Clarke sees consumer culture of the 1950's as an important, politically multifaceted phenomena. Her conclusions are correct, but her argument is flawed.<br />Early on, Clarke appears to be concerned mainly with outlining the historical circumstances of Earl Tupper, the inventor of Tupperware. Tupper's journals outline a spirit of scientific benevolence in service to society. Combined with a classically-described &quot;Protestant&quot; work-ethic, Tupper's innovation and self-reliance paint a picture of classic American mythmaking at work. But Clarke is quick to recognize that it was the contributions of Bonnie Wise, Tupperware's marketing guru, that actually successfully connected Tupperware to the marketplace, and henceforth to the larger consumer culture.<br />According to Clarke, Wise was the pioneer behind the idea of Tupperware parties. Dismissed by other scholars as mere consumerism worship, Clarke emphasizes the entrepreneurial nature of thiese parties, as well as the social effect of creating networks of communication and support for women.<br />As a &quot;modernist icon&quot; Tupperware embodied effort to meld a univocal aesthetic to practical functionality, while at the same time providing a non-threatening social and financial space for women. What was regarded as homemaking basics became a &quot;marketable skill&quot; (117). Wise herself radically differed from the cultural ideal of feminine passive domesticity that so many have regarded as the norm for the time.<br />Clarke's analysis is valuable, but it doesn't fit the task shw outlines for herself. She skillfully utilizes an array of primary sources, from Earl Tupper's journals to company pamphlets to advertisments. She ends up &quot;parroting&quot; the company's official marketing strategy, and speculates on what that meant in the culture of the time.<br />If she had stuck with her stated intentions, she would have relied much more on oral histories of the people involved with tupperware parties, and others who bought tupperware. That would have told us how the product was appropriated and used by consumers----but we only get 1 page of these sources buried-- and then at the end of chapter 5. Moreover, she fails to adequately address the Tupperware marketing phenomenon in the context of other house -to-house sales schemes she discusses in chapter 4.<br />What she writes is a history of the production of tupperware--not the consumption and usage. That's all well and good in itself---but it is not good cultural history. A cultural history of consumption relies on consumers---not producers---for the consumers are the ones who decide what the meanings of products are---not the producers.<BR>So her analysis of Tupperware as a cultural barometer fails.  <br />How Tupperware is treated by various factors of society seems to me a more valuable measure of a cultural barometer rather than the intentions of the inventors and marketers. Such records give us an insight into production, which is valuable, but do not alone provide a strong enough measure of a product's effects.<br />In bringing these primary historical soruces to light Clarke adds much to the discussion she aims to join, but her evidence does not support a conclusion of cultural meaning-only of cultural intent.  It's a good book, but only if you read it differently than how she intended it to be read.<br />Nonetheless, for its inclusion and discussion of heretofore largely ignored primary sources, Clark's book remains an important part of the literature regarding the mythic and ideological dimensions of 1950's consumer culture.	2002-03-13

Published originally in 1969, the work is an attempt to discuss the theology and religious practices of sub-Saharan Africans. At the start, it must be noted that Mbiti himself is not only a scholar of religion, but is also himself a parish minister, thus he not only a scholar but also a practitioner as well.<br />This book is often cited for its scathing deconstruction and refutation of racist anthropological work that had up to that point been the main systematic effort to `understand' African religiosity. No less than Molefi Asante, in his significant anthology of African Intellectual and Cultural History, excerpted most of Mbiti's  first chapter, which contains his well-known critique.<br />The goals of Mbiti's book are threefold: to refute previous racist scholarship, to highlight the continuity of African forms of religion with other forms of human religiosity, and to establish the diversity of African religion from other forms of religiosity.<br />To accomplish these goals, Mbiti establishes two fundamental concepts in African religiosity: \\"God,\\" and Time. The term God is not significantly explored at the outset, except as a stand-in for a \\"supreme Being\\" in terms largely familiar to Europeans and Americans. Time, on the other hand, is discussed as a facet of African linguistics. By analyzing verb tenses from different language groups, Mbiti claims that African forms of time are different than other human concepts of time, such as linear ones. Ultimately, Mbiti establishes two kinds of Time- Sasa, and Zamani (Swahili). Sasa is understood as \\"small time,\\" or time that is centrally located close to  the present moment. Zamani, in contrast, is \\"Macro-Time,\\" or time that takes place distantly from the present moment.<br />This all stands in contrast to notions of time familiar to Europeans and Americans, such as past, present and future. By marking out two distinct  areas, God and Time, Mbiti sets the stage for an analysis of religion in terms of ontology (or metaphysics) and human experience. Along with Mbiti's assertion of Africans as totally culturally enveloped in religion, this also sets the stage for extensive cultural analysis.<br />In the next few chapters, Mbiti then presents a theological discussion in terms that would be familiar to any Western scholar of religion. He analyses categories such as the \\"Nature\\" of God, the \\"Works\\" of God, God's relationship to the natural world, God's manifestations in ritual, and the existence of \\"Spirits\\" or lesser divinities. In each case, Mbiti's goal is primarily to illustrate that the \\"God\\" of the Africans is the same as elsewhere, although the African's experience of \\"God\\" is unique, and to some degree conditioned by different tribal influences.<br />After this discussion, Mbiti then discusses the African view of \\"man.\\" This is because a theological anthropology (or a 'cosmic' view of humanity) becomes necessary to fully understand African religion. Thus, Mbiti proceeds to analyses African life in terms familiar to any Western anthropologist: \\"Ethnicity\\", \\"Kinship,\\" \\"Birth,\\" \\"Puberty\\", \\"Death,\\" and \\"Afterlife.\\" In each case, Mbiti begins be describing the African human experience. Then he illustrates the mythologizing aspects of African cultural life that make experiences  religious as well as anthropological.<br />Mbiti's method is clearly a reaction to the racism of earlier anthropology, and constitutes a theological apologetics for African religions. In unpacking the relationship between ontology and human experience, his method is also closely related to the school of Religionswissenschaft (History or Phenomenology of Religion) on the rise at this time in the field of Religious Studies.<br />His work clearly has value and represents an important aspect of Africana religiosity. Nevertheless, his work suffers from difficulties. His use of European categories and assumptions causes problems in his analysis. For example, he assumes that the African practice of assigning names for \\"God\\" is a form of simple predication the same way such names are employed in Christianity and Islam. Names for `God' simply signify different names for the same being---Mbiti acts as if names predicate one ultimate subject, rather than possibly positing multiple subjects.<br />Even more problematic is his effort to take concepts, such as creation ex nihilo, and fit Nuer descriptions of Creation to this model. His emphasis on being and supremacy makes notions of mystical power and process, common to many African forms of religiosity, difficult to address. Often his terms and categories are so loaded with Christian assumptions that it takes a great deal of effort to read them out of the accounts that he gives.<br />Another issue that should be raised with regard to Mbiti `s text is his synchronic treatment of African religiosity and philosophy. Although Mbiti does acknowledge that African religions have undergone change over time, his treatment of these religions is largely based on his own  research, and the tone of the book suggests that change is not much of an issue for Mbiti..

While some have criticized the book for elitism, Nelson is right to point out that some in  academic institutions have lost sight of rigorous, critical thinking and engagement--which must be the foundation of a liberal education. Nelson is hardly part of the cultural elite---he writes not from Harvard or Stanford---but from a public university that stays alive with taxpayer support.<br />On the other hand, he takes D'Souza, Cheney, and William Bennett all to task for being demagogues. This may sound like just nasty name calling, but it is important to remember that these pseudo-intellectuals (who have hardly any experience in academia yet claim to know it intimately) have more or less called for the expulsion of anyone from positions of influence who are not lock-step conservatives.....he backs up his accusations with factual citations, such as William Bennett's tirade at the NEH that no more academic conferences dealing with Marxism would ever get taxpayer funding again (even though the vast majority of American Marxists are taxpayers too). D'Souza comes in for slightly more sympathetic treatment, although Nelson rightly exposes Illiberal Education for the collection of unsupported half-truths that it was. Is Nelson getting nasty?---yeah, he speaks the truth as he sees it. That this offends so many is a testament to the &quot;kid-gloves&quot; treatment right wing criticism of academia gets in the national media. That he does it with humor and style causes many to misread him as an elitist (like the &quot;wine&quot; incident that other reviewers mention).<br />The difficult part of Nelson's book is the &quot;12-step&quot; program for academia that he proposes---such as turning away eligible graduate students and getting rid of PhD programs that produce more doctorates than the academy can handle.<br />While I understand that impulse, it strikes a defeatist note with regard to higher education's political influence, and may not be necessary, given that another portion of his advice, publicizing the achievements of the humanities, would provide a counter to the drivel that reactionary demagogues have been feeding the public consciousness regarding scholarship in this country.<br />As Nelson demonstrates, sometimes you just have to directly resist injustice, as the Yale TA unionizing debacle shows. Maybe that's also true with regards to the anti-intellectualism, political and economic harassment that the academy endures from other public institutions (like state legislatures) and private ones (like reactionary think-tanks).	2002-01-07

The volume is heavily weighted towards contemporary African intellectuals, and draws heavily from regional African philosophies such as those in Ghana, Nigeria, and Uganda. With regard to South Africa, book claims that there is no regional philosophy--rather philosophy in S. Africa follows the analytic/continental split found in Anglophone traditions in USA and Europe. Steve Biko's inclusion represents political philosophy in S. Africa. The book focuses early on on deconstructing Eurocentricity in anthropological constructions of African persons and worldviews. Elsewhere the volume aims to delineate philosophical trends in Africa and develops a crtical understanding of the \\"culture concept\\" with regard to these trends, as well as with regard to the development of mutliple rationalities by which different African philosophies proceed (Marlene Van Niekerk).

Perusing the table of contents reveals that many of the essays Morton wanted to include were denied permission to reprint. Be that as it may, this volume is nonetheless useful. It documents a growing movement within queer studies, that of Queer Materialism.<br />Queer Materialism, while not always Marxist, nonetheless takes its cue from dialectical materialism. Gender and sexuality are regarded here as dependent on the means of production. Here the unstable and shifting ground of queer sexual identity is posited as a function of late capitalism, a situtation of quickly flowing and networking capital, which seeks profit outside of &quot;traditional&quot; gender and sexual boundaries.  Thus we see the growing economic importance of gay consumers and workers in capitalism, outpacing and destroying the cold-war hegemony of conservative ethical and religious morals.<br />At the same time, this points to the stormy reception queer theory has recieved in lesbigay studies. Some have argued that this deconstruction of sexual orientation and gender serves the political interests of the right-wing, preserving male and heterosexist hegemony while undermining women's voices  and progressive politics.  Queer theory, like bisexuals, can pose a &quot;crisis of meaning&quot; for many who wish to carve out a safe and protective space for lesbigays. <br />As LesBiGay studies have often relied on sexual orientation/sexual identity as a fundamental category, queer theory attempts to destablize this &quot;bedrock,&quot; revealing the power structures and discursive limits within.   Because of its emphasis on captalism (from a Marxist perspective to be sure) and its deconstrucitve tactics, queer theory is thus attacked from the left and the right. <br />Essayists in this work decry the presence of essentialism and idealism in Lesbigay culture, as well as their child, &quot;identity politics&quot;. What remains unclear, and unanswered, in my opinion, is the fate of queer individuals after the utopian moment of Marxist revolution.<br />If queer individuals are a product of capitalism---then does that mean that the end of capitalism would bring stable and firm gender and sexual identities? What about intersexed individuals and transsexual/transgendered people? Will they somehow not exist? What would gender roles be like in a post-capitalist world? Would &quot;stable&quot; identiites be a good thing? What or whose interests would that serve?<br />Well, these are of course speculative questions, but ones that queer materialism must answer to eventually. Until then, this reader is a good place to start reading and getting to know this subset of queer studies.	2001-11-26

Here he analyzes various forms of mass culture, from the Jack Benny radio program to the TV program &quot;Laverne and Shirley&quot; to demonstrate the existence of queer (non-heterosexually coded performance) narratives at the center of all of these cultural productions.<br /> For example, Doty argues that in popular TV shows such as &quot;Alice,&quot; &quot;I Love Lucy&quot;, &quot;Laverne and Shirley&quot;, the show depends on narrating from the perpective of the women in the show. Doty argues that the plot complications almost always stem from some male interference with the pleasure of the narrator, from unwanted suitors to demanding male bosses. Because heterosocial interaction is coded from narrator's perspective as intrusive, Doty labels these plot narratives &quot;lesbian.&quot; Thus a queer reading of these shows reveals homosocial, if not homosexual, relationships  as the important character and plot elements that are defended.  <br />Then again, it is heterocentrism that defines queer as &quot;homosexual behavior&quot; in the first place, so why should queer studies accept that definition, when its intention is to undermine hetercentrism in the first place!<br />Jack Benny on the other hand, displays a central character whose behaviors are semiotically coded &quot;feminine.&quot; He frets, bites his lip, has a lack of aggressive sexual desire for women, a loose, bouncy walk, and a high-pitched nervous giggle, to mention but a few things. The narrative display a central tendency to displace Benny from situations of power and influence--not the least of which was Benny's self-deprecating humor. Doty reminds us that Benny's biographies are full of his contemporaries remarking on his feminine characteristics. In this case, a queer reading is produced by taking an ostensibly &quot;straight&quot; man and imbuing him thoroughly with clearly &quot;female&quot; characteristics, all of which adds up to a queer character, never fittingin with compulsory heterosexual and masculine traits.<br />These are just two examples of how queer readings are produced in Doty's work. All in all, he aims to show that it is queerness, not straightness, that lies at the center of mass cultural production. Thus he argues for the overturning of heterocentricity as the dominant way of reading culture. A tall claim, no doubt, but one that is tantalizing nonetheless.	2001-11-26

The essence of modern queer theory as proposed here is to move beyond &quot;identity politics&quot; in gay and lesbian studies. The proposal of any sexual orientation as normative, whether straight or gay, is counter to the deconstructive tendencies of queer theory, which problematizes the whole notion of &quot;orientation&quot; or &quot;gender&quot; or &quot;sexuality.&quot; Some have called queer theory the &quot;deconstruction&quot; of gay and lesbian studies, where shifting and unstable sexual identities are destablized in favor of open-ended and multiple readings of cultural phenomena.<br />This points to the stormy reception queer theory has recieved. Some have argued that this deconstruction of sexual orientation and gender serves the political interests of the right-wing, preserving male and heterosexist hegemony while undermining women's voices  and progressive politics.  Queer theory, like bisexuals, poses a &quot;crisis of meaning&quot; for many who wish to carve out a safe and protective space for gays and lesbians. As gay and lesbian studies have often relied on sexual orientation/sexual identity as a fundamental category, queer theory attempts to destablize this &quot;bedrock,&quot; revealing the power structures and discursive limits within. <br />The main qualm I have with this book is its relative lack of literary and artistic culture and the role different authors and figures played in the shifts within queer culture. The book would be all the stronger for the inclusion of such material.	2001-11-26

Rather than a general theory or explanation of  either economics or religion, Weber attempts to draw a specific link between what he sees as the conjunction of the work ethic of Protestant (mainly Calvinist) spiritual teachings, and the success of Western European Capitalism.<br />Weber is an astute analyst, in many ways. He rightly notes that often the 'sine qua non' of Capitalism is thought of as \\"greed\\". Arguing against this notion, Weber  points out that all societies have had greedy people within their particular economic system-greed is thus a factor irrespective of economic systems. Replacing this, Weber proposes that the \\"spirit\\" of Capitalism be thought of as a particular moral attitude towards work and idleness-an attitude that holds that constant and diligent work for its own sake is a moral imperative.  In the face of what Weber calls \\"the radical elimination of magic from the world\\" this work ethic was the existential option left for people in terms of atonement and personal compensation for inadequacies. I believe that these two insights are right on target.<br /> If there is a weakness involved in his characterization of this Protestant \\"Ethic,\\" it lies in the fact that Weber attempts to draw a strict dichotomy in the origins of this ethic. He states forcefully that this ethic does not come out of any Enlightenment thought. The problem with trying to separate this ethic from the Enlightenment, is that this ethic which posits diligent work for its own sake is clearly found in the ethics of Immanuel Kant, who classified this kind of work and labor as a \\"duty\\" (ethical rule) that the self has to itself.  In other words, how much of this is the legacy of the Reformation and how much of this is the legacy of the Enlightenment?<br />The necessity for this kind of work also appears in the ethics of Hegelian philosophy. Hegel characterizes work as a means of the realization of Spirit within the human self, since the performance of duties which one would not normally choose to do can be thought of as a deliberate placing of oneself in the context of alienation. The individual then, through diligent &quot;work,&quot; attempts to convert that which is foreign (antithetical) to the self into that which is of the self. Work is thus a means of overcoming a system of deliberate self-alienation, and is vitally necessary. Kant and Hegel, clearly two giants of Enlightenment thought, both maintain that the essence of diligent work is to become, not acquire-acquisition is a by-product and consequence of work. This is very similar to Weber's characterization of this ethos.<br />Another problem arises when we attempt to draw a strict separation between the worldly attitudes of Catholic monasticism and this \\"Protestant Ethic.\\" While it is certainly true that Catholic monasticism placed a high degree of value on contemplatio, Catholic dogma, from Augustine through Gregory the Great and onwards, held explicitly that one must always return to work in the world-contemplatio was always insufficient in itself as a mode of being. Biblically, this was often seen in light of the Hebrew story of Rachel and Leah, as well as the Greek story of Mary and Martha. The contemplative life is certainly of \\"higher\\" value in Catholic thought, yet it must be seen as returning the soul to the life of activity, lest the soul run the risk of the heresy of \\"Quietism.\\" Some forms of Catholic mysticism ran into heretical issues precisely because they held that the life of activity should be abandoned. So, while there may be a difference in degree, we should be careful not to draw a stronger split than is there.  Weber writes as if only Luther or Calvin has the concept of a life's \\"calling,\\" when this was always already part of Catholicism too.<br />This entire issue actually has its roots in Greek political philosophy, where we see a clear tension between the &quot;practical life&quot;, and the &quot;contemplative life.&quot; The issue persists into Roman life.We can even see some evidence of this type of Protestant ethos in Stoicism, which held that the active pursuit of virtue and public activity was the highest good. Contrast to Epicureanism, which held that the private, quiet study of philosophy and other pleasures, away from worldly life, was the highest good. The issue, of course, reemerges in Christian thought. But for all of its force in Protestantism, we must not take a myopic view that this was somehow unique to Protestantism in Western intellectual thought. Other factors than religion must have also played a role in the development of capitalism.<br />The role of Judiasm is Weber's biggest problem. According to his own endnotes, Jews enjoy more economic success and motivation---so why would Protestantism give birth to Capitalism?<br />We should nonetheless congratulate Weber for attempting to take a close look at the interactions between religious and economic thought. Like Marx, his work serves a good framework to examine the way religious thought influences and inteacts with factors like world economics.We can even see some evidence of this type of Protestant ethos in Stoicism, which held that the active pursuit of virtue and public activity was the highest good.

John Milbank's work attempts to demonstrate  the detrimental influence of sociology on Christian theology. In the Introduction to his book,  Milbank states that he attempts to speak with two voices throughout his text...a voice speaking of behalf of \\"ancient virtue\\" (generally a  Platonic-Aristotelian mode). Thjis mode opposes using \\"power\\" as a substitution for the goal of \\"virtue.\\" Thus, Milbank claims that we should not read those who advocate virtue suspiciously, but rather trust them at their word, (if they are Augustinian Christians, it turns out.) The second voice  is a \\"historicist\\" voice...one he claims is \\"nihilistic\\" ---which I find simply a form of Nietzschean genealogy.<br />          Milbank's chapters are constructed in the manner of the famous wartime strategy of \\"divide and conquer.\\" First, he attempts to show that \\"the new science of politics\\" was generated by a combination of a two factors. One, the discourse of Natural Rights and Private Property (mainly via Thomas Hobbes and Benedict Spinoza),-leading to a liberal political theology and political economy. The second contribution to this new \\"political science\\" is a Machiavellian strain of Roman stoicism, which accounts for the autonomy and fealty owed to the state. <br />       Then he turns to the development of positivism within social theory-especially with regards to the development of the \\"social\\" as an independent self-existent unit....he outlines this as a deconstruction of \\"Society is God\\" (Catholic doctrine) into \\"Society is God's presence\\" thus moving the study of society farther away from theology. <br />      Milbank then foreshadows his deconstruction social theory by stating that the origins of poltical science (a naturalist critique) and what he calls \\"theological positivism\\" are incompatible and contradictory. Chapters 3 and 4 are a race through the figures of early sociology, from Durkheim and Comte to Weber, always in an evolutionary context whereby assumptions (which are always bad if they aren't Christian ones, apparently)  are shifted and further concealed within this body of knowledge. Keep in mind that any study, whether sociological, or chemical, of theological, is always premised on assumptions. Why this simple fact infuriates Milbank is never adequatly explained.<br />      Overshadowing this enterprise is the immense figure of Immanuel Kant, whose Categories of the Pure Understanding, Nouminal/Phenomenal distinction, and the Categorical Imperative are interpreted by sociology as a perfect smokescreen for the obscuring of its own burial of metaphysical/theological (and political) assumptions. Milbank ends this with a general debunking of the sociology of religion as being based on tautologies, which is more or less what he thinks of Kant.<br />        The general theme of the book from this point forward, (through a discussion of Hegel and Marx) could be stated as a development of a Catholic hermeneutics of \\"meta-suspicion,\\" which is itself suspicious of the secular tactic of \\"debunking\\" religious explanations. <br />         The book contains some amusing observations, like calling Adam Smith a \\"heretic\\" and claiming that sociology is not privy to investigate theology because of its own origins in \\"paganism\\" (!) At the same time, Milbank has the audacity to claim that Christian theology is an \\"ontology of peace\\" versus secularity, which is allegedly based on an open \\"ontology of violence.\\" Apparently it matters little to Milbank how his Christian/ Catholic \\"ontology of peace\\" was put into actual practice, in the service of colonialism and atrocity after atrocity. The overthrow of the Hawaiian nation by the USA, the missionization of Japan via Commodore Perry, the colonialism of Africa by the European powers, the enslavement of millions of Africans in the American South and the Carribean--all of these acts stand as as a clear example of Milbank's supposed &quot;ontology of peace.&quot; Of course, he never addresses any of these counterexamples. <br />       In the last chapter, \\"The Other City\\" Milbank asserts  that his \\"Genealogical\\" voice has conquered secular reason by exposing its foundations of ontological violence and coercion. Pitting his two \\"voices\\" (Virtue and Genealogy)  against one another, he concludes that \\"truth\\" (meaning in this case the correspondence of appearance to reality) is itself a creation of an ontology of reason. Since Christianity (in his view) denies an ontology of reason, it does not have to answer to question of  \\"truth or falsity.\\" Therefore Christian theology (in the sense of God's relationship to the world) is left standing over as Social history implodes on its exposed history of violence and lack of own adequate foundations. Milbank does not use the Genealogical method to investigate Christianity, rather it defines itself  out of existence by positing a universal \\"truth\\" of no universal historical truths, logically including itself. How convenient, or rather, how oppourtunistic.<br />           As far as theological study  is concerned, Milbank is content to offer that it should be grounded in principles of critique within Biblical texts and Augustine's City of God, which he thinks offers a more defensible philosophy of history than either Hegel or Marx. <br />        Never have I seen a more intellectually indefensible method. Never have I seen a more \\"selective\\" use of sources and techniques. Why Milbank gets away with dismissing theorists as \\"pagans\\" iin this day and age is beyond me. By the end of the book, Milbank's hatred of all ideas not transplantable to a Christian context becomes almost pathological. Add that to his ignorance of history...<BR> <BR>      The obviousness of Milbank's unwillingness to investigate the history of ontological violence (the Crusades and Augustine--Pope Innocent's \\"just war theory\\") within Catholicism alone is astounding. It is as if he screams about the violence of Auguste Comte \\"theories\\" to turn your attention away from the actual Catholic massacre of Cathars, many who were communally burned alive during the Albegensian Crusade. Not to mention the burnings and historical persecution of alleged \\"witches\\" and pagans....On this account alone, one could drive a 18-wheeler truck through the premises of his argument, which include the absurd  and incredulous idea that the ancient world had no notion of secularity or religious diversity. (As if Epicurianism never existed, or the ancient Hindu philisophical school of Carvaka never existed)<br />        Within theological studies and Christian postmoderists, Milbank has recieved high praise, and therefore this study is important to read. At the same time, try to imagine the glory and purity, theological and social (and racial) of Milbank and  Augustine's City of God. Given his love of the bromidic  labels &quot;pagan&quot; and &quot;heretic,&quot; the only credit I can give him is that he kept from calling Spinoza anything anti-Semitic.	2001-10-31

This is largely uncharted territory for Central Asian studies, and Deweese's book represents a significant achievement in this area.<br /> This text is monumental and meticulously researched, yet it's premises are simple. Deweese examines the historical context of a conversion narrative, both in its Islamic missionization aspects and the history of pre-Islamic Central Asia geography and religious practice. Then he proceeds to analyze two separate narratives-the conversion of Ozbek Khan to Islam and the different narrative versions of this conversion that circulated at different times and in different geographies in the local region. The meat of the book begins, though, with the telling of the earliest recorded version of the coming of the Sufi shakya Baba Tukles and his trial by ordeal, proving Islam the one &quot;true&quot; religion.&quot; The rest of the book is concerned with analyzing this myth, which was so central to the dominance and persistance of Islam in the region.<BR> <BR> Deweese is careful to note that in popular and academic discourse, the idea persists that Islam has a policy of forced conversion or death for conquered peoples, and also that Islamization often does not graft itself onto populations at a deep level, since &quot;belief&quot; or faith is not emphasized over ritual action. He believes both notions are false, and I agree that the historical evidence is in his favor.<br />  Deweese clearly demonstrates that within an Islamic worldview, the production of &quot;eventually&quot; correct ritual behavior can be a gateway for the grace of Allah to produce correct belief, so there need not be such an emphasis on early zeal for a convert. In other words, you didn't have to understand everythingright away to be a good Muslim. Significantly, although Deweese criticizes the common image of Islam as a religion of the sword, he does note that up until the Islamization of Central Asia the main motif of conversion narratives within Islam was that of the &quot;holy war.&quot; Deweese understands this as a metaphor for the internal struggle of the individual to submit to Allah. Indeed, this is by far the more common meaning of &quot;jihad&quot; outside of the overt militancy that the American media has a fascination for.<BR> <BR> This brings us to the rich exposition Deweese has of the Tukles narrative. He finds that the motif of the traveling founder or progenitor is common in Central Asia mythic motifs. Thus the development of the Tukles conversion narrative is evidence of a syncretic production between the structure of Muslim narrative and the structure of indigenous Central Asian motifs. In other words, conversion stories are the result of what the potential convert brings to the experience, just as much as the party that advocates for conversion.<br /> The most interesting section to me was the section that expounded on the mythic meaning and function of the image of the &quot;crucible&quot; as part of the conversion narrative. Deweese contends that this constitutes a mythic identification with the shamanic figure-a common motif of the transformed individual through sacred disassembly and ritual reassembly. Instead of following early work on this too closely, Deweese asserts that this should be understood not only as the creation of a new individual, but the ritual founding of a new progenitor/First Man and also a sacred Muslim community at the same time.<br /> It's difficult to say anything bad about this book. Deweese, in the Introduction, tells you explicitly what his project is...a analysis of a conversion narrative -- and its different versions and motifs relating to a particular community. About the only thing that one could accuse him of is perhaps viewing the religious community in Central Asia as monolithic, and not exploring the different political functions of the myth to legitimate internal power.<br /> But then again, this is a huge book, and this is only a small omission given the grand scope of the book.	2001-10-29

Eliade attempts to show that \\"archaic man&quot; lives in a world that perpetually recreates the building and maintenance of a cosmos. Using many examples from anthropological work and his own textual work in Indian religion and philosophy, he tries to show that all societies practice religion in a way such that each action gains meaning only be identifying with a cultural archetype. Thus, objects have no \\"meaning\\" in and of themselves, but only insofar as they participate in a mythic role. While some might argue against drawing likenesses between \\"archaic\\" religions and \\"modern\\" ones, Eliade does just that, arguing that the three modern monotheistic religions, Christianity, Judaism, and Islam, retain, at the least, vestiges of this ongoing mythic repetition.<BR> <BR> The most important issue for Eliade is \\"history.\\" It is so important, that he  states that the central problem of \\"man\\" is to attempt to abolish history. The word \\"abolish\\" is very important. It helps signify that this process is for Eliade, an attempt to banish the withering, terrorizing effect of passing through the \\"meaninglessness\\" of ordinary or profane time. Eliade states that for \\"primitive\\" societies, time is not allowed to become history. Other, \\"modern\\" societies have felt the need to record temporal occurrences, thus making them irreversible. Instead of abolishing this need to return to a mythic beginning, this has made the need grow deeper. Thus  the role for religion in the modern world is to enable \\"man\\"  to become a \\"primitive\\" again. Not in a sense of rationally dysfunctional, but in the sense of living eternally in the present, removed from the relentless onslaught of \\"history.\\"<br /> Perhaps Eliade is simply describing a dualism, where he could chide \\"archaic\\" man for not living up to the \\"truth\\" of reality. But this is actually far from Eliade's project. In describing a situation where a folklorist had the attempted to correct a mythical account with a historically factual one, Eliadesides with those who refuse to accept the historical account-he argues \\"...was not the myth truer by the fact that it made the real story yield a deeper and richer meaning, reaching a tragic destiny.\\"<br /> Thus we see that Eliade is willing to let truth become divorced from factuality. In his account of evil among archaic man, Eliade argues that evil is tolerable because it is at least never absurd, or meaningless. That is, evil is never without the ability to be fitted into a cosmic scheme that retains cultural purpose. Occurrences, good or bad, reveal a purpose to the world. Even Marxism, says Eliade, posits a meaning to history, expressing it in terms of class struggle and dialectical materialism.<br /> While this schema of \\"history\\" does possess considerable explanatory power, the reduction of all religion to the irruption of the sacred through the individual and culture masks the very real human elements that enforce and maintain religion and religious prescriptions as part of culture. The positing of a \\"meaning\\" by a culture (or subculture) also carries with it the possibility (and often the power) to enforce a specific mode of political, economic, and social discourse. <br /> If we only look at the lens of myth in this manner, we miss being able to see how myth  contributes to political, gender, racial and economic oppression.  \\"Religion\\" then becomes a legitimating factor in the commitment of atrocities we might otherwise criticize or punish. For example, are the recent tragedies in the USA any more legitimate because they were committed by fanatics in the name of \\"Islam\\" ? Of course not.<br />For a similar, yet quite different perspective, read Friedrich Nietzsche's &quot;Thus Spoke Zarathustra.&quot;	2001-10-29

Religion is a notoriously difficult concept to define, so this is no surprise. What Langmuir contributes to this issue is a separation between private religious impulses, and religious institutions. Langmuir refers to the former as &quot;religiosity&quot; and to the latter as &quot;religion.&quot; Under these definitions, almost all humans have religiosities of one form or another, but they do not become a &quot;religion&quot; until some form of institutionalization takes place. This definition is not without difficulties, but it does deserve serious engagement.<br />&quot;History&quot; is also covered in the first part of the book. With regard to &quot;history,&quot; Langmuir's book is more about the interpretation of history rather than history itself. In looking at the motivations and judgments of historical figures, Langmuir questions why we must accept explanations of earlier scholars or historical figures with regard to their actions or motivations. Langmuir argues that as present-day critics and judges we can reach different conclusions about the past rather than be bound by those people's explanations for their own behavior.<BR>In the last part of the text, Langmuir weaves these two notions together to analyze antisemitism. While others have tried to provide social, theological, or racial reasons for antisemitic actions and behaviors, Langmuir concludes that antisemitism is reducible to an &quot;irrational&quot; form of religiosity., a paranoid conspiracy theory about a group of people---like that found in the &quot;Protocols of the Elders of Zion.&quot; Some worldviews are irrational and illogical, and antisemitism is one of them, according to Langmuir.<br />I disagree with Langmuir's analysis of antisemitism, although his work on history and religion is still valuable. Antisemitism has many facets, from theological to social. Certain New Testament quotations can be used to justify antisemitism and early Christian theology, including Augustine, is notoriously uncomfortable with the presence of Jews. Antisemitism and fascism have histories of their own, and are not simply periodic insane ramblings from people who lack appropriate medication. Rather, they are human worldviews with a coherence and logic of their own. This in no way justifies them as practices, but running away from them and dismissing them as simply &quot;illogical&quot; will not make them go away or help us to understand these all-too-human worldviews any better.<br />For a better treatment and analysis of contemporary antisemitism read Michael Barkun's work &quot;Religion and the Racist Right.&quot;	2001-09-04

The problems of Aesthetics that have confronted the field since the 50's and 60's are  just as important as the ones of ancient and medieval European culture. The problem of interpreting pure music (no lyrics) and its aesthetic effects in especially important to this field. Even Ayn Rand, who had a quick philosophical (if often flippant or facile) remark on any facet of culture, admitted she was confounded by the act of interpreting and judging pure music.<br />To address this, the reader should also read or purchase Arthur Danto's volumes. In particular Danto has articulated the main problems of the field (such as the problem of making value judgements) and set the tone. Problems such as ethnocentrism and cultural relativism in Western Aesthetics also need to be investigated by serious students of this topic.<br />Another issue to investigate that this volume misses is the category of the &quot;Artist,&quot; which did not exist in ancient Greece or Rome as we know  it today. In fact, the category of Artist, whether bohemian or otherwise, seems to be a fairly recent invention, and has had profound consequences for Aesthetics. To investigate this more, start by reading Flauber's novel &quot;Sentimental Education.&quot; This staple of French literary realism will help jump start you past this anthology of philosophical readings.	2001-09-02

In this book, he presents several different papers and studies he has done, in the form of chapters. What must be noted is that this is not a general book for people who are just getting interested in Rastafari--but rather an advanced text for people already familiar with the basics of this religio-cultural movement---like its myths, symbols, rituals, and so on.<br />Having said that, the book covers the history and development of Rastafari, from its roots in Myal religion and West African traditions to its development from Revivalism, another religious movement preceding Rastafari. Chevannes also covers Marcus Garvey, early Ethiopianism, and idealizations of &quot;Africa&quot; that inform Rasta ideology. Religious usage of Ganja  and Dreadlocks is also covered, providing a helpful correct to racist right-wing myths about the Rasta. <br />An especially important chapter called &quot;Word, Sound and Power&quot; details the use of Rasta language. In-depth coverage of  concepts such as &quot;Babylon,&quot; &quot;I-and-I,&quot; as well as the tendency of Rasta's to literalize word parts around the meaning of words is helpful. <br />This chapter will also help explain why Rastas shy away from vocalizing oppresion language in there own usage---while making it explicit in the language of those from Babylon.. Thus, &quot;oppressor&quot; becomes &quot;downpressor&quot;--conjuring up pictures of active political suppression. Certainly few understand better than the Rasta the power of language to control and direct thought and action.<br />In addition to this volume, check out the work of Leonard Barrett, and the book &quot;Chanting Down Babylon:The Rastafari Reader&quot; for more, informative, insightful information about this minority religio-cultural movement.	2001-09-02

His thesis is that Rastafari should be seen simultaeneously as a &quot;continuance of and departure from&quot; Revivalism, an Afro-Carribean folk religion. The other scholars in this text agree with Chevannes, and they probe the relationships of transformation in these and other religious movements. <br />Four topics stand out for treatment in this work---Rastafari language construction, the origin of Dreadlocks with the arrival of the Youth Black Faith, the psychoanalytic treatment of the meaning of Dreads, and the chapter on Women's discourse on Possession in Surinamese Creole.<br />Chevannes excels here in the areas he is known for best, Rasta symbolism and history.	2001-09-02

The FARMS reviews and others on this site are clearly driven by an agenda to cover up the historical development of this 19th century new religious movement. In fact, Brooke's text seeks to investigate the depth to which early LDS history is indebted to modern interpretations of ancient and Renaissance Hermeticism and magic. Brooke successfully argues that the three-tiered Heaven, &quot;pre-Creation existence of eternal spirits,&quot; and latent divinity of Man are all derived from a popular 19th century American hermetic milleu fused with apocalyptic Christian mysticism. We must not forget that the Gospel of John itself is an esoteric religious text. The development of Western esoteric and occult thought owes much to the Gospel of John as well as Hermetic thought born of Egyptian, Christian, and Jewish elements. <br />Brooke clearly shows that Smith was immersed in the treasure-divining culture of his time and place, as well as Masonic knowledge, visionary experiences, and other elements of a popular Hermetic framework. Contrary to some reviewers, Brooke displays an amazing knowledge of Mormon doctrine, faithfully backing up his assertions with credible citations of standard LDS theological sources.<br />Brooke does not claim that LDS is an &quot;occult&quot; religion. What he claims is that  American popular hermeticism fused with an apocalyptic interpretation and command of scripture created the early foundations of Mormonism. Contemporary LDS institutions like FARMS are, like many religions, concerned with erasing their origins to maintain legitimacy. But excommunicating scholars and misinterpreting solid pieces of scholarship (perhaps deliberately) will not stand the test of rigorous historical investigation. To those who would let FARMS decide what is legitimate LDS scholarship and what is not, hear this: Religious institutions, like political and social ones, have a vested interest in projecting a certain image. Currently, the Mormon church is trying insert itself into the mainstream of activist Protestantism. But teaching that God was once a man who walked the soil, that earth is (or will be) a level of heaven, and that angels are essentially &quot;recycled&quot; humans, is essentially a hermetic, historically occult doctrine-- and no amount of political whitewashing will change that. There is nothing disrespectful about the presence of occultism in Mormon history---Judaism, Islam, and Christianity all have absorbed heavy doses of hermetic and kabbalistic thought, and all have survived quite well.<br />Read this book. Read D. Michael Quinn as well. Read Bruce R. McConkie, Brian Copenhaver's &quot;Hermetica,&quot; and the Gospel of John, and you will begin to be able to trace the religious development of Mormon ideas starting in antiquity.	2000-11-14

If you're here because you're looking for it--then you've found it.     &quot;The Rose Cross and the Age of Reason&quot; provides a much needed re-evaluation of 18th century esoteric movements in Continential Europe,  especially in Germany. The study is an evaluation of the structure,  rituals, and doctrine of the Gold und Rosencreutz, an esoteric but  politically powerful Rosicrucian order in Germany from about 1760 to the  end of the 18th century. Many governent officials, as well as merchants and  other professionals, were members of this order, which practiced an austere  Christianity, but one powerfully symbolic as well. Alchemy and masonry   also came to the fore in this study.<br />     McIntosh's judgment is that the  evaluate literature so far has painted occultism, especially German  esotericism, as anti-Enlightenment in structure, doctrine, and function.  This is commonly explained by the pietism of its members, who were  resistant tor openly hostile to Cartesian science and metaphysics. The  &quot;G und R&quot; also became involved in a conservative, perhaps even  reactionary monarchy in Prussia (King Frederick William II). As this  Rosicrucian movement gained power, it drew the ire of a number of  Enlightnment critics, and a secret society, the Bavarian Illuminati, was  formed in part to oppose it.<br />     McIntosh demonstrates conclusively that  simply judging the G und R as anti-Enlightenment is not the case, and he  suggests a more nuanced view. To do this, McIntosh identifies three  modalities of thought that were operative at the time in 18th century  Germany, an Enlightenment mode, represented by  Kant and others, the  Orthodox churches (Catholic, Lutheran, and Reformed) and a variety of  Hermetic Neoplatonism, informed by Kabbalistic (both Jewish and Christian)  discourse and alchemy, both theorectical and practical. Between the  Orthodox religious views (the Counter-Enlightenment) and the Aufklarer, the  Neoplatonic intellectual mode argued for a metaphysics illuminated by  divine quintessance at every level. Drawing on classic Gnosticism and  German Protestant Pietism, this Hermetic strain that gave birth to the G  und R shared some characteristics with each of the other two movements.  Like orthodox Christianity, the G und R held to a mostly world-negative  cosmology and pessimistic epistemology, and taught that before all else men  must fear and rever Jesus Christ. However, Pietism, Kabbalah and other  influences gave it a strong emphasis on self-development towards the  Kingdom of the Paraclete, and as such nationalistic development toward this  idea as well. Reason and Science were encouraged so long as they took place  within this religious telos, and many of the G und R and associated  occultists found themselves on this list of prohibited books in Rome.  Relations with the clergy were sometimes tense, and the G und R at times  made moves to silence Counter-Enlightment clergy when they felt their  interests threatened.<br /> What this text adds to a dicussion of  esotericism and intellectual culture is a better framework of understanding  the relationship of these metaphysical and religious movements and their  influence on culture. In much of the scholarly literature and popular  imagination, such religious and magical movements represent a return to  &quot;irrationality&quot; and as such can easily be dismissed by  Enlightenment discourse as unworthy cultural productions. McIntosh's text  recontextualizes occultism and shows that it can (and has) had a pervasive  cultural impact at crucial times and places.	2000-07-10

The essays  focus on what qualifies as Hermetic thought and esoteric thought. Faivre  brings out the notion of the Hermes figure in history as a prophetic  revealer of wisdom---and also a trickster and deceiver. This book includes  art plates of representations of Hermes in different paintings and pictoral  representations. He also addresses the Hermes figure in contemporary  culture, such as in films like &quot;Mad Max.&quot;<br />A good book for those  intersted in Western Occultism, since Hermes and Hermeticism is the main  sources in Western Culture for occult thought. Also read Copenhaver's  &quot;Hermetica&quot; and Fowden's &quot;The Egyptian Hermes&quot; for a  cross-disciplinary look at the figure of Hermes in ancient theosophy and in  Greco-Egyptian religious culture. <br />Good translation---it's by Jocelyn  Godwin, the premier American scholar of Western Esoteric thought. They are  good friends, Godwin and Faivre--and I'm sure that the translation is  faithful.	2000-07-10

Walker's classic text is required reading for anyone who would  understand Magic in the Renaissance Age. Walker writes clearly and simply,  and focuses on two different categories of Magic that emerge out of  Renaissance NeoPlatonism--he especially outlines Ficino's main ideas and  the Pythagorian influence of music on principles of sympathetic vibration  as a magical conduit. This is the best introduction to Renaissance Humanism  and its role in the cultural history of Europe. If a serious but readable  study is what you're looking for, then purchase this book.	2000-07-10

While the book claims that the Theosophical  Movement is more influenced by the skeptical Enlightenment, I do not find  the evidence for that point compelling, since for Godwin what he means by  &quot;the Enlightenment&quot; is really anti-Christian resentment.  The  book should be read as a history of occult ideas in the 18th and 19th  centuries of Britain and America, not as a judge on the Theosophical  Movement as a whole. As a history of that subject, it is wonderful, and no  other books like it exist.	2000-07-10

This text has a twofold project. One, Couliano wishes to elucidate what he sees as the defining charachteristic of Renaissance Magic, that of \\"Eros,\\" and also to account for the shift in thinking that reportedly heralded the  \\"decline\\" of magic in the sixteenth and seventeenth century.<br />The \\"eros\\"  of Renaissance magic started out with optical theory and other medical  concerns with Aristotle (and perhaps Plato), who held that there was a  substance called the \\"pneuma.\\" In Aristotle's thinking, the pneuma was a  substance that was located as a thin shield around the body. In Stoic  medical theory, this became a substance commesurate with the \\"soul\\" or  \\"spirit.\\" This substance was a \\"prima materia,\\" a fundamental substance  that contained the physiological ability to transmit information to the  senses, especially the ocular sense. The heart was the center for a  generational organ that in turn centered the pneuma, This pneumatic organ  was called in Greek --- the \\"hegimonikon.\\" Forming images in the pneuma for  sensory transmission was necessary before a person could percieve something  or someone.  Through the works of late antiquity, such as the Corpus  Hermeticum and medieval physicians such as Albert the Great, the doctrine  of the pneuma became common discourse and was incorporated into popular  culture such as the courtly love tradition. Taken by the bishop Synesius's  (d. ca. 415) synthesis of previous pneumatic doctrine and courtly love  practices, Ficino develops a universal doctrine of the relation of man to  the universe through Eros mediated by the Universal and Particular pneuma.  While mentioning Pico della Mirandola as a sparring partner of Ficino, the  main emphasis in this narrative turns to Giordano Bruno, whom Couliano  believes modified and perfected this doctrine in terms of personal  manipulation and excitation through the powers of Eros.<br />  Couliano, in  the last part of the book, strives to develop an alternate account of the  \\"fall\\"of magic by highlighting the role of the Reformation. Having  defended the notion that the Renaissance was about a revival of pagan  culture, he in turn emphasizes the role of imagery and \\"phantasy\\" in the  doctrine of the pneuma. The Reformation and the Counter Reformation were  primarily about the eradication of pagan culture from Christiandom. As such  they were about the eradication of imagery, manifested in terms of Luther's  accusations of Catholic \\"magic\\" in the Eucharist, iconoclasm, the witch  hunts. For Couliano the witch hunts are a social counterpart to the  eradication of religious-magical imagery--- both are manifestations of  \\"human phantasy.\\" When \\"qualitative\\" statements become suspect (as they  involve imagery) then strictly \\"quantitative\\" science becomes the only  legitimate route for knowledge. When these scientists wax inductive, they  are threatened by the Church(es).<br />Better than Keith Thomas's 'Religion  and the Decline of Magic&quot; but if you're looking for the real  explanations of how Renaissance Magic worked, then you should read D. P.  Walker's &quot;Spiritual and Demonic Magic&quot; instead.	2000-07-10

Godwin is the premier scholar in America in this area.  This text, along with two manifestoes (the Fama and Confessio) made a major  cultural and political impact in 17th century Europe and up through the  18th century in Germany. The Chemical Wedding is an allegorical tale of the  processes of &quot;alchemy.&quot; Written in coded and highly symbolic  language, the book is historically important, but also important for the  practicioner of spiritual alchemy or ritual magic in the Golden Dawn or  Rosicrucian traditions. For the other two manifestoes purchase Frances  Yates &quot;The Rosicrucian Enlightenment,&quot; a controversial but  excellent scholary text on 17th century Europe and the influence of  Esoteric Christianity.<br />This is the first modern and accurate English  translation of this work, attributed to a renegade esoteric Lutheran  minister.	2000-07-10

One of the main thrusts of his book seemed to be that British Wicca was first deconstruction of the  magic/religion dictotomy....and that this didn't happen with the Golden  Dawn because it was  a &quot;magical&quot; organization as opposed to a  &quot;religious&quot; one. Albeit it was a different kind of magic...more  theurgy as opposed to thamaturgy, but still not &quot;religious.&quot;<br />I  ended up more in conflict with Hutton on this, but I found the other  aspects of the books more rewarding. The other part of Hutton I appreciated  was his discussion of why research in this field is so difficult---that the  closer you get to the present and away from Medieval and Renaissance magic  and witchcraft, the tougher it is to function without access to private  libraries.<br />There are some practitioners who would disagree with his views  on topics such has pagan notions of &quot;sacrifice&quot;- but the jury is  still out on many of these issues, and there is still no clear consensus  between practitioners and scholars on how to map many common religious  notions, such as &quot;sacrifice&quot; onto Wicca.	2000-05-12

Smart  either ignores or refuses to engage much of the scholarship of the last 100  years, presenting theories of magic and heresy that have long since been  refuted. The discussion on mysticism is only marginally better, only  half-heartingly engaging post-Steven Katz work on mysticism and mystical  experience. You won't find any of the work of Francis Yates, Ioan Couliano,  Walter Bauer, Bruce Janz or anyone else who has brought the fields of  magic, mysticism and heresy out of Protestant Dogma. Smart's  Episcopalianism shows through with little attempt to hide it, or openly  acknowledge it as a prejudice. <br />Read this book if you want to find out  the way that religion scholarship was up to the 1950's. Don't read it if  you want a serious engagement with contemporary approaches to  religion.<br />For a better approach to the same general topic, try reading  Joseph Kitagawa's book, &quot;The History of Religions.&quot;	1999-02-18
