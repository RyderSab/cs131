Basic construction, finishing, and even decorating ideas are included. <br /> <br />The center section is \\"tear-out\\" full-sized plans, printed on only one side of the paper. Fortunately, I always photocopied (and now scan and print). Finally came the project-by-project instructions with copious drawings of what went where. <br /> <br />Where the outside covers were not sufficient to show color pictures of all the projects (as in v.III), inner color pages were added. <br /> <br />I have the first three volumes. Perhaps some later reviewer can let us know of more. The pattern pages, on matte stock, are ivory with age, but not yellowed or browned. The rest is still glossy and white--good paper! <br /> <br />If I have any quibbles, they mostly come from the age of the books: I use Tyvek bits off envelopes instead of paper for the hinges, and have had to find my own brands of acrylic finishes. The author does assume you will use balsa wood, like a number of others. I have never had a good result in my crafting life using balsa: I always use basswood, which doesn't split as easily and doesn't crumble on the endgrain like balsa does. It works even better. Getting into the craft hardwoods now available has never seemed necessary to me, though I'm now contemplating it if only to refresh the hobby. <br /> <br />Now, would Craft Publications, Inc. kindly re-issue these and make themselves some money? I would cheerfully pay the cost of a six-pack or two of ordinary beer (the international standard of cost) for any missing volumes. The furniture is so well designed, the patterns so carefully drafted, and the instructions so clear that they are quite worth that price.	2005-10-09

I find this speeds the process of sorting ideas, working up thumbnails, and roughing in crowd scenes, though I still rely on Hogarth for anything beyond that point.  If Hogarth's dynamism (his trees writhe with energy) doesn't sit well with you, this big book is a passable alternative, though it does not cover as much as _Dynamic Figure Drawing_ does:  things like foreshortening, the extremely tucked figure, or female [...] are not covered.  A little too much time is spent on detailing small bones and deep muscles that make no difference in the drawing of what is visible.	2005-09-25

Borgeson is here to some extent getting over slow techniques which some of us never acquired, like feeling that any area has to be built out of three colors, rather than using a dead straight one out of the box if it fits.  But there is lots here on choosing papers, working imprimatura, and other methods that let you complete projects larger than a notepad in much less than four months.  Good appendices on how Derwent and Prismacolor pencils match or don't, and where Prismacolor hues fall on a detailed color chart.	2005-09-25

Parramon comments on three different artists, showing a painting from each build up in stages, as well as giving a gallery from past and present.

It is the perfect media for a small apartment (zero mess) and an irregular schedule (the media doesn't dry out before you can get back to work, and the colors stay the same).

I long ago decided clothes show movement far better than the unclad figure does.  If you'd like to move beyond spandex and painted-on metal for imagined figures, this is the only, only book on the subject.  The only alternative are fashion illustration books, whose models just stand there sedately.  Hogarth has worked out the several catagories of wrinkles, which help you imagine them on your mental or sketched-out figures.	2005-09-25

This allows techniques like filling the frames with different papers (those fabulous Asian papers!) or even backing it with a sheet painted to suit.  Different colors, even metallics, for the cut paper, cutting two colors to be arranged on a fairly simply background -- the variety of techniques possible in just \\"cutting paper\\" make this a fascinating media.

Good attention to some small details not always covered, like how to make the teeth in a smile look good, or the different proportions of the child to the adult figure.  Also shows the *properly* articulated wooden model, not the horror usually sold, which will screw up your figure drawing because the shoulders are articulated inaccurately.	2005-09-25

Coming to this after Howitt's 'Life in Germany,' I distinctly felt the lack of illustrations to compare with that volume. However, the lack of maps is easily supplied online. <br /> <br />Howitt entered into the life of the places he traveled with interest and sympathy. Except for an anti-Catholic streak that shows when he reaches Austria, he generally gives a fair and upbeat view of the country and the people, being obviously fascinated with, rather than repelled by, the differences from his native England. His prose lacks the opaque ornamentation of some 19th century writers, making it quite accessible to us nearly two centuries later. <br /> <br />Highlights of the book: a day-by-day tour from Prussia to Austria and back; the arrangements of German farms and apartment houses; an exerpt from a play, showing the different kinds of Germans that might be in just one family; a dazzled description of the period German Christmas, a holiday focused on children rather than, as in England, on adults; the enforced wanderings of journeyman craftsmen, to get them varied experience; the German love of the outdoors; the domesticity of German women; tragedies on the dangerous Brocken; details of travel. <br /> <br />There's simply too much information to cover in detail. For the armchair traveler, especially those with a fondness for time machines, this is a pleasant trip of absorbing detail to the world of the middle class and country, rather than court life, of a time and a place often slighted in English.	2005-07-24
US	52675193	R2LTNK3CKDYCFP	B0007IX79G	552956469	Beau Brummell,: A biographical study	Books	5	4	4	N	N	Biography rather than myth.	There are a tremendous number of stories about George \\"Beau\\" Brummell in many sources, many of which I read on my way to this book. Many authors have a highly negative attitude toward Brummell, having already decided he must be a bad person because he did not have any serious calling in life, and encouraged others to not be serious--his most heinous crime to the Victorians, who got to filter his image through a glass of prim righteousness. They kept his myth alive, though, through loving to use him as an example of how the frivolous will and must come to a bad end. (This, of course, ignores the many equally frivolous dandies who had happy later lives, like \\"Apollo\\" Raikes or Lord Alvanley.) <br /> <br />Campbell takes an even-handed approach to her subject, digs back to primary material, and admits to the many areas that will simply never be accurately filled in at this late date (Brummell's own memoirs were lost). For example, she found and reports the actual source of \\"Wales, ring the bell\\": a story involving a very drunken young Navy man, not Brummell at all. She discards all the later myth, where every amusing story of caddish coxcombery was unfairly attributed to Brummell, as a way to add importance to the joke. <br /> <br />Her most valuable service may be to not take Brummell's wit any more seriously than he and his audience did. Too many judgemental authors grimly report stories like \\"champagne blacking\\" or \\"put in with a damp stranger\\" to show how pea-brained, arrogant, or utterly air-headed Brummell was, rather than noting that his hearers were amused, even to laughter, by his purposeful exaggerations. He was, in his own way, an entertainer, whose power and position rested on his ability to amuse and excite admiration in a terminally bored social set. <br /> <br />She repeats many original impressions by people who actually met him, again countering myth with original sources. She also gives excellent short sketches of his particular friends and patrons, who are often ignored or dismissed as mere fashionable fribbles by writers whose only interest is, at heart, political history, rather than the life of the times. <br /> <br />The book contains a number of illustrations: all those known of Brummell, those of his particular friends, and scenes such as interiors of the Royal Opera and Brighton Pavilion. How that facing page 113 ever crept in to a work by so careful researcher amazes me (I'm inclined to think the Art Department dug up every visual reference to the Beau and did not check with the author). This engraving shows a ball at Almack's, in which one figure is supposedly Brummell. But several gentlemen wear black satin stocks (unheard of during Brummell's reign), and the ladies' Psyche knots and tight bodices down to a nearly natural waist scream 1830s, when Brummell had last been to Almack's in 1816! <br /> <br />If you have any reason to wish to see the ultimate icon of dandies as he was in his time, not as French \\"dandyism\\" or Victorian anti-Regency propaganda created false images with his name on them, find a decently priced copy of this book or get your library to bring it in through Inter-Library Loan. Seeing Brummell clearly shows the society he moved in clearly, making this a most amazing and illuminating book if you have done much reading in the period.	2005-07-23

As such, his emphasis really is on the military and naval expeditions and the peace conferences. Those chapters I found easier reading than most military science books, so I certainly recommend it if you are wanting to get acquainted with the Peninsular campaign. He does fairly slight the war in the east against Napoleon, because the British weren't in it. I was particularly impressed with his attention to the details of what life was like for officers and men between battles, something usually skipped in the concentration on strategy and tactics. If this were all it attempted to cover, I would give it four stars.    His chapters on life in England at the time, especially the festivities around the allied sovreigns after victory, seem essentially good in their description of the countryside, the towns, and the people. However, I noted that his descriptions of some notables of London society were built on common myths of them, rather than better researched fact. Most especially, his handling of Brummell (my present object of research) struck me as so thoroughly apocryphal, built on later Brummelliana rather than actual memoirs of the man, that it made me wary of accepting the author's information on anyone around him. A book you can only use once you have researched in other books for confirmation everything it says, is an unnecessary detour. For the reader interested in the view of England, I could only give it two stars for insecurity, and recommend that you hunt down Priestly's 'Prince of Pleasure,' 1969 instead.    There are NO illustrations in 'The Age of Elegance', except a few battle maps, indicative of the real emphasis of the 400+ pages. At the end, I felt I had picked up an excellent milsci book half the size that had been padded out with the peacetime/home front chapters that are less focused and less deeply researched in original materials.    The author's style iseasy and fluid in the military chapters, without technical gobbledegook: again, excellent for a deep introduction. The other half of the book reads like a compilation of newspaper clippings rewritten by him, as it zooms over the surface of so many subjects, from rural housholds to the supposed mind of this great man or that in reaction to conditions (I distrust his opinions here, as superficial).	2005-07-23

His bibliography lists better books, which he might have paid more attention to. <br /> <br />Yes, I read the text as well as looked at the pictures, which are sometimes three per page. This is the other problem. To cram this many on in the wide borders results in them often being tiny and dark, so that any detail, sometimes any sense or image, is lost. In many cases, items with captions or speech balloons are unreadable. This is the publisher's fault: they could have either reduced the number of illustrations, making more of them valuable rather than blobby, or they could have allowed more pages and put less text per page around larger images. <br /> <br />That done with, if the subject interests you, I can't recommend this too highly. The pictures that are visible are a valuable cross selection, like a box full of snapshots of everywhere: machinery, grand houses, frost fairs on the Thames, bridges, furniture, mail coaches in thunderstorms, and a constant stream of portraits. If you have been studying this period a while, finally seeing the faces of the names often mentioned adds a whole level of illumination.  <br /> <br />As well, the text is marvelously informative on a vast number of subjects. Organization year by year helps the reader see when different influences struck, rather than making it difficult to co-ordinate the war, home politics, and shifts in the arts because they're in separate chapters. Yes, sometimes he does stop to give background on an item only in this year first really important, or move forward to sum up the future of someone he means to not bring up again (and not leave the reader hanging and wondering). It's done very smoothly. <br /> <br />It's a good book to read cover to cover, yet one can then keep it at chairside and dip into it anywhere for a few minutes of entertainment and education. All in all, both a fun book and a good book, a combination rarely found.	2005-07-23

The poster art is evocative, but not informative. Those merely of the modern cities it stops at are better gotten from a picture book about the city. Photos of the stations would have been more relevant. The few maps are Europe as a blob of color with major cities, no idea of terrain. However, they do give the original Varna route and the pre-Simplon route.<br /><br />On the whole, garbage with some good pictures. If you have space on your shelves, money to spare, and a particular interest in the OE, you might get it without pain. The world really needs a good Orient Express book, but this is the farthest thing from it.	2004-12-09

It is not a composite out of many sources, even in the 19th C, with different styles.<br /><br />This is the complete collection of b&w engraved plates from a single German encyclopedia, 1851, but only the plates and their captions. Subject areas include mathematics & astronomy (sky charts); physics & meteorology; chemistry, minerology & geology; botany; zoology; anthropology & surgery (anatomical); geography & planology (maps of continents, countries, and select cities); history & ethnology; military science; naval science; architecture (w/plans of famous buildings); mythology & religious rites (as understood in 1851); the fine arts; & technology.<br /><br />So illustrations range from complex pulleys and horse skulls to knights in battle and how they built the Thames Tunnel. \\"Alphabets of Various Languages for the Use of Engravers\\" includes even samples of cuneiform. Two plates are on theatre architecture. Among the least satisfying may be the engravings of famous works of art for the Fine Arts section.<br /><br />At nearly 600 pages, landscape, the book is difficult to manage on a scanner. I just use a sharp craft blade and cut out close to the binding the pages I need to scan. Then I stick them back in the space. Bit by bit, they are becoming what the originals were, a portfolio of loose pieces. The maps went first: scanned at 400 dpi, they became readable on screen, where the print on the page was too small. I suspect the original plates were larger and were shrunk when photographed for reproduction.	2004-12-09

(9\\" x 12\\" nearly 500 pages)    When other books don't have the historical RR information I need, this will often have at least enough to get me started. It truly covers the entire world of RR, not just Britain and North America: India, Africa, South America, Asia, Australia. On top of this, every page is graced with period artwork or photos, in color as often as possible.    It's a compendium of articles by specialist authors. \\"History\\" subdivides by area. Then there's separate ones on Passenger Travel, Locomotive Development, & Civil Engineering. We especially enjoyed the section on the great name trains, from the 20th C Ltd to the Shinkansen Hikari. Other sections are Railway Operation, Freight Transport, Industrial RR, Rapid Transit, Mountain RR, Architecture, Preservation, RR in the Cinema, RR At War, biographies of notable figures, \\"The Artist's View,\\" Records, Disasters, Chronology, Facts & Figures, and a glossary for the newcomer. All this, and huge beast is indexed, too.    As specific reference on this or that line, no, of course not. You couldn't do all of them in less than a room of books. As a general reference to lots of them, great.	2004-12-09

The most complicated have two pages of plans with two pages of remarks and &quot;Bill of Material&quot; (parts list).<br />Originally copyrighted in 1931, this has been reprinted by the likes of Bonanza Books in recent years. This book was designed for the trained home woodworker and for the teacher of advanced wood shop classes at vocational high schools. The projects are called &quot;problems&quot; for classrooms, and are designed to challenge students as they increase in skill, though the book itself does not teach the skills: turning on the lathe, cutting mortise &amp; tenon joints, etc. Even where he gives rudimentary instructions on making rush seats, he suggests getting a book on chair seating.<br />If you can deal with this, you may enjoy the project range. The 8 miscellaneous projects range from book ends and frames to lectern and library magazine rack. There are nine tables, 6 stools or chairs, 6 desks or chests, 6 cabinets or shelving units (they overlap), 2 clocks and 2 beds. I should note that none of these are &quot;authentic&quot; reproductions of any particular antique, but are all the author's (excellent, skilled) designs in the Early American style, often a bit simplified from the original methods. He also includes furniture for modern living: smoking stands (ashtray pedestals), radio cabinets, bulletin boards, etc.<br />The chapter on furniture finishing weighs the pros and cons of shellac vs. varnish, and tells how to apply both and trad wood sealers, but of course has nothing to say about modern finishes like acrylic or urethane.<br />Consider this an addition of projects to your library of how-to books on woodworking and finishing, rather than any kind of training text, either beginning or advanced.	2004-07-05

Art Nouveau was not just twisty flowers, though some people like to stereotype it into those narrow parameters. This is not a how-to book with cutting patterns. It has only the paintings with suggested scale. On a few pages, motifs overlap each other, so you can't just scan and go: you have to build up your idea of the covered areas. One pictorial arched piece is missing the right third, again a challenge to finish it yourself.<br />The designs range from splendidly romantic conceptions of floral forms to windows a-scamper with squirrels or lizards to some that are distinctly eerie. Bats fly across the moon amidst dead trees. A woman combs her hair before a volcano flowing lava. An octopus and a sea-weed maiden struggle underwater--in combat? in love? Several have fishes and there are even cat designs.<br />You don't have to see these only as windows. I've converted two to rug designs by taking out the excess black lines of supports or piecing necessary to glass work. You may want to take only one area out of an entire design to render in wood, or do a mosaic version of the whole thing. This is a starting point for the competent craftsman who loves the Art Nouveau energy, not an end product.	2004-06-05

It requires you draft your own square-cut patterns from measurements and the instructions sometimes take rereading for me to figure out (a 20-year career as a pro costumer and a dresser for Kabuki Hawaii trained by experts from the National Theatre of Japan, so I am am very familiar with both seamstry and Japanese costumes of many sorts). The tissue patterns have much clearer instructions and diagrams. You need self-confidence and some moderate skill with the usual sewing to jump over to this.<br />First, Marshall assumes you also own The Book of Kimono by Norio Yamanaka. While Marshall will tell you how to draft patterns for the kimono, he tells you to go to the other book to find out how to =wear= the garments. Yamanaka's is a wonderful book, but I consider this sales-racketeering by the editors, allowing author sloth to force another book in the line. If you don't already know how to wear kimono, get Yamanaka first so you can even decide if you want to wear it, let alone sew it.<br />The section on Japanese sewing tools was interesting, but time might have been spent addressing how to do these jobs with tools you could find in ordinary Western sewing stores, and how to select Western fabrics (like don't use slinky for an uchikage), since so much time is spent on making Westernized/modernized variants on the trad kimono. 4ex, you can make a 3rd hand out of a strong little coffee bag clip, a length of cord, and a necklace hook rather than paying $8 + S&amp;H on-line.<br />The largest flaw is the structuring of ideas. Marshall first tells you how to do each Japanese sewing technique (how to turn a hem corner, how to sew on a sleeve, how to put in a lining, how to pad a garment) in a separate section before ever getting to describing the garments or giving their layouts. All this means is anyone not already completely familiar with the garments skips this and maybe comes back later to it. The book would be improved by giving the garments with sewing techniques particular to it included at the garment. 4ex., explaining how to sewn on a collar guard particularly for a vest belongs with making the vests, not broken out 57 pages earlier with other collar guard techniques. Explaining how to put in a lining should be with  the first garment that can be lined. As it is, you go to the garment, draft it, cut it, then skip back and forth between the garment and the different technique sections as you sew on a collar or sew on a sleeve. Keep plenty of bookmarks handy.<br />It is good that Marshall gives the standard kimono, and especially the uchikage (female formal overkimono) with padded hem, as well as various jackets (haori, hanten, hippari), modern and trad vests, and the monpei trousers. It is a distinct lack that he did not give directions for hakama, the Japanese trousers everyone wants for male dress, but only the sloppy field pants. The drafting instructions are very good, but as an Old Guard of the fibre arts the selection of garments gave me severe deja vu. In fact, except for the uchikage, this could be described as &quot;do all your own drafting work to wind up with the Folkwear Japanese patterns.&quot; Which do you have more of, time or money? Do you really want to learn the particularly Japanese method of wearing a thimble or finishing a seam?<br />The section on making your own tabi (split-toed cloth socks) is excellent and detailed. Drafting this pattern is not at all simple, as it is fitted footwear. If you can't find tabi cheap on line, I recommend getting the Folkwear pattern for them to save a day or more of your life with fussing these to fit, unless you have very unusual feet.<br />In short, while the book will remain in my library and will be useful for drafting scale patterns for dolls, when I sew for full-size people I will use the available patterns using authentic techniques. What were you planning to use this for?	2003-09-23

The writing sounds remarkably like a report. Unfortunately, what it is supposed to be is a novel. As a novel, it is the flattest and least interesting I have found in print, and I collect vanity press novels for fun. I kept waiting for something exciting to happen, or rather, for something to be presented in an exciting manner. No such luck. The writing is determinedly passive, padded (heavy on the bureaucratese gobbledgook phrases), sprinkled with malapropisms or improper usage in the narrative, Tells too often where it ought to Show, and astonishingly bald of any descriptive or atmospheric passages. Areas where scenes take place are merely given as street names, as if every reader knew Boston so well that that there could never be any silly questions like &quot;is this a bad neighborhood or a ritzy one?&quot; As long as the book is only bought and reviewed by personal aquaintances of the author, this will go unnoticed. Apparently I am the first outsider to make the mistake of buying this. <br />The POV, if stringent, is crude. The switch from 1st person to 3rd makes me think of this as a Mary Sue, a wish-fulfilling self-insertion story. The writer wrote it as &quot;I do this and I do that&quot; and then decided he needed to show the bad guy being bad and inserted the 3rd person sections. In fact, because of the way the plot turns, this is not only unnecessary, but helps cut tension. Not that there is much tension anyway. &quot;Bead-plotting&quot; and the fact that the good guys are never really out of control of the situation, never seriously challenged or menaced, and no one gets worse than bruises from stopping rounds with their vests means that everything fizzles. Again, it's a Mary Sue trait. The cop stories are not interesting when they don't have any point for the plot or characterization. If the author wants to write a book of anecdotes, fine, but that's not what this is advertised as.<br />Is therestill time for me to get my money back?	2002-06-25

I don't care for thrillers, so I was pleased to find some recent work of hers outside that genre.<br />The cover blurb, etc., does not really prepare you for the story. It is not so much about two people drawn over the bounds in modern Seattle as an exploration of the past. The major and most important part of the book is a trip by the lead characters into ancient days in order to try to change the world into which they were born to make the heroine's survival possible. The greater journey, though, is into the heart and mind of the hero as he discovers that it is not an ancient law but a long-cultivated flaw in wizards that is the true barrier in their romance.<br />Character is all in romances, and in this one you get a dandy assortment, complete with a secondary romance couple and even major antagonists you can come to understand (if still dislike). On top of this, add a charming visualization of magic and perfect atmosphere in the exotic sections where the implications of the culture are well followed-out. Combined with Kay Hooper's storytelling and pace and a hero and heroine whose obstacles are not in the least contrived (none of this &quot;one sensible question would solve everything&quot; stuff), you are in for a fine read. I meant to stretch this out, but wound up gobbling it up the first evening.<br />Why only four stars, then? Say I'm being mean because I expect a great deal from an author with this much talent. The characters are somewhat stereotyped, a common failing of the genre. I don't know if the heroine is rash because she's redheaded or redheaded because she's rash, but I'm tired of hair color and personality being so tied together. I'm also way tired of blue-eyed blondes and green-eyed redheads. Every natural redhead I've known had usually brown or occasionally blue eyes. The only green eyes I've seen were on brunettes. But when was the last time youread a redheaded heroine in a romance who didn't have green eyes?<br />The ending, I'm sure, will not be quite what you expect, either in Seattle or out of it. It's worth the money: indulge yourself in a good read.	2002-06-25

I have no urge to immediately give a second reading to pick up all the nuances and depths I missed the first time through because one can catch everything on one reading. They're good fun, but not *great* reading.<br />The book can stand alone, but since you're here at a book store, pick up 'Guilty Pleasures' to make everything crystal clear. Also because it's a better book and you might as well see Hamilton at her best to carry you through lesser volumes. The Laughing Corpse is a different book, yes, but the writing quality has dropped as well on objective levels.<br />This is not a vampire book. Those from GP appear almost as cameos, more to set up future books and to keep them in mind than to further this story. Other characters could have been used for their functions, but it was nice to see the fang gang again. This story concentrates on Anita's abilities as an animator, raising the dead, dealing with zombies, and some of the implications of that power she has been staving off.<br />Technical writing flaws have been allowed to creep in: comma splices, using the same word \\"gleaming\\" three times in ten lines, little distracting teeth-grinders that I still remember the next morning. <br />More importantly, this volume uses gratuitous gore as sheer padding. The gross-out contest shows the characters involved as immature, unprofessional, and disrespectful of murdered women and children. Is this really what Hamilton wants us to think of Anita and the RPIT crew? The tremendously detailed crime scenes this time around, as opposed to those in GP, make me think someone gave the author a copy of 'All the Gooey Gunk Inside' and, when she found herself 15,000 words short of a novel she used it to pad things out. It's okay in the first murder scene to set up the horror, but elsewhere it's a weary drag on the story's pace. I wound up skimming it in boredom. She should have used another Jean-Claude scene and moved things along on that line, at least, rather than just marking time.<br />Also, I was persistently thrown off by the long-term voodoo queen of the Midwest being Mexican, and the whole business being treated as if primarily a Mexican religion. Voudoun comes out of francophone Haiti. I would expect Santeria or Spiritism out of an Hispanic community. Read 'The Magic Island' and 'The Serpent and the Rainbow' for some NF on voudoun.<br />At least a bit more of the story world background is explained, like why vampire criminals are executed in the field rather than any attempts being made at trial and incarceration. Her timeline is off here, though. Vampires have only been legalized two years, Anita has been the Executioner for two years, yet the executioners are said to exist in response to something that happened within that two years. Sloppy, but that's sort of the motif for this volume.<br />If GP was a bag of Oreos, this was generic chocolate sandwich cookies. Okay for a snack attack, but it could have been better.	2002-04-04

I'm just starting the series, and I'll be reviewing them as you would read them: one at a time without knowing what comes later. I don't usually read either horror or mysteries, but this was great fun, like a ride through a really good haunted house.<br />In this first installment, we meet Anita, who is not just starting out in this business. She already has a lot of backstory and history that adds a feeling of depth to the world and character. People come out of the past, rather than all being invented new. I loved the character (nah, looking like her and sharing her violent attitude in life couldn't influence that) and enjoyed being her for the length of the book. Twenty-four seems a little young sometimes for who she has been and how she comes across, but one can say it's the mileage from her chosen activities. While most reviewers concentrate on the continuing characters, I can't understand how they can review without noticing the chance Philip gives for Anita to be thoroughly human, and Edward for her to be properly scared of the thoroughly human. Philip won me over as grudgingly as he does Anita, and I'm looking forward to seeing Edward again.<br />Note these things about Anita's moral stance as you go. When the Pope made animating a mortal sin, she left Catholicism and became Episcopalian rather than give up raising the dead. She herself says that if she examined her stance on killing vampires, she could not do her work, indicating she is already aware her current principles are not well-founded.<br />If there were writing flaws, the narrative drive, action, and character carried me right past them. I'm easily turned off by poor writing, so I have to call this good. It's scary where it needs to be, gruesome where it ought to be, and sometimes tender when you don't expect it. My only tech complaint is that the fight with the were-rat seemed a bit contrived. That, and Nikolaos is a male Greek name. A girl would be Nikolao.<br />Now, for the minor down side. When I read a book, if I really like it I normally reread it immediately to catch all the nuances I didn't the first time and watch the structure of the plot and the characters build up. I read this and put it aside. It's not deep. You can get everything on the first run-through, and frankly there are some things I'm trying mightily *not* to think about because it will break down the believability of the story-world for me. I want to enjoy it while it lasts.<br />So this book is like a bag of potato chips, not a full meal. I'll read the series now, and probably again in a few years,  for light entertainment. I don't know if it will hold up for a third re-read. The basis of how vampires would intersect with the legal system if they were \\"legalized\\" (they aren't illegal now, I'll have you know), while supposedly the core of the books, is actually very shaky. In most ways, this is a gread lead character moving in a world where supernatural creatures are viewed as newly natural but doing the usual lone wolf adventures while avoiding official help. It's a good adventure, but the speculation does not quite mesh.<br />I leave you with one final question: why is the drool-object male vampire always French? It's getting to be so cliche.	2002-04-04

From the author of 'People's Names': <br />I didn't know how much my library needed this. It may at first seem a relatively brief book, but you more than get your money's worth. <br />The prose is clear and simple, but the information is densely packed. No marshmallow padding to let your brain relax. Plan on reading no more than a chapter a night to absorb this, or you'll start getting foggy from information overload.<br /> If you have not faced a contract, this will prepare you for most of what you are likely to be offered, and what you might ask for or change. If you have signed contracts, you may want to kick yourself for not reading this sooner. (I did. One or two light kicks, not bad.) The next contract I go over, with a new agent or not, is going to give me a lot more than the last one. It will also help me double-check my new agent. <br />O wishful beginners, agents are not only not omniscient, they are often looking out more for their interests than for yours. This means that some will try to keep the publishers real happy with them and not push anything you don't demand. If you don't know what to push for or adjust, the agent won't necessarily rock the boat by making suggestions. Some day I'll get one of those agents who is a writer's best friend, but until then this book helps me be my own best friend in the business.	2002-03-01

I have zero interest in fight choreography, preferring combat sports. I bought it because I am a long-term fan of Hobbs' work. Reading this not only opens to the outsider part of the film crew not covered, but shows the tremendous amount of work, detail, planning, thought, and creativity that goes into a stage or screen fight that excites both the least and most knowledgeable members of the audience. There's also some fairly funny anecdotes.<br />For those looking for fight help, Hobbs emphasizes safety, acting, concentration, and rehearsing, rehearsing, rehearsing. He gives no set patterns, except by examples. He covers all the basic techniques for slapping, punch-outs, and the sort of sword-work required for period plays. There's even &quot;how to strangle&quot; for those doing &quot;Othello.&quot; He does expect the user of this book to then go forth and plan his or her own fights, and to continue to research far beyond this book. He does not attempt to be the only book you need. As a result, it's very accessible for the newbie.<br />As a history buff, I found the old engravings and photos from stage plays fascinating, too.	2002-03-01

The author, a professor in classics, wrote it in 1974 then updated it in 1994. Complacently, in the forward he announces that it needed almost no changes.<BR> This statement made me leery. In these 20 years, archaeology has had revolutions of information and theory. Casson knew that he knew everything, so he did not bother to research all the areas where he was under-informed and way out of date, even in 1974.<BR> What is out of Greek and Roman writing is cooked down for you with greater depth and breadth than you will find anywhere else. He is especially strong in the late Roman period. However, classicists are oriented to writing and civilizations. Like most of them, Casson is very weak in his first, pre classical chapters, having no knowledge of human travel outside of the major civilizations. He still has astonishing holes in his classical chapters.<BR> For example, time does not excuse his saying about Roman war galleys: &quot;little more than oversize racing shells, they necessarily followed the coasts and put into harbour every night.&quot; Exert a little logic. These were designed for ramming warfare: not fragile, not low-sided. Get particulars out of Rodger's 'Greek and Roman Naval Warfare' (1937) Also, you cannot surprise an enemy place if you coast-crawl up to it; nor can you chase an enemy fleet at sea if you can't sail out of sight of land. If the galley puts into shore each night, it is because the official on board requires it, not because they can't sail open waters at night.<BR> Casson does pass on the evidence against the wide-spread myth of cemented Roman roads, pg168. Thank him for that. Then he treats as fact the 1930s theory of Lefebre des Noettes, whose shoddy observation and distinctly biased study declared that horses were harnessed by *all* the ancients with the same choking &quot;ancient traction system&quot; that never existed, and that saddles, stirrups, and horseshoes were not used until the Middle Ages. <BR> LdN's theories, long thought suspect by people with a better eye for ancient artwork, were thoroughly exploded by Spruytte (see 'Early Harness Systems' 1974) which reconstructed three major systems, none of which discomforted the horses he used. All three were used through the 1800s in slightly different forms. Evidence exists for nailed horseshoes in Rome, not hipposandals, from the 1st C CE (impressed in brick), for saddles from 5th C BC (Pazyryk), and for stirrups from a similar period. Archaeologists who keep excusing early horseshoe finds as &quot;special cases&quot; have not freed themselves from LdN's dishonesty.<BR> In any case, Casson's contention that these last three items are necessary for comfortable riding over long distances is not borne out by long distance riders. Modern 100-mile eventers from desert, semi-desert, or Mediterranean climates may never shoe their horses (Hyland) despite high mileage training. Choose a horse by ancient rules of conformation (Xenophon), with a well-padded rather than high-spined back, and it should be comfortable, especially to people who do not know saddles &quot;ought&quot; to exist. Bareback is *more* comfortable for long overland rides, esp. as stirrups strain and cramp the ankles and knees. One avoids all the problems of getting a saddle that fits the horse that fits the rider, and doesn't injure either. At the Spanish Riding School of Vienna, for the first few years new riders train with no stirrups to develop a good seat. Stirrups are only necessary for warfare and stock work. Over-dependence on them makes a poorer rider.<BR> Casson also subscribes to Victorian social Darwinism: first humans were wandering hunters, then nomadic herdsmen, then finally farmers.<BR> The modern knowledge is that humans were wandering hunters, then settled farmers. Only around 3500 BC, as the last of the Ice-Age glaciers shrank and the world got drier, did they invent nomadic herding. Horses weredomesticated about 4500 BC (Sredni Stog excavations) by farmers with no vehicles. Since the teeth of excavated skulls show bit wear, the horses were ridden. The idea (passed on by Casson) that horses were only driven until the classical period is an out-of-date theory due to urbano-centrism and wide spread ignorance of horse-handling.<BR> As well, Casson seems unaware of the use of sledges before wagons in Mesopotamia (Piggot, 'Wagon, Chariot, and Carriage') or of the traveling done by Neolithic traders. All part of his early period weakness, but he apparently doesn't *care* about that period. It's just a lead-in to what he considers the good stuff, the classical period.<BR> If you keep these holes in mind, it can be a fascinating book, opening a door on ancient tourism and traveller's lodging that I was very glad to have read.

While this has great soft doll patterns, the clothing patterns leave something to be desired, especially if you are looking at this for Barbie clothes.<br />For example, in the Victorian section the corset is for a much fatter doll than the bodices are. Yes, the bodice goes over the chemise and corset, but this should be allowed for in the patterns. The corset was an inch too large! The chemise style matched nothing in my reproduction catalog sources, so I had to draft my own to get something authentic.<br />The hats are made for round heads, with round holes. Dolls, like people, have oval heads, so unless the hair is built out on the sides, they don't fit well. The shoes will fit her female cloth dolls, but not vinyl ones. Just to warn off those of you expecting stress-free Victorian boots for Christie.<br />There are fat gaps in the fashions represented. She seems far more interested in children's styles than adult female styles, and in some eras the male dolls are almost forgotten.<br />Use this book carefully. It can be a great shortcut compared to drafting from scratch, but everything has to be made on the cheap in fitters first, because nothing is trustworthy until you've checked it. She herself says these patterns will have to be modified for different dolls, especially now thirty years later when Mattel alone produces four Barbie bodies, 11 1/2 inches tall but differing enough in measurements that clothes bag or won't go on between them. Xena? Charice? Prepare to modify.<br />If you are making clothes for your kid's dolls, it does cover all the sizes from Mattel IF you make adjustments. For example, the one woman's pattern will have to do for regular Barbies, Gen Girls, and Teen Skipper. There are sizes to suit Staci and Todd (&quot;children&quot; not the larger &quot;boy&quot; and &quot;girl&quot; which suit the 1960s Skipper) (specifically #6, #23, #27, #43, #54, #57, #82, #84, #86, #87, #88, #89 for Staci, and the only male ones, #49, #66 &amp; #90) and Kelly and Tommy (&quot;baby&quot; #11, #12, #26, #39, #58, #59, #81 which are for a pre-crawler in diapers, not a toddler).	2001-06-01

Wonderfully well-researched, in everything from the organization of cavalry to the methods of training colts, from veterinary treatments to protein content of ancient grains, from the conduct of a chariot race to  mule-breeding.  Hyland is generally level-headed and takes research  questions out to the training ring:  she can show you the effect of the  Roman bit excavated at Newstead on her &quot;equine research  associate&quot; in photos. The downside:  Chapter One, on breeds.  Hyland  is blatantly Arabophilic, so that she makes unwarranted links between the  Erembian (Arabic) horse and the small Libyan, which is quite likely next of  kin to the small horses (&quot;native ponies&quot; to some) of West Africa.   Also, her assessment of the Hunnish horse based on ancient description is  entirely illogical and sounds like a pre-settled prejudice, that those  nasty Huns MUST ride nasty, low-bred, ugly horses.  She calls a horse said  to train well stupid, and reads the adjective gaunt in the belly as being  undernourished, while I know the exact same phrase is used of her perfect  Libyan horses.  I ran this same description blind (no mention of source or  name, just &quot;this is an ancient breed&quot;) past a life-long horse  person from a horse-breeding family and got a result of something like a  ram-nosed Lippizanner, a very good horse indeed.  If you ignore this one  fall from grace, it's an excellent book for those interested in the  culture, which was so focused on equines as machinery as well as status  symbols.  It's probably worth the second-hand price.	1999-02-03

While giving some description of each one's  experience, it does not go into depth on any one, and is best to get you  grounded before deciding which of these original reports you need to read  for further research.  For the casual history reader, it will be  interesting for you to learn of the hopes the Church pinned on the Mongol  empire coming to the aid of Crusaders, and the development of the legend of  Prester John, always receding to the East until the end of land was  reached, whereupon he was transferred to Africa as the terra incognita.

The author collects a great deal of information from scattered sources on the earliest mentions of horses in West Africa, their types, and their use.  The coverage of West African cavalry is very good.  Unfortunately the  author knows little about horses, as he confesses, and so did not dig for  the information a reader might wish:  nutrition of traditional diet,  training, etc.  This is a pioneering effort, and leaves a great many  questions still to answer.  At some places in Ch. One his dismissal of  evidence as being of course too late smacks of assumption as he has given  no better evidence to the contrary.  The use of one rein on a bitless  bridle to control horses in the most ancient tradition would seem less odd  to him if he had investigated the known history of the Libyan horse, a very  amenable beast ridden with no bridle at all, responding to taps with a  stick as well as the rider's leg aids.  In short, he has spent his time  assembling ancient texts and more modern information from his own field  studies, but lacks the background to really pull this together.	1999-02-03

Warlord wraps up the tale as Carter takes up the  trail of the incomparable Dejah Thoris, following her captors to the hidden  cities of the polar regions, culminating in a battle that settles the  future of Barsoom.  All the breathless adventure, daring swordplay,  hairsbreadth escapes, and dry humor you could ask for.  Even more in  control of his material than in the other two excellent volumes, Burroughs  challenges himself both to keep in the established material about Barsoom  and still invent new elements.  If you have not read the Barsoomian  trilogy, and you love SF adventure, buy it NOW!  You will re-read it with  delight the rest of your life.	1998-11-18

This one's text, though, is an excellent beginner to intermediate  level history, so with the superb maps you may not need another reference  book on the subject.

Despite superb maps on some subjects you never imagined, like the various  shifts in the mouth of the Yellow River, and gorgeous illustrations of the  art of the period, this book has a few flaws.  The line drawing  reconstruction illos are so dramatic and modern as to convey relatively  little information and some inaccuracies (would someone tell me how those  horses are drawing that chariot, other than with the reins?), and the  cultural coverage of the text is irregular in what it covers if you are  looking for depth.  It takes a couple of readings before the text falls  together, and then suddenly you know a lot about China.  Perservere.

Hyland analyses what is known of Roman cavalry in a manner that will tell  the expert or middling rider a lot, but she needed more summary for the  non-equestrian to make this valuable to her supposed target audience:  the  historian who knows little about horses, and therefor dismisses their role.   She goes over the cavalry display in Arrian in such great detail that,  except for the javelin part, your drill team could set it up.  In the end,  she tells us, yes, the Romans could do just what Arrian describes:  wow,  big surprise.  Only the crown-of-creationists, to whom all previous  cultures must be inferior in all matters including horsemanship, would have  thought otherwise; you know, the sort of people who say, &quot;Even though  this ancient authority says they did such and such, of course they could  not have, being too crude.&quot;  This book is most useful for its  description of the construction details and use of reconstructed Roman  tack, when one feels balanced or overbalanced in which actions, and that  sort of thing.  I also dislike her using her own books so often as an  authoritative reference:  I'd like to know where she got her ideas or  information originally.  Her Medieval Warhorse books are much better.	1998-08-21

However, my recent research,  starting with just looking at how the Middle Ages represents horses, had  convinced me this was not so.  Hyland provided superb support to this idea.   She analyses the size of horse that can go through known openings, the  size of horseshoes from battlefields of the period, and many other pieces  of evidence to show that the early medieval Great Horse was about 15.2  hands high -- often considered small by modern competition riders, who like  16-17 hh Thoroughbreds and warmbloods.  She actually traces horse descent  from the beginning of domestication, though I believe she is too obsessed  with Nesaeans while totally ignoring Scythian contributions to horsemanship  (like the saddle and stirrup).  Other than this, she gives a good if not  impressive picture of the ancient horse as well.  She covers not only the  European warhorse, but its Byzantine and Saracen counterpart and their  riders as well.  It's good reading, not overly technical for the non-rider  but with enough depth for the incurably horsey, too.	1998-08-21

Kearny's book is dead practical on surviving in your house or in a quickly built shelter in the boonies.  No sentimentality here, he points out that older people should do the jobs that risk nuclear contamination, because they are less likely to live to develop cancers from it.  Very good on structures, staying warm (how many layers of newspaper sheets to put under your bathrobe), lots of very clear photos and drawings, and pretty good on cooking, sanitation, and lighting, too.  Just a trifle weak on nutrition, as he does not understand vegetarian protein.  So don't make this the only book you take along.

Rather than just being about female generals, he gets down to the trenches, compiling the evidence for woman warriors among the Steppe tribes of Eurasia, in South America (the reason they called the one river the Amazon) and in Dahomey.  Also, he makes plain the sociological change from the Medieval woman warlord like Aethelflaed of Mercia or Matilda of Tuscany -- a feudal noble defending her turf -- to the modern &quot;Joan of Arc&quot; image, of the idealistic woman of the people fighting out of patriotism.  He does not cover any of the lower-level fighting women of Europe, however, nor the female warlords outside of Europe.	1998-05-27

If anything, in ancient days they may have been just as aggressive and destructive as men, because they were just as powerful.  Certainly, this book made me realise that at any time in history, in almost any culture, there are women who take up arms, whether in wars or barfights, and if a minority, they are not a myth or &quot;a twisted male fantasy.&quot;  This would have been stronger as a history, or at least an encyclopedia arranged by dates rather than alphabet (it has been done).

This points up a basic flaw of the book, that it wanders from one interesting point about equids to another that the author dug up in her researches, without either sticking to a limited or focused thesis, or being really comprehensive.  I don't care what her academic credentials are, she doesn't seem to have actually both read and understood her sources.  She shows the illustrations of ancient traction from Spruytte's *Early Harness Systems* which completely refutes any of LeFebvre's claims of inefficiency based on his phony &quot;ancient traction&quot; system (created to support his thesis on slavery) but then discusses LeFebvre without Spruytte.  She shows a photo from Spruytte's reconstruction of Assyrian mounted archer's reining system, using a weighted tassle on the rein to maintain contact on the bit, and thereafter, to her, every big tassle is part of a similar control system, even when the tassle isn't attached to the reins.  By her writing, she could never be mistaken for a horsewoman, or anyone who has bothered to read a book on horse breeds.  Simply, she claims that the emergence of carriage use &quot;led to demand for well-matched draught horses&quot; and by the mid 1660's &quot;the heavy horse had become established as a breed for use on the land, for haulage, and to carry the nobility in their armour.&quot;  On the contrary, the development of carriages led to a demand for carriage horses, not draft horses, and by the mid 17th C. the nobility wore very little armor *even* just on ceremonial occasions and were riding the proto-Thoroughbreds, not cart horses and plow horses!  If you've read everything else on horses, you may enjoy some of her new bits, like covering the size of ancient and medieval horses based on analysis of bones, but the book best serves as an annotated bibliography to her sources.	1998-05-27

The book was put together to help a rider decide which animal best suits his or her individual usage, but it has a more important historical result.  With his vast collection of quotes from all first-person journals and reports, he demolishes our usually distorted view of the mule in the West as an animal only for the poor or eccentric -- the beasts normally cost 50% more than horses, and was usually in short supply!  I recommend this book to anyone researching the West, researching equid use, or looking for a mount surefooted enough to follow the worst deer tracks in the high mountains and tough enough to do it all day for a week.	1998-05-27

For example, she repeatedly insists that the Scythians had no stirrups.  Then she shows two artifacts that show them with stirrups -- the riders on the terminals of the Kul Oba torque, and horse being hobbled on the Certomylyk amphora.  Very good for compiling ancient reports, and refuting several of them, as when she uses the evidence of excavated skeletons to show that pseudo-Hippocrates' description of little, bloated, yellow men on stumpy horses simply wasn't so, or represents an odd minority.  Read but do not memorize to give you a basis with visuals, then go on to Sulimirski's *The Sarmatians*	1998-05-27

Too much space wasted on showing a system of catagorizing swords which then is never used to show anything.  One of the worst things I've ever seen from Osprey, though still an okay book.  You are better off getting the Elite series #3 on Vikings.	1998-05-27

Still, reading it will help you keep your etiquette straight, as to what was fashionable or unacceptable in the park at various periods, if your interest like mine is social history.  Interesting pictures of period equestrians.	1998-05-27

This subject is obviously the love of his intellectual life, and he has compiled a wonderful study of the development of swords, often being able to match those in art to surviving bits, and the rest of weaponry by the by.  He discusses techniques of use with good sense and practical experiments.  Also, he is one of the few authors to mention that the Vikings were adept at riding and fighting, by his choice of quotes, and explaining the term Riddaraskap.	1998-05-27
