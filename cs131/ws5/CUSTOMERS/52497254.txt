US	52497254	RSVYBT106GCSD	0931674328	891104520	The Next Place	Books	5	57	66	N	N	Perfect for anyone	At the risk of sounding trite, I am using the word \\"pefect\\" to describe this book. It is ecumenical to the point that it can offend no one--not even athiests. I find the term \\"the Next Place\\" better than \\"heaven\\" (and certainly better than hell, because despite what the \\"Left Behind\\" guys think, an all-loving Creator would NOT make people suffer for eternity.)<br /><br />Something happens to us when we die, and no one has come back to tell us what it is. But our \\"spirit,\\" the energy of our thoughts and minds--must go somewhere when our physical body wears out. Hanson does a great job of describing this most indescribable of places (which may not be a place at all, but merely a state of being.)<br /><br />This is the ultimate gift to give to anyone who has suffered a loss (if they haven't gotten it already.) The kind of loss matters not--parent, grandparent, child, even pet--just as the person's faith or secular humanism matters not. When you give this book, you are giving acknowledgement, sympathy, comfort, friendship, or love. Everyone who has suffered loss would gain something from this book.	2005-08-31

I enjoyed the style and pace of the book as well. It was the first book on Roanoke that I've read in some time that had something new to say about one of America's favorite mysteries. I highly recommend it. For your kids that are interested in the Lost Colony, there is a young adult novel called, simply, \\"Roanoke\\" by Levitan. For lovers of fiction, \\"Roanoke\\" by Angela Elwell Hunt is excellent. Could be fun for family discussions or background for a vacation to the area.	2004-10-24

When I was younger, I loved the stories about my favorite players of the day, and the back pages that always had historical statistics. The size is perfect--it's a smaller magazine, about the size of &quot;Prevention&quot; but not as thick. It fits easily inside a notebook or backpack to read during class (shame on me!)As an adult, I love the articles on the history of the game, the &quot;where are they now&quot; features, the quizzes and the letters and stats (still!) I recommend &quot;Hockey Digest,&quot; &quot;Baseball Digest,&quot; and &quot;Football Digest&quot; for anyone who wants a monthly &quot;comfort magazine&quot; about sports. Sure, it's not the deepest reading material in the world. But then again, I think the world is plenty complex and messed up as it is. I don't need my &quot;pleasure reading&quot; adding to those headaches!	2004-01-31

With a comfortable yet scholarly writing style, Mrs. Clinton entertains and educates. Much healthier reading for the soul than the shrieking, apocalypitc howlings of Ann Coulter, Sean Hannity, or Bill O'Reilly. Treat yourself to a book by a visionary--Senator Hillary Clinton--rather than the right wing reactionaries. Visionaries build things, reactionaries only tear down.  Our country would be a lot better off if we had more Hillary Clintons!	2003-06-27

If one were to belive these reviews giving Hillary's book one to two stars, you'd think it's the print version of the movie \\"Plan Nine from Outer Space.\\"  The truth is, this review forum is being \\"freeped,\\" a term used by a very conservative website when they get their members to deluge a poll or something like this review forum to make a liberal politician, writer, or scholar look bad. The truth is, it's simply a very, very loud minority with LOTS of time on their hands to bad-mouth liberals. Don't let their reviews scare you away...I got the book for Father's Day, and Hillary is a brilliant writer and scholar, and a strong, proud, brave woman. Buy, read, and enjoy this book...a nice change of pace from the shrieking harpies Coulter, Hannity and O'Reilly.	2003-06-23

Savage (how ironic--a name that suits the person perfectly) tells us that hate is indeed a family value, while appealing to the most base (and baseless) fears of conservatives.  He gives simple answers to difficult questions, ala Rush, Ann Coulter, and Sean Hannity.  So, if you're looking for someone to blame because your life isn't what you want it to be, this would be a good book with which to start your collection. It'll give you so many different people to hate you won't know where to begin. Happy reading!	2003-01-20

While it may be Christian historical fiction, please don't think that plot and character have been sacrificed.  In fact, Cavanaugh does a superb job of creating characters we really care about, and the plot is anything but predictable.  Plus, all this is happening in front of an historically accurate setting.  It's just nice to sit down with a good book that you know isn't going to surprise you with a lot of unnecessary vulgarity, violence, or sex. I intend to read the entire series.	2001-07-25

This is a balanced, truthful view of the sometimes ridiculous paranoia that runs rampant in the Vatican.  This is perhaps one of the best books on showing the inner workings of the Vatican, as well as being a definitive book on the short papacy of John Paul I.  If you are a progressive Catholic, or one who is comfortable with the human foibles of the clergy, you'll really enjoy this book.  Some Catholic reviewers have screamed &quot;blashphemy&quot; in the past, but truly there is nothing in this book that is sacriligeous.	2001-07-22

Crossan shows us that you can look at the historical Jesus objectively and STILL remain a Christian! If you're a progressive Christian, you will want to read this book.  If you're a person of conservative religious beliefs, save yourself a whole lot of aggravation and find another book on Jesus.	2001-07-08

This book is &quot;a whole lot of Crossan.&quot;  This isn't light reading for the beach...this is heavy-duty scholarship by one of the leading experts in the field of the Jesus Movement.  Crossan leaves no stone unturned, and he anticipates his critics (he answers possible objections to his theories throughout the book).  And even though it is very thorough and scholarly, Crossan's style is very accessible.  One need not be a Ph.D. in theology to understand this book.  &quot;The Birth of Christianity&quot; is highly recommended for liberal Christians, agnostics, and others interested in the historical Jesus Movement.	2001-07-08

Her organization, examples, and practical advice will appeal to writers on both ends of the spectrum and everyone in between.  Like any good teacher, she does not &quot;brow beat&quot; information into you (neither does she insult your intelligence with simplistic advice).  Included are tips on writing all kinds of YA literature...novels, non-fiction, poetry, etc.  She also has a section with practical advice from a business standpoint.  If I could only have one book on writing for young adults, it would be this one (and I've read MANY).	2001-07-08

Burns examines--in depth--the conflicts between Rome and American bishops as well as the role  that the American laity has played throughout it all.  Burns also addresses  the Church in modern Latin America, and concludes with his views on the  future of the Church for liberals and progressives.

Each essay  examines a different issue, such as birth control/abortion, the role of  women in the church, the liturgy and many more.  The essays are academic in  nature yet accessible to all readers in its style and tone.  If you're a  liberal/progressive Catholic and want need some support for when people  attack your views, this book is a must.	2000-05-26

Hunt's research into the mysterious Lost Colony at Roanoke enabled her to produce an outstanding historical novel.  The characters are  deep and complex, and there are plenty of twists and turns in the plot to  keep you turning the pages.  The only &quot;buyer beware&quot; for this  book is that it does have a Christian theme to it, and the faith of the  characters is a major part of the story.  So, if you don't like  Christianity in your fiction, this may not be a book for you.  Otherwise,  enjoy!	2000-05-25

The  brief league and team histories are interesting as well.  However, if you  want more of a flavor of what the league was like beyond the statistics  (much like &quot;Loose Balls&quot;, the book about the ABA), you may be a  little disappointed.  The other drawback is that there are no  &quot;action&quot; photos.  However, the exhaustive statistical history and  amount of interesting trivia make up for the lack of historical depth.	2000-05-23

I taught this book for three years in various seventh and eighth grade classes, and it was the biggest hit with the students of any literature  we'd read.  Students at that age love &quot;the macabre&quot;, and the  Salem Witch Hysteria provides a provocative topic for both the study of  literature and society.  There is plenty of intrigue and just enough  romance in the book to interest both boys and girls.  Incidentally, I  recommend &quot;Three Sovereigns for Sarah&quot; (PBS production starring  Vanessa Redgrave) as a great complimentary movie to the book.	2000-05-05

No, &quot;Liberal Christian&quot; is NOT an oxymoron, thanks to Anne Lamott and &quot;Travelling Mercies&quot;.  This book is a refreshing look  at faith from the point of view of a liberal Christian, one who sees God  and Jesus as loving, understanding, and forgiving. While this book may make  the skin of Conservaitve Christians crawl, it gets to the true essence of  faith, that is, acceptance and love.  Maybe this book will inspire more  liberal Christians to &quot;come out of the woodwork&quot; and tell about  their experiences.
