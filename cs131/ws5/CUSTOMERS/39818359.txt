This book simply blew me away. I never would have believed that A) this could be a true story, or B) that I could enjoy reading non-fiction this much more than I have enjoyed many fiction novels.  <br /> <br />H.H. Holmes has to be one of the most deviously brilliant, yet psychotic serial killers of all time. It is very surprising that he never received the infamous notoriety of someone like Jack the Ripper - who was but a simple slasher by comparison. <br /> <br /> The other side of the storyline was fascinating as well - the 1893 Chicago Columbian World's Expedition (read: World's Fair). The incredible amount of planning to get everything finished as well as all the celebrities and the products and services introduced there that we still have around today is mind-boggling.  <br /> <br />This book is truly fascinating, and cannot be aptly spoken of in such a short review. Highly, highly, HIGHLY recommended. Not only are you entertained, but you take away historical knowledge as well. This book stands out as a true rarity among today's best-sellers.	2004-07-20

Now...she wants control of her own life. <br />I saw tremendous potential in this book, and even felt like it could have been a great story, but the problem I had was that it just never lived up to what I thought it could be. I really felt like the ending was a terrible cop-out so that the author would not have to make a decision that some of her readers wouldn't have liked. Show us the consequences of the girls having to live with their final decision! Also, did every single chapter have to end with an emotional one-liner? \\"Daddy can't go to hell, he'd put out all the fires there.\\" \\"I'm straightening my room now in case I don't come back from the hospital.\\" It would have been really effective if she had done it only 2 or 3 times over the course of the book. Anna is an amazing lead character, but is any 13 year old that smart and that deep as a person (quoting court cases to a lawyer to establish precedence, for example)? Further, I did not need the lawyer/child advocate love story either - rather than add depth to the story, it merely took away from the book's main theme. <br />I did, however, really enjoy the lawyer explaining his service dog (\\"Judge\\") in so many different ways every time he was asked about it. It provided nice and effective comic relief. <br />I wanted to like the novel more and really felt it could have been incredible. I was even pulling for the author to hit me with an amazing ending to put the icing on the cake. I would actually bump this book up to 3.5 stars if I could, but it just never quite made it to greatness level.	2004-06-08

Fair warning - if you are not a fan of historical fiction, you might actually turn into one by the end of this book! The reason is that Silbert has done a masterful job researching and writing the portion of the story involving famous playwright Christopher Marlowe who doubles as one of England's first secret servicemen. So well written is the portion set in the 1590's that you feel you are actually there interacting with the characters.<br />The beauty of the novel is how Silbert takes this centuries old tale and ties it together with a suspenseful present day story while delivering a huge twist at the end. How? Well without giving away anything that you wouldn't read on the dust jacket - the connection lies in a mysterious manuscript uncovered by present day private investigator/CIA undercover operative Kate Morgan. She must discover the origin of the document and what secrets its codes hold, and she must do it quickly...someone is willing to kill to uncover its secrets.<br />Combining suspense, humor (Playwright Marlowe is unimpressed with this \\"new Will Shakespeare fellow\\") drama, and even elements of a love story, this first novel by Leslie Silbert reads as if she has been writing her entire life. Add in quite a few surprising revelations about a few of the main characters and you have a novel that will, by the end, leave you wondering how so much was packed into a relatively short book. Eagerly awaiting her next novel!	2004-05-17

The book originally came out back in 2001, and even then most individuals did not need THAT much explanation about computers to get what was going on (was there really anyone out there in 2001 that had never heard of \\"the internet\\"?). If you know absolutely **nothing** about computers, you might enjoy this novel more but even the most basic computer knowledge turns this book into a bore at times. Readers shouldn't have to keep moaning to themselves \\"yes, I KNOW that, move on!\\"<br />Even with that criticism, when the story did move it was captivating. A hacker sent to prison for cracking the wrong computer system is recruited to help the police catch another hacker that is using his skills to work his way into people's lives and kill them. Great story. If Deaver had focused more on that, he'd have had a real winner here.	2004-04-16

After having read \\"No Second chance\\" - his latest, I was eager to read something else by the talented writer. I was drawn to this book after hearing a few friends tell me that this is his best work and that movie rights had been bought for the story. The talk was not just hype, Coben writes a masterfully suspenseful edge-of-your-seat thriller. It is a fast-paced story that manages to keep you intrigued and guessing for all of its 300+ pages. Let me tell you a few things that may help you make up your own mind about &quot;Tell No One&quot;: <br />Coben grabs your attention from the very first page. You learn in the first chapter that 8 years ago Dr. David Beck was celebrating the anniversary of his wife and his first kiss when she is kidnapped and a few days later found dead. During the kidnapping David is beaten and left for dead. Flash forward to present day - after 8 years something happens to shift the reality of what may have really happened that night. Is his wife really dead? The reader is hooked and the story does let go until the thrilling (and surprising) conclusion. <br />Coben combines characters that are cops, FBI, drug dealers, and mafia hitmen and does it all masterfully. Pick this book up and you likely won't be able to put it back down until it's over. It's a very entertaining read by a very talented author.	2004-03-04

It's a very fast-paced story, and definitely keeps you entertained for all of its 300+ pages. Here are some thoughts to help you make up your own mind.<br />Though this is I think the sixth book in the series with his main character Stone Barrington, I did not feel at a loss at all for not having read the first few. That alone impressed me, but then add on top of that a story that grabs you and does let go. <br />Unfortunately, of the ones I have read, this one seemed the least plausible. A real suspension of disbelief is required while reading. While I usually have no problem with that, I don't want to recognize while reading that I am having a difficult time thinking the story is realistic.<br />Still, it is a fun read if you take it with a grain of salt and just allow yourself to be entertained by it.

It's not supposed to change your life, it's just a lot of suspense and loads of fun. Joseph Finder has done a great job of writing with Paranoia. It is an incredibly fast-paced non-stop action adventure that has you turning pages so fast you can feel the breeze on your face! The suspense throughout the book is so thick you can cut it with a dull butter-knife. Here are some things that will help you make up your own mind about Paranoia:<br />Most novels take a while building up characters before the action begins. Finder grabs you from the first page with Paranoia as the main character finds himself in very hot water after siphoning off company funds for personal use. Rather than fire and prosecute him, the CEO decides to use him as a pawn in a dangerous game of corporate espionage. Close call after close call ensues (think \\"Alias\\" the TV show but in a corporate environment) as he tries to balance not getting caught and sent to jail by either company he's involved with. The beauty is that you, the reader, do not know what the reality of the situation is until the last 10 pages of the story. Is the main character paranoid or is everyone really out to get him?<br />If you enjoy suspense thrillers like those of John Grisham or Dan Brown, then you are sure to get caught up in the thrill ride from the beginning. It is one of those books you pick up and just don't want to put down until its exciting (and surprising!) conclusion.	2004-02-27

Mystic River is an incredible tale of friendship, betrayal, and the psychological repercussions of events we may think we have left in the past - but in fact continue to haunt into the future. I found the book to be deeply moving and thought-provoking as well. Here are a few things that may help you make up your own mind if you are considering reading it (NO spoilers you wouldn't read about on the book jacket):<br />Dennis Lahane steps away from his typical novel centering on a male-female detective team to write a story of three childhood friends growing up in a run-down part of Boston. The story begins with the main characters as 11-year old kids. A strange car pulls onto the street where they are hanging out and something happens to change to lives of the boys forever.<br />Flash forward to present day, with the three characters now in their late 30's. One has become a cop, one is an ex-con, and the third is simply trying to live a \\"normal\\" existence while battling the demons of that horrid day when the boys were 11.  One tragic night the ex-con's daughter is found dead, the cop is sent to investigate, and one of the three can't explain where all the blood on his clothes and in his car has come from.<br />The story may seem straightforward, but not all is as it seems, and that is another thing that makes the book great. You get a glimpse into the lives of each of the three. You try to understand what they must be going through as the events unfold.<br />You never see the end coming.	2004-01-13

It's pretty well known that The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time is the story of an 15 year old autistic boy seeking to solve the &quot;mystery&quot; of who has murdered the beloved dog of a neighbor.<br />What is not as well known and something you should consider as you begin to read is that this book is told from the perspective of the 15-year-old child, not a neutral narrator. It is the main character of the novel that is telling you his story. At first it may be difficult to get into the flow of the story because you must first become used to the fact that the narration is firstly very detailed and logical, and secondly very prone to going off on tangents that have little to do with the main plot of the book.<br />However, it is this different style of writing that gives the book its authenticity and makes it a joy to read. The author himself is not autistic, but he captures both the patterns of logical and detail-oriented thinking, as well as the random tangents into comfortable territory (for the child), and gives the reader the feel that they are being told the story first hand.<br />Not only does the story present a very interesting plot with twists and turns and unexpected results, but it also educates us as to just how brilliant are the minds and touching are the lives of autistic people.<br />If you enjoy easy to read fiction that can both educate and entertain simultaneously, the you will like this book. Give yourself time to adjust to the different story-telling method and you'll feel great about the experience.	2003-12-17

The main character Neely Crenshaw is a former star quarterback and must battle his own demons to figure out how to pay homage to his former coach.

Dead Ringer caught me off guard because I frankly did not expect a lot from it. Boy was I surprised when I discovered that this is an incredible legal thriller that rivals many of Grisham's books! Take any recent Grisham novel of choice, make all his legal-professional characters female, add some actual depth to his recent one-dimensional characters, and presto - Dead Ringer!<br />Bennie Rosato, head of her own small law firm composed entirely of female professionals (lawyers and scretaries), is the main character of the book. The main plot revolves around how her twin sister almost destroys her life by trying to assume her identity when Bennie's wallet is lost. However, that is only the main plot. The depth of character development is enthralling as we learn of Bennie's struggles to maintain a financially depleted firm, make contact with a long lost father, develop a new relationship with a guy, and attempt to win a huge class-action lawsuit. Wow!<br />If you are a fan of legal thrillers like Grisham writes, you will love this book. GUYS NOTE - yes, many of the main characters are female, and it is an all-woman firm. However, there is no man-bashing or overly sappy text. As stated before, its like a Grisham novel with female lead characters. This is a quality novel that I thoroughly enjoyed and so will you, no matter what age or gender!	2003-12-04

Especially since her father is the President's opponent in the upcoming election. One of the biggest discoveries in the history of man has been made (or has it?) - something so big it overshadows the election itself.<br />Rachel must battle to find the truth in spite of being hunted by an unknown team of assassins who are controlled by a shadowy figure in Washington. A figure who will do anything to keep the truth from coming out. She must also battle her own internal demons in a tug of war between loyalty to her manipulative father and the person she believes should win the Presidency.<br />If you are a fan of action-packed conspiracy thrillers, this is the book for you.

When she finds out he is being used as a pawn in a government conspiracy involving her own boss (who secretly pines for her attention) all hell is about to break loose.

Maybe I am spoiled, but I felt like this latest addition to the Alex Cross series was poorly written in comparison to both earlier Patterson novels and other authors in general. The story itself was entertaining enough, although the \\"surprise ending\\" ending where you discover the identity of the fourth blind mouse kind of left the reader scratching his head and wonder - \\"wait, who was this guy again?\\" One other thing - Alex Cross has a new girlfriend - I get it. He is falling in love - I get it. I am not opposed to sex scenes per se, but did I need to know every graphic detail of Alex's bedroom time? Umm, no. It's almost as if those scenes were in there because he knew the story was getting old and he needed to do something to keep the reader's interest. Love scenes should compliment a story line, not be used to try to save it from drowning. 3 stars, but only because I can't give it 2 1/2.	2003-11-18

Incredibly fun read from Dan Brown that once again brings back the main character Robert Langdon from his previous work, \\"Angels & Demons\\". This time Langdon must figure out the mysteries of a secret society before some of mankind's greatest truths are lost forever.<br />The story begins with the assassination of the curator of the Louvre, one of the most famous museums in the world. Langdon is called in by the police and the daughter of the murdered man to assemble and decode the clues left by the curator within some of Leonardo Da Vinci's greatest works.<br />From there the reader is taken on a non-stop thrill ride as the men behind the assassination come after Langdon while he also attempts to flee the authorities that have named him as the primary suspect in the murder case. It is not difficult to see why this book has remained on Amazon's Top 10 best-seller list for months and months now. It is a fun read that makes you really think while you are being entertained. I can't wait for the next installment in the Langdon series. Enjoy this great read for yourself!	2003-11-18

From Dan Brown comes the story that started it all - introducing us to his main character Robert Langdon who will appear again in each of his next two books \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" and a new one to be released early next year. A fast-paced fun read in which Langdon must figure out a mystery surrounding a new scientific discovery and how it has the potential to prove the existence of God. The truth could change religion (most notably the Catholic Church) forever. <br />The story begins with the assassination of a scientist at one of the greatest think-tanks in Europe where an incredible discovery rocks the very foundations of religion and science.  Langdon is called in due to his immense knowledge of symbology - the calling card of the assassins.<br />From there the reader is taken on a non-stop thrill ride as the men behind the assassination go after key leaders in the Catholic Church who are next in line to possibly become Pope. Langdon becomes a target himself while attempting to solve the symbology behind the killings. It is not difficult to see why this book has remained on Amazon's Top 100 best-seller list for months now. It is a fun read that makes you really think while you are being entertained. I can't wait for the next installment in the Langdon series. Enjoy this great read for yourself!	2003-11-18
US	39818359	R2OCKLJUF8TKK	0375726403	340719393	Empire Falls	Books	5	1	1	N	N	Excellence in storytelling	Empire Falls shows the masterful story-telling capabilities of Richard Russo as he richly depicts the life of a single parent raising a young girl amidst a small dying town in the northeastern US. The main character runs a small diner with a few loyal customers (not all of whom he is glad are loyal customers). Russo writes in such a way as to make the reader feel they are a part of the town rather than a viewer of events from the outside.<br />Similar to George Bailey from \\"It's a Wonderful Life\\" the protagonist had always dreamed of leaving the small town of Empire Falls for college and bigger dreams elsewhere, but was never able to make it. Now he dreams of a better life for his daughter and will do almost anything to give it to her. There is a darker side to the story however, that is not at all similar to the aforementioned movie.<br />As the protagonist continues to battle with the people and the inner demons from his past, his daughter is confronted with a dark new presence in her school. A presence which is not at all as it seems and provides for amazingly horrifying events to transpire and for real life-changing lessons to be learned in the end.<br />It is easy to see how such an amazing story - told so amazingly well - could have won the Pulitzer Prize for fiction. Do yourself a favor and read this book, you'll be very glad you did.	2003-11-18
US	39818359	R2NEDKJVWF0D58	0802130208	161411385	A Confederacy of Dunces	Books	5	1	2	N	N	A comedic masterpiece	What can one say about this book that would do it justice? It is simply one of the funniest, most well written pieces of comedic literature to date. Words cannot really describe it, you simply MUST purchase and read this book today. It is rare that a book can make you laugh out loud, but this book will do it over and over again.<br />The main character of the book is a slacker who is everything but that to himself. He brings to life the phrase \\"a legend in his own mind\\". Thirty-something years old, living at home with his mother, unable to hold a job longer than a week, he continues to make excuses and get himself into more messes than one could imagine.<br />The only tragedy about the book is the author's own. Not knowing that his work would go on to become critically acclaimed Pulitzer Prize winning material, he committed suicide before he had a chance to experience his own success. I could not help but laugh as I read the book, but be saddened upon finishing that the world will not be able to experience more works from a true writing genius.	2003-11-18

Michael Crichton renews his claim as one of the best fiction writers of our time with this thrilling tale of a group of archeologists and scientists who look for answers to a present-day problem in the distant past.<br />When a group of young scientists and graduate students find a note that appears to be from their leader asking for help, they are shocked. They are floored when it appears as if the note is over 600 years old. Soon they find that a corporate sponsor of the expedition has discovered a way to travel through time and they must embark on a terrifying rescue mission - which takes them on a journey into the distant past.<br />The story has every opportunity to turn into a hokey mess, but Crichton avoids the pitfalls at every turn and ends up with one of his best novels to date. If you plan to see the movie, read the book first, you will be so glad you did. An all-around good read.	2003-11-17

I may be spoiled after having read Timeline by him, but this one didn't quite show off his usual writing genius.<br />No spoilers here, but think of this book as Jurassic Park on the microscopic level. The main group of characters is trapped in a secluded area. If caught, they'll be killed by the predator. How can they get away? Does this entire plot sound familiar?<br />Crichton appears to be writing a screenplay in book form in order to re-capitalize on the Jurassic Park popularity of former years. Sure it is fun and entertaining, but I was hoping for something a little more original.	2003-11-17

Outstanding novel told from the aspect of the main character flashing back on pertinent events in his lifetime that have led up to his current crisis. Told in a similar style to John Irving's \\"A Prayer for Owen Meany\\", yet immensely easier to read. The plot flows more smoothly and maintains your interest throughout.<br />The story begins like your average detective/crime novel, but quickly becomes a flashback story as the main character - in attempt to write a confession - tells the story of his life and the life of the dead body discovered by police.<br />The title of the book comes from the old saying: \\"In the Land of the Blind, the One-Eyed Man rules all.\\" The author manages to incorporate the saying into the story in a way that will startle and move the reader. An outstanding effort with twists and turns around every corner.	2003-11-17

It's a very fast-paced story that somehow manages to keep you on a thrill ride for almost all of its 300+ pages.<br />Though this is the fifth or sixth book in a series with his main character Stone Barrington, I did not feel at a loss at all for not having read any of his previous books. That alone impressed me, but then add on top of that a story that grabs you and does let go until the thrilling conclusion.<br />Woods combines characters that are cops, ex-cops, lawyers, British intelligence, and international assassins and does it all masterfully. Pick this book up and you likely won't be able to put it back down until its over.	2003-11-14

Tom Robbins, in his own quirky, psychedelic style attempts to share with his readers his purpose for the moon, as well as how (if it is possible at all) to make love stay. The book tells an interesting tale, but bogs down a bit in overanalyzing itself. <br />A deposed royal family takes up residence in the Seattle-area under the watchful eye of the CIA. The young daughter, a princess mind you, takes up with an \\"outlaw\\" bomber. I'm the first to admit it's a very interesting premise for a story.<br />And interesting it is, until we get bogged down in an extremely long drawn out page after page analysis of pyramids and whether or not redheads are actually descendants from an alien race. Even still, I can appreciate Robbins writing style and story-telling capabilities. Robbins isn't for everyone, and if you have not read him before, I would not suggest starting with this one. However, the book does overcome itself to turn into a fun read by the end.	2003-11-12
US	39818359	RMIN4Y994UH7E	0451191145	604964480	Atlas Shrugged	Books	5	10	15	N	N	A masterpiece of both fiction and philosophy	It doesn't matter how you look at it - as a piece of literature or as a philosophy on life - either way it is truly a work of art. No wonder this book has been talked about for decades. I had never read such a lengthy novel before (and my only qualm with the book is that it truly could have been shorter without losing any impact) but I was incredibly glad I did read this one by the time I was finished.<br />The protagonist is quite inspirational on many levels. Overcoming incredible odds in her job, her family, her life in general. The theme of the story has truth that will never get old or outdated.<br />Pick up this book and stay with it through the end. It's amazing, and you will be so glad you did.	2003-11-04

I think it would have been a very interesting 250-ish page book. Why did we have to read 20 entries to a contest she didn't even win? Character development was good for the main character, but not so good for the rest of the family. I could not remember who was who for the &quot;where are they now&quot; section about the kids at the end.	2003-10-28

Something that seemed conspicuously absent was mistakes he made and how he might have become a better leader by learning from them. His inside look at the tragedy of Sept 11 was very interesting and brought back a lot of memories and emotions. Thoroughly enjoyed reading about the recovery efforts.	2003-10-28

Having read quite a few books in this genre, I can say that while the book was not bad, it also didn't really provide anything special for the reader that he could not have gotten from a dozen other crime novels. I will give the author credit for developing the characters well, and I found the single-bullet theory to be interesting as well. Other books in this series are better, don't start with this one.	2003-10-28

I did think it was odd that the boy's views on religion were more enlightened than many scholars. The story of his survival at sea was captivating. I particularly enjoyed the ending to the story which left the reader scratching his or her head and wondering what the real story was after all.	2003-10-28

I enjoyed the bittersweet ending, although the final resolution of the plot line with the killer was a bit unfulfilling. Even that kept the realism of the story - everything in life does not wrap up with a neat little bow. My one issue lies in the fact that the story was more of a stream of consciousness rather than a story, and after thinking long and hard, I was left with a bit of a hollow feeling that there was not a lesson to be taken away. I still give high marks to the author for an incredibly well-written story.	2003-10-28

A little hard to get into, and once the story develops the plot does not get much better. I kept wanted to yell at the parents to get over themselves and get on with life. Losing a loved one - esepcially a child - is tragic, but eventually life has to go on. Frustrating in that the solution to happiness was so close (the parents could have come home, Lucy could have married her dream guy) and yet it seemed the author did not want his characters happy. Even after the reunion, the story leaves the reader feeling incomplete at the end.	2003-10-28

Unfortunately for the average reader it may not be worth the incredible amount of time required to digest the entire story.	2003-10-28

What a touching story that's really hard to put down. The story really makes you re-examine your assumptions about the people in your life - you really may not know everything you think you do. The only negative thing I can say is that it ended too quickly. Highly recommended, one of the few books that you'll read again and again.	2003-10-27

Yes, this reveiw is harsh, and I actually am a Patterson fan - of the Alex Cross series anyway.

The book is simply terrible, probably in my bottom 5 ever.<br />The story is totally unrealistic - even more so than its predecessor &quot;When the Wind Blows&quot; - from the opening custody battle to the ridiculous plot thereafter. The writing style is VERY simplistic. There must have been hundreds of paragraphs consisting of three words or less. The sad part is that is not an exaggeration.<br />I am praying that the Alex Cross book coming out soon will signal the return of the writer we know is still in there somewhere. Save yourself the time and just say no to this book.	2003-09-26
