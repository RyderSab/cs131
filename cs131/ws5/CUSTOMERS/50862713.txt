So many of our &quot;friends&quot; and &quot;allies&quot; are enemies of another, less obvious stripe. Gibson uncovers the anti-American policies and hidden political agendas of France, Germany, and the most of the EU, South Korea, and Canada.

Fair enough. I personally did not care for the selective history exercised in several of the passages, including the only-in-passing reference to other groups persecuted (\\"20,000 gypsies\\" is all that is mentioned, when there were in reality millions of gypsies, Catholics, Communists, homosexuals, mentally & physically handicapped and others exterminated), and some stinging criticism of the rest of the world for passively ignoring the situation (omitting some of history's most courageous and altruistic efforts, such as the evacuation of the nation's Jews by the people of Denmark). Read carefully first, then use your own judgement about what to share and what to revise for your own children. Selective or revisionist history is, after all, what books like this are supposed to be fighting against.	2002-11-15

This was the period when rock &amp; roll was transforming into rock, when new groups and sounds were a weekly happening, and the rock album was asserting its place in the market. It is fascinating to read the articles, reviews, and interviews by some of rock music's future premier writers such as editor/publisher Paul Williams, Jon Landau, Richard Meltzer, and Ed Ward, and to relive the history of the music in the reprinted news items and record release notices. Fans of rock history and pop music journalism will enjoy this long-overdue celebration of the orgin of the form.	2002-09-28

Year-by-year results are presented, followed by season and career batting and pitching records, and the lifetime records of a number of outstanding players from yesterday and today. The only problem is, who says souped-up, steroid-fed 1996-2001 ought to be the standard? Essentially what results are beefed-up home run and strikeout totals, somewhat depressed batting averages, and much-inflated earned run averages. There is also some liberty taken in having each league divided into two divisions from 1901, three divisions from 1969, and so on, with a corresponding playoff system each year. Still, this sort of alternate history can be fun, especially in baseball, and the presentation is easy and fun to pore over. Sure to spark debate, and that's something baseball fans love almost as much as the game itself.	2002-08-25

Again, though, I've given this must-have book four stars for one striking omission. Smith does identify every tune to reach Chicago's WLS weekly music survey through the end of the charts in mid-1990 by title and artist, along with the debut and peak dates, highest position reached and weeks on the survey, along with the top songs of each year and the entire decade. What is missing is a listing of the number ones week-by-week or at the very least some indication of how many weeks a given number one hit spent at the top. Still, this is an essential reference for those whose interest in the charts extends beyond merely the national Hot 100. Here's hoping that some other people with access to source material get the same idea and do similar works on some of the other regional markets.	2002-08-10

It's only too bad the period covered is so short (these charts only began in 1975). For data prior to this volume you'd be advised to seek out data from Toronto's CHUM charts (the book is out of print but the data can be found on the Web). Overall, Canada's chart hits differ only in minor ways from those of the U.S., but there are some interesting oddities and some native favorites to be found. Lwin's book is a top reference source for chart buffs and music hobbyists.	2002-05-21

NZ and Australian artists fare better in these charts than they generally do elsewhere, but major US and UK artists certainly show up in strength. The book is perhaps unecessarily large in size and the weekly number one list at the back could have been laid out more felicitously, but I won't quibble about that. I do dock it a star for ethnic chauvinism, though (the author, in the foreward, calls the US and UK charts &quot;a joke&quot; : not very sporting, mate).	2002-05-20

This book does much to address that gap. A presentation of 600 Top 20 monthly popularity charts, running from January 1900 to December 1949, makes up the main portion of the book. Another section of the book displays these charts in a spreadsheet format so one can see each song's rise and fall in popularity. Of course, one researcher's opinion cannot be definitive, but his methods are described and justified in some detail and the results seem as accurate as we can hope to expect. Joel Whitburn's &quot;Pop Memories&quot;, also highly recommended, covers similar ground with extraordinary detail, covering commercially-available phonograph records. Each of these books complements the other. Popular music historians and chart buffs should have both of these excellent books. Note : there are several references in &quot;Popular Songs of the 20th Century&quot; to a Volume II, covering the rest of the 20th century, which seems not have been published yet. I'm looking forward to it.	2002-05-20

A jarring leap from 1870 to 1915, just the period when bats were developing from wagon tongues to modern bats, is unforgiveable.

Joe photos	Plenty of useful and interesting information here, but the real appeal is the generous collection of photographs of vintage Joes and equipment in their natural element : on bivouac, at sea, ready to roll. These are the kind of set-ups that used to make me salivate as a kid and it's fun to revisit via this book.	2002-03-11

Derived mostly from new interviews with each of the band members, the book is almost exclusively about the four or five years the group were intact and gives detailed descriptions of the writing and recording of their music and touring life. It's not a great book, but it is quite good, and I appreciate the almost scholarly approach to their music rather than the gushing idol-worship of so many other rock biographies. The hefty contributions of the band members to the book make this almost autobiographical. There are a few illustrations in the center of the book. Altogether a very fine gift for Zombies fans and British beat historians.	2002-03-03

Smith does identify every tune to reach Chicago's WLS weekly music survey by title and artist, along with the debut and peak dates, highest position reached and weeks on the survey, along with the top songs of each year and the entire decade. There is also a section collecting the data from the WLS R&amp;B chart that ran for a few months in late 1964. What is missing is a listing of the number ones week-by-week or at the very least some indication of how many weeks a given number one hit spent at the top. Still, this is an essential reference for those whose interest in the charts extends beyond merely the national Hot 100. I hope Mr. Smith puts out a 1980s volume to go along with this volume and the companion 1970s volume, and that some other people with access to source material get the same idea and do similar works on some of the other regional markets.	2002-02-08

Pepper's...&quot;), and its muted reception in 1966 and its place today in the pantheon of pop music. Highly readable, with loads of details on the writing and recording of tracks and the contributions of the musicians who played on the recording. Illustrations include such memorabilia as the musician's union payroll sheets for the sessions. Reading the book makes one want to pull out the album and listen again and again. High praise, indeed.	2002-02-02

Smith does identify every tune to reach Chicago's WLS weekly music survey by title and artist, along with the debut and peak dates, highest position reached and weeks on the survey, along with the top songs of each year and the entire decade, as well as the top 89 artists of the 70s.

Knowing little of Mr. Brett other than his Holmes role and some films like &quot;My Fair Lady&quot;, in which he played Freddy, there was much of interest here, from his childhood and youth, life as a young actor and with his wife and son, and his lifelong struggle with manic-depression and his own bisexuality. About half the book deals with his Holmes-era life and his love/hate relationship with the role that made him most famous. Well recommended for fans of Mr. Brett and Holmes afficionados.	2002-01-26

The thin (48 pages) paperback features photos (most of which can be found elsewhere) with captions seemingly written for grade schoolers and little else. There is no particular point of view (other than tragic loss) and the whole thing looks like it was cobbled together in less than an hour. You'll be better satisfied with any of the other books on the market, and, in particular, &quot;One Nation&quot; featuring the photographs of Life photographers or the volume of photos by Magnum photographers.	2001-12-16

As a children's librarian, I have been recommending this book for decades. The plot is both intimate (concerning the love of a father and son and the quest to become self-winding) and epic at the same time. Like the best novels, the events and elements of the story are not mere contrivances but deeply intertwined threads that provide motive and propel the story along. This new edition features charming illustrations that both capture the mood of the story and add dimension. A wonderful coupling, and so nice to have this classic available again.	2001-12-16

The coverage is not just limited to the WTC, but Washington and Pennsylvania as well - the whole nation, in fact. Truly as inspiring as it is horrifying. There have been numerous books already on this subject but this one looks like its going to be the definitive volume to keep.	2001-12-02

The pictures don't just capture the obvious Hudson River-view of the Twin Towers but the courtyards, the corridors, the shops, and the observation deck and visitor's center. There is coverage of the 1993 bombing, the 1974 &quot;Human Fly&quot; episode, the late-'70's tightrope walk between the Towers, and, of course, 1976's &quot;King Kong&quot; filming -- everything that made the WTC an essential part of the Big Apple. A nice tribute to a never-to-be-forgotten landmark.	2001-11-24

This is not a collection of photos of the 9/11 tragedies, per se, but a collection of 9/12 newspaper front pages from nearly all the major US dailies, the biggest national papers (USA Today, WSJ, Christian Science Monitor), plus several major newspapers from around the world. Horrible as the events of that day were, it is interesting (and revelatory in some cases) to see how the events were covered. Obviously the NYC and Washington newspapers had a special closeness to the events but there is plenty to learn from reviewing the coverage in distant  cities and small towns across North America, by US allies and traditionally non-allied nations (and even a few enemy states), and of editorial decisions about headline phrasing and photo selection. In a way, a book like this makes a case, for better or worse, for the world as global village. Not for the feint-hearted, perhaps, but an interesting collection and certainly worth preserving.	2001-11-14

Yes, the photographs are beautifully composed and quite striking, the text good if occaisionally flowery. The interspersion of 9/11 photos are what I could do without. My memories of the WTC are of gleaming towers of strength and pride, not smoking husks. Some readers will find their memories reflected in these pages, some will not. Consider how you wish to remember the WTC before you select a photo tribute book.	2001-11-11

Most of the photos (all in color) were taken in the August 2001 and are supplemented with some descriptive text. A few photos are included of the WTC's construction. The 2001 photos show the towers from nearly every conceivable angle and vantage point in and around Manhattan, but a more thorough tribute would have included some photos of the interior of the towers, the plaza in between, and probably a few views from the observation deck. Still, it's hard to be overly critical right now and the price is pleasantly non-exploitative.	2001-11-10

Many, many early Lil' Folks and Peanuts strips (including a rare 1954 strip with adults that Schulz never permitted to be reprinted), alongside some interesting commentary from Schulz himself and others.

I don't know if I agree with all of Pinsky's interpretations (and sometimes he can beat a plotline to death), but I do agree that there is a moral heart and a spiritual sympathy to the program that is generally missed by its detractors. The Simpsons often skewers organized religion to amusing effect, but anti-Simpsons often fail to see the real message behind the satire. There's a parallel between this book and the old &quot;Gospel According to Peanuts&quot; book, although I think the religious message in Peanuts was always more overt. Not an essential book, but diverting for Simpsons fans nonetheless and recommended.	2001-10-19

There is a (mostly negligible) plot carried through the diary entries of Watson, but the real interest comes in the chronicled circumstances of the &quot;real&quot; cases behind the famous stories of the Canon, Watson's difficulties in pleasing his publisher and Holmes, and Holmes' &quot;true&quot; character and adventures.

Some of the facts of Steve Martin's early days are interesting, but the thread gets lost once Martin becomes famous. You can sense his (Martin's) moving beyond Walker's circle (probably for good reason), and a suggestion of Walker's need to hang on. There is a very interesting book waiting to be written about this gifted and brilliant comedian/actor/writer, but this is definitely not that book.	2001-06-13

Bob Dylan, of course, is another story, but rarely has he been cast in such an all-too-human light. Most highly recommended to fans of Dylan and Baez, and to those initiates who want to learn more about the highwater era of American folk music.	2001-05-03

A great book on the Rolling Stones, following their complete story song-by-song chronologically over each album to date. The information (often quite fascinating and new even to longtime Stones fans) has been provided by first-hand participants : musicians, producers, engineers, and the Stones themselves. Great photos (mostly color) complete the package. Songs not on original LPs are presented in chronological order in the last section. A terrific browser or read-through. The best Stones-related book in a long, long time and absolutely essential!	2001-04-05

The book has great reference value. The text, though, is fairly wooden : useful but gracelessly flat - a real disappointment considering the colorful and often dramatic subject matter. Still, a highly recommended purchase for all baseball fans, not just historians.	2001-03-30

Features all the famous (and infamous) sports figures and events you remember, and plenty of Gallo's beloved characters like Basement Bertha, Yutchie, and General Von Steingrabber.

The details and discussions are drawn directly from the original Holmes stories and features none of the unfounded or fanciful speculations that clog so many other Holmes &quot;biographies&quot;. Thomson does offer other scholars' differing or dissenting opinions and interpretations, conjectures, and so on, where appropriate for a well-rounded text. The writing style is excellent and eminently readable, avoiding the dry scholarly style of some other studies. Well documented and footnoted, this is almost as entertaining to read as the actual Holmes stories themselves. Highly recommended.	2001-02-14

An article about the awards and nominations for each year accompanies the listings. The articles are not especially well written, containing as they do several irritating factual errors, but for the most part its the listings that are the focus of this book and they're just what they should be. Coverage of some Grammy controversies is interesting and probably could make an interesting book of their own. Recommended.	2000-12-26

It is very interesting to read the thoughts and observations (liberally quoted in the idiosyncratic spelling of the era) of the first encounters with people, animals, and plants of the Americas. The illustrations are from the period, though one might wish for a few modern maps to help illustrate the wanderings of some of these explorers. There are a few well-known explorers omitted, but that does not detract from what is included. Still, those who enjoy their history first-hand, and especially those interested in the natural history of North America, will find this book compelling reading.	2000-12-06

The book consists predominantly of b/w and sepia photographs of the teams, fields, and fans associated with the long and interesting history of baseball in Tampa, St. Petersburg, and Clearwater. The photographs are excellent, but I am among those who would have liked some of that rich history in text.	2000-12-06

Entries include artist, title, catalog no., chart date, and week-by-week position on the chart. A section at the back shows the number one entries for each week. You won't find any information on the artists themselves, but this is worthwhile resource for record collectors, discographers, and chart fanatics. That said, the book is disappointing overall due to the scattershot selection of the charts covered (does anybody really care about the video games chart?) and the lack of coverage of some the more important charts (albums, singles - covered in the authors' other volumes through 1985 and 1981 respectively). Recommended as an addition to the Joel Whitburn Billboard books but definitely not as a substitute.	2000-12-02

Fans of Burke's previous books (such as myself) will find this another fine, idiosyncratic volume of &quot;connections&quot;, following the threads of science, technology, and discovery; the uninitiated may find this one, with its smaller and less dramatic scope, less appealing than &quot;Connections&quot; or &quot;The Day the Universe Changed&quot; or even &quot;The Pinball Effect&quot;.

The book's strength (and it's considerable) is its glut of color photos, which chronicle everything from restaurant and resort architecture to barware, film, and graphic design. The text (on the history - mostly the 1940s through the early 1960s - of Tiki culture and notable Tiki people and places, such as Trader Vic's) is good, although scattered about the book in a busy layout, and printed side-by-side in English, French, and German. I might have wished for a bit more text and a cleaner layout, but as the book quotes Picasso, &quot;Good taste marks the death of creativity&quot;.	2000-10-07

A wonderfully charming and moving series of memories, observations, and poetic passages about a childhood at turns sweet, innocent, and difficult. Sometimes children make the most clear-eyed  and wise observers, and it is the rare adult, such as June Jordan, who can  recapture and communicate the experience of childhood in both its wonder  and bewilderment. Although the elements of Jordan's childhood are specific  - 19302/1940s, brusque, occaisionally-violent immigrant father, Harlem and  Brooklyn neighborhoods, racial and social inequity - the themes are  universal.

Hundreds of biographical sketches, photographs (portraits), detailed club histories,  statistics (almost quaint in its early-1900's point of view : pitching  leaders by winning pct., for example; no discussion of e.r.a., home run  records, etc.). Plenty of boxscores from important games dating back to the  1830's and every &quot;world series&quot; from the 1880's on.
