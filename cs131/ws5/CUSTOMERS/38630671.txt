A darn good one.	I have tried several other similar learn Spanish CDs (see all of my relatively recent reviews) and this product is head and shoulders above the rest. It is the only one you need.<br />If you don't skip any CDs and you don't cheat yourself by getting ahead of yourself too quickly, after listening to all of the 8 CDs (at least twice each) you WILL have a rudimentary ability to communicate in Spanish.  This happens by constructing your own unique phrases -and I think- in the shortest possible time with this language dynamics course. I'm talking about expressing yourself with sentences such as: ¨the key to my heart...¨ or ¨you have the most beautiful lips in the world¨.<br />I feel confident enough now to speak what I know. I get by without feeling like a complete idiot. Sometimes I even get compliments on my spanish.<br />In comparison, the Pimsleur method was too slow for me. But don't kid yourself. It is still a slow and sometimes tedious process. Sometimes it can be frustrating and at other times it can be very rewarding. Just be aware that it ain't no where near as easy or as quick as plugging in a new RAM chip in your computer.<br /><br />HOW IT WORKS:<br /><br />There is a pause just after the English word or phrase is spoken, and then Louis repeats it twice in Spanish with a slight pause inbetween. The trick is to think of how to say the equivalent English phrase but IN SPANISH and say it aloud before Louis says it the first time. So when you get better at it, you're repeating each phrase three times. The American host occasionally reminds you to stop the tape (although it is the CD version) if necessary, rewind and repeat the sections until you know them thoroughly. After you improve by listening to the CD a few times there is no need to pause the CD at the pause between the English and the Spanish.<br /><br />WHAT IS MORE IMPORTANT- recalling a load of phrases memorised verbatim OR being able to ask questions in Spanish such as: ¨what is that¨ and ¨how do you say `XYZ' in spanish¨, knowing the answer and being able to respond again? One method is a self-correcting learning process and the other is not. This is the sort of program that will teach you the method that takes advantage of the way humans learn new things + interact. It is called communication. The other way (that most other programs seem to go with) is boring & tedious & reminds me of programming a computer... it is for dummies and it doesn't allow you to invisage new situations and construct totally new phrases when the need arises, etc.<br /><br />LIKES:<br />There is also some light humour, which is good. The native Spanish speaker, Louis, is VERY good at pronouncing all the words clearly and at the right pace. The enlglish speaker, an American, is also good and I find him pleasing enough to listen to. Now and then he praises YOU the listener + learner. I like that. Encouragement is very important.<br /><br />What I also liked is that most of the material I came across in everyday situations during my 3 weeks stay in the Canary Islands. Sometimes it was uncanny. I'd learn several new words on the very same day I was exposed to them out on the street. Sometimes within hours of hearing or seeing the words. Furthermore, it has a very good balance of learning new material and reviewing old material in different ways. It doesn't teach you tons and tons of vocabulary, but now I can always point and ask: ¨What is that thing called?¨<br />Get the idea now?<br /><br />I think this program provides the most painless introduction to Spanish. It isn't that difficult. But practise and perseverance are of paramount importance. I am currently staying in Tenerife (which is a Spanish-speaking island off the coast of Morocco) with a few relatives. Luckily for me, the dialect here is more like that of South America. I.e. they pronounce ¨z¨ as ¨s¨not ¨th¨. This is the same as what the program teaches. Although they do cover a few words that differ between mainland Spain and South America.<br /><br />DISLIKES:<br />The only thing that I was slightly miffed about is that NO ONE seems to use the more polite ¨Usted¨ form of Spanish any more. Apparantly it is like the equivalent of talking like Shakespeare did 400 years ago. It sounds quaint to them and so it seems like a waste of time learning it to me.<br /><br />There are also some very small mistakes, eg a few times, the Spanish isn't repeated twice (etc) where it should be. Hopefully if they make another version these very minor gripes will be sorted out. It's still 110% worth the money though.<br />[...]<br />___________<br />Muchas Gracias!miffed about is that NO ONE seems to use the more polite Usted form of Spanish any more.

I think one of the benefits of audio courses is that you can listen to them while walking or laying down.... you can't do that with this course though. You will have to sit at a desk, because this is one of those courses where you will have to look at the included coursebook to understand the audio component.<br /><br />There are no english translations on the CDs, so you can't listen to them alone. Although you also get a dictionary, in my opinion, both the dictionary and the course book aren't of very good quality.<br /><br />The first CD begins with about 10 minutes of useless spanish names & places around the world. Although this gives you an idea of the pronounciation, I believe that new words are at a premium for the beginner..... i.e. don't bombard us with utterly useless information!<br /><br />I highly recommend \\"Behind the Wheel Spanish\\" by \\"Language Dynamics\\" instead of this course. That program has a better coursebook, and better audio too. Although, I don't agree with driving while trying to learn a new language. Why? It requires too much concentration, meaning you can get too easily distracted, and you may have an accident.... (that applies with the \\"Learn in your car spanish\\" course too)	2005-04-25

I have been listening to about 30 minutes to 1 hour of spanish (various adio CDs) every day for the last 2 weeks, I think I've made a lot of progress with those and yet I **REALLY** struggled with this product. It says it is for beginners, intermediate & advanced... BZZZZT - WRONG!!<br /><br />REVIEW OF THE 5 CD-ROMs:<br />With the word association game, you basically have to GUESS what a word is [because when you hover the mouse over the word it won't reveal what it is], either that or look it up. HOWEVER you can't refer to the glossary while doing the exercise. So it becomes a futile game of trial and error. :-(<br /><br />What good is a program that doesn't teach you the words first???!!! It's extremely frustrating, to say the least.<br /><br />They would have been better off showing you the picture of the house, and saying: \\"that is a house\\" in spanish (\\"Eso es una casa\\", or whatever - and know I didn't learn that from using this software). So that eventually you at least know how to say that phrase. But instead they chuck you in the deep end, bombarding you with many new phrases. They could have put the pictures & videos to much better use by first telling you what they are & quizzing you on it later (we remember better with visual cues). I can't understand why this is the #1 selling software - it certainly explains why so many Americans can't speak spanish!! ;-)<br /><br />I agree with one of the other reviewers. Instant immersion is no good if you feel absolutely, totally & utterly LOST. Why do I think this? Because you feel like you are failing miserably. And that basically destroys ALL your confidence in being able to learn a new language. I believe you have to feel like you are making progress to succeed.<br /><br />Q:If you start off, fail the first exercise, fail everything else you attempt, don't even know when you are failing, discover that after 30 minutes or so you never even got close to a score of 100%, what happens to your motivation level?<br />A: It sinks down to about zero, and you hit the \\"door exit\\" icon pretty quickly.<br /><br />I am glad this is not my only spanish learning material; I would have quickly given up trying to learn spanish otherwise.<br />_________________________________<br /><br />REVIEW OF 3 AUDIO CDs:<br /><br />I think these CDs would be somewhat helpful for beginners, but only if they are trying to learn the language. It won't be of any help if you just want to learn a few phrases.<br /><br />The 1st CD covers the alphabet, sounds, and pronounciation. I found this helpful, but is is only 37 minutes long.<br /><br />The 2nd CD covers Greetings, and a description of verbs and pronouns, familiar & unfamiliar forms and where to use them. Ie: yo, nosotros, vosotros, el, ella, ellos, ellas, etc. If I didn't know this already, I would have found this helpful to begin with because rather than get stuck into saying words & phrases, their use is explained beforehand (I'm pretending that you won't be buying 10 different audio spanish kits). I think this is a good approach - it is different to the others. Other audio CDs fall into either one of two categories: \\"repeat after me\\" or \\"based on what you have just heard, try and say this new phrase now in spanish\\". I think a combination of this informative method and the \\"interactive\\" style would be the best bet. Length = 47 minutes.<br /><br />CD three covers verb conjugations, their use (i.e agreement in person number & tense). I haven't listened to all of this CD yet. This is a comparitavely meaty CD at 72 minutes long.<br /><br />WARNING: If you don't understand the english words: noun, verb, pronoun, adjective, infinitive, article, 1st person, 2nd person, 3rd person, etc... LOOK ELSEWHERE!!<br /><br />Bottom Line: I suggest you buy another all-audio version of Instant Immersion, but not the one with the computer software program & only then if you are seriously interested in learning to communicate in spanish.\\"door exit\\" icon pretty quickly.

The rate of learning is slow enought that you won't really need to press the pause button... contrary to what the back cover says, there is a lot of repetition of the same words involved - Pimsleur calls it \\"saturation\\". But they substitute words around where possible so you don't repeat the exact same phrase more than a few times in a row.<br /><br />The first CD is very simple indeed. The whole 60 minutes is taken up with just a handful of phrases (english equivalent):<br /><br />Do you speak? / do you understand? / I speak / a little / I speak a little spanish / you speak a little spanish / I don't speak / you don't speak english / no se&ntilde;orita / are you North American? / Yes se&ntilde;or / thankyou / how are you? / very good / good thanks / you speak spanish very well / good day...<br /><br />That's about all the content there is on the first CD, but there are several variations of the theme -word substitution- so it is a very slow rate of learning.<br /><br />In comparison, there is ~10 times as much content on virtually any of the other spanish audio CDs I have reviewed. According to the 3 CD set \\"Learn in your car spanish\\", that product conatins 600+ words. Whereas \\"Pimsleur quick & simple spanish\\" contains only 75 words.<br /><br />The good news is- I don't think I'll *ever* forget these phrases now, I believe they've been firmly etched in my brain. I.e. permanently! But I had already been exposed to these words previously, so I found it all rather boring.<br /><br />At this rate, I don't think I'll learn much more new information from the remaining CDs. Thus, I can only recommend this for people that know practically no spanish to begin with. Start here and follow up with other spanish audio products.<br /><br />**UPDATE** OK I am half way through now, and I realise I am enjoying this course more than the all the others I have trialled --- for the simple reason that it is INTERACTIVE. It's like having a language teacher right there. The speaker asks you to compose new sentances based on the phrases taught previously. I think it is a very effective method.<br /><br />Sure it is slow, but I think you can only learn & retain so many new words per day..... the good news is that Pimsleur makes sure they are CORE words. When I try to learn more words with other programs, I tend to forget them all too quickly. I am tempted to buy the full Pimsleur course, even though I already have 35+ hours of otehr spanish CDs to get through!!<br /><br />--- I'D GIVE IT FIVE STARS NOW ---<br /><br />____________________________________________<br /><br />INTERNATIONAL SHIPPING:<br />I was *extremely impressed* with Amazon's \\"Priority International Courier\\" shipping option. I ordered several spanish books + CDs and wanted them here so that I could start learning spanish ASAP, as my trip to Tenerife + South America is in a month's time.

Firstly, I have the CD version. The photo on the front looks exactly the same but it has a blue cover, not an orange one.<br /><br />There are better audio CD + phrase book kits out there. I bought 5 different kits, and this is by far the worst.<br /><br />What annoys me most about this is the corny melody they play at the beginning of each track. This soon becomes downright annoying. It's the same tune repeated OVER and OVER and OVER again. 15 times. I didn't even finish listening to it the 1st time, because I'd rather repeat one of my other spanish audio CDs. It's the kind of thing you'd buy just to annoy the neighbours.<br /><br />Regarding the phrase book, it's not the best either. First thing that comes to mind is the different sections are coloured differently... but it is so bright, it is distracting to read. It makes highlighter fluid look dull.<br /><br />The best phrase book is the Collins \\"Spanish Phrase Book & Dictionary\\" ISBN: 0004721403.<br /><br />As far as spanish audio CD + phrase books go, I recommend either the Dorling Kindersly (DK) \\"Spanish Eyewitness travel pack\\" (ISBN: 078949504X) and/or the \\"Spanish Phrase Book (Collins Gem S.)\\" [ISBN: 0007650957].

I am just beginning to learn spanish & I think you need to hear the spoken language before you can really begin to learn it. It's best if you can repeat the words to yourself.

There is a damn lot of spanish learning audio material out there which this set has to compete with...<br /><br />Now on to the info about this set...<br /><br />The 60 minute CD has virtually no intros or explanations, it seems to adhere strictly to repetition of english & spanish words & phrases.<br /><br />The english speaking host is a female, with a somewhat annoying American accent. The spanish voice is provided by a male. I can't say I enjoy listening to his accent either.<br /><br />In each case, the word or phrase is 1st said in english by the American woman, then it is repeated twice by the spanish guy.<br /><br />The recordings + words are clear enough, but the bottom line is the whole CD is pretty BORING. It lacks the enthusiasm of the Collins or DK audio CDs....<br /><br />This is not a good start to learning a new language. I've never really been a big fan of Lonely Planet stuff. What is all the fuss about, I wonder?<br /><br />At least the phrase book is okay... but I'm sure there a plenty of separate reviews for that.<br /><br />__________________________________________<br /><br />I can tell that not all CD + phrase book packs are created equal.... For a single CD + phrase book I'd recommend either the Collins Gem spanish phrase book + Audio CD kit or the Dorling Kindersley (DK) Eyewitness Travel guide phrase book + audio CD travel pack. They are both cheaper too!<br /><br />V  HOPE THIS WAS HELPFUL TO YOU!+ phrase book packs are created equal....

US	38630671	R22IKJTZEI4E67	0007650957	762862081	Spanish Phrase Book CD Pack (Collins Gem) (Spanish and English Edition)	Books	5	6	6	N	N	EXCELLENT.	First I should say I went overboard and bought 5 (yes FIVE!) different spanish audio CD kits... I did this because:<br />1) They are cheap enough to,<br />2) I thought if I got bored of one I could listen to a different CD from another kit, rather than listening to the same CD 5 times over, and<br />3) Hardly any reviews have been written and you just don't know what you're buying (meaning: I couldn't decide, so I bought them all!).<br /><br />I can tell you they are not created equal. For a single CD + phrase book I'd rate the collins Gem kit in the top two. The other good one being the Dorling Kindersley (DK) Eyewitness Travel guide phrase book + audio CD. If you can afford it, and you're looking for an easy intro, I'd buy both this one and the DK audio CD + phrasebook kit. They complement eachother well because one (collins) has a female spanish voice and the other (DK) a male.<br />____________________________________<br /><br />What I like about this little pack is that includes an audio CD, which doesn't appear obvious at first... I am just beginning to learn spanish & I think you need to hear the spoken language before you can really begin to learn it. It's best if you can repeat the words to yourself. Now on to the info about this set...<br /><br />The 40 minute CD has a bit of an intro, which is good, rather than just jumping straight into it like some of the other spanish audio CDs. I find this pschs you up for it more so! It's nice to hear something like: \\"now a section on asking for things\\" followed by a brief explanation about something... at the beginning of a track, etc.<br /><br />The english speaking host is a male, with a british accent, which I find easy to listen to. The spanish voice is provided by a female. I'm not sure what dialect, but it's a damn sexy voice!! In each case, the word or phrase is 1st said in english by the UK bloke, then it is repeated twice in that sexy spanish voice (said slowly both times). However, there is not really enough time to repeat the words aloud, unless you say them quickly enough....<br /><br />The native spanish speaker does a very good job of saying the words slowly. It's hard to say something or ask a question slowly and not sound monotone. But she manages to speak slowly with the right amount of enthusiam and inflection. Top marks for that.<br /><br />The CD is good because they cover appropriate, essential & simple words first. This may seem obvious but some of the other kits don't do this - they start with the most odd words and phrases (or worse, they rattle on for 5 minutes a load of spanish words with no english translations). However, this CD is only 40 minutes, while the DK one is 70 minutes long.<br /><br />Another plus: The only musical melodies on *this* CD are at the beginning and the end!<br />(The *berlitz CD* was the worst offender in that department, having the most corny tune -THE SAME ONE- between every track)<br /><br />Yet another plus: None of those annoying american accents, which the rest of us can't stand to listen to. ;-)<br /><br />The phrasebook is very small, but has a 5000 thousand word dictionary (both english-spanish and spanish-english, which I think is important). The phrase book is superior to the \\"Dorling Kindersley (DK) Eyewitness Travel guide phrase book\\", because that one only has english to spanish dictionary. This one also has 2 colours: black for english, blue for spanish. This feature makes it is easier to read and find words in the dictionary. But I still don't feel like reading through a phrase books with only two colours! At least, not after seeing the collins one I bought separately... see below...<br /><br />I also have the larger spanish phrase book which has glossy pages (this one has matt pages- but at this price none of kits with audio have glossy pages). Although it's not much different to the phrase book included here, it is easier to peruse through because it has various important bits outlined in colour boxes, and more, so I'd recommend that as well.<br /><br />V Hope this was helpful to you, and I wish you good luck with learning spanish!ith learning spanish!	2005-04-04

It's best if you can repeat the words to yourself. Now on to the info about this set...<br /><br />The 70 minute CD has a bit of an intro, which is good, rather than just jumping straight into it like some of the other spanish audio CDs. I find this pschs you up for it more so! It's nice to hear: \\"Welcome to the Dorling Kindersley spanish travel pack...\\" and something like \\"here are some numbers starting on page 19...\\" at the beginning of most tracks, etc. This is followed by any important notes.<br /><br />The english speaking host is a female, with a british accent, which I find easy to listen to. The spanish voice is provided by a male, and it is pleasing to hear as well. In the beginning, the word or phrase is 1st said in english, followed slowly in spanish, and finally spanish @ normal pace. This is followed by a brief pause to allow you to repeat the word. At about the halfway mark, they ditch the slow spanish. Even so, there is quite a lot of material to be covered here, and it is presented at just the right pace (if it seems like a case of brain overload the 1st time, listen to that section again). It was never fast enough to get fed up with it, and not to slow to start skipping tracks (but then finding yourself getting overwhelmed). I thought I would be able to listen to it in one sitting, but there is too much to learn. I found it took me about 3 hours to listen to it over 2 or 3 days.<br /><br />The CD is good because, like the collins kit, they cover appropriate, essential & simple words first. This may seem obvious but some of the other kits don't do this - they start with the most odd words and phrases (or worse, they rattle on for 5 minutes a load of spanish words with no english translations). It is 30 minutes longer than the collins one which is a definite plus.<br /><br />Another plus: It does not include any unnecessary stupid-sounding melodies!<br />(The berlitz CD was the worst offender in that department)<br /><br />Yet another plus: None of those annoying american accents, which the rest of us can't stand to listen to. ;-)<br /><br />Still yet another plus: The words on this CD are clearly spoken, and the recording is clear during the pauses... (in contrast the \\"Learn in Your Car Spanish\\" 3 CD set sounded like it was copied from tapes, or from a computer with a dodgey audio card).<br /><br />Sadly, there is a dark cloud in this sunny sky: The DK phrasebook is just merely satisfactory; it lacks a spanish-english section. So if you want to look up a word in spanish, you can't. The phrase book included in this kit is also monochrome (meaning BLACK text only), whereas the collins gem one has two colours: black for english, blue for spanish. Needless to say, I prefer the collins gem phrase book.... Preferably the separate one listed below...<br /><br />I also have the larger collins spanish phrase book with the orange cover (see my review) That phrase book has glossy pages (this one has matt pages- but at this price none of kits with audio have glossy pages). It is easier to peruse through because it has various important bits outlined in colour boxes, and more, so I'd recommend that as well.<br /><br />V Hope this was helpful to you, and I wish you good luck with learning spanish!rious important bits outlined in colour boxes, and more, so I'd recommend that as well.

It is written/edited by someone with a PhD, in a reporting style which may annoy some people. It is well-referenced, though I think most people will not care less for seeking out the various journal articles. For example, it often starts a paragraph in this manner: \\"one study shows that...\\"<br />A quote: \\"Our baseline modeling condition has used a coefficient of rolling resistance (Crr) value of 0.0032, which is representative of an average racing clincher tire (Martin et al. 1998). Kyle (1986) has reported the Crr for high-performance road-racing tubular and clincher tires to be 16 percent lower (0.0027) when measured on an asphalt surface. Some road-racing tubular tires, however, exhibit Crr values as high as 0.0059 (Kyle 1986).<br />Now what is the point of that? The findings (on whether tubulars or clinchers offer lower rolling resistance) seem to be inconclusive. It doesn't tell us which brand + model tubulars had the higher rolling resistance, so you'd have to look up the article by Kyle if you really wanted to know which tubulars to avoid. At the very least it can be gleaned that the chapter concerning equipment isn't much help.<br />This book creates a very small niche for itself, perhaps too small. It seems to be aimed at coaches or deadly serious cyclists. I can't imagine there are too many of those in the world. But if that is the case, why bother defining the terms \\"prologue\\", \\"criterium\\" and \\"stage race\\"?<br />I'll be honest -I haven't read the entire book- but I still didn't find the three chapters on body and machine very useful, nor the chapters covering performance assessment. The nutrition & recovery sections were of assistance, as was the chapter on training in extreme conditions (for me at least).<br />However, I was disappointed that two very important \\"tips\\" were not mentioned regarding training in extremely hot climates, namely: avoid black or dark clothes, as they absorb a LOT of heat; and consume icey cold fluids as they are absorbed into the body faster than tepid fluids. Furthermore, although hypothermia was discussed, there was no mention of the dangerous condition that may arise if extremely frigid air is rapidly inhaled by athletes - the trachea (i.e. your windpipe or whatever) freezes. Absolutely no mention of these important facts, in a book that purports to discuss training in extreme climates!! (...)>I just can't imagine that a large proportion of the considerable number of  amazon customers (229,000) of this book own their own hypobaric chambers (or else would have the time and money to train and live at separate altitudes), so I can't fathom how the chapter on altitude training is going to be beneficial to the majority of readers.<br />On the up side, the book contains many helpful graphs and tables throughout, and the end of each chapter also contains brief summaries.<br />I didn't buy this book to be able to improve at competition, I bought it to become a better cyclist. My advice, for what its worth: if you're not a scientist with a PhD like I've almost got, and you don't intend on reading a thesis to get some pointers, don't buy this book!

It's been a while since I last flicked through this book, which tells you something about it. It's a good book, no doubt about it, but I bought it at the same time as another book &quot;The Complete Book of Long-Distance Cycling&quot; (see my review on that one too!). That book overshadows this one, as it goes into more detail and THAT is the one I find myself re-reading. First and foremost as one of the authors is the same, a lot of the stuff is doubled up.<br />Note that this book is only 110 pages long and the pages are fairly small. Once again, every page or so, bits of the book are worthy of being highlighted.<br />If you read bicycling magazine often (which I don't) you probably already know a lot of the content. If you've been cycling for several years (10 for me), I think a lot of the tips can be described as common sense, such as keeping your cadence around 90rpm, consuming carbohydrates and staying hydrated...<br />But I get the feeling that it tries to cover too much ground. This is more of a book that uses point form. It does get to the crux of the matter quickly, but I prefer to understand /why/ a method works, not just be told that it works, so go do it. Be aware that not all of the techniques discussed here will suit your style of riding. I mean I'm never going to practise sprints. I'm wondering now if I did all they suggested on a ride, I wouldn't enjoy it anymore. Practise you're breathing, cycle for two minutes with alternate legs, concentrate on achieving a flat back posture, pull back then up on the pedals... too much to think about at any one time.<br />Don't expect to find many weekly training plans in here. For me that was good news, as I've never followed one. I think it all depends on how you're feeling (not to mention the weather and other things that crop up).<br />One annoying thing, the rest of the world uses metric units: some people, like me, have absolutely no idea how much a fluid ounce is. For the rest of the planet, 1oz = 28ml of water.<br />Bottom line: I'd say get this book if you've fairly new to cycling and keen to learn ways of improving - take what you want from it and don't worry about the rest.water. <br />Bottom line: I'd say get this book if you've fairly new to cycling and keen to learn ways of improving - take what you want from it and don't worry about the rest.	2004-06-03

This is a terrific book on the subject of Materials Science.<br />This is the sort of book more engineers should read, as they lack knowledge in this department. It covers metals, ceramics, plastics and composites as well as briefly covering other materials such as semiconductors. It talks about fabrication processes, microstructures as well as the properties of typical materials - for example with metal alloys, casting, forging etc are discussed as well as phase diagrams.<br />The last section discusses the application of various materials for use in several different parts. In the edition I have, they are automobile valve springs, an artificial femoral component, and space shuttle tiles, as well as the strength-weight optimisation of various beams. It goes into each aspect of the design, for example how many stress cycles the valve will undergo in the typical lifetime, and give a specific failure rate. Quite interesting.<br />There are also sections on thermal properties, electrical properties, atomic lattices, and more... I can't remember, it's been a while since I last looked through it properly. In summary, this book is packed with sufficient information to give you general knowledge of each field covered and get you interested, without going overboard -something that most university textbooks tend to do.	2004-06-03

How do I know this book is not as good as it should be?<br />Well, I have a very similar DK &quot;ultimate&quot; book for bicycles. That one covers everything from all the different bikes &amp; accesories to the skills &amp; techniques required for good riding, as well as general maintenance.<br />THIS motorcycle book has none of that. 90% of the book covers various motorcycles, most of them old cruisers, with just a few points on each one. It has only about 18 brief pages at the end to discuss the workings of a motorcycle and other things such as tyres, clothes, etc. That is just not enough.<br />This book is simply a summary of various motorycles from a historical perspective (with hardly any included from the &quot;sports-bike&quot; category). Not only that - all the bikes are old ones starting from 100 years ago. None of the newer sports bikes are covered in any sort of real detail. But aren't they one of the most popular [if not THE most popular] types of bikes? (I don't know, because I'm new to this) Any book worthy of using the word &quot;ultimate&quot; is the title must be both well-balanced and very thorough. This book is neither.<br />If you want my opinion, do not buy this book if you have not seen it. I can't believe everyone else rated it so highly, unless of course they're the sort who get nostalgic reading all about a bunch of old cruisers!	2003-01-09

Iler is a scientific genius!!	Ok, I just had to write this review to even out the other one. This literally a whole life's work on silica. It deserves 5 stars, if not more!!<br />Like the Title says, It covers everything: true silica solutions (e.g. monosilicic acid); polymerisation of silica networks; colloidal aggregation (gel formation); surface chemistry (Si-OH bonding), etc. The most relevant section to me was the colloidal aggregation and silanol groups, since my PhD is on opal. But it definitely won't take the place of the appropriate scientific journal articles to your specific field of study. Consider it a damn good intro to silicate chemistry. The whole book is easily understood, because there aren't too many formulae (which tend to cause discontinuities in texts). Just the information that you need on silica.<br />It has loads of figures (for example: effect of pH or temperature on gel formation), and you will often see them reprinted in various science papers - even today (they're that good). It isn't one of those symposium-type books; this is the only book of its kind.<br />The only thing is the price. If you want your very own copy, you'll have to cough up [a lot of money]. Let's face it, if you're researching silica: you're going to need this book. Either you'll have to allocate some of your research fund, or you might consider borrowing it from your local library.	2002-07-02

Fortunately, it is not the least bit religious, despite the suggestive title. There are some truly wonderful examples that usually involve the reader directly, and I relished reading it. No pictures, but none are needed as the words themselves convey the ideas successfully. I found the sections on gastrulation, ancestry, bees, eyes, particularly fascinating. The two chapters \\"Do Good by Stealth\\" and \\"The Replication Bomb\\" were exceptional!<br />For me, it was refreshing, because I was accustomed to reading astronomy books. The book was just the right length. I was very satisfied when I finished it and I did not desire to keep reading about the same topic. The size of the font is perfect, unlike a few of Richard Dawkin's other books, in which it is way too small.<br />It is the sort of book that if you haven't read it in a while and you then open it at random and start reading [as I'm doing now to effectively review the book] it draws you right in again and before you know it, you're reading several pages again!<br />After reading it, the only trouble I found was that although I understood the /function/ of a gene, I wasn't exactly sure what it actually /is/. Is it a DNA sequence?<br />But if you think genes and DNA do everything, then you might want to read the book \\"How the Leopard changed its spots\\", because it reveals that chemistry, mathematics and physics play a significant role in the formation of an organism.	2002-06-24

If you really like the image on the cover, then *please* do yourself a favour and go and search the internet for the phrase &quot;Mandelbrot set&quot;, and you'll come up with loads of pictures equally as fascinating (and you won't have to read all those pages!).<br />This book only touches on what Chaos actually is. I found myself wanting more - NOT because it was a good book, but because I knew it was poorly written book on a good subject.<br />I'm going to explain a few things first in this paragraph so you can understand the way the book is written. If my perception of the book is correct, the concept of Chaos itself, is that at first, an event appears as if it is purely random. But upon closer inspection, the underlying process is ordered, which makes the result only /seem/ random. Chaos is *not* the same thing as randomness; it is a special type of randomness. Change the parameters only slightly, and the order is revealed. &quot;Order in chaos&quot; is the appropriate phrase that is repeated throughout the book. The other phrase that comes to mind is &quot;sensitive dependence on initial conditions&quot;, which simply means that the outcome of an event is extremely susceptible to the initial circumstances. You could say that our lives are like that. Another easy example of a chaotic system is the weather - it changes all the time, with no apparent direction. Who knows exactly where an individual cloud will be in the sky ten years from now? However, it is all caused by the interactions of the inherently simple processes like evaporation from the sea, gravitational forces from the moon, etc. It looks random, when in reality, it is only /extremely/ complex.<br />The book takes forever to convey these fundamental ideas, which I've essentially explained to you in one or two paragraphs. There are a few nice examples, but overall, I think an unusual topic such as this needs many more real-life examples of chaos at work. This is one of those types of books that introduce all the many people who made this field of study possible. In my humble opinion, James Gleick would have been much better of writing about where chaos is seen in nature.<br />Perhaps all randomness is in a sense chaotic. I don't know. I guess it depends on whether or not you think the entire Universe can be described in terms of physical laws. Some people will say that it can, others will say that it can't. I'd probably say that by its very complexity, there isn't (and won't be) a computer, or a mind, or anything, powerful enough to effectively model everything and ultimately tell you what is truly random behaviour and therefore not chaotic.<br />This book did get me to think for myself a little, which is good, but now I think I'll go and find another book on chaos or complexity theory, and it won't be authored by James Gleick.oduce all the many people who made this field of study possible.

This is a terrific book, which covers a whole range of astronomical phenomena. Black holes, the big bang, the big crunch, the multiverse, dark matter, etc. Interestingly, dark matter isn't as spooky as it sounds - it only refers to things in the universe we can't see because they aren't bright enough - objects such as planets.<br />Although I accept the astronomical evidence for the expansion of the &lt;known&gt; universe, this man will tell you that the whole universe was originally the size of a single pea. I'd like to know how these people can have the audacity to extrapolate to the extreme like this. If my professor saw me doing that with one of my graphs, he'd scream! How can they know PRECISELY what happens in the first yoctosecond after the big bang?! They can only do that if they know everything. Real scientists will admit that they don't know everything. A true scientist will tell you that once you're in extrapolation territory, you're also in uncertain territory. What will most likely happen is that people will discover that the current model of condensed matter physics was merely an approximation, and suddenly the whole notion of a universe the size of a pea will be outdated.<br />For all those out there that think everything can and will be determined, you might like to know that there is such a thing as the &quot;n-body problem&quot;. It states that for more than 3 bodies (be it planets or stars), with an initial position and velocity, it becomes extremely difficult to know their subsequent motion, because of the gravitational influence that each of the bodies exerts on all of the other bodies. Basically, it takes the greatest supercomputers on Earth just to predict the eventual motion of the nine planets in our own solar system. And you know there are approximately 10,000 billion billion stars in this universe.<br />Martin Rees talks of a multiverse, which is kind of like a load of bubbles, and we exist inside one of them and the edge of our known &quot;universe&quot; is the wall of the bubble. That would mean that we aren't even aware of the other bubbles. If something like a big crunch happens to our bubble, then there are still all those other bubbles that will continue to exist. I think this idea is sensible, because humans have always underestimated the size of &quot;their&quot; universe.<br />Overall a great introduction to cosmology.ot;universe&quot; is the wall of the bubble.

This isn't as stupid as it sounds. The infrared spectrum of comets &amp; galaxies are surprisingly similar to that obtained from viruses/bacteria found on Earth. Most bacteria on Earth are remarkably resistant to extremes in temperature found in outer space; they will continue to thrive after being exposed to temperatures of only a few degrees above absolute zero. Yet the Earth NEVER gets that cold, and according to the theory of evolution they shouldn't evolve to be this impervious to extremely cold conditions. He attributes the periodic influenza epidemics to the passing of the Earth through the tails of nearby comets in orbit. This is quite a claim!<br />But Hoyle provides all the convincing scientific evidence necessary to prove his point - there are just the right amount of relevant figures, which reveal all the data that brings him to this conclusion. The style of writing is unpretentious and not overcomplicated, and it flows very well. The proposition is very original, and I doubt you'll find another book like this. Revolutionary.	2002-06-21

If you love nature, you will love this book.<br />The chapter &quot;In the company of ants&quot; is probably one of the best chapters [of any book] that I have ever read. I found the hierarchal structure of the leaf-cutter ants very intriguing. What marvellous little creatures! I'll never look at an ant the same way again. Here's a little snippet for you:<br />&quot;Watch where you step. Be careful of little lives. Feed them crumbs of coffeecake. They also like bits of tuna and whipped cream. Get a magnifying glass. Watch them closely. And you will be as close as any person may ever come to seeing social life as it might evolve on another planet.&quot;<br />I also loved three other chapters entitled, &quot;Humanity seen from a distance&quot;, &quot;The little things that run the world&quot; and the final chapter, &quot;Is humanity suicidal?&quot;. Other interesting chapters are about snakes, or rather serpents, sharks, altruism &amp; aggression, etc. The essence of the book is really as the title suggests, &quot;in search of nature&quot;.<br />Towards the end, a sincere and legitimate message is delivered by the author. It is a very moving assertion and everyone, yes everyone, should read it. Edwin O. Wilson is proof that Carl Sagan wasn't the only good author.	2002-06-21

This book contains numerous examples of design, from an engineering perspective. The theme is on comparing the design of evolution with that of technological invention. Although the book is almost precisely 50% natural and 50% artificial, you get the impression that the author is slightly biased in favour of technology. He acknowledges they are different: nature abhors using straight lines, engineers love them; nature has not been able to employ metals, yet they are commonly used in our constructions.<br />I for one would never be critical (as this guy sometimes is) of nature by saying that it never utilises metals or whatever. It doesn't need to - it isn't required. To favour an I-beam over a tree limb is foolish and misguided. Is a piece of metal or lump of concrete alive? Certainly not. The astonishing feature of nature is that it manages to evolve these things, that are inherently living entities, which can grow and replicate themselves with no awareness or foresight!<br />So the trouble with this book is that it doesn't address the fact that a tree does way more than just support itself: a tree is not just a vertical structure; it is an extremely complex photosynthesis machine. It is self-powered AND self-generating. It would take a tremendous amount of technology to create a very minuscule and seemingly simple creature such as an amoeba, let alone an extremely complex multicellular organism such as a hummingbird - currently, it is totally impossible. Yet nature does it for free and that is some accomplishment.<br />There are many obvious observations in the book, and in places it can be a little dull. I really don't think there are many people who will thoroughly enjoy this book. Either you'll be the type of person who prefers natural evolution, or you'll prefer technological invention, and so either way half of the book will not be very appealing.<br />A similar book is called &quot;Diatoms to Dinosaurs&quot;. I think that book is a much more interesting read - it is predominantly concerned with nature, not with technology, and some of the examples are just so much more alluring/enticing/intriguing.- it is predominantly concerned with nature, not with technology, and some of the examples are just so much more alluring/enticing/intriguing.	2002-06-21

The book is about muscles and skeletons, hearts, fluids and brains. Quite a large chunk of the book is about flight. I found the most captivating chapter was &quot;Tiffany wings and kite strings&quot;. It is all about tiny fliers: microfilm model airplanes and microscopic flying insects. It reveals that the mechanism that insects use to fly is different to birds. After reading this, you may think twice about squishing the next harmless little insect that flies right by you. The section on drag was surprisingly very interesting.<br />Although it introduces familiar animals, it goes into enough detail to provide substantially new and rewarding information about these creatures, which you almost certainly won't be aware of. There are loads of great diagrams, which really make this book very enjoyable to read. The book is straightforward and I relished reading it.<br />A very very similar book is called &quot;Cats' Paws and Catapults&quot;. It also contains many examples of design, although it is from an engineering perspective, and the focus is on comparing the design of evolution with that of technological invention.

It is really only about how George Smoot's team of scientists got the funding together and made the actual Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE) satellite. Too many names of people. This is just an autobiography of the people that made the project happen. If you like the sounds of that, go right ahead and buy it, you'll lap it up - but make no mistake, this is not popular science.<br />By looking at the microwave spectrum of the sky, COBE revealed that the galaxies present today were merely inhomogeneities in the distribution of matter 300,000 years after the big bang. He takes 300 pages to convey what I've said in one sentence. The book should have been made half as long, then it would have been twice as interesting.<br />At every stage throughout reading the book, I wondered when Smoot was just going to get on with it, but no the whole damn book is an autobiography written in first person.

The main theme is about how DNA doesn't need to provide information in every detail to produce an organism. Chemical, physical and mathematical forces also play a significant part in the production of an organism. The book is also about how natural selection is not the only process at work for evolutionary advancement. I totally agree with the conclusion, and he's sure changed my thoughts on the subject, but it was a challenge to read it all because of the way it is written. It could have been more fun.<br />For the others that read this book and still don't get &quot;how the leopard changed its spots&quot; - its a metaphor. Leopards aren't supposed to change their spots. The leopard symbolises scientists like Richard Dawkins and others who are fixated with genetic evolution and DNA. After reading this book, will they change their ways? Its not about leopards!<br />It does have loads of fascinating examples, with all the relevant diagrams &amp; figures to make the point clear, so he's done a good job assembling all of those. From ant colonies &amp; the BZ reaction, to evolution of the eye &amp; fibrillation in the human heart. An example: it is the concentration of calcium that causes the single celled organism (Acetabularia) to grow to a particular shape, NOT the DNA. He also explains why a sunflower seed head forms a spiral, and it is all to do with mathematics, nothing to do with sunflower DNA.<br />The trouble with this book is that the author uses the word &quot;dynamic&quot; waaaay too much. It quickly becomes very annoying. He is obsessed with that word. Open the book at random, and you will see what I am talking about. Aside from that, it is very tedious to read. Instead of making the ideas easily understood, it seems Brian Goodwin goes out of his way to make it complicated.<br />I'd really like to give it 3.5 stars, because at the end of it I was glad I read it, but I wouldn't necessarily recommend it to anyone, because there are better books out there (you might like to see my other reviews on popular science books).

First, let me say that I am a scientist, and in my eyes this book just doesn't cut it. \\"The last three minutes\\" is all about how this author thinks the Universe will end. Worst of all - in more than one place it speculates about how some almighty supreme being might be able to think forever, based on the laws of thermodynamics.<br />He talks about colonisation by the human species to other planets. Excuse me, colonisation? The rate we are going we won't last a few decades into the future. It would be totally irrational to even contemplate that, with all of our earthbound problems. A few astronauts going to the planet Mars and beyond and starting up their own damn colony does all of the rest of us here a fat lot of good now, doesn't it?!<br />Suggestions like these invite a \\"disposable planet\\" mentality. Bugger up the world and move on. It would be far easier to fix up the ozone hole here on Earth than terraform the planet Mars.<br />He proposes that we might genetically engineer ourselves to better adapt to other worlds. Why don't we genetically engineer ourselves to be more benevolent first? I think Paul Davies has a damn nerve to speak on behalf of all of humanity like this.<br />Paul Davies says is that if there isn't enough matter in the Universe to halt the expansion, it will expand forever. Fair enough. Except then he goes on to mention a sci-fi novel, \\"...which tells the story of a community of conscious beings who live on the surface of a neutron star. These beings utilize nuclear rather than chemical reactions to sustain their existence.\\" Then Paul Davies states that, \\"Unfortunately, adopting this strategy as a means of survival has a downside: the greater will be the rate of energy dissipation and the more rapidly will the available energy resources become depleted. You might think that this would inevitably spell doom for our descendants, whatever physical form they might adopt. But not necessarily so.\\" He then continues with the discussion.<br />This idea is ludicrous - absolute absurdity, that's what it is! Anyone who knows exactly how dense and hot a neutron star is will know we won't EVER be colonising one. These completely ridiculous concepts are totally inappropriate in a popular science book!<br />I'll quote another bit of it for you:<br />\\"...eventually all black holes will simply disappear in a puff of radiation... a black hole of one solar mass would take 10^66 years to disappear, while a supermassive hole would take more like 10^93 years... and the process wouldn't even get underway until the background temperature of the universe had dropped below that of the black hole... and it would take 10^22 years before this cooled to the level... the process... isn't something you sit around and watch.\\"<br />Well that is THE UNDERSTATEMENT of the decade!! Then he goes on to say that after 10^1500 years (a 1 followed by 1500 zeroes) all matter will transmute into the most stable nuclear form, which is iron. OK, so you are all very much aware of the difference between one dollar, one thousand dollars and one million dollars - those numbers vary by there zeroes. Now try to imagine a number 1 followed by one thousand five hundred zeroes, and how many years that would be. Seriously now, this is just such an inconceivably long time, I doubt it has any real meaning for us beings that rarely make it to a hundred.<br />One aspect of the \\"big crunch\\" is not discussed by Paul Davies. If all the matter in the known universe is hurtling towards a central point, rather than form a big crunch and the end of the universe, why doesn't a giant black hole form instead which is far more physically feasible?<br />I also think that the notion that the whole universe will \\"end\\" is preposterous. How can Paul Davies have the audacity to state that, on the single assumption that the universe seems to get simpler as astronomers look out with their telescopes, and therefore the \\"local\\" universe is ALL that exists? What is beyond the observable horizon? I'll tell you *nobody* on Earth knows. We can never be certain; it is impossible.<br />Does Paul Davies honestly think that all these outrageous speculations will impress people? It does the opposite with me. I begin to wonder if has is losing all his rationality. My worry is that his books appeal to non-scientists and they'll just believe whatever he writes. He contributes to the stereotypical image of scientists so obsessed with obscure & totally impractical concepts that they are not at all concerned with the here and now of everyday life. If you ask me, he's more like one of those theologians than a scientist. Sure, he may have a doctorate, but even I'LL have one of those in a few months time.<br />This guy honestly turned me off Astronomy, I now read books about biology, because I think it is just so much more fascinating to read about amazing things on the surface of this planet, here and now. THIS IS WITHOUT A DOUBT THE WORST BOOK I HAVE EVER READ. I only regret that I didn't write this 1 star review ages ago, because I just might have prevented a few more people from having to endure reading this baloney from cover to cover.<br />I give it 1 dying star...horizon?

It covers the different types of bicycles and parts; so frames, gearing, brakes and accessories are all covered in detail. There is a materials &amp; construction section, although since I am a Material Scientist, I find that the alternative materials sections is still very conservative. The bit about construction methods of frames, however, is adequate.<br />Much of the information is out-dated, especially the bits about the various brakes. Nobody wants to know about stirrup-brakes, pivot-link brakes, u-brakes and roller-lever brakes anymore - because you simply won't find them on modern bikes - and even cantilever brakes are now obsolete. Hub brakes are really only found on BMX bikes, and let's face it, kids who ride those won't want to read this. One simple diagram would have been enough.<br />The author of this book should team up with the author of &quot;The Bicycle Wheel&quot;; you can tell from their style of writing that they're both from the &quot;old-school&quot; of engineering design and therefore extremely sceptical of the benefits of new technology. It is as if someone told them when they were teenagers that steel is the only legitimate material for building bicycle components. For a book that is entitled &quot;Bicycle Technology&quot;, it is very misleading.<br />It has lots of hand drawn illustrations, one might say too many, because there are about two on every page. There are also many irrelevant B&amp;W photos, which are of certain brands of parts that the author invariably favours. But there is NOT ONE single color photograph in the whole book - aside from one on the front cover!<br />What I DID find informative were the little sections on tire sizing, gear progression, tubing types and steering geometry. The chapter on the drive train is also okay.<br />This book will only really provide a general overview that will cover the existing gaps in your knowledge. A beginner won't be interested, because it is too boring, overwhelming &amp; tedious to read, and someone who would otherwise be interested will already know most things.

With all of these books, the authors only include crashes that were caused by true accidents or \\"mistakes\\" made by people in the air industry; they do not include disasters based on terrorism or deliberate sabotage attempts.<br />In my opinion, the most tragic accidents are the ones outlined in chapters 3, 8, 9, 12, 15, 17 and 18. In chapter 8, you witness how a DC9 ran out of fuel and was forced to ditch into the sea - despite having the required fuel to the destination, enough fuel to get to the alternate airport, as well as 30 minutes holding fuel, plus an extra 10%. Extraordinary!<br />Chapter 12 tells of a flight crew that were so preoccupied with one of the three landing lights not lighting up (for the undercarriage) that none of them noticed that they had bumped the control-column and inadvertantly disengaged the autopilot. The plane crashed, killing over half on board, although afterwards it was discovered that the fimalment of the offending light bulb had simply burnt out and the landing gear was indeed in the down and locked position.<br />One of the most Catastrophic disasters, was when everyone aboard the Turkish Airline 767 lost their life because a cargo door fell off. In a rare description of the aftermath, another pilot reported on the scene, \\"There were fragments of bodies and pieces of flesh everywhere that were hardly recognisable. Not far from where I stood were two hands clasping each other, a man's hand tightly holding a woman's hand, two hands that withstood disintegration...\\"<br />Finally, the last chapter tells the horrific yet mesmerising story behind the events of the worlds biggest Air Disaster at Tenerife in 1977 involving two 747's (PanAm. and KLM). Ironically, this occurred while both aircraft were still on the ground. I won't go into the details, because it is just waaay to complex (ultimately it was caused by perhaps ten or so \\"incidents\\" - and if the outcome had have been different for any one of them, the whole thing would have been averted). Let's just say that the series of events that lead to the tragedy is just astonishing. In reality, it is always a string of highly improbable events that leads to a catastrophe of this magnitude. Ultimately, the death toll rose to 583 - to this day it remains the worst accidental disaster involving one or more aircraft.<br />Unlikely as it may seem, this book has made me realise how safe air travel is - what I mean is that now I can at least understand how the accidents happened, and therefore how unlikely they are to occur.utcome had have been different for any one of them, the whole thing would have been averted).

Sometimes, it is uncanny when the pilots say something in the cockpit that is later retrieved by the voice-recorder, it is as if they knew something was going to happen. Like the United Airlines pilot that commented: &quot;Nice looking day - hard to believe the skies are unfriendly.&quot;<br />The most interesting one I found was where the Thai Airways A310 crashed into the Himalayas in Nepal. How could a plane crash into a mountain? Communication errors, mainly. But you'll have to read it to find out.<br />Another unusual one, was when the pilot's children came to the cockpit of a Russian Aeroflot plane and the son then &quot;flew&quot; the aircraft under his father's supervision, leading to the rather drastic consequences of everyone aboard perishing. It was not as you might think, the son's fault, rather, the autopilot disconnected without them becoming aware of it and the fact that the captains control-yoke overrides the second officer's.<br />After reading the first three books, my respect for pilots has increased tenfold. Most of them do what they think is the correct action (at the time) for averting a disaster. It is all too easy to say with the benefit of hindsight that they should have done this or they should have done that. It has also made me aware, that it is often pilot error that causes incidents. Rarely does a &quot;wing fall off&quot; like I used to think happened. Oh, and bring back the Flight Engineer - had they been present on flight decks during some of the more recent incidents of this book, they probably could have prevented or averted those disasters.<br />I would like to see the authors make a 5th instalment, focusing on more recent disasters, and ones in which the circumstances are caused by something other than turbulence or the autopilot being in the wrong mode. Such as the collision caused in Lima, Peru on October 2nd, 1997 -where a pilot radioed that his cockpit instrumentation was malfunctioning. Turned out workers forgot to remove the duct tape that they had placed over key sensors while cleaning the plane. In this edition, too many of the crashes are similar, and it is like reading the same story twice.e duct tape that they had placed over key sensors while cleaning the plane.

If you really liked the first Air Disaster book, then get this one, because it is fascinating stuff.<br />In my opinion, the most tragic accidents are the ones outlined in chapters 2 to 7 and 9 & 10. For me, the most interesting read was concerning an American Airlines DC10; just after takeoff at Chicago O'Hare airport - the left engine ripped off by itself and separated from the wing, tumbling out of control down the runway. As you can imagine, the subsequent scene as the aircraft careened out of control were horrific.<br />It was eventually found that this incident was caused by Continental's air maintenance crews, who removed the engines and mounts as one piece instead of the way that McDonnell Douglas had specified them to be removed separately, and consequently the engine mounts were damaged. So there you go: human error after all!<br />Yet another unique crash involved a collision between a 727 and a Cessna. How could two planes collide you wonder? Only one way to find out...<br />And also included is the infamous Air New Zealand DC-10 that crashed into Mt Erebus during a scenic flight over Antarctica.<br />This edition includes two photos (one is especially spine-chilling) of planes that are within [split]seconds of crashing. One can only imagine how the crew and passengers felt at that time.<br />This book also made me aware of one very ubiquitous misconception: people think that if you're flying on a 747 at 37,000 feet and all four engines fail, you'll hit the ground like a dart. This simply isn't true. A 747 with no engines takes roughly 23 minutes with a 3-degree glide slope to reach the ground from this altitude! Moreover, it can resume level flight on only one engine! Incredible.<br />If there's something else that this series has taught me, it's that an accident is most likely to occur immediately after takeoff, or sometime within half an hour of takeoff.	2002-06-02

The three things I can notice from about 100 feet away are: their seat is too low; their chain is insufficiently lubricated; and the derailleurs are not adjusted properly. This book will teach you how to set up your bike correctly, and provide you with essential knowledge on cycling.<br />This has all the info in it for beginners and intermediates alike. The main sections are: mountain bikes, racing bikes and touring bikes, future bikes and cycle maintenance. Within these pages, you'll find info about bike set-up/positioning, sizing of frames, clothing, riding techniques, racing and stretching. Plus more info on other specific bike parts, such as: frame construction, types of wheels, gears/brakes, etc. Also specific info about various types of bikes used in: observed trials, the tour de France, criterium races, time¨Ctrials, triathlons, track racing (& classic bikes).<br />The maintenance section is quite extensive, and will generally be adequate for most people's needs. It covers tools (and there's a lot!), wheel truing, fixing flat tires, adjustments for comfort, brakes, chains, pedals, derailleur adjustment, and cleaning/lubrication.<br />There are plenty of good colour photos, it is well written and very informative - what more could you ask for? If you haven't actually flicked through this book and you're still having doubts about getting it, go to your local bookshop and just have a look through it, you'll see what I mean.

If you've ever really &quot;researched&quot; (for want of a better word) before buying a nice wheelset, you'll already know more &quot;tricks&quot; than this book will tell you.<br />I give it 2 stars, and the only reason I didn't give it one star was because it is entitled: &quot;The bicycle Wheel&quot; not &quot;The ultimate bicycle wheel&quot;. Actually I've changed my mind - I'm giving it one star, because it should cover ALL aspects of the bicycle wheel and it certainly doesn't cover lightweight wheels.	2002-05-01
US	38630671	R11WNILB2LZ6FV	1579541992	740882783	The Complete Book of Long-Distance Cycling: Build the Strength, Skills, and Confidence to Ride as Far as You Want	Books	5	31	33	N	N	This is the best $ I ever spent (seriously!)	First let me say that I'm not a beginner, I've been riding for 8 years (no not all in one go!). This book taught me so so much. Thankyou to both Ed Burke & Ed Pavelka!! I thought I knew a lot, until now that is. I've bought other cycling books, before but nothing compares to this one. There is no \\"filler\\" in this book.<br />This book is not just concerned with ultralong distance races, it uses words like \\"the event\\" and \\"personal goals\\". You can read it and not feel too ashamed that you're not a pro, if you know what I mean. It caters for everyone. It also has a humurous style, which will make it enjoyable reading. It is very easy to pick up and start reading anywhere.<br />It has chapters on nutrition, stretching, off-season training, lots on training and technique...and that HYDRATION is the key.<br />Two things that this book lacks:<br />1) I prefer to use the word \\"Intentions\\" rather than \\"Goals\\".<br />It just sounds better. Use whatever word will make you feel motivated. Not much wrong there though, right?<br />The second thing is this: Ed & Ed (the authors) give you lots of tips (e.g: about how to maximise your time on the bike when you have other important things in your life; get everything ready for a ride the night before; how to cycle efficiently, etc)<br />2) But, the ONLY thing I can think that they forgot to include is this: you should make a long list of all the places you can ride to or that you want to ride to but you haven't ridden to yet - then write down how far each ride is, roughly how long it will take, etc. That way you can easily see at a glance whether you have got the time to go for that particular ride. Plus you can tick each place off as you get to it. Or alternatively you could stick pins in a map - it gives you a sense of accomplishment!<br />Great book, once again, and you can tell that both Authors have a lifetime of riding experience to share with you.<br />My favourite line in the book, talking about people who are past their prime and then quit altogether, is this: \\"They hang up their bikes and live on memories.\\"<br />One more thing: I started out highlighting all the good bits. By the time I got to the end, I realised I should have just bought some fluorescent paint and dipped the whole book in!!hen quit altogether, is this: \\"They hang up their bikes and live on memories.\\"<br />One more thing: I started out highlighting all the good bits.
