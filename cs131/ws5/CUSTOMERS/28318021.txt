He travels through some of the most forbidding locales in some of the world's poorest countries; and he travels alone, without a cell phone or internet connection, and without a plan.<br /><br />Along the way he makes many literary references, mostly to Conrad's Heart of Darkness, which he reads over and over again.  There are also some entertaining encounters with Nobel laureates, Naguib Mafouz at the beginning of his journey and Nadine Gordimer at the end.<br /><br />Theroux describes the poverty and depravation of what he sees, which he claims is worse now than it was 40 years ago when he was a Peace Corps volunteer.  Over the past 40 years, Africa has undergone urbanization just like the rest of the world.  Today about 75% of Africa's population live in urban areas, many in squatter settlements on the outskirts of cities.  Theroux writes: \\"Even at their best, African cities seemed to me miserable impoverished anthills, attracting the poor and desparate from the bush and turning them into theives and devisers of cruel scams.\\"<br /><br />As people leave the villages, the civil society of the tribal life disappears altogether.  And since there are no jobs in the city, scamming and theivery become the only means of survival.  The only thing standing in their way are the local police, who Theroux claims are no more than \\"licensed theives\\" themselves.<br /><br />Theroux has some very uncharitable opinions about much of what he sees in Africa, many other writers have described these conditions as well.  However, he unleashes most of his vitriol at the foreign aid workers.  He refers to them as \\"in general oafish self-dramatizing pigs, and often complete bastards.\\"<br /><br />It is not off the mark to criticize the foreign aid bureaucracy as it exits today in Africa.  It is true that aid corrupts both donors and recipients.  Aid programs have turned African problems into permanent conditions.  If the streets were lined with beggars before, the beggars now expect such aid with a sense of entitlement.  I think, however, that Theroux goes overboard in attributing most of Africa's problems to foreign aid, especially when he writes that the sharpest lesson foreign aid workers could teach is to turn their backs and go home.<br /><br />Abandoning Africa as Theroux suggests is not the answer.  A more hopeful, but controversial, approach is outlined in Jeffrey Sach's \\"The End of Poverty.\\"  Africa will need more aid in the future, not less.  Africa needs economic development so that they can reach \\"the first rung of the economic ladder.\\"  This means going beyond the subsistence level of the village, which Theroux romanticizes, and producing goods for export which will allow them to participate in the current wave of globalization.  Only when they reach this level of development should anyone speak realistically about reducing foreign aid.<br /><br />The way aid is currently administered it constitutes a large portion of revenue for many African governments.  And when governments get their revenues from abroad, and do not draw their revenues from the commerce and industry of their citizens, they usually take little interest in their citizens.  The result is always corrupt a government and an impoverish citizenry.  Many of the Arab countries in the Middle East that derive most of their revenue from oil are facing similar problems.<br /><br />Although it is true that aid has not accomplished much in Africa in the last 40 years, it would be a tragedy to withdraw it at this point.  Aid must be administered in a way that would enable Africans to participate in the global economy rather than being its victims.  This is no small task, outsiders have thus far been unable to change things no matter how good their intentions.  Even with aid, Theroux is correct when he says that only Africans are capable of making a difference in Africa.	2005-10-07

He gained notoriety - aside from writing 30 plus books - as the court-appointed mediator in the Microsoft case.  And if that weren't enough, he is the most frequently cited American legal scholar, making his own list (number 70) of the top 100 American public intellectuals.  Henry Kissinger is number 1.<br /><br />Posner claims to have taken the term \\"public intellectual\\" from Russell Jacoby's 1987 book \\"The Last Intellectuals.\\"  Jacoby's study was a jeremiad lamenting the disappearance of the urban, bohemian and independent intellectuals.  Posner, on the other hand, has written a completely different kind of book.<br /><br />Posner's fields of expertise are law and economics, and he has written several books on the economic analysis of law and justice.  In this book, he attempts to do a market analysis of intellectual ideas, and finds that intellectuals are not held accountable to the laws of the market.  He is dismayed at the fact that intellectuals are not held accountable for their mistakes.  \\"Quality controls that one finds in other markets for goods and services\\" do not apply to public intellectuals. When constructing a supply and demand chart as it applies to intellectuals, he wonders why works of certain scholars who have been hopelessly wrong in their predictions - Francis Fukuyama, Lester Thurow, John Kenneth Galbraith,for example - continue to top the sales charts. Why, he asks, do people continue to read their books?<br /><br />The answer that Posner provides for his own question is that people don't listen to intellectuals much anyway.  And the people that do listen are believers already.  Intellectuals are selling credence goods, they are preaching to the choir. Ultimately, because of this, intellectuals have very little influence on the issues of the day.<br /><br />Notwithstanding the fact that his economic model does not explain intellectual debate, Posner goes on to criticize a wide range of intellectuals in various fields in which he has no expertise.  Posner is obviously brilliant, but he can also be exasperating and contradictory.  He criticizes public intellectuals, who are experts in their fields, for debating issues in the public domain which they know very little about.  His critcisms suffer from the same shallowness that he attributes to others.  Many of the reviewers of this book thought it was a satire.  You have to ask yourself, what was he thinking?<br /><br />His main criterion for making the list of the top 100 public intellectuals was the number of media citations received, in other words, the popularity of the work as opposed to its quality.  This is exactly the kind of commercialism and careerism that Jacoby was warning against.  This book is a good illustration of why Posner's economic and statistical models of intellectual \\"goods and sevices\\" are misguided.  When intellectuals enter public debate to express their ideas they are entering uncharted territory, there are no experts of the unknown.  Ideas are part of an ongoing debate, they are not something to be purchased and consumed.<br /><br />Posner has expressed himself poorly in this work, but undoubtedly his books will continue to be read because he continues to contribute to and enliven contemporary debates.ate, Posner goes on to criticize a wide range of intellectuals in various fields in which he has no expertise.

After being roundly criticized by the critics and by history itself, he has since then qualified his thesis.  He now believes that even though politically and economically we have reached the final destination, so to speak, science will continue to progress and pose new problems.<br /><br />\\"Our Posthuman Future\\" is divided into three parts: the first deals with the latest developments in biotechnology, the second part is a philosophical examination of what it means to be human, and the third part sets forth some policy recommendations for controling some of the potentially dangerous consequences of biotechnology.<br /><br />Fukuyama looks at the main areas of the biotech revolution that will have an enormous impact on life as we know it.  Neuropharmacologists have created drugs such as Prozac and Ritlin that are being used to control behavioural problems that in the past were solved by self-discipline and concentrated effort.  When human beings are using psychotropic drugs to correct or enhance their behaviours, they are missing out, according to Fukuyama, on critical experiences that make them human.<br /><br />Genetic engineering also poses some of the most complex and troublesome questions.  Gene alteration could prolong life, create \\"designer babies,\\" determine sex, physique, and IQ.  On the downside, genetic manipulation could \\"embed one generation's social preferences,\\" or it could increase inequality if only the rich could afford it.  Imagine a future in which there are rich countries with many people living well over a hundred and poor countries with exploding populations of people whose median age is in the twenties.  The potential for global instability becomes ever greater.<br /><br />The second part of the book centers on the philosophical problems of human nature and human rights.  Fukuyama argues that in order to oppose these dangerous developments we must return the universal notion of naturalism or natural rights.  Naturalism claims that there is an intrinsic universal human nature and that ethics, and therefore human rights can be derived from it.  Those opposing this view call it the naturalistic fallacy.  (Hume said that we cannot derive an \\"ought\\" from an \\"is.\\")  Opponents claim that human nature can only be expressed in the context of historically contingent societies.  This is the old nature vs nurture debate, and Fukuyama falls squarely on the side of nature.  If nurture or culture is the defining aspect of human nature then biothech expands unfettered.  Fukuyama claims that human nature is a universal essence - which he conveniently fails to define - from which it is possible not only to understand human dignity, but also to develop a doctrine of human rights.<br /><br />But how does one defend human nature if it is malleable and alterable?  Science has its own imperatives, business has its own imperatives, and the consumer has his or her own imperatives.  Biotechnology will continue to advance and a static notion of human nature will continue to be tested.<br /><br />In the final part of the book, Fukuyama recommends a governmental regulatory board that on the one hand must ensure the advancement of science and on the other hand must preserve human dignity.  Societies that are on the verge of a posthuman future need to start debating more seriously what will be allowed and what will be forbidden.  A microcosm of this debate would be the debate on abortion, one side arguing the fetus' right to life and the other side the right of the mother to control her own body.  The debate on future biotech issues will no doubt be equally acrimonious and divisive.  I highly recommend this book as a primer for this debate.part of the book centers on the philosophical problems of human nature and human rights.

US	28318021	R1IHU2J6NFAZSZ	0691123357	373262786	Irrational Exuberance	Books	4	11	12	N	N	Anatomy of a Speculative Bubble	\\"Irrational Exuberance\\" is an expression that was actually coined by Robert J Shiller, and was used in his briefing of Alan Greenspan in 1996 before the Chairman of the Federal Reserve immortalized it in a public setting.  The expression was used as a warning against a possible speculative bubble in stock market prices.  As we know now, the market continued to climb until 2000 when it collapsed.  The first edition was published just before the dramatic fall of the market, making Shiller somewhat of a guru of speculative bubbles.<br /><br />Shiller points out that the Dow Jones had gone from 3,600 in 1994 to 11,700 in 2,000; the price-earnings ratio had reached an incredible 44.3.  When the stock market crashed in 1929 the p-e ratio was at 32.6.  By 1932 the market had lost 80% of its value. As we have seen, the bubble of 1929 pales in comparison to the bubble of 2000.<br /><br />Traditional financial theory assumes that people act rationally when they make investment decisions.  Investors ideally examine financial statements, calculate returns, evaluate economic factors, and then determine whether to buy or sell.<br /><br />Shiller is an economist who specializes in behavioural finance and thus tends to emphasize cultural and psychological factors that cause people to invest in assets that have risen over and above levels justified by rational theory.<br /><br />He identifies twelve factors that have led to the bubble in 2000:<br /><br />1) The fall of the Berlin Wall and China's shift to a market economy, which led to the triumph of capitalism.<br /><br />2) People are more materialistic than they were in the past.  According to polls, everyone wants to get rich.<br /><br />3) New technologies led people to believe that they were at the dawn of a new age prosperity.<br /><br />4) Monetary policies encouraged a bubble rather than choking it off.<br /><br />5) It was believed that the impact of the baby boomers on the market would be profound and lasting.<br /><br />6) There was more media coverage of people getting rich during the boom, thus creating a \\"positive feedback loop.\\"<br /><br />7) The analysts were giving positive reviews of stocks, not because of fundamentals, but because the stocks were being underwritten by their employers.<br /><br />8) Pension funds were speculating in the market trying to get better returns than the traditional fixed rate.<br /><br />9) The enormous growth of mutual funds fueled the boom.<br /><br />10) The persistence of low inflation was a factor.<br /><br />11) The introduction of online trading expanded the opportunities for speculation.<br /><br />12) The general mentality of casino society has set in with the huge increase of gambling.<br /><br />With the publication of the second edition of his book, Shiller argues that many of these factors are at work in the real estate market boom.  The prices of US homes have increased 52% from 1997 to 2004.  Historically this is unprecedented.  Today people are speculating in the real estate market like they did in stocks in the 1990's, and much like the stock market, the phenomenon is global.  It is happening in London, Vancouver, Moscow, Shanghai, and elsewhere.  All the indicators of a speculative bubble are present.<br /><br />The problem I have with this book is that Shiller tries to explain increase in market value only in terms of psychology, and fails to take into account the real value that has been added on a scale unprecedented in history.  Globalization, as Thomas Friedman describes it in \\"The World is Flat,\\" has created new and lasting efficiencies in the global economy that resulted from the internet and other technologies.  Even though technology stocks crashed in 2000, the internet and all of its benefits did not disappear, it in fact supercharged the global economy.  The Dow Jones is almost back to where it was five years ago.<br /><br />Shiller, however, is cautious about predicting a similar collapse of the housing market.  He does warn against the false belief that home prices will inexorably increase because of growing populations and widening prosperity. Instead he advises to diversify into many classes of assets to dilute risk.<br /><br />This book does not advise you to sell your home or any other property you may own, nor does it give any specific investment advice; it does, however, give an excellent overview of all the indicators of a speculative bubble.o diversify into many classes of assets to dilute risk.

Samantha Power tells the story of a Polish-Jewish lawyer named Raphael Lemkin who coined the word \\"genocide\\" in 1946.  Lemkin, who had lost all but four of his relatives in the Holocaust, had come to the United Nations to force the idea of genocide on the UN's agenda, and to persuade the world body the establish an international law that would lead to its prevention and punishment.  The law was passed in 1948, but was not ratified by the United States until 40 years later.  The reason for this delay is that the word \\"genocide\\" would commit the US to action, whereas if mass killings were described in a more circumspect way, the US could always find reasons to avoid action.<br /><br />Power chronicles some of the major acts of genocide that were committed in the 20th century.  Starting with the Turkish slaughter of Armenians in Turkey during World War I, then going on to Cambodia, Iraq, the Balkans, and finally Rwanda where Hutu militias slaughtered about 800,000 Tutsis in 100 days.  Power also chronicles the failure of Western powers, especially the United States, to intervene.<br /><br />Power's study was motivated by the belated response of the Clinton Administration to the killings in Bosnia.  She was a freelance journalist at the time and recounts some of the cynical and lame remarks made by officials while 200,000 Bosnians were being killied.  It was Warren Christopher who called genocide \\"a problem from hell,\\" providing her with a title for her study.  Western powers did nothing between 1992 and 1995 during which time museums to memorialize the Holocaust were opened with Clinton using the solemn phrase \\"never again.\\"  Well, it did happen again, and under his watch.<br /><br />During this period, genocide was being committed in Rwanda, which Power described as \\"the fastest, most efficient killing spree of the 20th century.\\" This would have been easier to stop than the one in Bosnia, yet no US troops were sent nor were UN reinforcements authorized.  There were no high-level meetings in the US nor were there public condemnations.  The safest response was to look the other way.<br /><br />Power argues that although the public and elected officials express moral outrage at genocide, the failure to respond is a systemic failure of the American political system.  It is not just the Clinton Administration that failed in Bosnia and Rwanda, it has always been the case as far back as the Turkish genocide of Armenians.  For the US to intervene militarily for humanitarian purposes the elected officials must have public support.  If there is no public support, and there almost never is, the military is reluctant to act.  If the military is reluctant, the political classes are reluctant to push for action for fear that it will cost them the next election.  Similarly, foreign policy and national security officials are timid in advocating humanitarian intervention for fear of being branded as profligate public spenders.  The Clinton Administration was evasive on Rwanda because it was still smarting from its disastrous episode in Somalia.  In the end, it is always safer for the public official to err on the side of caution and thrift.<br /><br />Many Americans believe that it is not our responsiblity to stop the murder of foreigners.  \\"We don't have a dog in that fight,\\" as James Baker characterized it.  Power argues that the ideals on which this country is founded requires us to act against genocide.  Public support for action, while important, should not be the determining factor.  It is more effective if a prominent politician puts his or her reputation on the line and takes up the cause.  In 1995, two weeks before the Srebrenica massacre, Bob Dole called for a lifting of the arms embargo on the Bosnian Muslims.  Dole's leadership forced Clinton into action, unfortunately it was a case of too little, too late.  Bob Dole, however, did not have a dog in the fight in Rwanda and remained silent.  Again, it was safer to do nothing.<br /><br/>This book was written before America's intervention in Iraq, but it has surprisingly not been invoked, to my knowledge, by the Bush Administration as a rationale for American unilateralism, which Power in fact is advocating.  If the US, for example, had intervened militarily in the genocide in the Darfur region of Sudan, it would have been the correct action, and I believe the world would have seen it as such.  The intervention in Iraq was done for a number of evolving reasons (prevention of genocide was not one of them), and as a result we are still the subject of the world's opprobrium.<br /><br />Power is right to advocate unilateral American action in the face of genocide, but at the same time, America must not abandon international institutions, despite their inadequacies, and not promote itself as guardian of the international order. As this book has shown, America has not been a very reliable guardian in the past.ntion in Iraq, but it has surprisingly not been invoked, to my knowledge, by the Bush Administration as a rationale for American unilateralism, which Power in fact is advocating.

The National Security Council is an executive body within the White House that includes cabinet level officials involved in diplomacy and defense. Rothkopf's account is about the key players that were responsible for the successes and failures of the National Security Council's management of America's foreign policy since the end of World War II.<br /><br />Rothkopf's insider credentials are impressive: he is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations, he was under-secretary of commerce during the Clinton Administration, he served as managing  director of Kissinger and Associates, he also served as Chairman and CEO of Intellibridge, and he is currently visiting scholar at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.<br /><br />There is an interesting section in this book called \\"Two Degrees of Henry Kissinger,\\" which shows that the 13 national security advisors (NSAs) that followed Kissinger have either worked with him, for him, or worked with or for one of the members of his staff.<br /><br />After Nixon was elected President, Kissinger was appointed NSA.  Kissinger not only assembled one of the most talented teams in the history of the NSC (Lawrence Eagleberger, Anthony Lake, Alexander Haig, Brent Scowcroft, and Robert MacFarlane), he also took control, either directly or indirectly, of all the interagency policy groups.  Kissinger was Nixon's entire inner circle in matters of foreign policy.<br /><br />When the Watergate scandel broke, Nixon became distracted and virtually left Kissinger to his own devices.  As a result, Kissinger may have been the most powerful non-elected official in American history and certainly every NSA since has operated in his shadow.<br /><br />The title of this book \\"Running the World\\" is more than a little pretentious.  As has been noted by other reviewers, it is an account of the old boys network written by an old boy and tends toward self-importance.  A more accurate and humble title would have been the one I chose for this review: \\"Global Crisis Management.\\"  The NSC does not run the world.  The NSC, which consists of the senior cabinet members and White House staff members, is more than likely trying to control crises as they occur than trying to direct the course of events.  And as Rothkopf makes clear, the response to a given crisis depends very much on the personalities of the members who are in the president's favor at the given moment.<br /><br />Rothkopf is very critical of the current Bush Administration's track record.  He argues that they have lost sight of the liberal internationalist values set forth by Truman at the end of World War II when the council was founded.  At the time, the US enjoyed a position of power that was not unlike its position after 9/11. The Truman Adminsistration established international institutions that deferred America's power to the good of international system.  The Bush Administration, under the sway of Cheney, Rumsfeld, and other neoconservatives, decided to reassert American national interest through the use of military force, the consequences of which we are still suffering today.<br /><br />Critics of this book have called Rothkopf an apologist for the Clinton administration.  Far from it, Rothkopf has enumerated the foreign policy disasters that occured during Clinton's watch: namely, the failures in Somalia, Bosnia, Haiti, and Rwanda.  The picture that Rothkopf paints of the NSC is not one that runs the world but rather one that tries to maintain the status quo in the  face of an ever-changing world.ttle pretentious.

US	28318021	R2NEYJ92UQHTLS	006073132X	150560620	Freakonomics: A Rogue Economist Explores the Hidden Side of Everything	Books	3	20	21	N	N	Unconventional Wisdom	Just as the economist John Kenneth Galbraith is credited with coining the term, \\"conventional wisdom,\\" and elevating it to the level of a concept; Steven D Levitt and Stephen J Dubner can be credited with their counter-intuitive findings as being the champions of \\"unconventional wisdom.\\"<br /><br />This book has no unifying theme nor does it really have a beginning or an ending.  It is really a series of vignettes, a \\"treasure hunt\\", as the authors say, in which they \\"follow whatever freakish curiousities that may occur\\" to them.  The chapter titles are all in the form of questions and illustrate the disjointedness of the topics.  If there is a common thread that runs through the entire book it would have to be the question of what motivates people.  Freakonomics, if it is anything, it is the study of incentives.<br /><br />Levitt and Dubner ask the question, \\"What Do Schoolteachers and Sumo Wrestlers Have in Common?\\"  The answer is that incentives that were intended for these groups to perform better actually caused them to cheat.  Standardizd testing, which was designed to hold schools accountable for their students' performance, has unintentionally driven teachers to \\"assist\\" the students in getting better test scores.  Likewise in sumo wrestling,  contestants must win 8 of 15 matches in order to advance to the finals.  In this close-knit group, contestants who already have 8 victories will let their opponent with 7 victories win so they can both advance.  In return, the wrestler who conceded the match will expect the same favor in return in the finals.<br /><br />\\"Why Do Crack Dealers Live With Their Mom?\\" ask our freakonomists.  The short answer is that they can't afford to move out of the house.  The long answer is that an economist spent four years embedded in a Chicago crack gang trying to understand their business model.  This economist produced an organizational chart of the gang and reconstructed four years worth of profit and loss statements.  The statements showed that the lowest member of a crack gang earned about $3.30  an hour.<br /><br />\\"How is the Ku Klux Klan Like a Group of Real-Estate Agents?\\"  Their freakish answer is that both groups derive their power from hoarding information.  What?  I can see how real-estate agents hoard the information that is necessary to do a deal, but the Klan?  The Klan does not gain power from hiding information, they hide information to protect themselves.  Their power comes from their ability to instill hatred in their members. Whatever secrets the Klan leaders may have, they do not affect the attitudes of their members.<br /><br />Another controversial theory that Levitt and Dubner put forth is that states that have legalized abortions have shown a decrease in crime rates (New York and California).  They found that most of the women that were getting abortions were poor and single, precisely the group most likely to raise children that become criminals.

What?  I can see how real-estate agents hoard the information that is necessary to do a deal, but the Klan?  The Klan does not gain power from hiding information, they hide information to protect themselves.  Their power comes from their ability to instill hatred in their members. Whatever secrets the Klan leaders may have, they do not affect the attitudes of their members.    Another controversial theory that Levitt and Dubner put forth is that states that have legalized abortions have shown a decrease in crime rates (New York and California).  They found that most of the women that were getting abortions were poor and single, precisely the group most likely to raise children that become criminals.

Hitchens writes the following: \\"Jefferson is one of the figures in our history whose absence simply cannot be imagined: his role in the expansion and definition of the United States is too considerable, even at the distance, to be reduced by the passage of time.\\"<br /><br />Jefferson makes his first appearance in the book as a revolutionary with truly revolutionary ideas: government is best invented by the people, people with \\"inalienable rights.\\"  Defining the limits of government and establishing the concept of human rights for the first time in history was in no small part due to Jefferson's input and authorship of the Declaration of Independence.  Hitchens gives some excellent discussion on some of the influences on Jefferson's thinking: mostly British sources such as Thomas Paine, John Locke, and John Milton.<br /><br />At the writing of the first draft of the Declaration of Independence, Jefferson recognized the inherent contradiction between the idealism of human rights and the existence of slavery.  In fact, Jefferson wrote a paragraph for the first draft condemning slavery, but it was expunged by the overseeing committee in deference to the southern slave-trading states.  Indeed after inheriting a 5,000 acre plantation (Monticello) from his aristocratic mother, Jefferson himself became a slaveholder and eventually abandoned his youthful idealism.  Later in life, he would become an advocate of states rights, which became the political cover for the pro-slavery faction.<br /><br />The contradictions that were Jefferson's were also those of the United States.  The country \\"committed gross wrongs and crimes, as well as upheld great values and principles,\\" writes Hitchens.<br /><br />Jefferson's presidency included many achievements that would permanently change the outlook and geography of the United States: the Barbary Wars against pirates on the coast of North Africa, the Louisiana Purchase and the Lewis and Clark Expedition. (The latter two drives to expand American borders were very contradictory for a person who advocated an agrarianism that stood in opposition to centralized federal government.)  However, the most serious blemish to his legacy as president was his opposition to the Missouri Compromise, which was an attempt to limit slavery in the newly acquired territories in the west.  Jefferson's refusal to take on the slavery issue no doubt paved the way for the tragedy that was the Civil War.  It was then that Lincoln took up the idealism of the youthful Jefferson by declaring that this nation was a nation \\"conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.\\"<br /><br />Perhaps Hitchens has been a little too fair with Jefferson, it would have been totally justified to savage him just like the others.he would become an advocate of states rights, which became the political cover for the pro-slavery faction.

Thanks to Nicholas Ostler, PHD in linguistics from MIT, we now have such a book.  Not only was I not disappointed, it exceded even my wildest dreams.  It takes great knowledge and audacity to undertake this project, and Ostler has both.<br /><br />This work focuses mainly on languages that have been widely influential.  The first part of the book, starting 5,300 years ago, describes the spread of languages by land, from 3,300 BC up to the Middle Ages.  The second part is an account of the spread of European languages as they conquered and colonized the world by sea.  In the last part of the book, Ostler makes some predictions as to which languages will dominate in the coming century.<br /><br />Instead of trying to summarize the book - which would be impossible in this space - I will highlight some of the more interesting points.<br /><br />1)Why did Latin or one of its vernacualars not take root in England as it did in Italy, France, Spain, and Portugal?  After all they were all domains of the Roman Empire.  And why did Anglo-Saxon take root in England and nowhere else?  Ostler speculates that most of the population died out from the plague leaving a linguistic void for the conquering Anglo-Saxons.  However, there is no one determinent that will guarantee a language's staying power: factors include conquest, migration, economic power, and religion.<br /><br />2)Why did Greek survive long after Greek civilization disappeared? It became a language of learning and prestige during the Roman Empire, and also latter in Constantinople during the Byzantium era. In a sense, it has parallels with Hebrew.  Hebrew was not a vernacular from 100 BC until the 20th century, it survived mainly as a liturgical language, a language of learning.<br /><br />3)In an excellent chapter called \\"The Triumphs of Fertility,\\" Ostler compares Egyptian and Chinese.  Both are rather cumbersome and unwieldy pictographic languages, but this also served as a unifying force in civlilizations with many mutually unintelligible dialects.  Chinese and Egyptian civilizations were highly centralized with densely populated heartlands.  Hence, their tremendous fertility prevented invading languages from overtaking them for thousands of years.  Chinese is still with us today, but Egyptian was finally conquered by Arabic around 700 AD.<br /><br />4)Sanskrit and Arabic are examples of languages that spread by being bearers of major religions.  Arabic spread quickly across the Arabian peninsula and across North Africa through conquest.  Arabic did not supplant the dominant languages of what are now Turkey and Iran, but both Turkish and Persian retain many Arabic words.  It is a belief of devout Muslims that God's truth will only be revealed in Arabic, thus giving great impetus to its study.  Sanskrit, which Ostler affectionately calls the \\"charming creeper,\\" spread, not by conquest, but more by seduction and by organic growth.  Sanskrit, as the language of Hinduism, gradually established itself in the subcontinent and latter in Southeast Asia.  Today, however, only the vernaculars of Sanskrit are mainly spoken, Sanskrit itself has only about 200,000 speakers left.<br /><br />5)After 1500, the European powers and languages began expanding by sea.  Ostler gives accounts of why Portuguese, Spanish, French, Dutch, and English established themselves in some places but not others.  In most cases, where the conquering language takes root is where entire families migrate and establish themselves in the rural areas, away from the imperial center.  The English in America, Australia, and Canada, as well as the Portuguese in Brazil are examples of this axiom.  This is why English did not do well in, say, India nor Portuguese in Indonesia.<br /><br />This book is simply a tour de force.  Ostler asks all the right questions and answers them very judiciously.  After reading it you will start to think of the future in terms of which languages will be spoken.em very judiciously.

Imagine an island chain as broad as the continental US.  It is the world's most populous Muslim nation, and the fourth largest in the overall rankings.  It is a nation of countless ethnic groups and one that has more than 350 spoken languages.<br /><br />Theodore Friend has written an equally monumental and multifaceted work that reflects the kaleidscopic richness of Indonesia.  He interviews not only presidents and generals, but ordinary people as well - people living their lives in  characteristic Indonesian fashion, with grace under pressure.  Friend gives very scholarly analyses of political events, religious thought, and the ebbs and flows of the economy.  At times one gets the impression that this is a traveloge complete with photographs (over 100); clearly Friend has a great love for his subject.<br /><br />The book roughly falls into three sections covering the last half century of Indonesian history: Sukarno (1945-65), Suharto (1965-98), and the Successors (Habibie,Whahid, and Sukarnoputri {1998-2002}).  With the Cold War over, Friend is able to give us a more balanced look at the presidencies of Sukarno and Suharto. It is no longer sufficient to view the first as the bad guy and the second as the good guy. Minus the Cold War prism the realities are much more subtle. Sukarno, for his part, was up against an immense number of competing forces: a power hungry army, a Communist party, a restless Islamic movement, and the various ethnic and separatist groups that wanted more autonomy.  Sukarno was a gifted orater. He was able, with the spell that he cast over his people, to shape a national ethos that spoke for many, if not all, of these competing groups.  He was able to give Indonesians a sense of national identity and dignity that they never had under the Dutch and Japanese occupations.  His downfall was controversial: some say it was corruption and economic mismanagement that caused it, others say it was a coup that was given the blessing, if not the outright support of the CIA and the Pentagon, since he was getting a little to cozy with the Communists.  Friend judiciously gives all sides of the story and lets the reader decide.<br /><br />The 1965 coup that brought Suharto to power and kept him there for the next 30 plus years was, for better or for worse,  a period of stability and development.  Friend is of the school of thought that an authoritarian figure that sacrifices democratic progress to economic progress is tolerable as a transitional figure.  Suharto, unlike Sukarno, understood basic things: namely, that people needed to eat, that they needed jobs, and that they needed education; and he was fairly successful in delivering these public goods.  During his time in power, Indonesians had three decades of economic progress.<br /><br />Friend also describes the dark side of Suharto's rule that was conveniently overlooked during the Cold War.  In his years in power, Suharto, his family, and the Javanese elite created a feudal system of corruption that exceded even the Marcos regime in its kleptocracy.  Every foreign corporation that did business in Indonesia needed to partner with a memeber of Suharto's family or one of his cronies.  The World Bank and the IMF looked the other way because Suharto kept the Communists at bay.  However, the system collapsed under its own weight during the Asian financial crisis of 1998.  Indonesia was hit particulary hard because of its inherent precariousness.<br /><br />In the last part of the book, Friend gives us some very personal and subjective descriptions of Habibie, Wahid, and Sukarnoputri. He is very sympathetic to them given the difficulties in governing Indonesia with the imperatives (destinies) of its geography, religion, and history.<br /><br />In sum Friend's view of what actually held Indonesia together for the first fifty years since independence are the following: 1) the idea of national unity, that the many diverse groups are actually one people; 2) the spread of a national language - Bahasa Indonesia - through national education; 3) the army; 4) the presidency - Sukarno for 20 years and Suharto for 30 years.f national unity, that the many diverse groups are actually one people; 2) the spread of a national language - Bahasa Indonesia - through national education; 3) the army; 4) the presidency - Sukarno for 20 years and Suharto for 30 years.	2005-08-16

In his new book, he gives us a well-written and extensively researched account of the sources of American nationalism.  The term nationalism - like empire - never quite seemed to apply to America as it did to, say, the British Empire or Dutch Empire; however, Lieven makes his case from an outsider's point of view.<br /><br />Working along the same lines as Samuel Huntington in \\"Who Are We,\\" Lieven  defines American national identity as consisting of two major trends: one is the \\"American Creed,\\" or the high idealism of American civic nationalism; and the other is the darker, angrier Anglo-Protestant core culture.  The Amercian Creed cherishes the ideals of liberty, democracy, individualism, rule of law, and the separation of church and state.  These ideals are what other countries admire about America and what immigrants embrace when they settle here.  The other trend is what Walter Russell Mead would call the Jacksonian traditon.  This strain derives from the poor white Southerners who felt victimized by having lost the Civil War.  They are populist, pugnacious, sometimes racist, and often paranoid or dismissive about foreigners and foreign countries.  Also, Lieven points out that the fundamentalist and evangelical sector of American religion finds its home in the Jacksonian tradition.<br /><br />After the events of 9/11, these two opposing traditions manifested themselves in a unique way in the Bush administration's response to terrorism.  The president's foreign policy team seemed to draw from some of the worst aspects each tradition.  On the one hand, our civic-minded enlightened selves would now go overseas to convert foreigners to the American Creed; and on the other hand, the Jacksonians among found themselves going abroad to fight and kill.<br /><br />This might be an oversimplification of the argument Lieven makes, but basically he sees these two forces at work behind our foreign policy.  Another point that he makes concerns the fundamentalist and evangelical side of the Jacksonian march abroad.  Lieven believes that one of the main things that separates America from other countries is its uncritical support of Israel, which, he believes, comes at the urging people like Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson, and other members of the Christian Right.  In fact, the Christian Zionist movement is headed by Tom DeLay.  They, along with certain key members of the Bush administration, supported the view that Israel - according to their interpretation of the Bible - was entitled to all of the occupied territories.  This is phenomenon that leaves our European allies shaking their heads.<br /><br />Granted the Bush team lacks finesse when it comes to diplomacy.  However, with all of Lieven's criticisms of America's foreign policy, one would wonder why it was so successful during the last century - after all it was the American Century.  The riposte - the one that Americans traditionally make - is that Lieven entertains many of the attitudes and myths held by politically correct Europeans.  The current European penchant for endless negotiation and failure to back diplomacy with military force is not accomplishing anything as far as international terrorism or securing energy resources is concerned.<br /><br />In all fairness, the criticisms expressed in this work have been taken into account in Bush's second term.  After setbacks in establishing democracy and wiping out terrorists in Iraq and Afghanistan, the Jacksonian impulse, not to mention the fundamentalist rhetoric of good and evil, has been greatly subdued.  America is now working with Europe to halt Iran's nuclear ambitions and endorsing the Six Party talks to do the same with North Korea.  It seems that the pugnacious American nationalism is giving way to the liberal internationalism of earlier times.  This book was a good read in that it gave many insights into the American characterfrom a British and European point of view.n character from a British and European point of view.	2005-08-15

Not only is he a graduate of West Point, a Vietnam veteran, and a conservative Catholic, he is a professor of international relations and a contributor to \\"The Weekly Standard\\" and \\"The National Review.\\"  Obviously, if he were a left-leaning anti-war Democrat and a contributor to, say, \\"The Nation,\\" he wouldn't be taken seriously as a critic of American militarism - he would be merely another \\"blame-America-first\\" defeatist.<br /><br />Bacevich sees militarism manifesting itself in some disquieting ways.  Traditionally America has always gauged the size of its military with the magnitude of impending threats.  After the Civil War, World War I and II, the military was downsized as threats receded.  Not so after the fall of the Soviet Union.  The  military budget has continued to grow and the expenditures are greater - by some measures - than all other countries combined. American military forces are now scaling the globe and the American public seems quiet comfortable with it.  And everyone else is growing uneasy.<br /><br />The mindset of the current officer corps is dominant control in all areas \\"whether sea, undersea, land, air, space or cyberspace.\\" In other words, supremacy in all theaters.  Self-restraint has given way to the normalization of using military force as a foreign policy tool.  From 1989 (Operation Just Cause) to 2002 (Operation Iraqi Freedom) there have been nine major military operations and a number of smaller ones.  The end of the Cold War has given the US a preponderance of military strength (the proverbial unipolar moment) that has enamoured successive administrations with the idea of using military force to solve international problems.  In earlier times, war was always an option of the last resort, now it is a preventative measure.<br /><br />War, according to Bacevich, has taken on a new aesthetic.  During World War I and II, and also Vietnam and Korea the battlefield was a slaughterhouse of barbarism and brutality.  Now, with the advent of the new Wilsonianism in Washington, wars are seen as moments of national unity to carry out a positive agenda, almost as if it were international social work.<br /><br />The modern soldier is no longer looked upon as a deadbeat or a grunt, but rather as a skilled professional who is undertaking socially beneficial work.  In fact, in a poll taken in 2003, military personnel consider themselves as being of higher moral standards than the nation they serve.<br /><br />In the political classes, the Republicans have traditionallly been staunchly pro-military, but now even Democrats have thrown off their ant-military inclinations.  When Kerry was running for president he did not question Bush's security policies, he was actually arguing that Bush had not gone far enough.  Kerry wanted to invest more in military hardware and training.  Even liberal Michael Ignatieff argues that US military intervention should be used to lessen the plight of the oppressed and that we should be  assisting them in establishing more representative government.<br /><br />But superpowers are not altruistic; they are only altruistic to the extent that it serves their self-interest.  That's  probably why Ignatieff will not get much of a hearing and Bacevich will.  This book should give us pause as to why the range of opinion in the America on the use of military force is so narrow.

I say almost because there is a small clique that believes that petroleum will indefinitely ooze up from the earth's core, but that's another matter.  In the known world there are a finite number of proven reserves, and Saudi Arabia is believed to possess the largest number of these reserves - some 250 billion barrels or a quarter of the world's total.  And, to their credit, the Saudis have always been very reliable and responsible producers: when there were global shortages, they could always be counted on to alleviate the shortages by producing more oil.<br /><br />Therein lies the problem according to Matthew Simmons, investment banker and oil industry analyst.  In his new book,\\"Twilight in the Desert,\\" he explains why increasing production to avert supply disruptions diminishes the reserves' long-term productive capacity.  To keep up with soaring demand, the Saudis have been using a variety of methods the increase well pressure - such as pumping water into wells.  This boosts production temporarily, but it leaves far more of the oil unrecoverable than if it were extracted at a steady and lower rate.<br /><br />The fact that the Saudis are using these methods on all of their seven largest fields indicates that their production is peaking or beyond the peak - a claim which they deny.  Truth be told, most of the major Saudi fields (Ghawar, Safaniya, Abquaiq, Berri, Zuluf, and Marjan) were developed 40 to 50 years ago, and no sizeable field has been discovered since 1967 (Hatwah).  In 1988,  the Saudis claimed that they still had 250 billion barrels in reserve and now - 50 billion barrels later - they still claim to have 250 billion barrels in reserve. Something is amiss.  True, calculating reserves is an inexact science, but what troubles Simmons is that the Saudis never allow third party verification.<br /><br />The world's petroleum requirement in 2001 was 77 million barrels per day, by 2025 it will be 121 million barrels a day, a net increase of 44 million barrels a day.  Of this increase, the Saudis are projected to supply one-fourth, roughly 12 million more barrels per day than they are producting now.  Simmons sees the chances of this happening as very slim, since 90 percent of all the oil Saudi Arabia has ever produced came from the seven giant fields.  These fields are now mature and diminishing after have been injected with massive amounts of water over the decades.<br /><br />Unfortunately, America's entire energy  strategy is based on the Saudis meeting their projections in the years ahead.  Simmon's view is a minority view, but it it is based on technical papers available from the online library of the Society of Petroleum Engineers.  He makes a convincing argument that the future costs of securing oil will increase significantly.  Not only the costs of more intensive recovery efforts, but also costs associated with military operations to secure resources and the costs of the ecological degradation of burning 77 million barrels of oil per day.  This book is an important addition to the growing chorus of voices calling for energy conservation and the urgent need to find alternative sources of energy.s a day, a net increase of 44 million barrels a day.

This paradigm, according to journalist Robert Merry, will show us where we've gone wrong and how to rectify our course.  This book is very well written and very well researched, but some of the conclusions he reaches are problematic.<br /><br />The idea of progress was a product of the Enlightenment.  The main thesis is that humanity is progressing inexorably from backwardness and ignorance to higher stages of enlightenment, and that the process would go on indefinitely into the future.  Exponents of the Englightenment believed their values to be universal.  The most recent intellectual manifestation of this idea was expounded by Francis Fukuyama in \\"The End of History,\\" written shortly after the demise of the Soviet Union.  He believed that liberal democracy and capitalism were the ends to which all civlizations strived and that the goal had been reached.  There would be no more conflicts between major powers or as Thomas Friedman said in \\"The Lexus and the Olive Tree,\\" no two countries with McDonalds would ever go to war with each other.<br /><br />This illusion came quickly to an end with the conflicts in the Balkans and with 9/11.  The cultural view of history tells us that not only does history not end, but that it had come back with a vengeance.  Samuel Huntington, a champion of this view, tells us in \\"The Clash of Civilizations\\" that the world is made up of different cultures, values, and traditions, none of which is superior to the others and none of which encompasses universal values.<br /><br />Merry is a conservative and an endorser of the cultural view of history, and he has some harsh things to say about liberals as well as the Bush Administration.  He believes that the Clinton Administration's military intervention in the Balkans to save Muslims was a big mistake since it did not directly affect our national interests.  The Bush Administration's military intervention in Iraq to transplant democracy was even worse.  According to Merry, Muslims have no traditon of democracy and to force it upon them will only encourage them to hate us more.<br /><br />Merry does not believe that there is a war within Islamic civilization between moderates and extremists, and that the West should be assisting the so-called moderates.  Instead, we should be supporting dictatorial regimes that are suppressing Islamic fundamentalists.  Presumably this would have included Saddam Hussein.  According to the cultural theory of history, there are certain unalterables in Islamic civilization that the West has no business trying to change.  Islam should be fenced off and we should be supporting the oppressors.<br /><br />A refutation of Merry's view can be illustrated by the example of Japan.  Prior to World War II, the Japanese were illiberal and isolated from the West; they wanted Western technology, but they didn't want to be contaminated by Western culture.  However, since then, they have quite seemlessly absorbed many Western cultural values while at the same time retaining their own traditional culture.  Inspite of Merry's very learned argument, I think he came down on the wrong side of the debate.  Indeed the example of Japan shows the insufficiency of the progress/culture paradigm itself.  Reality is always more complex than the paradigm that tries to understand it; it has led Merry to some very dangerous conclusions.  Nevertheless, I would recommend this book for the insights it gives as to why countries choose to go to war.intervention in the Balkans to save Muslims was a big mistake since it did not directly affect our national interests.

Inspite of Merry's very learned argument, I think he came down on the wrong side of the debate.  Indeed the example of Japan shows the insufficiency of the progress/culture paradigm itself.  Reality is always more complex than the paradigm that tries to understand it; it has led Merry to some very dangerous conclusions.  Nevertheless, I would recommend this book for the insights it gives as to why countries choose to go to war.	2005-07-27

The 20 years prior to 1970 international reserves increased only about 55%, but since 1970, with the adoption of the dollar standard, reserves have increased over 2,000%.  This is primarily a result of US current account deficits, which last year ran about $600 billion - about 3% of GDP.  Asian central banks hold about $2 trillion US dollar-denominated reserve assets.  This surge in international reserves has created huge imbalances and it is the subject of this book by financial analyst Richard Duncan.<br /><br />The dollar standard has allowed the US to finance incredibly large deficits by printing more dollars.  The dollar standard has on the upside ushered in the age of globalization that has allowed Asian economies - first Japan, then the Tigers, and now China - to devolop by exporting to the US without importing equal amounts, leaving Asian central banks with large stockpiles of dollar reserves.  And what can Asian central banks do with these reserves?  About the only thing they can do is invest in US corporate stocks and bonds, T-bills, and US agency debt such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. (We've been enjoying low mortgage rates because the Asian central banks buy up our debt so we can take out more.)  And all these investments in return allow US consumers to buy more of their exports - call it vendor financing.<br /><br />According to Duncan, these current account deficits and current account surpluses have already wrought havoc with the world economy: it caused the asset and stock market bubble in Japan in the 1980s; it caused the currency crisis in Malaysia and Thailand in the 1990s (Duncan was an analyst working in Thailand at the time and correctly predicted its occurence); and it is currently fueling the real estate boom in the US.<br /><br />Asia's export-led strategies require that dollar reserves are reinvested in the US; this prevents their currencies from appreciating.  Indeed, if the Bank of China or the Bank of Japan were to invest in the Euro or any other currency, the bankers and politicians of those countries would quickly protest because it would drive up their currencies and make their exports less competitive.<br /><br />So then with the US increasing the world's international reserves at a rate of $600 billion a year, everyone is still happy for the time being.  Asian countries are growing rapidly and American consumers have endless supplies of credit - using their homes as ATMs - however, this imbalance, unsustainable and in the long run, will precipitate an economic crisis.  Even correcting this imbalance, if not done prudently, could precipitate a world economic slowdown.<br /><br />This book was written before the recent decision by China to stop pegging the yuan to the dollar.  This was a baby step in the right direction.<br /><br />Duncan's analysis of the problem is very good, his policy recommendations, however, are questionable.  He suggests, for example, giving global central bank status to the International Monetary Fund.  That's a nonstarter for reasons obvious to Republicans.  He also advocates a global minimum wage, giving workers more money to soak up excess supply.  I can already hear the critics screaming no \\"world government.\\"<br /><br />The main problem that needs to be addressed - and Duncan stresses it many times - is that there needs to be a regulatory mechanism in foreign-exchange markets.  Central banks intervene in currency markets for their own benefit - such creating an export strategy - instead of looking for ways to smooth global business cycles.  China, with its revaluation of its currency, is looking to become a responsible global player - we hope.  If the powers that be do not act in concert to coordinate a soft landing of the current imbalances, we will all be heading for some frightening times.are reinvested in the US; this prevents their currencies from appreciating.

George Lakoff and the folks at the Rockridge Institute are a think tank for progressive politics located in the San Francisco Bay Area, one of the last outposts of liberlism in an increasingly conservative country.  Lakoff is a professor of linguistics and cognitive science at UC Berkeley who uses some of his insights for framing the political debate in favor of the Democrats.<br /><br />It has been noted that Lakoff has been an advisor to Bill Clinton in helping him frame some of his messages.  I was thinking of it last week while listening to Clinton speak of energy independence and framing it in terms of homeland security.  It was done with exceptional skill, but Clinton is an exception on the Democratic side.<br /><br />Framing is an insight that Lakoff borrows from cognitive science, which says basically that frames are mental structures that shape the way we view the world.  They are the context which give words and phrases meaning.  Frames are the \\"cognitive unconscious,\\" not available to the conscious mind.<br /><br />One of the reasons progressives have been having trouble framing is that they believe that facts are out there and that they speak for themselves.  People, however, do not accept a fact or a truth unless it fits into the world view that they already hold.<br /><br />Lakoff advises not to fight the opponents frame; fighting it only validates it.  Progressives should come up with a new frame altogether, a progressive world view.<br /><br />Take the example of \\"tax relief.\\"  This implies that tax is a burden and that it should be lifted.  On the extreme end of the tax relief movement we have Grover Norquist calling for zero taxes. This is absurd and in effect calls for the withering away of the state.  You would think progressives would have an easy time explaining that taxes are the price we pay for civilization as we know it (education, infrastructure, common defense, etc.), and that Grover Norquist is its enemy.<br /><br />Consevatives have been outspending progressives 4-to-1 on creating media events and funding think tanks that have been developing conservative frames and planting them in the minds of the public.  Is there anyone who still does not believe that public opinion can be manipulated?  The autonomous individual is a myth that both parties entertain but at the same time they bank on its malleablity.<br /><br />In the post 9/11 era the Republican family values frame of the strict father has been working very overtime. (Notice how many times GWB telegraphs the phrase \\"war on terror\\").  The strict father views the world as a fearful and dangerous place.  In this world view, there are absolute rights and wrongs, and children must obey the father who is the moral authority.  In GWB's world view, the US is the strict father/moral authority and rogue nations are the insolent children.  France and Germany are viewed as senile elderly relatives.  The consequences of this model have been met with such charges as being an arrogant superpower, to mention one of the mildest ones.<br /><br />The nurturant family/multilateral model would be the liberal antidote in which the US would relinguish a little arrogance and work cooperatively with other great powers to bring rogue states into the international system.  Its interesting how multilateral the Bush Administration has become in the second term; could it be that they've discovered nurturant family values?<br /><br />This is a good handbook for both sides of the debate: for conservatives on how to improve their game and for progressives on how to start playing.Consevatives have been outspending progressives 4-to-1 on creating media events and funding think tanks that have been developing conservative frames and planting them in the minds of the public.

He subscribes to the more moderate and traditional Republican view of international relations known as the \\"realist\\" school.  As such he falls in line with such notables as Brent Scowcroft and Henry Kissinger.<br /><br />The realist school, indeed, derives most of its principles from Henry Kissinger who was one of the greatest practitioners of realplitik in the last century.  The foundational models of the realist school were the Congress of Vienna in 1815 and the Congress of Berlin in 1878 in which the great powers carved up Europe into spheres of influence, known as the \\"concert of Europe.\\"<br /><br />Now we have another such opportunity, says Haass.  He believes multilateralism among the great powers of today would strengthen, not compromise the United States.  The great powers he has in mind are China, Russia, Europe, Japan, and India, and in a lesser role the emerging powers of Brazil, South Korea, and South Africa.  Haass sees the world as a place where great powers in cooperation set the rules and impose them collectively on the rest.<br /><br />In Haass' view, the advocacy of democracy would play a less prominent role in foreign policy, instead, order, stablity, and cooperation would be paramount.  China and Russia would have more latitude for cracking down on dissent within in exchange for membership in the exclusive club.  At the same time, the US would not undertake expensive wars to impose regime change and democracy.  Supporting it as we did in Lebanon and Ukraine is about as far as Haass thinks we should be going.<br /><br />Imposing democracy at gunpoint and doing it unilaterally are not viable foreign policy goals.  Although it is true that we do not need a permission slip from the UN to defend ourselves, as was the case for the invasion of Afghanistan.  The case for invading Iraq has turned out to be a war of choice, one that Haass is warning against.  Even though the US has a bigger defense budget than all the great powers combined, it still has not been able to turn that power into influence.  Influence comes only through multilateralism and cooperation.<br /><br />There is really no alternative to multilateralism, as the Bush Administration is finding out in its second term.  After having lost influence from the invasion and occupation of Iraq, they are now working with Europe to halt nuclear weapons in Iran and with the Six Parties to do the same in North Korea.  In a globalizing world of cross-border flows of people, goods, money, ideas, viruses, weapons, etc., global integration is taking place no matter how desparately nations try to hold on to sovereignty. A \\"concert of international society\\" may be pie-in-the-sky, as one Amazon reviewer put it, but it is important to have clear guideposts because the pie-on-earth is already in the making.  This is a very thoughtful book that I would recommend to the general reader as well as to the policy wonk.be a war of choice, one that Haass is warning against.

Everyone has a story about how incredibly real estate prices have risen and how someone has made a killing.  Nowhere is this phenomenon more over the top than in Manhattan.<br /><br />Steven Gaines is an investigative journalist who, in a previous work has examined the mansions and millionaires of the Hamptons, now focuses on the exclusive world of Manhattan co-ops.<br /><br />According to Gaines, the \\"good buildings\\" and the \\"best addresses\\" run along Fifth and Park Avenues.  One such good building is located at 820 Fifth Avenue.  Gaines tells us that everyone was shocked when the board of the co-op approved Tommy Hilfiger.  Its not that he didn't have the $100 million liquid assets needed to qualify, but the fact that he designed baggy gansta rap clothing.<br /><br />Gaines gossipy anecodotes are told mainly from the point of view of some of the carriage trade brokers that do the deals.  Many of the brokers are very hard-working and much more sensible than their clients.<br /><br />Dolly Lenz, for example, was the highest earning broker for Prudential out of a sales force of 58,000 nationwide.  Not only does she work in the rarified atmosphere of Manhattan co-ops, she also has the distinction of having sold the most expensive house in the New York.(Burnt Point in the Hamptons was sold to the CEO of Kinray for $45 million.)  Working seven days a week and the ability to thumb-type 80 words per minute on her Blackberrry, she still finds time to have dinner with, say, Bruce Willis or Barbara Streisand.<br /><br />Another good story, had to do with the San Remo building, possibly one of the most exclusive buildings in Manhattan.  Steven Jobs of Apple Computer bought the top two floors of the North Tower and spent five years and $15 million renovating it.  The other tenants were so frustrated by the renovation that they brought action limiting the amount of time renovations could take.  Jobs lost interest in the building and offered it to Bono of U2 for the cost of the renovation. Bono, smelling a bargain, snapped it up.<br /><br />Gaines is very good at analyzing the social distinctions between the different buildings and neighborhoods and the people who inhabit them. Although it may not add much to the sum total of human knowledge, it does entertain and give insight into the otherworldly ordeals of the super rich.it to Bono of U2 for the cost of the renovation.

US	28318021	RWPXBEOO34G63	0805073396	564190816	What's the Matter with Kansas? How Conservatives Won the Heart of America	Books	3	6	11	N	Y	The Great Backlash	In this book, journalist and founding editor of \\"The Baffler,\\" Thomas Frank examines why the people of his native state of Kansas are voting against their own economic interests.  The answer, he claims, has to do with the conservative backlash against the so-called social decadence and moral decay of cultural liberalism.  The Heartland is in open revolt against the cultural values being imposed upon them by the liberal elites.  The hot button issues that are being exploited by the conservatives include all the usual suspects: abortion, homosexuality, gun control, evolution, etc.  These stalking horse issues are, according to Frank, a diversion from their economic plight.<br /><br />But why are people voting against their economic interests?  Frank claims that at the moment the conservatives have the superior narrative.  In fact they have appropriated the language and the strategy of the left; they are now victims of some nefarious liberal elites.  Right-wing radio personalities such as Rush Limbaugh and Michael Savage, and conservative television newscasters such as Bill O'Reilly and Sean Hannity are telling us daily that the cultural values being imposed by Hollywood, the major networks, liberal universities and liberal judges are alien to average Americans.  The resentment of the right is being expressed through the hot button issues - voting issues.<br /><br />Then Frank correctly notes that once elected Republicans do very little about these issue other than speaking out for them in a symbolic way.  The real issues that the elected Republicans act on are the economic ones: cutting taxes, rolling back regulation, gutting environmental laws, and importing low cost non-union labor.  This in fact hurts the very people - the wing-nuts of the right - who helped put them in office. Frank wonders why they haven't figured this out.<br /><br />While conservative Republicans are the main object of his scorn, he also critcizes the Democrats - especially Clinton - for moving economic issues to the middle.  Frank wants to move them to the left, he wants to revive economic populism.  He talks about strengthening unions, raising class consciousness and so forth.  This, of course, is so retro - vulgar Marxist, some would say - and out of touch with reality that it goes a long way in explaining why the right currently has the better narrative.  In today's world of cross-border flows of goods, capital, and labor the left is going to have to do much better than pulling class struggle out of its hat.<br /><br />One Democratic Kansan who understands the current age of globalization is Governor Kathleen Sebelius who backed a $500 million tax incentive for Boeing to create more jobs in the Witchita area.  Frank critcized the move because it conceded too much.  The kind of leftist position that Frank is taking will only further deindustrialize Kansas.<br /><br />The people of Kansas probably resent being told by Frank - although born and raised in Kansas, currently a coast-dwelling liberal - that they do not understand their own interests.  As long as the Republicans have the narrative that speaks to the people of Kansas and the Heartland the great backlash will continue to be played out election after election.  Liberals and Democrats need to come up with a vision of the future that speaks to not only the economic but cultural concerns of the Heartland.moving economic issues to the middle.

The revised and more pessimistic message that we get from Clyde Prestowitz is that the playing field slightly favors the new capitalists.  Why?  They are willing to do the same work cheaper and better than their American counterparts.  American companies are having to choose between setting up shop on the new frontiers of capitalism or go out of business.  Prestowitz is a futurologist whose forecasts of the future have not always been realized ( remember \\"Trading Places,\\" predicting the dominance of Japan), but I think now he is much closer to the mark.  He thinks Americans have become to complacent about their economic superiority.  Instead of spending so much time and resources in trying to fix the rest of the world  it should start putting its own economic house in order.<br /><br />The problems that Prestowitz focuses on in this book are a contuation of the same problems dealt with in \\"Trading Places\\" with the rise of Japan.  The Asians - first the Japanese, and now the Tigers, China, and India - save, produce and export, and we still spend and consume.  People were worried in the 1980's when the trade deficit was $50 billion, last year it was $600 billion - $150 billion with China alone.  Clyde Prestowitz was concerned then, he is even more so now, and we should be too. Add this to a federal budget deficit of $400 billion, and one can conclude that we are living beyond our means to the tune of a trillion dollars a year.  The fact that the dollar is the world's reserve currency has thus far exempted us from acting responsibly.  And how are we financing these deficits?  The Bank of China and the Bank of Japan are buying t-bills and other financial instruments so that we have more ready cash to buy their products.<br /><br />The new capitalists produce and America consumes.  At present both sides are happy with this arrangement, but, Prestowitz warns that the day of reckoning is coming. This imbalance cannot be sustained indefinitely. The subtitle of this book is \\"The Great Shift of Wealth and Power to the East.\\"  The question that one wants to keep in mind when reading this book is where will America be when the wealth and power has shifted to the East?  Will it be impoverished or wealthy like the rest?<br /><br />Prestowitz has long been dismissed as a promoter of \\"industrial policy,\\" in which the government sets policies in place that pick \\"winners and losers.\\"  This is nonsense.  He is promoting a strategy that takes into account the \\"export led\\" economic strategies of our trading partners.  People in Washington are not keen on competitiveness strategy, instead they comfort themselves with the notion that the invisible hand deals economic justice in the marketplace.  However, our trading partners have strategies and, not surprisingly, they are strategies in which they are the winners and we are losers.  As we are playing our heroic role of the being the world's most ravenous consumer lifting billions out of poverty we should also keep our eye on mounting debts and our ability to pay them back.<br /><br />Prestowitz makes many useful recommendations in this book that are necessary but, politics being what they are, difficult to implement. For example, the tax system should be taxing consumption and not income.  This would increase our low savings rate.  Instead of consumption more money needs to be invested in education, infrastructure, and wealth-generating projects.  It is important that the economic ecosystem of top universities, high-tech infrastructure, venture capital, and manufacturing remains in this country in order to generate the \\"next big thing.\\"  If the ecosytem is weakened, our wealth generating capacity will be seriously impaired and the question of whether we will still be wealthy after the great shift will be answered.

The State Department - Talbot's employer - learned about the tests from CNN, and the CIA learned about them from the State Department. (The CIA used to know things.)  The foreign service officer in charge of the State Department's bureau of intelligence and research wryly remarked, \\" It looks like we're all having a bad government day.\\"<br /><br />Talbot was the Clinton's Administration's resident expert on Russian-affairs, but after the tests (Pakistan followed with nuclear tests two weeks later), he was immediately reassigned as the point person and crisis manager for South Asia.  His assignment was to persuade India to limit the development and deployment of their nuclear weapons; this included the signing of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT).  Talbot and his Indian counterpart Jaswant Singh met fourteen times over the last two and half years of the Clinton administration.  This extended dialog between Talbot and Singh ended with Talbot's failure to persuade India to accept any restraints on its nuclear weapons program - which came as no surprise to either Talbot or Singh.  The dialog -the engagement of India - brought many unintended benefits.<br /><br />Treaties such as the Non Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and the (CTBT) are, from an Indian perspective, discriminatory and condescending against everyone except the original five nuclear powers.  The nuclear option was seen by the Vajpayee Government, and especially by the right-leaning nationalists of the Bharatiya Janata Party, as not only a realistic defense policy, but also a tool for achieving great power status.  They never had any intention of signing the CTBT.  Talbot, for his part, was dealing with a weak hand because the Republican senators in the US were aslo unwilling to endorse the treaty.<br /><br />What became valuable was the engagement itself in that it altered the direction of US-Indian relations from one of mutual estrangement to one of trust and cooperation.  This was illustrated during the 1999 invasion by Pakistan of the Kargil area of Kashmir.  As President Clinton was holding talks with Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif of Pakistan to halt the invasion, he was at the same time consulting Vajpayee and seeking his advice.  This so impressed the Indian side that it paved the way for Clinton's historic visit in 2000.<br /><br />One of the fascinating things about this book is the personality of Jaswant Singh.  Singh hails from Rajasthan where his intimate experience with Islamic extremism pushed him toward's the BJP's staunch Hindu idealogy.  He had presciently warned Talbot that America did not fully appreciate the dangers of radical Islam. And regarding Pakistan, Singh was opposed to the very idea of Pakistan; the partition that took place more than fifty years ago had been a huge mistake.  He noted with characteristic flair that, \\"Kashmir should be understood as an objectification of Pakistan's predicament as a lost soul among nations, an ersatz country whose founders' only legacy was a permanent reminder of what a tragic mistake partition had been.\\"  In the end, Talbot's own views on Islamic extremism and Pakistan had come closer to Singh's.<br /><br />\\"Engaging India\\" is a fascinating account of the behind-the-scenes diplomacy that led to the improvement of US-Indian relations after fifty years of mistust.

In 1996, the Bharatiya Janata Party came to power and along with it came a new outlook on India's role in the world.  The old school were the Nehruvians  of the Congress Party (left-centrist), whose outlook was mainly anticolonial, socialist central planning and advocacy of third-world solidarity against Cold War blocs.  The new \\"center-right realist\\" school, represented by Jaswant Singh and KC Pant realized the world had changed after the fall of the Soviet Union.  The new world order was shaped by economics, and from economic strength comes military power.  The new government knew that it had to open its economy to international competition in order to achieve the growth rates needed to lift their population out of poverty.  No small task since about half of the world's poor are in India.  They found China's example encouraging.<br /><br />The BJP opened up their foreign policy establishment to input by outsiders such as journalists, academics, and even military personnel.  The old Congress Party was always very secretive about their decision making process for fear of a military coup.  It was also amazing that the BJP was tolerant of alternative views since some of its coalition partners were so intolerant - think of Shiv Sena, led by the notorious Bal Thackeray.  Today the BJP is no longer in power, the Congress Party is back in power, but it is no longer the same Congress Party - it too now is a believer in benefits of open markets.<br /><br />The liberalization of the economy naturally brought India and the US closer together.  America's support of Pakistan has always been a sore point in the relationship, but India now reluctantly accepts the fact that a stable Pakistan is in everyone's best interest, given the nuclear saber rattling that took place in 1998.<br /><br />The US is by far India's largest trading partner, and the impact that the two countries (the world's two largest democracies) have had on each other is profound.  Many of the high-tech startups in Silicon Valley have been created by Indian engineers and funded by Indian money.  The Indian-American community of 2 million is the single most affluent ethnic group in the US.  Many go back to India with their American experiences and recreate the successes. There are now more IT scientists and engineers in Bangalore than in Silicon Valley.<br /><br />Geostrategically, India will remain bogged down as a regional power as long as the problem of Kashmir festers, and by extension the problem of Pakistan.  According to Cohen, India must put this problem behind it before it can become a great power.  It is important for America to be evenhanded in its relations with both countries: for Pakistan is a frontline state in containing Islamic fundamentalism and India is a counterbalance China's growing military power.  It is also important that India sets the example of democratic success to counter China's authoritarianism.<br /><br />Cohen has written an excellent book that will be instructive not only to policymakers but to other readers as well.  One Indian reviewer has called the book refractive, as seen through the prism of American eyes; it is to our distinction that the eyes were so learned and perceptive.n benefits of open markets.

The correct answer or course is the former, and the Bush Administration has chosen the latter.  Brzezinski is one of the brightest geostrategic thinkers in the firmament, and he offers a very clear and systematic policy statement on which direction this country should be going to achieve national security.<br /><br />In the era of globalization, especially after 9/11, the link between national sovereignty and national security has been broken.  With the growing interdependence of nation-states, our national security is increasingly in the hands of others.  It is true, as President Bush claimed in the election campaign 2004 that we do not need permission from others to protect our security; it is also true that we need the cooperation of others in order to have security.<br /><br />On a couple of points Brzezinski is in agreement with President Bush.  The primary threat to international security comes from rogue or illiberal states - called the \\"Global Balkans\\" - that lie between the Suez Canal and the Khyber Pass, a part of the world that contains most of the world's oil and natural gas.  The region also contains some of the most religiously inflamed, politically turbulent, and ethnically conflicted people on earth.<br /><br />And to make matters even worse, they are festering with terrorist  and criminal groups searching for weapons of mass destruction.  It is in the interest of the civilized and energy hungry world to maintain stability.<br /><br />America is the preponderant but not omnipotent power.  America cannot stabilize the Global Balkans alone, nor with \\"coalitions of the willing.\\"  Brzezinski has a special place in his heart for Europe; he sees a healthy transatlantic alliance as the bedrock of global security.  Europe and America are natural allies through shared history and culture.  As a team our moral authority and political credibility would be greatly enhanced.<br /><br />Another point at which Brzezinski is in agreement with the Bush Administration is on the primacy of American military power.  Europeans and other allies understand, though they don't openly acknowledge, that global security is underwritten by American power.  Brzezinski differs with the administration on how this power should be used.  America may have the capablity of overthrowing rogue regimes in a few days or weeks, nevertheless, it still needs to build consensus in order to win a war.  If the excercise of military power is not done with legitimacy will fail and backfire.  Operations in Iraq (a good outcome is still possible) were executed in such a way that they spawned more terrorist groups, and even emboldened Iran and North Korea to press ahead with nuclear weapons development.<br /><br />It was even more important to build consensus in the invasion of Iraq because, as we know now, it was a preventative war ( a war of choice), not a preemptive war from some imminent threat.  The war in Iraq has given us greater insecurity, not only because it created new terrorists groups, but because our moral authority has been greatly undermined.<br /><br />The task that Brzezinski lays before the Bush Administration is  daunting given the events that have take place.  And the European Union, for its part, cannot even agree on a budget and or a constitution, let alone a coherent global security policy.  Nevertheless, American hegemony must be a consensual hegemony, not a domineering one.

He has not retired, however, from academic controversy.  In the politically correct discourse of today's universities it simply not fashionable to attribute economic success to cultural factors.  He doesn't hesitate to demolish along the way arguments of those who explain the West's success in terms of exploitation of the Third World, imperialism, colonialism, and racism.  These may have been symptoms of the West's success but not the causes.  The breadth of this work is staggering: he covers not only economics, but technology, religion, military history, cultural practices, politics, and geography.<br /><br />Some of the determinants of economic success are as follows:<br /><br />Geography.  The first chapter is called \\"Nature's Inequalities.\\" Landes points out that the environmental determinism of the past has given geography a bad name, but that recent scholarship has seen a revival of the determinant effects of geography, climate, and natural resources. ( Such as Jared Diamond's \\"Guns, Germs, and Steel\\".)  Extreme heat creates parasites, germs, and illnesses that have hampered countries located around the equator; whereas, Europe and North America has been favored by cold winters that kill dangerous pests and germs. We must not rule out geography as a determinant of economic success.<br /><br />Property Rights.  Along with Hernando DeSoto (\\"The Mystery of Capital\\"), Landes believes property rights started the engine of capitalism.  In Europe, in the late Middle Ages, peasants gradually gained property rights from the landed aristocracy, and were able to create and sustain businesses.  In Asia, the aristocratic rulers owned everything and were unwilling to relinquish control, and, thus, held back economic growth for centuries.<br /><br />Religion.  Christianity was a positive force for capitalism in that it separated church from state power, and, thereby, opened the door to pluralism.  Diversity of opinion was not tolerated in Asian and Islamic societies; only the rulers were allowed access to new knowledge and its uses.  Openess to new ideas and the ability to exploit them was one of the keys to European success.<br /><br />Science and Technology.  Certain key inventions and the  dissemination of these technologies throughout society was what  caused the Europeans to excel at the end of the Middle Ages and the beginning of the Modern Age.  The examples given by Landes are eyeglasses (enabling craftsmen to stay productive beyond age 40), the mechanical clock (widely used in Europe, but hoarded by rulers in Asian societies), printing (invented by Chinese, but widely used only in Europe), gunpowder (again, invented by the Chinese, fully exploited in Europe), the sextant (invented by the Arabs, but widely used by the Europeans), metal casting (allowed Europeans to produce superior weapons and subsequent military superiority), and the list goes on.<br /><br />Aside from geography, it is clear that culture played a large role in the economic success of Europe and, later, the United States.  It was about the relationship of the individual to the state or to their rulers that made the difference.  People who were free and guaranteed certain rights and liberties were the most successful.  The ones that were dominated and unquestioningly obedient to their rulers did not do so well.  The conclusions that Landes reaches are not unlike those of Adam Smith in \\"The Wealth of Nations.\\"  The wealth of a nation depends on private property, limited government, meritocratic advancement, hard work, rationalism, a healthy curiosity about other cultures, and an openess to new ideas.<br /><br />This should not be interpreted, as some reviewers have, that Western cultural practices are superior or enduring or the sole privilege of Europeans.  What was true for the last millenium may change in the new millenium.  Eastern Europe has cast off communism, China has retained communism in name only, and India has emerged from decades of Congress Party socialism.  There are today billion's of new entrepreneurs that have adopted the cultural practices of economic success.  The wealth and poverty of nations is not a permanent state of affairs, it is an ongoing work in progress.ge of Europeans.  What was true for the last millenium may change in the new millenium.

The fact that capital has the potential to produce \\"surplus value\\" is commonplace in the West but still a mystery to much of the develping world, and it is, according to Hernando DeSoto, the main reason they are still mired in poverty.<br /><br />DeSoto and his research team from the Institute for Liberty and Democracy in Lima, Peru have done some case studies of the legal barriers to economic growth in Egypt, Haiti, Mexico and the Phillipines.  What they have discovered is that the poor in these countries are actually in possession of assets to which they do not have legal title.  In Haiti 97% of the rural poor live in housing that \\"no one\\" owns, amounting to about $5 billion worth of \\"dead capital.\\"  In Egypt 92% of the urban dwellers do not have title to their property, worth about $240 billion.  In the Phillipines about 50% of the urban dwellers and about 66% of the rural people live in extralegal housing, worth about $133 billion.  Peru's extralegal real estate is valued at about $74 billion.  Worldwide the value of dead capital is about $93 trillion.<br /><br />Imagine $9.3 trillion converted into working capital for the poor.  This is the insight that makes DeSoto's work so compelling.  This is about 100 times the amount donated by wealtlhy countries to the developing world since the fall of Communism.  Desoto writes: \\"What the poor lack is easy access to property mechanisms that could legally fix the economic potential of their assests so that they could be used to produce, secure, and guarantee greater value in an expanded market.\\"  Converting informal or extralegal property systems into formal, legal systems is what lifted the West out of poverty in the 19th and 20th centuries; it can do the same for the developing countries today.<br /><br />Now also imagine the legal challenges in this great conversion of assets to capital.  All these parcels of land that are being illegally occupied are, presumably, owned by someone or will be claimed to be owned by someone if legal title is not clear.  Land reform in Europe and America took centuries of give and take to arrive at today's systems of property law.  The developing countries undergoing land reform should not expect \\"surplus value\\" anytime soon.<br /><br />Property rights are just one of the key ingredients of a robust market ecconomy.  There are other rights that are crucial to capitalism: such as, the right of contract, intellectual property rights, right to form corporations, and so on.  In other words, rule of law is necessary for the efficient functioning of capitalism.  If Desoto had expanded his analytical framework to include this bundle of rights - not just property rights - he would have done much better.it can do the same for the developing countries today. <br /> <br />Now also imagine the legal challenges in this great conversion of assets to capital.

Just as America's emergence as the preeminent economic power in the early 20th century China's ascent will have equally far-reaching consequences for businesses, employees, and consumers.<br /><br />Although there are many similarities between the rise of China and the US, there are also many differences.  America was a new nation and a democracy that became a beacon of freedom and free markets.  China, on the other hand, does have a relatively free market, but it's political system is anything but free and democratic.  Not many of the pundits would have thought that a relatively free market coupled with a political dictatorship could have an economy that grows at a rate of 9% annually.  Prior to Deng Xiao Ping's reform movement of 1978, China was isolationist and xenophobic, due to two centuries of colonial domination.  China did have the world's largest economy from around 1000 to 1700: this period was known as the Imperial Era.  Shenkar believes it is important to understand that China's current ascent to becoming the world's largest economy is seen by the Chinese as their rightful claim to a position they held previously for 700 years.<br /><br />The rise of China is also unlike that of Japan and South Korea.  One reason is size: China has a population of 1.3 billion.  It has been an investment magnet for foreign firms for the past 25 years.  Today China has replaced the US as the largest recipient of foreign investment in the world.  It's astonishing to some that foreign firms invest in China, given the level of piracy that takes place.  Yet companies like Microsoft and GM  will continue to do business in China inspite of the fact that software and car designs will continue to be stolen.  China will be the largest market and it is imperative for global companies to be there.<br /><br />The lure of the domestic market is a tremendous bargaining chip for China that was unavailable to Japan and South Korea.  It gives China the clout to demand technology transfers, or at least have foreign firms set up research and development centers where technology and designs can be easily pirated.  Authorities occasionally nab a counterfeiter or a bootlegger to appease the WTO, but on the whole they look the other way because they are saving on development costs.  How many Microsoft Office Suites were actually purchased? One in a thousand?<br /><br />China's ascent differs from that of Japan and South Korea in another respect.  As it moves up the technological ladder to higher-value-added production, it will not shed the labor-intensive jobs.  China needs 15 million new jobs a year just to keep pace with population growth and unemployment.  The current factory worker makes less than a dollar an hour, and with an endless supply of workers, wages will not increase very rapidly.  As a consequence, any global corporation that does not set up shop in China will have a difficult time surviving.  China also graduates more scientists and engineers that the US, or any other country, making high tech industries vulnerable as well.<br /><br />This is not to say that China is not facing so serious problems.  Modernizing an economy of 1.3 billion people requires tremendous amounts of energy and natural resources.  Anyone who follows the  commodities markets knows the effect that China has on the price of oil, lumber, iron ore and other natural resources.  This huge economic engine is consuming such large amounts of material that it has some of the most polluted cities in the world, and some of the worst environmental degradation on the planet.  Limited resources and increasing pollution will inevitably slow there current rate of growth.<br /><br />Nevertheless, Shenkar believes that the Chinese economy will soon reach a point where there will be some geo-political realignment that will have an impact as significant as America's at the beginning of the 20th century.  The rise of a new superpower will create challenges and it will create opportunities.  Any scenario that one may have of the future it will, no doubt, include a newly powerful China.

He sees our current civilization with all its modern technological comforts and luxuries based entirely on our access to cheap fossil fuels.  And in this alarming new book he offers a vision of what the world will look like as these cheap fossil fuels are depleted.<br /><br />Kunstler's thesis rests on two major assumptions:<br /><br />1)We are reaching a point known as the \\"global oil-production peak.\\"  What this means is that over half of the earth's oil endowment has already been consumed, and the remaining half, which will be more difficult to extract, will be much more costly.  The US reached peak oil production in the 1970's. (Remember the gasoline lines and the rise of OPEC.) And the global oil-production peak will be reached sometime between now and 2010.  Kunstler claims that oil company geologists are basically in agreement that the peak will occur sometime in this period.  So then it is not a question of if but when.<br /><br />There are dissenters, known as \\"cornucopians,\\" who dispute the claim that the oil supply is running out; for they believe that the earth will naturally replenish the world's oil fields.  These preposterous claims only bolster Kunstler's position.  However, there are more reasonable dissenters who fully believe new oil fields will continue to be discovered.  Wishful thinking.<br /><br />2)The second big assumption of this book is that Kunstler believes their are no viable alternatives on the horizon.  He goes through the entire list of alternative fuels - hydrogen, coal, hydroelectric power, solar and wind power, synthetic oil, biomass fuels - and demonstrates how each of these is an inadequate substitute for cheap oil.  His arguments are backed up by reams of facts and statistics, however, they are not very well documented. (There is no index and notes section in this book.)  He is absolutely convinced that no alternative energy source or technology will be developed that will maintain our current level of industrial civilization.  Apparently not everyone is convinced: Governor Swarzeneggar wants $54 million allocated for 100 hydrogen refueling stations in California. Also, a good book on this subject is \\"The Hydrogen Economy\\" by Jeremy Rifkin.<br /><br />Although it is reasonable to believe that the days of cheap oil are coming to an end, it is not reasonable to believe no alternatives will be discovered and developed.  Kunstler himself has been lulled into a little wishful thinking.  His hatred for car culture and suburbia are well known from his previous books. He seems almost gleeful when he describes the demise of subdivisions, strip malls and the likes of Wal-Mart and MacDonalds (with their 10,000 mile supply chains).  He foresees a world of small intimate communities, growing their own food and working close to home.<br /><br />Many will find that Kunstler's predictions border on science fiction, but they are a distant possibility.  This book should serve as yet another wake up call to the fact that the supply of fossil fuels is rapidly being depleted and that the remaining sources will be more costly to exploit.  As the price of oil continues to climb, governments and corporations will be pressured to find alternatives; if they fail to do so, we could see things much worse than Kunstler's idyllic farming communities.echnology will be developed that will maintain our current level of industrial civilization.

City planners today, according to Kotkin, do not take into account the sacredness of a place.  How can they?  Can you imagine a city planner calling for a more Christian city? or a more Islamic or Jewish city? or a more multiculural city?  In these secular times, the latter is about the only thing they can attempt.  But Kotkin considers multiculuralism a form of separatism. I say let the sacredness arise from the cultural ideas and pracitices of the citzens, not from the city planning office.<br /><br />That a city needs security and a vibrant business community seems a truism so true that I won't belabor the point here.<br /><br />The most interesting point made in the book concerns the impact of technology - especially telecommunications - on cities.  For the first time in history global megacities no longer have the advantage of size and scale.  With computers and telecommunications, businesses can now process and transmit information anywhere - the periphery of the urban centers, small towns, to places anywhere in the world.  Moreover, businesses can locate anywhere in the world - anywhere they have skilled workers.  The urban center is no longer necessary to operate a global business, in fact, it is no longer desirable.<br /><br />The growth of the urban periphery and small towns as corporate centers has been called the rise of the \\"telecity.\\"  Anyone who has followed real estate prices of areas 30 to 50 miles outside of urban centers over the last 20 years is well aware of this trend.  These areas are called \\"exurbs\\" and they are attractive to young people who want to start families and businesses.  They are characterized by spacious single story industrial and office parks rather than densely packed skyscrapers.  They are more affordable and more conducive to growth.  A more lively account of the exurbs can be found in David Brooks' \\"On Paradise Drive.\\"  The exurbs are hot.<br /><br />As corporations are moving their headquarters to the exurbs, megacities are looking for other sources of growth and revenue, and they are looking mainly at tourism and entertainment.  San Francisco, New York, Rome, Paris, and London now consider tourism, entertainment, and other cultural activities as their most promising industries.  Business and political leaders are promoting these cities as \\"cool.\\"  The goal is to attract artists, bohemians, and other hipsters in order to create new loft spaces, good restaurants, nightclubs, galleries, and museums.<br /><br />Kotkin is not optimistic about the long-term economic health of cool cities.  He calls them \\"ephemeral\\" cities, by pointing out that New York's Silicon Alley and San Francisco's Multimedia Gulch quickly died out after the dotcom boom of the 1990's.  He also belittles the lifestyles of urban hipsters and cosmopolitans.  These \\"empty-nesters\\" are nomads with no future prospects.  For example, it is estimated  that 10 percent of the population of Paris consists of modern-day urban nomads.<br /><br />Today's demographic trends favor the exurbs and the small towns not only in America, but also in Europe and Japan.  This is where young, skilled workers can afford to live and raise families.  However, as these hot, new, and growing population centers achieve a certain level of wealth, density, and complexity, they too will  become cool.s and businesses.

For example, it is estimated  that 10 percent of the population of Paris consists of modern-day urban nomads. <br /> <br />Today's demographic trends favor the exurbs and the small towns not only in America, but also in Europe and Japan.  This is where young, skilled workers can afford to live and raise families.  However, as these hot, new, and growing population centers achieve a certain level of wealth, density, and complexity, they too will  become cool.	2005-05-15

Extreme poverty is defined as living on less than a dollar a day.  About 1 billion people live on less than a dollar a day, one third of which are in sub-Saharan Africa.  This  book makes us aware of the extent of this tragedy and it offers a global plan to do something about it.<br /><br />The global plan, of course, requires big money and big debt relief.  Sachs has calculated that it would take anywhere from $135 billion to $190 billion per year of donations from rich countries  over the next two decades in order to eliminate extreme poverty by 2025.<br /><br />Not surprisingly, the conservative critics, such as the economist William Easterly, will disparage this plan as so much utopian social engineering and call instead for a more piecemeal approach (Neoconservatives, however, are different: they have a propensity for lavish spending and risky foreign adventures).<br /><br />Sachs' plan is not entirely new.  The development models of the 1960's and 70's were similar.  Huge amounts of money were allocated for building infrastructure and human capital; instead this money ended up in the bank accounts of dictators and corrupt aid officials.  The development focus of the 1980's and 90's was more toward ending corruption and state ownership, encouraging deficit spending and free trade.  The results have been equally disappointing: still 20,000 die daily.<br /><br />The Sachs' plan calls for some swift, aggressive, and large-scale \\"neoliberal\\" economic interventions.  His recommendations on how this $135 to $195 billion should be spent are staggering: it goes from how to plant trees, to soil fertility, to antiviral therapy for Aids, to mosquito nets for malaria, to specially programmed cell phones, to battery charging stations - just to name a few.  He proposes that the secretary general of the UN run the overall program (with the requisite oversights), and that this would lift poor countries out of the poverty trap by 2025.  This is, admittedly, a tough sell in conservative circles.<br /><br />It is disingenuous, however, for critics like Easterly and others in this column to call this plan utopian.  The goal of ending \\"extreme\\" poverty is getting countries to the first rung of the economic ladder so that they can participate in the gobal economy.  For example, Sachs considers sweatshop labor a step up from no labor at all - this is hardly a utopian goal.  Ending extreme poverty only prepares people and countries for the marketplace, it doesn't make them wealthy.<br /><br />It is true that an ambitious plan such as Sachs' would have its excesses and unforeseen consequences.  One of Sachs' problems is that he accuses people who disagree with him of being uninformed, or, worse yet, in the case of Africa, racist.  Surely, someone who became a tenured Harvard professor at aged 28 and saved a handful of countries from economic disaster is not lacking in ego.  He would do well to be a little more diplomatic.<br /><br />From this book one should remember the mission: to save 20,000 lives a day.  Instead of labeling proposals left-wing or right-wing, liberal or conservative, we should look deeply within our technocratic selves to end extreme poverty.just to name a few.

US	28318021	R1XSBFN4DK0WYH	0374292884	377846531	The World Is Flat: A Brief History of the Twenty-first Century	Books	4	18	22	N	Y	The Guru of Globalization	Thomas Friedman is at his enjoyable, engaging, and irritating best in this new book.  This work is a continuation and expansion of the 1999 work, \\"The Lexus and the Olive Tree,\\" in which he describes and praises the forces of globalization.  After the intervening years of focusing on the olive tree (terrorism and the politics of the Middle East), he once again turns his attention to the Lexus (technology and how it is interconnecting people and knowledge pools).<br /><br />This book has all the stylistic quirks that make reading Friedman so irritating.  The title, \\"The Earth is Flat,\\" is the new metaphor for globalization and interconnectedness.  Even though \\"flatness\\" is a dumbed down metaphor for a complex process that is transforming the world, this book should not be dismissed as  middle-of-the-intellectual-road equestrian excreta, as another reviewer has suggested.<br /><br />The metaphor of flatness is used to explain the current phase of globalization.  There has been a leveling of the playing field - sorry, another metaphor - in which countries such as China, India, and members of the former Soviet Union are entering the global economy.  This means that another 3 billion plus capitalists will be competing in the global marketplace.  Needless to say, this will have huge consequences for the industrialized countries of Europe, Japan, and the United States.<br /><br />The first part of this book describes ten forces that are flattening the world or, if you prefer, leveling the playing field.<br /><br />1)The Wall and Windows.  The fall of the Berlin Wall and the end of the Soviet Union and its support for autocratic regimes in the Middle East, Africa, and Latin America started the process of political liberalization.  It marked the opening of economies that were, hitherto, centrally planned.  Friedman also includes, in this time period, the advent of Windows as a universal operating system.  A falling wall and opening windows.<br /><br />2)Netscape.  The next flattener came when Netscape went public.  This commercial internet bowser made the internet accessible to everyone with a computer and a telephone.  The world logs on.<br /><br />3)Work Flow Platforms.  Work flow software has made it possible  for people anywhere in the world to communicate and collaborate in a seamless workplace.<br /><br />4)Open Source Platforms.  These are platforms established by self-organizing groups of programmers (like book reviewers for Amazon).  Friedman tells an amazing story of how IBM bases its Web server technology on such a shareware platform, known as Apache.  This shareware platform is completely outside of IBM's control.<br /><br />5)Outsourcing Y2K.  As Y2K approached many government and corporate officials were looking for a cost-effective way to avoid any computer glitches on Y2K.  Many of these officials turned to India for their software expertise.  This turned out to be so successful that most of the large IT companies have, since then, set up shop in Bangalore.  Friedman, with customary chutzpah, calls Y2k India's second Independence Day.<br /><br />6)Offshoring.  Here Friedman describes the well-known practice of shifting production offshore and integrating it into the global supply chain.  This process is better described in \\"China Inc\\" by Ted Fishman.<br /><br />7)Supply Chaining.  This is an excellent piece on Wal-Mart with its vast integrated supply chain and how it brings consumers the best goods at the lowest prices.  Wal-Mart has 6,000 suppliers, 5,000 of which are made in China.  They aren't joking when they say 80% of the products sold in Wal-Mart are made in China.  If Wal-Mart were a country it would be China's eighth biggest trading partner.  In short, Wal-Mart, because of its excellence in supply chaining, is one of the primary forces of global flattening.<br /><br />8)Insourcing.  Many companies and government agencies are turning to UPS to manage their supply chain, which UPS does better than almost anyone -except maybe Wal-Mart.  More than 60 global companies let UPS do all their shipping.  On a given day, UPS ships about 13.5 million packages - about 2% of the world's GDP.<br /><br />For Toshiba, UPS not only ships their computers, it also repairs them.<br /><br />9)In-Forming.  Search engines such as Google and Yahoo and websites such as Amazon are the individuals personal analog to open-sourcing, outsourcing, insourcing, supply-chaining and offshoring.  Its about building and deploying your own personal supply chain of information, knowledge, and entertainment.  Its self-directed and self-empowering.  Google alone is processing a billion searches a day, up from 150 million of three years ago.  This will increase exponetially when millions more gain computer access.<br /><br />10)Steroids.  In addition to browsers and search engines there has been a proliferation of digital technology devices that have been driving the flattening process.  Think of all the Ipods, Ipaqs, e-mails, file-sharings, digital photos, WiFi, and increased storage capacity.  The web of interconnectedness is being woven at a dizzying pace.<br /><br />So far so good. In the second half of the book, Friedman points out that not everyone will benefit from globalization.  Ricardo was right when he said that trade will benefit all countries.  However, not all individuals will benefit, some will be displaced and others will never have a chance to enter the marketplace.  Much of the world - Africa, parts of Latin America, Central Asia, and the Middle East - does not have access to a technological future - indeed, they are still mired in poverty and disease.  A good book on this subject is \\"The End of Poverty\\" by Jeffrey Sachs.  He outlines a plan for bringing these pockets of poverty into the economic mainstream.<br /><br />The industrialized world will also have to make major adjustments.  Jobs that are not anchored to location and that do not require specialized skills will be swept away in the coming  waves of globalization.  America still leads in science and technology, but the gap is closing quickly.  Its high time for Americans to do their homework, get upgraded, and find a niche in the flat world of the 21st century.er than almost anyone - except maybe Wal-Mart.

US	28318021	R3UGJTUN3DKCSN	037550804X	331061611	Mediterranean Winter: The Pleasures of History and Landscape in Tunisia, Sicily, Dalmatia, and Greece	Books	5	13	14	N	N	A Landscape Companion	Robert D Kaplan's latest book, \\"Mediterranean Winter: The Pleasures of History and Landscape in Tunisia, Sicily, Dalmatia, and Greece,\\" is written in the tradition of what was known in the 1930's as \\"landscape companions.\\"  The most well-known practitioners of this lost art were Robert Byron, David Talbot Rice, Lawrence Durrell, and Patrick Leigh Fermor.(They were all children of the British Empire.) This book recounts a journey Kaplan took shortly afer graduating from college in the mid 1970's.  Kaplan writes: \\"With this journey, I acquired the habit of searching books linked to landscapes and seascapes through which I traveled.  Reading became surgery; a way of dissecting the surrounding landscape and may own motivations for being there.\\"<br /><br />This is not the tourism of our present age, which is an escape from the drudgery of work; this is travel as work.  Every landscape, every ruin suggests a book or an author.  Every train trip or boat ride fills another notebook with observations and reflections.  Travel teaches us about history - the rise and fall of civilizations, the ebb and flow of empires.<br /><br />Kaplan's prose is on overdrive when travels through northern Tunisia.  He recalls on a bus trip: \\"...the sculpted, liver-hued steppe of northern Tunisia and the pinks of the southern deserts, with their vast blotches of salt; interior tablelands racked by lonely, bone-chilling winds and the grave, museum light of late afternoons; the smoking and hacking coughs of the other passengers wrapped like ghosts in their caftans in the pre-dawn darkness, drooping woolen sleeves concealing their hands; the comforting smell of tea, fresh bread, sharp cheese, and harissa at half-empty cafes where the bus stopped after sunrise, with their loud music, scabby walls, and bitter espresso served in whiskey glasses only a third full; the just-boiled eggs that would keep my hands warm in the bus, bought at a cafe or given to me by a friendly passenger with whom I might share may sunflower seeds.\\"<br /><br />Kaplan has said elsewhere that waited until middle age to write this book in order to avoid the purple prose of youth; however, there are some delightful moments of recidivism.<br /><br />In Tunisia, Kaplan uncovers the layers of history of this north African country, focusing mainly on the Carthaginian era and the subsequent conquest by Rome.  Rome is still everywhere present in the landscape of Tunisia, from the roads and aqueducts to the Colosseum at El Djem, and Kaplan illustrates this vividly.<br /><br />Also fascinating is his journey through Sicily.  In Sicily, he sees the legacy of the Crusades.  In the 1100's, two brothers from Normandy, Robert and Roger of Hauteville, conquered Moslem Sicily and created a modern multicultural state, in which Normans, Latins, Greeks, and Arabs could live together and prosper.  The historian John Julius Norwich describes this era in depth in \\"The Kingdom in the Sun.\\"<br /><br />Kaplan then travels to Tivoli, east of Rome, where he explores Hadrian's Villa. \\"Hadrian's Villa was the Versailles of the ancient world.\\"  This was the subject of Eleanor Clark's 1950 book, \\"Rome and a Villa.\\"  To his villa, Hadrian brought thousands of books, statues, and reconstructed landscapes to remind him of all the cherished moments of his past.  Kaplan compares him to Jefferson and his Monticello.<br /><br />After leaving Tivoli, Kaplan sails to Split on the Dalmatian coast.  Here he ponders the life and times of the emperor Diocletian, while walking through his palace: \\"If Hadrian was a romantic aesthete who encouraged the arts, Diocletian who ruled the Roman Empire 150 years after him, was a nuts-and-bolts pragmatist who spent most of his life in military camps.\\"  Diocletian was the first Roman emperor to rule the empire from the Balkans.  It was not long until Rome was sacked in 476 and the Balkans were annexed by Justinian to the Byzantine Empire.  After Byzantium, there were invasions by the Slavs andthe Turks.  Kaplan is very good when describing the mixture of people and civilizations that inhabit this part of the world; it was the subject of one of his previous books, \\"Balkan Ghosts.\\"<br /><br />The book ends with an entertaining visit to a spry 88-year-old Patrick Leigh Fermor, a fellow literary traveler and adventurer, living on the Peloponnesian Peninsula.  \\"The last pascha of the Mediterranean\\" was working on the third volume of his memoirs of a journey on foot from the Hook of Holland to what is now Istanbul.  We can only hope that Kaplan is still traveling and writing when he reaches this stage of life's journey.ture of people and civilizations that inhabit this part of the world; it was the subject of one of his previous books, \\"Balkan Ghosts.\\"    The book ends with an entertaining visit to a spry 88-year-old Patrick Leigh Fermor, a fellow literary traveler and adventurer, living on the Peloponnesian Peninsula.  \\"The last pascha of the Mediterranean\\" was working on the third volume of his memoirs of a journey on foot from the Hook of Holland to what is now Istanbul.

US	28318021	R3LYMY2JN4M6YP	0399151753	462275401	The Pentagon's New Map: War and Peace in the Twenty-First Century	Books	3	4	10	N	Y	The War on Disconnectedness	Since 9/11, scholars and strategic thinkers have been struggling to devise a new paradigm that would define our new security environment.  The bipolar structure of the Cold War has long ago fallen into irrelevance.  During the 1990's we were told of \\"the end of history\\" and \\"the clash of civilizations,\\" but neither explain the present.  The closest we come is the Bush administration's \\"war on terror,\\" however, the war on terror is not a national security strategy.<br /><br />Alas, from the research department of the Center for Naval Warfare Studies, US Naval War College, there has emerged a new paradigm.  Thomas Barnett, professor and senior strategic researcher has charted a comphrehensive plan, not only for fighting terrorism, but for extending global stability, human rights, and prosperity.<br /><br />Barnett's plan draws a direct link between globalization and terrorism.  He has redirected our attention to a geopolitical reality that has existed for a long time: namely, that there are countries that accept and thrive on globalization and there are those that are ruled by regimes that reject, either wholly or partially, globalization.  Reflecting this reality, Barnett neatly divides the world into two sectors: \\"the Functioning Core\\" and \\"the Non-Integrating Gap.\\"<br /><br />The Core initially consisted of North America, Europe, and Japan, but now also includes an emerging Core - Russia, India, China, Brazil, Chile, and Argentina.  The Core is characterized by network connectivity, financial flows, labor flows, media diversity, and all the political and economic freedoms of a liberal democracy.  The Gap includes parts of Latin America, most of Africa, the Middle East, Central Asia and - the most non-integrating member - North Korea.  The Gap is mired in disconnectedness.  Their condition is one of depravation, repression, ignorance, poverty, and malnutrition.  The ruling elites of the Gap countries retain their control by keeping globalization at bay. This, in turn, becomes an incubator for terrorists.<br /><br />Barnett proposes in \\"The Pentagon's New Map\\" that the new agenda for the military is to close the Gap, make everyone part of the Core, get everyone connected.  The new military must play two roles.  First, it must be a powerful, speedy, and deadly force ready to change regimes or quell civil wars anywhere in the Gap.  Secondly, it must have a robust civil affairs corp, capable of administering countries where the government has collapsed - a police-oriented force that deals mainly with civilians.  Barnett essentially wants to put the Pentagon in the security export business.  Only problem is, the customer wont't be buying and the other Core states will be terrified.<br /><br />Barnett was highly critical of the Bush administration's handling of the invasion of Iraq, not only for acting unilaterally, but for using fearmongering rhetoric.  I am no fan of the Bush administration, but they did make a fairly sustained effort to make the coalition as multilateral as possible.  There was absolutely nothing we could have done to get France, Germany, or Russia to join the effort.  The fearmongering rhetoric was merely part of the swagger and bluster that precedes the full-scale military decapitation of a hated regime.  Barnett's critcism of what happened after the invasion is on point.  This is where his touted \\"System Administrator\\" was sorely needed.<br /><br />To a large extent, the Bush administration was working on a theory similar to Barnett's: eliminate the Gap states in Central Asia and the Middle East, get them connected to the Functioning Core, and bring them political and economic liberties.  It is not only an intrinsic good, it was also a way of eliminating terrorism.<br /><br />As compelling as Barnett's map may be to senior Pentagon officials, the other Core states will not go along with this game plan, and without their endorsement there will be no more invasions as seen in Afghanistan and Iraq - at least notin the near future.  We no longer have the political support, nor the financial capablities, nor the manpower to undertake the project described in this book without the backing of the major powers or the United Nations.<br /><br />Let us take as an example North Korea, the most prominent denizen of the Non-Integrating Gap.  Assuming we wanted a regime change in order to bring 22 million people into the Functioning Core, we would need the active participation and support of China, Japan, Russia, and South Korea.  Is this going to happen?  Not likely.  Only if North Korea were threatening us directly with weapons of mass destruction, then we should act unilaterally.  We would need neither the other countries approval nor \\"The Pentagon's New Map.\\"at least not in the near future.

The Japanese business model, at the time, was very successful and feared by many as superior to our own.  Since then, we've had the longest economic expansion in our history and Japan has had the longest recession since the end of World War II.  Should we feel complacent?  Definitely not.  The economic juggernaut that is emerging in China is different and it will be more difficult to compete against. Our present government policies and our patterns of consumption are feeding the beast.  We are a primary component of China Inc.<br /><br />Ted C. Fishman is a veteran journalist and former commodities trader who has traveled widely in China and interviewed many workers, managers, and exucutives of Chinese and American companies.  He gives us an avalanche of facts detailing the incredible growth that the Chinese economy has experienced in the last 20 years (averaging about 10% annually as opposed to our meager 3%).  Can this growth rate be sustained.  Fishman doesn't have the answer but he gives us a multitude of statistics to draw our own conclusions.<br /><br />There is, in retail and manufacturing circles, something known as  \\"the China price.\\"  Goods manufactured in China cost anywhere from 30% to 50% less than what they could possibly be made for in the US, in many cases it is less than the cost of materials.  American multinationals - such as GM and Wal-Mart - are telling their suppliers to meet the China price or else - which means that the suppliers either set up shop in China or go out of business.  Never mind trying to compete on price, China has an abundance of production workers that are willing to work for 40 cents an hour.  Even at the high end they have chip designers that are willing the work for $2,000 a month, overtime included.  The supply of labor is almost endless, keeping wages at a minimum.  Anywhere from 100 to 300 million people migrated from farms to factories in the last two decades.  China also graduates more scientists and engineers than the US, making the high-tech industries increasingly more competitive.  And among the scientists and engineers that graduate from Americian universities one will find a large percentage are Chinese that will go back to China to work, even at a lower salary.<br /><br />By meeting the China price multinationals are accelerating the industrialization of China by moving production there and, by the same token, they are deindustrializing here.  It has been a major factor in the 2.7 million jobs lost in manufacturing since 2000. Even many small and medium size companies have no choice: move to China or go out of business.<br /><br />Multinationals alone are not to blame, the American consumer has a seemingly endless appetite for low-cost goods.  Low-cost Chinese goods have saved the American consumer more money than last year's tax cuts.  What this leads to is a gigantic trade deficit with China of about 150 billion a year - and climbing (the US balance-of-payments deficit is nearly a record 6% of GDP).  Add this to the record federal budget deficit and it should come as no surprise that the value of the dollar is in decline.  If this situation is not rectified the global financial system will be in for a shock.<br /><br />The Chinese are benefiting from our relationship in the short and the long term, the US is benefiting in the short term because they are receiving low-cost goods, however the long term outlook for the US is grim.  Not only do the Chinese buy up many of the T-bills that finance our federal budget deficits, they buy up mortgages on the secondary market in order to keep us supplied with low-cost money.  They are, in effect, lending us money to buy their products.  The burgeoning trade and federal budget deficits are a serious problem.  It is, however, not a Chinese problem, it's an American problem.  The only legitimate complaint that we can make is that they keep the yuan tied to the dollar.  No matter how low the dollar goes it won't help close the trade deficit with China.<br /><br />Fishman has an excellent chapter called \\"Pirate Nation.\\"  He describes how setting up production in China is a double-edged sword for American companies.  Everyone knows that these products are studied, analyzed, and reproduced perhaps with a few minor differences for local color.  For example, GM spent billions of dollars producing a car for the local market.  It was exhibited at the Shanghai Auto Show with a sticker price of $9,000.  At the same show a Chinese auto company had basically the same car - called the Chery - for only $6,000.  The Chinese auto company was owned in part by Shanghai Auto, GM's local joint-venture partner.  Similarly, Microsoft is well aware of the fact that only about 10% of its software is actually purchased and the other 90% is pirated; they have no choice but to stay in the Chinese market.  Indeed, at the World Economic Forum, Bill Gates seemed more optimistic about the Chinese economy than the American economy.<br /><br />China contiues to develop at a frantic pace.  They add 4 to 6 million cell phone subscribers every month - over a year they would be adding as many as the entire cell phone market of Germany.  The Chinese are adding infrastructure every month that is the equivalent of a Houston, Texas.  They are in fact lifting more people out of poverty than any country in the history of the world. We can all applaud their achievements.<br /><br />While I was reading this book, I kept thinking this is good news for China, bad news for the US.  This book should be read by those who are concerned about America's place in the 21st century, because it might well be known as the Chinese Century.

He was allowed to publish this book in 2004 on condition that he not reveal his name.  Since then, he has come in from the cold, retired and is currently on book tour.  I had the opportunity to here him talk about his book at the World Affairs Council in San Francisco.<br /><br />The central question of this book - like all books dealing with the events of 9/11 - is: \\"Why do they hate us?\\"  The answer, according to Scheuer, is not for what we are, but for what we do.  Scheuer, who has studied Bin Laden, the Middle East, and Central Asia for many years, believes Bin Laden is a rational actor with clear, focused, and limited policy goals, not an evil, apocalyptic terrorist as our leaders and pundits would have us believe.  Scheuer seems to know Bin Laden so well that he sometimes speaks of him in reverential tones - critics would go as far as calling him a fellow traveler.  He sees Bin Laden as  a charismatic leader of a world-wide insurgency of 1.3 billion  Muslims, who want nothing more than to rid Muslim lands of the \\"Crusader-Zionist alliance.\\"  Bin Laden's goals are as follows: \\"...the end of US aide to Isreal and the ultimate elimination of that state; the removal of the US and Western forces from the Arabian peninsula; the removal of US and Western military forces from Iraq, Afghanistan, and other Muslim lands; the end of US support for oppression of Muslims by Russia, China, and India; the end of US protection of repressive, apostate Muslim regimes in Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Egypt, Jordan, et cetera, and the conservation of the Muslim world's energy resources and their sale at a higher price.\\"<br /><br />These policy goals, however, are anything but clear, focused, and limited.  Not only is Scheuer confused but Bin Laden may be confused as well.  Scheuer claims that Bin Laden anticipated the backlash of the bombings of the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, that he expected the US and Western forces to invade Afghanistan.  It was part of his master plan to get the Muslim world to rise up against the West.  In order to do what?  To get the West out of Muslim lands?  It seems that Bin Laden's plan may be backfiring.<br /><br />Scheuer also claims that the invasion of Iraq was a gift to Bin Laden and the Muslim insurgency, in that it was a boon to the recruitment of more militants.  This may have seemed true at the time of the writing of this book, but since then, Western ideas of liberty and democracy have been infiltrating, not only Iraq, but Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and Lebanon.  Bin Laden unwittingly facilitated the Westernization that he was trying to root out.<br /><br />Scheuer does not subscribe to the failed civilization theory of historians such as Bernard Lewis.  He believes Muslims are not adaptable to democracy, civil rights, and pluralism.  In fact, he believes the Taliban will retake power in Kabul and that Afghanistan will return to the Islamic society envisioned by Mullah Omar, and that things will be as they have always been.<br /><br />Scheuer talks about the 1.3 billion Muslims as if they all had one voice and they are all sympathetic to Bin Laden's cause.  Nothing is further from the truth.  Witness Iraq: ethnicity trumps religion everytime.  The terrorism that is occurring in Iraq is about Sunnis against Shiites and Kurds.  Muslims in Iraq are fighting their own war against terror, not some insurgency with a noble cause.  Palestinians and Lebanese are fighting extremists within their ranks as well.  The events of the recent past clearly contradict Scheuer's assertions.<br /><br />It is not only a question of whether the West is winning the war on terror, it is whether the forces of moderation in the Muslim world are winning against the terrorists in their midst.  The West must partner with the forces of moderation in order to prevail, and recently there have been some hopeful signs.  The so-called careful police actions that Scheuer disdains are exactly right and the bloody military campaigns that he advocates are exactly wrong.  It requires more thoughtful engagement rather than the retribution and withdrawal that he recommends.<br /><br />It's a good thing Scheuer is not a policymaker, the kind of conclusions that we can draw from his analysis would only lead to another victory for Osama Bin Laden.d recently there have been some hopeful signs.

In the European Dream, he once again charts our decline: this time it's the American dream - it's dying a slow death.  In contrast, the European dream is the vision of the future.  The arguments Rifkin puts forth are very powerful, but he overstates his case.<br /><br />In the first half of this book, he takes us through the entire history of the modern age.  He's trying too hard to be profound.  He touches on everything from the origin of modern capitalism, the creation of the modern state, the rise of the bourgeoisie, differing conceptions of space and time, the \\"Great Chain of Being\\", and European and American views of religion.  What all the historical and philosophical background boils down to is that, whereas Americans are more indivdualistic and religious, the Europeans are more secular and community oriented.  He describes it as follows: \\"The European dream emphasizes community relationships over individual autonomy, cultural diversity over assimilation, quality of life over accumulation of wealth, sustainable development over unlimited material growth, deep play over unrelenting toil, universal human rights and rights of nature over property rights, and global cooperation over the unilateral excercise of power.\\"<br /><br />Cultural diversity over assimilation?  Europe has been so staunchly secular that the headscarf of Muslim women - or any outward display of religious affiliation - is not allowed in public schools.  Americans, on the other hand, are more comfortable with religious symbols, being religious folk themselves.  Moreover, it is reductionist to say that Europe is multicultural and America is assimilationist.  In reality they both have pockets of unassimilated immigrants - Muslims in Europe, Latinos in the US.  Multiculturalism creates pockets of otherness that are outside the mainstream.<br /><br />Deep play over unrelenting toil?  Yes, Europeans have an average of six weeks paid vacation annually, while the Americans have only two.  Europeans have better healthcare service - no one is uninsured.  American spend more per capita on healthcare, yet 40 million are without health insurance.  European schoolchildren outperform their American counterparts in math, science, and literacy; while Americans spend more per capita on education.  It can be argued that the quality of life is better in Europe.  They have always been better at distributing social goods and providing for leisure time.  The welfare state is a source of pride, rather than derision.<br /><br />The second half of this book goes under the heading \\"The Coming of the Global Era.\\"  Once you look past some of the business school buzzwords, you start see what is happening in Europe, or what has been happening over the last half century.  They are forging an ever closer union that is being negotiated on a continental scale, and it is a work still in progress.  Rifkin describes the novelty of the European Union as a governing institution.  It is a transnational government whose laws supersede those of its 25 nations.  It has its own parliment, its own court of law, its own passport, its own foreign policy, and its own military.  It regulates trade, energy, communications, transportation, and education across national borders.  It does not levy taxes, but it has an annual budget that is funded by member nations.  The European Union does not control territory in the traditional sense of a nation state - it is an extraterritorial governing institution.  Who will join next? Turkey? Ukraine?<br /><br />Critics will say that they are duplicating government, bureaucracy, and regulatory power.  True.  The interesting thing, however, about the European model is that it may be the next stage of globalizaton, the stage beyond the nation state.  Globaliztion of trade and finance has been around for hundreds of years.  The new European model is about the disappearance of boundries - geographical, linguistic, physical - in an ever shrinking world.  A few hundred years ago it was questioned whether Europeans from fiefdoms and principalities could feel loyalty to a nation state.  Not in the beginning, but eventually they became ardent nationalists with their ensuing tragedies.  Now they are asking themselves whether they can pledge allegiance to a transnational entity such as the European Union.  Two-thirds say yes.  Only time will tell.globalizaton, the stage beyond the nation state.  Globaliztion of trade and finance has been around for hundreds of years.

The Europeans, since they beg to differ, prefer to be called the European Union.<br /><br />What is the European Union?  The members themselves cannot agree. The French and the Germans think it is a federation of states.  The British and the Swedes(neither has adopted the Euro) see it as a loose confederation of nations.  In any case, it is more than an international organization and more than a trading bloc.  It consists of 25 nations, 455 million people and a combined GDP of $11 trillion; it \\"has more people, more wealth, and more trade than the United States of America.\\"  The European Union has its own parliment, governing council, central bank, and court of justice.  It has a constitution that is 265 pages long and a legal code that is over 80,000 pages.  It has a national anthem (Beethoven's Ode to Joy) and it has its own feast day (May 9).  It has more votes than the US in most international forums and it can influence nations with economic largesse, which it has, rather than military force, which it lacks.  Remember the run up to the war with Iraq?<br /><br />What was the driving force behind the creation of this superpower?  Lately, the European Union has emerged as a \\"counterweight\\" to the US, moderating our unilateralist tendencies.  However, at their inception, they were trying to emulate the United States economically, creating a large single market with a single currency and uniform commercial codes.  Gradually, they also became interdependent politically and institutionally.  Reid would also argue that they are becoming interdependent culturally with his chapter on Generation E, but pop culture does not a culture make.  The deepest motivation for forming the European Union was what it was designed avoid: namely, the tragedies of the first half of the 20th century.  Now they have pooled their sovereignty in the pursuit of perpetual peace and a common prosperity.<br /><br />Reid emphasizes mainly the achievements of the EU while only passing over its failings - its failings will be trumpeted by the Americans.  He rightly points out that Western European nations have lower infant mortality and higher life expectancy than the US.  Despite the fact that the US spends more per capita on healthcare, it ranks 37th amoung nations in quality of healthcare service.  Europeans have universal healthcare, not to mention childcare and parental leave (sometimes up to a year with 100% of salary) - to mention a few.  The numbers on education are similar.  The US spends more per capita on education and has better endowed universities, yet Americans continue to underperform Europeans in math, science and language. Reid copiously illustrates how the EU is better at distributing public goods than we are.  We knew that, but its good to be reminded.<br /><br />Most American critics are quick to point out the shortcomings of this arrangement.  They will tell us that Europe has low levels of economic growth, high levels of unemployment, overregulation, a union-dominated labor force, a declining birthrate, and a preference - not surprising - for leisure over work.  The Europeans are well aware of these problems, but they have chosen to sacrifice economic growth for quality of life.  They feel that their soft power is better than our soft power.<br /><br />I tend to agree with the author that the creation of the European Union is a good thing; however, I would not say it is the end of American supremacy.  America has a major headstart in the superpower contest and has a huge capacity for renewal.  As Thomas Friedman would say, \\"two United States are better than one.\\"  In the future, I can see the two superpowers working in tandem - one big red state and one big blue state, if you will - moderating each others excesses, as well as setting the agenda for the rest of the world along the lines of our shared values.  Read this book for a new look at transatlantic relations and its possibilities.uture, I can see the two superpowers working in tandem - one big red state and one big blue state, if you will - moderating each others excesses, as well as setting the agenda for the rest of the world along the lines of our shared values.

In 1995, Chechen separatists placed a radioactive \\"dirty bomb\\" in a park in Moscow, but decided at the last minute not to detonate it.  In 1997, Russia reported that 84 of some 132 suitcase-size nuclear bombs were missing.  In 2002, Serbian police seized enough fissionable material from a laboratory in a Belgrade suburb to make at least three nuclear bombs.  These are just some of the incidents, occurring in the last decade, that should awaken the civlized world to the threat of nuclear terrorism.  Unfortunately, political leaders, here and abroad, will spend very little political capital on fighting a threat that is merely a theoretical possibility.  After 9/11 they - we - should know better.<br /><br />Graham Allison, founding dean of Harvard's John F. Kennedy School of Government, provides several possible and realistic scenarios in which a nuclear bomb could be smuggled into an American city and detonated, causing casultiies many times higher than those of 9/11.  Allison claims that, \\"Even an assembled device, like a suit-case nuclear weapon, could be sent in a Federal Express package, shipped in a cargo container, or checked as airline baggage.  Of the seven million cargo containers that arrive in US ports each year fewer than 5 percent are opened for inspection.\\"<br /><br />Once terrorists obtain a nuclear weapon it would be very difficult to prevent them from using it.  Where prevention is possible is in the terrorist's acquisition of fissionable material - highly enriched uranium (HEU) or plutonium.  These ingredients are expensive and difficult to manufacture.  The key to prevention is making it impossible for anyone, especially terrorists and rogue states, to acquire these materials.<br /><br />Allison spends the entire first half of the book convincing us of the inevitability of a terrorist nuclear attack, in order to alert us of the impending threat.  He spends the second half telling us that it is preventable, here to mobilize us against this threat.  His prevention policy consists of the \\"three no's.\\"<br /><br />1)No loose nukes.  This also includes no unaccounted for fissionable material.  Without fissionable material there can be no nukes.  The Nunn-Lugar Act of 1991 provided funding for securing fissionable material and unguarded nuclear weapons, mainly in the former Soviet Union which, at the end of the Cold War, was devolving into chaos and lawlessness.  Allison faults the Bush administration for not aggressively enforcing the Nunn-Lugar guidelines and not adequately funding its implementation.<br /><br />2)No new nascent nukes.  This policy is aimed at countries such as Iran, countries that are already building nuclear facilities, putatively for the peaceful production of electricity.  Allison proposes that countries already producing enriched uranium sell it to those who need electricity and buy back the spent fuel.  This is what the Europeans are offering the Iranians at the present.  The Iranians, however, are balking.  This is a tough sell, and even if the Iranians were to buy it, they could change their facilities to weapons-grade production fairly easily.  It is a question of the major powers, acting in solidarity, making it very unattractive for them to do so.<br /><br />3)No new nuclear states.  The nuclear club presently has eight members.  We do not want Iran in the club and we definitely do not want North Korea.  The Bush administration has lost precious time trying to formulate a policy towards North Korea.  While they were sure Saddam possessed weapons of mass destruction, they show skepticism towards North Korea, even today, when the North Koreans themselves are claiming to have nuclear weapons.  The only realistic option, which Allison doesn't mention, is persuading China to put pressure on North Korea to give up its nuclear ambitions.  China provides North Korea with most of its food and fuel, and is, therefore, the only country with real leverage - not to mention the fact that they are communist cousins.  To think that North Korea could be denuclearized militarily is hopefully beyond the wildest dreams of the Pentagon.<br /><br />Allison praises the Bush administration for recognizing the toxic mix of terrorism and weapons of mass destruction, but criticizes them for lacking a comprehensive strategy for halting the spread of nuclear weapons technology.  This excellent book offers a blueprint for such a strategy.  It is a book that everyone should read.

After 9/11, with the world economy contracting, the pendulum tilted the other way, and it became the source of everyone's misery.<br /><br />Now cooler heads are prevailing with calls for a more managed globalization.  Colombia economics professor Jagdish Bhagwati has produced a well-written and well-argued book to meet the critcs head-on, calling for a more nuanced, softer globalization.  He divides his critics into two categories.  First, there is the hard-core anti-capitalist, anti-corporate crowd whose opinions are formed mainly by university departments of sociolgy, cultural studies, and comparative literature.  These are trendy intellectuals who partake in high-altitude thinking with little regard for the realities on the ground (except when they are rioting at trade conferences).  They are so out of touch with reality that Bhagwati chooses not to waste any time on them.  Secondly, there are critics who generaly agree with the idea of globalization, but are concerned the social problems that accompany it; this is the group that Bhagwati addresses in this volume.  A long-time trade economist, he is himself sympathetic to the social goals of the second group.  The book tackles each problem on a chapter by chapter basis.<br /><br />1)Poverty is diminished.  Evidence: India, for three decades as a closed economy had a growth rate of 4 percent and a poverty rate around 55 percent.  After opening to foreign trade and investment, growth averaged 5 percent and poverty dropped to 26 percent.  China fared even better.  After opening their economy, growth has been close to 9 percent annually and poverty has fallen from 28 percent to 9 percent.  Bhagwati's motto is openess brings growth, which reduces poverty.<br /><br />2)Child labor is reduced.  His favorite example here is Vietnam.  With more access to global markets, workers salaries increased, making it possible for them to take their children out of the workplace and to send them to school.<br /><br />3)Gender discrimination is reduced.  He argues that women are empowered by the fact that they can travel abroad, find work and send money home to support their families.  This is controversial but there is some truth in it.<br /><br />4)Promotes democracy.  There is discussion of China's entry into the World Trade Organization.  Global trade will create a middle class - already has - who will eventually demand democratic values.  The rise of democracy is inevitable.  This argument is compelling, while there are still many detractors.<br /><br />5)Culture is enriched.  There have been many diatribes against the spread of American low culture, symbolized by junk food and tawdry entertainment.  Bhagwati is sympathetic to their plight.  However, he also points out that, \\" the United States is at the cutting edge of women's rights, children's rights and much else that more traditional, at times feudal or oligarchic regimes elsewhere find threatening to their cultural and social order.\\"<br /><br />6)Wages and labor standards are improved.  Here he urges that one must measure wages and labor standards against similar environments that have not been opened up to the forces of global trade, rather than compare against Western standards.  One will find that globalization proves beneficial.<br /><br />7)Globalization does not neccessarily harm the environment.  He concedes that free trade must be combined with environmental policy.  Though he is vague on the role of government in the economy, he does call for an active role for NGOs in environmental protection.  With the right policy, corporations can actually help reduce pollution in developing countries.<br /><br />8)Corporations are beneficial.  Bhagwati lists a host of good effects that multinationals leave in their wake, as describedin 1 throught 7.  In addition, they bring modern technology and better management practices to developing countries.  It is the only way poor countries can lift their way out of poverty. International organizations have not been as successful.<br /><br />In the last part of the book, Bhagwati makes some policy recommendations - unemployment insurance, retraining programs, measures to mitigate the volatility of agriculture, etc - to soften the impact of globalization.  Inspite of the tremendous positive force of globalization, he does recognize that things can go very wrong.  Nevertheless, his arguments are convincing and the alternatives are not an option.wake, as described in 1 throught 7.

This is the book that all members of Congress should read before the upcoming debate on Social Security reform.  Since he co-founded the Concord Coalition in 1992 - a bipartisan coalition calling for fiscal responsibility in Washington - Pete Peterson has written a number of books on the coming demographic changes and their impact on entitlement programs.  According to Peterson, the Democrats and Republicans \\"have launched America into the new century on a course of vast and mounting budget deficits, which, if left unaltered, can only end in an economy-shattering crisis or crushing burdens on America's younger generations - or both.\\"  Many will call him a Cassandra, but with 70 million baby boomers retiring starting 2008 Social Security and Medicare will be seriously straining under trillions of dollars of red ink.<br /><br />Pete Peterson, former Secretary of Commerce and former chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank in New York, is a lifelong Republican who embraces a fiscal conservatism that dates back to pre-suppply-side Republican orthodoxy.  In this book he tries to be evenhanded in distributing blame for our bleak financial future.  He accuses Democrats of turning \\"the federal government into a massive entitlements vending machine which operates by dispensing new benefits in the return for organized political support and by deferring costs as far as possible into the future.\\"  For the Republicans, he asserts, \\"the pursuit of lower taxes has evolved into a religion, indeed a theology that discards any objective evidence that violates the faith.\\"  In other words, Repblicans buy their constituents by giving them tax cuts and Democrats buy their constituents by giving them entitlement programs.<br /><br />Peterson has special scorn for the Bush Administration: they want to give their constituents both tax cuts and entitlement programs.  He calls them \\"big government conservatives\\" or \\"tax-cut and spend conservatives.\\"  They passed a $535 billion, 10-year Medicare prescription drug benefit package that may cost well over $2 trillion in its second 10-year period.  On top of that, the Bush Administration and the Republican Congress have been responsible for three consecutive tax cuts in the last four years.  One must always remember a tax cut is not a tax cut unless there is an equal reduction in expenditures.  Don't believe those who tell you we can \\"grow the economy\\" out of this mess.  Peterson writes, \\"This administration and the Republican Congress have presided over the biggest, most reckless deterioration of America's finances in history.\\"<br /><br />Being a Republican, Peterson has difficulty giving any credit to the Clinton Administration.  When President Bush entered office, there was a projected 10-year budget surplus of $5.6 trillion.  After four years in office, the 10-year projection is a negative $8 to $10 trillion - quite a reversal of fortune.  During the Clinton Administration moderate Democrats and Republicans were serious about deficit reduction under the president's leadership.  Both parties saw the wisdom of fiscal constraint until 1998.  When the budget began to show a surplus the political consensus disappeared partisanship once again ruled the day.<br /><br />The solutions that Peterson proposes are very interesting, whether they are politically feasible is another story.<br /><br />He offers the following:<br /><br />1)Index new benefits to prices, instead of wages.  The new benefits calculated each year for retirees would be adjusted upward by an increase in the consumer price index, rather than average wages.  There would be big savings here since wages rise faster than prices.<br /><br />2)Mandate savings in personal retirement accounts.  The key word here is mandatory.  Also these personal retirment accounts would be kept out of reach of Congress.<br /><br />3)Fortify Social Security's safety net.  This means having the federal government contribute into personal accounts on behalf of the low incomeworker.  This would help build an ownership stake in society just as the mortgage deduction does for the middle class.  Also \\"affluence-testing\\" of benefits so the wealthy recipients receive less than those who really need it. This is very controversial because there is more political support for giving benefits to the middle class than to the poor.<br /><br />This is were the debate on Social Security reform should be going.

To an extent this has proven to be the case.  In the present volume - \\"Who Are We: The Challenges to American Identity\\" - he predicts similar conflicts unfolding domestically inside America's borders.  The clash of civilizations within, as it were.<br /><br />And what is the American national identity that Huntington claims is being challenged?  He asserts that our national identity consists of two components: Anglo-Protestant culture and the American creed.  Anglo-Protestant core culture is uniquely American and it is the foundation upon which the more universal principles of the American creed are based.  He believes that the unique aspects of this identity are central to our national survival.<br /><br />Anglo-Protestant culture has been central to the American identity for three centuries.  It was originally established by dissident Protestants from England who valued individualism, had a healthy suspicion of government, had a vigorous work ethic, believed in voluntary associations and who had a crusading moralism tempered by tolerance.  They were united by the English language and English legal tradtions.  These were the salient features of the core culture upon which the creed rests.  America would have been very different had it been settled by French or Spanish Catholics.<br /><br />The American creed, the second component, consists of principles to which all can subscribe: liberty, equality, civil rights, nondiscrimination, justice, and rule of law - all the elements of a liberal democracy.  Huntington believes that even though the elements of the creed are universal their American manifestation are an outgrowth of our singular Anglo-Protestant core culture and not transferable everywhere.<br /><br />Huntington believes that this unique American national identity is being challenge at both ends of the social spectrum.<br /><br />At one end of the spectrum are the liberal elites who are becoming increasingly denationalized with their doctrines of multiculturalism and globalization.  \\"...American elite groups, business, financial, intellectual, professional and governmental were becoming denationalized and developing transnational and cosmopolitan identities superseding their national ones.\\"<br /><br />Obviously leaders of multinational corporations and international organizations must deemphasize their national identity when conducting their business.  Being a nationalist chauvanist on the world stage would be counterproductive and offensive.  Huntington's argument here is mainly against the mulitculturalism encourged by the elites.  The irony is that the cultural elites derive mainly from the Anglo-Protestant tradition.  Are the elites trying to make it a global culture?  Or are other cultures at the same time transforming Anglo-Protestantism?  I think both are the case and that Huntington may be on a fool's errand to get in the way of this two-way traffic.<br /><br />On the other end of the spectrum America's national identity is being challenged by immigration.  Huntington claims that the large influx of immigrants from Latin America - especially Mexico - is different from previous waves of immigration.  The Mexican immigration poses at threat not only for the numbers involved (23 million and counting), but the fact that they are concentrated in states and cities close to our mutual border.  With low rates of assimilation, bilingualism, and dual citizenships, Huntington believes they could make territorial claims in the future.<br /><br />Huntington, I think, misreads the Mexican immigrant for numerous reasons.  Primarily, Mexican immigrants want to \\"commit themselves\\" to \\"Anglo-Protestant culture\\" as defined by Huntington.  They are dedicated to the work ethic, they seek to learn English, they become members of the armed forces, and after the second and third generations they intermarry, go to college, and speak only English just like \\"ordinary Americans.\\"<br /><br />Their assimilation is actually very similar to that of the southern Italians and East European Jews of an earlier generation, only the scale is different.<br /><br />Huntington has written an important book that poses some serious questions about American national identity.  He is somewhat alarmist about the transformation of the Anglo-Protestant culture of yesteryear.  However, I believe American culture is always evolving and becoming more inclusive.  Multiculturalism and cosmpolitanism reaches out and  incorporates more diverse groups into the American identity, making it less dependent on race, ethnicity, and religion.  The important ingredient is creed; everyone must believe in the creed which is central to American identity.\\"Anglo-Protestant culture\\" as defined by Huntington.

Since World War II and up until the collapse of the Soviet Union there was a policy of containment and deterrence.  During the 1990s, in the wake of the collapse, there was a feeling that democracy and capitalism would eventually triumph everywhere; the Clinton administration reasoned that the US \\"only needed to engage and the rest of the world would enlarge the process.\\"<br /><br />In response the 9/11 attack the Bush administration formulated a new strategy, outlined in the national security speech at West Point on June 1, 2002.  This speech called for a new strategy which looked like a departure from American tradition.  The key elements of this new strategy were preemption, unilateralism, and hegemony.  In the beginning, it was little noticed; however, in the run-up to the invasion of Iraq, people began to examine this strategy more closely.<br /><br />Yale professor John Lewis Gaddis, in this short and well-written little book, argues that this was not a new policy, in fact it had deep roots in American history that go back to the earliest days of the republic.  Gaddis demonstrates that after the British attack on Washington DC during the War of 1812, the then secretary of state, John Quincy Adams asserted the same three principles.  Preemption was the rationale for Andrew Jackson's invasion of Florida, the \\"failed state\\" of its day being a haven for marauding Seminoles, runaway slaves and profiteering pirates.  With the diminishing authority of the Spanish in Latin America, the US sought to restrict the influence of other European powers in the Western Hemisphere.  The Monroe Doctrine was a unilateralist declaration even though the US did not have the means to enforce it without the backing of the British navy.  And in the end, the policy of John Quincy Adams was to be the predominant power in the Western Hemisphere, or at least on the North American continent - a hegemon in all but name.<br /><br />Preemption, unilateralism, and hegemony was indeed a US strategy up until World War II.  The US was seeking merely to assure its security by keeping the European powers out of the hemisphere.  Most Americans believed it was a mistake to seek an oversees empire as the brief foray into the Phillipines proved in the early part of the 20th century.<br /><br />After the attack on Pearl Harbor, Roosevelt was forced the build alliances with the Soviet Union and other great powers in order to defeat Germany and Japan.  It was thus necessary to forgo preemption and unilateralism in deference to the alliance.  During and after World War II, the US took the lead in building multilateralism institutions - a multilateral system that not only ensured American hegemony, but made it desirable at the same time.  Forgoing preemption gave the US the moral high ground, which it maintained until the invasion of Iraq.<br /><br />The Bush administration's invasion of Iraq had all the elements of a grand strategy: preemption, unilateralsim - when multilateralism failed - and American hegemony.  There was also an innovation to this strategy: there would be an active promotion of democracy in the Middle East.  This idea swayed many liberals to the cause, including members of the media and the academic community.<br /><br />The problems with this strategy became apparent after the invasion.  They are too numerous to go into and obvious to anyone following the news.  The mistakes made during the occupation leaves the Bush Doctine with only a few remaining supporters.  The failure to enlist the great powers, not to mention many of the smaller powers, destroyed our status as a benign hegemon and jepardizes our moral high ground.<br /><br />Gaddis does an excellent job of explaining the grand strategy and showing that it has precedents in history, better than Bush or anyone in his administration.  However, he doesnot show that this strategy is justified, morally or legally, and he does not seem to fully appreciate that many of our friends and allies find this strategy frightening and repugnant.  They do not call us arrogant for nothing.<br /><br />Nevertheless, the jury is still out.  Immediately after the invasion, it looked as though one regime after another would fall in the region, along the lines of the dominoes of Eastern Europe.  At the present writing, with the Iraqi elections approaching, a decent outcome seems remote and a civil war possible.  Yet, there are stirrings of hope and change elsewhere in the Middle East, such as in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.  The upheaval in Iraq is also creating debate that did not exist before in Egypt and the Gulf States.  The pendulum may again swing the other way and the grand strategy may be working inspite of itself.egally, and he does not seem to fully appreciate that many of our friends and allies find this strategy frightening and repugnant.

He marshals the disciplines of politics, economics, sociology, history and religion to produce a provocative and compelling analysis of America and its role in the world.<br /><br />This important book describes what Mead calls the \\"American Project...to protect our own domestic security while building a peaceful world order of peaceful states linked by common values and sharing a common prosperity.\\"  This project is rooted in American history and tradition.  (This work should be read in tandem with Surprise, Security, and the American Experience by John Lewis Gaddis.)<br /><br />Mead identifies four schools of thought that animate our way of thinking about foreign policy.  1)Wilsonians are idealistic internationalists who believe the spread of democracy abroad will give us security at home - many of the neoconservatives are of this persuasion.  Present-day Wilsonians are notable for their lack of confidence in international institutions.  2)Jeffersonians adhere to isolationism, even less of an option today than it was in the 19th century.  3)Hamiltonians are the business class that promote enterprise at home and abroad; they believe that globalization contributes to peace and security.  4)Jacksonians are described as \\"populist nationalists.\\"  They have the individualist's suspicion of government.  And, oh yeah, they like to fight.  In foreign policy that translates into overwhelming force and total victory.<br /><br />The Bush administration's war on terror has been, according to Mead, a combination of Revival Wilsonianism and Jacksonianism.  The internal conflict between these two approaches are never more obvious than in the present occupation of Iraq.  While the Wilsonians are delicately trying to plant the seeds of democracy, the Jacksonians want victory over the evildoers regardless of the consequences.<br /><br />Another trend that Mead describes is the shift from managed capitalism (\\"Fordism\\") which is a cooperative arrangement among the managers of state, business, and labor to a global capitalism (\\"millenial capitalism\\") which is less regulated and less equitable in its distribution of winners and losers.  The Hamiltonians are promoters of millenial capitalism.  It is a worldwide phenomenon that the state elites dislike because it diminishes their control over the economy.  One more reason they hate us.  The poor also liked the old system because it brought government subsidies.  Alas, they too hate us.<br /><br />Mead's prescription for helping the poor is of course in tune with millenial capitalism.  The money for old style foreign aid is no longer there since Western governments are all running huge deficits already.  He advocates private banks lending money in the form of microloans.  This has been done succussfully in Bangladesh and elsewhere.  (Read Banker to the Poor:Micro-Lending and the Battle Against World Poverty by Muhammad Yunus.)  Outreach to the poor is not only a good in and of itself but it also provides fewer soldiers for international terrorism.<br /><br />The Revival Wilsonianism of the Bush administration also has a religious element.  Mead believes that the religious aspect of the foreign policy agenda should be embraced by us and the rest of the world as a basis for action since international institutions are not providing us with the proper values necessary to guarantee our security.  This is where I part company with Mead.  Even though international institutions have failed on many occassions, I still have more confidence in the United Nations than evangelicals in charge of foreign policy.  We must guard against becoming like the enemy; trying to fight Islamic fanaticism or fascism with evangelical Christianity is not the proper course.  The proper solution would be reforming existing international institutions to reflect new realities.  Long live the separation of church and international governance.<br /><br />This book is very good at identifying the domestic sources of our search for solutions to our international problems.  The goal of this book was to offer important discussion on securing America domestically within a network of states that share our values and it achieves that goal reasonably well.ions to reflect new realities.

Historian Niall Ferguson has an innovative - but retro - solutiion, a solution that would not sit well with most readers. He argues that the world needs an empire. Not just any kind of empire, a liberal empire. A liberal empire would provide the dysfunctional states of the world with the international public goods that they would otherwise lack or would otherwise be unable to obtain. The liberal empire that he has in mind is of course the American empire. But wait, America is not an empire.<br /><br />Americans, or most of them, would cringe at the thought of being called an empire. Foreigners would be even more alarmed if the American government self-consciously described itself as an imperial power. To the contrary, Ferguson says that given America's enormous military, economic, and cultural power it is the most powerful empire the world has ever known, not only that, it should acknowledge and embrace it.  America currently has over 750 military installations in more than 130 countries.  The upside of a liberal empire is that it can provide peace and stability, rule of law, stable fiscal and monetary policies, infrastructure, and the free exchange of commodities, labor, and capital.  And the downside?  Ferguson does not go deeply into the downside, but former colonies and dominions of previous empires will remind us of the racism, violence, and exploitation that is part of the legacy of empire.<br /><br />In his call for empire, Ferguson concedes that America may not be up to the task, but he urges us to change our ways.  Aside from a few successes at nation-building - notably Japan and Germany after World War II - America has had some disastrous overseas interventions.  America, as an empire, is burdened by three deficits: an economic deficit, an manpower deficit, and an attention deficit.  The economic deficit is that Americans would rather see their tax dollars going towards Social Security and Medicare than towards nations that do not welcome their presence.  The manpower deficit refers to not only our overstretched volunteer military, but our lack of civil service personnel necessary to run an empire.  The third deficit is our national attention deficit disorder.  After spectacular military victories in Iraq and Afghanistan there is already talk of quagmire and exit strategies.  America does not have the staying power to see through its military interventions.<br /><br />The main problem with Ferguson's thesis is that even though he can demonstrate that a liberal American empire would be a net good for all parties involved, the beneficiary country would still be unconvinced.  No amount of nation-building will convince that country that an external power can better manage their affairs than they themselves can.<br /><br />Ferguson believes that America will remain the dominant military and economic power for the forseeable future, and that it has a leadership role to play.  With that I wouldn't disagree, I just wish he wouldn't call it empire.cit.

Centuries prior, Greek philosophy had been translated from Greek to Syriac by the Nestorians, an ascetic religious group skilled in linguistics.  The texts were further translated into Persian, and fell into the hands of the Arabs in the 7th century in their conquest of Persia. In the 11 century, Christian Europe finds, not only the writings of the the ancient Greeks, but commentaries by Arab and Jewish philosophers such as Avicenna, Averroes, and Maimonides.(I was reminded of a short story by Jorge Luis Borges called Averroes Search, in which Averroes was searching for the Arabic words for tragedy and comedy.)<br /><br />The Christian churchmen quickly recognized the importance of the discovery and had all the texts translated into Latin. At first they were stunned: Aristotle had written on everything form physics to metaphysics, from politics to art.<br /><br />Here begins the awakening of Europe from the Dark Ages.  It also marks the beginnig of the uneasy relationship between faith and reason.  Rubenstein, being a professor of conflict resolution, gives a very balanced account of the tension between the two.  It's almost as if he's their marriage counselor.<br /><br />By 1250, Aristotle's writings were required reading in all the major universities in Europe.  Aristotle's views, that the universe operated according to its own laws and that human beings were basically reasonable creatures, did not reconcile with the Christian worldview, that God created the universe and often intervenes in history.<br /><br />Rubenstein, in a very engaging narrative, takes us through the next four centuries of conflict involving many clever and colorful characters such as Peter Abelard, Thomas Aquinas, Bernard of Clairvaux, Duns Scotus, Wiliam of Ockham, etc.  There are many high level theological debates, heresy trials, excommunications, shifting of alliances and changing of positions.  By the time Galileo and Newton arrived on the scene, faith and reason had gone their separate ways (divorce) and the scientific revolution had begun.<br /><br />Being a good conflict manager, Rubenstein points out that both science and religion benefitted from their rocky marriage and that their children were left with a richer legacy.according to its own laws and that human beings were basically reasonable creatures, did not reconcile with the Christian worldview, that God created the universe and often intervenes in history. <br /> <br />Rubenstein, in a very engaging narrative, takes us through the next four centuries of conflict involving many clever and colorful characters such as Peter Abelard, Thomas Aquinas, Bernard of Clairvaux, Duns Scotus, Wiliam of Ockham, etc.  There are many high level theological debates, heresy trials, excommunications, shifting of alliances and changing of positions.

The point of the pun and the book is that America and Europe, despite sharing the common goals of Western liberal democracies, have sharply different - and diverging - views of the role of government and the uses of force in international politics.  After centuries of power politics and warfare culminating in World War II, Europeans have chosen peace.  According to Kagan, they have created a post-historical paradise, a Kantian realm of \\"perpetual peace.\\"  Their tools for dealing with crises and threats are negotiation, cooperation, treaties, and mutual security.  The United States, meanwhile, remains rooted in history and power politics.  Americans live in a Hobbesian world anarchy and constant conflict, which requires the use of power and military force.<br /><br />Kagan sees the merits of both sides of the argument, and gives a fairly balanced account of both perspectives.  Ultimately, however, he tilts towards the American point of view.<br /><br />Many neoconservatives view the European Union, and supranational forms of government in general, as a bureaucratic quagmire and weakening of state power.  Europeans, however, are weak because they have chosen to be - so they would no longer be threatening to each other.  Neoconservatives will note that this paradise that has been created was done under the protective umbrella of American power.<br /><br />Europeans believe - and rightly so - that they have a civilizing mission.  Their role is to serve as a model for other nations and regions.  Cooperation and mutual security are the preferred means to resolve conflicts.  When looking at regional conflicts such as Pakistan and India or, say, China and Taiwan, we should all hope they take the European path to conflict resolution.<br /><br />Towards the end of the book, Kagan calls for better mutual understanding between Europeans and Americans.  Who wouldn't?  Kagan seems to be suggesting that Americans would do well to be a little more European.little more European.	2004-10-31

This was known as the arena of the great powers and, in the 19th century, Japan and the United States joined the game.  By 1945 most of the great powers were in shambles; there remained only the United States and the Soviet Union as two competing \\"imperial systems.\\" And after 1989 there was only one, the United States as sole superpower.  Many observers saw this as the global triumph of markets and democracy, and saw it as an end to the battle of ideas.  Francis Fukuyama called it \\"the end of history.\\"  However, with the events of September 11, the world is again plunged into history and the battle of ideas, this time looking more like Samuel Huntington's \\"clash of civilizations.\\"<br /><br />In his analysis of the present-day world, Cooper divides nation states into three types: premodern, modern, and postmodern.<br /><br />The premodern states are the \\"failed states.\\"  These states have lost their monopoly on the use of force; where governments have lost control to warlords, gangsters, terrorists, and other non-state actors (examples are Somolia, Liberia, and Afghanistan under the Taliban).  These states have lost their sovereignty and chaos rules the day.<br /><br />The modern states are sovereign states that pursue their own national interests.  They fit into the traditional balance of power or hegemonic scheme.  For them the world is a jungle and world government interests them only insofar as it furthers their national interests.  Prominent among the modern states are Russia, China, Brazil, and India; and most prominent among them, the United States.<br /><br />The postmodern world consists of nations that have relinquished much of their sovereignty to international governmental bodies, the primary example of this, of course, is the European Union.  In Cooper's words it \\"is a highly developed system for mutual interference in each other's domestic affairs.\\"  European states gain their power from being completely vulnerable and transparent to each other.  They operate on mutual security and rule of law.  War between postmodern states would be next to impossible.  Cooper believes this to be a higher level of civilization, but also sees the problem when not all states are postmodern.<br /><br />Cooper also rightly notes that the development of the European Union from the Treaty of Rome (1957) to the present day was underwritten by American power, without which it would not exist today.<br /><br />What is most interesting in Cooper's theory is the difference between how a postmodern and a modern state confront terror or genocide in the premodern world.  Postmodern Europe failed to respond to genocide in the Balkans nor could it respond to terrorist attacks originating in premodern states. The postmodern outlook prevents them from building up a unified military capable of intervening in a time of crisis.  Their primary tools are diplomacy and legal action.  The response of the United States, the pre-eminent modern state, of course, is overwhelming military force.  This, however, is insufficient and so unsettling to the rest of the world that is counterproductive and destabilizing.<br /><br />According to Cooper, the key ingredient needed is legitimacy.  Yes, military force is needed but it must be done in a multilateral way to bring along the rest of the world for a successful outcome.<br /><br />Cooper's argument is much more complex than just described.  I highly recommend this book for those who are concerned about the dangers of the present and those on the horizon.h of their sovereignty to international governmental bodies, the primary example of this, of course, is the European Union.

These two systems working hand in hand will bring about, not only prosperity and individual liberty, but will eradicate war and ethnic violence.  We can still recall Thomas Friedman claiming in his best-selling book, The Lexus and the Olive Tree, that no two countries that both have MacDonalds have ever fought a war against each other.  Since then American aircraft have bombed numerous golden arches in Belgrade.<br /><br />In World on Fire, Yale law professor, Amy Chua shatters some of our most cherished Wilsonian ideals.  To have multiethnic, pluralistic, free-market democracies is the end goal of, not only American foreign policy, but of Western and international institutions as well.  However, there have been unintended consequences.  The main thesis of this book is that \\"the global spread of markets and democracy is a principal, aggravating cause of group hatred and ethnic violence throughout the non-Western world.\\"  In many of the world's developing countries wealth is concentrated in the hands of \\"market-dominant minorities.\\"  The best examples of this are the Chinese in Southeast Asia, the Jews in Russia, whites in Zimbabwe and South Africa and whites in Latin America.  Her other examples of Jews in the Middle East and Americans as the global market-dominant minority are problematic and do not fit her theory as neatly.<br /><br />Chua's most convincing case is of the ethnic Chinese in Southeast Asia, a market-dominant minority of which she is a member.  She gives a personal account of how her Aunt Leona, part of the economically powerful Chinese minority in the Philippines, was stabbed to death by her chauffer.  Other servants, all ethnic Filipinos, were eyewitnesses; however, the police, also ethnic Filipinos, never tracked down the killer.  They showed little interest in solving the crime and wrote it off as simply an act of \\"revenge.\\"  Not surprising since the Chinese are just 1 percent of the population and control about 60 percent of the private sector wealth, while two-thirds of the eighty million ethnic Filipinos live on less than 2 dollars a day.  A disproportionate amount of wealth is concentrated in the hands of the ethnic Chinese minority in Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and other countries in Southeast Asia.  The majorities largly view them as thieves who have ingratiated themselves with dictators while prospering at the expense of the indigenous population (two examples are Suharto in Indonesia, Marcos in the Philippines).  With the advent of democracy the ethnic Chinese were put in danger of the larger populations.  After the Suharto dictatorship, demagogues emerged, inciting violence aginst the Chinese.  As a result more than 5,000 Chinese shops and houses were looted and burned in Indonesia.<br /><br />Chua describes the pattern: \\"When free markets are pursued in the presence of a market-dominant minority, the almost invariable result is backlash.  This backlash typically takes one of three forms.  The first is a backlash against markets, targeting the market-dominant minority's wealth.  The second is backlash against democracy by forces favorable to the market-dominant minority.  The third is violence, sometimes genocidal, directed against the market-dominant minority itself.\\"<br /><br />Chua is not an anti-globalist, nor is she against free markets and democracy.  Countries such as China, Taiwan, and South Korea, all ethnically homogeneous, have done well with gobalization.  Democracy and free markets also work well were inequality of wealth and income are not too great.  Chua proposes that market-dominant minorities should spread their wealth, stop funding corruption and contribute to charities, and that governments should increase educational opportunities, create social safety nets, ensure property rights, and increase equity ownership in local business.  All of this soundsreasonable and commendable but will probably never happen.<br /><br />Inspite of some of the shortcomings of this book it alerts us to the dangers of encouraging laissez-faire markets and rapid democratization in countries with market-dominant minorities.  Anyone reading this book can see more clearly the highly combustible situation the US faces in trying to impose democracy in Iraq. The market-dominant and power-dominant Sunnis will undoubtedly loose their position to the Shia majority if elections are held.  The result could be sectarian strife or civil war.  However, not having free markets and democracy would probably be worse.

This dehumanizing view of the West, as seen by its enemies, is what the authors call Occidentalism.<br /><br />It is the reverse side of the idea of Orientalim described over twenty-five years ago by Edward Said.  According to Said, the  Orientalists constructed accounts of the East as a place where life was cheap and inferior to that of the West.  These narratives served to justify Western domination. Occidentalism, however, goes a step further: whereas, the Orientalist wished to subjugate and colonize, the Occidentalist wishes to destroy.<br /><br />This is a book about ideas rather than policy.  It deals more with why they hate us for what we are, rather than why they hate us for what we do.  The authors describe a \\"constellation of images\\" of the West by which its enemies demonize it.  They (the enemies) see the West as \\" a mass of soulless, decadent, money-grubbing, rootless, faithless, unfeeling parasites.\\"<br /><br />The originality of this study comes from the discovery that many of the negative images that the present-day Islamists have of the West are derived, paradoxically, the West itself.  The authors see a \\"chain of hostility\\" that goes back two centuries.  The anti-Western impulse begins with Herder and the German romantics as a reaction to the rationalist, universalist ideals the Enlightenment and the materialism of the budding capitalist economy.  Anti-Westernism was also the driving force of the slavophiles of late nineteeth century Russia; it was a reaction to encroaching modernization coming from the West.  In the twentieth century, Nazi Germany and a militant Japan railed against, not the modernization that came from the West, but the destruction of their indigenous cultures, being overrun by the decadence and depravity of the West.  This anti-Westernism again rears its ugly head in the late twentieth century during the Cultural Revolution in China and, again, in the killing fields of the Khmer Rouge.  These where particulary murderous  attempts to root out Western influence.  The Occidentalist of today is exemplified by the Islamist suicide bomber.<br /><br />Buruma and Margalit discuss four images of hatred that run through these movements of the last two hundred years: 1} the cosmopolitan city with its rootless, greedy, and decadent citizens; 2) the bourgeois merchant, seeking only profit and comfort, as opposed the self-sacrificing hero of the Occidentalist; 3) the Western mind, using only the faculties of science and reason, and neglecting faith; 4) and last of all, the infidel, the unbeliever, who must be crushed to make way for the true believers.<br /><br />In Occidentalism's present-day manifestation, religion plays a central role.  The jihadis of today hate, not only the West, but the secular regimes - such as Syria and Egypt - of the Middle East as well.  They despise even the Saudis for not being sufficiently pure.  Ironically, Saudi Arabia is one of the primary sources of the Wahhabism practised by Osama bin Laden.  Jihadis see the West as cowardly and fearful of death.  They, themselves, love death and wish to inflict it upon as many others as possible.  Their search for weapons of mass destruction makes them an extremely formidable enemy.<br /><br />From this excellent little study, one can only speculate whether the Islamist Occidentalists will someday come to accomodate the modern secular world or succeed in annihilating it.  It is safe to say that the struggle will not end anytime soon.eir indigenous cultures, being overrun by the decadence and depravity of the West.

In order for democracy to succeed it must be accompanied by what he calls constitutional liberalism.  By constitutional liberalism he means \\"a bundle of rights\\" that includes freedom of speech, assembly, religion, rights of property and contract, all constitutionally guaranteed and enforced by independent judiciary.  Democracy that is not founded on the constitutional limits of state power can easily lead to mob rule, populist demagogy, or what he calls \\"illiberal democracy.\\"<br /><br />Zakaria traces the history of Western liberalism from the Middle Ages to the present and shows that a full democracy is the culmination of centuries of struggle to build liberal institutions.  The struggles between church and state, lords and kings, Protestants and Catholics have all contributed to the creation of institutions within Western society that are independent of state power.  According to Zakaria, the most powerful force for human liberty has been market capitalism.  With capitalism comes the middle class, and with the middle class comes the rule of law.<br /><br />Some countries - such as Russia and Venezuela - that did not have the benefits of these historical struggles have become \\"illiberal democracies.\\" The current regimes in these countries have routinely ignored the constitutional limits of their power after having been democratically elected.<br /><br />There is an excellent chapter that deals with the Arab and Muslim world.  He speculates - as do some of the current leaders in the Middle East - that if elections were held today islamic fundamentalists would be swept into power.  As an alternative, Zakaria favors liberal autocrats such as Pervez Musharraf of Pakistan or King Abdullah of Jordan.  These rulers are establishing liberal institutions through political and economic reform before making the transtition to full-fledged democracy.  Countries that have successfully made this type of transition are, according to Zakaria, South Korea and Taiwan.<br /><br />In the second half of the book, Zakaria argues against excessive democracy in America; it is here where he is not as convincing.  Too much democratization, he claims, has lead to many of America's current problems.  Power has been shifting downward politically, economically, and culturally.  With the empowerment of individuals has come the breakdown of hierarchies, the old power elites.  Democratization has been a race to the bottom.  Whether in political parties, think tanks, journalism, or the professions, the public-minded elites are no longer in power to insulate policy-making from the pressures of the few and the moment.  We are now at the mercy of polling, lobbyists, professional consultants, and activists.  Everything has succumbed to the forces of marketization, much of which, has been detrimental to the larger public interest.<br /><br />To remedy this, Zakaria would seek to reinvigorate the elites who would ideally be looking out for the interests of the public as a whole.  He argues for more delegation of authority to independent bodies - his favorite examples are the Supreme Court and the Federal Reserve.  Critics would say that these bodies are not as independent as they may seem.  The general problem that arises here, of course, is what will keep the elites virtuous.<br /><br />Zakaria deepens our understanding of the problems of democracy and freedom.
