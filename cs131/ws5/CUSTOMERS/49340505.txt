I enjoyed reading about my sosai, but first of all the book is quite short. I read it in one evening. It will take at most two if you have other things to attend to. Second, add to the brevity of the book, it is very repetitious. And as most of the repetition is about the &quot;legendary exploits of the godlike Oyama&quot;, you'll soon start feeling like you're going to throw up your lunch. When you just think you've seen the last of it, another chapter starts by reciting how many challenge fights and how many bulls Oyama has beaten and how many months he trained inhumanly in the mountains and so on. Just too much of repetition for such a short book overall. I've also heard rumours that there are some factual errors in the book, but don't have any further info about them. Some obvious typoes are repeated throughout the book (like goju-ryu is spelled gojo-ryu). Also, quite an amount of the book focuses on other aspects than Oyama, things like the different kinds of sparring practice and the different master instructors and tournament champions of kyokushinkai. Perhaps the book should've been named &quot;Oyama and His Karatekai&quot;. It definitely should've been longer and less repetitious.	2003-08-12

After reading this book you are ready to continue on web-based articles on specifics and advanced features. I also liked the fact that this is not one of those five-year old books with obsolete/deprecated code.<br />But this book is far from perfect. I think the Java basics -chapter is too long. It almost presumes no pre-knowledge of Java. The author should not have wasted so many pages on Java basics. Also, the book doesn't go that far either. After you know how to listen to the mouse/keyboard and how to double-buffer your animation for smooth operation, you're left alone.<br />I would have liked to see some interesting real projects done through the book, maybe a small-scale scroller shoot'em up or whatever. Now you get shown all the pieces separately but ain't shown how to solve the puzzle.	2002-12-20

But Linux/Unix has long been a mystery to me. I installed Red Hat 7.1 onto my home computer and the automatic installation was easy enough but then I was dumbfounded. I tried to get some jobs done, like installing software, viewing files etc. but didn't know how.<br />This book does not tell you everything. In fact, you need to get some other book that is completelly about Linux administration and command line use. But for using the Gnome windowing system, this book is a great start. In a couple of days I was using Gnome like Windows, with no trouble.<br />Now, I just need to dive deeper into Linux admin and command line use... ;)	2002-05-16

I learned Java from Core Java 2 and Servlets/JSP from Core Servlets and JavaServerPages. Occasionally the Core series has disappointed me a bit (Core JSP) but never this badly. This book is awful. I have experience doing serverside Java/JSP, using MySQL, Tomcat and other Open Source products/libraries. But when I needed info on doing stuff with PHP, I got nowhere with this book. It is a non-comprehensive reference, when other Core books have been good and to-the-point guides. I bought the book by Luke Welling and Laura Thomson, &quot;PHP and MySQL Web Development&quot; and found it to be a LOT better. Actually, it is one of the best programming guides I've ever read.	2002-05-07

Well, you can forget about the applications, they are few and very basic level. It is a nice reference to the form if you already know it or when you just learned it and try to work it out at home, but you cannot learn any of the moves from this book alone. There should be more description or some kind of arrows drawn on some photoes or just plain more &quot;in-between&quot; photoes. You see pic 1, then it says stuff like &quot;curl your arm, rotate your palm upwards, extend the fingers, rotate it clockwise as far as it goes, make a fist, blah blah...&quot; then you see end result pic 2 and wonder &quot;how did that happen?&quot;.<br />The chi-sao and qi-qung sections are a joke.<br />The only fun part of the book is the history of Ip Man. It is worth reading if you don't have to pay the price of the book (see local library). The second star is for the history section only.	2002-03-06

See what you missed when chose Shotokan over Okinawan styles. This book reinvents the meanings of kata movements. In traditional Okinawan styles (such as Jundokan Goju Ryu, Seibukan Shorin Ryu, etc.) the meanings of kata movements a.k.a. bunkai were never forgotten. They are actively trained in all traditional dojos. But when competitions and commercialism were added to many styles, the meanings of kata movements were forgotten (in those styles that chose the new approach). Now this book reinvents the wheel by going through the kata and figures out the application.<br />If kata bunkai is what you are interested in, all you should have done is go to different school, where these things are actively trained and sparred with from square one. But if you already are deep in the modern mud of Shotokan and similar schools, you may want to read this book to see what you are missing.	2002-03-01

This book failed to deliver.<br />The book had very simple (I mean EXTREMELY simple) definitions of what protein, carbs and fats are, but nothing more about them. Then it briefly described vitamins and minerals. That's all ok, but does it help yet? No it doesn't. When it comes down to figuring what to eat and how much, you can throw this book out the window. How much weggies? How many fruits, what kind? You're on your own.<br />The book then goes on to describe the \\"ultimate\\" supplementation plan. BCAA's ok. Then you get a whole chapter on Bee Pollen(!) and many chapters on other (stuff) that nobody would buy today. The stuff mentioned in this part of the book is just so outdated (...) that it is sad and disturbing stuff to even read. The book has not been updated for creatine, vanadyl, MRPs or anything from the 90s.<br />In the end of the book, there are three chapters on weight management (gaining, losing, peaking for competition). The gaining chapter is too simple, gee eat more. That's about it. The weight loss chapter is not much better (but a little bit yes). I think the third chapter may actually help some competitive bodybuilders, but I haven't tried it.<br />Last part of the book is a collection of some food recipes. I didn't find much of interest there.<br />I found this book to be a major disappointment and mostly waste of money. Unless you have no idea whatsoever about what carbs, protein and fats are in the most basic sense, you are better off with some other book.	2001-12-07

I would suggest another book like The Only Investment Guide You'll Ever Need.<br />This is not as bad as the first reviewer made it seem. If you only absorb half of what you read, you shouldn't even do any investing. There are risks in the markets, this book tells somethings about it AND it tells how to cope with them. The reviewer (or his dad) hadn't grasped the whole story. So sad to lose your money in the biggest garage sale of the recent history!

But most of the stuff is plain common sense you'll figure out in ten minutes if you just sit at a table with a pen and a paper and start counting your income and outcome and think about how should you use your money.<br />There are three aspects about this book that I'll consider:<br />1. The advice on how to get out of debt is adequate. But it is not as sound and clear as that in Your Money Or Your Life. Hey, you can even get similar results by just reading The Richest Man In Babylon and doing everything it suggests and you won't be let too far behind. What I found disappointing was that this book is only well applicable by an american. It is not impossible to transfer the advice to other countries, but you'll have to rethink most of the math and tables yourself.<br />2. The end has some advice on how to live cheaper than in the past. There are some good tips here, but about half of it is just plain common sense like &quot;buy in bulk and freeze it&quot;, &quot;strecth your juices&quot;, &quot;buy a used car&quot;, &quot;shop second hand if possible&quot;, &quot;if you need desperate money, sell something&quot;...<br />3. I believe in God and all, but c'mon I didn't buy this book to read a lecture on God and charity. There is _way_ too much stuff about faith, religion, worshiping god, &quot;giving the tenth&quot;, the Bible and such stuff. It is also not that good stuff. The same stuff is better told in The Power Of Your Subconscious by Murphy.	2001-09-17

It tells you a very simple, but extremely efficient method for investing your money. It also tells you why and how to do it.<br />It does not cover everything there is to investing, hey it doesn't even cover 10% about it.

But there are at least two problems:<br />1. Many of the ideas are quite weird. If you did several of the more elaborate &quot;tricks&quot; to your spouse, she might begin to wonder what on Earth are you doing, and perhaps not in so positive sense. If you keep &quot;surprising&quot; your spouse in his job, hiding stuff in her office, hiding stuff in her jacket pockets, keep sending stuff to her job and wherever she goes, she might begin to feel you are actually spying on her, keeping sure she is always where she says she is, sending a message to her co-workers and friends and constantly checking her pockets! So keep cool with all these ideas and only do them very rarely.<br />2. Most of the stuff is good for an ongoing relationship, but there weren't actually that many ideas on how to charm a relatively unknown girl on the first couple of dates. There were some ideas, but not many. And some of the ideas had the same problems I explained above: if you keep pulling such stunts on a relatively unknown girl, you might end up scaring the b-g:s out of her!<br />A collection of good ideas, but not a thorough guide to dating. Better for those who are already going steady.	2001-08-02

Ok, there seems to be some serious inconsistensies between one reviewer and the next. Some say this book is one-star trash, others say it's a five star gem. Weird, eh?<br /> I needed some serious design guidance at my first real work (not in school-class anymore with a teacher nearby). At first I decided not to buy this book because of some of the bad reviews. I bought couple of other books and got nowhere. Now I read this book too and wham was I surprised! This book is excellent.<br /> I find it very obvious now that the persons who gave this book bad reviews were either not good/experienced programmers at all, thus they didn't notice the actual points the authors were trying to convey at times, or the readers just plain read this book too fast with too little thought. It is easy to read this book without actually thinking, because the book does not look very dry or academic. It lacks the &quot;aura of seriousness&quot; just like the author's other book on Color UML, which some people mistakenly dismiss as somewhat of a childrens' book.<br /> This book is NOT about inheritance. It is NOT about interfaces. It is NOT about notification. Nor about threads. Many people thought it was and, of course they already knew those aspects from any basic Java book. This book is about DESIGNING a program using those features. Every chapter cuts the aspects you have to consider about the topic, into a handful of clear guidelines. Every chapter summarizes listing those guidelines at the end of the chapter. If you make the mistake of just reading through, &quot;Aha, yeah, of course... nice, seems smart...&quot; you don't really learn to use them. When you have read this book, go back to design your software. Now, at every step go through all the chapter summaries an APPLY all the guidelines to every design step you make. Then you'll slowly begin to learn. It will feel as if a lightbulb was lit inside your head. &quot;Oh, THIS is how it's done!&quot;<br /> After some experience, youonly need this book occasionally, after making the guideline design steps into routine habits. Your code will reflect this by being clear and very professional quality.<br /> Also, someone complained that only some of the UML notation was used. This is again NOT a book on UML. It is a book on the design process/steps that Coad &amp; Co feel are important. Nobody uses every aspect of UML. It is just too huge a notation language. You need to learn a subset that fits YOUR purposes. Some prefer the &quot;Use Case Driven&quot; approach, some &quot;Feature Driven&quot;, and so on.	2001-06-02

I quickly noticed that some of the material available on LDAP is not very good. I had two problems. Some books that are considered 'bibles' in this field are just too thick that I would ever have enough time to go through them. I have a busy schedule. And other books had a different problem, they were quite spesific (e.g. only showed programming LDAP with a single proprietary API and nothing else).<br />When I got really frustrated I went and bought this book on my own and thank god I did. This book is an excellent coverage of all the main directory topics and it does it in less pages than any of the 'bibles'. Yet it manages to go into much detail about actual protocols, layers and encoding issues. I highly recommend this book as the first (and maybe the only) book for anyone working with directories.<br />I did find one problem with this book, that dropped one star. The index is not good enough - often I found myself looking for a term or word that just wasn't there. I wrote to the author about it and he said he agreed. Many times I was able to find the info in the book but not mentioned in the index and it was frustrating a couple of times when I wasn't sure where in the book would the term be explained, if it was there at all.	2001-06-01

It is true that there are some typoes but they are mostly harmless. I don't know how many typoes are in the code samples, because I didn't hardcopy them. My &quot;system&quot; is to try to make up my own code by reading, trying to understand and apply, not by typing someone elses code like a monkey typist.<br />This book covers all you need to know about JSP but some preknowledge of servlets helps. Nothing fancy, just go through some servlet -tutorial on the web and you are done. You need to know the structure of a servlet, that is the initialization, destruction and the doService() method (incl. doGet() and doPost()). That will help you with JSP in general. Because writing JSP code is actually writing servlet code.<br />The first chapter is just an introduction. If you are in a hurry, you only need to read chapter 2! It shows you how to create JSPs and assuming you know java, you can do some impressive stuff right then and there. But if you want to create custom JSP tags, or need some samples as how to write database or ldap-applications (ie. you are not that experienced with java) then you will find all you need from the subsequent chapters.<br />Tryly worth having!	2001-05-25

During college courses I often wondered how the courses and textbooks would actually map to real life work as a professional programmer.<br />Now that I have some experience as a new pro, I know that many books and courses just don't deliver as far as real work is concerned. But I noticed that there were couple of books that were of constant help during a(ny) day at the office. Those books were the Core Java 2 books and Core JSP book of the Core series edited and partly written by Horstmann.<br />After finishing my first programming task, I noticed that knowing the syntax was far from enough in my job: I was not just a programmer &quot;monkey&quot; implementing someone's design. I was hired to be a developer who had to design his stuff from scratch, often without any help from the company staff. I began to hunt for a good yet simple design and architechture book that would explain a simple design process and also give pointers on how to implement the design into decent code. The Rational Unified Process that was explained to us in lectures was way too huge a system for me to use on small scale projects.<br />I had hard time finding books that would fill the bill, but I managed to find some. Because I had good experiences from Horstmann's previous work, I bought this book.<br />Good news: the book is good and does it's job more than adequately.<br />Bad news: even the title has 'Java' in it, this book does everything in C++. It wouldn't matter so much if the book was mostly about design issues, but it covers lots of C++ specific details like STL, memory management, multiple inheritance, etc. It also has two moot chapters: A C++ crash course and a Java crash course. Who buys this book to learn either of these languages? The preface says this is a book for the reader who knows the syntax already!<br />So, I would have given the book 5 stars, but I want to drop 1 or 1.5 stars because I had to skip entire chapters because the book was not a match with it's title.<br />I would have loved to exchange the language crash course chapters for a couple more detailed design and architechture chapters or some sample projects.<br />For a C++ programmer with basic understanding of syntax: a five star recommendation, for a Java programmer with basic understanding of syntax, 3.5 star recommendation.	2001-05-19

I didn't really like the book myself. It was quite verbose and apparently written by and for academics. The book asks the questions what is technophobia, and who are technophobic. It relates to dozens of previous studies conducted by the author and other researchers. It looks into things like Cognitive Development Theory, Social Learning Theory, etc. in order to define technophobia and to find out how best to deal with it.<br />This book is for two kinds of people: 1) researchers and students who are interested in technophobia in an academical sense 2) people who are in charge of designing the use of computers in public places like schools, libraries, educational and other public services.<br />I as a student of Usability and User Interface design got very little of this text. The basic stuff was sometimes interesting to me, but the academical form of the text was a downer. There were occasions where a sentence was cut of by references and continues after four (4!) lines of ref. listing. I had to reread the beginning of the sentence just to remember what was being discussed. The text uses the references as part of text constantly, in a very annoying way. Instead of saying &quot;A is B (Doe 1995).&quot; it says &quot;According to (Doe 1995) A is B.&quot; and that lessens the readability when it is present in every paragraph.<br />I had trouble deciding wether to give 2 or 3 stars. I gave 3 because I think that academic people will get more out of this text. If you are not one of them, beware!<br />PS. Every chapter ended with a very good summary. I found this very helpful when preparing for the exam of the class.	2000-12-08

The book is not verbose, it is just user friendly =). I mean, really, the book is a breeze to read, it is clear and not once was I unsure about anything it said. There is only a little more than 250 pages of actual text to read. Then there are excercises which I found helpful. Then there's a long list of references, which some people may find helpful when trying to find more information.<br />The most incredible part of the book, in my opinion, is the chapter on inexpensive usability engineering methods, that can easily be adapted by small companies without large budgets. They are really worth reading the book!<br />I believe everyone who wants a career in UI design should read this book first, before proceeding further. Those who are not usability engineers per se, will get all they need from this book (about interface-design), the UI pros will probably want to read other material too, but this is the place to start.<br />I would give 4.5 stars if possible. The book is not perfect. But I gave 5 stars to help the average rise a bit... ...hopefully.	2000-12-04
US	49340505	R1YYUTA0FOHG2D	0130819336	296731608	Core Java 1.2 : Volume 1 Fundamentals	Books	4	13	14	N	N	Not for a novice programmer!	If you are not an experienced programmer, don't buy this book. This book, when accompanied with vol 2, cover everything you need to begin a career with Java 2. But it covers it with such a style that is only digestable by a programmer who has been there with other languages. If you are a beginner stammering with the terminology, and especially if you are not a native speaker, you will probably spend lots and lots of hours just reading the text, let alone actually learning something. If you are an absolute beginner, try Instant Java. If you have programmed a little with some languages, but don't consider yourself to be an expert yet, buy the Sybex guide titled Complete Java 2 Certification Study Guide and go throught the Part 1 (about programmer's exam) to learn the Java 2 syntax and use of basic packages. I learned Java 2 with the combination of Core Java 2 vols 1-2 and The Complete Java 2 Certification Study Guide and I don't think there's any better combo. The Study Guide covers all the syntax trivia and tests you repeatedly. The Core books cover everything you need to know to begin a career when you know the syntax.	2000-11-25
US	49340505	R2SJISHZYFSG23	0805360549	21548199	Modern Database Management (5th Edition)	Books	5	34	36	N	N	Amazingly well written	I bought this book for a DBMS course in a university and I liked it. This is the best written book compared to any IT book on any subject I've read. Everything seems so easy and simple with this. And this covers a lot of ground, enough at least for any basic level DBMS course. It covers the basics, SQL, (E)ER-diagrams, O-O db's, warehousing, etc.<br />What this is NOT: this is not a hands-on guide for real work. This is the first introduction to what you should know before beginning any DB-related work.	2000-10-28

This book is excellent, I also own the C and Java versions and I love them all. For a long time I knew the basics of programmin, I knew Basic, VB, C, C++ and Java, but I really couldn't get anything advanced done, I simply got stuck and didn't know what to do and how.<br />This book changed it all. But make sure you are ready for this. Some have said that this is for academics only or that it is too difficult. You MUST know the basics first! Someone complained that the code is uncommented, Geez... The code fragments are quite short and very basic C++. If you don't know how to handle structs, templates, pointers and variable operations, then don't complain that this book is too difficult. You just haven't got the basics yet.<br />When you know the basics but need to know how to store data into the memory for the optimal use (instead of relying on arrays for everything), you must read a book on Data Structures and this book is among the best. Yes, it makes you work, yes you have to read carefully through the examples, but that is the nature of these things. You are no longer a beginner in first grade.<br />It is good to know some math, but if you don't need to learn the analysis (mostly for academic use) then you can skip the analysis stuff. Just learn to implement the structures and algorithms, the text will tell you which are the best ones.	2000-10-23

Someone said earlier that if you only buy one Java book, make it this one. I strongly disagree. You cannot make Java applications for commercial use with this book alone. This book covers the syntax of Java but leaves the API out. You would need another book to learn it. Of course, if you are very experienced and a complete nerd, you might learn the API from the online docs alone, but if you want someone to explain how to really use them, then you need another book. I bought this book first but sold it later. I replaced this with the Core Java 2 volumes 1 and 2, which cover all the fundamentals of Java, including the core API you need to make real programs for real life use. Core Java 2 is not for beginners though.<br />In a nutshell: this is a good book but should not be your only book! You either buy this AND others, or leave this one on the shelf altogether (especially if you are on a low budget or in a hurry to get going with real-life programming).	2000-10-21
US	49340505	R2P0CZIGDBO6RR	0782128254	150078690	The Complete Java 2 Certification Study Guide: Programmer's and Developers Exams (With CD-ROM)	Books	5	6	9	N	N	Excellent for learning Java 2	This book is excellent for learning Java 2, even if you are not taking the exam. This book does not teach programming concepts, so if you are a beginner, pass this one. On the other hand, if you already know how to program in a language like C, C++ or something else (meaning you don't have to be taught things like algorithms, data structures and OOD) then this might as well be your first Java book altogether!<br />I learned Java 2 from Horstmann's Core Java vols 1-2 and used this to make sure I had what it takes to make a career out of it.	2000-10-21
US	49340505	R21UF0552HS333	0130819344	368388405	Core Java 2 , Volume 2: Advanced Features (4th Edition)	Books	5	41	41	N	N	Only if you don't own a previous edition	This book is great for it's intended purpose, but some seem to have confused what that purpose is. Some feel that because the subtitle is &quot;Advanced Features&quot;, this book would unravel the mysteries of the most advanced features of Java 2. Not so! You have to understand that this is nothing but a volume 2 of the Core Java 2 duo! The volume 1 has the fundamentals and this volume 2 goes to MORE advanced topics, compared to the first volume. This talks about JDBC, Corba, Swing, etc, but not very deeply, just advanced for those who have just finished volume 1.<br />I think the two books are the best option if you don't already have other similar books. If you have the previous 1.1 edition, or other very similar books like Just Java or Thinking in Java, then you'd probably get very little for your money from this one.<br />After finishing both Core Java 2 vols 1 &amp; 2 you have a very good basic knowledge of using Java 2 for different purposes and then you can buy a more indepth book on some aspect that you especially need (JDBC, Beans...).<br />A Very good book when combined with volume 1.	2000-10-07

It sure was a great book and I recommend it to anyone (and I mean anyone) who wants to really learn the O-O programming  inside and out. Just great text!	2000-07-25
US	49340505	R82B0NYXSV9JN	0671015206	826470409	The Millionaire Next Door	Books	3	17	18	N	N	Are you sure this is for you?	This book is like the Bible to some and pure garbage to others, depending on what you expect. This book is essentially a (long winded) study about the lifestyles of people whose net worth is over one million USD. Most of  the people mentioned do not live in the Hollywood Fantasyland, but live a  middle-class everyday lives with the satisfaction of being your own boss,  paying all the bills without trouble, having no mentionable debt and not  having to worry about your financial future. The book is NOT a self help  guide, though you can read between the lines and use it as such; Mainly,  don't use all your earnings, save at least 25% of your gross earnings and  invest them wisely. Use the rest of your earnings to pay for a  middle-class, common lifestyle without any fancy trappings. Keep your  friends and neighbours in the dark from the truth about your net assets.  <br />If you want a self help book to become rich yourself, this book can help  but is it the best one out there? No it is not. One good example of a much  better book for that purpose is &quot;Eight Steps To Seven Figures&quot;.  It is clearly a self help book, a real how-to guide. And it is more fun;  Instead of having faceless statistics of a supposed study, it gives the  names and faces of many self-made millionaires. It is more fun to read and  makes more sense.	2000-06-17
