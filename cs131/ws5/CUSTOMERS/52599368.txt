This story has a heroine who is such an annoying doormat that it is hardly credible in a contemporary romance. We have here a wimpy virgin who ironically is called 'Courage'. Courage Bingham is an award-winning management excutive of a prestigious European hotel. She quits her job and is now back in this sleepy Dorset town to look after her sick grandmother and try to raise the 10,000 pounds for her heart surgery. she tries to get a job, any job, even a part-time one stacking the shelves at a local supermarket. Then comes along Gideon Reynolds, a local tycoon, looking for a housekeeper for his grand home where he entertains important businessmen. Courage applies for the well-paid job and is shocked to find that Gideon is the boy she has a passionate kiss with in her dark summer house years ago. She is sent there by her vicious, conniving step-sister who plans to kill two birds with one stone --- to get this garden boy,who has the nerve to fall in love with her, fired and to disgrace Courage. Her plan works and now many years later,Gideon remembers Courage and wants revenge. What follows is standard fare. Gideon seduces her with the intention of making her his mistress and then abandong her later. But when he discovers she is a virgin, he finds himself in love with her. Actually, he has always been in love with her since that kiss. Isn't it something? Courage doesn't think or behave like a successful professional woman but a ninny. She is like putty in Gideon's hands. The story is so trite that it is simply boring.	2005-07-03

Just imagine Meg Ryan as the heroine who is a sharp-tongued and fiery-tempered young beauty engaged in a battle of wits with Tom Hanks, the sweet-tempered and good-humored hero and you've got this comedy of love.<br />Lucienne met Lord Perry Wittenden when their carriages collided and her carriage was all but destroyed. She lashed out at him though the accident was through no fault of his. Later, he published a humorous account of the accident in which she was depicted as a 'shrew'. This was not to be borne! He became her avowed enemy. Naturally, at their every encounter,conflicts ensued. There was sparring and choas. Lord Perry enjoyed himself immensely by baiting the wilful, spoilt young lady. Unknowingly, he had fallen for this captivating beauty. How they both realized their feelings for each other made most interesting reading. This is one of Elizabeth Mansfield's best. I enjoyed this book thoroughly and strongly recommend it to all Regency romance lovers.Don't miss it.	2001-12-21

I particularly like the idea of a lady James Bond -- the heroine being a U.S. undercover special agent around whom all the actions evolve. Diana McKenzie posed as the widow of the recently killed (or suspected murdered) Peter Foxe in order to get near his brother Lord Matthew Raleton who was the prime suspect of an international hi-tech smuggling ring. Lord Matthew, an English aristocrat, was rich , handsome and very intelligent and perceptive. He was also very affectionate towards his family. He never believed that Diana was his bother's widow despite the marriage certificate and was suspicious of her intentions. Nevertheless, he was attracted to her and found her more and more desirable. A string of events threw their lives in peril and brought their desire and attraction for each other into the open. Luckily, they were both cool-headed and smart enough to handle the dangers and their own emotions.	2001-09-08

The Captain's Lady opened with Gerard Schuyler, scion of the rich and illustious Schuyler family in New York, was back from England for his grandfather's funeral. The old man was said to be the richest man on earth.He was astounded to find Mrs. Victoria Slade, rumoured mistress of his grandfather, present at the funeral. He was further shocked and infuriated  to learn at the will-reading that he was the sole inheritor of his grandfather's huge fortune on the condition that he wed the notorious Torry Slade. Further incidents pushed him into this marriage of convenience for their mutual benefits. At first, he felt nothing but contempt for this piece of fluff, who strangely, was head of a small newspaper. She was young and beautiful, sophisticated, refined but very independent.He was attractive in a rugged, virile way, exuding  masculine charm. The chemistry between them was very strong so that they became unavoidably drawn to each other. Gerard found his feelings gradually changed from disdain to intrigue, then from desire to admiratiion, infatuation, love and obssession. Torry, although slowly falling in love, could still contain her emotions. But Gerard, a seasoned rake, who could have any woman he wanted, found himself wanting only one woman, the woman he was married to but could not have. He was in agony.He would do anything for her and to get her. He fought a duel to defend her honor and grovelled at her feet begging for her mercy. he wanted only her --- Torry --- to be his wife and partner in life, not in name only . The passion is so intense that I held my breath and only when Torry finally accepted him did I let out a sigh of relief. I highly recommend this book.	2000-12-28

Lady Hope Blissfield and her companion were stranded in a sudden snowstorm which drove them to the door of the notorious rake, the Marquess of Amberton, who was in the middle of  raucous bachelor party. Refused to be turned away and driven to her death, Lady Hope not only insisted on being received as a guest but on proper behaviour from her host and his dissolute friends. There was a lot of sparring between the two and the Marquess was always baiting her with his innuendoes. A young lady with a strong will and great spirits, she set about improving his household and reforming him. Gradually and imperceptibly he was attracted to her and came under her influence. On the other hand, Lady Hope fell in love with the handsome, witty and charming Marquess despite the knowledge that he was well known as a heartbreaker and had vowed never to wed. She saw through his veneer of dissipation as a gentle and caring man whose heart had been hardened by the scars of his childhood miseries. Although he knew that Lady Hope could be his redemption, Marquess Amberton felt he did not deserve her . He ignored his heart's prompting and her double entendre and open challenge. When it was time for her to go, he did not want her to go but he could not offer for her. And Lady Hope was in despair. How it all ended is for the reader to find out.

When I was reading this book, Cary Grant and Deborah Kerr kept coming to my mind. This romance is light and pleasing and humorous, just like the film An Affair to  Remember. The hero is Nick Carleton, a film star from U.S.A. --- handsome,  rich, charming, pleasant and kind -- the typical Cary Grant image. He  rented a cottage in an English village for the summer for vacation and  there he met his neighbour, the young,beautiful and cold English rose  Abigail Smith. At first he was intrigued by Abby's unfriendliness and total  ignorance of his name and status. He was attracted to her and set out to  thaw her coldness with good humour and charm. Abby was suspicious and  distrusful of all males especially Americans as she had been seriously hurt  by one. She refused to judge Nick objectively and fairly but luckily in the  end she realized her mistake in time and would not deny her own heart.   This romantic comedy is very enjoyable and highly recommended	2000-06-14

They started out as a poor but happy couple, passionately in love. But as years  went by and Oliver became more and more successful, they began drifting  apart. Oliver spent most of his time in London while Francesca was tucked  away in a beautiful house in the country. Now that their only son was sent  away to boarding school despite her protest, she felt her life was lonely,  empty and purposeless. It was the last straw when Oliver could not make it  home for their 10th wedding anniversary. She was fed up with their phoney  marriage. She would no longer be taken for granted. She decided on an  impulse to leave her husband<br />This is a fascinating story because of its  all too familiar real life situations with which women, especially  non-working wives, will empathise. We have a marriage going stale and a  husband in danger of straying. What will the wife do? Francesca, although  shy, gentle and reserved, was no fool. She knew the problem lay with their  seeing so little of each other and this had to be rectified. A much more  serious one was Oliver's glamorous and ambitious secretary who made no  bones that she fancied and wanted to ensnare him. Francesca kept her cool.  She gave her husband surprise after surprise. She was no longer the  self-effacing pushover wife, but a woman with looks, brains and business  sense who could hold her own. Before she took him back, he had to recognize  their marriage as an equal partnership.<br />The floundering marriage plot can  be a let down for being cliched with a less skilful writer. But Charlotte  Lamb is wonderful and I was swept into the flow of the story and totally  captivated. we get to look at the marriage problem not only from the wife's  angle but that of the husband. We glimpsed his inner world. Even a  successful man can be vulnerable; he has his fears and insecurities and  needs reassurance from his wife in the form of attention and passion . But  he would not tell his wife. The lack of commuication and understanding   nearly killed their marriage. Luckily it had a happy everafter ending which  is most satisfying.	2000-05-17

I love the way she explores the emotions of the characters which touches my heart. Here, two tormented souls found peace and happiness through misunderstanding and understanding.<br />Rye Parrish and Lillian  Renard came from totally different backgrounds. He was a wealthy, rugged  Texas rancher while she was a rich, dainty and refined NY socialite but  they both suffer from the same pains and hurts -- starvation from love and  affection and abandonement by their mothers. They met under strange  circumstances. Lillian was ordered by her autocratic grandmother to go to  Texas to break up the impending marriage of Rye's brother,Chad with her  wayward sister, Rachel. Rye wanted the same thing. He had an undisguised  contempt for rich, spoilt, pampered socialites because his mother was one  who heartlessly abandoned her family for the selfish pursuit of personal  pleasures. Thus, he was boorish, rude and hostile to the reserved, timid,  cultured and delicately pretty Lillian from the start. The hilarious  rattlesnake episode brought their mutual attraction into the open. He was  so ruggedly handsome, virile and male while she was so sweet, gentle and  femininely soft. Then gradually, he discovered Lillian was not what he  thought to be. The feelings of tenderness and protectiveness she aroused in  him changed their relationship and he fell in love. Now, Lillian's  grandmother was bent on nipping the romance in the bud. The rest is for  readers to find out.	2000-04-30

It is not about a torrid relationship between a secretary and her boss but rather as a journey of self discovery. Duncan, hot tempered ,  fiery , tall,dark and handsome , is the head of the Labyrinth, a Hi-Tech  company where Kalera , a cool , gentle blonde, is his secretary. Unknown to  her, Duncan has been secretly drawn to her all the time but kept his  feelings in his heart as he  was friendly  with her husband until the  latter's death. When Kalera tenders her resignation with the bombshell news  that she is going to marry his competitor and one-time friend and business  partner Stephen, he takes action to stop her from making a mistake and  tries to win her for himself. The story is fast-moving and the characters  well-drawn. I must applaud the writer for her imaginative and skilful  writing.	2000-02-19

It starts off quite well with Zoe, the attractive English companion to a rich Greek girl standing up to her employer -- the girl's handsome, virile   brother Alexis,for his consevative ideas that women should be under male  domination and be submissive. Later,attracted to her and mistaking her for  an easy lay because of her liberal views ,Alexis seduced Zoe but was  guilty-stricken to find that she was a virgin. He offered to marry her. Zoe  was attracted to Alexis and found herself falling in love with him but felt  she could not enter marriage with a man who did not love her but only tried  to do the honorable thing.So she kept on doing infuriatingly stupid things  like deliberating provoking Alexis by flaunting herself at two Englishmen  who tried to get a free ride on Alexis' yacht..etc. Although she knew what  Alexis demanded was reasonable, she deliberately went against his will to  show that she was an independant woman. This really makes the reader lose  patience with her. Then suddenly, everything is resolved . They professed  their love for each other; Zoe loved his country and his people and  deicided ot marry him. Sounds too easy  to me!Kay Thorpe did better than  this in some of her other books I have read.	2000-02-17

When Ceidre was given ten lashes as punishment for  treason in helping her brother to escape prison, Rolfe ordered  his man  &quot;do not break her skin &quot;. During the whipping, he clinched his  fists, his heart fluttering.When the whip fell again and again with  Ceidre's moans and cries of pain, his heart suffered such anguish that he  had to grip the hitching post near him with all his strength.

The plot shows great promise but the contents lack substance and credibility. The hero, Tarquin Rome invited three beautiful ladies and  their parents, to be his house guests at his Kent country estate. He had  been pressured by his mother to marry and fill his nursery and he intended  to choose a bride from among the three Incomparables. He was not in love  with any of them and &quot;took pride in the fact that he had never  succumbed to the awkward and messy business of falling in love&quot;.He was  dismayed to learn that his mother had included in his house party Lady  Leverham who was bringing her pet monkey and her niece Sibyl Cameron.As far  as he could remember, Sibyl Cameron brought nothing but havoc in her wake  and was responsible for the several injuries he suffered in the few times  she stayed at Rome Castle. He did not care much for her or her aunt's  company . The house party did not go as well as he had hoped and he  committed some faux-pas such as scratching himself in front of the  assembled guests because the monkey's fleas had got on him. There were  other mishaps like his going swimming in the middle of the night and  afterwards found his clothes missing and had to go home naked. The whole  house was roused by a scream  at the   most inappropiate moment when he was  getting up the stairs leading to his room ...etc. All these were too much  like  scenes from some slapstick comedy. What makes the story most  unconvincing is that Tourquin had never felt attracted to Sibyl and there  was no chemistry whatsoever between them .She had never inspired any  romantic notion in him throughout the greater part of the story although  she was in love with him. Therefore the sudden twist at the end is both  contrived, hypociritical, incredible and unsatisfying.	1999-08-08

The story is flimsy ,drags terribly and stretches my patience. You will only like this book if you like your heroine to be silly, childish and dim-witted which is exactly  what Joy is  like in this story.Her silly prattle is irritating and her inability to  comprehend why her husband keeps telling her not to use magic or they may  suffer dire consequences if she is discovered by the ton to be a witch is  infuriating.The trouble is that she is such an inept witch that her spells  go awry more often than not and bring havocs. There is nothing I like about  the heroine and the way she lets her ermine eat away the footman's hair is  reprehensible.She might be the Duchess, the animal her pet and he the  servant.

These heroines,although feisty, never step beyond  the boundary of decorum and propriety. Therefore I find the behaviour ofthe  heroine Georgie Carteret in LOVE'S GAMBIT reprehensible and in bad taste as  she behaves like a brazen hussy instead of a lady of quality. She is over  familiar with everybody including the stable boys, the servants ...etc.  Even by modern standard, she is brash, unreseved, forward and brazen. While  she could have let her servant nurse Augustus St. Regis , she stayed all  those weeks in his room thus deliberately compromisng herself and left the  Viscount no course but to do the honorable thing by marrying her.The  Visount, a stickler for propriety and good manners has never approved of  her behavor or liked her and marry her out of a sense of duty so it is  rather flimsy to make him suddenly loves her. I think the writer made the  mistake of writing this story as a Regency. It is highly improbable that a  young woman in those days would go that far and take such desperate  measures to snare a man. If it were written as a contemporary romance after  the fashion of Susan Elizabeth Phillips or Susan Anderson it would have  been a more successful story	1999-06-07

It is natural that the reader will compare them. I feel disappointed that we encounter the same 'big misunderstanding'  formula but the worse is that it is not half as well-written as WHITNEY,MY  LOVE. This book has not got the McNaught touch or flair.The characters are  shallow and inconsistent and the story lacks credibility.I particularly  find the beauty of Sheridan unconvincing. In her American homeland, she had  never turned any heads. On the boat across the Atlantic, nobody paid her  any attention. Then suddenly in London, she was lauded a beauty.Stephen  Westmoreland was no better. At the beginning of the book, he was the  perfect man-about-town --- smart,dashing, intelligent, sophisticated, suave  and charismatic.But the moment he met Sheridan, he behaved like a besotted  fool who found her every antic and faux pas amusing and charming.Is this  the Stephen we know? The man who could have the pick of almost any  beautiful woman in London but would not be ensnared? Sheridan lacked the  glamour,the sex appeal,the intelligence, the wit , the sharp tongue , the  social polish.... everything that Whitney possessed and endeared her to  everyone.Sheridan was brazen , impertinent and saucy without being  endearing. I was especially appalled by her going down the dining room  barefooted in her peignoir for breakfast and stunned the butler and  footmen. I cannot believe that Stephen , an epitome of urbanity and social  grace could tolerate her lack of propriety, etiquette and refinement. It is  totally out of character. In WHITNEY, MY LOVE, we have Clayton watching  Whitney grow up and blossom into a beautiful and alluring young temptress. He  was drawn to her gradually through a period of several years. But in UNTIL  YOU , the romance did not develop, neither did the characters, the writer  contrived them so that everything appears artificial and superficial.  Stephenfelt a sense of guilt towards Sheridan for her amnesia and a sense  of duty towards her well-being but this is not love. I find myself growing  more and more annoyed as the story progressed. I pray fervently that Ms  McNaught would write a better book on Nick DuVille.	1999-04-19

It is supposed to be a spy story interwoven with romance. Unfortunately, the  spying becomes the excuse to depict some passions. Therefore the story is  shallow and thin. The reader should not expect any exciting or thrilling  escapades in espionage--- there was none at all. The heroine, a country  mouse, embarked on a foolhardly and haphazard mission of revenge  single-handedly. She had only good looks but no brains. Without strategy or  help, she thought she would sleep with one of the suspects, General  Steigler, and he would disclose to her the secrets and thus she would find  her brother's murderer. How infuriatingly naive! There was no mention of how  she would extract the secret from the other two suspects.Anyway, it is an  unsatisfying read which  makes you annoyed with the heroine's ignorance and  the writer's writing skill.	1999-04-06

I thoroughly enjoyed this story of a mischievous and witty little imp of a  school girl who was such a troublemaker and pain in the neck that her  father decided to marry her off to the equally feisty brother of the Earl  of Edgerton. It was arranged that Kitty Birkinshaw was to spend a fortnight  at the Earl's estate to enable the young couple to get to know each other.  The ever inventive Kitty switched place with her abigail in a scheme to get  out of this arranged marriage.  However, Kitty, used to the position of  giving command, was too spirited and unruly to be a totally submissive  servant. Her sharp tongue and impertinence drew the attention of the Earl  and later he deduced from her personality and the scrapes she got herself  into that she must be Birkinshaw's wild,trouble-making daughter in  disguise.He was besotted but repressed the feeling and Ketty was also in  love with the Earl. This brazen, saucy little girl, knowing that the Earl  would never offer for a servant girl, had the nerve to offer to be his  mistress. The story is hilarious and titillating and of course ended  happily.I love the story. I love the characters -- the heroine is so cute  and endearing and the hero equally appealling.

A young man suddenly found himself not only the inheritor of a noble title with all its wealth and prestige but also the  guardianship of four beautiful young ladies. The Marquis of Rotherbridge found himself in the strange position of a fox trying to guard the hens.  The rakish Marquis was drawn to the eldest of the sisters who was  beautiful, voluptuous and alluring and set out to seduce her but all the  time trying to protect the virtue of the other wards from his libertine  friends and brother.The efforts at seduction and the episodes are very  romantic but not at all explicit and erotic like Laurens' later works e.g.  'Captain Jack's Woman', 'Devil's Bride'  but are actually much more  enjoyable. I would have liked to give it 5 stars except that I was a bit  dissatisfied with the ending which was rushed and made to look contrived  and abrupt. The writer made the four sisters succumb to their seducers  on  the same day and without the presence of a chaperon or abigail which was  highly improbable if not impossible. But for this flaw, the story is  perfect! I heartily recommend this book.	1999-03-08

The story is contrived and incredible. After reading several disappointing books with raving reviews, I'm getting wary about buying books which are  written by relatively new and unknown wirters.	1999-01-07

I read this book because the story outline looked appealing and because of the warm review. I was disappointed. The story has not much substance and it is loosely-knitted.	1999-01-02

This books deserves a bit more than 3 stars because it is not badly written. However,it is just another of those romances you read and will forget afterwards. What started me reading Ms Laurens' book is ' Four in  Hand' This is one of her early books and is a very delightful Regency  romance -- flowing and spontaneous. She has changed her style now. There  are many love scenes and so explicit. Somehow they do't seem very natural  and real. Honoria is not described as a ravishing beauty. She is not  voluptuous and it is unconvincing that Devil is so drawn to her that he  will decide to marry her. If he looks for good sense in a woman, the Tolly  incident is insuffcient for a life decision.There is no mention of her  allurements or anything to inspire lust or love in Devil who has a great  reputation with women.But this book is better than Captain Jack's Woman	1999-01-02

I am an avid reader of novels and I studied English Literature in college but I have never read any book as good and captivating as this. This is the only book other than 'Pride and Prejudice&quot; which I have devoured and  savoured again and again for I can't remember how many times. Judith  McNaught's flair and skill as a consummate writer is unsurpassed.This book  is more intensely passionate and compelling than 'Gone with the Wind' or  &quot; Wuthering Height'. It is more witty, sparkling and romantic  than'Pride &amp; Prejudice'. It is like a hurricane which sweeps you off  your feet.The hero and heroine have their flaws but these won't make them  any less lovable but more human and credible.Whitney, the ravishingly  beautiful heroine,is intelligent, witty but rebellious and headstrong. she  refuses to recognise her own heart and better judgement. She does not  appreciate but scorns what is handed to her on a silver platter -- the love  of the proud, rich, powerful and devastatingly handsome Duke of Claymore,  who offers her the protection of his illustrious name,a place at the  pinnacle of society, a life of luxury any girl would die for.She has a  school girl crush on a young man in her neighbourhood and under the  illusion that she is still in love with him after 3 years,continues to try  to win him over at all costs since she is one who does not accept defeat.  Therefore she spurns and rejects the courtship of the Duke,Clayton  Westmoreland. The Duke is no paragon, but his love for Whitney is very  touching. While he can have any woman he wants, he is in love with only one  and will only offer for her.In many situations, his patience and tolerance  are sorely tried and I can't help feeling sorry for him. The whipping  scene, which upsets some readers, does not offend me at all. Rather, it  shows the great understanding of human nature and strong character of  Clayton.He recognises that he cannot let Whitney walk all over him or else  he will never have herrespect.Whitney has done something very seriously  wrong which can lead to his and the horse's fatality.The whipping is a  lesson to a spoilt child, a necessary lesson in her growing up process to  be a reasonable and responsible being. He is taming a wild filly just like  he does Dangerous Crossing.But he soothes and mollifies her  afterwards.Through some twists of fate, the Duke gets blindingly jealous,  and in his terrifying wrath, rapes Whitney who has fallen in love with him.  Through another misunderstanding, the couple seem destined to heartbreak  and unrequited love. Fortunately, Whitney sacrifices her pride to win back  the man she loves. After marriage, there is still another trial, but  eventually, all ends happily.This book is vastly entertaining with the  humor, the sensual seductions and love scenes, the verbal swordplay and  witticism.Reading it is just like riding an emotional roller-coaster.There  are some heart-wrenching moments but it is so satisfying to see love  triumphs after all.It is 'must read' for lovers of novels and romance.	1999-01-02

After reading 'Double Standard', I found to my surprise that Judith McNaught could write  historical romance so well. I thoroughly enjoyed it.The characters are realistic. They don't fall in love rightaway. As the  story unfolds, you are drawn more and more into the emotions of the  characters. This is my second McNaught book and I can't wait to read more.	1998-11-27

You wil fall in love with Christopher and Sexton. Are there such perfect men  and lovers on earth? It makes you envious of Etrienne.This is a story that  you will not forget.

Athough this is not her best, I enjoyed it very much because it is so sweet. The plot is much simpler than others without so many twists as Skye O'Malley, which I think is the best  of her books, but the characters are endearing and convincing. which I  don't find in other books such as ' Love Slave' and 'Enchantess Mine' or '   Betrayed'	1998-11-02

US	52599368	R1DNVEEVKTKB31	0380789345	599616151	Brighter Than the Sun	Books	1	8	15	N	Y	Disappointing and Annoying	This is Regency romance at its worst. The characters are unappealing and unrealistic. Can you imagine a lady, especially a vicar's daughter,chattering to a stranger familiarly,cutting off his boot from his injured foot and letting him lean on her shoulder to limp back to his carriage?I was particularly upset by the scene in which the heroine walked in heavy rain by herself to the Earl's home. She turned me off by not only looking bedraggled and dishevelled, but by seeking out a bachelor in his home to discuss their marriage.She even changed into his married sister's clothes. No lady of good upbringing in polite society at that time would ever stoop herself or be brazen enough to compromise herself in this way. The whole story sounds unconvincing because there is no chemistry between the Earl and the lady.I got some very enjoyable books based on readers' reviews but I didn't get it right this time. Bad luck for me	1998-10-31
