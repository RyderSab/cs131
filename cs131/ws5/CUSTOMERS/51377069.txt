I knew it was very mean and cruel. As I reached the climax I suddenly realized that what was happening in the book to the victims (Linda \\"Blubber\\" and later Jill) was happening to me all the time with my groups of friends from the time I started school! Even preschool and in neighborhood situations, sadly enough. I have been at the middle (like Jill) and bottom (like Blubber) of the pecking order in cliques so I know what it's like. I have been picked on, beat up, tortured, teased, bullied. I was shy and quiet but more outspoken then the passive Linda \\"Blubber\\" in the book.<br />  The victim Blubber is portrayed as a bland character with not much to stay who lets people walk all over her so she becomes a victim.<br />  A few of these reviews sound very mean and almost sick by saying this was a \\"funny book\\" about a group of animalistic kids ganging up on someone. I get the impression that those reviews were written by very young readers. I don't recommend this book for young readers at all because of that. They may not understand it. (believe me, i didn't entirely either when i first read it at 9 either!)Also readers too young to understand feelings of others may copy the bad things about the negative characters (Wendy and Carolyn, the follower) like I did at times when I was young (I felt bad about it later and found myslef on the receiving end afterwards). Also the fact that some may not like the idea of a somewhat un-satisfying ending which is disturbing to younger readers.<br /> I didn't get the point at the time, but the reason Linda is singled out as a victim is not just due to her weight (although doing a report on a whale may have opened her up to ridicule), contrary to popular belief. If you read chapter 1 about when Jill introduces us to Linda as she is giving her whale report, you notice she just mentions Linda as the \\"pudgiest girl\\" in the class but says she's not the largest kid in the  5th grade; there's students who are fatter but not singled out as victims. So obviously that's not the thing that makes her the target. Apparently she's at the bottom of the pecking order because of her lack of personality and initiative.<br />  Wendy the ringleader is this overpowering, very pushy, aggressive manipulator. I knew quite a few \\"Wendy\\"s in my time. They're the people in who are sorta the homewreckers in your circle of gradeschool friends. They disrupt the peace and break up your friendships by stealing your friends. This book sorta hit home with the issue of loyalties with childhoold friendships and friction between them. I admire Jill and Tracy for standing together. Tracy was so good to Jill even if she probably didn't always agree with what Jill's inappropriate behavior. I had a friend like Tracy who defended me when I was being bullied and kept track of my abusers to tell my mom so we could report it.<br />  A lot of time the \\"Wendy\\"s get their way even with adults if they're allowed to. I knew a juvenile delinquent who beat me up and mostly got her way even when I ended up taking her to court on charges of harassment and battery.<br />  One reviewer stated that there is nothing adults/teachers/principals/school authorities, etc. can do and please, please please listen. I hope y'all will please read this. I am not criticizing anyone but I've been to hell and back. Trust me and don't believe the lie that there's nothing they can do and it's just up to the individual. You can't do it alone and feel like an outcast. It is the teacher's job to protect you and they are getting paid anyway. It sickens me to think of all the teachers striking for months on end in some areas. Some do deserve it if they're good teachers but they aren't even working an 8-hr shift and get weekends and vacations, and what about the ones who won't protect their student's? They need to wake up and pay attention to what's going on around them in class. Teachers needto be tuned in to the students and be on the ball.<br /> For this reason I'm glad Judy wrote this book because in jr high and high school I was harassed and wondered why! I was average size in grade school but picked on in jr high when i put on a few lbs. yet I'd see larger girls who apparently weren't victimized. I tried being loud and boisterous to be popular and that didn't work so I tried being quiet as a mouse and they still teased me--could not figure it out!! It wasn't the weight that was an issue! I read an interview with Judy Blume on Blubber and she explains that Linda was passive and kind of brought it on herself; She didn't stand up for herself. I was like that at times and needed to learn to do that. PLEASE do not fall for the lie that children \\"Ask for it\\". At school, very often when I'd go to teachers or principals for help and they acted uninterested, their response was that I must have done something to provoke the behavior. This is baloney. The truth is you have a right to an education free of harassment and torment. Some say it's just life and you can't expect much more but that is a crock. Life doesn't have to be like that! Believe me, I have had wonderful teachers who knew how to meet student's needs and teach respect and then again I've had bad teachers with no control and it was chaos. I've seen the good, bad and ugly so i'm not naive. I'm talking about a healthy learning environment. A teacher's job isn't simply to teach 2x2=4 and Columbus sailed the ocean blue. Think about it: 30 years from now; do you remember that stuff or are you more likely to remember the teacher who touched your life by making a difference with kind words, ect. it's more than just knowledge, it's about teaching the golden rule and respect.<br />I loved the book but I have mixed feelings about it so i can't classify it in one category.<br />  One reviewer said that parents think this book is realistic and I certainly hope to God this isn't true because it happens all the time in school. Pay attention to what your children are doing and how the teachers are handling things. They say \\"kids can be cruel\\". Well that's true. Some pass it off as \\"kids being kids\\" but please. We need to train a child in the way they should go. Where are the parents and teachers who are supposed to teach them manners and respect? Instead they act like animals and hoodlums. They say this is just a sad fact of like but this is a fact that needs to be changed. One reviewer said that \\"apologies rarely come in real life\\". That's true. I was raised with \\"good breeding\\" and always taught manners and if children were taught from birth the civalized way maybe they wouldn't behave this way.<br />  Like I said I wouldn't recommend to children under 12 and I'd read it with my kids and discuss feelings with my kids if I did.<br />  Like a reviewer said, what comes around goes around. What you sow, you will reap. But what doesn't make sense in the story is Wendy the ringleader is the instigator of the Blubber business. Wendy is cruel and ruthless.If you read original editorial review, note that it was WENDY who passed the note that started the whole thing saying \\"Blubber is a good name for her\\" and Jill isn't even thinking of Linda at the time; she's preoccupied with thinking of her plans for Halloween. She doesn't get drawn into it till Linda talks about whale blubber in her report and Wendy starts to laugh. By then word gets spread and everyone is laughing. Jill becomes a willing participant but not the true leader. Not to excuse her; she's just as guilty. But we see how far one person's meanness can get spread. Wendy's influince is all over the class and effects even the principal. Oddly enough when the tables turn it's Jill who becomes the victim, not Wendy.<br />  Wendy dosen't switch roles and remains the tormenter but Jill becomes victim and Wendy becomes her bully. Everyone begins ganging up on her. Linda isn't gracious towards Jill's gesture to sorta \\"rescue\\"her from the supply closet as Wendy's prisoner. Instead, Linda, a weak, subordinate character, becomes Wendy's \\"friend\\" and joins in the gang of tormenters who turn against the new victim, Jill.<br />  This book lacks some emotional depth in that it fails to totally identify with Linda's feelings. People think of her as a zombie. But she's a person and we all have feelings. Jill's mom did tell her to put herself in Jill's position but the parents seem so distant in this book! My mom was much more involved! She'd say \\"How would Linda feel?\\" and more! Jill has no sympathy for Linda and when the tables turn just has sympathy for herself...<br />  I was glad Judy wrote this book and it's a must-read some. It should be banned from some young readers though. It's a message that you can make a difference and you do have the power. It's not about a saccarine lala land. it's about doing your best!in school. Pay attention to what your children are doing and how the teachers are handling things. They say \\"kids can be cruel\\".

I was recommended this book by my counsellor at church when I was dating and going through turmoil, so I bought it and immediately it began ministering to me. It was like it was written just for me, like Joyce got inside my head and heart and knew what I was thinking and feeling. Through Joyce and her book, God has saved my life and my relationship with my boyfriend. I realize a lot of negative emotions I'd been carrying around like a stinking bag of rotten garbage, were my imagination and a manipulation of my emotions. Get your emotions under control; otherwise you will live a miserable life if it's controlled by mere feelings!	2003-02-23

I'm Trapped in the First Day of School	Books	5	8	9	N	N	AWESOME![.]	I recently picked this book up at a second-hand store while looking for kids' books. I'd never read this before but I thought it was based on an article/story in a magazine I remember reading in school in 7th grade about the same situation; being \\"stuck in the first day of school\\": waking up every day and having to start over again! I don't remember what magazine that was that that story was in; supposedly it was some educational/religious magazine since I was at a Christian school that year, however when I read this book, I discovered this book wasn't what I thought and probably had no connection with the story in the magazine although both were similar.<br />  When I read the first episode in the book about the first day, I was so mad at the main character's buddy Alex for how he treated people, especially poor Ollie, that I was just going to put down the book and not read it anymore but I'm glad I didn't because it gets better and better with every repeat first day of school! I cracked up laughing about the cafeteria's rotten food in spite of myself. That'd be awful but Alex the smart aleck got what he deserved, biting into a burger with rotten meat.<br />  I can't remember the main character's name, but we see him become a stronger person instead of a follower of the bad seed Alex, as he takes Ollie the new kid under his wing and saves his house from a fire, and befriends the new girl Amber; they have a great friendship going on!! The ending was wonderful. I like this book a lot better than that article I said I read in 7th grade that was similar to this story because it had a happy and satisfying ending, whereas the one in the magazine left you hanging on a cliff practically! Very clever story, beautifully written. Kudos to Mr. Strasser, keep up the good work!	2003-02-23

This book is well written and enjoyable; about 2 friends who always seem to get in trouble. You can learn a lot from this book. Beast and Matthew think they're in deep deep trouble when the school's rabbit-on-wheels (for the Easter play) \\"runs amuck\\" and loses it's head!! Parts of this book, like all of Giff's delightful books, made me giggle. She is a wonderful author...Beast thinks if he's quiet about the rabbit, the problem will go away but one thing leads to another and he accidentally mooshes his sister's jewelry box and feels terrible. Besides that he has suspicions that she is planning a party for him. Normally reading these books I saw his sister Holly as being like an obnoxious, bossy old cow, but in this book you see her becoming a good sister and he confides in her about the \\"Monster Rabbit running amuck\\". Wonderful book and character devlopment, however I think Holly still should've had a party for Richard since he was so depressed that the party she was planning was really for her class!	2003-02-23

All of these books have morals, without being overly preachy. Like the other reviewer said, I agree that the funny part was Stacy breaking the pencil sharpener. When I was Stacey's age I, too, \\"broke\\" a pencil sharpener but it was my mom's office pencil sharpener. I couldn't fit it back together so my mom was upset about the mess just like Ms. Zachary is in this book (however I was able to get it back together later on luckily). So when I read about Stacey's pencil sharpener dielema, I chuckled because I could relate!	2003-02-23

I used to like Dawn but not now; she has this holier than thou attitude that is more annoying than anything. She had no business making judgments about Sunny's behavior. Dawn is a girl who thinks she's \\"it\\" (NOT!) She has no business lecturing Sunny and telling her how to live her life. Dawn is far from perfect. She thinks everyone else is wrong and she's right.	2003-01-28

I was Stacey. She was my favorite character, and we looked a lot alike. The first early books about her were wonderful, but in this book this has got to be a different Stacey. She isn't the same. She is out of sorts. The book is well written but the reason I gave it only 3 stars was because it's not as good as the original books about Stacey and the gang.<br />  In this book Stacey makes poor choices and has some lousy friends who use her and she's an airhead about it. She is so naive when they are using her; she thinks they're still innocent. I'm glad Mrs. McGill disciplines Stacey and lectures her about wising up to these loser girls.<br />  It's a shame that this series had to change so much; they were wonderful in  the beginning. It's not a bad book, and a good read, just kind of cheesy at times.	2003-01-28

Ever notice how authors, and even music artists can put out some really good stuff in the beginnings but then later on they do stuff that isn't so good? Same thing with  some TV programs and cartoons. Well, the BSC characters in the 80's were my role models, and I looked up to them, sepecially my favorite characters, Stacey and Claudia. Dawn was another one of my favorites back in the day, but since then I'v changed my  mind about Dawn after reading books like this and also Mary Anne's Makeover. I used to think Dawn was fun and I, too, adore California. This book shows Dawn's true colors. She is a selfish spoiled brat, and her parents never discipline her. They give her everything and she's never happy! There were many times I missed Calif. but couldn't go back just any old time like Dawn.<br />  Now I realize what a snob Dawn is. I used to admire her, but now I see that she thinks she's it. Her whole time in Connecticut is spent comparing Conn. to Calif. and acting like she's too good for that state, and that nothing was good enough for her, and she thinks she's better than everyone because she eats \\"virtuous\\" foods (NOT!) What makes her think broccoli is better than chocolate?? Hello! That is a myth! Chocolate was not put on this earth to torture us, but for our enjoyment.<br />  Anyway Dawn needs some serious help! She needs to stop judging everyone and thinking she's right and everyone else is wrong, and being so selfish. She is not better than everyone, for crying out loud!	2003-01-27

On the Banks of Plum Creek was one of my favorite books since I was 9. For some reason I loved reading about Laura's life on Plum Creek. I knew there were stories she didn't feel like telling because it was too painful to write about yet I was curious about the rest of her life in Minnesota. I was so delighted to find this book! Like another reviewer said, I don't know if it should be considered part of Laura's original series, but it is still a joy. The author has a very positive yet non-saccarine way of telling the story, and she well-establishes the characters, showing what a loving family Laura has and how much she loves her family...you really feel like Laura is a part of you; almost a soulmate. I just wish Johnny had gotten what he deserved; he was such a rascal to Laura and her sisters. He should've known better than to pick on girls. If I was there I'd fix him for Laura!!	2003-01-27

I was a middle child among two other strong-willed children and the fights between Dawn, Jeff and Mary Anne sounded sooo familiar! I fought like heck with my brother and sister. My parents were driven half mad! I chuckled in spite of myself; kids fight over the silliest things and Ann has a gift of mixing a little black humor in with the strife. Good going, Ann!<br /> However I think that Dawn and Jeff are spoiled brats who didn't get enough, if any, spankings in their life. I would have taken them both to the \\"woodshed\\". They were very rude to their stepfather who was trying very hard to get to know them!	2002-09-25

I wish I had read this book when I was in jr high, because I can really identify with Mallory and what she goes through. I dropped out of P.E. in 8th grade because I couldn't take it anymore what was happening to me in our co-ed P.E. class. I wasn't the athletic type and was a klutz, and was harassed by the guys who would call me fat, etc. and it was a totally humiliating experience for me. I especially hated soccer, I just couldn't get it, and the guys took total advantage of this by slamming the ball into me ow!! They thought it was the funniest thing in the world to see me in pain. Like in Mal's situation, the school authorities couldn't understand why I'd refuse to go to P.E. Like Mal, I too was punished due to my failure to participate. By highschool I had a medical waiver so I didn't have to do P.E. at all. I was free! I don't think kids should have to suffer through P.E.; It is a dumb rule to have it as a requirement.

I grew up with the BSC, I read them in 5th thru 7th grade and this was the late 80's. The first 10 books in the series are the best. I have learned soo much about myself and other things by reading her books. One of the many things I learned was to keep a journal. Also, her description of the neighborhoods in Stoneybrook where the Baby sitters live reminds me of my hometown where I lived from birth to 11 years, Lynnwood, Washington (a suburb north of Seattle). Whenever I'd read about the club meetings, I'd think of it being at my old house in Lynnwood!!	2002-09-25

This book, and the Weigh Down program initially saved my life as well as my relationship with my boyfriend and with God, especially. I lost 100 pounds on the program and joined the church. Initially, I had written a positive review and given her book 5 stars. However, after being a member for 4 years I realized something was very wrong and that Weigh Down was no longer what it used to be, and that Gwen was not who I thought she was, and so that is why I have retracted my original review and given her only 1 star. I have met her, went to her house a couple of times, and even worked for Weigh Down! She has changed since the good old days. Yes, she changed, Weigh Down has changed, but God NEVER changes. What others are saying is true; it is a cult. Don't even think about joining a WD class and don't buy any materials published after 1999. I want to sound the alarm. It makes me want to yell, \\"Fraud!!!\\" When I think about it. I should know, I have been through it. Whatever you do, don't join the church or get involved in anything from WD after the 1990's decade.	2002-09-05

Bradley is the oldest boy in the class and perhaps doesn't know how to behave so he acts weird. Nobody likes him at first. This book really made me laugh and at the same time made me glad as Bradley improves in his interacting with other kids. I guess a valuable lesson learned in this book is that you only have control over yourself and as you change others around you will change their attitude towards you; for instance, Bradley's father is portrayed as a mean old man initially. But we see that as Bradley starts to change his behavior and makes an effort, his dad opens up and we discover that he's a devoted father! Bradley blossoms in this book and it is a great triumph! Way to go!	2002-02-07

I was a fat girl myself, well maybe not that fat, I guess I was considered &quot;pleasingly plump&quot;.  When I read it I thought it was good of Jeff to be kind to Ellen the fat girl. He decides he wants to be her friend and help her feel better about herself. It really shows you, however, how sometimes a helping hand can become a stronghold!!  In my experience, growing up, there were people I wanted to help and sometimes did too much for them, like young Jeff ends up doing. Jeff starts doing things for Ellen which she is perfectly capable of doing herself. It's a very interesting book with a non-saccarine ending.  If you read books on co-dependency or have been thru AA/AlAnon, etc., this book should be required reading. It's fictional yet a perfect example of co-dependency. It should accompany Melody Beatty's book, &quot;Codependent No More&quot;.  Not only is Jeff showing signs of codependency, but his mom and dad are, too. This usually runs in families and is a learned behavior.  Check out this book!!	2001-03-22

I had read all the other books about Marv's friends (Peter &amp; Veronica series, which are related to Amy &amp; Laura) and at first I did find this book hard to get in to. I think I was older before I was able to finish this book.  Marv is an inventor and his mind is always working, thinking of new inventions. HIs older sister is pretty but she's a witch. She is always screaming at poor Marv and he is constantly trying to please her. He bends over backwards. It is a funny book. It mentions Adolf Hitler a lot, as the story was set for that era; the 30's and 40's. THis story actually took place right before the Peter and Veronica series, so I recommend if you are going to read the series, the stories might make more sense if you start with Marv. I think it was the first book of the series, although the books arn't numbered in any order.  If you liked Encyclopedia Brown, you'll enjoy Marv!	2000-11-18

However I always thought that a fire was one of the most exciting news  stories in town and I remember in reading group in 2nd and 3rd grade I  loved reading about house fires--so interesting yet sad...it just freaked  me out that it could happen to me... I finally relaxed a little because I  realize my dad is an electrical engineer and could make sure our wiring in  our home wasn't bad. In 3rd grade the most exciting thing that occoured was  that late one October nite a family up the street had a terrible house  fire. Luckily noone was hurt but it was damaged terribly. We weren't  exactly friends with them, but I felt a lot of sympathy for them. I will  never forget going up the street to look at their burned house, with  charred furnature scattered in the lawn. Of course I will never forget the  smell...  a year and a half ago I was awakened in the early morning hours  to a rank stench in my room. The wall was on fire and smoke was pouring  out. Fortunately my dad realized the problem and corrected it (faulty  wiring). Thank God nothing was ruined or lost and noone hurt.  Anyway how  sad in this book, Mary Anne loses everything. I grew up with BSC; when the  BSC started out they were only a few yrs older than me. It was sad to see  the BSC that I'd grown to know and love seem to turn to ashes.	2000-08-06

It was just like the Baby Sitters Club, actually I liked it better.  However I recently reread it and so that was why I gave it a lower rating. I don't think it's really appropriate for  young kids because of the witchcraft and use of ouija boards. These books  are very inspiring and well written and the girls give kids lots of neat  ideas for fun sleepovers, but there are some things such as communicating  with the dead and ouija boards and witchcraft that should never be tampered  with. It may be all in fun, but not if you let it run your life like Patti  seemed to.  However these books are really good. Although not very deep, I  like them better than the Baby sitter books. About the truth or dare thing,  well I did that after I read this book--knocked on some guy's bedroom  window just like Lauren does!  Neat book.	2000-05-02

It is simple but a lot of fun for kids ages 4-8. I loved books of all sorts when I was 9 and I ordered a pile of books in the school's Scholastic book orders and this was one of  them. Even my sister, who was in kindergarten at the time, could enjoy this  book on her own.  The mice play tricks on the cats and so the cats  retaliate--that part was a surprise and a delight to me! When I teach class  I will share this book with my students! It is wonderful!  If you like  the classic Pied Piper, you'll love this one!	2000-04-29

I was in 2nd grade when I checked this book out at the library when I went there with my Brownie troop. Actually I spent my whole library time being undecisive about what book I wanted and there was this table full of reject books (ones kids decided they didn't want to check out afterall) and I  grabbed one as I headed for the checkout desk and it was this book. I think  this was the first book I ever checked out on my library card... I really  didn't care about books at the time and when I got home I read it with my  mom and turned out I loved it! I could not imagine why any kid would decide  not to check it out! It is similar to that book Alexander and the Terrible,  Horrible, No Good, Very  Bad  Day.	2000-04-29

I soon became familiar with the author when I read her book Isabelle The Itch. Although this book seemed good, I didn't get interested  in it until much later, in fact I picked up a copy last week at a thrift  store for 50 cents and I just finished reading it today.  MMM, what a  touching story. It reminds me of my childhood, growing up in the suburbs of  Seattle in a town called Lynnwood. I wanted a horse bad and me and my  sister would play horses all day and pretend to be pioneers. Then we'd sit  on the fence outside and watch the sunsets over the Olympic Mountain range;  a lot similar to the things Joss and Kate did together.  We moved up  north east of Lynnwood a few years later and I'd see this book in the  school library but I guess I sorta forgot about it until I saw and bought  it recently.  Anyway it is different from the author's story about her  character Isabelle. Isabelle is more comedy-style, whereas this book deals  with some serious fact-of-life issues we all need to face sooner or later.  So easy to take our loved ones for granted, thinking that they'll always  be with us. This book helps you to appreciate what you've got and to spend  quality time with the ones you love because you never know; it could all  just crumble any time.  Before the tragic part in the book, I found a lot  of interesting parts and some were even kind of funny. Ms. Greene uses the  right blend of comedy and tragedy. Go, Ms. Greene!	2000-04-28

I will always remember because that was the happiest grade-school year of my whole life. I was going to private school with a wonderful, sweet teacher and awesome friends.  Among all the wonderful things my teacher did with us  were some of the neat things in the classroom, some being her supply of  story books.  Naturally as an animal lover, I grabbed this book during  silent reading because I needed some reading material. Tears were streaming  down my face as I began to read of Babar's mother's death, and I had tears  of joy as some good people take Babar in.  I remember being so touched by  Babar that whenever someone would mention the word &quot;elephant&quot;,  I'd get all misty-eyed! It seems funny now but at the time it was quite a  dielemma! I was too embarrassed to tell my mom and dad why I was upset so  they were concerned!  Then my mom went on a trip to California and visited  a bunch of garage sales and found some patterns for making little felt  Babar and friends dolls.  No doubt, Babar had touched my life deep  inside. My wonderful childhood was made richer.	2000-04-28

I read it when I was 9. It came in the mail from Weekly Reader Books (my dad sent away for those for me!) Every month I got books in the mail and this was one of them. At the time I didn't know it was a series, though.<br />  A year  after reading this book I could feel for Richard &quot;Beast&quot; when I,  too, was left back (it was for circumstances beyond my control, but still!)

I was having a heart attack it was so funny!  Then Mom bought it for me and I was so happy to read it again (I was 9 then).  However, I feel that Fudge was spoiled rotten and Peter was misunderstood and unjustly blamed.  I felt like Fudge was undisciplined, too. His folks knew nothing about  discipline.  Besides, I don't like the idea that they tried to force feed  Fudge. A person's hunger will drive them to eat, and it is not necessary to  force feed a child. If they are hungry, they'll eat. I feel like Blume was  encouraging parents to do this. This &quot;clean your plate or else&quot;  mentality only encourages obesity.  Also I felt like parts in this book  weren't very realistic. There is like no way a child can swallow a turtle,  plain and simple.  In 4th grade on the first day of school my teacher told  us about what we would do during the year and she said in spring we would  go see a play in Seattle on this book, and I could not wait!  Before we  went, she read this book and we laughed so hard. She had such a way of  explaining parts in the book to us. As a suburb kid I didn't really know  what it meant to get mugged back then, but she explained.  Also, why on  earth would parents raise their kids in such a bad area of town?  That is  subjecting them to be victims.  The ending was really sad and as a kid,  devistated and horrified me!  What a devil that Fudge kid is!  Overall,  this is a very neat book, one of Blume's most innocent! But parents, read  it yourself and decide!	2000-04-05

For one thing, there were no pictureslike the previous book.  Another thing, I felt like the Fudge series lost some of it's innocense with one of Peter's friends saying blankety-blank (they didn't actually print it out but hinted it) in front of Fudge and his pals.  Peter's pal should have known better. I wouldn't recommend this book to really young readers for that reason, and it may be upsetting for some kids because of the fact that Blume gives the impression that there's no Santa.  Now when I read it, I wasn't upset because I already knew. But I think it'd upset some children, and I thought it was sad that Fudge lost his childlike innocense by not believing in Santa anymore.  So parents, I highly advise you to proof-read this book before handing it over to your kids, as with any questionable material.	2000-04-05

I think this was my second chapter book I ever read (Ramona the Pest being  the first) I got them as a box set for Christmas when I was 8 and became a  die-hard Ramona fan!  I could totally identify with the ups and downs  Ramona goes through at 7. That is sort of a borderline age. Part of her  wants to run free like toddler Willa Jean, trashing the house, while the  other half of her is expected to keep her feet on the ground. Ramona's  bright spirit set my heart free and encouraged me to enjoy being a child  running free.  Parts of this book were sad, some parts bittersweet. It is  perfect!!

However this book helps you to learn to be a good  samaritan. JP was a good samaritan by befriending Matthew, who didn't know  anyone since he was a new student; and noone liked JP and she was picked on  a lot but Matthew was a good samaritan to her!

They were cute, about the kindergarteners at Polk St School. However these characters are not very well established.  For instance, it was supposed to be a new year at Polk St, but Emily and Richard and the older kids were  still in Ms. Rooney's 2nd grade class. If you have read any of the original  Polk St books about Emily, you will notice that Stacy, Emily's little  sister, wasn't in school then, when Emily was in Ms. Rooney's room. I found  this inconsistant, but the story is well written.	2000-04-01

I think I liked every book I read as a child, but in hindsight, this one was an exception. I frankly didn't care for this one.<br />  It made me cry. Parts of it were kinda dumb but necessary.  Kids do go through a lying stage. The ending of the book left me in tears. Seemed like it ended  abruptly and didn't explain everything. I was devastated that the stray cat Lizzie took in was never found...I hope the kitty found a good home. Lizzie was too impulsive and made some bad decisions. I didn't really care for her grandmother--she griped too much about the cat--but I guess I kind of understand because having pets is a big responsability. Also Lizzie did not have any respect for her and you should respect your elders. I really didn't care for her grandmother, mother, or Lizzie. I liked her father; he seemed like a good guy. Actually Lizzie didn't deserve to have a kitty; she was a naughty girl.<br />  I wrote to the author and she wrote  back!

I remember taking this book out to recess with me cause it was so good I couldn't put it down. Then my bookmark fell out and two boys from class grabbed it and started tossing it back and forth like Yard Ape did with Ramona's eraser in Ramona Quimby, Age 8. (My teacher had read us that book and that's obviously where they picked that up!) But paper doesn't toss as well as rubber...of course I yelled &quot;Give me my bookmarker, you yucky yardapes!&quot; The playground lady came over and made them stop and then she said I should put the book away and go play.

It was pretty entertaining, and interesting. Kristy is good athandling snobs.  However, I went from one private school to the next in grade school, on and off, and 7th grade and those kids aren't always snobs. Sure they worry about dumb stuff like the cars you drive (at least the teenagers do) but not all of them are rich. It has nothing to do with wealth. Some of the kids I went to private school had maybe one pair of jeans and one pair of shoes, and a few second-hand shirts. That's it. Some of them were snobs though--the rich kids who get driven to school in Mercedes Benz.  Another thing: Kristy and her family should've kept Louie's collar.	2000-03-22

WHen I got to this one, I enjoyed it, but immediately found this one different from the others. It was the one that you realize doesn't fit in  with the series. For starters, in the others, you will notice that every  scene takes place in a school setting; playground, classroom or walking  home. In this one, we get a glimpse of Richard at home, on his way back to  school after Christmas vacation.  He starts getting harassed by school  bully, Drake. Then he finds a ruler in his desk, which seems to have  magical powers. That was the other thing: these books were supposed to be  sort of realistic fiction. Well the ruler and magic didn't fit in with that  image. However I guess all of us as kids could have at least sworn  something was magic... this book is still good, though. I liked it, it just  wasn't my favorite.	2000-03-22

Somehow I got them inside of the farm, though. I thought I could just pick  them up with my hands and one bit me &lt;ouch that hurt&gt;. It was a lot  of fun althugh I think I over fed them. We came back from a camping trip  and they were all dead. Sad. Anyway this book brought back good memories  and made me laugh out loud!	2000-03-13

Although well-written and interesting, the whole thing is stupid. WHat makes the BSC so special that they can travel the world like that?

Kristy was a baby about being jealous of them. Also how can Dawn book her own flight back to  Connecticut?  That was totally irresponsible. I liked Dawn a lot better in  the earlier BSC books. Later on she goes from friendly and kind to snotty.  She was a coward to try to run away from her problems.	2000-03-10

It shows how people who are &quot;different&quot; are really just normal, everyday people. It shows you how people of different races are special and so are disabled people. Jessi breaks the  communication barrier, and makes a new friend! I read this 10 years ago and  I still remember it!	2000-03-09

It dragged on and on and on!  The cover was attractive, though. What did Dawn have to do with the Little Miss Stoneybrook?  I wondered when I first saw the book.<br />  I thought Jeff was a spoiled rotten little brat. The parents should not have rewarded his bad attitude/behavior by giving him what he wanted: a return to California.<br />  I read this book when I was 12 or 13 and thought it was boring but read it anyways because I followed the series religiously. Back then, I was disappointed that none of the BSC charges who participated in the pagent won, and thought that the judges used very bad judgment in picking their winner, as the winner was horrible. However, in hindsight, I am glad non of their charges won; beauty pagent life is phoney, superficial, hoity-toity and very hard. I am going to read this book again and as an adult I might appreciate it more than I did at 13.	2000-03-09

It was good to see Stacey return to the BSC because the books when she was gone were dull, and because she was my favorite. However it is sad that it was in the event of her folks' divorce! Also, I was a bit irritated. I know a lot of people choose divorce, but what is all this? First Kristy's, then Dawn's, Mary Anne had no mother--Claudia was the only one from the original BSC from an unbroken home. It is sad the way these books seem to glorify divorce and make it seem okay. Her folks were wimps about it; they chose divorce as a first resort rather than last, just because they didn't want to deal with it! And I think Stacey's folks were selfish babies to fight like a pair of spoiled brats! If they cared about their daughter, they should try to work things out!	2000-03-07

It was right before I started Junior High and at first I was nervous about the thought of it, until I got into the BSC series and then I thought jr high might be lots of fun: I  dreamed of wearing cool clothes like Claudia and Stacie and meeting guys,  having dates, etc. (I admired Ann cause she was positive and didn't use  foul language and was appropriate--Still do admire her! She is a lovely  lady!) However, to make a long story short, I started jr high and wore wild  clothes like Claudia and Stacey. Yes it was pretty fun, however, until kids  started laughing at me! (In the book everyone admires the girls'  insividuality but in jr high they rejected me for trying it!) Seemed like  everyone loved Stacey and the gang. Well in jr high I was beaten up three  times by a guy and a bunch of girls, and the principal was negligent, I had  to go to court, which was a nightmare. I was stalked and harassed all my jr  high years. I could not figure out why I had so much trouble!  After all,  Claud, Kristy, Stacy and Mary ANne had a blast. It wasn't fair!	2000-03-07

Mary Anne needs to get some new friends, and that's all there is too it! I mean, please! I hated the way Dawn acted towards her, like a total brat! Eavesdropping, acting cold and unfriendly. Dawn  missed her dad so she took it out on Mary Anne, basically. Real mature!  Then she gets the other BSC-ers to give her the cold shoulder--first of  all, if She and Dawn were fighting, the others need to MIND THEIR OWN  STINKIN' BUSINESS!  What a bunch of babies. Another thing, MARY ANNE DID  NOTHING WRONG, SO WHY SHOULD SHE APOLOGIZE TO DAWN?  IT WAS DAWN'S DOING!	2000-03-07

When I was in 4th grade about 11 yrs ago every Friday all 3 4th grade classes would gather in one classroom at the end of the day and watch a movie. One Friday we saw one called &quot;Sarah &amp; The Summer Swans&quot; ( I didn't know it was a book then!) In the movie, Sarah is  this average, awkward gal with a mouth full of braces. She thinks she is  going to have a dull summer, but then her brother wanders off one night,  and that was when one of the 4th grade teachers stopped the film and told  us it was time to go home: we were out of time! I was in suspense, and  disappointed that he didn't check out the film again so we could see the  rest of it. Then 2 years later I was in the library at school and I was  bored cause I knew my library really well and had read most of the fiction  books, then I saw the book! I knew upon seeing the title and reading the  summary that this was it! It was excellent!	2000-03-06

Also Stacey was a jerk. She got mad at Claudia over nothing! Best friends  don't do that! And why does she get all the guys? Boys at that age just  aren't interested in girls yet, and yeah right, I bet she'd know someone  clear across the country!

Also it was a bit frightening about what happens when your wish comes true: not always  a good thing! Andrea  discovers this. It was kinda gross when she starts turning into a bird, and  sad when she is betrayed by her so-called &quot;best friend&quot; Lauren!   That part angered me. This book sorta reminded me of The Fly or Elephant  Man. It is very sad about how some &quot;friends&quot; betray their  friends! Although Andrea didn't have an illness like Elephant Man, she is  treated like dirt by that traitor Lauren, and Lauren, not to my knowledge,  ever did apologize. That made me mad. I guess Lauren never knew about the  wings (her brother Jim is the only one who knew), she treats Andi rudely by  making fun of her birdnest collection and telling her she looked stupid  wearing a heavy sweater (which was the only thing that could hide Andi's  wings) on a hot day. Real nice, Lauren! Andi should have ditched this  loser! We don't need any more traitors in this world! In the ending, Andi  has to decide between her family and life as a human girl, or her new  high-flying life as a bird. Sad, but necessary, and a valuable lesson on  not taking anything for granted!	2000-03-06

In this book, Katie and her parents have to rent out rooms to afford to stay in the wonderful old house they inherited from Katie's great-aunt Emily. Katie soon feels like a slave. She has to deal with messy, noisy, rude renters who boss her around. It is a touchy funny story. You will laugh out loud!

Me and my little sister used to play Mary Rose all the time--my sister was Mary Rose and I was someone else. I loved Veronica and Sachs'  other books about the gang. I wanted to read more about Veronica and Mary  Rose and I wrote the author in 1988 asking her if she was going to write  another book about the late Mary ROse and she said she didn't think she  ever would because in order for this book to work, the late Mary Rose would  have to remain a mysterious figure. It was a cool letter from Sachs;  hand-written and it included an autographed picture bookmark and her home  address in San Francisco on the envelope! She says that it is really up to  the reader to decide whether or not the late Mary Rose was a hero. THis  book was different from the others in the series in that it takes place  nearly three decades after the others, and this book deals with a serious  tragedy thirty years before, which traumatized the family. A good book,  albeit sad.	1999-12-13

It's about Peter who makes friends with Veronica who is an aggressive yet awkward tomboy who is shy around Peter's other friends and they dislike her because of her reputation as the former school bully.  Peter's mom, who is a goofy, shallow woman if you ask me, dislikes Veronica  and wants to terminate the friendship and Peter argues with her for months,  and he wants to invite her to his special party but his mom refuses to let  Veronica come, so he is going to keep fighting until she says yes. This  book is full of surprises and very enjoyable. You might find some parts to  sort of drag on, as I did when I first read it when I was 10, but they  become more interesting upon second and third time reading it. This book  will challenge you to consider what you look for and value in a friend.  Read it!	1999-12-12

Poor Cliffie, his folks get divorced, his teeth start sticking out and his father is trying to save up money to get him in braces. My folks weren't divorced and my teeth didn't stick out but at 10  years old I felt like i still had so many problems! My nose was too big, I  was a klutz, etc, and I admired Cliffie for acting tough and gutting it  out. His tough front caused others, however, to think he was stuck up.  Cliffie ends up losing all his friends because he shoots his mouth off  while trying to act tough. He also hands in the wrong homework, and tries  to hide from his teacher, who is an old bat! There were parts in this book,  like all other of Giff's wonderful books, that sent me into a fit of  giggles! When Cliffie rescues an abandoned, homeless starving orange cat,  he reveals to the reader that he is truely a softhearted, kind and  sensitive boy deep down. When he thinks he finds the owner of the cat, you  learn that he is also an honest person inside. This book is a must-read! I  did it for a book report speech when I was a junior in highschool.

Matthew doesn't want to go and Richard fixes up a place for Matthew to live in his garage. It's a good book with a non-saccarine ending. There are a lot of good messages to the readers, such as it is okay to cry. That's the best advice! I think I cried when I read this about Richard's best buddy Matthew moving away and although it seems an un-satisfying ending to this book, be sure to check out the other Polk Street books, and there are two books about Matthew's adventures in his new town, Deposit, Ohio (\\"Matthew Jackson Meets The Wall\\" and \\"Shark In School\\"--both delightful!)

The chapters alternate between both Amy and Laura's point of view. Amy and Laura may be sisters, but they are as different as night and day.  Laura is heavy-set, shy and awkward, and Amy is scrawny, gregarious and  outgoing. Laura is smart and Amy is, well, a lazy scholar. Laura has always  protected Amy from bullies, and done her homework for her.  I first read  this book when I was 11. I had seen it in my friend's hands in 3rd grade  when i was 8 and was interested, checked it out later but didn't really get  into it. One day I was in a used bookstore with my mom and she handed me a  book called &quot;Amy Moves In&quot; and I recognized the name and the  picture of the frizzy-haired girl on the cover, and the author's name,  Marilyn Sachs. And my name is Amy, too. My mom remembered me reading Amy  &amp; Laura, so I started that series. Later I bought this one at Dalton  Books and really enjoyed it. Amy has a mean teacher and Laure takes up a  bicycling interest and becomes hall monitor, and is too busy to help Amy  with her assignments. Both sisters discover new things about each other and  themselves, and the ending has lots of surprises; I only wish Sachs would  continue this series. It is so good.	1999-12-12

Andrea reads a comic book that she thinks is just horrible about parents rejecting their kid because he changes. It is a tragic story (the comic  book) and it sort of leaves a deep impression on her. She doesn't know how  anyone can be so horrible. THen she sees the order form for  &quot;Mail-Order Wings&quot; and she has to have them! When they arrive she  assembles them and has to glue them on. The message is to be careful what  you pray for because it just might come true and if it does, that could be  the worst thing that's ever happened to you. At first Andrea is on the top  of the world as she soars out her bedroom window into the night sky. But  then frightening things begin to happen. She begins to isolate herself from  family and friends--her friends think she's strange. If you ask me, her  &quot;best friend&quot; Lauren was a loser anyway. Andrea never felt so  alone. Then she notices she is turning into a bird!  What is she to do?	1999-12-12

Along with the progression of technology, Rose is becoming a young lady and is in transition. MacBride clearly illustrates Laura's feelings about the  old west and how she feels about the changing times. I was almost wailing  as I read about Pa breathing his last dying breaths. It is interesting to note that his last words--\\"Look, Caroline, how Laura's eyes are shining.\\"--were also the closing words he uses and the last words in the book On The Banks of Plum Creek, when Laura is a little girl. Interesting and heart wrenching. Pa worked hard all his  life on the wild prairie. He founded the town of DeSmet. He was a soldier  of the soil as well as a carpenter. It was so inspiring the way MacBride  wrote about Laura and Pa. There are a lot of interesting things happening  in this story, too. I wanted to cry through Laura's whole visit to the Dakotas. It is not only sad about Pa dying, but also sad to learn that Laura's school chum, Cap Garland, had also died years before.<br /> Rose learns who her real friends are as well as who her  pretend friends are, too, and she learns that just because the town girls  are rich doesn't mean that they are happy or have a happy family. She  learns, as Laura did when she was young, that she is fortunate to have a  happy family.<br />  The thing I don't like about this book is that Rose seems so flippant and she does not seem to be at all upset about Pa's dying. At least the book doesn't say much on Rose's thoughts about it or Almanzo's, either, for that matter. Also in her recollections of him in another book, she barely remembers him. This disturbs me! Laura was so close to him how could Rose not be? Pa was such a loving, jovial man, how could he NOT have a relationship with Rose as well?!? Everybody loved Pa! When Laura and Manley were ill, Rose lived with her grandparents, Ma & Pa Ingalls, how could she not have a relationship with them?!? It is sad...I don't care for Rose as much as I do Laura.<br />  I also didn't like Rose's attitude towards education; it was very arrogant. Just because she was ahead of her class in their lessons, she acts conceited like she thinks she is too good for them.<br />  Otherwise, it is very interesting reading about her adventures with the traveling salesman and also Miss Sarah's fling with the gambling man.

In 1987 and '88 the BSC was everywhere and at school in 5th grade I worked in the library as an assistant and I got to look at all the books coming  in. Since the age of 8 books have been my passion. Anyway, I'd clean the  books that came back in and put the cards back in and this book looked good  to me. This was before they updated some of the pictures and covers on the  BSC books, and the picture on the cover caught my eye. Stacey had  sunglasses perched on her head and a flashy shirt on. She looked like the  actress Tina Yothers from the sitcom Family Ties. I bought the book in the  bookstore and read it and enjoyed it. People often told me I looked like  the girl on Family Ties, and so I thought I must look like Stacey. I used  to dress like her and everything and my mom made me these snazzy  sweatshirts and blouses like the kind you see Claudia and Stacey wearing,  and I bought cool earrings, and different colored leggings and tennis  shoes. That was the 80's. Funny how the stuff we wore back then seems nerdy  now! P.S. When I read about how the Baby Sitters Agency's undercover agents  posing as new BSC members stood up the BSC's clients and made them look  bad, I felt like knocking those snots out of their socks!	1999-10-23

I read this when I was a kid and to this day I still enjoy these books. There are parts in these books that make me laugh. It's neat the way Dawn and Jason (who is a RIOT of a character--you'll love him) work together.  Dawn put on her disguise and sets out to look for her friend Emily's lost  ring. She wears her cowboy boots--yes, very good disguise! Very  inconspicuous, right? NOT! O-well, she's just a kid. I remember doing dumb  things like one time me and my sister and one of her friends decided we  were going to go let some neighborhood boys have it since they always threw  rocks at us. Well we loaded up our wagon and they got in and I pulled it  over there and we attacked the boys with buckets of mud we'd put together!  They started to chase us and I tried to run with the wagon and they tipped  it over and what a disaster! We were so prepared for battle!	1999-10-16

In summer 1985 I was with my family on vacation on the Washinton State Coast staying in a cabin in Grays Harbor area, and Mom would go garage sale-ing during the day. She bought  this book for 10c and I knew I was going to like it. The inside title page  showed Katie on her bike and she reminded me of Beverly Cleary's Ellen  Tebbits. I fell in love with Katie that summer day. The book is so good and  Katie is so much like me.  I found the part where she and Edwin find the old abandoned farmhouse out at Wildcat Glen VERY VERY interesting. I just wish Katie John would have asked around to find out the truth about the family that once lived there and that they explained it in the story. EVERYONE, READ KATIE JOHN!

Although it is hard to get into initially and the beginning sort of dragged on (my friend Amber loaned it to me when we were in 5th grade and I don't  think I got past chapter 1. I had never read BSC books until then so I  didn't find the intro. boring, however. I think that the BSC is too  judgemental towards each other. They think Mary Anne is immature but she  was the one who wanted reconciliation after their dumb fight, and Kristy  was the most difficult. Talk about immature! Also it was unprofessional the  way they refuse to at least meet for the club and not function. Mary anne  was the mature one in that respect.	1999-10-14

Laine is an egocentric, manipulative, selfish, snobby, bitchy, bossy old  cow. I didn't know why anyone hung out with her. SHe was an annoying  character and totally obnoxious. WHen Stacey was sick with diabetes she did  her like dirt! Anyway I cringed when Laine tells Stacey of her love  interest in NY. He was a DORK! Laine was someone who is out to impress the  Joneses.

My favorite part is when Logan instigates a food fight which gets the whole boys' mess hall started! It was such a RIOT I laughed myself silly! I was 13 when it came  out. I think that Mal and Jessi were kind of dull in this one and that they  should have just let them be regular campers. WHo ever heard of JR. CITS? A  CIT is as low as you can go, and if two people decide they can be CITS  while they're underage then other people will feel it isn't fair and they  will want to be CITs too. Also I felt like this book looked down on girls,  since it seemed like the boy's side got all the luxaries while the girls  side roughed it. WHat makes those boys so qualified anyway? Also it seemed  a ridiculous extravagance for one whole half of the lake to consist of boys  on one side and girls on the other. When i went to camp it was separated by  units and boys and girls were separated that way. Also, the camp did not  even take up all the lake, it was just another plot of land on a lake with  houses on the other side. In this book, either it's a pretty big camp, or a  teenie tiny lake. Also, it seems pretty spendy the way they have to wear  uniforms. THat is kinda dumb. WHy? But don't let these gripes get in your  way of enjoying the good parts!	1999-10-14

It reminded me of when me and my family always went to Westport on the Washington state coast every summer because Sea City reminds me a lot of Westport. I read this when I was 12 (I'm 23 now)and  still enjoy re-reading it. It's funny. I was 11 when the BSC first came out  and I watched everyone go crazy over those books and my younger cousin was  bonkers over them (she's 6 yrs younger than me) and she was even crazier  about the BSC than I. She got them by mail every week, was in the fan club,  got the newsletters and other goodies like bsc mirrors, purses, you name  it. And I still enjoy those books and now she's moved on to Goosebumps and  Stephen King. Kinda sad, some kids i feel like they grow up too fast.  Anyway, about this book, I could identify with Stacey and her broken heart.  It was very entertaining and the Pike kids are some well-established  characters. Anyway when I was 12 and I read the part where she meets Toby  and describes his looks and \\"cool\\" clothes, I thought that I'd  melt if i met him cause he sounded so cute. Now he sounds like a dork! But  it is such a good book!<br />  About Stacey's diabetes, I am not diabetic, but I am a little familiar with the condition. And I don't think Stacey has anything to be ashamed about, which is why I find it odd and unrealistic that her NY friends persecute her for it, and she feels she needs to be all secretive about her chronic illness. Do people normally get persecuted for diabetes? Of course, I, too, suffer from a chronic illness which at one time caused me to miss excessive work days, and my co-workers apparently thought I was a hypochondriac and talked behind my back in my absence...so, could be! I just think that as a young teen, there are other issues such as puberty, etc., which would be more embarrassing and personal than diabetes.	1999-10-14

I went out and bought it just in time for summer vacation and  took it with me to read when I went with my family to the Oregon Coast. It  was very appropriate reading material for that environment. It was so good,  and I enjoyed it except that I feel like there was too much 'romance' in  it. And that seemed to make it dull.

It wasn't very deep, and I found the part about Hurricane Bill very dull. Besides, why on earth would  Logan want to hang out with a pack of girls in Sea City? He had no business  there unless his buddies were going. Also I don't think boys should be  baby-sitters. I'm not prejudiced, I just know that things get out of hand  when theres a boy baby-sitter. Remember the thing with Michael Jackson?  I  was kinda glad that Stacey ditched Toby, who turned out to be a bad apple  when he ditched her in Mary Anne &amp; too many Boys.

I always felt like I was Stacey ever since 1988 when I was 12. We looked alike and like clothes and shopping. Anyway I could identify with what she was feeling although sometimes I felt like she  was a snob and went overboard being to embarrassed by her BSC friends's  behavior. Sure, Kristy's behavior was totally inappropriate and if I was  Stacey I would have reacted the same way. And Dawn was rude. I didn't  really care for Stacey's new group of friends; they seemed dull.

Also, she gets to go visit her father who lives in sunny  California (her folks are divorced). THe thing I hate though is that I  think Veronica's mother is a materialistic snob who spends too much money  on herself and neglects her daughter, and tries to get her to eat carrot  sticks. That seems like it gives lip service to the diet world that says  you have to look like a stick! also Veronica's mother makes her daughter  call her by her first name because she thinks it makes her feel younger.  Does that mean she regrets having kids? THat irritated me. But this book is  still cool that part just made me mad.	1999-10-08

Sisters Amy and Laura, following a terrible accident and a family emergency, wind up at  summer camp (for like, ALL SUMMER! 8 weeks! WHOOA! Good Lord: what a  nightmare!) I had a sad camping experience as a kid and like Laura, i was a  quiet bookworm who was close to my folks and hated summer camp. It freaked  me out to think of being sent to camp for that long since i could not even  handle 1 week when i went!  I read this book at age 11 when my social life  spun out of control. I became very insecure about a lot of things and could  relate to Laura. However, i think Laura was, well, sort of a crybaby. I  didn't like the way she was always down on herself (then again, i guess i  did the same thing to myself at that age) and i didn't like the way she  complained about her braces; I mean, she should be thankful for what she's  got. Braces are expensive and I wanted them bad at her age and was happy to  get them; they are worth the money and pain. Also, my dad says when he was  a kid in the 1940's they didn't normally put braces on kids. I think Laura  should have considered herself lucky that she was on the way to having  straight pretty teeth and not gripe about it, but I guess braces in the  40's were retched-looking compared to now so I don't know. There are a few  parts in this book that irritated me. I thought that Laura and her other  bunkmates let that chick Betty (an annoying character) push them around too  much. I would'nt have. But it shows you how peer pressure works among kids,  and all in all it's a neat book and I really would'nt change a thing about  it, and in the end the author ties up all the loose ends and Laura is a  more confident young lady who made a true friend, Anne, and some other  friends. Interesting thing to note: the Apple Paperback copies of these  books have no illustrations but when I was in grade school the school  library carried hardback copies of the three Amy and Laura books and they  were illustrated!the school  library carried hardback copies of the three Amy and Laura books and they  were illustrated!	1999-10-02
US	51377069	R12WT1TQPT6DPH	0844668966	169740626	Veronica Ganz	Books	5	12	14	N	N	Cool book!	I read this as an insecure fourth grader. Like Veronica, I was clumsy and bigger than everyone else, so I was teased a lot. I admired Veronica and the way she never let anyone push her around. Kids were really wild growing  up, and I wanted to be like Veronica; brave and strong, taking no guff from  anyone! I thought it was cool the way the author attempts to show that  women/girls aren't the weaker sex. All my life people told me that men are  better than women, etc., and this book settled the score! Now when I think  about it, it is a bit unusual for a bully to be female; usually female  bullies might have been victims of abuse or something. Veronica comes from  a broken home and she and her sister Mary Rose Ganz are from her mother's  first marriage. In the 1940's when this story took place, divorce was  unusual. Anyway Veronica lives with her mother, sister, and her stepfather  and half brother Stanley, and Veronica feels like she has to stand up for  herself and her family. It seems like their real dad is distant; they  haven't seen him since they were babies, and all he does is send letters  and money. And he apparently has always been breaking their hearts by  saying that he's coming to visit and then cancelling at the last minute,  anyway, Veronica says she couldn't care less but i think deep down it hurts  her, and her sister is always crying and devistated over their father not  coming. I think that's the cause of VEronica's behavior towards others, and  i think she has a lot of anger inside. She gets irritate easily, and  usually when she lets people have it, she is successful, until Peter moves  to town, and he gives her heck and she chases him for months. It is neat  the way the story ends, and I don't want to tell it and spoil it for  anyone, but anyway another comment i have is that although i appreciate the  way this book stands up for the female gender, i think it went a little  overboard in that it sort of put men down by making them seem like wimps. I  guess Veronica had a lot of problems being lonely and insecure and not  having a father in the home, even though her stepfather was a nice guy.  WHat bothered me was the way Veronica was always complaining about her  stepfather and her mother always screamed at him. However,it was a totally  awesome book and the author is cool and she has a point in all this!s.

I, too, was also a big klutz in PE and i  was so shy and afraid of bringing attention to myself that i'd hide in the  bathroom just like Fran Ellen did. I however think that when those girls  bullied her she should have stood up for herself more. I would have, i  think. However they did pressure her a lot but i would not have given in  like she did. It was cool the way in the end the teacher stands up for her  as she notices Fran Ellen is improving a lot. The ending was sort of a  cliff hanger, however, but one of my fave things about this book is Louis  Glansman's illustrations! I had checked it out at the library and could not  get enough of his pen and ink pictures--they are so real! The library kept  reminding me to return the book and i could not get enough of the  illustrations! CHECK IT OUT!!!	1999-10-02

I have been a Casey Valentine & friends fan since I was 10 and had devoured all the other books and was thirsty for more, and had been writing to the author on and  off when I was a kid and she mentioned this book in her letter to me and so  years later I finally found it in the library. I loved it! It is so good!  It's about a chubby girl named Poopsie who wants to change her image, and  her friend Tracy (some friend!) always puts her down and calls her a  \\"Lily Liver\\". She wants ballet lessons and she gets her wish when  her mom takes a job waitressing but the catch is that Poopsie will be home  alone in the evenings while her mom works and she put Poopsie in charge on  her baby brother Teddy. Thing is, Poopsie is scared since Tracy told her  that a kidnapper is in the neighborhood. Poopsie gets tired of Tracy always  teasing her so when her ballet class does a musical, Poopsie lies to her  about her role in it, and then Tracy becomes impressed and decides she's  going to come watch her perform...Poopsie's got herself in a jam! It's a  funny book that will make you laugh out loud! Only thing though is they did not really explain what happened with Tracy's \\"kidnapper\\" story; it did turn out to be Richard and Leroy hanging out at Gypsy Wild, the cabin where Tracy claimed the kidnapper was hiding out, but how do you account for Tracy's story about her dad going to check the place out previously and Poopsie's mom being scared and telling her to stay away from that place?	1999-10-02

I have been a Katie fan since I was 9 and when I was 13 I found this book in the library and was so glad! I could identify with what Katie went thru as she begins Junior High and makes some mature changes. She begins to  notice boys and then she has to choose which one is her Heathcliff! I just wish that this book had illustrations like the previous 3 and that the author wrote more Katie John books. I STILL MISS HER!!! Also I did not like the character Trisha, she was a snob and a jerk. Also I was very disappointed in her attitude and in Jason's as well. They were very rude to Katie when she has them over especially since SHE INVITED THEM. They acted like snobby low class jerks. I was especially surprised in Jason's behavior, as he had shown an interest in Katie John then he sees her house and just because it wasn't a country club house like Trish's, he and her act RUDE. BOOO! It is so good but I like the first 3 books better.	1999-10-02

I could really relate to Veronica in that i was lonely and wanted people to like me, and i thought it was cool the way she wasn't afraid to stand up for what she believes in.  This book covers a lot of things that young kids go thru growing up. It's a  must-have!	1999-10-02

My mom got it for me as a birthday present and I loved it. I felt like Casey was a lot like me in that I wanted to make a name for myself. When I started fourth grade my popularity was  decreased and I felt like nobody recognized me. Unlike Casey, I did not get  the opportunity to run for class pres, or anything. But Casey was someone I  looked up to and could identify with. She gets herself into all sorts of  jams in this book and has such an imagination!	1999-10-02

The story supposedly takes place in the 1940's but things such as kids haven't changed all that much! It really focuses in on the lives of young kids; It talks about an ordinary closeknit  family; Mama, Daddy, and their two girls Laura (oldest) and Amy (youngest). The fact that they are poor, Jewish and living in a different time period and a different area from where I grew up (them in the  inner city outside NYC, me in the suburbs clear across the nation outside Seattle) from mine didn't really strike me initially. I grew up in a comfortable family in the upper middle class in the 1980s, but the story still could have been my own. It is timeless and could have happened anywhere at any time. They just moved to a new neighborhood and Amy has mixed feelings and gets  into all kinds of adventures. Things that bothered me were that I thought  that Amy was sort of a wimp and cried too much and her sister and mother  should have had her fight her own battles since Laura can't always be there  to do it for her. Also, I think Amy gives in too easily to friends and she  initially has a bad choice in friendships, her standards are too low,  however that evens out in the end. Also, I could not believe how rude the  storekeepers were in the story; talk about bad customer service. How can  they stay in business if they yell at people??? I guess they were very low class, so that was life in  the Bronx back then! I was also hacked off about the way one chapter it  made girls seem inferior to boys and seemed to let boys get away with  hurting girls and there seemed to be no closure to it. However I guess in a  latter chapter they vaguely mention a settlement about the boy-girl dispute  in the girls' favor but it isn't quite clear.  Anyway, their ordinary  family life is disrupted when Mama has a terrible accident and winds up in  the hospital. Daddy's sister Aunt Minnie comes to live with them (she's a  screamer and she's a neat freak!) and Mama's one night stay in the hospital  turns into months. I did not always care for Aunt Minnie, how she hated animals. She was a cruel heartless witch! I cried about the Kitten Herkey. He was just a helpless kitten, for Heaven's sake and Aunt Minnie was so irrational about it. It was not his fault he was a helpless kitty. She could have at least given him to someone else who would care for him. You don't take a pet away from children; that is a cardinal rule! AUNT MINNIE, HAVE A HEART, for crying out loud!!! Money was clearly not the issue, or Daddy would not have brought the kitten home in the first place. It's HIS house. Aunt Minnie was just plain MEAN!<br />The end of the book was disappointing in that it left a  lot of questions unanswered, however it's a series and if you read the two  following books you get more answers. This is an interesting book and you  kind of have to read it more than once in order to understand it better and  to enjoy it more.es to live with them (she's a  screamer and she's a neat freak!) and Mama's one night stay in the hospital  turns into months.
