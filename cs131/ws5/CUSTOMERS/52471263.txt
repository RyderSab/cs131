After spending literally thousands of dollars on courses, learning cd's, Macromedia Studio, etc... I was in a local book store and started thumbing through it.  The simplicity of FLASH flashed through my mind.  I finally got it.  Everything clicked. <br /> <br />I bought the book, brought it home, read the entire book with lessons over the next three days, and viola- I could do professional design (or at least I feel I could).   <br /> <br />Seriously, it is very easy to read.  It is not buried in jargon, but instead uses read examples in a step by step tutorial like setting where you play with the program and get comfortable with the environment.   <br /> <br />I seriously loved this book, and couldn't recommend and on Flash ahead of it... but don't take my word.  Go to a local book store and thumb through it yourself.  GOOD LUCK!	2005-02-05

I have been working as a director for some time, so I know how to design the elements of a frame.  I am therefore unbelievably surprised at how much this book taught me about designing the elements on the page. <br /> <br />This is obviously an introductary book (read the title), but what a value of a book it is.  I've wasted hundreds of dollars on design... yet this book keeps everything so simple that I can actually translate it to use.  Highly recommend.	2005-02-04

The first two sections are fantastic as it takes us through the story of Gipo, a man haunted by informing on his best friend.  O'Flaherty does a fantastic job of painting the scene of poverty in Dublin that would lead to someone informing on their buddy... and then we have the pleasure of watching him use the blood money.  If it ended on page 120, I would definitely give the book 5 stars.<br />The last 60 pages are very boring and drawn out.  Whereas the story could have been a fascinating tell of the above mentioned material, the last is so obvious, that it is physically painful waiting for the conclusion.  <br />All in all, the book is a great study in the darker side of human behavior.  I am glad that I read it for that reason.  However, the climax leaves a lot to be desired.	2003-08-04

I listened to the rave reviews on here by people about this book, and decided that it sounded interesting.  Boy was I wrong!!!<br />I first had interest in this book because of the cover.  It seemed exciting, and I had read Jaivin's other book \\"Eat Me\\" on the basis of a recommendation (it wasn't great either, but much better than this).  People talk about how kinky, sexy, seductive, etc. the book is --- well it wasn't!!!  It seems that phrases like \\"Want to suck my *&(*\\", or the use of the four letter \\"C\\" or \\"F\\" words have been reviewed as witty and sexy.  While this may sustain a few pages of anticipation - the experience never lived up to anything sexy in nature.  I'd love to hear the \\"C\\" word if used as steamy as in \\"Lady Chatterly's Lover\\".  In this book it was just obnoxious.  <br />Basically, this is the story of three aliens that speak the equivalent of \\"Grunge Ebonics\\" that steal a spaceship to go to earth.  They abduct a guy with dreadlocks in Australia named Jake, and then we spend the rest of the book exploring the relationship (or lack thereof) between the hot alien \\"Baby\\" and slacker Jake.  As I'm writing this, I can't help but think how interesting this book sounds... and perhaps that is the problem.  IT DOESN'T DELIVER on what could have been a very enjoyable premise.<br />Honestly, I turned to my wife and said on page 30 \\"This is horrible.\\"  I turned to her again on page 110 and said, \\"This may be the worst book I've ever read in my life.\\"  One week later, when I was still struggling to finish it, she asked, \\"Why don't you just put it down.\\"  My reply was that I truly could not believe it was as bad as it was - and I was waiting for it to get better.  I can honestly tell you that as I read the last paragraph, I was filled with rage at the realization that I had in fact been duped.  To paraphrase Jaivin's writing style in this book \\"It's like the biggest piece of ....-o-rama ever!!! As if!!!\\"  Don't waste your money, or more importantly, your time.	2003-07-14

As with the other books, I found the book entirely delightful as well as a very quick read.  As in any collection of short stories, some are better than others, but there are at least three classics that make the purchase worthwhile regardless of how you feel about the others.  <br />In this book Woody Allen keeps the one-liners coming at such a pace that I cannot believe anyone could be so witty.  His writing is always filled with puns and intentional misdirection that keep the reader actively involved in the book.  I found myself reading the stories straight though, and finished the book in two sittings, though each story is short enough to read on the fly when you have some extra time.<br />If you are a fan of Woody Allen, then this book is another in your obligation to get more Woody.  If you don't like his movies, then you will likely not like this book, as his idiosyncratic mannerisms come across in the writing.	2003-07-09

In order to appropriately recommend it for you, however, I need to break it down into categories... as it has different strengths depending on your needs.<br />From the standpoint of an enjoyable look into one of the top screenplay writers in Hollywood, I would give it a 5 out of 5.  I found myself creating time that I didn't have to keep reading it because I wanted to hear inside stories from the point of view of a professional writer working with stars such as Newman, Redford, etc.  It was both funny and  charming to hear war stories ranging from catastrophes to simply magical occurrences.<br />From the point of view of a would be filmmaker using this book as a resource, I can only give it a 3.  I would still recommend it to read, but not for pearls of wisdom.  There are some helpful insights, but, like many books on the entertainment industry, it is filled with more \\"war stories\\" than hard advice.  <br />There is one section that is interesting, though daunting.  He breaks down a short story that he wrote into a screenplay, then gets top players in the industry to discuss their relevant roles (production designer, D.P., director, etc).  It is very enlightening to hear their responses to the material and what they view the strength of it is.  <br />Finally, there is another pearl to be gleamed from Goldman's book... and that is why movies are getting to be such cookie cutter pictures (and that was written in the 1980's... what would he think today?).  He specifically shows that a lot has to do with needing to write parts that will attract stars.  This is very helpful, and a true lesson, though I would guess most non professional screenwriters will blow it off.<br />Overall, a fantastic read but just better than average textbook.  Happy reading!	2003-05-07

Have you ever watched a movie or play, and at the end of it you say, &quot;I don't get it&quot;? ---&gt; But everyone around you says it was the greatest thing they have ever seen... well, I will not pretend to be a pseudo-intellectual.  Ibsen was way over my head with this book.<br />Superficially the book was extremely interesting from the standpoint of: will one man be willing to stand up to a city when he knows what is right?  In our story, the protagonist has discovered that the Norwegian baths are filled with a poisonous organism.  However, when he voices this, the entire town goes against him because it will cost them economically, and they put the pressure on him to refute that which he knows is correct.  From that standpoint - the book is excellent... and we are held to find the outcome.<br />Where it lost me personally was when Ibsen went on his political diatribe.  He further alienated me via his pages of discussion on liberalism in a manner that seemed conservative to me.  Nevertheless, I enjoyed these speeches as well, and they admittedly felt more contemporary Republican than Liberal Democrat.<br />In the end, I would have to recommend this book, but say \\"Feel free to not understand.\\"  It is okay to embrace that not everything is clear, and at times his points are lost on minds as dull as mine.  Embrace your ignorance, and enjoy it for what it is	2003-04-15

However, I still enjoyed it and am glad I read it.  Here is why:<br />This novella is a very dark treatment of sexual relations and how difficult it is to surrender oneself to a single relationship of fidelity.  The major characters are Kay and Benjamin, who go though their relationship that cannot exist.  Why?  Because Benjamin is engaged to another woman, Vanessa, that he really loves.<br />Where this book is successful is in exploring the \\"second guessings\\" that come with people knowing they are bad for each other... but still craving each others flesh.  Minot's writing leaves no question that the characters are connected in a type of love... just not the kind that can go anywhere.  Thus, it is an intensely frustrating experience trying to follow them through the encounter that is the backdrop to the story ---> a session of oral sex that will most likely be their last.<br />Where this story failed for me, is that it seemed to short-schrift the sexual tension.  I have never been so unimpressed with a b.j. in my life... yet that is the premise of what the characters \\"rapture\\" is.  Thus, it sets up a sexuality that is never delivered on, and has a very dark take on relationships.  <br />Again, I certainly understand why people were disappointed... yet I did enjoy it, and would recommend it to those prone to helplessness and dark stories.	2003-03-31

Wow!<br />This book is extremely interesting to read as it is a series of letters and essays from Stanislavski to his contemporaries.  It was unbelievably humorous to listen to his discussion of Chekhov and imagine trying to conduct rehearsals with him sitting there watching.<br />This book is broken into 5 major sections with different themes of Stanislavski's life explored in each one.  Thespians will find his words inspiring, historians will find his words enlightening, and a normal person will find themselves better informed of the world of theater and what goes into preparing.<br />I highly recommend this book.	2002-07-02

Id like to focus on the positive and say that any fan of Mamet should definitely buy this book.  It is a quick read and a pleasure (mostly).<br />On the positive side, the book consists of 24 short essays, of which a few are among the most wonderful that I have ever read.  Of particular interest was a story about gambling in Chicago.  It is worded so beautifully, that the reader aches when it finishes.  Another story is about his days as a copy editor on a pornographic magazine that is rather entertaining.  Finally, there is an essay that all would-be writers will love called The Diner that discusses the craft of writing in relation to where one writes  as well as a number of takes on screenwriting, etc.  Ive left out a ton of great essays out, but this at least gives a window into the breadth that this book covers.<br />On the offensive side, I too am a Jew.  However, Mamet becomes so Us v. the Christian them in some of the stories that I was actually turned off to him as a person.  One essay criticizes Shindlers List as being a terrible movie as if Mamet has ever written or directed anything as powerful.  In another, he talks on the subject of minority rights in such a way that I want to slap him upside the head and tell him to quit his whiney driveling.  Finally, in the wake of September 11th, his criticism of the government and their military actions were enough to cause me to put the book down.  <br />As is always the risk in personal essays, some make me value Mamet as a talented writer, and some make me want to see his career come to a bitter end.  The only way you too can judge is to buy this book and read it.  At the end of the day, Im happy I went on the journey but wanted to warn you all about some of the sights.	2002-06-24

It is a short book collection of 17 of the funniest essays that Woody Allen has ever written.  I found myself laughing out loud all over the place, and actually finished this book in two brief settings.  I generally like to read 1-2 essays a day, but with each one, I wanted more.<br />Death Knocks is one of the essays in this book that really got me going.  It was so damn funny.  It felt like a funny version of Ingmar Bergman's Seventh Seal... where the person meant to die will not allow Death to take him.  I loved it.  A Look at Organized Crime was another absolutely hilarious essay written as you can imagine.  <br />Finally The Gossage-Vardebedian Papers has got to be one of the funniest essays ever penned.  It is the exchange of letters between two chess players as they try to make sense of a game that they are having through the mail.  I'm telling you, my gut was bursting.  <br />This is a great place to get started when reading Woody Allen novels.  There are no plays contained within as are in his book Without Feathers, but the essays are of a much higher caliber.  I know you are going to love this one.  Happy reading!	2002-06-24

Interestingly, the breadth of essays contained in this book are a lot like his movies... there are great ones, there are good ones, and there are bad ones.  I would say that this classifies the 18 different essays contained within this book to a tee with most of them landing in the \\"good\\" category.  I've read all of his books, and I would say the most classic Woody Allen essay's are in Getting Even.  I would recommend that anyone interested in reading a Allen book go there first, and then come to this one if they like it (plus it is in chronological order that way).<br />Perhaps the best thing about this book was not the essays but rather the two plays that were contained within.  The play Death is hilarious, and ultimately was made into one of Woody Allen's films.  This play gives an insight into how he writes primarily dialogue and very little description.  Additionally, the play God was also very funny.  The purchase is worth it to see the contrast between how Allen writes essays versus how he writes screenplays.  The essays were good (not all that laugh out loud funny), but the plays were excellent.	2002-06-24

This is particularly disappointing given that their German Series is perfect.<br />The first 1/4 of the book is devoted to the minutia of vowel sounds.  It has no examples to speak of, and the tape that accompanies this book actually uses wrong answers intentionally!!! Thus, if you play the tape in your car without benefit of having the book with you, you will actually have incorrect examples played over and over.  This obviously leads to confusion.<br />Again, I've used the German, French, and Spanish versions of this series.  The Spanish is also disappointing, but the Italian is so horrible that even it looks great.<br />If you buy this, you are libel to frustrate yourself and actually run the risk of losing interest in Italian.<br />Sorry, I wish the news were better.	2002-05-11

The strength of this book is that Richard Bare tells a lot of very entertaining stories that he or other directors have had to face.  In doing so, he engages the reader and invites us on his personal journey through his career in making motion pictures.  In particular, his stories about Spielberg &amp; Lucas are engaging.  Also, I think that the chapter on the two different forms of acting was particularly good.  <br />The weakness of this book is that it is more a collection of \\"war stories\\" applied to chapters that are supposed to be instructive.  In other words, he has chapters including: \\"Camera as a directors tool\\", \\"working with a film editor\\", \\"creating a job for yourself\\", etc... however, these chapters are not particularly insightful in teaching one about the topic.  Part of this is the result of being laid out in what feels like a random order, instead of each chapter building on the previous one.  Additionally, the book gets bogged down in that it tries to cover so much that it is only successful superficially.  <br />Again, I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book.  Thus, I would highly recommend it as a read to anyone that is seeking pleasure.  However, if you are after the true \\"directors\\" insight... I would refer you to \\"Making Movies\\" by Sidney Lumet.  \\"The Film Director\\" is to \\"Making Movies\\" as \\"Mobsters\\" is to \\"The Godfather\\".	2002-01-28

If a person wants to read a bunch of stories of what happened... then this is a good choice.  If, however, you wish to read about marketing your movie by &quot;opening the picture and giving it legs&quot;... you would get more value from reading the gossip column of the National Enquirer.<br />The book is broken down into &quot;case studies&quot; as follows:  Romantic Comedy, American Independent Films, Action-adventure, Documentary, Foreign Films, Low Budget &amp; B-movies, Suspense Thriller, Black, and then a section on making trialers &amp; promotions.  The first three chapters seemed to get off to at least an interesting start as the interviewees discussed &quot;Four Weddings and a Funeral&quot;, &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; and &quot;Golden-eye.&quot;  However, it takes a nose dive thereafter.<br />The chapter on GoldenEye discusses the BMW tie in, and as such was informative.  Also, the discussion surrounding &quot;Four Weddings&quot; was such that they gave insight into building a campaign.<br />Why does it hit a brick wall you ask?  The author literally starts quoting people's comments on what should have been done... and does nothing to craft arguments or illustrations that would have improved the readers understanding.  For example, he talks about Spike Lee, John Singleton, and the Hughes brothers in terms of their marketability in the Black Film section, but then provides absolutely no examples of how these filmmakers projects are marketed, nor what sorts of special approaches one might consider.<br />Overall, I rarely try to slam a book.  Nevertheless, this book was complete garbage and hours of my life that I will never get back.  If I didn't have a strict rule of always finishing a book once I start it, I would have set it down by page 50 of 273.  Trust me... read the trades or use your ownpowers of observation, because this book will not help you beyond that advice.	2001-12-30

I went home, opened it up, and found I could not put it down.  It is thoroughly entertaining, and reads more like fiction than autobiography.<br />The book covers the life of crime of Frank Abagnale, Jr.  AKA about 10 different people involved in outrageous stings ranging from acting as Pan Am captain to pediatrician.  It shows just how easy crime could be if someone were missing their frontal lobe.<br />I was very entertained with the way this book haunted my own ethics.  Amazingly, I found myself cheering for the criminal to get away with things.  I loved seeing how he was caught on greater than three occasions, and yet managed to get away.<br />If there is one downside, I would say that it is the abruptness with which the book ends.  It cuts away before explaining how Frank was able to transition back to mainstream society.  <br />Alas, if you want to thoroughly entertain yourself while learning about a life in crime... buy this book.  It is sure to delight.	2001-12-27

His writing is very thought provoking in this essay on using your writing to convey meaning.  It is not his best book, but it is certainly worthy of the 1 hour it takes to read.<br />I think this book, as other Mamet books, benefits by his ironclad belief that there is one way to do things.  He may actually argue that his POV is not consistent with my last sentence, but he is such an ornery S.O.B., that it is simply a pleasure to listen to him go off on his tirades and tangents.  <br />Will this book allow you to write better? - Maybe.  Will this book thoroughly entertain you and enlighten you with Mamet's POV on the issue? - Absolutely.  It reads almost like fiction.	2001-12-15

It is a basic introduction to editing from film, as well as non-linear editing (computers).  It gives detailed information on what information is needed in order to get your film cut correctly, avoid drop frame and conversion issues, etc.  I think that it is very rudimentary however.  I am not an editor so I can't speak to that point of view, but as a director - I did not feel that the book taught me much of anything... and certainly nothing about integrating the three leading NLE systems.<br />I think the true niche for this book is beginning film school students, or people without a background in film editing at all.  These people I believe would benefit highly.  If you have worked exclusively with DV and video, and have no experience in film... then it would benefit you too.  <br />Overally, I'm happy I read it, but I insist that if someone were trained already with a background in film, then this book will be too basic to be truly helpful.	2001-12-15

In its pursuit of distilling Einstein to a more personal level, it still rings shallow.  There were so many relationships discussed in such cursory detail, that I was not able to get a flavor for Einstein's interactions with magnificent scientists such as Born, Bohr, Plank, Milliken, etc.  <br />The books strength is that it is fact laden.  If you finish this book, then you will be able to discuss the individual elements of his life with 98% of people.  It dispels a lot of lure, and at the same time illuminates some majestical quotes.  <br />One of my biggest beefs with the layout of this novel is that the author goes to great pains to break his life into 1 to 2 year intervals (which I like), but the chapter titles never seem to come across in what is written.  For example there is a chapter title called &quot;The FBI Targets Einstein&quot; yet the chapter itself has very little to do with that, and certainly doesn't differ from the surrounding chapters that discuss Hoover.  Thus, I felt that an opportunity to explore various elements of Einstein's life were entirely lost.  If it had been presented in relation to ideas as opposed to time frame, then perhaps Einstein would have been better illuminated.<br />I realize that this review is a bit harsh.  The bottom line is that I feel that I am better off from having read the book.  Nevertheless, I must be honest and say that as a scientist and idolizer of Einstein... I found this book extremely painful to read.  It gives a lot of information, but not in a particularly user-friendly manor.	2001-11-19

It is packed with information that is presented in a very basic manner so that anyone can understand it.<br />The book is divided into different sections ranging from investing and insurance, to estate planning.  In each of these sections, the contents are further divided into different phases of people's lives (20-30's, 40-50's, 60'+).  This is helpful in allowing one to reflect on their own strategies as well as where they may be headed.<br />Again, the real strength of this book is how rudimentary it is.  It would be a terrible disappointment to anyone that has even a minimal understanding of finance.  Thus, if you are seriously considering this book, know that it will be a good refresher if you are rusty, or jumping off point if you have no knowledge.<br />I was particularly impressed with the discussion on estate planning.  I have an advanced background in finance and investing, but nevertheless was able to gleam a pearl or two.<br />This book makes a great reference as well.  I chose to read it cover to cover, but it would have been equally as helpful as a reference book.  People with children may even consider purchasing it as a project to go over with their kids.

The story itself held my attention, but the resolution was absent.<br />This is the story of Katie &amp; David, a British couple who have lost the flame of their marriage after too many years of not trying.  It starts with their relationship in crisis, because Katie has looked to other means to achieve the attention she needs.  She is a good person, a doctor as she tells us numerous times, but she has become sick of her husbands scathing negativity.<br />The truly interesting thing about this story was the relationship of a house-husband verses a single female provider.  It was interesting to see the historical roles reversed.  David, filled with pain, decides to seek alternative medicine advice... and when he is cured of his pains and negative energy... Katie is really unsure of what to do with herself.<br />The story is entertaining, and I enjoyed its exploration of \\"political correctness\\" and what exactly doing enough for others is.  Unfortunately, I do not feel that the characters were ever resolved, nor was it always believable that they would act as they did.<br />If you are a Nick Hornby fan, you may enjoy this book.  He is a very skilled writer.  However, if you are just checking him out for the first time - I would recommend you start with \\"High Fidelity\\" and come back to this one later.  Happy reading!	2001-11-02

Flinn starts his book with the admission that he has never written any great movies... and then states blatently that he didn't write this book because he can write screenplays, but rather because he has had to read a ton of them.<br />Well thank god he did, because he distills horribly written screenplays into crystal clear examples of why they are poorly written.  This information is wonderful, and I found myself delighting in his revealing why I too am unsatisfied with the screenplays I have written.<br />The book is broken into two primary sections with a third &quot;final thought section.&quot;  The first is devoted to form, and he cuts to the chase providing examples of &quot;good writing&quot; and, even more importantly, examples of &quot;bad writing&quot;.  He examples are very accessible, and will illustrate to any writer, producer, or director why it is that they want to cut their wrists when reading some screenplays, and can't put others down.<br />The second half of the book is devoted to content.  This is not as strong as the first half, but is certainly on par or slightly better than most books on how to write your story.  He even quotes from all of the guru's of screenwriting, and shows that they are all ultimately trying to say the same thing.<br />I am absolutely serious when I say it is the best book on screenwriting I have ever read.  I think it should be manditory reading for anyone that ever thinks of giving their screenplay to another individual to read.  Happy writing!!!	2001-10-24

Like any collection, some interviews are more informative than others.  Nevertheless, I found this book to be entirely entertaining as I was brought into the world of other directors' first experiences.<br />Throughout all of the interviews, I found the same recurring theme of panic surface.  I was particularly impressed with the interview with Ang Lee where he discusses his quick success out of NYU and then 7 years of drought, as well as James Mangold's rocket to stardom taken down by his snide remarks to Katzenberg.<br />This book is probably more properly titled \\"Self Help\\" book for anyone that wants to make a movie, as you realize that the directors featured in this book are really no different from anyone else.  In a few cases (I'll refrain from telling you), I actually found myself saying, \\"Why WOULD anyone have ever let this person direct a film.\\"  Thus, the reader will be comforted to know that if he or she keeps pushing, eventually they will get their project made.<br />Overall, the book is a wonderfully delightful read.  My recommendation is to read a chapter a day, and then watch the director's movie... this will maximize the pleasure and reading experience.	2001-10-16

I was given this book as a present, and must admit that I am probably one of the only people that has NEVER read a Stephen King novel. Thus, I approached it tentatively at first, but quickly found that I could not put it down... and realized just how articulate Mr. King is.<br />King makes no promises to transform you into an excellent writer. He likens write to unearthing an archeologic dig, and claims he doesn't even know how the story will end while he is writing it.<br />The book is divided into a number of sections, reflecting his life. The first of which is titled &quot;CV&quot; and is a thoroughly delightful look into how King got to where he is. It details his rejection slips as well as his first successes... and does a nice job of showing the influences that pushed him into the &quot;Stephen King&quot; world.<br />The second section is the meat and potatoes on his writing suggestions. The books insights into making dialogue and character descriptions interesting is invaluable. He even takes the time to show an example of a first draft chapter, and then his exact hand written changes for the rewrite. I found this to be extremely illuminating.<br />His final section is on life. Perhaps the books biggest gem for me was in illuminating the man. I came away from this book with two realizations. The first, by his examples of how he writes, was just how much of a genius he truly is in his field. The second, by the honesty expressed in this book, is just what a great man he truly is... he comes across as the kind of guy a person would love to have as a friend... in other words - he is very &quot;real&quot; and warm in his description of his problems with drugs, and a nearly fatal car accident.<br />I cannot help but recommend this book as one of the most enjoyable I have read this year.	2001-09-09

Nevertheless, this one left me a little hollow.  There were certainly some pearls of wisdom, but people would have to dig deeply to find them in this book.<br />On the positive side, I like that Mamet attempts to steer Actors away from their rituals and instead plant in their heads that they need to show up and do the job... it is that simple.  &quot;There is no character arc... there is no motivation.&quot;  Having directed 6 films, I can relate to how damaging the &quot;character arc&quot; in an actors head can be.  Leave the &quot;character arc&quot; to the director... it is his or her job to follow the melody of the film.<br />Another positive detail was his emphasis on becoming a true artist... and how a true artist longs for the theater or any role - not just fame.  I was particularly happy with his discussion on people that have backup plans... as he states they will end up doing their backup plan.  I like his notion that in order to succeed you must bind your life blood to the task at hand.<br />Here I am trying to come up with the positives, and I am having a difficult time.  I think that therefore leads me into the negatives.  This book is nearly impossible to decipher, even for an intelligent person.  It reads like the Torah in ancient Hebrew.  While I am sure there are plenty that can do that, it is pretty damn difficult, and in this case - I would argue not worth the time.<br />The next dangerous thing that really screams out was his emphasis on not going to school to study.  I certainly understand this, because an &quot;untalented&quot; actor that goes to school may become even worse if they are misguided.  Nevertheless, there are plenty of people that I have worked with that were infinitely better after having had some formal training.  Thus, I am concerned that &quot;would be&quot; actors reading this book will use it as an excuse or validation fortheir not seeking training... which could (and likely will) damage their chances for getting roles.<br />Again, I could continue to go on, but why bother... especially since I think that is my ultimate feeling on this book---Why bother?

US	52471263	R1EHRIZCJS96U5	0449005550	12958692	Candles on Bay Street	Books	2	7	12	N	N	A Review From the Male POV	I want to acknowledge upfront that this book is a 5 star in the hearts and minds of all of my women friends that have read it. It was passed on to me by an Aunt that insisted I should try to option it to make it into a film. After having read it... I thought it was dreck, not because of the story, but because of the way it was told and the writing style... which leads me to believe it has a very specific reader audience.<br />The novel starts off great. I am immediately in the heart and mind of the main character Sammy. He recounts first love in a way that drew me right in. I longed for this relationship, and was even more impressed with how it turned out as Sammy ends up going to veterinary school. It was at this point a very cute and endearing story of life in a small city and first love.<br />The book started to unravel (for me) right around page 30. It is transformed into this serious story from the time Dee Dee (15 years later) moves back into Sammy's world. If the story had been told or built at this point on the notion of Sammy having his first true love as well as his wife that he loved... well, then I would have had an intersting story. But unfortunately, the author (and completely unsubtly) drops hints that Dee Dee is going to die. Thus, the rest of the book is a painfully written 230 additional pages milking the emotion of a loved one dying.<br />I know that there are people that are going to be pissed with this review, but please take the time to think through how the relationship is dependent on what Sammy tells us. There is no character development beyond constantly confronting the inevitable. Additionally, we certainly would have had higher stakes had the relationship been built and it had been even a hint of a surprise what was to come. Had we been offered the opportunity by the writer to truly feel Sammy's delight with the return of Dee Dee... she would not have been treated as a decaying corpse from the get go... thus the devastation on Troup's life would have brought me to tears too.<br />Bottom line... this book is going to be considered great by a lot of people, but it saddens me that such a wonderful story was so poorly told. So for anyone that thinks this should be made into a movie, you are probably right... just don't hire the author to write the screenplay.	2001-09-09

This book takes the filmmaker through understanding exactly what goes into getting the best image imaginable onto film.  The true treasure of this book is that is was written long ago enough that the author does not feel bound to polical writing: in this authors world there are black and white rules of what is acceptable and unacceptable.  While &quot;creative-types&quot; may find his insistance on what can be done insulting to their vision, I think we can all agree that if you are going to break the rules, it is important to know them.  If you read this book and study it, then you will KNOW the rules and UNDERSTAND when, why, and where you need to break them.  It is a delightful read, filled with information, and though written in the 1960's... the concepts are timeless and very applicable to filmmakers in the 2000's.  Buy it and enjoy it!  Best Wishes....Jason	2001-07-12

If you are a director that does not believe in running with the actors own take on a character, then this book would be painful for you to try to read.  Nevertheless, if you are looking to have a truly collaborative experience (not all of us are), the advice contained within is very solid. <br />Weston breaks the process of working with actors down to how to give concise words to help get a performance.  She further spends time developing adjustment techniques.  I think this book is particularly strong in its discussions on script breakdown, and having multiple approaches to playing a scene.  It gives some helpful advice on casting as well, and really challenges a director to cast the best person in a role as opposed to the one that they feel &quot;nailed the part&quot; based on ones preconceived notions.<br />The biggest weakness in this book is that really favors the actor over the director at times, and leaves me asking (as a director) why would I want to have this relationship.  I do not believe, as Weston proports, that a director should always allow the actor to find the voice of his or her character without explicit direction.  Nevertheless, it certainly challenged my own technique, and I am a better filmmaker from having read it.	2001-05-29

The characters are alive, and you truly feel sorry for the simplicity of the subjects life.  Botton, a Swiss native, is a master of British humor... and many funny moments come through on the page as he writes the definitive biography of Isabel Rogers.  It is a book that really does a great job of poking fun at biographers and what they must do in order to capture the essence of a person.

It had the same feel and magnitude of that timeless classic.  The story centers on a new crime family and their branching into the world of Vegas Gambling and Hollywood.  It is more of a West Coast mafia tale, and is pure entertainment.  The first 80 pages are a little slow, but by the time you hit 100, you can't put the book down and very well may stay up far later than you had hoped for.  Puzo weaves an exciting tale of complexity sure to delight crime family genre lovers...	2001-05-20

They are great and riveting.  Thereafter it is stale and rather painful.  It is a &quot;true story&quot; and is terrifying to think of in terms of what could have happened in our own backyard.  Nevertheless, pay attention to my warning and definitely do yourself the favor of reading two chapters before deciding whether to order it.

That said, its strength is that it is one of the only books on directing that actually takes you through shot composition, different lenses, and the cinematic achievement that can be created by various devices ranging from cranes to simple editing techniques.  Overall, I feel that I learned some new things from this book, but at the same time - after having read it cover to cover - it just doesn't strike me as a great reference book... as I had hoped it would be.	2001-05-20

As a filmmaker and writer, I have developed a sense for writing crap that appeals to the lowest common denominator.  Mamet made me re-evaluate what made me become a writer, and the importance of the theater.  I find his writing very interesting from the standpoint that he is very much of the theater, and an elitist as a result, but he is very favorable when discussing Hollywood.  I think everyone should read his section on the Oscars in this book.  Overall, I was very pleased I read the book, and would have to ultimately recommend it to others.	2001-05-01

This book was thoroughly enjoyable to read, but had very little advice on actual editing.  It is very worth reading, if for nothing else, to hear the author's words (he is a god of editing).  Nevertheless, I really wanted more on his ideas behind making cuts instead of abstract thoughts.  His three pearls are: 1) Stand up when editing, 2) When a person blinks it is because they got the concept and are making a &quot;mental cut&quot;, and that we are going to move into a time of digital editing, but must remember our past.  There... I saved you the 10 dollars. Buy it to enjoy it, but don't expect it to teach more than I just revealed...	2001-04-22
