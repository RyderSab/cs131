One morning teenagers awaken to discover that all adults have turned into zombie-like creatures that want to destroy them.  The entire world is flipped upside down as immature teens must suddenly take responsibility for their own lives and those of their friends in order to save &quot;humanity.&quot;  Mr. Clark brings a literate sensibility to all he does, and he's never finer than in this novel.  It's violent, emotionally affecting, and the plot twists and turns enough to keep any reader squirming in his seat.  If you haven't read it, do yourself the favor and find it immediately.  You won't be sorry you did.	2002-12-04

While ostensibly imaginative, the plot here is hobbled by Ms. Jacobs prose, which is so overblown that it fails to do what it should: communicate a strong story with a powerful voice.  Instead, we're attacked by purple prose.  Ms. Jacobs needs to set her thesaurus aside (or more likely, to turn it off on her Word Program) and write in a more direct, clear and sophisticated manner.	2002-12-04

As he attempts to solve the crime, we learn that he suffers from stigmata, where his hands bleed whenever someone at the school dies.  As his hands bleed more and more as he hunts the trail of killings across the university, he gains a greater education than he'd ever hoped for.<br />It's a complex plot with some of the most offbeat and bizarre scenes I've read in years. A spooky, startling novel that will keep you glued to your seat until you finally finish the course.	2002-11-30

He grows more and more obsessed with not only finding the killer, but discovering the true identity of the victim.<br />Slowly our protagonist, Caleb Prentiss, comes to fear that he's haunted not only by the dead girl, but also by his own sister--a former nun who committed suicide in his arms.  Ever since that time, Cal has suffered from stigmata whenever someone close to him dies.<br />Despite the backstory, the book itself takes place in a 24 hour period.  Cal learns more in this day than in his four years of higher education.

He packs so much into the story I'm still surprised at how short the piece is.  Other favorites include works by Jerry Stahl (a short but hilarious tale, really), Susie Bright, J. T.

The author has clearly done his homework where Judeo-Christian dogma and &quot;the black arts&quot; are concerned, as well as historically studying the Holy City of Jerusalem.  The last third of the novel takes place in Jerusalem (and the &quot;Hills of Megiddo,&quot; better known to us as Armageddon).  The novel takes classical elements of horror and dark fantasy and turns them on their ear, giving us a haunted protagonist, a silver-tongued &quot;devil&quot; of a sidekick, and an exotic setting towards the end of the world.  A beautiful, daring, original and inventive novel that is as haunting for its themes on religion and redemption as for its horrific elements.  Powerful and literate.	2001-12-21

On the surface it's about a writer who goes back to his childhood home to investigate a series of ax murders that claimed his whole family but there's plenty more here than that.  We're talking high fantasy, low fantasy, dark fantasy and just plain weirdness as our hero must face ghosts, animal people in a forest, and a haunting little girl who probably doesn't really exist.  This takes on the idea of the creative urge being a primal force that drives us from &quot;beyond&quot; and executes it wonderfully.  You'll never read horror fiction quite the same way again.

The story follows a modern day warlock and his demon sidekick named &quot;Self&quot; (what a trip) as they struggle with their old coven master who has started a series of supernatural events that will culminate in Armageddon.  Our hero must battle a new coven, fight a half-angelic mutant being in the bowels of a haunted abbey, and hunt through Jerusalem where the God's power seems to be boiling over.  There are also demons, djinn, evil monks, ghosts, and the walking dead along for the ride.  Piccirilli uses and comments on faith, history, theology, folklore, prophecy and other so-called &quot;large spiritual matters&quot; but does it in such a way that the story rolls along at a rip-roaring pace.  The writing is solid, poetic, and completely gripping.  The author's imagination is fiery and wild, but his skills as a writer hold everything in balance.  There's humor here, relationships, love, vengeance and heartbreak.  One of the best horror novels I've ever read.  More Self!	2001-11-30

For years Tom Piccirilli has been publishing short stories featuring an unnamed &quot;Necromancer&quot; and his demonic familiar &quot;Self,&quot; who wander America and find supernatural evils just about wherever they go.  Their history is long, complex, and entwined--the Necromancer tries to overcome his more impulsive &quot;Self&quot; and fight for the side of good, although, as we learn, sometimes Heaven is just as fouled up as Hell.   Now Piccirilli's brought us the first novel featuring this duo and it's been well-worth the wait.  In A LOWER DEEP the two are forced to confront their old coven leader, Jebediah DeLancre, who wishes to force the premature return of Christ.  Though the Necromancer is opposed to this, Jebediah dangles an offer that can't be refused: the resurrection of the Necromancer's one true love, Danielle.  The original coven was destroyed during a horrifying ritual gone wrong, and now the ghosts of those members plus new witches from a second order either aid or attack the Necromancer along his path.  Eventually he finds himself at Mount Armon, a monestary where even more creepy events occur, as a little boy harbors occult forces and an infant may be sacrificed to bring life to a Nephilim, an abominable creature devoid of soul that is half angel and half human.  The abbot and monks of Armon must take sides as unfolding circumstance seem to signal Armageddon.  This leaves the Necromancer and Self no choice but to head to Jerusalem, where they attempt to fight against the end of the world.  But is &quot;Self&quot; actually there to help or is he truly in league with Hell?  Piccirilli keeps us guessing as he unveils a well-researched and sprawling tapestry of black rituals, mythology, paganism, witchcraft, Judeo-Christian beliefs, and a multitude of characters who are confused, terrified, and trapped by their own intentions as the apocalypse approaches.  Piccirilli writes with a fluid, punchy, gripping narrative voice, but despite all the horrific events occurring there's often an edge of humor as &quot;Self&quot; sarcastically quips along.  Highly recommended.	2001-10-16

Hexes is a solid read full of intricate storytelling prowess and a wonderful use of language.  This isn't just another horror novel filled with gratuitous gore and simplistic writing, this is a tale that tries to cross genres and bring something new to readers.  I appreciated Mr. Piccirilli's efforts and loved his use of symbolism and bittersweet back story that adds a whole new poignancy to the novel.  Flashbacks to a bitter and haunting childhood--hence the repeated &quot;Debbi is dead&quot; references--show how an emotionally distraught protagonist fearing for his life and soul can still rise to be a hero.

His fluid poetic voice will either grab you by the heartstrings or push you out of the narrative.  This isn't commercial fiction but a unique blending of fantasy, horror, and mainstream literature.  The Deceased follows a young man's emotional derailment as he returns to the childhood home where his entire family was murdered.  He has the power to create a new life form out in the nearby forest, and as his creations and creativity distort his mind, so distorts the world around him.  Caught up in all this oddity are two women with plenty of problems of their own, who might either fall prey to this new strange world or help our protagonist fight against it.  Piccirilli sweeps the reader into a constantly changing landscape where dreams and heartache, history and heartache all fuse into one.  A wonderfully odd novel.	2001-10-12

The author deliberately tears down the foundation of reality in the secluded setting of this novel.  What you wind up with his a man haunted by his past, followed by ghosts and his own (stories?) creations.  I loved the idea of the muses being animals turned into human-like companions.  A certain Robert Holdstock atmosphere pervades the novel, though The Deceased is clearly more outright horrific.  Dark fantasy that's meant to spin your wheels and make you think.

A man forced by ghosts to return to his childhood home where his family was murdered ten years earlier.  Clearly, Piccirilli's bizarre style is going to either grab you or leave you cold.  There doesn't seem to be much middle-ground with THE DECEASED.  Although some of these reviewers seem to wag their chins saying any five star review is a lie, you can believe me that this one isn't.

It's definitely not for the lazy-minded, or even somebody just looking for a quick sit-down Sunday morning read.  Piccirilli's narrative style is full-throttle weirdness that scoops the reader into a story that breaks rules at every turn.  Jacob Maelstrom's sister goes insane one night in their secluded home and murders everyone in the house except him, including herself.  Ten years later, he experiences visions and hauntings that force him to return to that place, where he must face the ghosts of his family and discover what actually happened and what really drove his sister mad.  I loved the literary fireworks and bombastics here, never knowing exactly what would happen next.  Though the plotline isn't linear and does loop back upon itself, I enjoyed the fact that Piccirilli was willing to take risks with form and style in order to give the reader something new.  Try it if you want something that breaks the old mold.	2001-05-08

Piccirilli's brand of horror is a heady brew of style, the occult, and the surreal.  He offers up levels of hell for the reader to traverse: the hell of the mind, of the soul, and the fiery place itself.  He writes with a real passion, the heartache coming through as his characters battle their own weaknesses as well as the evil that's been loosed.  This again shows why Tom Piccirilli is one of the best in the business: he doesn't simply tell a story of murder and mayhem and monsters chewing on livers.  He writes of people forced to face the demons in themselves first before battling anything else.  A creepy winner here, folks, full of some of the best atmospheric horror you've ever read.	2001-03-12

Piccirilli toys with conventions with a sure hand, and in The Deceased shows why he's one of the genre's best.  In a looming secluded house, Jacob Maelstrom must discover the secrets to his murdered family and find out what bizarre role he played in their deaths.  The ghost of a writer continues weaving tales that affect the living, the woods are full of haunted half-human creatures, and two young women must suffer through Jacob's torments with him.  Piccirilli's stylish manner makes this a full reading experience, that draws the reader down into the surreal, insane world of the damned.  This is powerful horror fiction at its best.	2001-03-12

This is heady stuff that Piccirilli writes about.  You won't just find the usual running from the serial killer fare, but a dark fantasy that's bent on bursting free from the envelope.  A young man returns home to the mansion where his sister murdered the entire family and herself, leaving him the only survivor.  In a series of flashbacks that play out side by side with the present situation, the main character Jacob Maelstrom is something like Kurt Vonnegut's Billy Pilgrim from Slaughter-House Five.  he moves back and forth, talking with the living and the dead, existing in the past and the present, and dealing with a little girl who might have been murdered or might not exist at all.

I plan to immediately rectify that mistake.  THE DECEASED is not simply a read, it's an experience to cherish.  The author does things with language, plot, and style the likes of which I've never seen before.  If you like unwaveringly simplistic stories, this isn't going to be your cup of tea.  If you've got any unresolved family issues or anger with your parents and siblings, this might dredge up some of your worst fears.  An ambitious, unique and decidedly fulfilling and satisfying book.	2000-11-17
