Antidepressants are helpful for those times when you really do need them - but they are drugs, and as such they have their negative side. I hope that I can find a natural solution - but fighting the battle is hard - and I admire anyone who has the power to meet the struggle.	2005-08-04

One thing puzzles me though - the author stresses at one point not to fall into the trap of idolatry. This seems to be very usefull advice and all - but haven't we already fallen into that trap by reading this book - it seems like quite a paradox to me - anyway....it is an enjoyable book that makes one's admiration of Proust that much greater - it may even help us enjoy the world we live in a little more - a fantastic effort!	2005-04-28

It still seems that there is some hope for love, until the attempt to kiss Albertine towards the end of the novel places it just out of reach.<br /><br />There also is a glimmer of hope in the character of Elstir, whose impressionism offers a new way of looking at things. Overall, the book is an interesting homage to the journey of youth and we are left with a longing for even more than the 730 pages contain.	2005-04-27

He structures themes in such a profound way that after you read him other authors start to seem flimsy in their approach. 'Swann's Way' is one of the greatest books about life and love I have read (so far) but I think you must look at it as part of a whole - a whole which one day I hope to grasp!	2005-04-06

One thing is for certain - it is a difficult,long read. It is also, strangely, very hard to put down and it leaves you searching for meaning and just in a state of complete wonder. Amazingly, Joyce is able to convey each character's thoughts and dialect in a way that has never been achieved by anyone else.  It feels almost as if each character was composed by  a different author - they are so unique and detailed. Though I cannot express much of anything that has not already been said - let me make one recommendation to the reader of Ulysses - read something to help you through it (even cliff notes) and also read the Odyssey again  - you will find this very helpful in navigating through this remarkable text.	2005-02-24

All his desires are finely crafted here and his book is , as usual, crammed with idols and mystification. What prevents me from calling this his greatest novel is the influence of Sartre. By this point, as Genet's biographrer Edmund White has pointed out, Genet was conciously incorporating the use of Sartre's theories in his work (as Sartre at that time was Genet's friend - and sort of replacement for Jean Cocteau). The novel lacks the inovation of 'Our Lady' - but at the same time it has many more direct personal references to Genet himself.<br /><br />What makes Genet, for me, one of the greatest writers of the 20th century is the way he embraces fate. He is always so clear in his novels about what is going to happen and the significance of what is going to happen. Thus, his writing always sounds so inevitable and profound - and his characters are like shrines of worship - he creates mythology. This is what makes Genet so refreshing to me - and he is, in my opinion, an equal to authors like Proust, Joyce, and Kafka - a gem of self-concious literature.<br /><br />The Thiefs Journal is a good place to start with Genet. It is very clear and detailed and he pours the same great poetic prose into it - that he gave books like 'Our Lady' and 'Querelle'.	2005-01-17

Though I do not pretend to be an authority on psychology myself - I find something in Jung that is almost more spiritual than scientific. Of course, Jung will not be readily excepted in modern circles for his lack of empirical evidence - but that is not what concerns me - he is a fascinating figure and writer. All I know is there will always be something in life and science that is inexplicable - and this is what makes people like Freud and Jung live on forever - they are so willing to search for what is unknown.	2004-12-27

This is one of my favorites, in a way, because its theme is so straight forward and yet so hard to grasp. Much has been written about this book and many film versions have been made. My take on it is that it is kind of an ironic and absurd voyage that takes place. Marlow plunges into this darkness with such fervor only to find something at the other end which makes the whole voyage seem like it was all in vain - just as Kurtz attempts at a successful love-life came to the same disapointing end. So Kurtz simplifies his existence to its basic human form - and only begins to accentuate the worst trait of humanity - greed. It is almost like Thomas Hobbes' vision of humanity - something completely vile. Our only hope in the end is Marlow - what does he learn from this - food for thought.	2004-12-26

In this book he presents us with a web of characters that can only reach mythical preportions. And, interestingly enough, he reveals that the only reason for their creation is for his own pleasure. So the book becomes like a walk through Genet's subconcious, in which we meet different aspects of the total personality that is Jean Genet. The book is like a dream and throughout it we are confronted with monsters, saints, nuns, prison guards, and the most secret of desires. Genet is the only author I have read who is capable of opening himself so completely - and we do get the feeling that this is written for his own pleasure - this makes it all the more enjoyable for us to read!	2004-12-13

Thus, it is an interesting trip into the imagination of this great thinker - and his world of fantasy is enlightening and in a strange way quite profound and poetic.<br /><br />Querelle can be interpreted in many ways - but it cannot be disputed that this story is in a way about the double nature of all human beings. Readers of 'Our Lady of the Flowers' will be familiar with this rich puzzling theme. Genet creates a world, in which, the most hidden desires of men are amplified to the extent that these very desires become a personality unto themseselves. In a way these characters become prisoners to their own fantasies (much of Genet's writing has something to do with prison) and in a most tragic way. The character of Madame Lysiane, for example, is the clearest picture of this imprisonment. She is involved with the two brothers and the neglective Nono - never fully accepted or loved by any one person - she has to live a fragmented life giving parts of herself to many different people at the same time.<br /><br />What makes Genet brilliant is not necesarrily just his portrait of the double, however. There is a certain inevitability in his writing. He seems to believe in a certain fate for all things. His embracing of fate consistently in his prose - makes him, like Kafka, stand out among other writers. He truly was a poet of the highest order. I would recommend starting with 'Querelle' - it is a nice introduction to Genet's work and is perhaps the easiest of all his books to get into.	2004-12-12

I was perhaps, more or less, curious when I picked this book up at a used book store a few years ago. As I read it - this curiosity was very deeply rewarded - and I fell in love with Suzuki's style of writing - and his presentation of Zen - which for me (a westerner) pieced together a rather loose understanding I had at the time and gained something of a background into the great mysteries of Asian (esp. Japanese) culture and ways of life. This book enlightened new ideas of embracing simplicity and poverty - not usually seen in the west (where we long for belongings). Another thing Suzuki stresses is dicipline - something lacking in many western interpretations of Zen.	2004-11-04

To learn more about Genet, I would highly recommend his biography by Edmund White - this is one of the best biographies I have read.<br /><br />The 'Maids' is a play in one act with three charactors. Within this act Genet captures the role-playing of the classes of society rather brilliantly. He does not capitalize on the brutality of the actual case of murder (it is based on an actual murder) but looks instead at the motivations for doing it. There is a film adaptation of the story called 'Murderous Maids' which is pretty good but focuses mainly on the act of murder - and throws in a lesbian twist.	2004-10-06
