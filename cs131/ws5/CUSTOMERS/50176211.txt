Over 1,600 years ago, one man developed a technology to enable his dying 12-year-old sister to survive.  The only hitch is that the patient had to die first and be resurrected.<br />Having provided this new technology, the man is proclaimed Emperor over the 80 Worlds and the bureaucratic rule of his administration, &quot;The Apparatus&quot;, weighs heavily upon the populace.  The Risen citizens become wealthy, rigid, and somewhat emotionless throughout time.  The Empire begins to stagnate.  <br />Westerfeld compares the lack of innovation to earlier Earth theories in which the sun revolved around the planet.  Newer (and correct) theories that the Earth revolved around the sun were ridiculed and suppressed until the previous generation died off and the new scientists took control.  In the Empire, no such situation is possible.<br />This novel describes the fates of two figures, a starship captain and a senator who, against all odds, can change the universe forever.<br />When the Emperor's sister is held hostage by the Empire's traditional enemies, the starship captain is directed to rescue her....before the Emperor's secret is discovered.  And the Political Apparatus has representives on board his ship to ensure that he carries out his orders.<br />Meanwhile, the senator back on Home must help determine the course of war.<br />All that ties them...and the only true thing that matters...is their love for each other.<br />Westerfeld skillfully shifts viewpoints between major and minor characters and even time periods to create a wonderful action/adventure story.  The plot and history unfold beautifully.  His cultures and shifting alliances are well executed.	2004-02-11

No &quot;true&quot; humans exist.  Only one modified individual is in her somewhat original body.  Other &quot;humans&quot; are engrams (or copies of engrams), a computer simulation of a real person.  Some of the engrams seem more human than others as they begin to break free of their programming or begin taking on more physical bodies.<br />The authors provide a myriad of encounters with very strange alien species, all of whom are attempting to survive in a hostile universe -- there a hints that two warring species (collectively called the Ambivalence) may be both benefactor and annihilator.<br />Unfortunately, the novel itself ends, apparently exhausted by its own innovative and interesting ideas.  None of the various story threads are knotted at the end and the big concepts merely peter out.<br />All in all, however, I would recommend the books to others.  Williams and Dix have created a weird and awe-inspiring world and truly alien creatures and their philosophies.	2004-01-27

I recommend reading various reviews on Amazon rather than rely on the blurb on the book's back cover since it misleads the reader -- specifically, the book is more about intrigue, shifting alliances, socio-economic warfare, and prejudice rather than merely a hard-core examination of artificial intelligences and viruses.<br />In fact, Zettel seems driven to put a human face on bigotry and prejudice and is using science fiction imagery to make her case.  She describes many types of bigotry:  <br />Religious -- Several of the main characters are Muslim and their faith is an integral part of who they are.  Not everyone they meet, however, can separate the individual from terrorist acts that occurred in the past.<br />Spiritual / philosophical -- A community has arisen that denies that humankind will ever be truly free when trapped on a single planet.  Humankind must create its own environments and be master of its own fate rather than rely on the capricious nature of Nature.  These individuals are ridiculed and, in essence, reviled for their beliefs and are considered second class citizens.  Zettel even makes one of her enlightened characters intolerant of members of this cultural \\"diversity\\".<br />Life-form -- Human vs. artificial intelligence.  What does it mean to be human, or alive?  Are humans so inherently xenophobic that they cannot accept the possibility of other types of life?  Are artificial intelligences so jaundiced that they must instill fear rather than convince?<br />All in all, this is a very strong book.  Strong characterization, strong plot, enough twists and turns to make things interesting.	2003-08-26

They manage to escape and limp to the nearest planet with an acceptable atmosphere, hoping to find the resources they need to repair their ship. When they arrive, they find a primitive society, apparently the descendants of a lost colony.<br />To their amazement, the O'Hara brothers find that the planet supports dragons, a mystical race of powerful beings who have, for the most part, remained aloof from the humans. Until now. In the past, one of their own acquired the taste for human flesh and had to be destroyed. Another outcast wants to control the human race.<br />Although the O'Hara brothers just want to collect the elements they need and leave, they become caught up in the fate of this world.<br />The characterization is rather weak. The three brothers are almost indistinguishable from one other and all have similar names which just adds to the confusion. Radford doesn't supply any firm motivations for their actions; this became irritating at times. The motivation of the villain is particularly flat.  Why does he want to kill everyone?  He seems to be interested in acquiring and using power; if he kills everyone, who is left to worship him?  The few potentially interesting individuals (the fiery Hestiia and the mysterious flywacket Gentian) are discarded or muted about halfway through the book.<br />Also, Radford doesn't pretend to be subtle in her storytelling.  She continually \\"hints\\" at things until you want to scream \\"Ok, Ok, I get it now!!\\"<br />But, for those of us who enjoy a bit of diverting adventure, the book does fulfill that requirement.<br />Readers of Radford's other series, \\"The Dragon Nimbus\\" and \\"The Dragon Nimbus History\\" will thrill to find familiar names and places: Simurgh, Hanassa, Yaakke, the Stargods, and the genesis of the nation of Coronnin.<br />Expect a cliffhanger...after all it is only volume one.	2002-03-18

It recounts the life of a young man who is born and raised on a backward planet where thought rarely rises beyond the immediate &quot;now&quot;.  Nicknamed &quot;Comet Jo&quot; for his curious need to look up at the stars, the young man is given an important message to deliver to the Empire Star... unfortunately, he doesn't know what the message is.  Neither does his eight-legged cat.  Their adventure, and the reader's, is to unravel the mystery.<br />The novella is quite straightforward at first, but the reader will discover that everything that has occurred takes on additional meaning by the end of the book.  The best way to describe the book is to say that it is the literary equivalent of an M.C. Escher print.<br />As one friend to another I, too, must recommend that you set aside some time to read the book and then immediately re-read it.	2002-03-11

Figran D'An and the Modal Nodes had been the exclusive band for Jabba the Hutt until accepting a gig for the wedding reception for another Tatooine gangster.  Normally, the band doesn't \\"do weddings\\" because they're too much trouble for far too few credits, but enough money and Figran's addiction to Saabac sweetens the deal.  <br /> <br />The dramatization is simply exceptional and the voice acting, particularly the Bith narrator (Doikk Na'ts, the fizzz player), is top notch.  The audio producer liberally adds appropriate background noise, Star Wars sound effects, and soundtrack snippets to bring the story to life.  Several new Modal Nodes tunes were also performed. <br /> <br />You may need to listen to the story several times before fully appreciating the story, but you'll want to.... it's THAT good.	2002-01-23
US	50176211	R19MFRKHJK30VZ	0812522400	629033060	Lord of the Isles	Books	1	46	58	N	N	Waste of my reading time	I read about 80-90 science fiction and fantasy novels a years and usually love multi-volume epic stories.  When reading a book, I usually &quot;stick it out until the end&quot;; I regret having done so here.  <br />Plain and simple, this book is terrible.  Here's a run-down of some of its most obvious flaws:<br />  1.  Non-existent plot.  I can't understand how an editor allowed this book to go to print.  The author didn't seem to understand that a series of unrelated episodes do not make a plot.  Most of the episodes don't enhance your understanding of a character, nor do they advance the plot.<br />  2.  Absolutely, beyond a shadow of a doubt, stupid (and I mean stupid) characters.  The main characters are not in any way introspective.  They never question what is happening around them.  They are not interested in the people around them.  They don't seem to really have any motivation for anything they do.  A couple of examples:  <BR>Garric learns that his sister is really the scion of a royal house and that their parents had been deceiving them since their childhood.  Is Garric surprised?  Is he hurt?  Does he care that his sister is leaving the sleepy village perhaps forever?  Does he question his parents about this?  Does he wonder about his own parentage?  The answer is a resounding &quot;no&quot;.<BR>A second example:  Another character is repeatedly told that he has &quot;power&quot;.  He is able to do magical things from time to time.  He is the only one who can see certain magical creatures.  But he never seems to put these things together that he is a wizard.  I know that he is supposed to be slow thinker, but he's not supposed to be dim-witted.<br />  3.  Finally, if I have to read the words &quot;Barca's Hamlet&quot; one more time, I think I'll scream.  I understand that the four main characters came from the aforementioned sleepy village and that life in the village is the only thing they can compare things to, but Drake takes it to the extreme.  If I had to make a guess, something is compared to Barca's Hamlet at least once every two to three pages.  (Now Drake has ME doing it... that's twice in this paragraph).<br />Anyway, pick up another epic series instead such as Martin's &quot;Song of Ice and Fire&quot; series or even Jordan's &quot;Wheel of Time&quot; neverending saga.  Believe me, the world of the &quot;Wheel of Time&quot; has a straightforward and interesting plot when compared to that of Barca's Hamlet (aaack, I've said it again!!!).	2001-12-20

Unfortunately, he missed a better plot and philosophical/moral discussion (see below).<br />Chimeras are genetically altered humans, a mixture of human and animal genetic material:  pigs, bears, dogs, among others.  Each chimera &quot;breed&quot; retains some of the characteristics of their animal donor species--strength, enhanced hearing, etc.  Chimeras are accepted in the society in the sense that no one seems to think twice about the ethics of their existence.  They are, however, considered second- or third-class citizens--virtual slaves which fill certain lower level jobs.<br />When a chimera is framed for the murder of a full human scientist, she searches for the only P.I. that can help her, a sarcastic man with a caustic wit.<br />The thing that bothered me most was that there was virtually no discussion of the ethical revolution that had to have taken place in the world to get to this point.  In my opinion, the book would have been more interesting if it were set in the earlier timeframe.  How did the religious groups react to the genetic manipulation?  Medical personnel?  Political parties?  Labor unions?  The general public?<br />Shetterly attempts to discuss the inequality of our current world by using the chimeras and artificial intelligences as an allegory for those that are discriminated against today.  I'm not sure that he fully realized this goal.<br />Nothing wrong with the book from a general escapist read, but in my opinion, the deeper meaning was somewhat flat.	2001-08-13

I just couldn't help myself--the artwork on the cover forced me to read them.  And I wasn't sorry.<br />Plan B is a direct sequel to Carpe Diem.  While some reviews have suggest that readers can begin with Plan B, I don't recommend doing so.  The characters' personalities are fleshed out in previous books as well as concrete examples of the Liaden and Clutch cultures.  For example, the concept of Liaden melant'i is present in this novel, but is perfectly explained in Conflict of Honors (this is the first novel collected in Partners in Necessity); if I hadn't read CoH, I'm afraid I would have missed the point.<br />Miri Robertson, a former mercenary sergeant, and Val Con yos'Phelium are fleeing several organizations who want them dead.  A crime syndicate has put a hit on Miri.  Val Con used to be a scout/spy for the mysterious Department of Interior, an nefarious group who are loyal to the citizens of Liad but have no conscience in achieving their goals.  When Val Con discovers the covert nature of the group, he defects.  When the &quot;ends justify the means&quot;, the Department of Liad has no ethical problem in hunting Val Con and destroying his outspoken and half-breed family.<br />Having escaped to Miri's family's homeworld, disaster strikes when a warlike alien race attacks the planet in conquest.  Will Val Con's family and Miri's mercenary friends arrive in time to save them?<br />This is a good bridge novel and leaves the reader aching for more.	2001-07-19

Listened to the unabridged version (the only way to listen to audio books!!) of the book on my daily commute to and from work (9 cassettes).  <br />I was NOT impressed by Jonathan Marosz's reading.  Marosz's patterns of speaking rarely changed during long sections of descriptive narration and the first person description.  His voice was monotone in places and Marosz continued to use the same inflections and cadences throughout.  It was occasionally painful to listen to until about the 3rd cassette tape when the author greatly increased his use of dialogue between the characters.  There, Marosz began to alter his tone, voice, dialect, etc. in such a way to keep the listener's interest.<br />Zahn, however, created a very interesting novel--more of a mystery novel set in space than a science fiction novel with mystery overtones.  The characters are interesting and varied, although many of the minor characters are a bit too minor.<br />Zahn doesn't show all of his cards until the final pages.  You will definitely be kept guessing until the last minute.  One of the most fascinating elements for me was the main character's ever changing theories.  Many mystery novels present a detective who unerringly goes down the correct path.  Zahn's Jordan McKell has to change his theories often as new facts come to light.<br />One thing that I would like to have seen was a picture or diagram of the &quot;Icarus&quot;, the spacecraft described through the book.  I had a hard time wrapping my mind around the halls and rooms.<br />One final remark on the audio book.  The publisher provided several great features for those who enjoy audio books: (1)  The narrator states which cassette and side you've reached and tells you when to insert the next tape.  I hate when you are uncertain whetherto turn over the tape or insert the next one.<br />(2)  The narrator repeats a sentence or two at the beginning of each new side or cassette.  This helps get you back to the story more quickly.<br />(3)  The sides end cleanly.  When you are asked to turn over the tape, the audio begins immediately--no rewinding or fast-forwarding is necessary.<br />This audiobook includes an excerpt from Episode I of Star Wars at the end.	2001-05-24

An &quot;aspect&quot; is the area that an individual can influence through mental concentration.  Convergeance introduces the 5 aspects of Earth, Air, Water, Fire, and Spirit.<br />Each year, those individuals with strong affinities for an aspect are required to go to the capital to test their strength.  Every 25 years, &quot;blendings&quot; of 5 talents can compete to become the rulers of the nation.  No one really knows what happens to those who fail.<br />Green introduces each character, brings them together for a chapter or two, and then describes their struggles and testing.  While sometimes repetitive, I found Green's technique rather comfortable and enjoyable as I watched each character deal with the same types of problems in subtly different ways.  Then she brings the characters back in touch with each other again so that they can compare notes and interact in friendship and intimacy.<br />Quite an endearing book.  You may want to make sure that you have the second novel handy as you near the end of Convergeance (Book 2 is called Competitions), because Green leaves you hanging.	2001-04-29

He considers his master a bit impractical in his use of magic...if you are not profiting from it, what good is it?  After conjuring a green-scaled demon, the old magician keels over dead, leaving Skeeve to deal with the demon himself.<br />The demon called Aahz, however, is merely a traveler from another &quot;dimen&quot;sion, called Perv.  Do not dare under any circumstances call Aahz a Pervert.  The denizens of Perv prefer &quot;Pervect&quot;; those who mis-speak tend to lose their lives.<br />Skeeve is from a backward dimension called Klah (residents are called Klahds, read &quot;clods&quot;) where technology is back at the medieval level.  Aahz has been everywhere and readers will enjoy many inside jokes from our own pop culture.<br />Another great feature of the books is the quote that begins each chapter, usually expounding on one of life's great truths.  One of my favorites is from chapter 21:  &quot;One must deal openly and fairly with one's forces if maximum effectiveness is to be achieved.&quot; -- D. Vader	2001-04-11

Huff attempted to do something new with gender by pushing a male into a female's body (actually, a brother and sister are sharing her body).  Personally, I think it fell rather flat.  The hint (well, MORE than a hint) of incestuous desires was mostly gratuitous.  I wasn't impressed.<br />In addition, I didn't care for the objects of their quest:  (1) to acquire the body of a prince and push HIS spirit out of his body and (2) to locate a &quot;could-have-been&quot; bard who is raising the dead, like zombies.  The whole &quot;walk of the living dead&quot; portions of the novel were too dark for me, but I generally prefer my fantasy to be more idyllic, epic, or lighthearted.<br />Hey, this book might be for you if the gothic or vampires appeal.  If not, I'd pass on this one.  Read &quot;Sing the Four Quarters&quot; (book 1) and &quot;The Quartered Sea&quot; (book 4) instead and skip the two middle novels.

Eve Forward answers a question I've had for years:  what happens in fantasy worlds when the Heroes have conquered the Dark Lord and Ultimate Evil is banished from the world?<br />Forward suggests in this tongue-in-cheek novel that Ultimate Good can be as bad as Ultimate Evil.  The idea is that free will might be compromised if there are no alternatives.<br />Six anti-heroes set out on a quest to right the wrong (or perhaps wrong the right?) done by the Heroes of old.  Each is somewhere on the scale of evil:  an out-of-work assassin, a former guild master of the thieves, a taciturn black knight, a Druidess who believes that balance is most important, a truly evil sorceress who enjoys a human snack now and then, and a hapless centaur who is really spying for Good.<br />Don't try to take the book too seriously--I don't believe Forward meant to create a timeless classic fantasy at the level of Tolkien or others.  Instead, she pokes fun at various created worlds and ideas.  One favorite of mine is when the assassin chastises the thief for his smoking habit.  &quot;I'm a Barrigan (a ethnic group), not a habbit.&quot;  True, not high comedy...but it got a chuckle out of me.<br />If you find this book at a used bookstore, pick it up.

She realizes her stubbornness, but clings on to the term &quot;independent&quot; rather than rebellious.  Annice has the bardic talent of calling all of the elemental spirits (&quot;kigh&quot;):  air, earth, fire, and water and she abandons her royal title to join the Bards.  The king places only one restriction...no children to threaten the succession.  <br />All is going well until Annice is found to be pregnant.  And the father of her unborn child is charged with treason.  Annice must rescue her lover, prove him innocent, and save the life of her child.<br />One important point:  the characters do have a sense of humor, and are not the flat, &quot;I-know-exactly-what-I'm-doing&quot; heros/heroines from other authors.<br />The book has much of the flavor of Mercedes Lackey's early Valdemar novels (Arrows of the Queen, etc.).<br />Although there are several more novels set in the &quot;Four Quarters&quot; world, this novel is truly a &quot;stand-alone&quot; book.  You may, however, want to visit the world again to understand the mysteries of the kigh.	2001-01-29

The Lost King is the first book of Margaret Weis' &quot;Star of the Guardians&quot; trilogy.  In this novel, Weis recounts mankind's continual struggle with the most appropriate form of government: republic or monarchy. <br />The galaxy has survived a short &quot;reign of terror&quot; where the monarchy is overthrown, the ruling class annihilated, and a president (and would-be dictator, named appropriately Peter Robes) installed.  <br />In the previous regime, genetically enhanced humans called Guardians are trained to power to protect and preserve the galaxy and monarchy.  One of their own betrays his king and country to remove the weak monarchy.  Now, decades later, disenchanted with the new rule of law, he searches for the scion of the royal house to be used for his own puppet rule. <br />Weis has constructed a believable political web.  All of her &quot;evil&quot; characters have rationales for their actions and believe that they are doing good.  They are so convincing that I couldn't decide whether I wanted them to fail or not. <br />Look for some interesting technological/biological weapons such as the Guardians' &quot;bloodsword&quot; which has five needles in the hilt.  When grasping the hilt, the needles break the skin and a specialized virus is injected into the wielder's bloodstream.  If the swordbearer is not a Guardian, he/she dies soon after.  Else, the Guardian receives enhanced abilities and shielding. <br />Although I haven't yet read books 2 &amp; 3 (King's Test and King's Sacrifice), this was a very strong start to the story. <br />Only difficulty is finding the books as they have been out of print for several years.  Most difficult to locate was book two.	2001-01-12
US	50176211	R2XTYND3VZ6XEL	0380788144	846808479	The Death of the Necromancer	Books	4	36	36	N	N	Interesting mix of genres	Nicolas Valiarde is a thief; but is he a thief with a noble purpose?  His true goal is to discredit and eventually lead a Count to execution in vengeance for the wrongful death of his foster father.  Meanwhile, unexplained deaths are discovered in Vienne--deaths which may have something to do with Nicolas's foster father's experiments into necromancy.<br />Wells's narrative immerses the reader into her world.  The world of Ile-Rien is painstakingly designed and researched, a world not unlike late 19th century Europe.  She invokes all of the senses to realize the ruined noble houses, the depths of the sewers, and the activity of the streets.<br />I can only describe this novel as a mixture of Edgar Allen Poe, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes, with a bit of sorcery thrown in for good measure.<br />Wells reveals hidden information about her characters throughout the novel, thus revealing their motivations and personalities like peeling back an onion.  It's not until the end of the book that the reader sees into their core.<br />I probably would not have picked up this book on my own since I usually read books in the space opera or pure fantasy genres, but this was selected for my SF Book Club.  I'm glad I didn't miss this one.	2001-01-08
US	50176211	R2BTDF7WTOZTVN	055356112X	586154690	Once A Hero: A Novel	Books	3	5	7	N	N	Enjoyable but not the best Stackpole novel	I've read several Stackpole novels, including his X-Wing Star Wars series and Talion: Revenant.  This book, one of his earlier fantasies is good, but the author has definitely grown in his writing style.<br />Once a Hero is very interestingly structured.  In it, Stackpole intertwines events in the fantasy world's current time and similar or relevant events in its past.  This helps reinforce a &quot;theme&quot; which recurs throughout the novel:  Humans think in the short term and the elven folk in the long term.<br />The ending is somewhat predictable, but I enjoyed the journey getting there.<br />For a stronger use of shifting timeframes, read his Talion: Revenant.	2001-01-03

It is written for a more youthful market (ie. King's Daggers instead of the King's Blades), but it dovetails nicely with the other novels.<br />Stalwart, a non-bound Blade, and Emerald, a White Sister-in-training get involved in plots during the Monster War era.  Duncan left this era somewhat vague in the King's Blades novels.  Many characters from the other novels make brief appearances.<br />Don't believe it is necessary to have read the Blades series, but it would help.<br />Characters are clever and the plot is very enjoyable.  Appears that the series will contain at least three books.	2000-12-28

The premise is definitely unique:  a former commando, a long-forgotten Greek goddess, and a technologically-advanced computer inhabit the body of the aforesaid commando.  Three's definitely a crowd when each consciousness wants to go her own way.<br />David Weber certainly maintains a high standard of writing, characterization, and plot in this novel.  Just watch out for those three-tier conversations!!<br />The ending is open enough that a sequel is possible.	2000-12-20
US	50176211	R1X4PBBJVJSF7S	0812517040	664331093	The Price of the Stars: Book One of Mageworlds	Books	5	4	5	N	N	Space Opera and fine adventure	This book was scheduled as one of my SF book club's discussion books.  I wasn't completely enthused about it since I had read Weber's Honor Harrington series (which I enjoyed immensely!) and felt sure that it would  be a knock-off.  Boy was I wrong! <br />This book has fine characterization,  interesting plotlines, and a universe that kept me turning the pages all  night.<br />While I couldn't stop at this first book (Starpilot's Grave and By  Honor Betray'd are books 2+3), this book could be read as a stand-alone for  those who aren't prepared to dive into a multi-book series.<br />As mentioned  in several of the other reviews, this book is reminiscent of the Star Wars  universe with some science fiction elements and a bit of the supernatural.   <br />What appealed most, however, was that the authors built a sense of  history into their universe so that there is a feeling that the crises  recounted here are the result of real historical events.  In addition, the  reader does not have an omniscient view of the action, because many of the  characters do not have a complete understanding.  This made the plot more  realistic.<br />This is definitely a book to put on the &quot;re-read&quot;  shelf.	2000-07-11

Still want to read about SF military training and campaigns?....Try this book.  A definite quick read, but I found it  enjoyable nonetheless.<br />One thing that seemed refreshing was the focus on  ground warfare...flanking, intelligence/counter intelligence, and just  plain luck.  Made the novel tie into current and historical battling (civil  war, vietnam, desert storm).  The projectile-type weapons (few lasers,  etc), however, seemed a little odd for a 29th Century military unit.	2000-07-03
