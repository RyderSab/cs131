He uses letters, unpublished writings, and his own recollections in this biography of his father.  Some of the stories, which James Herriot didn't include in his books as he thought them too outrageous, made me laugh out loud.  The book is touching as well, especially regarding his relationship with his wife.  I appreciate the honesty of the author in that he includes some potentially embarassing material regarding Herriot's health and episodes of mental illness.<br />My one criticism is that I wished the author included less about James Herriot's friends and more about James Herriot himself.	2000-09-28

It explains  how jewelry styles changed throughout the century in an interesting way.   Unfortunately, the photographs weren't as good; they didn't accentuate the  jewels very well and were sometimes slightly out of focus and grainy.  In  the chapter on pink diamonds, many of the photographs make the diamonds  look gray.  Throughout the book, diamonds described as canary yellow look  like white diamonds.  In general, the beauty of the gems were not captured.	2000-09-16

This part could have  been much shorter.  I don't need to know, nor do I care about, Dodi's  favorite pets as a child.<br />The actual part related to the investigation  was an evenhanded treatment of the facts as they were known in 1998.  To  the authors' credit, they investigate the most wild theories in a fair  manner.  When information was not known or available, they plainly state  so.  Unfortunately, they hint darkly a few times in the book that a source  (which they can't name) tells them there is 'something big' not known about  the case.  This shot down the authors' credibility.	2000-09-12

This is the story of how a doctor convicted of poisoning 6 of his  coworkers at an ambulance service managed to get job after job as a  physician.  And how he subsequently murdered up to 60 patients due to the  incompetence, arrogance, and corruption of the medical institutions and  physicians involved.  The laxness of the application and interview process  at some of the most prestigious institutions in the U.S. is exposed.  Every  single time he was suspected of foul play, the institutions involved merely  fired him, without any police involvement.  I was shocked that nurses,  patient family members and patients themselves witnessed Swango's misdeeds,  yet weren't listed to because it was their word against a  physician's.<br />When Swango moved on to kill in small hospitals in Zimbabwe,  police officials were notified almost immediately by suspicious coworkers.   The contrast between the quick action of the medical establishment in bush  areas of Zimbabwe and the lying and covering up of U.S. establishments was  startling.<br />The book tries to answer the question of why Swango killed and  poisoned so many people.  The book really has no conclusion other than he's  a psycopath, which is probably about as good as anyone can understand  this.<br />Swango was sentenced to life in prison yesterday.  This book points  out there may be other Swangos out there and that's really scary.	2000-09-08

The novel starts at one level and just goes on and on  and on at the same level.  There's no real narrative tension and less plot  than your typical novel.  Granted, the focus of the book were the  characters, but the only character who changed substantially was Melony, a  minor character.  The main character did change at the very end, but it was  so predictable as to be laughable.  I had to force myself to read the last  third of the book and was sorry I did because there is no payoff at the  end.	2000-09-08

From the irrelevant title to the declarations of love  seemingly thrown in at random, this book is completely disingenuous.<br />The first half of the book tries to paint Hewitt as a perfect soldier.  The details of his army exploits were extremely boring and his crowning  achievement seems to be a small newspaper mention of his bravery during the  Gulf War.  This part of the book ends when he leaves the army after  receiving two rebukes from his superior officer for leaving base without  permission and having expired tags on his vehicle.  He claims to have been  drummed out of the service, which may in fact be true, but he also  minimizes these violations.<br />The second half of the book is a pity party  for himself because letters from Diana were stolen from his home safe,  apparently by the Mirror newspaper.  I find little sympathy for him  considering Diana asked him to destroy the letters, a fact he himself  mentions several times.	2000-09-08

The writing and character development is of the high standard I expect from  Peter David.

The  author constantly describes the murderer in terms of his bad appearance,  e.g., short, ugly, balding.  It is interesting that almost every other male  in the book is described as being handsome.  Even the biker hitman who  testifies wearing mostly leather is depicted as a 'noble savage'.  The  murderer's daughters on the other hand, as described as blond and almost  angelic in appearance.<br />The author alternately discribes the villain of  the piece as being a bumbling fool or a criminal mastermind, whichever fits  with the point she is currently trying to make.  She doesn't seem to  understand she can't have it both ways.<br />All the facts of the case have  been described by the time the trial takes place, so the last half of the  book is mostly repetition.  I would have rather she delved into some of the  interesting aspects that were briefly mentioned (e.g., cocaine found in the  murder victim, the insurance company's computer system being hacked into)  rather than simply repeating, sometimes word for word, information from  earlier in the book.	2000-08-26

I couldn't find myself caring about what  happened to them.  Usually Rendell is good at making unbelievable  situations believable, but the plot in this novel was that of a second-rate  potboiler.  At the end of the book, I had the feeling, 'is that it?', which  is not my usual reaction to Rendell's works.  A real disappointment.	2000-08-17

Rendell doesn't follow the usual sequence of  crime, investigation, resolution.  There are at least 6 major crimes in  this book, some related, some unrelated, and some 'red-herrings'.  One  major plotline ends halfway through the book and one major plotline starts  3/4 the way through.  You have to marvel at Rendell's expertise in tying  everything together at the end.<br />Rendell is one of the best writers  around...in any genre.	2000-08-12

The appealing part of the novel is the philosophical  consequences of people seeing three minutes of their life 20 years in the  future.  I thoroughly enjoyed the 'news items' at the beginnings of the  chapters.  <br />My problem with the novel is that most of the main characters  are either unlikeable or unremarkable.  I especially found the Theo  character loathesome; I was rooting for the villain to kill him at the end.   The main character was harmless enough, but his finance was annoying.  The  only intriguing character was the 'geeky' scientist who courts the woman  who he saw in his vision of the future (making love in their lab, no  less).<br />The dialogue in this book was somewhat stilted, but it didn't  bother me as much as the characters.	2000-08-12
US	51688790	R2LFJXHNYGFUOS	0061053104	387426853	The Terminal Experiment	Books	3	3	4	N	N	Good ideas, but poor characterization	There were two main ideas in the book:  the philosophical implications of  the discovery of a 'soulwave' that exits the body after death and an AI  experiment that makes three differing copies of a human's brain to  determine what makes up a soul.    The author should have stuck to these  concepts.  <br />The subplot regarding an affair between the protagonist's  wife and a coworker took up far too much of the book.  This subplot did  feed into the main plot, but the point was belabored.  Another subplot  involved the investigation, rather simplistic, of the murders of the  coworker and the wife's father.<br />The dialog in this novel was very  stilted.  For example, when they weren't talking about technical concepts,  the protagonist and his AI friend interacted like teenagers, complete with  obscure Star Trek references.  I found the monologs spouted by the AI  versions of the protagonist to be the best dialog in the novel.	2000-08-12

Is it aliens, a black hole, God ?    After the first couple of interesting chapters, the book changes directions  and becomes a dreadful technomystery.  The are consortiums and convoluted  plans within plans.  I stopped reading about half way through because I  couldn't stand it anymore.  I did thumb to the back to see what the cause  of the bubble was and it was explained in one short throw-away  paragraph.<br />The writing here is simply terrible.

The book was somewhat repetitive, however.<br />My one major  problem with the book is that it didn't explore the husband's culpability  in his children's deaths.  It is inconceivable to me that any responsible  father would leave his children in the care of an unstable woman (he tried  to commit her only three weeks previously) who he knew tried to poison him  previously.  His explanation was he thought she was 'better' and she had  never hurt the children before.  Obviously he was wrong.  It is unbelivable  that not one single person connected to the case pointed out this bizarre  logic.  I think any details on this line of questioning were probably left  out of the book to keep it going towards one angle.  I am afraid for his  surviving daughter.	2000-08-02

However, this is truly Mr. Rees-Jones' story.  Princess Diana is simply portrayed as a pleasant woman who was one of the  party he was to guard.<br />The book tells how Mr. Rees-Jones went from  being bodyguard to a relative unknown to a potential suspect in one of the  most intense investigations of the twentieth century.  The first third of  the book details the prior month or so of his job.  This part demonstrated  the poor security work that often relied on amateurish cloak and dagger  manuevers and that proper security work was thwarted by a fatuous boss.<br />The second third details his recovery from his injuries.  Since he was  unconscious and then medicated for this period, his parents' story was  mostly used here.  I found this the most tedious part of the whole book;  his parents, especially his mother, are simply tiresome and of little  interest to the larger story.  The details of his facial surgeries were  fascinating.<br />The last third concerns the aftermath of being released from  the hospital to the final decision of the judge on the case.  This part was  the most gripping for me.  The machinations of various parties to gain  control of the testimony and newspaper interviews of a man still recovering  from major trauma went so far as to be near-kidnappings.  The conflict of  interest of working for the man who was trying to prove a conspiracy theory  through his testimony was a tense situation.  I felt triumphant for him  when he finally realized he was being manipulated and quit his job.	2000-07-27

There is very little plot and the characters, who were difficult to tell apart, are simply devices to carry out the techical  details.  The author missed a great chance here to explore the  philosophical implications of the technology.  Without knowing anything  about the author, I'd guess he writes technical manuals and this is his  first try at a novel.	2000-07-24

The last 10 chapters are on legal issues, sometimes  not very relevant to homemaking (the author is a lawyer).  The book is  short on information on the major systems of a home, such as electricity,  heat, etc.  Plumbing only rates a two-page chapter that basically says  'call a plumber'.<br />There is an impressive amount of information on air  quality, allergens, food safety and related topics. Almost enough to make a  person really paranoid.<br />I like the author's no-nonsense approach to  cleaning.  At first I thought it was crazy to get on hands and knees to  wash a floor, but I tried it and realized how much ground-in dirt really  was on my floor.  It makes sense that you can see more dirt from 2 ft away  than 5 ft.	2000-06-02

The investigation and clues had no points of interest and seemed unworthy of  Morse's attention. <br />The highlight of the book is the interaction between  Morse and Lewis (who, to my delight, has a much bigger role than usual),  and Morse and Strange.  I was truly touched by Morse's actions  towards  Lewis and Strange at the end of the book.<br />The writing itself was to Colin  Dexter's high standard.  I've always appreciated that he doesn't 'write  down' to the audience.  It was courageous of him to show Morse's abuse of  alcohol and drugs in such a realistic way.<br />I give this book 1 star for  the mystery and 5 stars for everything else.	2000-06-02

One would  have to be a perfect person, both in terms of looks and personality, in  order to be found acceptable by the author.

Leslie Field obviously loves her subject; the amount of research that went into this book is impressive.  It is fascinating to follow a piece of jewelry through history from Queen  Victoria to Princess Diana through pictures.  The accompanying text is  informative, but the pictures really say it all in this book.	1999-08-31

Who else has the guts (besides Dante) to set a main portion of the action of a book in Heaven and Hell.  I  thought she wove the different times and places very well. I'm not usually  surprised by anthing in her books, but something that happened early on in  the book was really unexpected.	1999-07-29

Linda Greenlaw explains the mechanics of fishing very well and there were only a few places where I couldn't imagine what was going on.   At these times, I wished the book had a few pictures or line  drawings.<br />The mood of the book ranges from bone-chilling to hilarious.   In some places, the language is stilted, but it adds to the charm of a work  by an amateur writer.  <br />One thing I really liked about the book is the  fact that Ms. Greenlaw didn't dwell on the fact that she's a woman.  She  gives her thoughts on it for a couple of paragraphs and then there's a few  mentions of her crew's thoughts on it.	1999-06-06

Vampires, witches, ghosts, evil spirits, curses, cannibalism, Egyptian mummies, telepathy, telekinesis.  Just when you thought Anne Rice had crammed just about everything she could into a book, she throws in  feminism.  This book is a spirited attempt to weave what seems to be a  universal theory of all paranormal experience, but unfortunately, it  doesn't all hang together.  <br />The new characters weren't particularly  interesting or well drawn.  As always, Lestat is a fascinating character.   I would have been happy if half of the mumbo-jumbo floating around this  book had been exorcised and more of Lestat put in.<br />Another thing that  annoyed me was the constant, repititious use of 'the twins'.  Yes, we did  get that the twins were at the crux of the story, but was it necessary to  mention them on almost EVERY PAGE?  After a while, it became a joke to turn  the page and scan for those two words.	1999-05-10
US	51688790	R15PTR4349YLGO	0140249532	693550797	Aspects of Aristocracy (Penguin history)	Books	1	11	19	N	N	Mean-spirited fluff	This book claims to be about the decline of the aristocracy, but is really a mean-spirited look at the misfortunes of several aristocratic dynasties and persons.  The author gleefully rips apart Winston Churchill, Lord  Curzon, Vita Sackville-West and others, while adding no new insight into  their characters.  Lord Curzon was obsessed with ceremony?  Now there's a  startling relevation.  <br />There is very little substance to this book and  no conclusions are reached, or even suggested.	1999-05-03

This book takes an often tongue-in-cheek look at alliances between American women seeking respectability marrying English noblemen seeking cash.  The tone of the book is fun and sometimes gossipy, but don't be  fooled.  The background material on the history of England and America in  the late Nineteenth century is worth the price of the book alone.  <br />A  simply fascinating book.	1999-04-06

I had just read Jackie after Jack and was looking forward to this book because I've always been interested in Diana.  This book was a waste of time; there's very little that was new in it.  Knowing that the Royal  family doesn't give interviews, I was very sceptical about some of the  scenes described.<br />I think the author has tarnished his well-earned  reputation for 'Jack and Jackie' and 'Jackie after Jack' with this  book.<br />Diana fans, this is not the book for you!	1999-04-06

I kept getting the feeling I had seen these cartoons before and I don't read the comics in the newspaper, so I know I haven't.  I think Scott must  be repeating himself.<br />The Wally cartoons were great.  More Wally!	1999-04-06
