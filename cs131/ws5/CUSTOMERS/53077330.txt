In fact, at about 120 pages I still wasn't sure I was even enjoying what I was reading. (This is partly affected by the blurb inside the front cover which gives away some plot points, so you are waiting for them to happen as you are reading.) But then, I got sucked in. The book is nothing but the typed thoughts of the main character, but as he gets older, you know more and more about him and his family, and he became a friend I felt I was listening to. The plot of the book could probably be summed up in 5 sentences, so don't read it for plot. Read it if you find you like the author's voice. I found myself genuinely sad at the end of the book.	2005-07-09

So, he spends six months living at a retirement community in Florida to find out what retirement is really like. To tell you more would ruin the book's most interesting plot points (Will he have sex with a senior citizen? Will he ever learn the dark secrets of playing Canasta? Will he ever date a Jewish girl?). <br />I finished this in two evenings, and I suspect you will too. Recommended.	2005-04-27

But the result is quite impressive. The author manages to include words and arguments associated with Wittgenstein, friends and collaborators, and even even entries on modern commentators on Wittgenstein. The author always presents several opinions where they exist, and tells you which opinion is the most commonly held one. Along with excellent advice on how to start reading about Wittgenstein, this is a real winner.	2005-02-22

Wainer's book is accessible to people with a minimal statistical background, with its fascinating voyage through the history of data displays. It provides interesting biographical information on some of the characters we meet along the voyage.

If you like that chapter, chances are you will be delighted with the entire book.     P.S. Another book worth looking for that approaches this topic from a different viewpoint is THE AWAKENED EYE by Ross Parmenter.	2004-12-22

The author has three \\"practice\\" flexagons so you can make mistakes on them, before you create the nicer flexagons Mr. Mitchell has printed with pretty designs on them.

What a treasure!! MATHEMATICIAN'S DELIGHT is more famous, I believe, but this book is filled with wisdom. Sawyer introduces finite geometries and group theory in simple prose. He figures out where Hall and Knight came up with the ideas for some of their exercises in their (famous) HIGHER ALGEBRA text. He introduces the hypergeometric function as a generalization of power series expressions of functions (something I feel I should certainly have heard of before reading about it here.)

I have two copies of the 1961 edition on my paperback shelf since I pick up a copy anytime I see one at a library sale. I got my first copy in sixth grade (true story). There are very few tricks that appear in ANY speed math book that don't also appear in Meyers book. But most of Meyers book is information on what to do in very specific problems (multiplying by 9, multiplying by 36, etc.) Nowadays, people generally want methods that are applicable in a wide variety of situations, not just multiplying by specific numbers.       A good test for one of these books is to see how it deals with division. Division is by far the most difficult operation for kids to learn, and books on speed math are often very short on division methods. Handley's book contains two methods, one of which, as far as I know, only appeared in A. H. Russell's RAPID CALCULATIONS (printed in London, 1956, hard to find.)        Why three stars? The book is very good in teaching what Handley calls the reference number method for multiplication. But I think the average reader would have difficulty following some of the explanations for both division methods. Handley's subtraction method (which he says he was taught in third grade) is excellent - recommended for any parent whose kids are having trouble borrowing. There are other interesting things here(meaning things I have not seen before or not seen in awhile)--an easy way to go from Fanrenheit to Celsius or vice versa, multiplying feet and inches by feet and inches, a quick method for mental square root estimates. But I am not sure the average reader will be able to follow all of Handley's explanations. So, next reviewer, whoever you are, please comment on how easy to follow you found the explanations to be. Maybe I am unnecessarily pessimistic. In any case, despite these reservations, the book is recommended.	2003-12-11

For myself, after reading the other reviews, I found the discussion of Knuth's 3:16 project interesting and not a commercial. (you could work it the other way too: maybe if you buy this book, you DON'T have to buy 3:16).

I picked this up because, though a math teacher, I really don't like Geometry. Never have. This book covers some of what a high school student would need in just a few chapters. So, Why aren't I recommending it to students needing help? Because the author completely skips proofs, which is what most students are having trouble with. It also has no chapter dealing with circles and theorems related to them. What it does cover it covers in a highly interesting and original way (why does a stool have three legs instead of four?). It is also filled with topics not covered in a high school geometry course, but which are very interesting on their own. Given the authors other books' titles, this is perhaps &quot;geometry for electricians and hobbyists&quot;. If you are someone with bad memories of geometry, but you would like to try revisiting it, then this is highly recommended. It would also be a good outside source for students doing well in Geometry but wanting to read about some higher level topics (including 3 - 4 - and higher dimensional geometry.) The book has loads of multiple choice test questions, so you can see how well you are understanding what you are reading, but it has no detailed solutions in the back--just the correct answers. (techinical point: readers should know that the author teaches polar coordinates &quot;backwards&quot; from the way we teach it in Trigonometry. The form is (r, theta), NOT (theta, r).)	2003-08-13

Unless your math background includes calculus and at least an introductory level course in complex analysis, you are not really going to understand what the Riemann Hypothesis says in any deep way. That's just the way it is. (Similar problems exist in any book written about quantum theory, say.) However, I thought the author did a good job of giving a non-mathematical reader a feel for what the hypothesis is with his &quot;addresses in New York&quot; metaphor. The fascination of this book is its introduction to a wide variety of mathematicians who are working on proving the hypothesis and a realistic idea of a) how much time it takes to &quot;do math&quot; and b) the one-mindedness that a problem like this creates in the people who study it. This is a relatively low stress popular math book intended for the general reader who might otherwise never pick up a book about a math problem. I thought the author succeeded in reaching that audience quite well.	2003-08-09

Last word:  entertaining, worth reading.	2000-01-31
US	53077330	R11HDRHCWJVIOL	0671894234	304942529	Federation (Star Trek)	Books	4	2	2	N	N	READ THIS ONE	I am in the process of going back and reading some of the older ST:TOS novels that I a) have nevr read or b)read so long ago that I had forgotten them. This is an excellent melding of the two series without the characters  actually meeting one another. (at the time they originally wrote this  novel, Roddenbery wanted the casts kept separated, I think.) What can I  tell you? Zefram Cochrane, the companion, the eugenics wars, time travel, a  very nasty Data (though not his fault), the Borg , the Preservers. This one  is worth reading.	2000-01-28

Be sure and look  at the name of the person to whom the book is dedicated. You will see that  name again.	2000-01-18

A clever introduction to philosophical issues through examinations of 101 problems, some familiar to readers of  philosophy and some less so. The glossary is fun reading also, though  american readers should be warned that the author does not hold certain  philosophers (wittgenstein, nietzche) in the high esteem that  &quot;we&quot; americans tend to.	2000-01-05

Peter David's Star Trek novels are some of the best of the breed, but it is his Babylon 5 novels where I think he shines the brightest. In particular, he gets into Londo Mollaris head so that you are sure you are  in there too listening to his thoughts. Add the fact that this is based on  a story by Stracynzski, which means it &quot;really&quot; happened and  you've got  a superb winner.	1999-12-07

If you are going to read one of these &quot;change your life through the occult&quot; books, this is the one to look for. It has so many types of information that it is an introduction to the new age all on its own. Let  me know if you have success changing a pack of cards into a time machine.	1999-10-05

I would start with Wittgenstein's  ON CERTAINTY, ironically his &quot;last&quot; work.	1999-07-21

Mounce studied with one of W's literary executors, so it is likely that his interpretation is close to the  &quot;correct&quot; one. Presumes no previous knowledge of philosophy or  logic. All in all a fantastic resource.	1999-04-20

The character has some clever comments on both life and Europe and there is even what I considered to be a happy ending.  Worth reading.	1999-04-12

As a college instructor myself, the politics he deals with rang true. I was mainly impressed, however, with the  thoughts inside this characters head. I often read novels in which I come  across something and think &quot;No man I know would ever think this&quot;,  but I never felt that way here. I didn't like the ending (I thought the  character made a bad choice) but Malamud is under no contract to clear his  endings with me first. A good solid read.	1999-01-22

First of all this is a reprint of a guide that was first published in Britain that does not seem to have been edited for American publication. Secondly, there are mistakes--pick your favorite series and browse and  you'll find some--I did (in the SPACE:1999 section if you must know.) Also,  each show is kind of reviewed but individual episodes are NOT reviewed,  which was not the impression I got from the TV commercial. And there is  even a British series that the channel  shows (MONSTERS) that is not  listed. Now, if you were the sci fi channel, wouldn't you at least make  sure every show that you broadcast was in the book??    Now, I gave the  book 2 stars because it does have an awful lot of info in one convenient  place. Still, I would recommend that anyone interested in this LOOKS at it  first. Don't buy it sight unseen. And remember that british opinions on  series do not always match american  opinions.	1999-01-11

Pangborn's novel Davy falls in the second category. But this collection of his short stories contains some very  memorable stories (I remember the last story in the book even as I write  this and I haven't looked at the book in at least 10 years.)	1998-12-21

Warburton gives simple and accessible introduction to his &quot;top 20&quot; philosophy classics.

The last book I felt was worh the price was COSMIC  TRIGGER volume three. But this is an ok book--compulsively dip-into-able  and containing references and online resources for most entries. Also, the  book seems to summarize where RAW stands on a lot of topics he has written  about before (see Crowley, Leary, Magick, etc.)     Maybe a bit pricey but  I thought it was worth it.	1998-10-16

First, if you want to read this because you have heard the  magician  is based on Aleister Crowley, it's worth reading--The magician Haddo comes  across as a spoiled vengeful little boy who never grew up which seems  pretty accurate based on Crowley's CONFESSIONS. If you don't know anything  about Crowley, this is still a worthwhile read despite being occassionally  dated and having some &quot;idiot moments&quot; (i.e., &quot;Why is the  character doing that? He/She must be an idiot&quot;). The ending is  particularly chilling and caught me by surprise.	1998-08-23

His interest is historical, so the book has a  more &quot;objective &quot; flavor than most books published by Llewellyn.

The ending didn't bother me and didn't seem any more abrupt than the ending for ENGINES OF CREATION. I enjoyed the book, and think it is definitely worth reading if you have enjoyed any of the author's previous works.	1998-05-19

The same thing is true in his Babylon 5 adaptation. Detail that did not appear in the movie, some interesting hints about what will happen to Sheridan, Delenn and their son, the coincidental <BR> similarity betwenn Helen (of Troy ) and Delenn, <BR> and a sure-fire way to out stare anybody. What more could you ask for? One of David's best novels ever.	1998-04-28
