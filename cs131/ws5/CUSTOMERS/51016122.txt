His intent was to show certain general principles that apply to any economy, whether capitalist, socialist or feudal, and to encourage readers to look at economic policies and systems in terms of their incentives, constraints and consequences, as opposed to simply their intentions and goals.  Dr. Sowell has since produced a revised and expanded edition of Basic Economics to include information from more countries in the world, since basic economic principles are not confined to just one country.  As with the first edition, this updated version begins with a simple, yet often misunderstood premise: <br /> <br />\\"Economics is the study of the use of scarce resources which have alternative uses.\\" <br /> <br />Dr. Sowell uses historical and present-day examples to explain the basic economic principles of supply and demand, the role of prices, free-market competition, investment and risk, the role of business and government, absolute and comparative advantage, present value, and international trade.  This revised and expanded edition improves upon the original in enabling the reader to understand basic economic principles by showing what happens in their absence.  The former Soviet Union, a region of the world rich in natural resources and, thus, enormous economic potential, serves as a useful case study of the disastrous long-term consequences wrought by a centrally planned (as opposed to a free-market) economy. <br /> <br />This updated version also discusses the economic history of India, examining the crippling consequences of that government's failed economic policies over many decades.  Finally realizing the error of its ways, only during the last decade of the twentieth century did India's government finally decide to embrace free markets by instituting sweeping economic reforms, including selling off its state-owned enterprises and removing price controls and international trade restrictions.  The same is true for many countries in Latin America. <br /> <br />Speaking of international trade, Dr. Sowell explains why predictions that \\"a giant sucking sound\\" would accompany American jobs moving to Mexico in the wake of the North American Free Trade Agreement of 1993 (NAFTA) never came to past.  I am not sure what sound goes with an increase in American jobs, including over 100,000 jobs created in the automobile industry over a six-year period, but that is exactly what happened after NAFTA went into effect.  As the author points out, this should not have surprised anyone with a basic understanding of economics.  International trade is not a zero-sum game; nations trade with each other because both parties expect to benefit. <br /> <br />Distinguishing between incentives and goals is particularly important when examining the political incentives of government officials.  Dr. Sowell shows that most politically motivated decisions are not only devoid of even a basic understanding of economics, but can also lead to consequences far worse than either doing something \\"less popular\\" or doing nothing at all.  Dr. Sowell provides a more in-depth discussion of the distinction between political and economic decision-making in his follow-up book, Applied Economics: Thinking Beyond Stage One.  <br /> <br />Along with a more international emphasis, this updated version discusses the economic implications of events that have taken place since publication of the original version.  For example, California's rolling blackouts in 2001 should serve as a painful lesson of the dangers of price controls.  Arguably the most poignant passage in this book deals with the most important investment that anyone can ever make - though not necessarily in stocks, bonds, gold or mutual funds.  Dr. Sowell explains: <br /> <br />\\"One of the largest investments in many people's lives consists of the time and energy expended over a period of years in raising their children.  At one time, the return on that investment included having the children take care of the parents in old age, but today the return on this investment often consists only of the parents' satisfaction in seeing their children's well-being and progress.  From the standpoint of society as a whole, each generation that makes this investment in its offspring is repaying the investment that was made by the previous generation in raising those who are parents today.\\" <br /> <br />This book is a must-read for any person desiring to be better informed.  As one of the most brilliant public intellectuals of our time, Thomas Sowell is in a class all his own. <br />	2005-01-11

I've been a fan of professional wrestling since I was a kid, and some of my fondest wrestling memories involve the Nature Boy. This book details the life of, in my opinion, the greatest professional wrestling performer of all time (yes, greater than even Hulk Hogan). I just could not put it down! <br />  <br /> I was mesmerized at Flair's account of all of the old-timers who had helped to mold and shape his career, such as Wahood McDanial, Verne Gagne, Johnnie Valentine, Harley Race, and Blackjack Mulligan. Like other wresters during that time, Flair lived a wild life in his younger days, as he relives in sometimes painful detail. I really respect him for owning up to all of his mistakes and bad choices and how he has learned from all of them, as this only proves that he is a human being. <br />  <br /> It was pretty sad to read about how former WCW officials like Jim Herd and Eris Bischoff went out of their way seemingly to make Flair's life as miserable as they could .Given that during Flair's legal troubles with WCW in 1998, Bischoff's pledge in front of other wrestlers that he was going to &quot;sue Flair and his family into bankruptcy,&quot; as well as numerous other personal and professional slights, I can see why Flair hates the man's guts. It was gratifying to read how Flair got a little &quot;payback&quot; shortly after Bischoff arrived in the WWE in 2002. <br />  <br /> For professional wrestling fans, this book is a must-read.	2004-07-26

Orator Edward Everett kept a crowd hanging on his every word during his three-hour speech (yes, three hours!) at Gettysburg in 1863 because he was an excellent orator in a time when American society valued excellent orators.  Even during the first half of the 20th century, a command of spoken and written English on a level that today would confound many college students was not only required by the time one finished the eighth grade, but was the social norm; ain't so anymore.<br />In Doing Our Own Thing: The Degradation of Language and Music and Why We Should, Like, Care, John McWhorter examines this cultural decline in the use of high-fallutin English in contemporary America.  He shows that people were taught from grade school, whether or not they went on for higher education, to always put the English language in its Sunday best.  W.E.B. Du Bois stands out in particular.  Du Bois's first assignment in a composition class at Harvard in 1890 was to write about himself.  This is what he wrote:<br />\\"For the usual purposes of identification I have been labeled in this life: William Edward Burghardt Du Bois, born in Great Barrington, Massachusetts, on the day after Washington's birthday, in 1868.  I shall room during the present twelve-month at number twenty Flagg Street, Cambridge.  As to who I really am, I am much in doubt, and can consequently give little reliable information from casual hints and observations.  I doubt not that there are many who could supply better data than the writer.  In the midst then of personal uncertainty I can only supply a few alleged facts from memory according to the usual way.\\"<br />And if that's not enough, he finishes with this closing linguistic zinger:<br />\\"I have something to say to the world and I have taken English twelve in order to say it well.\\"<br />This example speaks volumes about the cultural currency that a high command of English possessed back then, and which no longer exists.  Can you imagine anyone writing or speaking like this today and not be viewed as pretentious, arrogant or just plain uppity?  What happened to cause American society to no longer value such an elevated command of our language? <br />The authors shows that the 1960's, which scorned the American Establishment as oppressive and constricting, also caused modern-day America to view the highly stylized English of earlier generations as old-fashioned and morally suspect - hence the linguistic shift from the formal to the informal.  Americans of an earlier time went out of their way to write and speak good English, and the gap between written and spoken English was indeed wide.  The 1960's (McWhorter puts it around 1965 exactly) changed all that.  Now, we just talk - and we write how we talk.  Using dressed-up English is just so \\"old school.\\"  This counter-cultural revolution is also reflected in poetry, music and journalism.  Furthermore, the author points our how this phenomenon is uniquely American: we just do not love our own language today like other countries love theirs (most notably France).<br />What new American dialect, then, best embodies this new linguistic counter-cultural paradigm?  Why, Black English, of course.  McWhorter points out how Americans of all stripes since the 1960's have incorporated Black English and its accompanying body language and vocal cadence into this counter-cultural toolkit.  By no means criticizing Black English, he devotes considerable space in chapter five analyzing the cultural meaning of the 1970's funk music hit \\"Play That Funky Music, White Boy.\\"  For the P.C. crowd, try to tell a white guy to \\"Perform with spiritual dedication the bewitchingly vernacular songs familiar to us, young Caucasian male,\\" and see how far that gets you.   <br />Although the author points out that the natural evolution of language in itself is not necessarily a bad thing, as all world languages evolve, he does point out some important drawbacks to the modern-day tendency to \\"dress down\\" English.   This can be seen particularly in the modern education establishment, where the emphasis on the formal language acquisition of earlier generations has been all but tossed out the window.  This does not bode well for anyone, but it is particularly damaging to black and immigrant schoolchildren.  <br />McWhorter covers a lot of ground in Doing Our Own Thing, giving the reader plenty to chew on.  It is a fascinating look into how the 1960's transformed American society from one that spoke the language and held it in high esteem to one in which people just talk.  Regrettably, it looks as if this trend in linguistic informality (some would call it pure laziness) will continue.	2004-07-13

On the one hand, here's a guy who became a gang-banger, thug and all-around menace to society, eventually serving time in prison for armed robbery, but eventually got on the right track and is now a reporter for the Washington Post.  Good story.  When I first read the book I was impressed.  Not anymore.<br />McCall describes a life growing up in a solid, lower-middle-class family.  In his early teens, he joined a gang.  Soon, he participated in the gang-rape of a young girl.  Eventually, he graduated to burglaries, holdups and gang fights, shooting a loaded pistol at unarmed teens.  His political conscience awakened by the Black Panthers, which ultimately led to his racist hatred for white people, which he uses as justification for the barbaric acts perpetrated by him and others against whites.  For example, he once fired a sawed-off shotgun into the suburban home of a white family watching TV, and then ran off without knowing (or, apparently, caring) whether anyone was hit.  <br />Instead of taking responsibility for his actions, admitting to his mistakes, and trying to warn impressionable young black men NOT to make the same mistakes that he made, McCall tries to show that it was &quot;racism&quot; that caused him to make the choices he made.  By the end of the book, it seems he wants to reader to be impressed with his generous decision to &quot;forgive&quot; white people.  Forgive them for what?  What did &quot;Whitey&quot; ever to do him to make him become a gang-banging, gang-rapist thug?  How did that white suburban family provoke him into firing a sawed-off shotgun into their home, possibly seriously injuring (if not killing!) someone inside?<br />It is obvious that McCall was an angry young man.  However, instead of delving into the real sources of his anger and dealing with it in a constructive way, he uses his anger, as well as his racism (let's call a spade a spade) to justify his criminal past.  <br/>Negro, Pu-LEEEZE!<br />I would have had more respect for him had he just owned up to his mistakes, as opposed to trying to justify his actions via &quot;Whitey.&quot;  &quot;Makes Me Wonna Holler&quot; makes me wonna scream.	2004-05-13

Looking at public policy decisions simply from the perspective of the former prevents us from preventing many \\"unintended\\" consequences - which, from the perspective of the latter, would have been foreseeable by simply taking the necessary time and effort to look beyond stage one.<br />This is the premise of Thomas Sowell's new book, Applied Economics: Thinking Beyond Stage One (Basic Books, 2004).  In this follow-up to his 2000 book Basic Economics, where he lays the foundation for understanding economic principles by explaining them in layman's terms, Dr. Sowell applies these principles to real-world case studies to explain how and why things have happened the way that they have.   He examines the long-term economic consequences of many politically popular decisions motivated by what he calls \\"stage-one thinking.\\"  <br />Consider the following example to raise taxes on corporations located in a city or state to finance government projects:<br />State One:  Such a decision might win political points for the mayor or governor, and may even increase his/her chances for re-election.  <br />Stage Two: The headquarters of corporations hit by the higher taxes may decide to shift production to places where taxes are lower, thereby reducing the locally earned income on which taxes are paid by both the corporations and their local employees.<br />Stage Three: As corporations grow over time, they will locate in places where taxes are lower, transferring employees willing to move and replacing those who are not by hiring new people.<br />Stage Four: Eventually, the corporate exodus from the high-tax city or state will cause total tax revenues to be less thanwhat they were before the tax increase.  Yet, by this time years will have passed and the politicians responsible for the increase will probably escape the political consequences of their decisions.<br />Citing New York City - which has the highest tax rate of any city in the country - as an example, the author wittingly puts it, \\"... killing the goose the lays the golden egg is a viable political strategy, so long as the goose does not die before the next election and no one traces the politician's fingerprints on the murder weapon.\\"  This is classic stage-one thinking at work.<br />Price controls are very popular politically, but their negative consequences, though well documented, are never taken into account by those who do not think beyond stage one.  Dr. Sowell cites the government-controlled health care systems of Japan, Korea, France, Britain, and Canada, and looks at the consequences of land use restrictions and rent control policies in the state of California to drive home this point.<br />In the chapter on \\"the Economics of Discrimination,\\" Dr. Sowell discusses the actual costs of discrimination and the incentives and constraints that drive those costs.  To give a concrete example, the late Cincinnati Reds baseball team owner Marge Schott was known to espouse racist beliefs - and often expressed them publicly to the consternation of baseball officials and everyone else within earshot.  However, she was also a shrewd businesswoman who knew that, no matter what her personal feelings about blacks were, not hiring star black baseball players would have been financial suicide.  She may have been a bigot, but from a business perspective she wasn't stupid.<br />The last chapter discusses how a nation's economic development is the result of a whole host of historical, political and geographic factors, showing how and why different parts of the world have developed differently over time, with no given factor explaining the large economic disparities between the world's countries and societies.  People who desire simple and emotionally satisfying explanations for such disparities based on melodramatic \\"exploitation\\" theories, would be well served to pay close attention.<br />Whereas Basic Economics lays the foundation for understanding economic principles, Applied Economics puts those principles in action in the real world.  It is too bad that more of our nation's intellectuals and decision-makers do not live in the real world.  Fortunately, Thomas Sowell does, which makes our world all the better for it.	2004-05-04

Affirmative action has been arguably the most politically divisive topic in the post-Civil Rights era.  President John F. Kennedy originally coined the phrase in an executive order to eliminate discrimination - past and present and primarily suffered by blacks - based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.  In concept, the initial rationale was based on the idea that the affirmative action policies would be temporary and limited in scope.  In practice, however, they have expanded into a pervasive system of goals, timetables and numerical quotas to include other \\"aggrieved groups\\", and which over the years have done more harm than good.  This phenomenon is not unique to the United States.<br />In Affirmative Action Around the World: An Empirical Study (Yale University Press, 2004), Thomas Sowell takes a global view in examining group preference polices in the U.S., India, Malaysia, Sri Lanka, and Nigeria.  Whether called affirmative action in America, \\"positive discrimination\\" in India, preferences \\"reflecting the federal character of the country\\" in Nigeria, or \\"sons of the soil\\" preferences in Malaysia, Dr. Sowell looks at the similarities in the rationale behind the policies of these aforementioned countries, as well as their actual consequences.<br />One of the most damaging results of affirmative action in American higher education is the abysmal graduation rate of minority students admitted to elite colleges and universities under lower admissions standards.  What makes this phenomenon even more disheartening is that many of these students would be perfectly suited to succeed at academically less rigorous schools, yet are \\"pervasively mismatched\\" into schools for which they are not adequately prepared, thus almost guaranteeing their chances of failure.<br />Dr. Sowell shows how the notions, rationales and assertions supporting affirmative action are widely accepted without being tested empirically.  When they are put to the test, they usually do not pass muster, and the mounting evidence of their negative consequences is either suppressed or altogether ignored.<br />Any citizen desiring an objective, unvarnished understanding of affirmative action would be served well by reading this book.  Whereas much has been written and said about the idealistic goals of preferential policies, Dr. Sowell sheds much-needed light on their actual consequences, in the United States and around the world.do not pass muster, and the mounting evidence of their negative consequences is either suppressed or altogether ignored.   <br />Any citizen desiring an objective, unvarnished understanding of affirmative action would be served well by reading this book.

What is particularly refreshing about this book is its non-conformist tone: the essayists are strong-willed people who do not need the \\"acceptance\\" of their liberal black peers - or the black community as a whole for that matter! - and who are not afraid to openly challenge today's black so-called \\"leadership.\\"  Furthermore, they have logic, objectivity, erudtion and empirical facts on their side, something most black liberals are sorely lacking. <br />This is a great piece of work, and I highly recommend it.	2004-01-20

Look no further than the 1960's War on Poverty programs of the LBJ administration, which instead of \\"winning\\" the war on poverty, only served to exacerbate the plight of the poor, creating three generations of dependence, laziness, irresponsibility and psychological nihilism - a cycle that has only started to be undone with the Welfare Reform Act of 1996.<br />But don't take my word for it.  Just ask Star Parker, president and founder of the Coalition of Urban Renewal and Education (CURE) and self-proclaimed \\"former welfare queen.\\"  Picking up where she left off in her blisteringly honest memoir Pimps, Whores and Welfare Brats (Pocket Star, 1997), Parker takes big government to task in Uncle Sam's Plantation: How Big Government Enslaves America's Poor and What We Can Do About It (WND Books).  If there is anyone who knows first hand the degradation and moral bankruptcy that comes with perennial dependence on \\"Uncle Sam,\\" it's Ms. Parker - she lived it.<br />The author lays out her own categorical definitions of poverty and recounts the hard lessons she learned as a welfare mother.  In discussing how liberals have hijacked history and used the poor as pawns for political purposes, Parker describes the typical government safety net as simply a way of covering up the social pathologies associated with the bad choices of the underprivileged.<br />Arguably the most harmful effects of massive government intervention have been the breakdown of the family unit.  This is especially true in the black community, where according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services roughly 70% of black children are born out of wedlock.  According to Parker, radical feminism has helped to produce this horrible state of affairs.   The author shows in surgical detail how buying into the radical feminist party line (i.e. that men are \\"the enemy,\\" marriage is \\"prostitution and slavery in a different form,\\" and \\"money is power\\") has not only contributed to high rates of illegitimacy and abortion in the black community, but has also rendered many black women \\"unpaid whores and old maids.\\"  <br />The last third of Uncle Sam's Plantation outlines the author's proposed solutions on weaning the poor off of government dependence and liberal mind control.  From analyzing the wastefulness of our current tax system and the counter-productive economic effects of minimum wage and rent control laws, to outlining how Social Security can (and should) be privatized to benefit all those who pay into it, the author displays erudition far beyond the average layperson and an iron-clad compassion born out of the experience of a woman who has indeed \\"been there, done that.\\"   <br />Star Parker's life is a shining example that individual freedom and self-reliance are indeed possible for those who desire and are willing to work for it.  A person's income does not determine his/her outcome, and those desiring a better outcome for their lives should heed this extraordinary woman's words of redemption and deliverance.  She is a true inspiration, and this book is a great read.	2003-12-30

In the early 20th century, Booker T.Washington had a premonition:<br />\\"There is another class of coloured people who make a business of keeping the troubles, the wrongs, and the hardships of the Negro race before the public.  Having learned that they are able to make a living out of their troubles, they have grown into the settled habit of advertising their wrongs - partly because they want sympathy and partly because it pays.  Some of these people do not want the Negro to lose their grievances, because they do not want to lose their jobs.\\"<br />Sounds like Jesse Jackson, Al Sharpton, Maxine Waters, and Louis Farrakhan to me.<br />Thus opens the Rev. Jesse Lee Peterson's new book, \\"SCAM: How the Black Leadership Exploits Black America\\" (WND Books, 2003).  Peterson, founder and president of the Brotherhood Organization of A New Destiny (BOND) and author of \\"From Rage to Responsibility,\\" lays into the modern day civil rights establishment in ways that would make even Rush Limbaugh wince.  He shows the ways in which this \\"other class of coloured people\\" profits from black misery and racial strife just as Booker T. Washington described almost a century ago.  In exposing modern day black \\"leadership\\" for what it truly is, the author's main thesis is that the problems of the black community are due to a lack of moral character and not racism. In other words, we no longer need leaders - we need change. <br />Peterson devotes an entire chapter on the abysmal failing of the NAACP and why that organization should be boycotted, showing how \\"the nation's oldest and largest civil rights organization\\" is completely out of step with the needs of black America.  Over 90% of black homicides in America are committed by other blacks, but instead of addressing the root causes of black-on-black crime, the NAACP absurdly blames gun manufacturers.  The average black public high school graduate has in reality only an eighth-grade education, yet the NAAPC vehemently opposes school choice -a policy overwhelming supported by black parents.  Over 70% of black babies in America are born out of wedlock, yet Julian Bond and Kweisi Mfume would prefer to tackle \\"more important\\" issues - such as the supposed lack of minorities on popular television shows.  Peterson sums up his critique by concluding \\"If the NAACP were truly concerned about black issues, it would focus most of its attention on black-on-black crime, restoring morality in black men, and supporting policies that strengthen black families... But as these moves would increase the real-world welfare of blacks... the NAACP wants nothing to do with them.\\"  Ouch!<br />\\"SCAM\\" addresses how the fear of publicly being labeled \\"racist\\" causes many whites to hold their tongues when they see things run amuck in the black community (yet black liberals are given virtual carte blanche to publicly spew all manner of invective at whites and/or black conservatives).   This fear prevents Americans from engaging in honest dialogue about race (think of the recent fallout over Rush Limbaugh's comments about NFL quarterback Donovan McNabb and you'll get the idea), and serves the interests of self-appointed black \\"leaders\\" and their liberal white sympathizers.  As the average white person would rather be labeled a child molester than a racist, Peterson urges whites to no longer fall prey to such psychological bullying.  (To wit, there is nothing wrong with the word \\"niggardly.\\")<br />BOND puts on the annual National Day of Repudiation of Jesse Jackson, so it is no surprise that the author saves the lion's share of his venom for the self-proclaimed \\"heir-apparent\\" to Dr. Martin Luther King.  Citing investigative reporter Kenneth Timmerman's best-selling tell-all \\"Shakedown\\" (I still can't believe Jackson was brazen enough to take his pregnant mistress with him to the White House for a photo-op with then-President Clinton!), Peterson rips into this improperly ordained minister like a buzz saw.  The author also discusseswhy he is presently suing Jackson and his associates for an alleged assault in December 2001 in Los Angeles.  Peterson is not afraid to publicly challenge the black establishment, sometimes at considerable risk to his own safety.<br />To be sure, \\"SCAM\\" is more than just a stinging indictment against the modern-day civil rights establishment.  The book is also a critically compassionate look at what is really plaguing the black community, in particular the plight of the black family, and what can and must be done to reverse the downward spiral in which many black men, women, and children find themselves.  Peterson's concluding ten-point plan on how the black community can truly realize its full potential and achieve true spiritual freedom is worth of a full-length book in and of itself.	2003-11-04

In cities and suburbs across America, the average black high school graduate possesses the same reading, writing and mathematical competence of an eighth-grader - with Hispanic students not too far behind.  This gap in academic achievement between black and Hispanic students and their white and Asian counterparts is the central civil rights issue of our time.  If nothing is done to close it, true racial equality as Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. envisioned it, will only be just that - a dream.  <br />Such is the premise behind Stephan and Abigail Thernstrom's new book, &quot;No Excuses: Closing the Racial Gap in Learning.&quot;  The authors of &quot;America in Black and White&quot; rely primarily on data from the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), often referred to as \\"the nation's report card,\\" in analyzing the academic underachievement of black and Hispanic students.  Although an alarming number of all American students are leaving high school with what the NAEP deems Below Basic skills, the Thernstroms show that the numbers for blacks and Latinos are abysmally frightening.  In particular, a majority of black students perform Below Basic in five of the seven subjects tested: reading, mathematics, science, writing, U.S. history, civics, and geography.  <br />The authors visited handful of what they call \\"break-the-mold\\" schools - schools that are doing wonders in providing inner-city black and Hispanic students with a quality education, and have the high test scores to prove it.  These little pockets of superb education provide non-stop learning through longer school days, weeks and years, and share a common thread:  they are free from the many bureaucratic constraints that stifle educational reform in today's big-city public schools.  Furthermore, the teachers and administrators of these maverick schools inform students and parents at the outset that nothing less than high academic and behavioral standards will be accepted; in other words, \\"no excuses.\\"<br />When it comes to academic success, the authors argue that culture is very important, and spend three chapters analyzing the cultural influences of Asians, Hispanics and African-Americans on educational achievement.  The main reason that Asian students by and large are academic wunderkinds is because their parents expect nothing less.  The Hispanic experience mirrors that of early 20th Italian immigrants, the authors point out.  However, the cultural and demographic reasons for why Latino children academically underperform do not let schools off the hook.  Black academic underachievement is discussed at length, and the authors have identified some apparent risk factors.  (Although the Thernstroms do give plausible reasons for black underachievement, arguably the best analysis to date of the adverse effects of modern-day black American culture on academic achievement, particularly in middle-class suburban schools, is John McWhorter's &quot;Losing the Race: Self-Sabotage in Black America.&quot;) <br />The Thernstroms take on conventional wisdom regarding the racial gap in learning; namely, that underperforming schools just need more money and smaller class sizes, should be more \\"racially balanced,\\" and should hire more minority teachers.  The authors show that these excuses do not explain the racial academic achievement gap, and pandering to them will neither improve public schools nor solve the problem of underachieving black and Hispanic students.  <br />The authors also outline how Title I and Head Start have been a dismal failure since their inception.  As education secretary Rod Paige aptly put it, \\"After spending $125 billion of Title I money over 25 years, we have virtually nothing to show for it.\\"  Also looked at is the No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB) signed by President Bush in 2001.  The final chapter of the book analyzes the many bureaucratic obstacles that prevent true educational reform, not the least of which is how good teachers are (not) rewarded, the inability of superintendents to bring about change, and, of course, the teachers' unions.<br />For far too long, black and Hispanic academic underachievement has been a taboo subject, shamefully ignored by civil rights leaders, the media, and even academia.  &quot;No Excuses&quot; forces us to not only examine this issue head on, but work to reverse this horrible trend before yet another generation of young blacks and Hispanics are crippled into a permanent underclass.  The Thernstroms have shown that they care deeply about our children's future.  For all others concerned, reading this book is a good first step in bringing about change.	2003-10-21

As a product of Cleveland's public school system, I can attest to its dismal state of affairs.<br />To say that poor, inner-city students in Cleveland were not receiving a quality education would be like saying that Michael Jordan is good at basketball.  The school district did not meet any of the 18 performance standards set for it, and only one in ten 9th graders could pass a basic proficiency exam.  In 1995, three years after I graduated from high school, a federal judge placed the school district in state receivership.  <br />The Ohio state legislature subsequently enacted the Cleveland Scholarship Program to provide scholarships and tutoring assistance to children residing in the Cleveland City School District.  The program allows both private and public schools in adjacent districts to accept scholarship students by lottery, with low-income students receiving priority if the number of applicants supercedes the number of scholarships, while participating schools agree not to discriminate on the basic of race, religion, or ethnic background. <br />In Zelman v. Simmons-Harris, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld Cleveland's scholarship program, giving a huge victory to poor students longing for a quality education and poor parents who want them to have a chance at a better future.  Attorney Clint Bolick and his outstanding legal team helped to make school choice a legal sanctioned reality.<br />In &quot;Voucher Wars,&quot; Bolick recounts his 12-year roller coaster ride to give disadvantaged schoolchildren a chance at a better future.  That struggle began with the nation's first school choice program in Milwaukee, Wisconsin in 1990 and culminated with the 2002 Supreme Court decision in Zelman.  He shows how the teachers' unions time and again threw up legal challenges to oppose school choice even though most union members enroll their own children in private schools.<br />Bolick notes that the Ohio federal court injunction against the Cleveland scholarship program thatwas overturned by the Supreme Court would have snatched 4,000 scholarship students out of quality charter and magnet schools and placed them back into failing public schools before the 1999-2000 school year began.  He calls the teachers' union support for the injunction \\"a strategic miscalculation of titanic significance.\\"   <br />The High Court's ruling was a big thumb to the eye of school choice opponents - most notably the politically powerful National Education Association and the American Federation of Teachers.  They still seem willing to condemn poor - and mostly minority - children to educational cesspools just to maintain their status quo stranglehold on public education.<br />While Bolick points out there is still much more to be done, this books tells an emotional and uplifting story of a high-stakes battle that he helped to win.  It is an excellent read.	2003-09-24

One particular example of this that really struck me is when the author describes why men who physically abuse their live-in girlfriends or common-law spouses attempt suicide:<br />1.  To induce the girlfriend to call an ambulance rather than the police;<BR>2.  To warn her not to leave him because he might kill himself, thus applying extreme emotional blackmail on the battered woman; and<BR>3.  To present themselves as victims of their own abusive behavior - and therefore not responsible for it - and in need of treatment.<BR>(It doesn't help that in most cases the battered women almost never leave their abusive significant others, and will always forgive and forget after the man \\"promises\\" never to do it again.)<br />Compounding the underclass way of life in Britain are the ideas developed and propogated by Britain's liberal intelligensia which support it.  To quote the author: \\"The intellectual's struggle to deny the obvious is never more desperate than when reality is unpleasant and at variance with his preconceptions and when full acknowledgement of it would undermine the foundations of his intellectual worldview.\\"  Dalrymple examines the mental mechanisms of the liberal elite as pertaining to the underclass as follows:<br />1.  Outright denial (e.g. \\"It's not so much that crime is increasing as people's willingness or ability to report it...\\");<BR>2.  Historical comparisons with periods hundreds of years ago as opposed to thirty, or even ten years ago (e.g. \\"Violence and vulgarity have ALWAYS been a part of modern British life.\\");<BR>3.  Once intellectuals begrudgingly admit the facts, they immediately deny or pervert their moral significance (e.g. \\"Vulgarity is liberty from unhealthy and psychologically deforming inhibition,... those who oppose it are elitist...\\"). <br />Furthermore, as the author explains, liberal elites are knee-jerk quick to blame the plight of the British underclass on the \\"elitist, bourgeouis, establishment society\\" from which it was supposedly spawned, viewing underclass pathology as a kind of rebellious self-expressiveness against upperclass culture.  Again, personal responsibility does not enter into the equation.<br />In his own review of the book, Thomas Sowell said it best that \\"The fact that the setting is a white underclass community in Britain may enable some people to see and acknowledge a pattern of self-destruction that they may be reluctant to acknowledge in America, for fear of being considered racist.\\"  I couldn't agree more.	2003-09-08

As a child, the greatest gift my dear-departed mother ever gave me was an appreciation of the value of an education.  As one of six children, this appreciation helped me rise from our poor surroundings in inner city Cleveland to become the successful black professional that I am today.<br />Heeding this lesson, however, was also the genesis of years of verbal abuse, ostracism and criticism I was forced to endure from other black people from elementary school through graduate school.  During these years, I was accused by my black brethren of \\"acting white\\" for using correct English, making good grades and having a sincere love of learning for learning's sake.<br />I could not understand why this happened until I read John McWhorter's 2000 book \\"Losing the Race: Self-Sabotage in Black America.\\"  To quote John 9:25, \\"Where once I was blind, now I see.\\"<br />Professor McWhorter outlines in surgical detail three aspects of modern day black American cultural mentality, or \\"cults,\\" that hold us back as a people.  First is the Cult of Victimology.  In it, victimhood is not seen as a problem to be overcome but an identity to be nurtured.  In the Cult of Separatism, the uniqueness of our history is used as a justification to exempt us from the rules that govern the rest of American society.  Lastly, in the Cult of Anti-Intellectualism, an affinity toward education is seen as running counter to an \\"authentic\\" black identity.<br />The anti-intellectualism cult really hit home with me, and McWhorter's book let me know that I was not the problem.<br />All of this reminds me of an experience from graduate school.  While enrolled at Carnegie Mellon University, I always actively and enthusiastically engaged in my own learning process: asking questions and engaging professors and other students on various topics.  One of my fellow graduate students, a black woman from New York City, felt it necessary to talk to me about my behavior.<br />I was told of her concern that white studentsin our program who hadn't grown up around blacks and who were not used to being around \\"intelligent, articulate black men\\" like me would be \\"intimidated.\\"  She felt they might try to use that against me in the future.  In other words, white students might discriminate against me because of my love of scholarship!  Thus, she advised, I should basically tone down my intellectual zeal.<br />I never forgot that conversation.  After reading \\"Losing the Race\\" two years later, I realized that this woman's \\"concern\\" for my well-being was merely her own anti-intellectual attitude toward me cloaked à la \\"whitey.\\"  In other words, this culturally (and thus, authentically) \\"down\\" sister from Brooklyn was dumping her own academic insecurity on me through the specter of supposedly socially ignorant white students who would supposedly retaliate against me for supposedly making them feel mentally inadequate. []<br />Losing the Race opened my eyes to the three cancerous aspects of black American cultural groupthink.  It also re-ignited the love of learning that my mother instilled in me as a child.  That love, as well as a faith in God, enabled this poor boy from Cleveland to become his high school valedictorian, become his family's first college graduate, earn a master's degree in public policy and management and ultimately become a U.S. Foreign Service Officer.<br />My life has taught me that education is arguably the most important means to achieving professional success and economic independence.  There is no way I would sacrifice that just to gain the myopically fleeting acceptance of my \\"peers.\\"  This is a race that I plan to win.  <br />John McWhorter has rendered a scholarly and tremendously bold contribution to the discussion on contemporary American race relations.  People like himself, Shelby Steele, and Thomas Sowell are not sellouts or traitors by any means; they are heroes.	2003-08-08

Stephan and Abigail Thernstrom's book is the most comprehensive survey of American race relations that I have ever read. The authors present important new information about the positive changes and improvements in the lives of African-Americans as a whole. They go on to argue, with tons of statistics to back them up, that the perception of serious racial divisions in our country are outdated, exaggerated, and dangerous. The reason for this, they show, is political: \\"it nurtures the mix of black anger and white shame and guilt that sustains the race-based social policies implemented since the late 1960s.\\" Proponents of this status quo are afraid that calling attention, for example, to the rapidly-growing black middle class, \\"... would invite public complacency and undercut support for the affirmative action regime.\\"<br />I was especially enthralled by the authors' analysis of the \\"War on Poverty\\" programs of the 1960's, particularly the expansion of welfare, and their horrifically negative effects on generations of black families since.  Not only did the \\"War on Poverty\\" make things worse for the poor, but the expansion of welfare to include unwed women and children fostered a lifestyle of dependency and irresponsible behavior, and precipitated the downward trend in two-parent black families, that has left three generations of black Americans in dire straits ever since.  <br />Liberals, especially black liberals, are terrified of books like this, and rightfully so.  This book undercuts the blacks-as-perennial-victims/American-society-as-forever-racist rhetoric that keeps the Jesse Jacksons and Al Sharptons, with support from the liberal media, in business.  Along with the works of John McWhorter, Shelby Steele and Thomas Sowell, this books serves as a much-needed wake-up call on the issue of race; a cold dose of reality that no doubt makes most liberals cringe.	2003-07-25

In \\"The Burden of Bad Ideas,\\" Heather Mac Donald blows the lid off of what she terms \\"an inflexible ideology that prevents [writers, journalists and commentators] from seeing clearly the reality in front of their eyes, if it doesn't square with theory.\\"  This ideology has informed many social policies intended to help the poor, but in fact have done more harm than good.  Part of the reason that such ideas are so popular, particularly among the liberal elite, is because it makes those who espouse them \\"feel good\\" (i.e. compassionate, caring, concerned about the less fortunate and downtrodden).  These \\"bad ideas\\" consist of the following:<br />1. Poor people cannot be held responsible for their own behavior, because they are victims of an unjust and racist American society;<BR>2. Government can assume the role of parents;<BR>3. America's iradicable racism and sexism requires double-standards for minorities;<BR>4. Reason is a tool of male oppression; and<BR>5. Education is not about knowledge but ethnic empowerment.<br />Mac Donald shows in case after case where these ideas have not only flopped when put into action, but more importantly how they have simply made things worse.  In particular, the author shows how the media (so as not to \\"stigmatize the poor\\") do all they can to cover up the bad choices and irresponsible behavior of welfare recipients that got them on the dole in the first place, treating their current problems as the product of \\"malign social forces and callous Republican policies.\\"  This results in a serious disconnect between the actual causes of poverty and the so-called \\"solutions\\" espoused by the liberal elite.  Not holding people responsible for their bad behavior, the author points out, is to encourage more of it.  Period.<br />This books delivers more than it promises.  For those who want to be enlightened, buy it today.	2003-06-25

In &quot;The Quest for Cosmic Justice,&quot; Thomas Sowell expounds on his analysis in &quot;The Vision of the Anointed&quot; of the left-leaning ideological vision behind many legal and policy decisions made over the years.  Sowell distinguishes &quot;traditional justice&quot; - based on established rules, laws and procedures - from &quot;cosmic justice,&quot; which seeks to impose left-leaning &quot;solutions&quot; on society.  The cosmic view of justice, as Sowell points out, is devoid of logic, abhorrent of emperical evidence and facts, and yet despite this those who espouse this view try to impose it on the rest of society, no matter what (or how dire) the consequences.<br />Dr. Sowell's erudition, attention to bare-bones analysis, common sense, and the truth make him one of America's most respected scholars.  I feel that I am a more enlightened and intelligent citizen because of this and other Sowell publications.	2003-06-06

In \\"The Vision of the Anointed,\\" Thomas Sowell does a masterful job in exposing all of the rhetorical garbage with which we are bombarded at the hands of the liberal elite intelligensia. This books outlines and analyzes the many legal social policy decisions rendered over the years based upon this group's own ever-growing sense of their own moral superiority - i.e. \\"anointed vision\\" - and how such rulings and policies have had often counterproductive (and sometimes disastrous) outcomes.   <br />Some common themes that emanate from reading this book regarding those who espouse this anointed vision are:<br />1.  They are absolutely convinced of the righteousness of their views and policies despite in some cases mountains of empirical evidence to the contrary;<br />2.  Instead of attempting to understand opposing views (much less debate them), those with the anointed vision use verbal sleight-of-hand to evade such views - and even try to denigrate and publicly discredit those who espouse them;<br />3.  They have a tendency of hiding behind their \\"good intentions\\" when the policies put in place based on their vision blow up in their faces, asserting that things would have been \\"even worse\\" were it not for their \\"vision\\";<br />4.  They view certain aspects of reality that do not conform to their \\"vision\\" as \\"problems\\" or even \\"crises\\" in need of \\"solutions,\\" as opposed to systemic processes involving normal human interactions and economic trade-offs;<br />5.  They interpret everything from the U.S. Constitution and legal statues to statistics on such things as \\"income distribution,\\" crime, and the \\"legacy of slavery\\" in explaining the rise of black single-parent homes since the 1960s, in ways that fit ever-so-neatly with their vision, history, the real world and all opposing views be damned.<br />To quote one of the most poignant passages in the book, Sowell discusses the issue of crime as follows:<br />\\"Those with the vision of the anointed are especially reluctant to see human nature as a source of the evils they wish to eradicate.  Instead, they seek special causes of particular evils.  Nothing so exemplifies this approach as the perennial attempts to get at the... 'root causes'... of crime.  There seems to be no awareness that people commit crimes because they are human beings.  That is, people's natural impulses are to favor themselves over others and to disregard the harm they create in trying to satisfy their own desires in the easiest way.  If most people do not behave this way..., it is because they have been through a long process of becoming civilized - and because this process is buttressed by law enforcement.  Civilization has been aptly called, 'a thin crust over a volcano.'  The anointed are constantly picking at that crust.\\" (pg. 250)<br />For those who really want to be enlightened and informed citizens, buy this book, read it carefully, and take notes.	2003-06-02

I have recently been interested in reading more of Thomas Sowell's books, having just finished his eye-opening &quot;Inside American Education (1993)&quot; before reading this one.  Having read his autobiography, I now have a better appreciation for this man - his love of scholar, intellectual excellence, and most importantly, the truth.<br />Although this entire book is a must-read, I would like to touch on a couple of areas therein that really got my attention.  One was Sowell's view on race-based affirmative action.  From the very beginning Sowell saw the inherent flaws in this policy, particularly in college admissions.  Granting academically underqualified and underprepared minority students to elite and academically intensive universities all in the name of &quot;equality&quot; was, as Sowell saw early on, basically a case of putting students in academic settings there they were sure to fail.  It was a recipe for disaster from the outset.  In particularly, he saw many college and university administrators bypassing the most qualified minority students in favor of the most ideologically and politically &quot;pro-black&quot; younsters who were just not prepared for the rigors of, say, a Cornell University, where Sowell taught for a time.  He adamantly spoke out against this time and again, but to no avail.<br />Which brings me to another aspect of Sowell's life and personality that appealed to me: He was not afraid to question or challenge authority.  True, he made many an enemy as a result, but this didn't shake him.  In fact, as he points out, the thing that hurts people the most is the truth.  He was not afraid to tell the truth, whether anyone like it or not.<br />Thomas Sowell is one of the greatest intellectual minds of our time.  I highly recommend this book.	2003-05-24

Simpson verdict was announced in October 1995, and I bought Chris Darden's book as soon as it was published. I was (and still am) inspired by Darden's story of how he grew up, why he decided to become a lawyer, and all of his personal and professional trials, tribulations, and triumphs - not to mention the guts that it took to agree to be on the prosecution team of &quot;the trial of the century.&quot;  <br />Reading about all of the ostracism that Darden suffered by blacks in L.A. (not to mention being all but skewered in the court of national black public opinion) enraged me.  The fact that he was labeled a &quot;sellout,&quot; &quot;Uncle Tom,&quot; and a &quot;race traitor&quot; of the worst kind for prosecuting (as was his job) a wealthy black celebrity athelete - whom most people, including blacks, knew was guilty as hell! - made me realize as a young black man that sometimes we as blacks indeed are our own worst enemy.  As Darden poignantly points out, supporting a black man who, based on the evidence, murdered his white wife and her friend is not &quot;getting back at the [white] man.&quot;  To add insult to injury, after the verdict and subsequent black celebrations, some black lawyers group decided to &quot;honor&quot; Darden at a dinner - with Johnnie Cochran as the guest speaker, no less - with what I'll term a BLACK GUILT-ASSUAGING AWARD.  This was basically their way of saying to Darden, after taking him to the public opinion woodshed for over a year, that &quot;You're still 'down' with us.  You're welcome back into the community.&quot;  In accepting  his award, Darden, to his credit, let them know: &quot;You don't have to welcome me back into the community, because I never left.&quot;<br />Christopher Darden has nothing to be ashamed about.  He honored the legal profession by doing his civic duty to the best of his ability as an officer of the court AND the law.  We could all learn a lot from his example.	2003-04-26

Words cannot describe what it felt like to actually stand inside of the jail cell that Mandela occuppied.

I must admit that until the 2000 elections, I was a die-hard Democrat, as most other African-Americans will claim. However, my views have changed over the last few years. One of the issues I had (and still do) with current black \\"leadership,\\" was its emphasis on black suffering and white guilt - 40 years after the Civil Rights Movement. In particular, it bothered me that Jesse Jackson would go out of his way to squeeze as much guilt as possible out of white America, all in the name of the poor. After reading \\"Shakedown,\\" it has become painfully clear to me that he cares about as much for the poor as Usama bin Laden does about world peace.<br />From the opening chapter, Kenneth Timmerman details Jackson's web of lies, half-truths and deception as he has successfully shaken down the federal government and corporate America for millions of dollars to enrich himself and his already-wealthy black business and political cronies. Numerous examples of \\"the content of Jackson's character\\" include his bold-faced lie that Martin Luther King \\"died in my arms\\" after being shot in April 1968; his cozy relationship with Jeff Fort and Chicago's notorious Black P Stone Nation/El Rukn street gang; his chummy-chummy rapport with murderous African dictator thugs like General Sani Abacha (Nigeria), Charles Taylor (Liberia) and Foday Sankoh (Sierra Leone); how smaller community-based organizations that have asked for Jackson's assistance have been given the cold shoulder because they couldn't \\"afford\\" him; and, how Jackson has dealt with black businesses that refuse to play by his rules (i.e. line his pockets).<br />One of the most egregious examples of Jackson's appetite for fanning the flames of racial division to suit his own ends was during the 2000 presidential election - specifically, the Flordia vote count debacle. As Jackson alleged voter intimidation by Republicans, the author shows the \\"good Reverend's\\" complete disregard for the facts.  For one thing, the reported \\"roadblocks\\" involved incidents that had absolutely nothing to do with the elections.  Secondly, an analysis of the spoiled ballots from all the Florida precincts revealed that the group most prone to having their ballots spoiled were African-American REPUBLICANS! According to Yale Scholar John R. Lott, Jr., who did the analysis, black Republicans were over 50 times more likely to have their votes tossed out than black Floridians in general, and that Republican voters overall were 14% more likely to have their votes tossed out in precincts where the county election supervisor was a Democrat, and 31% more likely when the supervisor was a BLACK Democrat.  These results were published in an LA Times article dated November 12, 2001, and I haven't heard a peep about it from either the NAACP, the Congressional Black Caucus, Al Sharpton, or Rainbow/PUSH.  Then again, by this time Jackson probably had other things on his mind (e.g. still reeling from getting busted for having fathered an out-of-wedlock child with a former assistant).<br />This book proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that Jesse Jackson is nothing more than a \\"shakedown artist\\" and \\"povery pimp.\\" He wants black and white Americans divided, for such division has made him a very wealthy man. He knows that in this day and age the average white person would rather be called a child molester than a racist, and has milked that fear for all its worth. Bravo to Timmerman for this painstakingly researched and eloquently written book that exposes Jesse Jackson for the charlatan that he is. If the Rev. Jesse Jackson represents today's black \\"leadership,\\" then we're all in big trouble.involved incidents that had absolutely nothing to do with the elections.

He is not afraid to turn the microscope on black America and force us to take a hard look our current ways of thinking and how they hinder us from fully realizing our potential as the powerful people that we are. In fact, the author does so with surgical precison in this book, which is why black \\"flaming leftist\\" critics like Ishmael Reed have basically resorted to such childish tactics as calling the man names (e.g. \\"a rent-a-black who only writes and says what conservative whites want to hear.\\"  Give me a break!) instead of trying to offer thoughtful rebuttals to his arguments. They can't refute him, quite frankly, because deep down people like Reed know that McWhorter is telling the truth. Period. <br />One of the most important themes of this book is that the author wants black Americans to stop emphasizing black plight and misery and all the negative aspects of our history, while treating our successes as anecdotal \\"exceptions\\" (a constant theme in more liberal black American discourse these days).  In other words, let's ACCENT THE POSITIVES: i.e., focus more on black American achievements of yesterday and today (two notable examples being that the current U.S. secretary of state and national security adviser are both black).  As he states poignantly, a people cannot continue to stress how strong it is if it constantly focuses on the negative aspects of its history and current state of affairs.  McWhorter blasts such an oxymoronic way of thinking, while reiterating a point he made in \\"LOSING THE RACE\\" that black American success stories nowadays are not longer \\"the exception\\" - they are THE NORM.<br />John McWhorter represents the most refreshing and eye-opening contribution to the dialogue on American race relations since Shelby Steele and Thomas Sowell. This book along with \\"Losing the Race\\" should be required reading in every African-American studies and sociology college curriculum in the country.	2003-02-19

This book is arguably the most balanced treatment of one of the most poorly understood issues in contemporary American public policy.  I read it when it first came out in 1996, and I feel that I a much better informed citizen on affirmative action as a result.  This books is a collection of essays that present all sides of the debate on affirmative action from well-known scholars, businessmen, political and civic leaders.  It dispels many of the misconceptions of the policy while highlighting its inherent flaws, explains the goals of the policy in its intended form, and includes two all but forgotten perspectives - that of women and Asian-Americans.<br />A very good and easy read, anyone with a desire to have as broad an understanding as possible on affirmative should buy and read this book.	2003-01-17

I first read &quot;The Color Complex&quot; as a college student in 1996.  As a dark-skinned Black male, this book brought to light the lion's share of all of the ostracism, ridicule, and occasional bullying that I experienced as a child.  It also made me realize that a large segment of the Black community still does not want to acknowledge (let alone deal with) the fact that Black intra-racial color discrimination is still alive and well.  Never under-estimate the power of denial.<br />It is very hypocritical that many Black &quot;leaders (?)&quot; prefer to always point the finger at White America for all of its sins, yet refuse to challenge us as Black folks to take a good, hard look at ourselves and how we treat each other.   Bravo to the authors for &quot;airing our dirty laundry&quot; in a way that forces much needed and long overdue Black American community introspection.  <br />This book will make some uncomfortable, but that's the point!  Just like &quot;Losing the Race&quot; by John McWhorter, this books represents a much-needed wake-up call for Black Americans.	2003-01-02

Author Robert Gordon lays out in brilliant and well-researched detail the life and times of Muddy Waters, from his early days on the Stovall, MS plantation and his first &quot;recording session&quot; for Alan Lomax and the Library of Congress, to his rise as the progenator of Chicago blues, to his final days and passing in 1983 and how his life shaped those of virtually everyone close to him.  Gordon, in rare interviews with Waters' family members, friends and close associates, also lets the reader into the life of a blues man of Waters' stature at that time: constant touring, heavy drinking and smoking, womanizing, the out-of-wedlock children that he fathered, and how it all affected him personally, professionally and financially.  In short, this book honestly tells the story of Muddy Waters the Chicago Blues icon, the player, the man, the human being.<br />This is a must-read for any blues fan.	2002-08-25

Those of us into blues harmonica know that Little Walter is the father of this musical genre. Although he was not necessarily the first to put harp to mic to amplifier (I believe Snooky Pryor was many years before), Little Water undoubtedly revolutionized how amplified blues harp was played, then and now. He turned the harmonica - a simple pocket instrument that many musicians didn't take seriously - into a musical force that Muddy Waters pianist Otis Spann called \\"the mother of the band.\\" As a budding harp player, I do not consider any band a true BLUES BAND if it doesn't have a harmonica player at the forefront (as opposed to the background). We who follow blues music have Marion \\"Little Walter\\" Jacobs to thank for that.<br />This book is a must-have for any and all blues harmonica enthusiasts. As with Robert Gordon's recent Muddy Waters bio \\"Can't Be Satisfied,\\" the authors of \\"Blues With A Feeling\\" lay out in brilliant detail, from painstaking research and interviews with family, friends and associates, Walter's life in ways many had never been privy to. Just as his musical ability made him famous, his quick temper, heavy drinking and overall reckless lifestyle, unfortunately, led to his eventual, yet far too early demise.<br />If you really want to understand the man, myth, icon, and human being that was, is and will always be Little Walter, then buy this book.	2002-08-25

This is unquestionably the best piece of factual non-fiction scholarship I have ever read. John McWhorter hits the nail right on the head in eloquently explaining the three &quot;cults&quot; that plague us as Black Americans - Victomology, Separatism, and particularly ANTI-INTELLECTUALISM. As a young Black man whose dearly departed mother instilled in him the value of education at an early age, who did well in school, and who was viciously ostracized and ridiculed by his Black peers for &quot;actin' white&quot; as a result, reading LOSING THE RACE represents the ultimate validation for me. The fact that so many Black young people see not only academic success, but a mere love of learning as something &quot;not BLACK&quot; is a CULTURAL problem I have witnessed my entire life. I realized in reading McWhorter's book that I am not alone. <br />The many anecdotes he gives poignantly and accurately explains the Black American self-induced psychological phobia of anything scholarly: how Black freshmen accepted at Berkeley after affirmative action was repealed (i.e. because of their high academic prowess and not their skin color) were looked upon as &quot;OREOS&quot; by the Black preference-benefitting upper-classmen; how when he was growing up one of his childhood friends had his little sister slap him for correctly spelling the word &quot;CONCRETE&quot;; how, while in graduate school, after engaging the professor in a discussion on the Swahili verb TO BE - a subject of dear interest to him - some other Black grad students approached him afterwards asking &quot;whether or not he was a TRUE BROTHA.&quot; While reading, I had flashbacks of my own childhood experiences of being dissed almost daily by my own &quot;people&quot; for being smart and having the audacity to actually ENJOY school.  <br />For years I have grown sick and tired of liberal &quot;blacker than thou&quot; pseudo-intellectuals who claim to have MY best interests at heart as a Black American.  They blame all of our problems on racism, constantly making us out to be victims - even 30-plus years after the Civil Rights Movement!  Yet, they are never willing to turn the microscope on us as Black Americans and how we should take responsibility for the ways in which we do ourselves in, but are quick to try to censor, berate, and/or brand as a &quot;traitor&quot; someone like McWhorter for doing so, all for the so-called crime of &quot;airing our dirty laundry.&quot;  If I, the youngest of six children and the product of a broken home in inner-city Cleveland, OH, can graduate high school VALEDICTORIAN, become the first college graduate in my family, earn a master's degree, and ultimately become a diplomat for the U.S. government, then what in God's name is wrong with (suburban) middle-class black students - as the author clearly points out in his discussion of Shaker Heights High School - who attend the best schools, with top-notch teachers, guidance counselors and other educational resources, have college-educated parents and therefore no excuse NOT to succeed, yet STILL choose not to apply themselves, blow off the importance of education, care more about being popular than being smart, and then later on want to turn around and blame &quot;WHITEY&quot; for all of the opportunities that they missed?  The three &quot;Cults&quot;as accurately explained by the author are what's wrong.<br />Furthermore, for those Blacks who fear that this book will serve as &quot;further ammunition for racist Whites to use against us,&quot; I say that such an arguement is a copout.  We need to stop worrying about what white people think of us and start getting our collective house(s) in order.<br />This book NEEDED to be written, and I applaud Professor McWhorter for having the guts to write it as passionately and critically as he has.  It serves as a much-needed wake-up call for the entire Black community.	2001-11-17
