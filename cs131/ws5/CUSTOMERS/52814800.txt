Unfortunately for Eric, old habits die hard and he not only continues struggling with his women habit, but he picks up an even worse habit that's even harder for him to break.<br /><br />Mistakes Men Make is a novel that is literally over before you know it.  The author's writing, and especially his storyline, grab your attention and you find yourself reading just one more page to see what's going to happen next.  The only minor criticism is that one of the major plot twists just seemed to come out of nowhere and there wasn't enough of a build-up to make it convincing.<br /><br />If you have a few hours and you would like to read a book that is sure to entertain, pick up a copy of Bryon Harmon's latest offering because you won't be disappointed.	2005-07-11

Travis Hunter's second novel, Married But Still Looking, brings back some of the characters that were in The Hearts Of Men (his first novel) while centering in on the lives of Genesis Styles and his family which includes his mother Virginia, his sisters Phyllis and Grace, and his brother Grover.  Travis Hunter's biggest writing strength is his ability to tell such a realistic story that both men and women should enjoy while getting his message across (families need to stick together, for instance).  The main character in the story, Genesis, is a man who is engaged to be married yet he cannot control his sexual appetite long enough to stay faithful for more than a week or two.  He thinks that he is really great at hiding his sexual escapades but his fianc&eacute;e, Terri, is no dummy!  I was able to just sit back, enjoy the ride, and wait for Genesis to make a major screw up and I had a great time getting to that point.  Then there is his mean-spirited older sister Phyllis who is unhappily married to a white man whom she only married since she hates black men so much.  But, along comes a GOOD BLACK MAN and her view of black men comes crashing down to the ground.  To round out the cast of Genesis and his family, his brother, Grover, has an addiction to cocaine which he struggles to overcome, his younger sister Grace is about to become a minister, and their mother, Virginia, has a medical problem that brings her children together like never before.<br />If you are looking for a story that is not overloaded with drama, drama, and MORE DRAMA, you ought to give this one a try as you will probably see a lot of family members and friends in the various roles of these wonderful characters.  If you are like me and you enjoy a story where problems are dealt with and worked out in a logical manner and if you love to root for a family to work things out and stick together through thick and thin then you are definitely in for an enjoyable reading experience.<br /><br />This novel was excellent from the beginning until the end and Travis Hunter's fans and even those who have not read his first book should be pleased and won over with this one!llent from the beginning until the end and Travis Hunter's fans and even those who have not read his first book should be pleased and won over with this one!	2002-07-02

This is a story about a sister, Alice, her brother, Boone, their mother, Meg, and their EVIL stepfather, Simon.  This is an excellent \\"coming of age\\" story with strong characters that you won't soon forget.  I loved the way that Kathy Hepinstall tackled a tough subject, abuse, delicately and sometimes even with wit and humor.  Get a copy of The Absence Of Nectar and be prepared to stay up a few hours!	2002-03-28

Erasure was an awesome book on so many levels that I don't even know if I can stress how much I enjoyed it! Thelonius \\"Monk\\" Ellison is a struggling author who has bills to pay and no money coming in to pay them. He happens to one day hear about this \\"runaway\\" success book called \\"We's Lives In Da Ghetto\\" and he finds out that the author has sold over 300,000 copies of it and it's being made into a movie. Totally fed up with being told that he's not \\"black\\" enough with his writing (meaning, he needs to write a \\"ghetto book\\"), he decides to write a book called \\"My Pafology\\" (later renamed to the \\"F\\" word) under a penname of Stagg R. Leigh.... Throughout this entire ordeal, he has to pretend to be someone who doesn't exist as he's dealing with his personal disgust with feeling like a \\"sellout\\" also while he has to deal with his dissolving family. To say that I laughed reading \\"My Pafology\\" (it's a story within the story) would be a major understatement. In \\"My Pafology\\", he hit dead-on with so many stereotypes that you couldn't help but to laugh, even if you didn't really want to! I have personally complained for a LONG TIME now about the books that are currently on the market. I've also wondered if someone thinks that we, as African Americans, aren't capable of reading anything else other than the SAME stories OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN! To say Erasure was NEEDED is an understatement! This was a great wake up call for the \\"work\\" that's currently saturating the African American reading market. I usually don't say books are \\"important\\" but this one is. Buy this book NOW and enjoy!	2002-03-07

I wasn't even sure what I expected but this wasn't it!  In any case, this book captivated me from the beginning until the end and I found myself flipping back pages, from time to time, just to make sure I was keeping all of these characters/generations straight!  Lolita Files has written a bold and daring book that covers all sorts of family secrets.  Ms. Files has earned my praises not just for writing an amazing story, but for hopefully setting a new trend.  I personally would like to see other writers like herself get away from the usual and typical writing about 2-4 friends who have drama, drama, DRAMA in their lives.  The market is saturated with too much of this type of book and I found Child Of God refreshing to read as well as original.  I hadn't read a book by Lolita Files since Scenes From A Sistah but Child Of God is definitely great stuff.  Get this one and enjoy!	2002-01-31

It's a rarity anymore when I can say \\"That novel left me speechless\\" but that's EXACTLY how I felt by the end of this book!  With each page, I felt more and more (mostly sadness) for her problems in life and as well as for her illiteracy.  I was very happy to see someone (her teacher) FINALLY stand up to her and make her learn how to read and write.  This book goes from sad to sadder to saddest by the end, but seeing that Precious learned how to read and write somehow made this book that much more bearable.  To say I couldn't put this book down would have been a major understatement!  I was shocked and amazed with practically each page I turned from page 1 to the end.  Deep and disturbing but definitely a must-read if I've ever read one!	2002-01-23

Shattered Souls is a really fun book with 4 really great characters:  Britton, Indera, Damascus, and Chyna.  I thought that Indera and Damascus had the most fun in the book and they were the characters who I found, at times, to cause me to burst out laughing from their comments and situations.  This was an excellent story that starts off kind of on the superficial side but, by the end of the book, you get to much better understand why each character behaves the way he or she does.[...]Excellent story by newcomer Dywane Birch.  I was told, by the author himself, that there IS a sequel in the works so fans of this book, like myself, should look forward to the return of these wonderful characters.	2002-01-23

I've read interracial books before and I was thinking this would be a rehash.  In any case, I figured that I'd give it a try anyway and I'm extremely glad I did since I was hooked from the first page!  I loved the story and I love the writing.  Mingus had a lot of issues to deal with, but so did her mother, her father, and her sister.  To have parts of the story told by the different characters was refreshing since it allowed the reader to better understand each one of them.  One didn't have to have grown up in an interracial family to understand some of the pain that Mingus went through trying to &quot;fit in&quot;.  This is an excellent book by first time novelist Jenoyne Adams which is also one of my favorites of 2001.	2001-12-28

I kept seeing this book every time I went into a bookstore and the cover always caught my eye, but I would repeatedly walk away from it since I usually don't read any non-fiction books.  Well, after hearing from some of my trusted book-reading friends about how great this book was, I decided to finally go ahead and give it a try.  Well, the first thing that I noticed is how the book read like fiction.  After reading about 20 pages, I was pretty much hooked!  This book was so good that I would forget at times that this was a TRUE STORY!  I found myself so upset and disturbed by the way he was treated at the Picketts' house that I didn't know if I could last through that section without wanting to put the book down.  But, I persevered and I made it to the very happy and satisfying conclusion.  For Antwone Fisher to literally survive against the odds by making something of his life was amazing, inspiring, and absolutely unforgettable.  I would love to meet him one day and I definitely look forward to the day that his story hits the big screen!!!	2001-12-26

The Harris Family is a satisfying conclusion to the excellent story that began in The Harris Men.  Five years have passed since the first book ended and all of the family members are back with a new set of issues to deal with.  I think RM Johnson's story telling is absolutely amazing and this is sure to be a hit with all of the people who loved The Harris Men.  I found that I could not put this book down once I started it because I just enjoyed this book so much.  I also appreciated how RM Johnson was clever enough to give you flashbacks from the first story because that helped me to remember some of the details that I had forgotten about.  A lot of the scenes were really touching, especially some of the scenes involving Marcus.  Buy this book and enjoy!	2001-12-13

No, it's not because of the subject matter either.  I am supposed to hate this book because I think fighting over a lady and compromising to stay with that lady is crazy.  But, with that said, Between Lovers grabbed me from the first page and never let me go.  I LOVED this book and I found myself laughing at the characters one minute and mad at one of them the next.  What amazed me about this book is how honest and realistic it comes across when, at first glance, this is one of those far fetched ideas (a man and a lady wanting the same lady).  Some people I've talked to are uncomfortable with the lesbian stuff but these same people have read E. Lynn Harris' books???  Anyway, give this book a try and maybe you'll enjoy it as much as I did!	2001-12-13

It grabs you from the very beginning and it takes you on a ride that you'll NEVER forget.  If this book doesn't get you to think about turning your life over to Christ, I don't think ANY BOOK, other than the Bible, will!  I loved how, even after people realized that practically entire churches had people who were &quot;missing&quot;, they STILL refused to believe that what the Bible fortold in Revelations came to fruition!  I thought this book was very exciting and I loved the two main characters, Buck Williams and Rayford Steele.  A highly recommended novel for Christians and non-Christians who are looking for a good reason to become a Christian!	2001-09-02

All of the characters that I learned to love the first time around were all back in this book and the author even had some new characters for you to fall in love with.  The book starts off where My Soul To Keep ended and that's with the birth of Bee-Bee (Fana).  Tananarive Due is just an amazingly gifted writer who can easily draw you into the world that she's created.  One of the many things I love so much about her writing is that, not only does she write books that make the pages turn quickly, but she makes you think about her books long after you've put them down.  I STILL think about The Living Blood and My Soul To Keep and I still find myself wondering &quot;what if&quot; this kind of thing happened to me.  I still find myself wondering, &quot;What would I have done in Lucas' situation&quot;?  If you are looking for a book with some very deep subject matter and some substance, you have to first read My Soul To Keep and then follow it up with The Living Blood.	2001-09-02

It wasnt because his writing was horrible or even because the story was dull, but it was because I was getting tired of all the overly described gas/burping problems that took place with the characters that were found in the woods.  I understood after the first dozen times the problems that a couple of the characters were having in the gas and burping department but Stephen King described this stuff to death!  I usually like reading books during my lunch break, but I learned to just put the book down when I wanted to eat. Nevertheless, I stuck with it and I really found myself immersed in this books storyline, especially the one involving Jonesy and Mr. Gray.  I know that Henry and Duddits were key players in the book, but, Jonesy and Mr. Gray stole the show, as far as I was concerned.  I loved the mind games that Jonesy and Mr. Gray were playing with each other throughout the book and these &quot;two&quot; made the book very fun-to-read.  This was my first time reading one of Stephen Kings books and now that I have an idea what to expect, I am looking forward to trying some of his other books.	2001-07-31

A Long Way From Home is one of those books where I found myself unable to put it down, yet, it made me angrier and angrier as I turned each page!  This is a story about slavery and it follows a family of slaves from Montpelier where James Madison, the ex-President, lived.  The story takes you from Susie, Clara's mother, all the way to Clara's children, Ellen and Susan, to Clara's grandchildren.  This is an absolutely powerful tale of hope for the blacks to receive their freedom.  What I didn't think about or really realize, at least until I read this book, is that a lot of blacks during slavery times really did NOT want to be free.  I always assumed that blacks wanted their freedom at all costs but when faced with poverty and starvation versus slavery, many of the slaves actually preferred slavery.  In any case, A Long Way From home is one of those books that I'm glad I read although I really couldn't wait to get to the ending, not because this was a horrible book, but because I really wanted to know how things ended up and because I really, REALLY wanted to know if Susan obtained her freedom before the book ended!  Yes, this book can make you angry from time to time, but, don't let that stop you from reading a fantastic story!	2001-07-31

I really liked all 3 of the main male characters in this book and I found myself feeling the happiness and sadness that these characters felt at different stages of their lives.  I don't want to give any of the story away but I was really touched with something that happened in Bernard's life as well as Poppa Doc's at the end of the book.  This book might not be enough to straighten out a trouble man's life, but it should definitely give one something to think about!	2001-07-31

This is a book whose subject matter centers around sex, and although it could get &quot;steamy&quot; at times, I never found it disgusting or raunchy.  Nelson George pulls off writing an engaging book that caught me from the &quot;Godiva Chocolates scene&quot; up until the very last page.  The main character, Dean Chance, was a man who THOUGHT his woman satisfied him, especially in the bedroom, but after he meets a temptress named Bee Cole, his world was literally turned upside down.  Bee was the kind of lady who saw what she wanted (in this case, Dean) and she got exactly whom she wanted!  Readers looking for a hard-to-put-down book that has some sex thrown in for good measure should definitely check this book out and soon!	2001-07-16

Thunderland was a book that I had heard of a few times and it was even mentioned in another book I read as a &quot;book-to-read&quot; so I decided to go to Brandon Massey's website and read a few pages of his book, online, before I finally decided to go ahead and order it.  Well, I got the book and, once I started reading it, I found that I could NOT put this book down.  I loved how the &quot;hero&quot;, Jason, was a teenager and I also loved how the &quot;supporting cast&quot; were his two friends, Shorty and Brains, who were also his age.  This was a very well told novel of suspense that readers of the suspense/horror genre are sure to enjoy.  It's not a long book so it shouldn't take more than a few hours to go in the world of Thunderland but I'm sure, once you're there, you'll be in for a journey you won't soon forget!	2001-07-01

I usually try not to compare one writer to another one in my reviews but I'll break that rule in this review.  To me, this is the book that Eric Jerome Dickey wished he'd written when he wrote Liar's Game!  Good Peoples was good, fun reading from the first page until the last.  I never felt that the story went too &quot;over-the-top&quot; nor did I ever feel that there was just drama thrown in for drama's sake.  Myles Moore and Marisa Marrero felt like two very real and very believable people and I loved how the roles were reversed with Myles being the &quot;I want to get married and have children&quot; person and Marisa was the &quot;I can't say I love you&quot; person.  This book felt real to me from the beginning and I loved Marcus Major's writing style and his sense of humor.  I haven't laughed this much reading a book since I read Cheaters (by Eric Jerome Dickey) over a year ago and I actually thought that this book was funnier which, for me, is saying a lot!  Marcus Major has moved into my &quot;will buy anything he writes&quot; list and I am definitely looking forward to reading his latest book, 4 Guys and Trouble.	2001-05-09

This is one of those books where I could kick back, read, laugh, and enjoy.  I really loved Benny's character and I loved how he respected his parents, although he might not have agreed with them in every instance.  This is one of those good books that made me think about stuff (like my childhood, for instance) that I usually do not think about on a day-to-day basis and it also made me thankful that I grew up with good and loving parents.  The other thing I really liked about this book is the fact that there weren't hardly any curse words in it so this is a book that I could enjoy and then I can give it to my mother to enjoy.  Readers searching for a nice family oriented story should definitely give this one a try.	2001-05-07

I liked Liar's Game and I didn't have a hard time getting into the story, but the title made me think that there was going to be more to the story pertaining to lying to your lover.  The other thing that I noticed was sorely missing was Eric Jerome Dickey's brilliant sense of humor.  When I read Cheaters, I was literally laughing until it hurt.  When I read Liar's Game, I smiled a few times, chuckled maybe once or twice, but this book did not strike me as being all that funny.  If Eric was trying to write a more serious book, he accomplished that but if he was thinking that this book was as funny or funnier than Cheaters, he's sadly mistaken.  With all of that said, I did enjoy this book and I still would recommend it to be read, but I would recommend reading his other books, especially Cheaters, first. Nevertheless, like a lot of the other reviewers, I'm a lifetime fan of Eric and I just hope that his next book is back up to the standard that Cheaters set.	2001-05-07

Although I personally enjoyed Blues Dancing more, Tumbling was, nevertheless, a very memorable story.  The story begins with Herbie coming home one day after a night out drinking to find that his front steps had a baby waiting there for him to find.  From that moment, my attention was grabbed.  The reason why I would give this book 4 instead of 5 stars is because I found the story seemed to drag along from time to time.  Other than the occasional feelings of &quot;Get to the point&quot;, I found myself having a good time reading this book.  I will definitely reading Tempest Rising some time this year as well as any other books she writes.	2001-04-24

When I put this book down, I would find myself thinking about it and being anxious to pick it back up so that I could find out more about this man, John The Baptist Wright, whom most knew as Hot Johnny.  Each chapter is devoted to one of the women in his life and they range from his wife, to his mother, to his half sister.  While reading each chapter, a little more about Johnny and his life will unfold before your eyes and, by the final chapter, you'll know and understand how Johnny got his name and what he really is like.  This is not a book I'd recommend for anyone but the serious reader as casual readers might not understand it or they might just give up.  But, if you want to read an excellent story, pick up this book, stick with it, and be ready to enter the fantastic world of Hot Johnny!	2001-03-31

So, I decided to put it on my list.  Well, after reading this book, I am still wondering what took me so long to read it!  This book was well-written, exciting, and very suspenseful.  I really enjoyed The Sandman, Jack Casey, Miles Hamilton, and especially Malcolm Fletcher.  This was a classic case of good vs. evil and, while I was rooting for Jack Casey, I found myself really enjoying and respecting the cleverness of The Sandman.  I really enjoyed how the Sandman continued to call and torment Jack Casey throughout the book.  He knew ALL of the buttons to push to get to Jack and, believe me, HE PUSHED ALL OF THEM!  Although Jack is the main character of the book, you cannot help but to take notice to the antics of Malcolm Fletcher, an ex-FBI agent.  He was the &quot;guardian angel&quot; that always seemed to pop up whenever Jack was in trouble.  Fans of the Thomas Harris books or even the James Patterson books really ought to give this one a try.  If you are looking for heart-pounding suspense, this book should not be missed!	2001-03-13

I really enjoy reading the Alex Cross series of books by Patterson but this book just did not excite me like the others I've read (Along Came A Spider, Kiss The Girls, and Cat &amp; Mouse).  I personally wish that he'd quit writing the &quot;two-killers-in-one-book&quot; stuff.  Switching back and forth between the child killer and Jack &amp; Jill was really getting on my nerves and this book just didn't give me the suspense or the adrenaline rush that I've gotten from his other books.  I think Patterson, when he's at the top of his game, can write very exciting and suspenseful stuff.  I haven't read Pop Goes The Weasel or Roses Are Red yet but I'm hoping they're both better than this one.	2001-02-15

I absolutely loved the main character, Patricia Conley, and I loved her attitude throughout the book.  I found myself rooting for her one moment, thinking what she was thinking the next, and then laughing out loud at some of her actions and thoughts.  Evelyn Coleman's writing was fantastic and I loved how she figured out a way to incorporate science and history without slowing down the story.  Fans of Valerie Wilson Welsey's Tamara Hayle series of mysteries definitely ought to give this one a try.  It was my first visit to the world of Patricia Conley, but, if Evelyn Coleman decides to write more books with this character, I'll definitely give them a try.	2001-02-05

Other times, I want to just read something light, entertaining, and funny.  Something's Wrong With Your Scale is one of those books, similar to Beeperless Remote, where you don't have to struggle to try to get the author's point.  With Something's Wrong With Your Scale, you just sit back, turn the pages, and laugh until it hurts!  I really had a good time reading this book but I personally didn't like Kayla's character too much.  I felt like she should have been more supportive of Sonny's desire to lose weight, even if it wasn't really her desire to do so.  Instead, she just seemed to try to hold him back throughout the story.  I guess the &quot;misery loves company&quot; saying was holding true throughout this story.  Nevertheless, I really had fun reading this book and if you want something that's not overly challenging but full of fun, give this one a try.	2001-01-27

I loved the subplots in the story, especially Howard and Vivian's rocky relationship.  I found myself laughing out loud in some parts of the story and very sad in others.  I definitely can say that I've never read anything quite like this book but it was worth reading, nevertheless.  If you can handle the subject matter of a ten year old fighting against her demons (her abusive parents), you might find yourself as absorbed with this book as I did.	2000-12-15

This story grabs you from the first page and the story is patiently and powerfully told of how Pearl and Sugar became best friends.  People tiring of African American authors writing the &quot;drama-filled, man-done-me-wrong&quot; books will find this book a very welcome and pleasant change of pace, at least I know I did.  It's a rare book that captures me from page one until the end and it's also rare when things unfold in a book that I just did NOT see coming (which this book did on more than one occasion).  Buy this book and enjoy!	2000-11-23

That made me stay away from it for a long time but a friend told me that the movie Stigmata and the book Stigmata were two different things.  So, I got the book, read it, and LOVED it!  I really enjoyed this story because it was not only different, but it was a very enjoyable, well-written book.  I loved the character Lizzie from the first page and I really enjoyed the way the book brought in the lives of Grace and Ayo/Bessie.  The only thing I didn't understand was who Martin was at the end of the book!  Besides that one little mystery (for me anyway), I thought this book was fantastic!	2000-10-21

I just seemed to find other books to read and I never got back to this one until recently.  Well, I must say that I'm very happy to have read this book.  I expected a typical story of three women with LOTS and LOTS of drama but I was pleasantly surprised to find out that the book was not full of drama and it was realistic from the beginning until the end.  It was refreshing, for me, to read a book about three black women that didn't feel like another Waiting To Exhale clone.  I found all three characters to be both realistic as well as fun to read and Venise Berry's writing style pulled me in and never let me go.	2000-10-21

The Between was an interesting story about a man, Hilton, who started feeling like he was losing his grip on reality.  He wasn't sure if he was hallucinating or if he was just flat out going crazy, but he knew someone was after his family and he was determined to protect his wife and children.  This book grabbed me from the beginning pages and I just remained captivated by this story until I finally reached the end.  This was a story that just fascinated me because Tananarive Due tells a patient story of a man whose life was turned upside down after an accident.  I know that there are readers out there who didn't really care for this story, especially after reading My Soul To Keep, but I loved this story too, just in a different way.  I think that Ms. Due is a very versatile writer and she seems to be able to pull off different styles of writing very effectively.  Those looking for the suspense and action of My Soul To Keep might be ultimately disappointed but those looking for an interesting, well-told psychologically gripping story should give The Between a try.	2000-10-04

The author was killing me with his use of language. Between using Spanish throughout the book to his switching from street language to using words over my head, I often found myself confused, frustrated, and bored.  I'm not sure if I was supposed to have found a message in this book, but, if there was one, I missed it!  Tuffy was an interesting character but I never felt like he or the book went anywhere.  It was like I was reading a few days in the life of Winston &quot;Tuffy&quot; Foshay but there really wasn't all that much in the way of a plot.  It's a rare occasion when I actually consider putting down a book without finishing it but I was tempted, SEVERAL TIMES, to put this book down and NEVER pick it up again!	2000-09-30

This was a book that my wife wanted me to read a long time ago and I put it off because I wasn't really sure I would enjoy this type of book.  Well, after finishing it, I can say that it was definitely worth reading.  If this book doesn't have you taking a second look at your life and really, REALLY thinking about the consequences of sin, then you've probably missed the point of the book.  The dragon in this book represented sin/Satan and if you were a sinner, the dragon owned you and your soul.  The only people who weren't afraid of the dragon were the men/women who believed in Jesus Christ.  The powerful and ironic thing in the book was that Harold Bly, who practically owned the entire town and who was a direct descendent of Benjamin Hyde, really thought he was the dragon's &quot;master&quot; but he learned, the HARD way, that the dragon wasn't on his side anymore than any other sinners in Hyde River.  For someone looking for a Christian fictional book with an unforgettable message, give The Oath a try.	2000-09-23

Addicted is a story that grabbed me from the beginning and just never let  go of me until the end.  If you're looking for a little erotica mixed with  an exciting story, this is definitely the book for you!  I thought a few  things in the book were a little &quot;over the top&quot; but I don't want  to give examples because it would probably ruin the book.  I thought that  some of her lovers should have just MOVED ON and not gotten so  &quot;addicted&quot; to Zoe but I'm sure there probably are some CRAZY  people out there so I can't hold that against the author too much.  I also  personally thought that Jason was just a little too quick to forgive her  for all she'd done but that's just MY opinion! :-)  Overall, though, I  found this book very fun and exciting to read and I must admit that I was  SHOCKED at the ending!	2000-08-19

Gloria Naylor definitely  challenges her readers to keep up with her and, at times, I found myself  unclear as to what I was reading.  Since I've never been into poetry much,  some of the poetry in the book had me TOTALLY lost and I also found myself  re-reading a lot of the passages that pertained to Mrs. Nedeed.  I've  become convinced that Gloria's goal is to DEPRESS her readers because there  just doesn't seem to be much happiness in ANY of her books.  Mama Day is  about as close as she'll probably ever come to a \\"happy\\" book and even it  had sadness in it.  With all of that said, I must admit that I found myself  totally drawn into this story and I found myself fascinated by the  residents of Linden Hills.	2000-08-16

Reading Walking Through Mirrors by Brian Keith Jackson was probably the  most fun I've had reading a book this year.  From the very first page, I  was not only impressed with Brian's writing style, but, Jeremy Bishop was a  character that I found very easy to get into and very easy to relate to.   When Jeremy would take trips &quot;down memory lane&quot;, I found myself  thinking about my childhood and I found myself remembering things I haven't  thought about it years.  As I turned the pages of this wonderful, lyrical  book, I just kept thinking &quot;This book could NOT have been written by a  man&quot; but it was and it's one of the best written books I've EVER read!   Once I started this book, I found myself not wanting to put it down until  I was finished.  This is a breathtaking book by the man I've personally  chosen as my favorite new author of the year!	2000-08-03

There were times when I was flat out  lost as to what Gloria Naylor was trying to tell me when she was describing  some of the things going on in some of the characters' lives.  But,  usually, by the end of the chapter, I figured out what it was that she was  trying to tell me.  If there were half-star ratings, I probably would have  given this 3 and 1/2 stars instead of 4 but, since there isn't a half star  to give, I went ahead and gave it 4 stars.  This was a book that just kind  of stayed &quot;gloomy&quot; and &quot;sad&quot; and it just never seemed  to get out of that rut.  I am not saying that every book has to be  &quot;happy&quot;, but, it would have been nice for ONE of the characters  to have had a nicer story to tell.  Nevertheless, fans of Gloria Naylor or  people wanting to be mentally challenged ought to give this book a try.	2000-08-03

They're much more exciting and much more fun to read  than his other books without that character in it.  With that said,  &quot;Cat &amp; Mouse&quot; was exciting to read and the pages just turned  at an incredibly fast pace for me.  I'm still wondering, though, how  exactly did Gary Soneji get out of jail!  At the end of &quot;Along Came A  Spider&quot;, Soneji left a message at Alex Cross' car.  Was that my  &quot;hint&quot; that he was already out of jail?  If not, I'm TOTALLY  confused as to how he got out of jail and there was NO MENTION of an  escape/release from jail throughout the book!  But, after I accepted that I  wasn't going to get an answer to my question, I still found the story  engaging and I still enjoyed the book.	2000-07-30

However, since a lot of my friends enjoyed &quot;Maintenance Man&quot;, I went to the library to get my hands on a copy of it. Well, I will admit to being PLEASANTLY surprised that this book was MUCH, MUCH better than his last one! I don't put this book in the &quot;deep&quot; or &quot;thought provoking&quot; category but, his light, fast paced book will admittedly keep you turning the pages. I actually thought the ending was pretty good too except I thought Ariel's character could have used another chapter or a better ending. If I had to make one overall complaint about the book, I think Michael needs to learn to make his characters a little more distinct or put the character's name at the beginning of the chapter so you know who you're reading about. A few times I thought I was reading one character and I was really reading about another one. With that said, Michael Baisden fans are sure to enjoy this book and even non-Michael Baisden fans (myself, for instance) will not even have much to complain about!	2000-07-15

I've read both of his books and I could not begin to sing my praises for both of his works (&quot;Walking Through Mirrors&quot; is his other book).  Brian Keith Jackson tells a story that  reminds me of Toni Morrison's &quot;The Bluest Eye&quot; in story content  but this book is far clearer to read and, quite frankly, far more enjoyable  in my opinion.  This is a story about a pregnant Anna, her 5 boys, and her  husband Joseph.  Brian tells a powerful story of how Anna struggles to keep  her family together despite her husband and his sister's intentions.  I  even liked the fact that the story's narration was told through Anna's  unborn child.  Quite simply put, this is an excellent book by a phenomenal  author.	2000-07-12

She made this book sound so fantastic that I bought it and The View From  Here at the same time.  I'm glad I bought this book on more than one level.  The story was excellent but what really blew me away was the writing style  of Brian Keith Jackson.  I cannot remember ever reading a book written as  well as this one.  His use of words made me wish that I could be a writer  and write just like he does.  Jeremy's character was so complex but so  believable that I could relate with him on so many issues.  I laughed,  several times, reading things that happened in Jeremy's past that allowed  me to think about my own past.

The politicians  in this book were portrayed so realistically that I could envision things  that happened in this book happening in our society.

However, after reading the entire book, I feel that Toni  Morrison wanted us to know all of the people around Pecola who influenced  her life.  The story actually starts at the end but then, through her  family and friends, you get filled in on what actually happened to Pecola.  I loved the way the author allows you to get inside the head of some of the  people in her life (her mother and father, for instance) because it allows  you to understand why they act the way they do.  This was an enjoyable book  that was definitely thought provoking as well.	2000-06-24

It's not too often that I feel like I'm at a loss for words but this book has left me speechless.  The beginning of the book until about more than halfway through was absolutely horrible.  I quickly grew tired of how great  the men were at finding a woman to sleep with them and I also quickly grew  tired of the women being so gullible and getting together with these  &quot;players&quot; in the book.  I personally don't believe any man's  &quot;game&quot; is as good as ANY of these guys in the book nor do I  believe that women are THAT STUPID!  For the first I don't know how many  chapters, by the end of the chapter, one of the four main characters was in  bed with someone.  But, after about the halfway point, things finally  started to change and the book finally tried to cover something else other  than sex and that's the part of the book that's left me speechless.  One of  the characters, Taj, makes a discovery and after he makes it, his friends  (CK, Joe, and Marcus) stop talk to him and the remaining chapters that  mentions this character don't really seem to &quot;wrap up&quot; anything.  The situations that happened to Marcus, CK, and Joe were sad and  depressing.  I kept looking for the &quot;happy ending&quot; that I guess  I'm accustomed to but IT WASN'T ANYWHERE TO BE FOUND IN THIS BOOK!  I went  from practically hating all of the characters in the beginning to actually  caring what happened at the end.  I would have given the book 3 stars  (based on the 2nd half of the book) but there were way too many grammatical  errors.  I don't expect perfection in every book but a lot of these errors  should have been addressed and corrected before the book was published.	2000-06-11

Each woman had her own chapter (one chapter featured two women) and it was like reading seven  short stories but characters from one story would interact with characters  from another story so it gave the book a &quot;novel&quot; feel as well.  This book captured me from the beginning until the end but I was left  confused a time or two.  I don't quite know if I understood what went on  with Mattie at the end of her chapter nor do I know if I understood what  happened to Lorraine at the end of her chapter.

He soon learns, however, that this case just seems to be too airtight and  he finds himself trying to find out what really happened.  Gary Hardwick's  strength is his ability to draw you into each character to the point where  you're turning the pages because you must know what happens.  My only  complaint about the book, though, is that it's lacking in the suspense  area.  If you're looking for an exciting book with lots of suspense too,  read Double Dead by Gary Hardwick instead of this book.	2000-06-02

My problem with the book, however, is that  some of the issues in the book never got resolved and I felt that there  wasn't much in the way of plot progression.  As far as the unresolved  issues, I will point out three of them although there were more than just  three unresolved issues.  1) He kept thinking about Kim, the girl he let  get away, but he never once tried reconciling with her.  2) He went home,  for a few days, to confront his brother to try to help straighten him out  but after he went back to college, he didn't even call his brother to find  out how he was doing.  3) His relationship with his mother was ignored and  the author never even attempted to resolve or confront their differences.  Maybe it's just me, but I felt like the book concluded but I was still left  with a lot of unanswered questions.

I knew the ending to this book after the first 2 chapters but  it just seemed to drag on and on before it got there.  My recommendation is  for anyone who hasn't read her other books, read them and skip this one.	2000-05-16

The author built up the face-to-face meeting between Betty and Drew only to have a few pages left before the book concluded.  I wanted a better  payoff than I got (or a sequel would be fine).  With that one complaint out  of the way, I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  It was very easy to get into  and it was nice to see a black man portrayed as DECENT for a change!  A lot  of the books out there pretty much put black men in the &quot;dogs&quot;  group but Drew was a GOOD MAN with REAL FEELINGS!  Go out and buy this  book.  You will not be disappointed.	2000-05-16

Reading about Tracy and her life kept me turning the pages, but the storyline was sorely lacking in anything resembling depth.  My other problem with the storyline  was that scenes just sort of repeated themselves but with just a different  boy in her life.  After about halfway through, I felt like I'd read the  same scenes over and over again, just with a different &quot;guy of the  week&quot; in her life at that time.  Maybe I would have enjoyed it more if  I were a teenager or a girl but I'm neither.  With that said, it was  interesting enough to keep me turning the pages but I personally would not  recommend this book to anyone.	2000-05-16

I feel like I've missed something since most people gave this book 4 or 5 stars but it wasn't anything special to me.  The book was a fast paced, easy-to-read book but the plot just did not grab me at all.  I bought this  book because I was told how great it was but, after I was finished reading  it, I felt like I read a different book than my friends.  My major problem  with the book, and thus the 3 star rating, was the plot was just too  predictable.  I felt like the book took way too long to get to the  conclusion I could see coming after about the first 30 to 40 pages.  I  think Camika Spencer has a lot of potential, though, so I would definitely  try another book of hers in the future.	2000-05-16

I have read all of his other books and I especially loved &quot;And This Too Shall Pass&quot; and &quot;Invisible Life&quot;.  With that said,  this is, without a doubt, his worst book to date.  This book, like his  others, was easy to read but it just felt so &quot;fake&quot;.  I didn't  feel ANY of the characters this time around.  Yes, the names were familiar  but their ACTIONS weren't!  I just felt like E. Lynn Harris should have  left these characters alone after &quot;Just As I Am&quot; if this is what  he's calling the conclusion!  I kept waiting for this story to grab me like  it has in his other books but it, unfortunately, never did.  And, the  ending was unsatisfying and left more questions than answers.  And, I know  that most people like Raymond but Basil has been my favorite character but  even he couldn't save this mediocre book.  Old fans of E. Lynn Harris will  probably read it, like I did, because it's him but I'm warning you that  this isn't his finest work but a long shot.  Anyone who hasn't read a book  by E. Lynn Harris should NOT start with this one.  Read &quot;Invisible  Life&quot; or &quot;And This Too Shall Pass&quot; instead.	2000-05-08

The only other book I have read from James Patterson besides this book was &quot;Kiss The Girls&quot;.  I got into that book from the first page but this book just never really grabbed my attention until about two-thirds  through it.  It was an easy-to-read book with a sort of interesting  storyline but I just couldn't really get into the book very much.  I'm glad  that I stuck with it until the end because I did enjoy the ending but  people looking for the fast paced action like in &quot;Kiss The Girls&quot;  need to look elsewhere.	2000-05-05

I personally had a hard time getting into this story.  I don't know if it was the setting of the book (Champion Motors which is an automobile factory) or if I just wasn't that interested in the characters,  but this book was a struggle for me to read.  In fact, I considered,  SEVERAL TIMES, putting it down although I really don't like starting a book  and not finishing it.  With that said, after I got a little further than  halfway through the book, the story did pick up and it made up for the  boring first half of the book somewhat.	2000-04-29
US	52814800	R2CHGOSFHNB2EW	0688149952	782880862	Blues Dancing: A Novel	Books	5	1	1	N	N	A Great Love Story	Verdi and Johnson, two lovers during their college years, haven't seen each other in 20 years but Johnson's back in town.  This story takes you back to their past as well as lets you know what's going on in the present.  A wonderfully told story that romantics will love and it's quite frankly a  great story even for those who aren't usually into love stories.  Once I  got to about page 200, I sat home to read the last 100+ pages just because  I had to know what happened with Verdi, Johnson, Rowe (her current  boyfriend), and Sage (her cousin's daughter).  I was fortunate to meet  Diane McKinney-Whetstone at a book signing in Philadelphia at the Black  Book Store in The Gallery (I have an autographed copy) and I am definitely  hoping that I'll meet her again to tell her how much I enjoyed this book  and to buy and have her autograph her next book!	2000-04-23

First, there were so many errors in the book (grammatical, spelling, etc...) that I almost gave up reading it.  It's bad enough not having an interesting  story (which this book did not have) but it's even worse when the writing  is horrible.  After I finally attempted to get past the numerous errors, I  found that this book just did not have much substance.  The characters  seemed superficial and one-dimensional and I just could not get into this  book.  I know that Michael Baisden has another book out (&quot;Maintenance  Man&quot;) but the bookstore would have to take EVERY book off the shelf  besides that one in order for me to try another book by this man.  Do not  waste your money on this book!	2000-04-17

The book had a nice pace to it and the story was easy to get into and to relate to.  I thought that the ending was okay but a few things  could have been tied up a little better.  With that said, anyone who knows  single parents or was raised by one will find this story worth reading.	2000-04-17

I really enjoyed Zurich's character because his thoughts and, at times, confusion were all very believable.  I have a few black gay friends  who also struggled with their sexuality so, for me, this book allowed me to  understand at least a LITTLE bit of what my friends had to go through.  This is an excellent book to read regardless of whether you are straight or  gay.	2000-04-15

I really must say that, after reading ALL of Eric Jerome Dickey's books, I really don't know how he manages to write one great book after another but he does!  With that said, I really enjoyed Jordan and Kimberly's  relationship from the beginning to the end.  This is a great book for those  who have either dealt with interracial relationships or knows someone who  has.  The plot moves along at a great pace and there were some surprises  thrown in at the end too which made for yet another excellent effort by  Eric Jerome Dickey.	2000-04-15

While I enjoyed &quot;Waiting To Exhale&quot; like a lot of other people, &quot;Disappearing Acts&quot; was  my favorite Terry McMillan book.  I do not know how she does it, but not  only does Terry know women well (she is one after all) but she knows MEN  well too.  Zora and Franklin's relationship was interesting and very  realistic.  I felt like I was there with them watching their relationship  progress through their ups and downs.  An excellent book that women and men  can enjoy and appreciate.	2000-04-14

The other characters in the book were entertaining and well developed as well.  Eric has a writing style that is  not only believable but he'll have you laughing as well.  This was the  first book by Eric Jerome Dickey that I read and after I finished it, I ran  to the store to buy &quot;Friends and Lovers&quot;.  I have since read  everything Eric's written and I'm anxiously awaiting &quot;Liar's  Game&quot;. This was the starting point for me becoming a huge Eric Jerome  Dickey fan.  Buy this book.

Eric Jerome Dickey never ceases to amaze me.  He has a natural talent to write not only believable books but he also makes you laugh in the process.  Stephan's  character and his problems with some of his women made the book literally a  laugh-out-loud riot!  I usually read during my train ride into work and  back home and I'm sure I had stares several times as I could not stop  laughing at some of the stuff Stephan went through.  Darnell was also  another character that I enjoyed thoroughly and although I'm sure one of  his &quot;major&quot; decisions won't settle too well with some people who  read the book, I was happy for him in the end.  I really could go on  and on but I'll just finish with these words...... Buy this book.  You'll  LOVE it!	2000-04-14

Shelby's character had me smiling at first and laughing shortly after.  That pretty much set the tone of the book for me and made me anxious to dive into reading this book.

I personally could not get into Mary's character.  She bothered me from the beginning until near the  end and I also did not feel that Eugene's character was developed enough  for me to understand why he was killing people.  Yes, I could tell he was  &quot;crazy&quot; but was it only from the &quot;Parson Curse&quot; that  they referred to in the book a few times?  I also did not care for the fact  that Mary was practically handed the killer at the end.  She had some  evidence but not really enough to put him away so the ending made me feel  like she was not the greatest investigator and the killer came off as being  stupid.  Not a bad first effort, but the plot had some holes that I could  not ignore.	2000-04-07

Blessings is one of my all-time favorites and it's a book that I'm always telling my friends (and even strangers in the black bookstores) to read when someone wants to read a &quot;good&quot; book.  I loved reading this book and sharing in the lives of Pat, Faye, Zuma, and Sandy.  For me, this  book had me feeling the full range of &quot;happy&quot; to  &quot;angry&quot; depending on the circumstances, but, from the beginning  to the end, this book really touched my heart.  At least one character is  practically guaranteed to make you &quot;hate&quot; her by the end of the  book but it's a great book that makes you FEEL something, in my opinion.  An excellent book that is very highly recommended!	2000-04-06

A fast-paced, &quot;gritty&quot; story of life in Detroit.  The main characters in the book, Jesse and Ramona, were both very believable characters and their lives, due to fate, crossed paths and they  found themselves needing each other for survival.  Anyone who likes  mysteries (books by Valerie Wilson Welsey or Hugh Holton, for instance) is  sure to enjoy this book.	2000-04-06

I bought this book a few years ago never hearing one word about whether or not the book was &quot;good&quot;.  They had copies on display in the bookstore and it sounded interesting so I took a chance.  Well, this is, was, and always will be one of my all-time favorites.  I really got into  both characters and I was very happy to see Gayle and Pat, two former best  friends get through their differences and problems with each other and  realize that true friendship never dies.

Absolutely awful pretty much sums up my feelings and from reading some of the other reviews, I feel like I'm not alone in my  feelings on this book.  I usually read a book in a week to two weeks but  this book literally took me MONTHS to finish.  It was so horrible that I  could only tolerate a few pages at a time before I'd have to put it down  again.  It was confusing and boring and not worth my time or anyone's time  for that matter.

I have read a lot of fiction books by black authors both male and female but one of the complaints I've had for a while, being a man, is that they don't ever seem to write any books with all men as the &quot;lead&quot;  characters.  With that said, I could NOT put this book down.  I loved  reading how the brothers interacted (and in some cases, DID NOT INTERACT)  with each other.  I loved seeing their father try to do something that was  on his heart and mind to do and that is to attempt to reconcile with the  three sons he abandoned 20 years earlier.  A fantastic book that men will  be able to relate to and it is also a great book for women to read as well.  Go out and buy this book!	2000-03-27

I've read a lot of books by the current crop of black authors but nothing has touched me and made me fall totally in love with a book like Mama Day. Like a lot of others said already, perhaps in different ways, this book was brilliant and I couldn't put it down until it was over. A good book is one of those books that you're actually sad when it's over. That was Mama Day for me. I have not read a book that comes close to it yet and I probably never will. If you have to read this book for school or a book club, I hope you enjoy it. If you want a book that is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED, this book is a MUST READ!	1999-12-01
