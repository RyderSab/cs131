TL Gardner is the most vivid and exciting author I've read in a long time. His books have more than PROMISE...they have DELIVERY.<br /><br />The main character Elijah is followed through his crisis of faith and love for one woman, Ebonee, with such passion that you cry with him, cheer with him and despite your hesitation...FIGHT with him against the forces of darkness. Whew! What a read. Don't miss out on this one.	2005-06-10
US	49437992	R3AXI7K2TKUZWW	1593090331	716590539	All That Drama	Books	5	1	1	N	N	Deserves the Kudos	All that drama is about two women-one who lives on drama, one who had drama forced to live on her.<br /><br />Written in first person, the story takes on the air of the author's voice completely. With strong language at times and realistic situations we read about Marie and Sammie, two unusual friends.<br /><br />Sammie, who is a magnet for trouble, meets Marie, who has spent a life time avoiding the mess.<br /><br />Of course, as with many of us, we are often curious about the `SPRINGERS' and how they get to be the way they are and is it real the terrible wild things the do? Well that is what I felt happened to Marie...curiosity. And we all know what happened to the cat that went down that road...enuff said.<br /><br />All that Drama is not your run of the mill URBAN FICTION variety. It was refreshing surprise, considering the genre it rides under. It was not a surprise that Ms. McKinney could tell a good story. It wasn't a surprise that Ms. McKinney could right a good story. The surprise was that...a person who is not one to pick up URBAN FICTION (due to the often explicit nature and overly graphic presentation of what life is like in the city), could really enjoy the story as much as I did. There was `intelligence,' in Ms. McKinney's storytelling and writing style that, unfortunately, for many books out there of this nature, today, is sorely missing. I so enjoyed that Mrs. McKinney was true to herself and didn't sell herself short by giving into the URBAN HYPE, that she didn't convince herself that if it says STREET, THUG, PIMP, HOE it's gonna sell...which we all know is not necessarily the case. Ms. McKinney dealt with urban issues in a way that proved that it's still the story that counts. I do HIGHLY recommend this book.	2005-02-17

I have to be honest it put me at a disadvantage...which is common when you go into a book blind. And I believe that is why many folks don't finish a book and then turn around and review it badly. And I have not commons on that because as an author, I've been in that position many times-which is why I read on, despite wondering where this book Quiet as Kept was going. I resisted reading the ending-which is another bad habit I have when going into a book blind.<br /><br />What was the result of my experiment? I enjoyed the book immensely. The story of Scott's family and all extended members was very entertaining. I always enjoy a story that shows what happens to the peripheral folks while the MAIN FOLKS go through things. Because it's not always about the ones something is happening too. Like for instance...in a car accident, sure there is the main person in the crash but what about the car parts that fly all over the place hitting the innocent guy walking down the street...he now has a story too.<br /><br />Lance had a story...Marshall had a story...Raymond had a story...<br /><br />It had a great climax at the right time with nice valleys on the way.<br /><br />I will say that not knowing the plot, the beginning of the story and the format of the chapters-the way they went from third person to first person, threw me, but I recovered quickly. However, in the end, as I mentioned before, it was all good and I highly recommend this book and look forward to more from Ms. Janet.	2005-02-17

I had thought it was about how the use of heavy religious based ideals helped a family solve issues from unresolved past secrets. However...it's not...not at all. The story took you inside flawed and weak humans who, through fear, clutched tightly to lies and secrets hoping they will simply go away, or better yet that they can simply carry them with them wherever they may go...however, as the author brings out, you can't take them with you, as there are no pockets in a shroud.<br /><br />The book takes you back to the days when the old folks whispered the word sex, and what we take for granted, was forbidden.<br /><br />Reading this book...again on the train, it took me several hours to get through it as it was deep with plot, although it had one storyline, the depth of that storyline, at times, had me a little confused about who was doing what. Eventually it all worked out and I fully got the jest of Ms. Thompson's rich tale of secrets revealed.<br /><br />Up to the last page...you are left guessing. It's definitely a sit on the sofa with a cup of cocoa and your full concentration read. You have to get fully into it to get all you need out of it. --M.M	2005-01-08

I enjoyed the strength of the character Phoenix Perry, showing her as a topnotch law enforcement agent as well as a mother and wife was done with a smooth flair that I can see is Mr. Johnson prides as his forte. The plot of the story is intersting, despite the fact the identity of the killer is reveal early on. I found it to be out of the ordinary. You would think that this would be where the twist lied...in finding out the true identity of of the killer ...to which I thought was going to turn out to be like, related to the protagonist, Phoenix Perry or something like that.<br /><br />The plot was very straight forward however, yet with subplots, such as the conflict between good and evi, the story is brought to full intensity. The dialog was a little dry for me however but it didn't take away from the story...and I have to realize they were law enforcement and therefore getting the `facts out' is often more important than snappy or impish dialog.<br /><br />There were a couple of parts I was actually holding my breath on and wondering how Mr. Johnson was going to pull off the `get around' but he did it and whew...was I glad.<br /><br />I highly recommend Pretenses for a club read. It didn't drag. --M.M.	2005-01-08

Rena Finney steps onto the mainstream platform with a book that tells a real story in a real way. The characters are not over the top or are they sappy and preachy. The progressive storyline is realistic and ends where you should expect it too. It's not designed to be (in my opinion) a brain twisting mystery nor a chest heaving hot romp...but a well told story.<br /><br />And it was.<br /><br />Rena Finney's freshman effort has me anxiously awaiting her next.	2005-01-07

Jacqueline Blue?s brush with the law had me in stitches. Yes, I know it was a serious situation, however, Ms. Diggs satirical use of dialog and language kept me chuckling throughout the entire book. The main character?s obsession for Victor was enough to carry the book, so yes; adding in all the rest made it ?the read of the year? for me.

I had to wonder how Rene would get out of many of the tangles she got herself into-the main one being that of escaping an obsessive ex.

Packed with deeper issues than just a teenager trying to experiment with sex-Wild Innocence, by Moody Holiday, deals with Shannelle, a young girl on the cusp of becoming a full-blown woman. Shannelle has a lot on her plate, what, with trying to make decisions that will affect the rest of her life, all the while dealing with a crazy home life. I think Ms. Moody did a good job of putting in forgotten 80's morality. While you read it, you have to remember the timing of the storyline. Ms. Moody did an excellent job of making the reader go...oh yeah, that's right, that's how it was. Written in first person there is a strong narrative and heavy story telling. For me personally, I am finding that like a bit more dialog than this story had, even though the narrative did not drag in the least and the story was well told. The ending had me flipping back; I thought I might have missed something, considering how sexually curious Shannelle was, but I didn't the ending was just as I read it.<br />The subtle depth of the background story Shannelle's, drug addicted brother, his violence, perversions and impact on a family, is deeper than the forefront story, and it too was well presented. I gave the book five stars because my personal preference for more dialog, should not be figured in with my rating of the book. I highly recommend it for a person who wants something a little different.<br />The subtle depth of the background story Shannelle's, drug addicted brother, his violence, perversions and impact on a family, is deeper than the forefront story, and it too was well presented.

I enjoyed the way the Author, showed how different women could still have the same problem with the Type of man-Brice.<br />The ending surprises and the twist and turns of the story shocked and at one point I actually put the book down and pondered the main character's actions for a moment...okay, I was ticked.

Descriptive sexual scenes from the male point of view had me already pre-judging the content of the book, however, within just a few pages I was taken away by a storyline that so much deeper and more complex. I was up into the WEE hours finishing this book...it was indeed a page turner, as I truly didn't know what was going to happen.

Oh sure, I could have just read it for a good time, but I knew there was something going on here with this MS. RAVEN. And after I started the book I knew I'd have to read fast to find out what. I'd been hearing alot about this book in different groups that I'm a part of and so finally I braved a peek and THERE IT WAS...a strong storyline. I was totally engrossed after just the first chapter.<br />Raven's mind set was not one that most of us would call normal...or reasonable but for fiction, which takes a real situation and makes it bigger or more fantastic or unbelievable than it would be...Raven's mind set was right on.<br />I don't think Ms. Tilles was planning on writing a book that would go down in history as a literary classic. But I do think Ms. Tilles wrote herself a book that could be read all the way through and appreciated within the genre for which it was intended. I think Ms. Tilles took serious subjects----betrayal, lust, unbridled sexual appetite, vengence, adultry, personal orientation----all that, and put it in a fashion to where she could make a point for those who were looking for one, yet, have fun with those who were not! And for those who missed both boats...ah well, another book that was just NOT FOR YOU.<br />The only thing missing was Ms. Tilles disclaimer: REAL PEOPLE, don't try any of this stuff at home...in the office...in the tub...in your car...on your head...etc...etc...<br />Looking forward to your next venture Ms. Tilles...and you're off to a strong start with that one as well!	2003-07-23

I suppose it was the ending bummed me out. It was like...huh? I was kinda let down. It was good though and Ed McBain's references to THE BIRDS and other works of his (that some readers may not be aware that he wrote) cracked me up. The book does age itself with many popular references but that's ok. Sometimes, due to the fact that the series takes place over such a LONG SPAN of time, it's kinda nice to catch up.<br />I enjoyed the infusion of Ollie Weeks...though I thoroughly dislike that man! I did enjoy the way he was allowed to solve the case involving Marie--though I would have rather had my guys from the 87th do it! (smile)All in all I enjoyed the book as much as Romance--another book that was just 'okay'.<br />I did enjoy Carella speaking the Italian, however. Nice touch.	2003-03-28

I could not believe the character Jennifer. She was believable. I just couldn't believe her. I didn't feel like she had changed all that much in the end, except to think that maybe she would be able to direct her energy and directness in a positive way, but TACTFULLY-no. I don't feel she learned her lesson.<br />Yolanda and Kyle's relationship puzzled me. Maybe it's just me but I didn't understand how he could `get over' one thing but not the other! It seems to me that he should have either been mad about it ALL or nothing! And I feel with Yolanda's good looks and talent, that she should work on being a stronger person. (I know its fiction, but still...)<br />Joya I could understand. She was a private person who was constantly being invaded on. I don't feel like her friends used her for her money, however, her mother sure did and that was terrible. I don't feel any of that was fixed, though Joya sure tried. She was working hard and with A LOT of things going on!<br />It was a good read with very colorful characters. I didn't have a problem with the movement of the story, though sometimes I did get a little lost in the dialog, but as with a lot of books you just have to keep going and come back if ya have too!<br />Congrats Monica on your successful efforts and I look forward to reading your next venture. You would be a GREAT mystery writer; your energy just jumps off the page! I could just see you penning that high-speed chase. I felt it.  Good Job.	2003-03-04

I didn't feel satisfied with Stacy's lot. Though I'm sure many were ready for Rikki to `just quit it!' and YES I did suspect certain aspects of the ending, nonetheless, I had hoped for something bigger to happen, something that would make for a difference. I still felt as though Stacy `settled' for life in a silent hell-much too far away from happiness, even after it all played out.<br />Five stars? Yes, because the story was affecting-touching. It was deep enough to draw out emotions. I recommend the book for many. But for me, the book was too real, (not necessarily a bad thing) without enough silver linings. - M.	2003-02-04

I absolutely LOVE E.Palfrey's books. So I kinda took my time about opening this book. I figured I'd read on the weekends and what not...but NO! I picked it up, opened it and couldn't put it down until finished. I read on the busses, my breaks, etc. It hooked me from the first page. I love the subtle mystery of Ms. Palfrey's style. You get so personally involved with Bobbie and her issues. I found myself sizing up Ray as if he was a real man about to date my best friend.<br />Darlene's prodical return (not knowing how Bobbie would handle it) touched me and Sonny's behavior towards his father was unexpected.<br />Everything In Its Place was a perfect title for this 'fit together' story.<br />I was left mostly satisfied....<br />Mostly?

What a great book this turned out to be. I had a feeling I was going to enjoy it, just form the authors synopsis of it, but never did I think I would be so personally touched by many of the situations E found herself in--with her men, with her friends. There was so much truth in the tales told here. Ms. Mahdi touched me deeply with this book and I want to share it with everyone. I read it in a day and I'm sure by the time it gets through my daughters it will be time for me to read it again. Sure, it's a mature book and not for the skittish but it's told the way it really is and for some of us...was.

It was as if reading about an old friend instead of tight and formal...like when you read about a character the first time. There was a big twist as usual and an unlikely killer. I love the way they get to the killer without boring me, simply because all of the characters are so well written. If it was my first McBain I would have given it 4 stars as it was not a very deep or strongly written novel...but since I'm an 87th precinct fan and know the characters it was as if I turned on the TV and watched another good episode of my favorite series.	2002-07-26

In a sequel sometimes you are looking for more perils for the characters to go through. But as with the long lasting TV show FRIENDS...sometimes it's just the everyday events in the lives of people that make for good reading.<br />Sandy again was the main character...looking for love. Which is tricky with the death of her husband Adrian from AIDS. Some times that can make your next true love--hard to find. But in her case love was waiting but was he REALLY the one for her--or possibly was he suffering from the same amount of grief and looking to replace what was loss...I wonder. I was surprised with what happened to Janice. I always thought she had more confidence than that.But then I guess even the toughest person can just plain ol have enough some time. The other characters Martha and Britney add to the flavor of the book with their 'drama'. Though the book does deal with female relationships I did enjoy the maturity of the characters in this sequel...I enjoyed Butterscotch Blues but in Some Sunday, I could see the characters growth... except for Janice...poor thing. But all in all it was very involving book. there was something to glean and take away from every character.<br />Looking forward to reading Margaret Johnson Hodges' newest release coming this fall!	2002-05-29

I read for relaxation or entertainment and I found this book to be BOTH. Reading it on the train I finished it in about 4 hours and boy was it good. I kinda had it figured out by the end but it was a fun ride getting there. I enjoyed the characters and how they were developed and I really liked the familar setting of the plot. I kept wondering if I had seen the house that the main character lived in. It was a good read.	2002-02-22

When I started writing, I thought to myself, I want to be just like her!<br />I loved the character development that carried over time. I loved the way you answered but yet `didn't answer questions, thus allowing the reader to THINK for themselves. I hope that my books are as haunting as I found this one to be. I couldn't put it down...and it was a pretty big HARDBACK to carry around back then (smile)	2002-02-22

Her technique is sharp and carries a story well. The chapters being split, with each character having their own, is a very nice touch and frankly-- not that easy a task to pull off! The storyline held me from beginning to end. I just loved the depth of character description. I could see each and every person clearly. AND the first chapter--well lets just say I could even HEAR the saw! OUCH!<br />Thanks for all your help. You are a WONDERFUL person and a GREAT writer.	2002-02-22

I must say it unfolded in ways I would have never thought and the characters inner thoughts were revealed through their actions, making it an surprising read. I enjoyed it. What happens to the roommates made for a story within itself.	2002-02-22

She didn't move me as much as her father did in the original story. She was a little harder than I thought she would be. I did like the way she was tamed by her brother. However, he faded out of the storyline and I thought he should have played a bigger part in her life than just her lawyer.	2002-02-22

It's definitely designed for a person with a LARGER command of the Spanish language. Perhaps it's a good book to BRUSH up an INTERMEDIATE Spanish student but it's not for beginners.	2002-02-22

There is a personal touch and flare to this deep subject...yet the touch of 'story-telling' keeps one reading on to the end. It was warm and smooth moving. I enjoyed the read! Keep up the good work and I look forward to your next book. You are a really strong and confident writer!	2001-12-14
US	49437992	RHWA2KGMYGA6G	067104222X	993581643	Dangerous Dilemmas	Books	5	1	1	N	N	A very engrossing read	When I started this book I could not put it down. There was something about Audrey's realism as a woman and a mother that drew me in and kept me there. She was funny, smart and human. The man that stole her heart was strong and mature. He was older and I liked that. He showed her that 'together' is the only way to work out a problem...though, I must at admit, in the begining he seemed to be settled into some OLD thinking about kids. I found my self near tears when Audrey's health issue came up. It was so touching and found a deep place in my space as I too could relate to trying to have a relationship while 'sick'. I nearly cried. But all in all it was a book for all reasons...my reading reasons, that is.	2001-11-18

Back in the seventies when I read it, it was my most favorite book of all time. It was one of the first books I completed and I have to say it spurred me on to become a romance writer. Though I write multi-cultural romance with a strong leaning towards African American themes, Seventeenth Summer was written color-blind. I could relate to the teenage feelings back then... they were what we ALL went through one or twice in our lives.	2001-09-27

As a fellow author (romance fiction...write it, don't read it...I read Mystery fiction)But I know the effort it takes to finish a manuscript, one that doesn't reflect the total excitment we feel when getting what we know to be a WONDERFUL story off our minds. Idelia's story is just that...A wonderful story thats paced and poised, graceful in it's delivery. I also know that HALF way through we just can't WAIT to know what our readers think... so I was reading... at work... at home...in lines.. ONLINE... and then I go.. WAIT a minute... I'm loving this and I need to tell her! Connor is a wonderful character full of BELIEVEABLE ability. Martin, Paxton, Hayes are GREAT male characters... developed thoroughly and believably. I could just see them lusting the poor woman at every turn.(smile)The build up to the kidnapping was not over set. The inner workings of the characters brains, helped the readers to feel the growing suspense. It was like choreography...Very well done. All I know was that I couldn't LAUGH hard enough at the restaurant scenes... they were GREAT! Well, let me continue reading this 5 star book! On to its climax I'm right there...the Sedan is closing in! Can't put it down!	2001-08-24

Though the character Sara has a lot of 'sass' she's very deep and well thought out. She's a sista that you wouldn't mind hangin with. Her choices in the end will catch you by surprise. I think Ms. Sloan is extremely talented in weaving a story that is not too soapy sweet that you just 'can't believe it' or to 'homegirl gritty' that your Afro is scorched by the time you get finished... (if you can get finished). It was a good blend of smooth and real. I like a main character that you can get mad at and forgive and fall out with and make up with again...all to a satisfying end...even if the end is unexpected. Along the way there were a few zingers too, I might add. Very good read, VERY good write. Look forward to your next venture Gayle. Five HIGH stars.	2001-08-15

Nana was so good, I wish Ms. Poitier-Henderson would consider making this a film. It reminded me of the old Cary Grant movies, like &quot;Arsenic and Old Lace&quot; Filmed in black and white. (smile) The characters of Nana were lively and happy and RIGHT up to the end, the story was face paced and moving. Never a dragging moment. Pamela, Bert, Nana and &quot;the People&quot; come together through some really funny times and I have to say... the fight scene was hilllarious! I could just picture it! The plot was deep enough to make it through the laughs too! Some comedies are just funny and afterwards you ask yourself ... what was that all about? but Nana's plot was rich. It was an overall GOOOD read! Looking forward to more from Beverly.	2001-08-08
US	49437992	R1EGCXV0C3G6NC	1876962011	206635871	Tempered Hearts	Books	3	2	2	N	N	Very well written	Tempered Hearts was written in a strong voice that spoke volumes to 'Christian' fiction. It was realistic and romantic, but without overwhelming us with too much 'morality checking'. The story was allowed to shine through the message. I have to hand it to Pam, the book was a good read, one I encouraged my daughters to enjoy.	2001-08-08

So I can only review the style of writing which I could find no flaw with. Some times when a story is written about the days of 'wrath'...with all the  Dis Dats Foots and Feets....it's over done. It's written to where the reader can't get past whats written to get the sense of  the story. I didnt' find that problem here. The writing was clear. The story was a strong tale of time and passage with Lifee as the main character. I'm just into lighter reads. I do recommend this book to those who like a meaningful read. I think they will find it here.	2001-06-21

By the end of the book I was like SOOO done with all of them. But then I realized HEY I read the whole thing... In 4 hours! So it must have been good! (smile) It was just like old home week though. I know all those women (types) and they get on my nerves...They did in my 20's and 30's and tried to, in my 40's, until I said ENOUGH! They know they can't live without each other!But they need to start living without those MEN! Well, Sandy and Adrian... that was the story of the hour to me and probably most people that read this book. Ending the way you did...with the dread that stays with many who have loved someone new in the last 10 years... was very haunting. I'm just glad I'm an older woman without that constant worry of where love will come from next or even if it's GONNA COME. Whew... what a life that used to be. GOOD STORY. Sad reminder... real reality bite. I will pass it on to my daughter.	2001-04-04

I happened upon this author in my search for an African American P.I. Boy did I find one in Lincoln Keller... and an entertaining one at that. I'm hooked! The smart banter and quick wit of the author transcends into the characters and I had a smile on my face every time I picked the book up(even before opening the pages). I have always enjoyed a good 'Mickey Spilane type' narrative and I was not left lacking in this novel. The storyline of the 'Sentiments Search' was kept lively with twists and turns... of course being a mystery buff from way back...I expected them and rode with them like a champ! GOOD JOB... You'll be hearing from this new fan again...With more HIGH marks I'm sure! Great reading... I recommend Linc to everyone looking for a good P.I.	2001-03-19

The introspection was RIGHT ON TIME and carried me over any of my 'HUH?' spots. I was very entertained. I am looking forward to starting the sequel. Ms. Stevens has a very comfortable style of writing that shows ease, class and sophistication--it says I KNOW WHO I AM AND WHAT I WANT TO SAY! HEY LADY!! YOUR CONFIDENCE IS SHOWING!!!

I was thrilled to find a poison that was pretty close to just what I was using. The book told the exact effects that I needed, in doing away with the bad guy.

That is what I depend on this series of books to do... fill me in. At three a.m...I just want to know one or two little facts that add realism to a small scene. This book was a very helpful reference guide...who comes first to the scene of a crime. Who ask the questions? Who gathers the clues? You only get so much from watching Murder She Wrote.	2000-11-28

The plot was well developed. It did not drag. Considering the length, it read like a short story. It was very clean and sharp. Her characters were well developed and well fitted to their roles. I don't feel any of them acted in a way other than what was expected. Sometimes you look for some big shocking thing to happen, sometimes you just want to read along and see where a story takes you. I can't say there were any real SHOCKS but boy there sure were alot of...GOTCHAs. I laughed out loud often as once again the fact was made known...Payback is a bear! Good job, can't wait for the next one.	2000-11-25

I read it in one setting as it held me totally captive. Darryl was the man I knew. He was my bestfriend's man. He is the man next door that you see creeping in at all hours. He's real and he makes you feel something for him. The women he went through they were real. It was so strong a peice I was aching in my heart when I finished.
