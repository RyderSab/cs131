I just about quit reading this one because it was a little more \\"graphic\\" than I like, but I did finish it and am glad I did.  Koontz writes an intelligent and engulfing story. I look at his picture on the jacket and can't imagine that such a delightfully pleasant looking man can possibly carry such devious plots of murder and perversion in his head.  He does have a mishevious twinkle in his eye, however. I always enjoy the perspective Koontz provides between good and evil, and, somehow, I am left with a peaceful feeling at the end, even though, at times the evil seems so encompassing.	2005-07-18

I enjoyed skipping around from what was happening in real life and what was happening in the story the characters in the book were reading. The bad guys were scarry and added some tension.  I may reread this book again.  That's saying alot, because I've only read 2 fiction books twice--Jane Eyre and the Poisonwood Bible.	2004-11-07

The style was unique, even though it was a little puzzling for the first 3 chapters.  The book provides brief snipets in the lifes of several owners of the same portrait.  Vermeer may be the artist, but the portrait is unsigned so it's authenticity is questionable.  Chapter one takes place in modern times.  Each successive chapter takes place further into the past.  The last chapter is about a brief time in Vermeer's life.  I felt somewhat disappointed at not being able to follow a direct line from the last owner back to Vermeer, but that disappointment added an facet of interest--it makes me long for more.  I've only read 2 fiction books twice (Jane Eyre and Poisonwood Bible), but I started rereading this book the day after completing it. Here's hoping Vreeland continues to write.	2004-11-07

I thought Despereaux, Mig, and even Chiaroscuro were very loveable.  For young readers the message that not all good people are all good and that not all bad people are all bad is very worthwhile.  I was pleased with the ending - more realistic than beauty and the beast.	2004-04-18

I have read 3 or 4 William Monk books, but didn't pay any attention to order.  I have really enjoyed them, so I thought I would start at the first and read them all in order.  Now I more clearly understand about Monk's amnesia.  It was really fun learning about Monk's 1st meeting with Hester Latterly.  Great ending, although I felt very sympathetic to the killer.  I love Anne Perry's books.  Next, I'll probably read the Thomas Pitt novels in order.	2004-03-16

I've visited the San Juans twice and envied Rae's sojurn there, although not during winter or roughing it.  I highly recommend this book, although I don't think it's the thriller others did.  Very good story, great characters, good mystery about Uncle Desmond, and some suspense at the end.  Laurie King is an intelligent writer.	2004-03-06

He has such a grasp on good and evil.  His characters are well developed and I really care about what happens to them.  My favorite Koontz was &quot;From the Corner of His Eye,&quot; but I love to be wrapped up in any of his suspenseful stories.  This one contains lots of humor as well as Koontz's wornderful descriptions.	2004-01-30

I probably read  40-50 books a year and this is onmy favorites list along with Jane Eyre, Poisonwood Bible, Crispin, Inkheart and books by such authors as Dean Koontz and Anne Perry.<br /><br />I fell in love with the main character, Rose.  Her personality is well-developed and she is very likeable.  There are questions which develop in your mind as you read and, one by one, they are addressed.  You find yourself cheering for Rose and heartbroken right along with her.  She has some tough decisions to make and you are not always so sure she's doing the right thing.<br /><br />I hope you will read this book.  I think you'll be glad you did.	2004-01-20

My 14-yr-old daughter received this book for Christmas, but is reading The Lord of the Rings trilogy right now.

At first I thought the events seemed very improbable and I still did at the end, but it was such a splendid yarn with enough mystery and uplift of the spirit, that I really enjoyed it.  My favorite character is the little Scout.  What a remarkable child.  It was easy to identify with Jamie, because we all have our weaknesses, but are trying to find our way to finding whatever it is that will provide us with a sweet smile at death.  I think I will read more by this author.	2003-10-20

I would recommend it to those who enjoy mysteries with intricate, twisting plots, but could do without strong language and goriness,  Well written, intriguing storyline, likable characters, etc.  I read and enjoy MHC when I need a good escape.

If you do read this book, glean from the stories of other women, but be careful.	2000-12-29
