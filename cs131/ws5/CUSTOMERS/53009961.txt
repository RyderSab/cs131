The latter on words.<br /><br />He recommends getting a \\"clear, concise\\" idea of what you are going to write. Not the general idea that's so easy to think about.<br /><br />His idea of reviewing for \\"macro,\\" \\"micro,\\" & \\"sentences\\" is excellent.<br /><br />Such \\"small\\" things as these (and many others) are what make this an excellent book.<br /><br />***<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />He leaves out a lot of steps that needs to be done in the Thinking/Focusing phase. Nowhere does he mention building characters. Or worldbuilding/setting.<br /><br />He implies (though there is a sentence or two \\"unimplying\\") that you need only rewrite a novel once.<br /><br />A few of his sections could have been \\"re-focused\\" better. I still don't understand the Stack Test.<br /><br />A few of his section could have been cut without any harm.<br /><br />***<br /><br />Overall: Yes, this will speed up your writing, regardless if you Speed Write your first draft (as he recommends) or not. Just having a systematic, step-by-step plan, to follow through the rough days will help.<br /><br />Those \\"write-by-the-seat-of-your-pants\\" can ignore the \\"Focus\\" part, or do it A.F.S.T.<br /><br />***<br /><br />He even has a CD out now, 11 Mistakes that Slow You Down.	2005-10-04

(or read the book)	I've listened to 2 of  the six tapes of Emotional Genius: How Emotions Can Save Your Life & it's wonderful.<br />She says we are made up of 4 \\"parts\\" that should all be equal: intelligence, feelings, body, spirit. (She calls them fire, water, earth & air which bothers me a little but not too much.) The four parts form a fifth, You.  After the second tape, I kept trying to picture my four parts forming one. I now see me as a 4-headed, 4-bodied conjoined quad!  &lt;HA! HA> But it loosened up my feelings a bunch. Had terrible nightmares, but they didn't make my heart pound & sweat. Just like she says, the other parts help process the feelings.<br />She's religious in that she believes in God, but doesn't preach. Also referred to other names.<br />If you don't think people can communicate with animals, the beginning might bother you.<br />She is a \\"survivor\\" (I prefer the word \\"Victor\\") of child sexual molestation. Makes me feel good as to how Whole she has become.<br />She compares what she believes with other \\"systems\\" and she says they are trying to make you just feel the \\"good\\" feelings, not the \\"bad\\" feelings, but both type can be and are healthy for you in some instances. And that contrary to some spiritual teachings, Judgment IS good. Not Judgment of others, but Judgment if something or someone or some belief is good for you, ie don't let someone else tell you to only believe what they say. Think & feel for yourself.<br />And that's only in two tapes! Actually, 1 1/2 since I haven't listened to the second part of the second tape.	2004-05-17

A great idea, but it could have been as good as any of Dan Brown's books with some work shopping and professional look.<br />The material is there to have a great historical thriller: a man has a vision that tells him to find the 3 parts of a gospel and ordered to go forth and find them. What a tale that telling would be, perhaps hounded and followed by the Religious Right that doesn't want him to find them. Then a scene with some immediacy as he finds each of the three and the last one dies before he learns all he must! And he has to understand what these gospels are saying.<br />Instead that man easily finds all three parts and when the third person dies before he gets the last of the gospel, that part is literally handed to him by someone who knocks on his door! No suspense.<br />And to lower suspense even more, the book is put to print by the supposed current-day grandson of the man who did found these gospels.<br />And the fantastic suspense could be drawn out by him having to have someone help him understand the gospels, comparing them to the Bible and implying what the difference means.<br />Or, if the gospels were really all from Lucifer's view point, instead of omniscient.<br />As it is, the gospels are 3/4 of the book and not fast reading, nor as beautifully written as the Bible. It has all the pronouns referring to all the deities capitalized which makes you pause. Trying to compare the writing as in the book with your memory of the Bible (and mine is good) makes it slow reading.<br />And the ending is such a let down!<br />The writing itself needed a few more passes to even up the writing. Some parts are fairly well done and could have been great; most are acceptable and could have been brought up to at least good.<br />Now for some nitpicking.<br />I mentioned the capitalized letters above. Any line editor would have said to kill these. Maybe they did and he ignored the advise. Any book editor would have insisted these not be capitalized because it implies that the teller of the story, Satan supposedly, thinks that they are gods.<br />The Thee and Thou is way overused. It has its place, but not as used.<br />If there were line editors, they missed a bunch of errors.<br />I love his answer to some of the Bible's unanswered questions and inconsistencies. The ideas are great, but the book could have been really great with more work.<br />Self publishing is the rave, why pay an agent 10-20% of your royalty, when you can have it all? Why wait 2 years for your book to come out from a main stream book club, when it can come out in 90days?<br />Most of the time, I agree. But this is a book that would have be benefitted greatly from the reviews and suggestions made during that process. As it is, he published with iUniverse/Writers Club Press.<br />I'm sure he's made a good bit of money.

Refreshingly, Jeremy is only 13 when the first case, BLIND JUSTICE, starts. The storyteller, the now mature Fielding, tenderly shows his childhood assumptions and lack of knowledge (even of sex).<br />London of 1768 comes alive through the awe and excitement of young Jeremy and the wonderful descriptive skill of Bruce Alexander. Descriptions of people are given not only from the young boy's view point, but also from the him describing the person to the magistrate and Sir John's knowledge of the person by observation with other than his eyes.<br /><br />Even though the reader easily catches on to who murdered whom, the lack of young Jeremy's knowledge is the string that pulls the reader forward through the book. In order to keep some knowledge from the reader, young Jeremy is sent from the room by Sir John. Yet by doing so, the reader guesses what knowledge has been departed. It still works in this book because it is so refreshing to have a likable young protagonist.<br /><br />But if this is going to be the plot mechanism standard to all the books, it will soon become tiresome.<br /><br />If in his second book, MURDER IN GRUB STREET, I find a slightly smarter and more street-wise kid, I will continue to read the series and watch as young Jeremy grows to manhood.<br /><br />Well done. Highly recommended.	1997-10-02
