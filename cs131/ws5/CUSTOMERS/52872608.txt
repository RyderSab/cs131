I was reluctant to buy it because the price was up there---and I had no idea if it was a hardcover, paperback, spiral bound manuscript, or even if it contained anything I would find new and useful. But I figured it was tax deductible and worth a shot. After all, curiosity is a powerful motivator, and it got to me but good that day. The book is actually breathtaking.  I was VERY surprised to see it is written well (many NLP books aren't), that it contains practical examples of how to use NLP in writing sales letters or making telemarketing calls, and that the book, in general, probably contains the best definitions and explanations of NLP I've ever seen. And it's all aimed, as the subtitle explains, to giving you &quot;Practical applications of NLP for sales and marketing.&quot;<br />I'm also a little nervous that this type of heavy-duty artillery may get into the wrong hands, but I'm only letting my trusted friends and peers know about it.

I took a chance on this book and it's turning out to be a &quot;must have.&quot; Some of the stuff you may already know (headlines and copy tips), but all of it is based on solid research, which could be handy  ammunition later when standing your ground on a point with a client. Other  things were new to me, such as 50 ways to position a product, what layouts  work best, and the hidden meaning of colors. (That last one fascinates me.)  Some of the book reminds me of my own &quot;AMA Complete Guide to Small  Business Advertising,&quot; but I think Dupont either did a better job than  me or at least created a necessary companion volume to my book. At any  rate, I think it's more than worth the $20 price on the cover. As we say  here in Texas, &quot;Go Git Et!&quot;	1999-08-10

I had no idea who Roberts was when I picked up his book. But good gawd I am impressed! This guy is ballsy and brash and inspiring. He belongs in my book on P.T. Barnum, &quot;There's a Customer Born Every Minute.&quot; I  admire him for coming out of nowhere, with nothing, and making millions  with sheer balls, hard work, and plenty of honesty. An absolutely terrific  book! Reading it feels like being at a high action boxing match or  basketball game. Riveting!	1998-11-29

What a surprise! I stumbled across this one and devoured it. Reiman closed his ad agency and opened the first ideation, where his only product his ideas---which he sells for $450,000 each! This is truly a mind expanding work. I particularly loved the concept  of being sure I get paid--and paid well---for what I create. I've helped  several people become millionaires, but lost money in the process because I  didn't honor my own ideas. Reiman doesn't make that mistake. His excitement  for living, his boldness for thinking out of the box, is contagious and  refreshing. This is a guy who is truly a creative genius. Had I known about  him when I wrote my book on P.T. Barnum, &quot;There's a Customer Born  Every Minute,&quot; I would have included Joey Reiman in it. That's a high  compliment and this book is terrific. It's one of the few I'll re-read.	1998-11-11
