Anyone on a reading level above the 8th grade may want to look for something with a little more substance. Is O'Reilly a simpleton? No, he's a Harvard graduate. He just seems to be dishing out common sense in a language that everyone can understand. The book is short; not even 200 pages. I would recommend it to teenagers and maybe young adults. However, anyone over the age of 22 should know this stuff already.  If you are looking for informative and interesting social commentary for adults, I recommend &quot;The Ten Things You Can't Say in America&quot; by Larry Elder. This is much better reading material.	2000-12-22

Journalistic writing and pithy T.V. talking head shows are two differnet things. This was his chance to prove his journalistic integrity and maybe flash some of that Harvard education. However, this man is not stupid. He was smart enough to know he could cash in on the vulgar and ignorant masses. This book was a disappointment.	2000-12-22

Most women today work full-time and do all the household chores and tend to the children. It's also time for husbands to take on some of that responsibility as well. Also, we set a better example for our daughters when they can be proud of their mothers who are not simply &quot;hubby's little helper&quot; (unpaid prositute, cook and house-cleaner).

Don't get me wrong, I don't mind women  who choose to stay home and take care of their children. It's their choice.  However, plodding through this simple book, I was horrified when I got to  the chapter where it was implied that working mothers were responsible for  the Columbine massacre as well as the rest of the country's current  tragedies and troubles. I personally find this female backlash very  insulting. My mother worked from the time I could crawl and I have never  thought about suicide, bringing a gun to school, or ever harming another  human being. I have never been in jail and I am a successful, well-adjusted  and content individual.  Kaufman and Quigley should be recognized for their  achievements in the fields of education and freelance writing, however,  they don't understand how things work in the real world. In the real world,  people can't just decide to write a book or an article after raising their  kids. For them back to work means much, much more and many of them, when  they return to work, are pained to find that their jobs have been given to  much younger and much more experienced women who did not spend too much  time out of the job market. They realize that they've lost years of  valuable experience and now they are too old to re-learn (or learn, for  that matter) what everbody else already knows. Getting back in is really  tough. A long hiatus is definitely not recommended. I guess if you've  married well and you don't have to work for a living, you can enjoy the  luxury of being a stay-at-home-mom (and yes it is a luxury - my mom worked  full-time, while raising a family).	2000-08-18
