The characters good and evil are quirky and full of depth. It start with the main character,Joey,  being tossed over a cruise ship by her husband, Chaz.  It is here that I knew the book we be a wild ride. Throughout the book you meet a retired detective who falls for Joey after he saves her from her watery grave. She and the detective devise a plan to seek revenge on Chaz. Chaz is a supossed marine biologist that works for a crooked boss. We also meet a character who is kind of a \\"hit man\\" for the boss who's hobby is to collect crosses on the side of the road left in memory for people who have die in car crashes. I apologize for not remembering his name I already started a new book by this author I liked this so much. Each person is so well developed that the reader can actually get a picutre in their mind of their physical appearance as well as their personailty.  The author does such a good job that I felt like I knew these people like friends. The only one I did not think was represented well was the detective. I got an idea of his physical appearance but not what he was like personally.  The scenes described in the everglades also made me feel like I was right there with the widllife and the \\"muck\\".Without revealing to much the book takes on twists and turns that are more fun than a roller coaster ride. I highly recommend this book and I will be reading lots more of this author's books.	2005-08-03

Trudy is hilarious. Her comments about her life are touched with saddness but somehow she finds the humor in them. When Trudy talks about her clay art work and how it looks and makes her creative side feel it is as if she is relating to them as her only friends.  I certainly do not mean that in a \\"crazy way.\\" It shows to me that most of her relationships with people have been dissapointing and lack excitment. Her ex- boyfriend was certainly a live  by the seat of your pants guy who made everything an adventure. Even eating out with this man was an experience that rivaled most amusment Parks. He made Trudy feel beautiful and loved by his gestures and feelings. He hid nothing and I thnk that is why she was so attracted to him. But again he lets her down just like all people in her life. <br /> <br />I think this is the reason she agrees to be a surraget mother to a wealthy couple. Trudy seems to think that since her own life is not really wants she hoped for maybe she can find it by providing someone else with a child that hopefully will be able to grow up in a loving enviroment. What she finds is not what she expected. I hate to sound trite but money is not going to help in this case. <br /> <br />This book is so well wrritten that even the bad situations are humorous. Sarah Bird is able to do this by not making fun of the characters but developing them so they all realize the absurdity in their own actions. It is difficult in my mind to find a book with bitter sweetness that is at all interesting. I highly recommend this book. I am sure I will be buying more of her books to read.	2005-07-17

I thought the main character Lily was precocious and endearing.I felt her pain while living with her abusive father T.Ray. The only bright light at home is her &quot;housekeeper&quot;, Rosealeen. She is an African American woman doing her best to take care of Lily and soften the blow of her father's wrath.  The  book includes the mystery of Lily's mother's death whioch leads her on a wonderful journey. A series of events that includes Rosealeen spitting tocacco on a white man's shoes causes the pair to run away to a different town where they meet three remarkable African American women who change both their lives. May, August, and June are the women. These women raise bees and make honey. This sounds dull but it turns into an adventure for Lily. They all struggle together to find theri own identities. The process allows them to learn things about themselves and each other that are remarkable and life changing.  I read a review by a customer who said that this book was not beleivable. There are certain events that take place that are emotional and seem preventable. I am sure that the writer of this book did her research. She grew up during the time of sixties racial strife. I certainly think she has a good grasp of life in the south during this time. This holds true particularly where she describes the struggles between African Americans and whites. I am sure that even then there were strong African American women who broke the rules all the time regardless of the consquences. Their actions may have seemed stupid or just plain dangerous. I call it courageous. It sure started the change towards a better life and rights for the African American. Every change starts with one small voice and/or action.	2004-03-10
US	52182246	R2HGGR2XLG8IEF	0446532452	935112124	The Wedding	Books	3	0	4	N	Y	Romantic and Sappy......	This is the first book I have read by Nicholas Sparks. It is about a couple that falls out of love later in theie life, and how the husband struggles to rebuild their relationship. I beleive this is a worthy effort by the author. Wilson the husband is a career driven man who thinks the way to please his family is to make lots of money and in the process ends up ignoring his family's emotional needs. He is particlarly a bad husband to his wife Jane. Throughout the story he is trying to rekindle their passion for each other and make up for his shortcomings. I certain ways the story is enduring and sweet. In other ways in reminds me of a soap opera being played oput in book form. I did enjoy the family dynamics and was very taken in by the love story between Jane's father and passed away mother. It was only mentioned here and there in the book but it was riviting. I think I would have actually liked to hear more about their love story than what was going on between Wilson and his wife. I think if you like novels that are along the lines of a better written Daniel Steele Romance this is the one for you. The ending is too predictble and things go along way too smopothy throughout the book. Life is not a romantic fantasy waiting to happen and I don't beleive the people can change that fast from being non-emotional to suddenly romantic.	2003-12-07

I was apprehensive about this book because of the affair between a 40 year-old and a 15 year old. (I beleive another reader said the same thing.) However, while you delve into this book you can understand why it happened. The girl was educated at home by her father and he made sure she was well-read and intelligent enough to carry on conversations with adults. He was a well-respected and wealthy man who needed his daughter to pocess these skills. I beleive since her mother was often sickly he was sort of using his daughter has a surragate wife without any sexual overtones. It all made sense that she would pick an older man to love. She was mature way beyond her years, the time was the 1800's and she was smart. Now you would think at a time like that it was especially scandulous. It was but it also made the relationship more beleivable. I have always gotten the feeling that women were a bit more sophisticated during that time out of need more than anything else. In order to find a husband you did have to learn the \\"duties\\" of being a good wife. Especially if you were poor and wanted to find a rich husband.  These duties included things  like a good conversationlist, a good mother, a women who is able to run a household in genral, and be subservant to her husband. The modern woman of today would  mostly scolf at some of these things. This is no Mary Kay Louretourno ( pardon my spelling) story. It is full of romance, heartache, lies, and emotional intrigue. A  very good read.	2003-06-09
US	52182246	R2FZ819STVF8E9	037541214X	723191315	The Yokota Officers Club	Books	5	2	3	N	Y	Funny; touching; real; could not put it down	...This book brought to life  both the transient life of a family in the armed forces  and the narrow-mindedness of some military wives. I was  intrigued by the  Root family in this book. The wife, Moe Root, had learned to accept her husband's traveling in the beginning with a sense of adventure. However, it was obvious has the children got older she became bored and lonely. I really liked the way that she did not conform to the usual behavior of a \\"I am better than you\\" officers wife that is so prevalent in the military.It is almost like these women think they are their husband's rank...I also liked the way the kids has such different personalities. The Root children were definitly funny, smart, and left affected by military life. The younger kids seemd to of adapted the best by playing imaginary games together. The oldest girl used her sense of humor and her \\"friendship\\" with her Mom to cope with it all. Kit the next oldest child was always adored by manypeople because she was pretty. She manipulated others with her charm. The one time it did not work she turned to drugs and alcohol to soothe the pain. I know it sounds silly but she honestly thought her beauty would get her ahead in any situation. The father furthered this thought by spoiling her more than the other children. He was a real piece of work. He acted a certain way around the \\"guys\\" and then he would act bored and cranky around his family for the most part. I highly recommend this book. It sure brings to light the reality of a military family.	2002-09-21

I understand from some of the customer reviews that a good book to start with would have been &quot;Tourist Season&quot;. This novel was predictable and a little slow for me. I did enjoy Mr. Hiaasen's descriptive writng when it came to characters and events. I was particularly &quot;tickled&quot; by the gal who used the Internet to make money by dressing in different costumes and &quot;talking&quot; to men. I think the banter between the protaganist and his boss was akin to the movie &quot;His Girl Friday&quot;. I do agree with other customers in that I think (even though I have not done it yet), it would be agood idea to read his other novels. I have read excerpts and beleive that his other books outshine this by a mile.	2002-08-29

What intrigued me most about this book was the &quot;politics&quot; of a small town. The rich woman Mrs. Whiting who &quot;owned&quot; most of the broke mill town. I felt for Miles  who worked at the local diner. He was sort of indebted to Mrs.Whiting for past events and he had to take care of his daughter tick. I especially enjoyed Miles's father who did nothing but drink beer and pretend to work. I was also tickled by the man that Mile's ex-wife was going to marry. He was a kind of polyester gold chain wearing throw back from the seventies. What a hoot of a character! However the part of the book that interested me the most was the comprehension that Mr. Russo has of teenage behavior. This is for the most part a difficult thing for some writers to understand. I would recommend this book based solely on that fact. I do have a couple of small criticisms. I thought that the animal violence was gratuitous. Maybe Mr. Russo was trying to make a point about certain characters behaviors but I could have done without it. Despite this, I highly recommend this book. It is wonderful.	2002-08-03

I wanted to read about every move the nanny and the family she was involved with would make next. I could not beleive the parents of poor little Grayer the four year old that Nan was &quot;babysitting&quot;. THe mother was so self-invovled I thnk she only had the child so she could have a &quot;hobby&quot; for a few years and then when he got old enough to walk and talk she could &quot;pawn&quot; him off on someone else. This woman actually thought that the few committees she was on and getting a facial or her hair done was considered a job and required the services of a nanny to watch her little boy. The father was also a real &quot;piece of work&quot;. He just cared about his work and the mistress he had on the side. I did feel so sorry for the little boy. He was so loved by his nannies and that is all he had in his life and that was not even a constant. His mother kept changing them on him. THe mother never did have a good reason for her actions. She just made up inane excuses to fire them. I certainly would enjoy a sequal to this book. I sort of felt like the ending left me hanging. It is an enjoyable book and certainly entertaining.	2002-07-09
US	52182246	R2AOQ2TLRQ6F7D	1573229326	319964836	How to Be Good	Books	5	1	4	N	Y	funny and heartbreaking insight into marriage and spituality	I was very surprised that Mr. Hornby could write a book like this from a woman's point of view. The couple in this book are in deep trouble with their marriage. The husband, David is a cynical man who seems to have complaints abpout everything. He  writes a small column in a English newspaper where he lives called &quot;The angriest man in Holloway&quot;. It even has a picture of him scowling. He writes about old people and their &quot;antics&quot; on public transportation. How they never have their money ready for a bus ride, they never use the seats set aside for them in the front, and the most hilarious, why they stand up ten minutes before their stop only to fall over in an &quot;alarming and indignified fashion&quot;. I know it is completly &quot;politically incorrect&quot; to laugh at others misfortune. I was actually enjoying the hilarity of this man taking the time to think and write about these things with such seriousness. He also gets his friends in the act with complaining about things like the decsion making process at Madame Trussaud's. Of course they think he is fall over funny and laugh and laugh. The author explains the friends are laughing with him not at him.I belevie they are unaware of how deep his anger is and how it shows itself in private with hi family, particularly with his wife. His wife, Katie, is a doctor who explains frequently that she is a good person and can't understand how she got into her marital mess. She does have an affair with a man only because he pays attention to her and gives her what she does not get from David. Positive reinforcment and tenderness. all the time she does still want her husband but she hates the fights they get into and how they seem to know excatly how to &quot;get to each other&quot;. They also have two children who are caught in the middle. They seem to do what, I remember from personal experience, is to ignore the parents and hope things will get better. Then they become more vocal about the situationand start to behave with anger and hurt. They also ask questions which in most cases are ignored or explained away by the parents. Enter &quot;DR. GOODNEWS. This guy is a piece of work. David goes to this guy, he finds in an ad, for his constant back pain.Modern doctors where unable to help him so he gave up on them. Miraculously David is healed by this DR. GOODNEWS using his hands. He then send his daughter who has cronic eczema. He also heals her. Somehow this DR. ends up moving in with the family. He actually helps David to become &quot;spiritually enlitened&quot; which not only end his anger but sends his family on an unbeleivable emotional odyssey. This book is hilarious despite the almost sickening relationship between David and Katie.I highly recomend this book to anyone who enjoys this kind of humor and insight into marriage.	2002-07-01
US	52182246	R31R14QXMXWUNA	0743422961	187539243	The Miss America Family	Books	5	2	2	N	Y	Excellent Story; fascinating dysfunctional family	I absolutly loved this book. It was even better than \\"Girl Talk\\", if that is possible. Ezra is introduced first. He is the son of a \\"want to be Miss America\\" with problems of her own and  father who eventually confesses to him that he is gay.In the beginning of the book we learn that Ezra's parents are divorced and his mother is remarried. Her husband is a poor excuse for a dentist who seems to like \\"smoozing\\" at the golf course with his cronies more than spending time with his family. Pixie the mother is full of problems. This develops into a sort of a fixation that includes participating in beauty contests when she was younger. I beleive all this is done so she can be admired by people but never touched. She does have a kind of connection with her son Ezra which is closer than most of her relationships in her life. I really felt sorry for Ezra's sister. She was kind of neglected in all of this emotional family mess. I would have liked to hear more about her. I think becuase the dentist was her father, Pixie inadvertantly ignored her. She resented her husband so much that she could not give the girl the love I think she craved. The revealed secret was hidden so well that I was even surprised by the outcome. I think what I liked most about this boof that even though it does have tis heartbreaking moments, they are infused with humor at the right moments. I think this makes Ms. Baggotts books all the more appealing.	2002-05-09

I liked this even better than \\"Girl Talk\\" I was fascinated by the characters particularly Ezra'a Mom, Pixie. She wants attention that includes admiring her beauty and other false personality traits she has learned over the years.Being close both physically  and mentally with anyone seems to sicken her. I did notice that she had some sort of \\"connection\\" with her son Ezra. That kept her grounded. The dysfuction in this family was sad but at the same time I could not help but laugh in places. The way the author describes the stepfather is hilarious. I can just picture this excuse for a dentist and how he tries to impress people by playing golf with them. I have known a lot of those types. The twist and turn this books takes are surprising and well thought out. I highly recommend this to anyone who enjoyes a good book.	2002-05-07

Peter De Vries is a brillaint comic writer. I put him up there with Woody Allen. His characters were so void of common sense yet \\"book smart\\". The situation with Tony getting his teacher pregnant in one passionate moment was the funniest thing I ever read. It never struck me as \\"dirty\\" or off color. The way the two of them handled the \\"delicate situation\\" was side splittingly funny. I have to say that when Tony starting reciting the \\"chief products of Venezuela\\" I almost fell on the floor laughing. I was also very taken by his father and the way the author described how he would read from books to his wife and Tony. The expression he would use in  his voice could almost be \\"heard\\" by me because the author described it so well. My favorite line from the book was in the beginning. Tony's teacher had assigned \\"The Scarlet letter\\". The mayor being a \\"percursor to todays Moral Majority\\" said,\\"We're gonna tighten our Bible Belt! \\"We're gonna show'em we're the buckle of the belt\\". I live in a very conservative state and it would be something I just might hear and have to giggle. I highly recommend this book. It is a winner.	2002-05-06

This author has a unique way of intertwining characters and not being obvious about how they will all affect each others lives. I usually \\"catch on\\" when this kind of writing is done in a book. Anita Shreve had me guessing until the ending which not only suprised me but filled me with emotion. I was intrigued with the marriage of Honora and Sexton. When the husband was faced with adversity his reaction caught me off guard. I also liked the character of Vivian. She was a hoot! She can only be described as a smart, sexy. eccentric you just have to love. This book got me \\"hooked\\" and I am going to read more that she has written.	2002-04-24

I think because I lived a life like that in my twenties. I really did not want to repeat the past or read about it.  However, I do think that Ms. Grosvenor is a wonderful writer. The characters were so close to home for me. I knew several men just like the character who had no time for women and only for their career. I made a fool of myself with these types. I know it sounds silly to say that I could not read abook just because of something akin to very mild Post tramatic stress syndrome. I guess I just don't want to remember and would rather read comedies and books that are more a new experience for me. Again I say though, this lady does know how to write. Kuddos!	2002-04-16

It does not matter how long ago  it was written or how much time has passed since I have read it. The characters are interesting, well-developed, and exciting. I had forgotten about how Jane Eyre's childhood was such a struggle. She experienced mental and physcial abuse at the hands of unfeeling and wicked relatives. Later in the story when she is &quot;left&quot; at a &quot;school&quot; her life is again that of a sad and angry child. Somehow through it all she manages to become a affable, caring, and trustworthy adult. This assures her not only a position has a teacher at her school but later has a governess to a child in the care of the intimidating and wealthy Mr. Rodchester. What a formadable opponent she was has an adult to Mr. Rodchesters wit and saracasim. The end of the book is full of surprises and twists. I hate to sound cliche but it is true.

It was written for the Harlequin Romance Crowd. The characters were banal. No one actually says, (and I am paraphrasing),&quot;Do you think all Royal families in the world are dysfunctional as we are&quot;? &quot;We are no different than the average commoner on the street&quot;. If I wrote a paper like this when I was in college my professor would have torn it apart. I think the story would have been interesting if not for the stale character development. There were no surprises for this reader. I think the author would be better off going to Hollywood and writing a script for a B movie.	2002-03-23

However, i did enjoy the book. I was impressed with how the main character overcame her anger, feelings of resentment and distrust for the world. I can understand why it was so difficult. The way that poor child was shuffled from relative to relative and ended up being adopted by unloving and cold people. It was a mystery to me why so many of the relatives were so unemotional and aloof. Possibly that was explained or hinted to in the book \\"Blackbird\\". Whatever it was Jennifer had the spirit and fight in her to somehow beleive that there are honest and good people in the world. I said this before in another reveiw of a book but I also think it applies here. It is obvious to me that she discovered through her life journey that it is easier to be loving than to carry around the weight of revenge and anger. I did not put this book down until I was done the story was so riveting. I have only one complaint. I was a little put off by some of the descriptions of people.   I remember this applied mostly to the men. They all had blue eyes each with their own \\"fantasy\\" type of blue. For example, one had blue eyes that were almost violet and another with gold flecks in them. I think that it a little strange. It is hard to beleive that there are that many men in the United States with these \\"rare\\" blue eyes. I have been to lots of places in the world and I have yet to run into men let alone women with this amazing feature. I do want to say that despite this, I highly recommend this book and I will be reading \\"Blackbird\\".	2002-03-11

However, the family &quot;wades&quot; through it all and in the end finds forgivness. This part of the book makes it all the more fasinating. It is unbeleivable but plausable that this family found the strength to realize that is takes more weakness and energy to hate than to love.The characters are so well-developed that I felt like I was living their lives a long with them. I consider this to be one of Oprah's surprise picks. I think her choices are mostly embarassing. This book should be rated in the catagory of Jane Eyre, Tom Sawyer and Wuthering Heights.	2002-03-03

I got more excitment when Billy Ray Tuggle and Opal were introduced years ago on &quot;All my Children&quot;. At least they could act. Fiona was a whiney woman who just made me sick instead of sorry for her. Her cousin was a poor excuse for a human being constantly crying and acting like a two-year old. I felt like I was reading a book about two woman who where psychiatric cases. That premise would have been interesting if I actually had any feeling for these characters. The only person I had any interest in was Fiona's father. He was an interesting character study. I recommend this book to anyone who wants to read something to take up time on an airplane or bus ride. I think I would have been more satisfied reading a Harliquin Romance or watching Spongebob Squarepants.	2002-02-16

The characters reminded me of the quintessential family that most of us would like to be a part of in some way. The only thing I was a bit confused about was the family all seemed to be close knit and supportive of each other no matter the circumstances. The children and mother were particularly interesting and their personalities well developed. However, when the daughter was in crisis the father complety alienated her. I did not understand the reason for his behavior. Especially when the rest of the family seemed so ready to help. I think the author needed to let us know why it was the father behaved this way. I would have liked to know more about his past. Another reviewer of this book pointed out that Corrine(the mother) picked her husband over the kids. I agree that was a big mistake. My experience as been that the children most often come first. Overall I would recommend this book to anyone who likes reading about the joys and heartaches of a small town family.	2001-02-21

What I liked most about the book was the many emotional struggles between the mother and daughter.  The  volatile relationship  between mother and daughter was not just because Amy had sex with her math teacher. It was  Isabelle's inability to be honest about her own past. I beleive even in the  best of circumstances the love/hate relationship of a mother and daughter  is always there.  In the case of Isabelle and Amy is was just more  pronounced and harder for the characters to find a common ground. I do have  to say that I think it was unnecessary to include Amy's friendship with  Paul. I had no idea where the author was going. It was especially   confusing to me why Amy and Paul had that &quot;encounter&quot; at his  apartment after their &quot;discovery.&quot; I do not think any of that was  pertinant. The author should have excluded that passage from her novel. I  highly recommend this book. I enjoyed it and I hope to read something else  of hers in the future.	2000-01-22

I was able to feel sympathy and compassion for this woman with Asperger's sydrome. Ms. Willey explained her own troubles with it and offered  solutions and coping skills. This could prove very  helpful to anyone dealing with Asperger's syndrome themselves or with a  family member. I am quite certain that this book would help alleviate their  confusion and fears about this syndrome. What I found most interesting  about this book was even though Asperger's can sometimes keep Ms. Willey  from behaving rationally either in action or talk, she never once played  the martyr.This was very refreshing. It told me she may have Asperger's but  it is clear she is a intelligent and vibrant woman. Her information seemed  concise and well researched. I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys a  book about triumph over tragedy.	1999-09-10

I was most  interested in Ella. At first she seems nervous  and unstable. However, the reader soon learns that she is just haunted by  her past and unable to live up to the expectations of her aristorcratic  family. Then she finds James and she thinks her troubles are over. These  two people start a love affair that is so profound it possesses their very  being. The depth of this love went so far that Ella made James prove his  devotion to her in a bizzare manner.This action is the catalyst to a  mystery that will keep the reader hanging on until the very end of the  book.I think Mr.Mason will go far with his novel writing if the rest of his  books are anything like this one.	1999-07-20

My  favorite character was Chablis. That person was a hoot. She was outragous  with just hint of sadness in her personality. I recommend this book to  anyone who likes mysteries mixed with a little &quot;southern flavor&quot;.	1999-06-09

I could not put this book down.The story of Anne Sullivans horrendous childhood was complety unkown to me until I read this book. The relationship between Helen and Anne Sullivan  was not the one I read in  other books and saw in the movies either.  I had no idea that  &quot;teacher&quot; became so controlling over Helen. Anne did not want  Helen to marry and have a family and live a &quot;normal&quot; life. She  wanted the public to see Helen only has a saint.  The ultimate savior of  the blind and deaf. Anne thought the only way this could be accomplished  was to be Helen's only guide and inspiration. A relationship that turned a  &quot;wild child&quot; into a human then into a kind of gratefull prisoner.  The writer did a great job of portraying the truth! '	1998-12-01
