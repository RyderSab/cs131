But Batman is suspicous.  Why are these new meta-humans appearing?  And was their a villian for each new hero?<br />Good action-adventure for those of us who grew up reading these characters.<br />Maybe it's just my Silver Age sensabilities, but this book loses a star for a couple of mild profanities (the &quot;d-word&quot;) that I felt were out of genera.	2004-07-19

Very slim book for the price.  Writing style is equally sparse.  Lots of facts and quotes from historical sources, almost no context tying them together.  Almost like geting a book on dinosaurs, and finding it consist only of an assemble-it-yourself Tyranosaurus skeleton, with no instructions.  This reads like the author's research notes, waiting to be fleshed out.  Facinating subject, excelient research, poor execution.	2003-08-09

Interesting speculation, given that the treatment of women in the book is one of the major criticisms.)<br />The central question in the book is about identity, are we our bodies, our brains, or Something Else, possibly our souls?  This is never really resolved, we don't find out for sure if Eunice has survived her murder or if Johan is just delusional.  <br />Coupled with this is the question of sexual identity.  When this was written having bisexual characters was very controversial, cutting edge stuff.  Now it's badly dated, and the Kinesian hypothesis that everyone is bisexual to some extent or another has largely been disproven by subsequent research.  Still it's an interesting question.  If someone you loved suddenly became a person of the opposite sex, how would that change your feelings about them?<br />It's not essential Heinlein or essential Science Fiction.  It is a good thought piece.  Read Heinlein's other books first, then let this one challenge your preconceptions.	2001-12-29

Bawer draws a distinction between gays, those who in his mind act steriotypically, and homosexuals like himself, Republican, Christian, conservatives that he claims (on no evidence whatsoever) outnumber gays.  Given that distinction, this is an anti-gay, but not anti-homosexual, book.<br />But in distancing himself from the steriotype of the gay man, he has fallen victim to another steriotype, the humorless puritan Christian, contemptious of everone.  EVERYONE.  Bawer spewes venom Right and Left, at Republicans, Christians, gays, and closeted homosexuals who have all failed to live up to his standards.<br />Just a few brief comments on the Gay Pride Parade, it's fun, some self-parody and camp.  Personally, I would prefer that the NAMBLA members (all three of them) not be there, but it seems hypocritical to exclude them while we complain about being excluded from other parades.  <br />Keep reading though.  The final chapter of this should be read by everyone, gay or straight.  It is an autobiographical essay on his self-discovery, coming out, and what he felt was a calculated insult from a heterosexual friend (and he is probably right about that).   It is sensitive and moving, and that is why this book gets four stars.<br />Also don't miss Stealing Jesus; how fundamentalism betrays Christianity.  A much more mature work (5 years later) by the same author.	2001-11-30

It's good as far as it goes, but every chapter could use further elaboration.<br />Footnotes are at the back of the book.  With modern word processors, it is not that difficult to put footnotes where they belong.  But then it would be more obvious that this book relies on few original sources, but second and third hand accounts and hearsay, and books such as Holy Blood, Holy Grail, which are cryptohistory at best.<br />Ms. Ellerby makes some interesting points, and I think that most, if not all, of them can be supported by original sources, which would make this a more authorative work.	2001-11-25

A stopped clock is persistent, it's even right twice a day, but is it true?<br />This book is the scientific equlivent of a stopped clock, except that I do not recall it being right a single time, much less twice a day.

He shows, for example, how a rogue comet could have caused the Ten Plagues of Exodus.  However, he fails to present any evidence that such a thing as the Plagues ever happened. (Wouldn't the Egyptians have noticed them?  Written about them?  Why then is there no Egyptian account of them?)  But by application of the GIGO (Garbage In, Garbage Out) principle, he also ends up with mythology (and supporters who defend his work, against all evidence, with a zeal that can only be described as religious).  Myth and Legend may be a place to START an inquiry, but in and of themselves they prove nothing.<br />If you want an overview of Velikovsky's theories, and why they are wrong, read Broca's Brain by Carl Sagan.	2001-11-19

Hugo Award, Best Novel 2001<br />WARNING: This is the fourth book of the series, read them in order for maximum enjoyment and understanding.<br />The Harry Potter series, for those of you who have been living in a cave in Afganistan the past few years, postulates a society of wizards and magical creatures, living alongside but hidden from the ordinary non-magical people, or &quot;muggles.&quot;  Harry is the child of two wizards.  At a young age Harry's parents were killed by You Know Who, but miraculously Harry survived the Death Curse cast upon him by the evil wizard, and the spell killed the caster.  Harry spent his childhood with his mother's muggle relations, and knew nothing about magic until he was old enough to go to boarding school.<br />My boy complains that this is a gender-switched retelling of The Worst Witch; just as The Lion King is Hamlet in cat costumes.  There are only seven stories, the art is in the telling.  And J. K. Rowling tells this story well.<br />As I write this there are almost four thousand reviews of this book, over three thousand of them with a five star rating.  Let me just add that while the media insist on calling these children's books, adults can enjoy them too.<br />I cannot stress strongly enough read the books in order!  This book makes a turning point in the tone of the series.  This book may be too violent for some pre-teens (individual parents should judge), it is not more than a PG-13.	2001-11-13

I have Grimm and Anderson in hardback, love the Oz books, memorized page after page of Lewis Caroll as a child, and have read Tolkien far, far too many times.  My Inner Child is well read.<br />However, this is a series that has never held my interest.  As a child I read Lion, Witch and Wardrobe; was underwhelmed, and did not read the rest until I was grown.  People obviously have strong feelings about these stories, almost four hundred reviews as a write this, over 350 with five stars.  I reread the whole book, and I still don't get it.<br />All children's literature contains an element of socialization, instructing the reader on what is proper and improper behavior.  Lewis lays this on thick, with all the subtlety of a medieval Morality Play.  If Lewis were not known for writing Christian Apologetics the moral relativism in these stories would bring them under as much attack as Harry Potter (heroic characters lie and steal).  Character development is non-existent, and they aren't even well written (voice varies, without apparent pattern, from Third Person Observer to Third Person Limited Omniscience with odd and distracting First Person interjections).<br />Nonetheless, I was happy to find the whole series in a single volume, and it has been placed on the bookshelf in my guest room.  Maybe someone will enjoy it more than I do.	2001-11-12

I'm hoping that Clarke will be remembered as the man who invented the 21st.  As I type this there is a TV in the room, connected to a box, in turn connected to a dish on the roof, that is pointed to a satellite over 42,000 km away in what is called a Clarke Orbit, after the astronomer who realized it would be a useful place for a communications satellite to be, Sir Arthur C. Clarke. <br />So what does that have to do with this novel?  In this book Clarke talks about a bridge, a tether that connects the ground to Clarke orbit.  A vertical railroad, allowing for a more economical method for reaching Earth-orbit than riding on a Space Shuttle with the power of sixty-five locomotives.<br />As in real life, the political problems far outweigh the technical ones, and those who say that Clarke is weak in characterization have not read the same book I did.<br />Do the math, we can build a tether, we should build it.  The only thing wrong with this book is that it hasn't happened, yet.	2001-11-10

For example, I never heard of a septic tank having a siphon discharge system.  But this book touches on it briefly, in one diagram and a sidebar, and goes on.  I will have to research to see what are the disadvantages of a siphon discharge system and why they are not more widely used.  <br />This seems to happen over and over again, this is more an outline or a checklist for further research than a comprehensive how-to book on getting back to the land.  It is easy and enjoyable to read, the tone is light and conversational, the two authors have dinstince editorial voices, the layout is more magazine-like than a book (you decide if that's a plus or a minus).  The postwar lingo and drawings, and the Leave It To Beaver assumptions of what family life should be, have not aged well.  <br />This is a facinating period piece, but if you are really contemplating a rural lifestyle (and for some reason I am) Five Acres and Independence gives you a lot more information at a better price.  The Have-More Plan covers the subject broadly but not deeply, and I feel that I've paid ($)for a comic book or an outline of talking points to convince The Little Woman that this is a good idea.<br />(For the record, there is no Little Woman in my life.)	2001-11-08

My first exposure to this counter-culture classic was in the most unexpected of settings, my college ROTC classroom. The book written in protest of the Viet-Nam War was being used by a Green Beret veterain of that same war to train us who might be leading troops in, yes, that same war. The irony speaks for itself. I understand that William Powell no longer agrees with what he wrote as a young man, and symphathise with the plight of an artist who has lost control of his work. However, I am glad (and somewhat suprised) that this is still available. Not only is it an important sociological piece of the period, but it is filled with information that could be useful if (god forbid) things ever hit the fan. That same ROTC instructor told me time and again, &quot;Better to have it and not need it than need it and not have it,&quot; so this book gets a space on my shelf just in case.

Heinlein (and yes, it takes at least three people to fill Heinlein's shoes).  I was very glad to see that his first novel, In the Country of the Blind, was going to be back in print (will his short story collection, Werehouse, be following I hope I hope I hope).<br />This novel never got the respect it deserved when first published.  It fell &quot;between the cracks&quot; of science fiction and a mainstream thriller.  The Babbage Society believes they can mathmatically model the future.  If they are correct, the book is Science Fiction.  If they are delusional, but still willing to kill to protect their worthless secret, it's a contemporary mainstream thiller.  Either way makes no difference to the plot, well-developed characters hold and express both opinions, and the book rides a quantum function without resolving itself into one or the other.<br />So why didn't it become a crossover hit, popular with fans of both generas?  I don't know.  Possibly too speculative for the mainstream, not speculative enough for hard SF fans?<br />Both groups have cheated themselves out of a fantastic read.  If you like near-future (now near-past) science fiction OR contemporary techno-thrillers, buy this book, read this book, pass this book along to fans.<br />Personal note, other reviewers have remarked, unfavorably, on the dust jacket pictures of some of Mr. Flynn's other books.  This one continues the unfortunate trend.  The central character is a Black woman.  On the cover of the paperback we had the metaphorical one-eyed man, now we have a White woman in a cyber-helmet breaking chains.  Would it be so wrong to put a Black woman on the cover?  Would it be so dificult to have a dust jacket that wasn't mud fence ugly?  DEFINITELY do not judge this book by its cover.	2001-08-24

So when I started this, I was not in the most receptive of moods.  By the second chapter, I was totally hooked.<br />This is a psychological novel, more so than the average Trek fare.  This is Julian's book.  He must do a favor for the people he hates most in the Universe, Section 31, and also confront the road not taken.<br />He must contend with the dragon, a fellow Genetically Enhanced doctor who has confirmed the worst predictions of the Federation by taking Khan as his role model.  The dragon is Julian-as-he-might-have-been, Julian finds it all too easy to get inside his opponents head, but far more difficult to get back out.	2001-08-23
US	52533003	R2LQWMSXSC7BXB	0380979012	84144543	The Curse of Chalion	Books	4	8	9	N	N	Just read it, you'll thank me later	Robert A. Heinlein is my favorite author.  Lois McMaster Bujold is my favorite living author. Spider Robinson and Michael Flynn, both fine authors in their own right, have frequently been called Heinlein's successor.  But do the math.  Heinlein won four \\"Best Novel\\" Hugo awards. Bujold is right behind him with three, more than any other living person.  She will tie him, and if the fates grant her long life surpass him.<br />But sadly, not with this novel.<br />Which is not to say it isn't good.  Minor Bujold, like minor Heinlein, is still better than 90% of what's available.  But I am so just so throughly spoiled by the Vorkosigan family saga.  (Since the name has come up, I don't understand the reviewers who compare Cazaril with Miles.  Miles wants honor and glory, Cazaril only wants to be left in peace.)<br />Other reviewers have covered the plot.  I will only say that it is a nice touch that the title curse affects its victims not by exaggerating their vices, but by mis-aiming their virtues (the process by which Ms. Bujold creates her finest villains).  The world-building is interesting, the theology well thought out, but you don't get the same feeling that the world continues beyond the edges of the book that you do in her other works.<br />Two minor quibbles.  The titles were confusing,   Royina, Roya, Royesse, and Royse become apparent through context, but does a Castillar outrank a March or vice versa?  A glossary would have been useful.  The other was that the denouement seemed to drag a bit, taking two chapters as she hunted every loose end, wrestled it to the ground, and drove a stake through its heart.  Strangely so as she is already contracted to write another book in this reality. <br />But all I do is complain.  This is a fantastic book.  If you know Ms. Bujold's work, you already know you want to read this one.  If you have not been introduced to her yet, read this one, The Spirit Ring, and Falling Free.  She'll be your favorite living author too, even before you get to her Hugo and Nebula winners.	2001-08-16

Since the days of the APA That Dare Not Speak Its Name (long story short, we've corresponded, never met). I picked up this book because of his name on the cover. I like Andy, and I was predisposed to like his book. And I do.<br />One thing did bother me about the book that no other review has mentioned. The action takes place on Chiaros IV, a world that barely qualifies for Federation membership and is being courted by the Federation and the Romulans. The planet is tide-locked, one side perpetually facing its sun. The habitable zone is a narrow band at the terminator, the weather is always bad, and off-planet communications are through a tethered communications relay . . . huh? An orbital tether has to be anchored at geosyncronous orbit. Geosyncronous orbit for a tide-locked planet is the same as the distance to its sun. The Chiarosans' communications relay is on a tether 150 million kilometers long, a very impressive bit of engineering for a civilization that has not fully explored their own solar system. But it doesn't matter to the plot, and no one reads Star Trek books for the physics.<br />Characterization is excellent, all the Next Generation characters are consistent. Andy has done his homework, there is enough continuity and trivia to delight the most hard-core Trekie. Action sequences are well-paced and exciting. Don't know how it fits into the series, but it was good as a stand-alone novel.<br />It's difficult to take Section 31 seriously from this, the two operatives we see here seem incredibly naive in believing the Tal Shiar would hand over a list of their Resources in the Federation for anything, much less a marginal planet. These clowns seem to have more in common with the Watergate Plumbers than the Obsidian Order. If this is the caliber of agent Section 31 recruits, it is difficult to see how it has stayed a secret for two hundred years. <br />On a personal note, I tend to think of ScienceFiction fans as more inteligent and more open minded than the average person, so I was somewhat disturbed by the reviewers who made a Big Deal out of the fact that Lt. Sean Hawk is Gay. Trekers follow stories of seeking out new life and new civilizations, it's disappointing that some of them find it easier to accept aliens than humans who are different.	2001-07-12

It all comes together beautifully, scientific explanations simple enough to be understood by the layman but thorough enough to insure understanding. It is also a fascinating look at genetic research at the end of the 20th century, and how technical problem are sometimes easier to solve than political ones.<BR>Buy it, read it, loan it to family and friends. Give it to anyone who still thinks that sexuality is a choice. The only thing wrong is that it's gone out of print, but I hope that's because the author is preparing a second edition.	2001-07-04
US	52533003	R3BO221K79TL11	0970073380	263128419	Astrobiology, the Origin of Life, and the Death of Darwinism (2nd Edition)	Books	1	12	15	N	N	...	Panspermia, the hypothesis that life did not originate on Earth but Elsewhere, needs to be given serious consideration by the scientific establishment.  This book is a huge step in the wrong direction.<br />In the introduction Joseph throws out evolution.  In the first chapter he throws out the Big Bang, General Relativity, and the Second Law of Thermodynamics.  Yes, at least some of our current ideas are probably wrong, but you need something more to throw out the Second Law of Thermodynamics than that it conflicts with your pet Steady State hypothesis.<br />On top of that, this reads like a rough draft, with punctuation errors and mis-numbered diagrams that a halfway competent editor would have caught on the first read through.<br />DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!	2001-06-14
US	52533003	R2ZO9EH7DYL7SY	0425166317	634116834	Generation X: Crossroads	Books	5	2	2	N	N	ROAD TRIP!!!	Somehow, seeing the Generation X kids acting, well, like kids makes them even more endearing.  Adult mentors Banshee and the White Queen boldly go where no X-chaperone has gone before, hearding teenagers on a cross country journey of discovery.<br />Just being ouside the bounds of the normal super-hero genra allows the characters to streach out.  This book also brings back M.O.N.S.T.E.R., for those of us old enough to remember the six-fingered hand, and introduces three M.O.N.S.T.E.R. members, Chill, Recall, and Dog Pound.  (I can't wait until Dog Pound meets up with Danile Moonstar, they're both telepathic with animals, so are they telepathic with each other?)<br />For me, the high point of the book was the sonic attack that even Banshee's ears could not endure, but there is enough characterization, action, and humor here for every X-Fan.	2001-05-22

The Hero System is an excelent role playing system.  It allowed one to simulate the comic book genra, among other things it was the first system (as far as I know of) that allowed non-fatal damage, making it possible to knock out a character without killing them.<br />Challenges for Champions is ten unconnected miminalist scenarios for the Champions Super Hero role playing system.  These are good to fill in if a prepared scenario finishes more quickly than anticipated, or scenarios in a running campagine, or as a jump start for the GameMaster's imagination.	2001-05-21
