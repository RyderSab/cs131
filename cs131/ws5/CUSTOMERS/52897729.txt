She was impressive then, and, after reading this book,  I'm even more impressed by her career and her accomplishments, which were underrepresented in the 'computing history' to which I had previously been exposed.  Through interviews and delving into untold amount of original source material, Ms. Williams has found MANY fascinating tidbits about Grace and the environment in which she lived and worked. For example, Grace DIDN'T invent the term computer bug.  However, the interesting facts are strung together in an oft times confusing narrative - it took me much longer to read than usual. And the index didn't mention her engaging physical representation of a nanosecond.  A worthwhile book, nonetheless, for those interested in computing history, and/or women who made a difference in technology.	2005-01-24

Other reviewers have ably described the plot. Although the Publisher's Weekly editorial says the story is 'based on psychology that defies reason', I suggest that JAK has pushed the bounds of believability no more than any good writer.  In fact, on page 215, JAK lists several dream research authors - all of whom can be found on Amazon! If you enjoy JAK, or Jayne Castle, there's no reason not to add this to your library.	2004-12-01

Too many of the other authors that other reviewers have mentioned are touting their own thoughts, not necessarily research based. I liked his distinctions between the various domains of positive emotions (past, present, and future), and how they need to be looked at differently. I didn't care for his agnostic/atheist stance, but I found it easy to ignore.  At times I found his habit of alternating between scholary writing and 'dear diary' style irritating; at other times interesting. I certainly would follow his recommendation to take the various tests online, vs on paper.  I've found the online email newsletter to be of interest.	2004-11-09

Pride was filled with stories of various interest highlighting why money isn't always the compelling motivator.  While I could relate to many of the examples, I was annoyed with his declarative conclusions based on those anecdotes.  Seligman's book, on the other hand, was replete with descriptions of studies relating to the value (and power) of positive emotions (aka happiness).  Applying what I learned from Seligman, I found Katzenbach more credible.  (And Katzenbach will probably sound more credible in the business environment.)	2004-11-09

In this absurd romance, we not only have the handsome hero and beautiful heroine, but her randy, blackmailing grandmother, dotty mother, stupid brother, a con artist, a murderous seamstress, a buxom maid, assorted lords and ladies as well as the downstairs staff, and, of course, the very correct butler who, albeit unwittingly, set the whole amusing chain of events in motion.  There are several story lines in addition to the main event.  I laughed out loud several times, and could hardly put the book down.  The only reason this isn't a 5 is because there isn't much emotional depth - even the hero's angst over almost killing his best friend is handled lightly.	2004-09-06

However, since JAK has never let me down, I went ahead.  Yes, the 2 stories are not her best, but I still found them engaging- I read the whole book in basically one sitting.  They were not quite a humorous as some of her others, but they moved at a brisk pace. I found Dangerous Magic facinating as it seemed to foretell JAK's own other word stories, as well as bits and pieces of some of her other contemporary.  Although Wade was unbelievably overbearing, he had a reason; and Elissa was certainly not your average, everyday woman.  Affair of Honor seemed to be pretty typical - Ryder had a bit of haunting past, and Brenna certainly was dealing with her own issues.  JAK's familiarity with academic environment was evident in this story.  Personally, I loved the not too obvious psychological insights, the frank way the guys went after what they wanted, and how the women held their own.	2004-04-04

While certainly not as dark of some of her more recent books, I was somewhat disappointed.  In the forward, Anne indicates this story is an experiment for her.  I was attracted to the romance of a heroine grieving for 10 years for her lost love, especially after she had only known the hero a few days (love at first sight and all), but I was put off by how dismal she was for that long period of time.  And, after Danny/Mac's memory returned, I was surprised he didn't remember his passion for her.  The mystery was a bit contrived as well.	2004-02-07

The first book (Fire Hawk) explains the origins of the book that is destined to appear to the last remaining Hawk.  Heart of the Hawk is set after the Civil War; Wild Hawk is contemporary.  In Heart of the Hawk, The Hawk, notorious gunfighter kills a man, and is about to hang, when he is released, due to new evidence that the man's widow helped find.  The Hawk's attempts to rid himself of the mysterious book that can't be destroyed or left behind are quite endearing.  Both Joshua and Kate have tragic pasts to overcome, and I could feel their anguish. There are interesting secondary characters.  And some mystery (why DOES Kate feel so guity about Joshua?)  Although I did see the general outlines of the ending well ahead of time, there were twists I didn't expect.  All in all, this was a book I could barely put down.	2004-02-01

I read them in sequence, so the part about the book was a little repetitious.  However, Jason's reaction to the book is everything you'd expect from an intelligent modern man, with no use for magic. A man who doesn't believe in love, and a woman who can love the unlovable, a malicious widow, murder, mystery and magic, what more could one ask for?	2004-01-31

Six months later the story picks up with Delia's return to London after a self imposed exile.  Like the one reviewer, I kept expecting Delia's dead husband to reappear.  Unlike that reviewer, however, I didn't feel the book dragged at all. The emotional entanglements were novel,  and handled quite intelligently. Delia, while at times rather childish, was nonetheless rather endearing.  St. Stephens also generally rang true.  I enjoyed the twists and turns, not the least of which were accomplished by learning what had happened in her first marriage via bits and pieces in flashback. The ending left some interesting threads hanging.	2004-01-25

I was captivated by the first few pages that were posted on Amazon.  Unfortunately, I didn't read the reviews.  I concur with those that found Ashlynne immature and petty, and Falkon a bit stupid. (I think the book summaries should say how old the main characters are - at my age, reading about teenagers in love has little appeal.)  The plot was unsophisticated, and the happy ending unbelievably contrived.  And the otherworldliness was just a veneer - authors like Jayne Castle do it much better.  After the first few chapters I just skimmed the pages to see if there was anything original.	2004-01-18

The first was such a disappointment, I almost didn't read this book, but I had purchased them at the same time.  Sunlight seemed heavily borrowed from Starman (movie and TV series), thus lacking much in the way of originality.  Lainey didn't impress me, and, while I did rather like Michah, I couldn't get engaged in the plot (which included a rather bizarre evil scientist, and characters that didn't really 'fit'.) I ended up skipping to the end without feeling I missed much in the middle. Moonlight, on the the other, started off quite well - the birthing of the vampire was novel to me.  2000 years later, however, the contemporary story was rather pedestrian, mared by Andrianne naivete, and Navarre's goodness. (None of the torment of Buffy's Angel, for example)  I did, however manage  to read this through.	2004-01-18

I enjoyed the many story lines, woven together.  I liked getting to know the 'old' characters better, and watched them wrestle with different angst than the typical romance. (The chapter with Singleton talking with Jeff about his murdered father was particularly poignant.) I laughed aloud several times.  All in all, a thoroughly enjoyable way to spend a few hours.	2004-01-10

From the beginning, I found the writing almost reporter-like, lacking empathy.  The purported emotions didn't seem to ring true, although there was enough situational drama that it ought to have rung the heartstrings.  Instead it was quite flat.  Several times the story line went into past tense, which was less engaging, and sometimes put-offing.  It almost seemed that Ms. Thornton couldn't figure out how to describe the scene real time.  Adam had the kind of scarred past that I usually find appealing, and Claire was in theory a strong woman (who seemed to go to pieces rather frequently).  Lots of secondary characters, many of whom didn't really add to the basic story line. I skimmed a good chuck of the book, just to see if it got more interesting. Which it didn't.	2003-07-06

I have always enjoyed her quirky characters (neither super beautiful nor super rich).  The dialog and interactions are realistic without being mundane.  The twists and turns in the mysteries kept me engaged without going over the top.

The overall story line (poor girl forced into poverty, then 'prostitution'; man seeking to avenge the death of the women he loved) had significant possibilities, but the execution was flat.

This book is a fun set of '2nd Epilogues' for each of the original books, for those who've read them.  Quinn provides a couple of pages of context - enough for those who've read the books to recall key elements, but probably not enough for those who haven't.

The supposedly smart and dangerous gentleman, can makes lots of money, but can't solve the mystery of his own birth. The characters simply were not consistent and therefore not very engaging.  I kept reading because I curious about the mysteries Ms. London was at such great pains to suggest.

Weiland has spent 16  hellish years in Daria's remote castle with few companions (all of whom were formerly wolves, racoons, mice, birds or other animals.)

Weiland, and other member of Daria's  household (mice as lady's in waiting etc) all learn about the real world.  Weiland also sees an even darker side to Daria, which his growing conscience will not allow him to ignore, even though stopping Daria means becoming a wolf for the rest of his life.
