I picked this up in Bangkok this weekend simply because it's being reviewed in the Thai presses right now. Also, I'm always interested in reading books based in Thailand that AREN'T about the sex trade, prostitutes and the fat farang who has a bar girl girlfriend.    Lapcharoensap is interesting in that, for all intents and purposes, he was brought up in the US, so he's writing more as a Westerner looking at Thailand than he is as a Thai.  His dialogue, for instance, is not written the way Thais actually speak but instead sounds more like Americans speaking.  That for me was the weak point of the stories.  Having said that though, his prose is nice, and I think he's very talented.  I look forward to reading more of his work, especially his upcoming novel.    I'm giving the book 4 stars though for really no other reason than that it's written by a Thai writer, and there aren't very many of them writing in English.	2005-09-14

A bit of a disappointment.  Through the first 100 pages or so, I really held high hopes for this series, but my patience fizzled fast.  The author spends a lot of time weaving images which have very little story, characters that are confusing and dull, and the story is so winding, and rambling that I lost interest long ago about who these people are and what they're doing. <br /> <br />Erikson seems to be someone who likes to use intellectual, supposedly 'smart' ideas, but lacks the ability of translating those ideas into a form that your average reader can understand.   <br /> <br />George R. R. Martin also writes huge tomes, but whereas he is a true 'storyteller', Erikson falls flat.   <br /> <br />I have bought the next two in the series already so will give the second book in the series a chance.  If the ideas aren't presented in a muddle, like the first book, it will be worth reading but if it's still the same writing style, I will probably give up after the first few pages and hand them on to Goodwill.	2005-09-06

Billed as an \\"American Harry Potter\\", it's so far from the truth it's laughable. <br /> <br />Where Harry Potter has pure magic, incredible fantasy, and knows how it feels to be a kid, The Magickers' plot is trite, slow-paced and plain dull, with a definite '60s' feel to it - as if the author doesn't have a clue about kids today.  The characters are dull, the dialogue is so ridiculous it's laughable, and the plot goes nowhere.  I can't believe I waded through to the end of it, hoping it would get better. <br /> <br />Does anyone want a free copy of the second book in the series?  There's no way I'm going to waste any more time on reading this author's books.	2005-08-14

I just finished reading Bloody Bones and immediately bought the next two in the series. <br /> <br />While Anita Blake's insistence on not having sex until she gets married is annoying, as it's so unbelievable when taking into consideration the rest of her character, the character overall and the book are phenomenal. <br /> <br />Well-written, quirky and weird - with a world of vampires, werewolves, shapeshifters all spoken of so matter-of-factly that it's beautifully believable.  This isn't usually my type of fare, as I like the 'real' fantasy/vampire/horror stuff not the type that are written like pseudo-30s detective novels, but this series is well worth the effort. <br /> <br />Anita got a little bitchier in Bloody Bones, which became a tad annoying, but her relationship with Jean-Claude developed even more, which made up for Anita's bitchiness. <br /> <br />Can't wait to see what happens in book 6!	2005-08-14

The book is plain dull and annoying. <br /> <br />Mayes desperately tries to make herself sound educated and cultured by quoting Horace and Plato in situations that don't really seem to warrant such a quote.  Her descriptions of the luscious Italian countryside are dry and unimaginative, and what she talks about is simply uninteresting. <br /> <br />Italy is an amazing country, but this book doesn't do it justice at all.	2005-07-16

The reviewers on the back of Moore's first book in this series talk about him being the next Stephen King.  Not even close.  His idea is a bit 'done before', but that's not really the main problem.  Where King creates well-rounded characters, Moore simply gives you a cardboard cutout of the person and then kills them off two chapters later.  There's so many characters, it's hard to figure out who is who BECAUSE they aren't well-developed.  And because the story is all for shock value ie: many people killed, but we're not really quite sure why (except for the husband of the woman killed as a witch), you quickly lose interest. <br /> <br />I bought the first and the second ones in the series together, but wouldn't buy any further books.  Stephen King makes people think that writing these kind of books easy.  Stephen King, however, is a master storyteller, which definitely shows up when you see the difference between any of his books and something like this.   <br /> <br />	2005-07-09

A shallow copy of much of Stephen King's work, but without King's story writing skills.  Cardboard characters, with little to hold my attention.  And a feeling of the author wanting to go into the gruesome elements of some of these killings, but just not quite being able to force himself to 'go there'.   <br /> <br />I'm not a huge Stephen King fan, but I do at least appreciate his amazing storytelling abilities, which are sadly lacking by Moore.	2005-07-09

Wonderful book, written with a dry sense of humour that at first makes you laugh.  But, as you read on further into the book, you realize how scary the information is and how sad. <br /> <br />This should be a MUST read for all Americans.  Having lived in America for over 20 years, I have always found the majority of Americans to be very naive when it comes to their government, believing that the American government only has the best interests of themselves and others at heart.  And if you believe that, I have a bridge I can sell you! <br /> <br />Read especially the information about Guantanamo Bay and Iraq.  Very frightening stuff.	2005-06-11

I read I Know This Much Is True abour 5 years ago.  Back then, it stuck in my mind as one of the best things I'd read in years.  So I bought it again recently, wondering if it would hold up for a second read.  It did.  Lamb's writing is beautiful.  Dominick is one of the most complex characters you will ever read in American fiction.  He's dark, depressed and closed off from his emotions and from other people.  At the same time, he's struggling to try to find his way 'out of the woods' so he doesn't get 'lost in the woods' like his twin brother, who is in a mental institution after cutting off his hand as a protest against the first 'Iraq War'.  Dominick is also a good person who tries to do the right thing, even though the decisions he makes are often without much thought and thus he harms himself and those who care for him.  He doesn't mean them to be that way. <br /> <br />This is one of those rare books that makes you cry.  After his brother's funeral, when he is screaming at his step-father Ray for the way Ray brought up the two boys, even though I felt so sorry for Dominick, I also was heartbroken for Ray who had stumbled into fatherhood and, coming from a terrible homelife himself, had done the best he knew how. The book is written so gorgeously that, at the same time as you despise some of the characters, you are also rooting for them because you can see their mistakes are oh so human. <br /> <br />Brilliant, brilliant book.  Now I want to know when is Lamb's next fiction book coming out??????????????	2005-05-07

I was already tiring of this fantasy trilogy by the end of book two.  Book two could have been pruned by at least 200 pages, and the entire 'trilogy' actually has a plot that's so slim it could have been edited into just one book of around 700 pages.  But noooooo, both Hobb's and her publisher stretched as much out of it as possible, obviously so they could make more money. <br /> <br />I read Hobbs' 'Liveship' Trilogy and loved it.  The story was smart, fast-paced and involved, and set in a world that was full of detail but not overly explained.  It was also full of interesting characters. In Assassin's Quest, the 'hero' (if that's what you MUST call him, because he's the biggest idiot ever to appear in fiction) is so incredibly dull and stupid that I just want to do King Regal's job and kill him myself. <br /> <br />A huge disappointment.  I think this will be the last book I read of Hobb's, as her ability to write believable and compelling fiction seems to be waning.	2005-05-07
US	51281884	R3CTT8E6O7HI93	0520204956	618151081	Geisha	Books	1	9	62	N	N	As Dull as Ditchwater	This is one of the worst books I've ever read.  The premise sounded interesting - \\"only American woman ever to become a geisha\\" - so I thought it would be worth picking up to learn more about the world of the geisha.  Boy, was I wrong! <br /> <br />The big problem is that Dalby is a terrible writer.  Her prose is all over the map, but doesn't say anything.  The book is full of little anecdotes that are really pretty dull, and she is so incredibly full of herself and her supposed intellect that she puffs herself up whenever she can.  One example being she tells the story of how when one geisha died in a fire, the geisha's family received a telegram from President Ford. Then later on, she just HAS to tell the reader that the reason the President sent the telegram was because SHE (Dalby) had written to him and asked him to. <br /> <br />The book is uninteresting (which was surprising to me as the world of the geisha is such a fascinating and unique subject that I would have thought it should be relatively easy to write a book with some substance.  This book has no substance whatsoever).  It's also written by someone who seems to either have a complete lack of any self-confidence, so she feels the need to be constantly reminding the reader of how intelligent and wonderful she is, OR she has so much self-confidence that she feels herself to be so much better than most of the rest of us.  The problem is, I didn't care either way.  She's not someone who interests me in the slightest, therefore I found very little of interest in her trite, fluffy book. <br /> <br />Dreadfully disappointing.	2005-04-24

This was the first Ben Elton book I read (have since read 3 more as I enjoyed this one so much).  The book is so fabulously well written, especially about a subject that many men might find difficult to write about (the inability to conceive), but Elton manages to make the reader empathize with the protagonist even at the same time that you think he's acting like a complete twerp! I sympathized with both him and his spouse, and could understand why he acted the way he did even though I was wanting to shout to him \\"Oh Geez, don't do THAT.\\" :-) <br /> <br />I couldn't put the book down - read it in one 3 1/2 hour sitting and then immediately went out and bought another Elton book. Fabulous book.  Talented author.	2005-04-22

Sure, her husband died so, at the beginning, I started to read with sympathy.  But when she not only had a complete breakdown but then continued to be wimpy, inenpt, letting everyone trample all over her, without putting up much of a fight I got bored. <br /> <br />I would have enjoyed the book more if I felt that she had eventually gotten some 'cojones' and taken more control of her life instead of just drifting along, letting everyone else dictate it for her. <br /> <br />I would probably read more of Ms. Winston's books as she is an excellent writer, but would be more careful about reading through more of the book before buying it simply because I would be wary about yet another wimpy character.	2005-04-21

A friend turned me on to Dean Koontz recently and I've since read 5 of his books, the last one being Odd Thomas.  He's a great writer, writing some wonderfully descriptive passages and some marvellously funny dialogue.  My only complaint is that his descriptive passages tend to be a bit long, often saying the same thing but in a different way. <br /> <br />Overall though, I thoroughly enjoyed Odd Thomas.  A fabulous lead character, and some interesting supporting characters with a good, gripping story made it a great read!  I recommend it. <br /> <br />Also love that he always has a dog in his books, and that he obviously loves dogs so much.	2005-04-21

I've already seen Fahrenheit 9/11 and was thrilled to see the book was out, as well as happy to see a transcription of the movie included in it.  The book is a good read - informative, well-written and with Michael Moore's usual honesty touched with irony and humour. There are so many well-researched facts in Moore's movie that I want to remember, it's handy to have them in book form.   <br /> <br />Michael Moore is one of the greatest Americans.  He does not allow someone who stole the Presidency to get away with what the American people have let him get away with for 4 years.  Good for him!	2004-11-02

I'm just finishing reading The Prince of Dreams, the second in the Seven Brothers trilogy.  I bought books one and two not knowing how good of a writer Benjamin was, and unfortunately I have been very disappointed on that score.<br />The author has obviously researched ancient Chinese history extensively and has crafted an interesting, vivid story.  The problem is his writing abilities do not live up to the story he is telling.  Often I am reading and find myself asking &quot;WHO is he talking about?&quot;  &quot;That statement makes NO sense&quot;, &quot;WHY is he telling something that he's already told us twice before?&quot; etc.  His writing is stilted, forced and confusing in many places in the book.<br />A pity.  With more honed writing skills, this book could have been a huge winner.  As it stands now, unfortunately I doubt I'll buy the third in the series.	2004-04-30

One of the funniest books I've read in years	This book is perfect, literally perfect.<br />It's funny, it's smart, it's touching, it's sad, it's heartwrenching, and beautiful.  And it has some of the best one liners of anything I've ever read.  Kevin, the protagonist, is a 17 year old boy/man who just happens to be gay.  And that's one of the things I love about how Malloy tells Kevin's story.  I've read enough so-called 'gay fiction' where the fact that the character is gay overshadows the book and the story itself becomes incidental to the characters gayness.  Malloy's book is about family and life and growing up, with the fact that Kevin is gay as simply a fact of life.<br />Malloy has also written one of the funniest scenes in a book I have ever read.  Kevin is picked up at his crazy aunt's house by his father's mistress and the mistress' niece.  What follows had me laughing so hard I was gasping for breath.<br />Please, please, please buy this book.  I promise you will not regret it.  Malloy reminds me of Richard Russo with an even sharper sense of humour.  <br />And Brian, please tell me there will be a sequel to this book.  You can count on me lining up for the hardback!!	2004-03-15

I doubt I'll try any more.<br />The worst thing about this book is 'Lisar' the main character - annoying, ignorant, self-involved, stupid, whiny, and dull.  She seems to have no problem sleeping around with every guy she comes across, even having sexual fantasies about her own dead father, and then blames her boyfriend when he can't take her past.  Nothing is ever her fault, only everyone else's.  She has no friends whatsoever, except her gay male cousin, who is as vacuous, dull and stereotypical as she is. And for the entire book, all she does is complain - about her parents, her boyfriend, her life, her job, her boss, the dumb jock (that she still comes on to, even though she can't stand him) her size zero body etc. etc.  Trite and boring!<br />The second worst thing about this book are all the other characters - every one of them is such a cliche it's very difficult to swallow. Poor writing indeed.<br />A huge disappointment.	2002-10-10

I read almost all fantasy fiction that is published in the US and this is the worst I've seen yet.  Kate Elliott is a dreadful fantasy writer if this is an example of what she writes.<br />In King's Dragon, the characters are badly developed and dull, every minute little detail of the world Elliott has created is 'explained' to the detriment of what little plot line there is, and to the confusion of the reader.  And her attempts at poetry were laughable.<br />I waded through the entire book, determined to see if it got any better.  It didn't.  Then, I returned the next 3 books in the series to the bookstore for novels by much better fantasy writers - Margaret Weis and Tracy Hicks, and Terry Pratchett.<br />If you really want to read good fantasy epic fiction, try Terry Goodkind, Weis and Hicks, or George R.

I've waded through the first 4 Camulod books hoping they would get better, but The Fort at River's Bend finally did me in.<br />The premise of the 'real' story of Arthur and Merlyn is a wonderful idea, and could have been a phenomenal read by a different writer.  Whyte, however, isn't a good writer.  His prose is laborious, dull, and long-winded to say the least.  Merlyn is one of the stupidest characters I've ever come across, he rambles on in his head about nothing for page after page. The same information comes up on multiple pages with no new insights at all. The dialogue is stilted and unnatural, and the characters all sound alike.<br />Also, a good editor was vital for this kind of series, but unfortunately Whyte didn't have one.  There are so many inconsistencies and mistakes throughout the whole series that it made it impossible for me to enjoy the books. <br />The Fort at River's Bend is the worst however because absolutely nothing happens. 461 pages of a storyline that could have been condensed into less than 100. <br />I'm sorry to say I won't be reading any more of Whyte's books. The idea is captivating, the telling of it unfortunately is mind-numbing.	2002-01-26

Hank is the funniest novel character I have ever come across- insightful, macho in the way women just want to laugh at and then hug, and loveable. I loved him so much by the end of the book that I wanted to cry because I would never know what else happened to him. His wife too is beautifully written, as she reacts to Hank just the way I would - with an amused 'are-you-ever-going-to-grow-up-love?' feeling. <br />Books very rarely make me laugh out loud.  This one, I read much of while sitting at my local cafe and, at one point, I wished I was reading it at home because I soooo wanted to bellow with laughter which isn't normally recommended in a public place!<br />I cannot recommend this novel enough.  I read on average about 250 books a year, but Straight Man stands out as easily the best read I had in 2001.	2002-01-25

I normally read a book a day. This book took me over a week to read as I kept picking it up, reading ten pages and shoving it aside.  The characters were unlikeable, lethargic and did nothing. Even Iris, who is looking back on her life with regret, didn't really do anything - she just sat there and let everyone else around her have their lives destroyed. But, even then I didn't care enough to even hate Iris, she was just simply there like a whisper of smoke - no substance, no character, no appeal - vaccuous.<br />I expected much better, not only because of the Booker, but also because I have read all of Atwood's previous books and liked them very much.  This was just too long and too uninteresting to hold my attention.<br />An interesting idea but I think Atwood could have written it in a much more captivating way.  Very disappointing.	2001-06-18
