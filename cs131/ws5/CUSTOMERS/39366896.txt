Jim is a nice fellow, and I wouldn't want to see him die on my hands.  He won't last a round.\\" - Max Baer, 1935.<br /><br />To say Max Baer, owner of \\"perhaps the most powerful right hand in heavyweight history (IBHOF.com)\\" and a 10-1 favorite, was overconfident coming into the Braddock fight would be the biggest understatement of the century.  This book brings all of the compelling drama of the fight as well as the incredibly enthralling prelude leading up to it to life.  Jimmy Braddock working for 15 cents a day doing grunt work at the Jersey docks and being on the dole while his fight career was seemingly all but finished makes for quite a comeback.<br /><br />The feisty Joe Gould, described at the time with Braddock as \\"boxing's odd couple,\\" is brought to life along with Braddock's worrisome but caring wife Mae, the flashy and wise-cracking larger-than-life Baer, as well as the countless boxers that were contemporaries of Braddock including John Henry Lewis, Tommy Loughran, Joe Louis, Primo Carnera, and Max Schmeling.  I couldn't put it down - period.<br /><br />\\"His devotion to his wife and family and withal his attitude as champion of the world that he will fight anybody regardless of color, or creed, has made him the most popular champion in the history of the game.\\" - Damon Runyon, 1936	2005-06-12

John Singer makes for hardly a compelling protagonist and McCullers' characterization is lacking at best.  We never really get to know the real John Singer as we encounter a bevy of vapidly shallow supporting characters clinging to his very being.<br /><br />I kept waiting for the book to build plot development and come through with some profound theme or happening...but to no avail.  Many other classics of this genre far outweigh this effort -- including, but not limited to, Black Boy, Invisible Man, & To Kill a Mockingbird just to name a few.	2005-04-03

It was eminently enjoyable and, as all of Maugham's efforts, was a pleasure to read.  Maugham's gift with the English language is unsurpassed and vastly underrated.  Unfortunately, Up at the Villa just didn't have enough Maugham.  Not enough characterization or plot or theme development as I would have liked and have grown accustomed to with the genius of Maugham.  I have yet to see the movie with Kristin Scott Thomas and Sean Penn, although I'm sure I will in due time.  Overall, if you thoroughly enjoy Maugham as I do, check it out at the library.<br /><br />\\"That's what life's for - to take risks.\\"<br />- Rowley to Mary	2005-02-20

That being said, The Baron Son is not one of them.  It is, plain and simple, a different kind of \\"business\\" book.  Unlike the prosaic business tome, The Baron Son weaves an allegorical tale that both envelops and illuminates the reader with its intrigue and wisdom.  In summation, The Baron Son is well worth a read for anyone in any management or leadership position that is truly looking to galvanize his troops without any of the contrived, hackneyed drivel.<br /><br />Among the more indelible nuggets of sagacity are:<br /><br />\\"A man's thoughts are the foundations of his lifestyle.

Jackson, while providing intriguing insight into the Lakers locker room at times, tends to sugarcoat a lot of incidents and omits many goings on as if they never happened.<br /><br />Among the more interesting tidbits are: 1) Shaq telling Tex Winter to \\"shut the f*** up\\" and \\"Why don't you just mind your own business, old man?\\" during a film critique of Shaq's failure to help out on a screen roll on Chauncey Billups; 2) Jackson referring to KG as \\"wiry, almost like a corpse\\"; 3) Jackson's longtime nemesis Jerry Krause telling him prior to the 1998 NBA Draft that Michael Olowokandi will \\"be as good, if not better than Duncan\\"; & 4) Kobe telling Dr. Buss and Phil that, after the 2004 Finals debacle, he was \\"tired of being a sidekick.\\"<br /><br />Overall, an interesting read for any sports fan...perhaps just not as juicy as one might hope for.	2005-01-30

And, of course, their sadistic methods of murder, zamochit, and sexual deviancy are on full display from almost page one.  The plot, however, is full of more holes than a sinking ship.  Although I read this book in a few days(it is no doubt a page-turner), it wasn't nearly as suspenseful or enjoyable as The Big Bad Wolf.<br /><br />Not helping matters, the dreadfully abrupt ending proves painfully anticlimactic and rings hollow.

It is, however, an incredibly fun and highly engaging read.  While critics and readers continue to unfairly lampoon it ad nauseam, I, a self-admitted voracious reader who refuses to allow inane critics and amateur readers to unduly influence my reading selections, have found I Am Charlotte Simmons to be a devastatingly witty and immensely enthralling coming of age novel that, as is Tom Wolfe's custom, defies genre.<br /><br />Because a square peg fails to fit into a circle hole does not, believe it or not, necessarily make it a failure.  In turn, Wolfe's manifest lack of formulaic drivel (unlike the bulk of today's overhyped bestselling authors) makes for a much more unpredictable and free-flowing read.  Although long in length, the novel reads quickly and enjoyably from start to finish as we explore the innerworkings of his ever-callow heroine Charlotte Simmons and the many intriguing and incredibly well-characterized individuals ranging from the quasi-maternal high school teacher we all had in Mrs. Pennington, the nerdy liberal friend in Adam, the self-important (yet pensive) jock in Jojo Johanssen(Go Go Jojo!), Beverly(the pretentious roommate we love to hate), and the typical fraternity pissant, Hoyt(Yo, Hoyto!).<br /><br />In summation, while this is definitely not Wolfe's greatest, it is, however, his latest.  If you are anything greater than a cretin, you owe it to yourself to read it.  Some people have complained about the vocabulary being too bombastic or verbose.  If that's a problem for you, stick with John Grisham.	2005-01-22

Although he received financial security and immense critical acclaim upon the advent of Native Son, it was, however, Black Boy that firmly cemented his name amongst the civil rights pioneers of the 1940's.<br /><br />Is it merely a racial coming of age book? NO.  It is, without question, infinitely more than that.  It would be doing the book a grave disservice to merely pigeonhole it in that category.  Black Boy, whether you want to label it an autobiographical novel or a semi-fictional autobiography, provocatively enthralls and envelops the reader into young Richard's tangled web of racial injustice, coming of age, and more importantly, self-actualization.<br /><br />As we follow young Richard from his young formative years in rural Mississippi to Memphis to Chicago, we feel as if we grow with him and are rooting for him all the while to succeed and to grow both physically (from his almost constant lack of food) and mentally (his insatiable appetite for knowledge is something we all can learn from).<br /><br />Although I enjoyed the first 3/4 of the book the most (the ending was somewhat abrupt and the tales of his involvement with the Communist group in Chicago were not as engaging as those in the beginning), I came away both impressed and enlightened from reading this life account of a time and place so vastly different from today's society, yet not as far removed as some would have you think.	2005-01-19

Although it is more of a man's \\"diet\\" due to its rigorous exercise program, it is universal for the most part.  The diet itself is somewhat unrealistic seeing as most Americans cannot eat Zinczenko's almonds and bizarre snacks every couple of hours and eat the prescribed foods when eating out or on the go.  For example, fast food is terrible, but it is nonetheless an unfortunate reality for many time-pressed Americans - even those with 6 pack abs.<br /><br />The book earns its keep and 4 star rating largely upon its helpful photos, explanations of training regimens, and lastly for its actual \\"diet\\" information.  Recommended only if this is to be a lifestyle choice for those serious about fitness, not merely a fad diet that you will abandon after merely losing 5 or 10 lbs.	2005-01-19

Yes, Sinclair Lewis provides biting satire of the middle-aged conservative middle class white male that made a profound impact on both literature and society in general; he did, needless to say, coin the term for the conformist and prosaic middle class individual with his title character, Babbitt.  Laudable.  Genuinely laudable.<br /><br />Be that as it may, I do not need a whole book that, by the way is far from riveting, to preach to me ad nauseam of the dangers of conformity and capitulation to the powers that be.  Much better books out there actually(get this!) disseminate this message in a much more subtle and much less pedantic and didactic manner(e.g. A Clockwork Orange, Fahrenheit 451, Lord of the Flies, Brave New World, 1984, & The Razor's Edge to name just a few).  Painfully, Lewis incessantly introduces us to a slew of new unendearing and banal characters whose roles in the novel are less than substantive, if not just totally pointless.  Lewis remains one of the best-selling American novelists of the 20th Century.  That being said, he fails to belong in my opinion, however, in the 1st tier of truly sublime 20th Century literary talent such as Fitzgerald, Hemingway, Steinbeck, or even Vonnegut and Salinger.	2005-01-09
US	39366896	RUCABV1O8FTO5	0812589718	349337506	Daughter of God	Books	4	11	12	N	N	Highly engaging	As a caveat before reading Daughter of God, I must admonish you that while it bears some uncanny similarities to The Da Vinci Code, it is not, however, a mere facsimile.  It was, in fact, written before its much more popular counterpart.  So, the reviewers that mercilessly lampoon this tome as a lame attempt to cash in on the success of Dan Brown are patently erroneous.<br /><br />While the suspense is not as commanding as The Da Vinci Code, there is, perhaps, more character development in this novel.  The success of the historical fiction novel seems to always rest on a slippery slope.  Excessive embellishing of history or, conversely, excessive didactic reading of said history can irreparably destroy the foundation of the novel and make it either highly implausible or, even worse, amazingly boring.<br /><br />Lewis Perdue, much to my surprise, has succeeded in avoided these too-often-visited pitfalls.  Faith in God seems to pervade this novel and present itself as the central theme.  Zoe and Seth Ridgeway, our hero husband and wife protagonists, embark on a journey of unexpected peril and danger when presented with a bizarre offer involving looted Nazi art.  Their journeys take them from their pedestrian lives in America to the Old World in a confrontation with not only the horrific evils of the Nazi past but also with their own souls.  Overall, an engaging and provocative read.<br /><br />\\"Maybe you had a false certainty that's gone now,\\" Zoe said.  \\"Maybe all certainty is an illusion.\\"<br /><br />\\"I think that God delights in our searching,\\" Zoe pondered. \\"Maybe the ultimate truth is that there is no ultimate truth -- that what we're supposed to do is to keep searching all our lives.\\"	2004-12-04

Rated as the best football book ever by Sports Illustrated, Friday Night Lights fails to disappoint.  H.G. Bissinger, Pulitzer Prize in hand subsequent to his momentous achievement of Friday Night Lights, was unwelcome in Odessa to promote his newly successful book.  Seeing as he received hate mail up to including death threats as a result of this book, it is safe to assume that what the material is of a controversial and highly provocative nature.<br /><br />While this is certainly true, it is, pure and simple, a great book.  I didn't buy it for its controversial topics and political commentary, but rather for the blood, sweat, and tears that the compelling characters of Mike Winchell, Jerome McDougal, Ivory Christian, Boobie Miles, and the rest put forth on their quest for the Texas AAAAA State Championship.<br /><br />At the conclusion of the football season he spent with these dedicated young men of Permian High School, Bissinger hugged the players and cried when it was all said and done.  After reading this and feeling like you've gone through the trenches with these gridiron warriors, you might just feel like doing the same.	2004-11-27

In spite of the few references made to Cross's days on the Washington, D.C. PD and his relationship to his ex-wife Christine, for the most part I was totally in the clear and able to thoroughly enjoy an intricately woven tale of suspense, murder, deceit, and intrigue.<br /><br />The book moved quickly and practically read itself -- based upon both the compelling nature of the harrowing suspense as well as the 2-4 page chapters that seem to end just as you start them.  There exists, however, some holes in the storyline that, based upon Patterson's proclivity for churning out novels like there's no tomorrow, most likely stems from the fact that he was facing an imminent deadline and was forced to finish it perhaps before he was ready.<br /><br />I won't give anything away, but how they catch some of the bad guys left me shaking my head as to the plausibility of the storyline.  That being said, the book still was enjoyable and incredibly suspenseful.<br /><br />Contrary to popular opinion, it is The Wolf (his lovely affinity for zemochit and all), and not Alex Cross (the unrealistic supercop Patterson that makes him out to be), who makes the book worth reading from the start.  The sick and sadistic Wolf, in short, makes for a compellingly evil antagonist that undoubtedly keeps the pages turning.	2004-11-16

From page one, you will be, without a doubt, hooked.  Is there any better writer out there today in the mystery genre than Dennis Lehane? Nope.<br /><br />Welcome to Shutter Island, a small secluded island off of Boston Harbor accessible only via ferry -- and home to the macabre Ashecliffe Hospital for the Criminally Insane.  The protagonist, Teddy Daniels, is a US Marshal in search of an escaped prisoner (or patient as the hospital staff refer to them as) who murdered her children and is under care at Ashecliffe.  Teddy, a veteran of The Korean War, is a hard-boiled no-nonsense gruff kind of gent who has become an alcoholic and depressed from the death of his late wife.<br /><br />The story, which takes place in the early 1950's, creates a dark and morose feeling from the start -- not unlike Mystic River.  As the story progresses, facts and names begin to blur for both Teddy and the reader.  I (along with Teddy) was never quite sure what to believe or who to trust.  This makes for quite an addictive page-turner and an incredibly fun read that keeps you hanging until the last page.

It denounces the ostensibly tried and true low carb craze and throws it out the window.  \\"The key to postexercise recovery were carbohydrates: It provides the nutrient your body needs to replenish its stores of glycogen and stimulated insulin, the hormone that speeds nutrients to muscles for refuel and repair.\\" The key, of course, is combining protein and carbs immediately subsequent to workout in order not to burn muscle and let your rigorous workout be a total waste.<br /><br />That's just one example of this book's theory.  Among others, small and frequent meals are essential to speed up your metabolism and burn fat as well as keeping your muscles fueled and precluding your body burning its own muscle for fuel -- consequently storing fat cells.  Testosterone, needless to say, is the catalyst for this program.  How do you increase it? Simple: follow the diet and nutritional guidelines as presented in the book (plenty of good smoothies and recipes as well such as Penne with Italian Sausage and Spinach) as well as its detailed, although somewhat rudimentary, bodybuilding plan (cardio is minimal at best).<br /><br />The workout segment of the book comes complete with pictures of how to work out all body parts as well as how many sets and reps the author recommends(e.g. lying triceps extension with EZ Bar pics and instructions).  The whole upshot of the Testosterone Advantage Plan is this: you gain increased energy, lose fat, add muscle, increase metabolism, live longer, improve cardiovascular health, gain sexual stamina, eat frequently without feeling like you're on a diet, and gain mental alertness.  Sounds too good to be true, right? Probably is...but it's worth a look-see regardless.	2004-11-04

It did not, suffice to say, disappoint.<br /><br />As the Orient Express train travels from Istanbul to Paris, there occurs(get this) a murder.  Big shocker for Agatha Christie, right? Well, that's where the banality ends and the intricate guessing game begins.  With 12 passengers from seemingly very diverse backgrounds traveling in the same railroad car, our intrepid protagonist, Belgian sleuth Hercule Poirot, finds the mystery a most baffling and perplexing conundrum worth investigating.  Undoubtedly an easy and fun read that is an absolute must for any fan of mystery works.  Aussi, si vous pouvez parler un peu de francais, il est tres utile pour ce livre.	2004-09-28

Some of the salacious and outlandish goings-on seem almost implausible, if not absurdly bizarre.  Harriman proves to be the most singularly opportunistic individual that I have read about - possibly ever.  Although she does have her good points(although even her philanthropy seems perfunctory at best), Harriman(or should I say Digby, Churchill, or Heyward?) comes across as the most devilishly clever courtesan of the 20th Century.<br /><br />I recommend this account as one that makes for a most compelling, if not a trifle unnerving, read.  From her days as a seductive young debutante to her days as the wily big wheel of Democratic Party fundraising and later as the U.S. Ambassador to France, you'll find yourself intrigued as you read about this incredibly shrewd seductress.	2004-09-22

Although Maugham has changed much of Gauguin's history, both substantive and trivial, he has given us an amazingly poignant fictional novel that sheds light on what made the enigmatic genius tick.  As we explore the eclectic subtleties and bizarre idiosyncrasies of Charles Strickland, we feel magically transported back to a time and place that is so unlike today's world, yet somehow vividly alive and real.<br /><br />Seeing as it is written in 1st person narrative from a fictional author's point of view, we see England, France, and Tahiti from a unique firsthand perspective - all the while watching Strickland engage in his capriciously self-destructive, yet fastidiously predictable, behavior.  While Strickland is far from endearing and likeable, I nonetheless admire him for his resolve and unwavering tenacity which drove him to achieve greatness through art - on his own terms.<br /><br />\\"Sometimes people carry to such perfection the mask they have assumed that in due course they actually become the person they seem.\\"<br /><br />- W.

Maugham expressed his fervent regard for Cakes and Ale as what he referred to as maybe not his best work(it's no Of Human Bondage), yet what was his most enjoyable to write.<br /><br />As Maugham duly states in the introduction: \\"I like Cakes and Ale because in its pages lives for me again the woman with the lovely smile who was the model for Rosie Driffield.\\"<br /><br />As with all of Maugham's works, there exists an undeniable semi-autobiographical dynamic that makes the reading all the more plausible and life-like.  As in Of Human Bondage, we once again visit Blackstable and, not to my surprise, are introduced to a young orphaned boy(this time William Ashenden) who lives with his uncle(once again the town vicar)and who, of course, yearns to become a writer.  This is, however, where the similarities stop.  In the interest of those who have yet to read it, I will not disclose any plot happenings.  That being said, I must say that without doubt the character that steals the show is none other than the loving, beautiful, and perplexing Rosie.<br /><br />\\"I've had my time and I'm ready to call it a day.\\"<br /><br />- Rosie	2004-09-03

What makes this novel worth reading even after having seen the flick are the both subtle and striking divergences amongst the two art forms.<br /><br />For starters, the book is infinitely more juicier than the movie in terms of sheer debauchery and scathing wisecracks.  Secondly, Carmen is much more central in the book than in the movie -- not to mention the conspicuous absence of Eddie Mars' wife in the movie.  As a bonus, you get to hear \\"You're cute\\" uttered by the temptress many more times in the book.

Well...yes..and no.  Hemingway, to his credit, gives us a love story quite unlike any other Hemingway that you will ever read.  It's not about bullfighting, war in Italy or Spain, catching an oversized fish only to lose it, or anything that most neophytes associate Hemingway with.<br /><br />Hemingway, as is his custom, so masterfully creates the setting that you feel as if you are there on the white sandy beaches of France overlooking the majestic Mediterranean feeling the cool breeze while sipping one of David Bourne's mouthwatering martinis.  Hemingway gives us the young aspiring couple, David & Catherine Bourne, who seemingly have begun a loving, if not somewhat banal, relationship.<br /><br />Enter dark-skinned sultress Marita.  From then on, the story takes a dramatic shift from a borderline hackneyed account of love into a steamy and provocative love triangle that makes for compelling and incredibly enjoyable reading.  Perhaps due to the fact that it wasn't released until 1986, there exists a myriad of swear words and provocatively suggestive sexual scenes that no way would have made it into print earlier in Hemingway's life(e.g. the censorship of For Whom the Bell Tolls).<br /><br />Overall, I found it to be an absolute great summer or fall book that will whisk you away to Hemingway's incomparable setting of lovers in paradise.  Read it and ask yourself: Is this the real Hemingway hidden beneath the gruff exterior or is this merely an aberration? I believe the former.  Read it and enjoy.	2004-08-14

It reads not unlike an incredibly enthralling novel of deceit, selfishness, lust, greed, and underhanded connivances quite unlike any other.<br /><br />What makes this even more compelling is the incredible fact that it really happened.  It begins with a somewhat banal and inauspicious start as the author recounts the beginning of Gucci with its assiduous founder, Guccio Gucci.  As the family history unfolds, however, we find ourselves grossly immersed in the almost unbelievable sordid tales of the inimitable Gucci clan going from Guccio's three sons and how the most industrious of them, Aldo, built the Gucci empire almost single-handedly from a local phenomenon selling primarily handbags and loafers to worldwide acclaim selling a veritable cornucopia of luxury merchandise.  And that is, for all intents and purposes, where the meat of the infinitely bizarre story begins with the 3rd generation Gucci,  Maurizio, whose cold-blooded murder is eerily recounted on the 1st page of the book.<br /><br />Overall, I recommend this quasi-novel of nonfiction to anyone who enjoys a riveting yarn that reads like a murder mystery.  Invariably, it also makes for a great read for anyone in management on how to run, as well as how NOT to run, a business.	2004-08-01

Of which Russert says: &quot;Although Dad was perfectly happy to accept both my gift and my gratitude, he had no interest in stepping out of character or in becoming somebody he wasn't. Even in receiving a gift, Big Russ was teaching me a lesson.&quot;<br /><br /> After grilling David Duke and taking some heat for nailing him pretty good on his debut as moderator of Meet the Press, Russert called Big Russ to get the following take: &quot;I'll tell you something: if you're going to make a mistake by being too tough, make it with a Nazi.&quot;<br /><br /> Of Russert's obsession with the perennial losers, The Buffalo Bills, Big Russ coyly retorts: &quot;Bills fans will live forever.&quot; If you ask him why, he'll say, &quot;Because we won't die until we win the Super Bowl.&quot;<br /><br /> &quot;That's my dad. Big Russ. The most loyal and the most optimistic man I have ever known.&quot; Good stuff. From Russert's job as a garbage man all the way to his current position of NBC's Washington bureau chief, you'll undoubtedly enjoy the humorous and engaging anecdotes of Tim as he introspectively pays tribute to his inimitable mentor, Big Russ.	2004-07-28

There will be no room for mistakes either on your part,&quot; and Grant paused for a moment, &quot;or mine.&quot;<br /><br /> As witnessed above, Grant's no-nonsense candor and succinctness seem all too real as he unites his newly titled Army of the Susquehanna with a speech to General Couch. Grant Comes East has a little bit of everything for the Civil War buff -- personal intrigue, a compelling storyline, heated rivalries, and of course, it goes without saying, gruesome war violence that made me want to cringe at times(but who's to say I didn't enjoy it?).<br /><br /> I particularly enjoyed the telling of John Miller's tale and his joining of the famous Massachusetts all-black regiment, the thrusting of little-known Gen. Heintzelman into a major battle for the capital, the pivotal importance of Baltimore and ambivalent border state Maryland, as well as the capricious and irreverent Gens. Sickles and Pickett.<br /><br /> Recommended to all Civil War buffs -- even if you're North of the Mason Dixon Line.	2004-07-26

At times shocking, revealing, humorous, instructive, as well as cathartic, Blindsided makes for an incredibly refreshing read for anyone who has suffered through a chronic illness or hospitalization(such as myself) or who simply enjoys a profoundly uplifting memoir.<br />Cohen will surprise you with his surprising candor and dry humor.  Especially amusing was his unbridled disdain for the ostensibly helpless light in which Ladies Home Journal cast him in after interviewing Meredith.  Making him out to be a pitiful invalid and Meredith as the incessantly weeping caretaker was far from the truth, Richard says.

Written over 50 years ago, I, Robot is somewhat dated at times with its archaic technological references.  Secondly, the book appears to be as closely related to the movie as Will Smith is to the main protagonists -- which is absolutely nil.  Thirdly, the book is more of a collection of 9 short stories -- rather than a novel with one male protagonist -- as the movie evidently is.<br />While exhibiting little substance at times, I, Robot is, however, a fun and easy read that is well told for the first 6 stories and then somewhat drops off into predictable and mundane tales for the last three yarns.  I particularly enjoyed the tales of the silent babysitting robot Robbie, the mindreading robot Herbie, the quasi-autonomous Speedy, and the ingeniously crafted robot politician, Stephen Byerley.  Without a doubt, I found I, Robot enjoyable -- just don't expect some monumental work of greatness.  It is what it is -- a perfectly fun read for the summer.	2004-07-13

Furthermore, the less than creative book cover didn't exactly help matters either.  So, I decided to read The Razor's Edge first and, having thoroughly enjoyed said work, finally delved into Of Human Bondage hoping for more of the same.<br />While similar elements amongst the two books do exist, Of Human Bondage exists as a more inviting and revealing work of personal introspection that, having been written almost 30 years prior to The Razor's Edge when Maugham was much younger, possesses much more passion and energy as well.<br />It exists, for all intents and purposes, as a thinly veiled autobiographical work of intense reflection.  While W. Somerset Maugham was stigmatized from a young age with a severe stuttering problem, he conveniently gives Philip Carey his own seemingly irreparable stigma -- a clubfoot.  As I followed Philip Carey through his many travails from England to Germany to Paris and back to London, I truly became enveloped in the story quite unlike any other.  As Carey finds himself, he also discovers for the first time unadulterated autonomy, free will, and, ultimately, freedom from human bondage.<br />As Cronshaw tells Philip, the meaning of life cannot be told to others; it is, instead, like a Persian rug with intricate weavings and complex designs, a mystery that can only be discovered by those who seek it out.  This book pulls you in and never lets go until the last page -- even then you don't want it to end.  A most powerful, if not amazingly sage, message is being conveyed via the tumultuous tale of Philip Carey - it is only through choosing the path that allows for complete happiness, irrespective of what others want you to do, that one can truly have his soul fulfilled.  As Philip duly states, &quot;After all, I can only try.  Thegreat thing in life is to take risks.&quot;<br />Of Human Bondage exists as the rarest of creatures - a classic that is both incredibly enjoyable and easily readable...as well as eminently profound.  Maugham is, without a doubt in my mind, vastly underrated in today's literature.	2004-07-12

It does, however, make a great starting point when recounting the prodigious heroics of the likes of the following unsung heroes: the dauntless Vietnam Medal of Honor award winner Master Sgt. Roy Benavidez, the valiant Marines in the Battle of Peleliu Island, the tenacious naturalist John Wesley Powell as he fearlessly led his expedition into The Great Unknown of the Grand Canyon, the steadfast Navajo Chief Manuelito who stood his ground against an unjust American government, the incredibly intrepid blood-spattered John Lewis fighting peacefully against grievous disenfranchisement and racism, and the amazingly selfless Corporal Mitchell Red Cloud as he dauntlessly gave his life on the incomparably bloody Hill 123 in Korea so that others may live.<br />John McCain and Mark Salter masterfully employ these infinitely brave individuals, as well as many more that I have omitted, to embody the highly sought after, yet oftentimes elusive, virtue of courage.  Why Courage Matters proves to be a most enjoyable and edifying read which, although quite short, will indubitably, not unlike JFK's Profiles in Courage, leave a profoundly indelible mark on its reader.<br />&quot;It is better to die on your feet than to live on your knees!&quot;<br />- Emiliano Zapata	2004-06-27

And, I might add, for good reason.  Although written in 1st person novel form from the perspective of the selflessly valiant Cornelia ten Boom, it is, of course, the true story of one family's almost unfathomable degree of limitless giving and unwavering altruism that saved many of lives during the nihilistic hate-filled Nazi regime in Holland, where the Gestapo as well as Dutch collaborators were pervasively ubiquitous and inexorably replete with hate and ineluctably devoid of both reason and love.<br />While reading, I felt a veritable melange of emotions running the gamut from sadness, anger, despair, and hope.  Thanks to the wonderful writing, you feel like you're reading a novel -- although one that is all too harrowing and real.  As Betsie quotes the Bible and says, \\"Give thanks in all circumstances,\\" she subsequently says \\"Thanks for the fleas\\" -- a moment that demonstrated that God DOES work in mysterious ways.  Without giving away anything that happens, I strongly exhort you to read The Hiding Place -- a book that stays with you long after you have turned the last page.<br />\\"No pit is so deep that He is not deeper still.\\"<br />- Betsie ten Boom	2004-06-26

The morose setting of a fictitious New England town in the cold winter adds to the gloom and dreariness of an already hopeless milieu engendered by the abject despair of title character Ethan and the incorrigible antagonism of his wife, Zeena.<br />I didn't know whether to pity Ethan - or to laugh at him. His weak lack of resolve against the insufferably truculent and extremely annoying Zeena as well as his glaring inability to make his own decisions both contribute to make this book to be anything but a &quot;page-turner&quot; -- to put it mildly. Ethan is nothing short of pathetic. I empathize with Mattie to a certain degree, yet the ending (with Mattie) of this short novella is so pathetic that I was left shaking my head -- at how stupid they all are.<br />I gave it a generous 3 stars for its pertinent message of &quot;hey, don't be like us because we're morons.&quot; While I highly enjoyed Wharton's The House of Mirth, this book, in essence, is no House of Mirth - in more ways than one.	2004-06-23

Well, upon further review after reading every page(and enjoying every one no less), I can irrefutably promulgate that Rebecca is, indeed, a classic which should doubtless be read -- and enjoyed -- by both sexes.<br />Rebecca is nothing short of an archetype of the mystery/suspense genre.  Written in 1938, it quickly became an instant bestseller -- and for good reason.  In the paradoxical world of Manderley, where you feel a certain awe due to the fictional mansion's opulence and wonder coupled with a peculiar eerie malaise, Du Maurier has created a most bizarre character in the house itself.<br />Her masterful imagery, deft characterization of the new Mrs. de Winter, the enigmatic maxim, the creepy but ingeniously crafted Mrs. Danvers, the decadent Jack Favell, the incorrigibly pompous Mrs. Van Hopper, the tacitly loyal Frith, and, of course, the character that, although deceased from the beginning, eerily pervades the already cryptic landscape of Manderley, as well as the book itself, from page one - Rebecca.  Rebecca exists as an inscrutable mystery that begs us to press on and uncover the hidden truth as we enjoy superb prose all the while -- truly a most captivating read.	2004-06-20

It is, without a doubt, not on the same incomparable level of supremacy as A Confederacy of Dunces.  It is, however, entertaining and provocative.  You follow a New Orleans stockbroker, Binx Bolling, as he lives his life vicariously through movies and their stars.<br />Binx finds himself at a veritable crossroads at the age of 30 as he has become incredibly disillusioned in a mundane world replete with phoniness and mediocrity.  As he attempts to escape from this banality via movies and women, he finds that he is, along with his neurotic cousin Kate, searching for meaning in an otherwise fruitless life.

Ender, I soon came to learn, is the featured protagonist, a 6 year-old boy quite unlike any other living in Greensboro, NC.  Quite unlike any other in the sense that he exists with the superlative distinction that he is, without doubt, the genius of geniuses.<br />Being tested from the start by being picked on by older boys, Ender makes a rather indelible impression on the reader from the first chapter -- one of supreme courage, wit, and.....well...genius.  To make the book enticing without giving anything away, I will succinctly state that Ender is drafted into the I.F.(International Fleet) army and thrust into learning not only how to win complex and immensely challenging Battle Games, but also valuable life lessons along the way.  In a book that succeeds on multiple levels, you find yourself highly entertained and wanting to find out what happens next -- as well as learning from the daunting adversity that Ender incessantly faces and the ingenious methods and strategies that he uses to masterfully overcome it.<br />In closing, I recommend Ender's Game to anyone from 9 to 90.  Not only can kids learn a great deal from this book, but adults can, without a doubt, as well -- especially from a leadership or management perspective.<br />\\"Winning is everything because without it there is nothing.\\"<br />- Mazer Rackham	2004-06-06

Salinger tour with this two story compilation that seemingly concludes (at least for now) the enthrallingly enigmatic, not to mention neurotic, Glass family.<br />While both are told via Buddy's first person narrator perspective, Raise High the Roof Beam is a far superior effort, although I must admit that I thoroughly enjoyed Seymour: An Introduction as well -- just not as immensely as its predecessor.  After reading both, one seems to learn a great deal more about Buddy, Boo Boo, Les and Bessie, Walt, and Franny &amp; Zooey than Seymour himself.  Buddy admittedly refuses to delve into the years immediately prior to Seymour's suicide(deftly written in A Perfect Day for Bananafish), but rather touches solely on his youthful years while starring on &quot;It's A Wise Child.&quot;  This book is worth the price alone due to the profound Taoist tale Seymour told Franny when she was a baby -- as well as Buddy's hilarious blowup at the insufferably annoying Matron of Honor.<br />&quot;My atoms, moreover, are arranged to make me constitutionally inclined to believe that where there's smoke there's usually strawberry Jello, seldom fire.&quot; - Buddy	2004-06-02

Perhaps he is undervalued in the scheme of things as far as his vast influence over the genre as a whole.  Of late, however, he has received the credit he duly deserves since The Maltese Falcon is ranked as the #56 novel of the 20th Century by the Modern Library.<br />Featuring the irrepressible straight-shooter Sam Spade and his unforgettably cunning and sexy female counterpart Brigid O'Shaughnessy, The Maltese Falcon has enough twists and turns to make your head spin.  As if these two indelible characters and the super suave dialogue weren't enough, Hammett throws in such incomparable characters as The Fat Man (appropriately named Gutman), the effeminate weasel Joel Cairo, and, of course, the relentlessly maligned Wilmer, or The Undersized Shadow as the chapter is titled.<br />Despite all of these great characters that complement the story, none shines as brightly as our gruff, cynical, and mercilessly shrewd hero and lady's man, Sam Spade.  He means what he says and says what he means - you gotta love it.  If you even remotely value fine (and highly entertaining) literature that is a great read even after having seen the equally great movie, then add this to your wish list today.<br />\\"By Gad, sir, you are a character!\\" - Gutman to Spade	2004-05-31

Well, The Razor's Edge is the exception to the rule.  It is not only the mark of a good book, but a sublime storyteller.  The incredible combination of an extraordinary melange of remarkably eclectic and certifiably unforgettable characters, a masterfully woven premise of singular quality, as well as a suave and melodious prose that virtually flows off of the page all emanate early and often from Maugham's pen in The Razor's Edge.<br />While much has been made of the inscrutable idealist Larry Darrell, I found myself equally fascinated by the beautiful, yet cold and predictable Isabel, the banality of everyman Gray, the irrepressible flair of Elliott Templeton, the vague goings-on of Maugham, and, last but not least, the expressly antithetical, yet similarly intriguing, tales of Suzanne Bouvier and Sophie Macdonald. What makes The Razor's Edge so engrossingly captivating is the dichotomy of Maugham employing himself as the first person narrator and the irrefutable fact that the book draws from a vast multitude of his personal experiences -- both of which add immensely to the verisimilitude of the experience.  In short, it has the feel of a memoir of sorts -- a true testament to Maugham's genius.<br />&quot;He's the idealist, he's the dreamer of a beautiful dream, and even if the dream doesn't come true, it's rather thrilling to have dreamt it.&quot; - Maugham	2004-05-25

She's such....well.. an enigma, that she's difficult to put a finger on (no pun intended).  Is she an antihero, a bona fide heroine, or somewhere stuck in the middle? In any event, at times I shook my head in disgust at some of her less than wise decisions, while I applauded and cheered as she undergoes a striking, yet tumultuous, epiphany of sorts that makes her all the more endearing and palpably real to the reader.<br /><br />Seemingly infinite wealth, preeminent social status, and unmitigated decadence form the shaky foundation of Edith Wharton's fictional and frictional, yet highly plausible, house -- a house that, ironically enough, is conspicuously devoid of mirth.  There exists, however, a method to Wharton's madness.  As the bible verse(Ecl 7:4) states from which she nabbed the title, \\"...the heart of fools is in the house of mirth.\\"  As Lily is inexorably extricated from this house of miserable frivolity, I found it increasingly difficult to nonchalantly label Lily a failure, but rather as a heroine of noble courage.<br /><br />The sheer genius of Wharton's amazingly fluid and enormously readable prose deftly concludes with \\"the word which made all clear\\" for Lily Bart and Lawrence Selden.  The beauty of this is that Wharton does not lower herself and overtly spell it out to the reader as so many hackneyed authors do; instead, she places her blind faith in the astuteness of the reader to discern for oneself.<br />Note: for those ordering the large print version, it is well worth it for the contemporary reviews written in 1905 as well as Edith Wharton's correspondences to Charles Scribner, but do not, however, read the intro by Elizabeth Hardwick before the text due to the fact that she inexcusably reveals the denouement in her so-called \\"introduction.\\"	2004-05-20

I enjoyed Nine Stories just as, if not more than, Franny &amp; Zooey and Catcher.

Rated the #44 fiction novel of the 20th Century by The Modern Library, I felt obliged to give it a read.  Firstly, it is entirely unfair, and furthermore foolishly inane, to even begin to compare it to the dystopian genre of Brave New World.  It's apples and oranges.<br />The true mark of a genius is the irrefutable fact that his work cannot, and should not, be fastidiously placed in a box, or in essence shortsightedly confined to a category.  That is readily apparent with Huxley, and more importantly Point Counter Point.  A prodigious and incendiary denunciation of 1920s English aristocracy and their partners in crime, the supercilious intelligentsia.  Huxley exposes them for nothing short of morally bankrupt, intellectually vacuous, and hopelessly incorrigible.<br />Point Counter Point strikes me as a book for the more intelligent among us, i.e., those who strive to read challenging and illuminating literature that is not only profound, but highly enjoyable as well.  You will treat yourself to intensely stimulating debates between Huxley's eclectic cast of characters as they argue the merits of science, religion, communism, fascism, capitalism, fidelity, etc, etc, etc.  Although Brave New World receives all of the ink (and rightly so), Point Counter Point makes an incontrovertible case that it is a definitive classic in its own right.	2004-05-09

While the story of a boy and a tiger sailing across the Pacific in a lifeboat may seem implausible, if not downright silly, to many from the outset (myself included), the whole premise of this unbelievable scenario is expressly central to the theme of the book.<br />In a society where religion is increasingly derided and looked down upon by many, it takes a 16 year-old Indian boy and the incredibly original bengal tiger Richard Parker to teach us the power of faith and reaffirm the existence of God - as well as the wonder of animals and zoos.

Rated the #22 fiction book of the 20th Century, Appointment in Samarra did not disappoint.  Being a huge Fitzgerald and Hemingway enthusiast and seeing how both recommended this book wholeheartedly, I concluded it to be a can't miss prospect.  Something about the shameless decadence, the seemingly limitless ambition, &amp; the uproariously good times that were had during The Jazz Age made it such a riveting and inimitable setting for the likes of Fitzgerald, Hemingway, and John O'Hara.  While I wouldn't quite include O'Hara in a class with his two contemporaries, Appointment in Samarra does, however, make a strong case for its serious inclusion not too far behind such works as The Great Gatsby, The Sun Also Rises, etc.<br />What strikes me as a distinct divergence from such works as The Great Gatsby is that it, unlike Gatsby, it takes place at the onset of The Great Depression - just after Gatsby's epoch.  So, in a sense, Appointment is not all fun and games and infinite debauchery without any foreseeable repercussions.  Of Fitzgerald's works, I liken it most to The Beautiful and Damned - the perpetual dynamics of a moral vacuum, alcoholism, self-destructive proclivities, failed relationships, adultery, etc. are all readily present -- as is the constant and unflagging conviction of Julian as he steadfastly holds on to any vestige of his integrity through it all.<br />In summation, the extraordinarily crass (although realistic and highly entertaining) dialogue, superb characterization of a veritable endless array of diverse individuals, &amp; a fluid and genuinely suspenseful plot are what make this a great, although somewhat morose, American novel not to be missed.	2004-04-25

Read Franny &amp; Zooey and find out.  Two brooding, yet illuminating short stories published in The New Yorker 2 years apart, Franny &amp; Zooey exists as a book with two inseparably joined stories on one level; conversely they, almost without exception, also exist as two patently disparate short stories unique unto themselves.<br />Although written in 3rd person, the amount of not so infrequent profound introspection that emanates from the acutely neurotic Franny &amp; Zooey leaves one in awe of Salinger's unimpeachable acumen for fiction.  For those in doubt, just read the first page and witness Salinger's penchant for jaw-dropping prose as he somehow magically transmogrifies a rather uneventful setting into an engrossingly captivating one.<br />Franny is acutely plagued by an insufferable disillusionment in a name-dropping pedantic collegiate environment that has sapped her passion for college and the cookie cutter lifestyle that invariably will accompany it soon after.  Zooey's unremitting, if not humorous, cynicism and his biting sardonic commentary on his overbearing mother, Franny's esoteric religious beliefs, and on society in general make a perfect yin for Franny's yang.<br />&quot;Sometimes I think that knowledge-when it's knowledge for knowledge's sake, anyway-is the worst of all.&quot;<br />- Franny	2004-04-21

And...this is a good thing.  While certain elements of the novel tend to be formulaic, there exists, however, a refreshing vibrancy that emanates from the wistful idealism of our hero protagonist Willie Traynor and his anything but unlikable friend and confidant Miss Callie.  For Grisham fans, it is a return to the idyllic fictional Mississippi town of Clanton in Ford County set in the 1970s -- last visited in A Time To Kill.  Also reprising their roles are the enigmatic divorce lawyer Harry Rex and the slimy and slippery Lucien Wilbanks.<br />What makes this book unique and refreshing is that it is not a mere &quot;legal thriller&quot; recounting a courtroom drama ad nauseam.  Told from a callow journalist's point of view, it serves to break the mold of sorts.  We are taken along for the bumpy, yet highly enjoyable ride as Willie Traynor opines with admirable conviction in his editorials for his newly acquired Clanton Times on topics ranging from Vietnam, Bargain Center, the Padgitt trial, etc.<br />Traynor's idealism and courage of conviction are contagious and make the book worth reading alone.  Grisham's well-placed humor, able characterization, &amp; seemingly effortless insertion of multidimensional supporting characters such as Sam, Lucien, Margaret, &amp; Baggy also add to the story immensely.

For the neophytes reading this, Invisible Man is not merely &quot;a book about overcoming racial injustice&quot; -- as it would appear on the surface to many.  To typecast this work in such a way would do nothing short of a grave disservice to the late Ellison.  Invisible Man, contrarily, transcends mere race and delves into, as Ellison calls it, &quot;the beautiful absurdity of the American identity.&quot;<br />We are all aiding and abetting lies, Ellison says, by judging others in a coldly insular &amp; scientifically calculated manner based solely upon one's outward appearance -- not unlike the The Brotherhood, Norton, Bledsoe, &amp; Ras the Exhorter.  As our hapless (and interestingly nameless), yet undeniably endearing, protagonist astutely states, &quot;The truth is the light and light is the truth.&quot; As he is invisible without truth, the truth, conversely, is unattainable without light.<br />Ellison takes us on a circuitous, if not tumultuous, road to self-awareness that is tragically achieved through his naive and idealistic dreams being systematically shattered by the irrepressibly cynical charlatans in whom he has put his unconditional trust such as the Iago-like Brother Jack.  In a book where perception is anything but reality, Ellison's cryptic characters (such as Brother Jack and his inexplicable use of a foreign language and inscrutable glass eye as well as the ostensibly omnipresent, yet never present, Rinehart) without doubt add to this mysterious, yet pervasive, feeling of uncontrollable helplessness of our protagonist who is being inexorably jettisoned into a blurry chaotic world grossly devoid of right and wrong.<br />Two FYIs: Appropriately, the only letters on the book cover which become &quot;invisible&quot; when looked at from a distance are the two I's.  Also: read the prologue again after reading the entire book seeing, as Ellison succinctly states in both the prologue and epilogue, &quot;The end was in the beginning and lies far ahead.&quot;seeing, as Ellison succinctly states in both the prologue and epilogue, &quot;The end was in the beginning and lies far ahead.&quot;	2004-04-09

In essence, yes, Faulkner did brazenly pave a new road that had been yet to be traveled by previous authors.  His prolific use of literary elements, many of which are necessary to the story and some of which are not, emanate early and often throughout The Sound and the Fury.  His seemingly effortless shift between past and present, between Benjy, Quentin, &amp; Jason is undeniably masterful.<br />With all of this adulation, my review thus far sounds like nothing short of a 5 star review.  While Faulkner's genius is irrefutably compelling, the story is anything but.  I just feel that the underlying story of the dissolution of a Southern family (i.e. the Southern way of life), none of which are likable, was as an exercise in banality, if not futility -- regardless of the literary talent bestowed upon it.<br />I like Southern literature, but this would not be included in my top 100, let alone top 10.

From threats both near and far, Ross was under a seemingly insurmountable burden to vote for impeachment, he chose, however, to exhibit \\"the courage to vote according to the dictates of my judgment and for the highest good of the country.\\"  This courage to uphold the Constitution and ignore the rabble rouser constituents of his native Kansas and the ever-strident Radical Republicans emboldened him to cast the deciding vote in acquitting President Andrew Johnson from certifiable impeachment -- by one vote.  In doing so, Ross sagaciously restored order in the most tumultuous time in our history, and more importantly, forever rescued the dwindling autonomy of the executive branch from an increasingly partisan Congressional autocracy.<br />While this profound book chronicles the trials and tribulations of an impressive, yet eclectic, group of Senators all the way from the courageous John Quincy Adams up until the principled Robert A.

For those who enjoy stellar, if not unpredictable, imagery and use of literary tools to the hilt, this book will energize you. Conversely, for those who are just looking for an engrossing read, this book fits the mold as well. Lowry, in what is still a truly seminal and novel approach, employs an amazingly diverse array of literary elements in a semi-autobiographical manner that make the read more rewarding for the more serious reader.<br />In the first chapter, which begins on the fittingly gloomy Day of the Dead in Quauhnahuac, Mexico, Lowry immediately sets the tone of the entire novel as we encounter our anti-hero, The Consul, in a perpetual drunken stupor.  Chapter 2 begins, oddly enough, on the same day -- one year later in 1939. For the remainder of the book, one follows in the wobbly footsteps of the drunken Consul for what amounts to be 12 hours.<br />The reader is led on a meandering, if not convoluted, path between lucid sobriety and hazy drunkenness, between the past and the present, &amp; between an ominous and foreboding sense of impending doom to a renewed feeling of hope -- all in an extraordinarily masterful way. For those who discount this book as simply &quot;a book about a drunk,&quot; you do nothing more than flaunt your ignorance; it is, instead, a book that speaks uniquely of the human condition, free will, remorse, reconciliation, duplicity, and the duality of despondency and hope.<br />&quot;The novel can be read simply as a story which you can skip if you want. It can be read as a story you will get more out of if you don't skip. It can be regarded as a kind of symphony, or in another way as a kind of opera--or even a horse opera. It is hot music, a poem, a song, a comedy, a farce, and so forth. It is superficial, profound, entertaining, and boring, according to taste.

They are, indubitably, evil people who HAVE committed evil deeds which are beyond the pale. Have the liberals learned from the appeasement-minded Neville Chamberlain? Appeasement with ruthless tyrannical dictators is not a solution -- it's a recipe for disaster. As Hannity says, &quot;Excuse me for letting my face get in the way of your boot, Mr. Hussein.&quot;<br />Much to my chagrin, the liberals, with their inexplicable accommodation to madmen, are sometimes just as guilty in fueling the fire of terrorism. As Hannity astutely states, &quot;Accommodation only leads to escalation.

While many may know vaguely of the legendary tale of the real Cyrano, few have surprisingly actually read this delightful gem of a play based only nominally on the man himself.  Cyrano de Bergerac incorporates all that is 17th century France in a nutshell: the romance, wit, bombast, refinement, gallantry, and pompousness.  Cyrano embodies all of these and more.<br />Rostand uses a seemingly endless flow of great witticisms and a keen use of wordplay that make the play enjoyable and fun to read.  It reads similarly to a Shakespeare comedy -- albeit in a much more fluid and smooth manner.  The outlandish tales of Cyrano single-handedly defeating 100 men in battle, of him being a scientist, poet, and warrior all at once make for an outrageously entertaining tale of bombast and hyperbole.  Cyrano, when exhorted to seek his true love Roxane by his friend Le Bret, exclaims, &quot;Come now, think a moment: this nose of mine, which precedes me by a quarter of an inch everywhere I go, forbids me ever to dream of being loved by even an ugly woman.&quot;<br />Our hero, who personifies the intrepid soldier on the battlefield, rebuffs Le Bret's persistence by retorting, &quot;So that she'll laugh in my face? No! That's the one thing in the world that I fear!&quot; Cyrano, our affable and valiant swashbuckling hero, reveals that he is, despite the brazen posturing, a mere human after all.  And, like everyone else, possesses his own unique set of fears.  In the face of awkward human imperfection, Cyrano teaches us the need to transcend -- that love of another's soul must, in order for true happiness to be fully achieved, supersede the shallowness of physical appearance.  A great lesson that more people should learn.<br />&quot;Pardon me for having involved you in a disastrous adventure.&quot;<br />Edmond Rostand to the actor portraying Cyrano minutes before the play's initial performance.ortraying Cyrano minutes before the play's initial performance.	2004-03-10

Told in the form of an allegory of an individual named Ordinary, The Dream Giver takes him on a journey from his land of Familiar and away from his Comfort Zone into the land of the unknown as he pursues his Dream.  As Ordinary disembarks on his journey in pursuit of his Dream, he is confronted by Border Bullies (people you know who try to, in one way or another, deter you from your dream, and Giants, or obstacles that one must confront on one's way to fulfillment of one's Big Dream.<br />While everyone has a Dream, Wilkinson points out, not everyone follows through with it due to all of the foreboding obstacles, perseverance, and imminent confrontation that it will entail in achieving it.  Leaving one's Comfort Zone, and the stability and peace of mind that accompanies it, seems to be the most difficult course of all.  Once abandoned, Wilkinson says, one will doubtless encounter alarmists, defeatists, and antagonists who will try with reckless abandon to halt your progress for one reason or the other including being motivated by fear of your failure -- as well as fear of your success.  Giants, such as lack of resources, an immovable bureaucracy, &amp; physical burdens must be conquered on the way as well.  While all of this may seem perhaps idealistic and simplistic to some(and it is at times), The Dream Giver is nonetheless a great read that will, if nothing else, surely open your eyes and make you take a second look at everything around you in your current milieu - and, at best, could possibly change your life.

So, naturally I felt most inclined to read it -- finally.  I found it enjoyable, witty, and entertaining.  In Shakespeare's use of blithe love, fairies, magic, the forest, &amp; a play within a play, I found similar, if not redundant elements seen innumerably in his other works.  I did, however, find some seemingly prosaic, yet surprisingly profound social overtones on both love and marriage.<br />The whimsical insouciance of the young Lysander, Hermia, Helena, and Demetrius emanates in stark contrast to the more mundane, if not rigid, love of Theseus and Hippolyta.  This inevitably provokes thought on the very underpinnings of love.  Also, another impending paradox of sorts presents itself with the love of the two young couples.  While Lysander and Hermia enjoy a jovial and reciprocal brand of love, conversely Helena and Demetrius enjoy, courtesy of one of Shakespeare's most famous characters, Robin Goodfellow(aka Puck), a forced, yet unwitting, brand of love.  The two couples' love, while diametrically opposite, nevertheless results in the same ineluctable and identical outcome -- marriage.  While true love may indeed be blind as in the former case, Shakespeare, however, also makes a case that some love is perhaps forced, if not arbitrary, as well -- as in the case of Demetrius and Helena.  As the two couple leave the fairies, the wildwoods, and the forest, a place that represents a world of infinite freedom, chaos, and with them lessened inhibitions, the lovers end the story by arriving at the Athenian Court, a place that represents a return to decorum, refinement, and quite possibly, confinement.<br />&quot;Lord, what fools these mortals be!&quot; - Puck	2004-03-10

Yeah, you learn intriguing insider tidbits and some sleaze on politicians, pundits, and the like, but that's just the tip of the proverbial iceberg.  For instance, Tucker reveals how his \\"biggest fan\\" claimed that he violated her in a restaurant in plain view of others, and in a bloody manner to boot, only to send him an email a month after the supposed incident proclaiming, \\"You're great.\\"<br />From a deranged psychiatrist who went coastal on Tucker claiming he was crazy to his hilarious fan feedback that he sent back to demented fans to the ingenious letter that he composed to bail out his college roommate from an econ midterm, you'll laugh out loud almost incessantly.  Tucker tells of his drunk radio interview from the infamous Dick Morris suite and of the other Tucker Carlson and how he was mistaken before a speech as this individual(hilarious).  His tells of hi interviews with an admittedly drunk Jim Traficant who, by the way, groped the CNN makeup girl.<br />A few months later, after he was facing 60 years in prison and $2 Million in fines for rackateering, extortion, and bribery, Traficant came on again, this time safely by remote, pleading, \\"Tell the girls at CNN that if I get convicted, I'm going to be looking for conjugal visits.\\"  Good stuff.	2004-03-05

I was expecting a somewhat predictable, and hence banal, scenario of Grant taking Lee to the woodshed as US forces are repeatedly bolstered while Lee's are repeatedly weakened.  Well, suffice to say, it is anything but banal and predictable (despite, of course, the final outcome).<br />One is introduced to the two dynamic, if not controversial, leaders of the latter half of the war that were instrumental in Grant's success: the impetuous, demanding, &amp; fiery General Philip Sheridan and the unrelenting, aggressive, &amp; uncouth General William T. Sherman.  I would be remiss without having mentioned the most obvious new entry -- the only man ever able to match wits with Robert E. Lee: General Ulysses S. Grant.  Was he a great strategist? Was he a raging alcoholic? How exactly was his relationship with Lincoln? - and with his subordinates (including Meade)?<br />All of these and many more questions are answered in this wonderfully woven tale that masterfully takes the reader from the bloody aftermath of Gettysburg to the trying siege of Petersberg all the way to the solemn occasion at Appomattox Court House.  The incredible heroism of Joshua Chamberlain, the tragedies of JEB Stuart &amp; A.P. Hill, the genius of Lee, the savagery of Sherman, &amp; the vastly contrasting leadership styles of Abraham Lincoln and Jefferson Davis are all on full display in The Last Full Measure.<br />&quot;War is for the participants a test of character; it makes bad men worse and good men better.&quot;<br />- Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain	2004-03-03

If you are looking for some didactic manual on how to ride a mountain bike, then, well, you've come to the wrong place.  If you are, however, searching for a good book that both inspires and illuminates the mind while chronicling both enthralling and humorous mountain biking anecdotes, then, without doubt, you have come to the right place.  Wayne Lankford, not unlike most of us, was a working stiff who spent most of his free time doing seemingly important stuff and on the couch watching TV.  Then, much to his credit, the author began to think, in more ways than one, outside of the box.<br />Mountain biking, in all of its beautiful simplicity, takes one away from the box and the all-too-familiar surroundings of your plush sofa and gigantic TV and deluxe surround sound setup of one's TV room into a far more rewarding and fulfilling milieu called The Bike Path.  One may find The Bike Path, as in all new endeavors, an unfamiliar and, due to lack of use, unworn path, yet one that ultimately, if given the opportunity, will lead to an extraordinary destination.<br />For someone like me who is not an avid mountain biker, I can attest to the fact that this is a journey that anyone can enjoy -- regardless of your love for mountain biking.  Once you've begun the journey, you all but envelop yourself in the book and are transported to a place of introspection that you are sure to find both transcendentally cathartic as well as indelibly rewarding.<br />&quot;We are, you and I, at some sort of intersection right now.  This one's called the Bike Path.  You are invited to follow.  Who knows what you'll find just up the trail from here.&quot;<br />-Wayne Lankford	2004-03-02

The true essence of this historical allegory, yet eerily accurate novel is much more than that of its central protagonist Rubashov.  As Rubashov's fears of the &quot;Neanderthalers&quot; such as Gletkin and the mysterious No. 1 usurping his command become realized, the original revolutionaries are summarily deposed.<br />The merciless gulag as witnessed in the novel, the monolithic nature of The Party, the sordid ubiquity of No.1's steely portrait, the systematic elimination of all who hold divergent beliefs from those of The Party, the categorical taking of one's free will, &amp; the neverending insatiable quest of power for The Party all manifest themselves in a most uncanny manner as the very traits of Stalin's totalitarian Mother Russia.  In summation, Darkness at Noon is as equally short as it is morose yet germane -- in short, a veritable je ne sais qoui.<br />&quot;As he raised his head, his gaze fell on the portrait of No. 1 hanging on the wall, and once again he recognized the expression of knowing irony with which years ago No. 1 had taken leave of him-that melancholy cynicism which stared down on humanity from the omnipresent portrait.&quot;	2004-02-21

Dan Brown's inclusion of cryptography, somebody myseriously dying on the first page, a sexy intelligent female protagonist, a college professor who becomes the reluctant hero, & a mysterious assassin in every one of his books IS bordering on a sick obsession.  That being said, his formula DOES work.  Hey, if it ain't broke, don't fix it.<br />Seeing as Digital Fortress is his inaugural work, Dan Brown makes a few rookie mistakes that unequivocally engender some implausibility throughout the book.  So as not to give away anything, I'll just say that the ostensibly intractable quagmire that the characters are engulfed in is hardly realistic, let alone believable.  Having said that, Brown's mastery of suspenseful prose more than makes up for his shortsightedness in other areas.  After all, this is why it IS fiction - not nonfiction.  I enjoyed it and recommend it to those who enjoyed The Da Vinci Code.  As a caveat, just don't expect 100% accuracy on the computer minutiae.	2004-02-13

But ladies and gents, fiction this is not.  Haney brings to the table the real deal - from learning how to highjack cars and pick locks to engaging in a grueling, gut-wrenching 40 mile hike through God's country.  The first half of the book takes place at the venerable Fort Bragg.  The initial Delta Force hopefuls that descended upon Fort Bragg were none other than the elite of the elite - NCO's from Special Forces units, Ranger units, and other elite units.  Of these elite soldiers, only 7% would be so fortunate as to call themselves operators of the original Delta Force.  Interestingly, that 7% acceptance rate of the Delta Force unit of which Eric Haney was a founding member still stands as the HIGHEST success rate in the history of Delta Force.<br />That, if nothing else, puts the unfailing and unwavering tenacity, skill, and determination of Delta Force into perspective.  Haney introduces us to Delta Force's eccentric, yet unmistakably brilliant founder, Col. Beckwith.  Haney takes us through jaw-dropping exploits in training and later through his many harrowing field assignments in Beirut, The Sudan, Grenada, & Honduras among others.  Undoubtedly, a truly fascinating and awe-inspiring book.  As Command Sergeant Major Shumate would say, \\"Have a good 'un!\\"<br />\\"We must continue to seek out and eradicate terrorist threats wherever they exist.  Delta Force will be one of the principal weapons in that fight.\\"	2004-02-13

The classroom lectures of Col. Dubois in his History and Moral Philosophy class vibrantly resonate the most sacrosanct pursuits in life, namely those of liberty & freedom, and the fact that they do not come cheaply.<br />As Dubois so incisively states, \\"Of all the so-called natural human rights that have ever been invented, liberty is least likely to be cheap and is never free of cost.\\" As the MI is constantly reminded, one must always be \\"on the bounce\\" and eternally vigilant.  Instead of Juan Rico and his MI troopers nonchalantly waiting for the Bugs to attack them, they take the fight to them.  As Col. Dubois invokes the cogent example of Carthage, he espouses, and rightfully so I might add, that no war was ever won by sitting back and waiting to be attacked; to do so is quixotic at best, suicidal at worst.  Overall, a great book that proves both entertaining & provocative - much more so than the watered-down movie.	2004-02-12

Originally labeled as The Tragedy of Richard III by Shakespeare, one can see, upon reading this enthralling play, why this history/tragedy firmly entrenched itself as one of The Bard's most prolifically performed plays with almost unrivaled longevity due to its immense popularity among the genteel and yeomen alike.<br />Although the much-maligned humpback King Richard was by no means a saint by any stretch, he was not, however, as wretchedly insidious as Shakespeare might have us believe.  In an effort to pander to Queen Elizabeth, Shakespeare cast perhaps an overly morose shadow over the House of York.  The play itself, interestingly enough, focuses not so much on the bloody ending of The War of Roses and the ascension to the throne of Henry VII(the grandfather of Elizabeth) as it does on the uncannily cunning connivances of Richard III.  Richard's dastardly deeds, the sordid means to his end of usurping the crown, know no limits as he murders any and all who dare get in his way - and even those that don't(I suppose they're guilty by association).<br />Inextricably, although I by no means empathize with him even remotely, Richard somehow, despite his inordinately decadent reprobate ploys, coupled with his twisted soliloquies pleading to the audience his hopeless case, make him one entirely enigmatic, yet entirely captivating, antagonist that makes this play enticingly enjoyable -- in a most devilish kind of way.<br />\\"O coward conscience, how dost thou afflict me!\\"	2004-02-10

To say that Deception Point is as ingeniously crafted as The Da Vinci Code would be fallacious.  However, that being said, to say that it is a letdown would also be erroneous.  Although I found Angels &amp; Demons and The Da Vinci Code to be of a superior writing quality, Deception Point is no slouch by any means.  Deception Point, albeit a singularly unique effort from his other works in being a political/scientific thriller, equally engrosses the reader just the same with Dan Brown's customary edge of your seat thrill-ride waiting to happen type of writing style.<br />Perhaps two minor peccadilloes with Deception Point would be the incessantly bumbling idiocy of the (supposedly elite but I can't tell by reading this book)Delta Force and the fact that President Herney sends an adviser to debate his Presidential candidate.  Although there also exist many hyperboles to boot, Deception Point is, for all intents and purposes, a suspenseful page-turner that practically reads itself; it will, without a doubt, prove seemingly impossible to put down for anyone who enjoyed The Da Vinci Code.	2004-02-06

How many times have we heard this phrase attributed to such rogue countries as Iraq, Iran, Libya, Syria, &amp; The Sudan? Well, as an irrefutable addendum, one would be remissed so as not to add Saudi Arabia - and, sans doute, to the top of this list, a most dubious distinction to be sure.  Robert Baer, due to his 21 years in undercover ops for the CIA primarily in The Middle East, possesses the savoir faire of how to obtain seemingly impossible information that is revealed in this book.  Although none of it seems to knock your socks off, it does, however, shock and awe at times.<br />The increasingly alarming volatility in the already imminently combustible region, coupled with the chaotic rule(or lack thereof) of Saudi Arabia, makes for a veritable catastophic calamity just waiting to ingnite.  Saudi Arabia, as well-documented by Baer, is nothing short of a schizophrenic little child trying to keep both the U.S. and thug terrorist groups such as Al Qaeda happy - presenting a diametrically opposite persona(with money &amp; oil being the common denominators, of course)to each, and equally scared of each's potential reproach and the ensuing repercussions.<br />What will happen in Saudi Arabia? Only time will tell.  However, one man can serve two masters for only so long before one becomes jealous.	2004-02-03

His simplistic, yet profound prose proves to be a paradox in and of itself.  While the sheer simplicity of his laconic dialogue may disappoint those hoping for some intensely complex and bombastic verbiage, it does, however, impress those among us who can appreciate the genius expressly confined in such brevity.  What his often maligned simplicity lacks in its..well...complexity, Hemingway more than makes up for in his customary singular proclivity for superlative dialogue.  Hemingway, in effect, revolutionized the art of dialogue in American literature - and, after reading A Farewell to Arms, it's easy to see why.<br />A Farewell to Arms emanates forth the perplexing and provocative dualities of war and peace, true love and sex, hope and despair, & idealism and cynicism - to name a few.  Tenente(as I prefer to call him over Frederick) is, of course, a rough transference of Hemingway himself onto paper.  One can, without a doubt, see a lot of Hemingway's characteristic brusque gruffness in the protagonist throughout the novel.  Tenente undergoes a stark and rather pronounced transformation, or epiphany if you will, that undoubtedly makes A Farewell to Arms one of the truly memorable works of the 20th Century.<br />Although I wanted to throw the book against the wall after the tragic ending, I nonetheless refuse to denounce Hemingway's undeniable greatness as witnessed in A Farewell to Arms.	2004-01-29

It masterfully transforms the passive history of mere names, dates, places, and seemingly foregone conclusions into a vibrant and exciting brand of living history.  Having met Newt Gingrich at a book signing in Atlanta for Gettysburg and listened to a brief dissertation on the subject matter, his vision of active history IS indeed plausible and nothing short of engrossing.<br />Having enjoyed The Killer Angels and Gods and Generals, it was refreshing to be introduced to intriguing military commanders of the Army of the Potomac OTHER than Joshua Chamberlain such as Brigadier General Henry Hunt, Commander of U.S. Artillery, General Hermann Haupt, Commander of U.S. Military Railroads, & who could forget the brazenly impetuous, if not foolishly cavalier \\"hero\\" of Gettysburg - General Dan Sickles, Commmander of the III Corps.  The authors bring this eclectic bunch of leaders of The Army of the Potomac, along with arguably their best leader in Winfield Scott Hancock and the hopelessly incapable George Meade, to life in a most skillful writing style.<br />As for the CSA, Gingrich hits the nail on the head when he writes from Robert E. Lee's perspective: \\"I have four men who are supposed to be my direct instrument of command.  One is still trying to find his way after losing a leg, the second is sick, the third is bullheaded and not fully committed to this operation, and the fourth, well the fourth has simply disappeared.\\"  It is with this perplexing scenario that we are thrust into Lee's quandary of being, for the first time, not oly in the enemy's land, but also without any truly dynamic leaders under his command.  This, invariably, is where the stale world of passive history ends and the vibrantly unpredictable world of active history begins.  Enjoy.<br />\\"Convince your men that they can win.

The quaint small town setting of Messina makes for an ideal backdrop for a Southern high school football town - one where football is God.  If you don't like football, too bad.  People reviewing this book from outside of the South slamming it unmercifully either hate sports or simply do not understand the full significance of football in the South; high school football in the South is just as important, if not more so, than church on Sunday.  It is, in no uncertain terms, a religion unto itself that is talked about year round - not just in the Fall.<br />Having said that, I found the story of Neely Crenshaw, Silo, et al to be amusing as well as mildly profound at times.  Everybody has known a Coach Rake along the way - somebody that has molded you into who you are today that you hated for doing it at the time.

What makes America great? Chris Matthews tells us.  From the infinitely sagacious leadership of George Washington to the tantalizing, yet almost palpable, American dream symbolized by Jay Gatsby to the idealistic moral indignation of Jefferson Smith, Matthews smoothly runs the gamut of the great American landscape.  Matthews exalts such seemingly common men as Andrew Jackson, Abraham Lincoln, and Harry Truman who exhibited, in what was no accident, truly uncommon leadership.<br />Lincoln was said to have rebuked those who complained of Grant's heavy alcohol consumption.  Find out what he drinks and give it to the other generals, the president told them.  &quot;I can't spare this man.  He fights.&quot;<br />Truman, sworn in to office as Vice President just 3 months prior to assuming the Presidency, was, as Matthews states, &quot;a regular fellow who just as easily could be standing behind the counter when you went to buy a new pair of socks,&quot; became an extraordinary leader in a time of extraordinary crisis.  Truman, along with Lincoln, had the guts to do what he thought was right.  In using the atom bomb to end WWII Truman, in effect, avoided a million American casualties in an ensuing invasion.  The result was a dismal 23% approval rating when he left office.  As Matthews so aptly states, &quot;Tough decisions don't always make friends.&quot;  History, however, would be a better judge; Truman now is rightfully revered as one of the greatest Presidents of the 20th century.  Matthews, being intellectually honest, honors the maverick leadership of John McCain and the eternal optimism of Ronald Reagan as well.

Oliver North provides an - get this - honest account of what REALLY transpired during Operation Iraqi Freedom.<br />In an impromptu interview with two grunts of the 4th ID, North, in an attempt to ascertain the truth and to dispel the unfounded rumors of an ill-prepared and ill-equipped US military, asked the soldiers: &quot;The New York Times says the Marines are out of food, water, and ammo.

Peter Robinson, speechwriter for VP Bush and later for President Reagan, recounts this story along with many other amusing and inspiring anecdotes of his Reagan years.

Of Baker, Robinson recorded in his journal in 1983, &quot;As far as I'm concerned, the list of adjectives that applies to the pragmatist reads like the entry in Roget's Thesaurus under the heading for 'jerk.'&quot;<br />Robinson tells of the amusingly pointed speech written by his buddy Josh Gilder that, for all intents and purposes, quashed the Democrats' bid for raising taxes:  &quot;'My veto pen is drawn and ready, and I have only one thing to say to the tax increasers.'  Reagan paused for a full, rounded beat, his eyes alight with pleasure.  'Go ahead.  Make my day.'  A couple of hours later, the effort to raise taxes collapsed.

I was not quite sure as to what exact dynamic to expect when undertaking Cold Mountain.  Cold Mountain is by no means a war book.  Nor is it, however, a romance novel - by any stretch.  It is, as most great works are, difficult to categorize.  Due to its unique writing style it, invariably, breaks the mold of your typical war or love drama genre.  For those Civil War buffs looking for bloody detail into the battle of Fredricksburg or insight into the life of a soldier, look elsewhere.  For those looking for love and romance, look elsewhwere as well.<br />For those, however, looking for an extraordinarily well-crafted work of ingenuity and originality, look here.  The book, while slow developing, gathers intrigue &amp; momentum as it progresses through the weaving and meandering tale of Cold Mountain residents Ada, Inman, Ruby, and their many encounters with a rather eclectic, if not downtrodden, group of individuals.  Although morose and macabre at times with its themes of death and despondency in the present interspersed with hopeful peace and love on the horizon, Cold Mountain remains profound and luminous throughout - not unlike the central characters.<br />Fittingly, while the South is on the proverbial cusp of the most vastly transformational epoch in its history, Ada, Inman, and Ruby undergo similarly arduous travails while overcoming immeasurable adversity - in what amounts to their very own transformation - each one singular in its own regard.  Cold Mountain, much like Ada, Inman, &amp; Ruby, proves itself a true profile in courage, resilience, and perseverance.<br />&quot;To Ada, though, it seemed akin to miracle that Stobrod, of all people, should offer himself up as proof positive that no matter what a waste one has made of one's life, it is ever possible to find some path to redemption, however partial.&quot;	2003-12-31

Or better yet, Peter Jennings, far and away the most negative liberal anchor, described the many joyous Iraqi celebrants as a &quot;small crowd.&quot;  Peter, who had no qualms of grossly overstating the number of looters, had no compunction whatsoever about marginalizing the joy of an oppressed people liberated after years of despotic rule.  Peter, who gave prominent airtime to a woman holding a sign that read &quot;KILL Bush, Blair, Rumsfeld and Powell NOT INNOCENT IRAQI CIVILIANS,&quot; somehow found it distasteful to air a rally in support of our troops just one day earlier.  It turns out the woman was in, of all places, Nairobi, Kenya while the support our troops rally was in New York City - just miles away from Peter's plush network studio.  ABC, incidentally, was the only network not to give it airtime.  And the beat goes on.<br />The irony of the liberal media, as Goldberg astutely points out, is their unwillingness to be open to diverse points of view.  In their insular Ivy League world surrounded with only like-minded liberals, they are never exposed to divergent points of view.  Hence, their myopic liberal views are never challenged.<br />As Goldberg states, &quot;It seems to me that liberals - the very people who take pride in seeing themselves as civil and open-minded - have, in a sad kind of way, become precisely what they accuse conservatives of: being close-minded and nasty.&quot;  When you live in a bubble and surround yourself with only people who think likewise, that is, invariably, what happens.  Arrogance entertains, shocks, and educates.  A book that everyone should read - liberals especially.	2003-12-20

It is a most touching, albeit somewhat disturbing, memoir that everyone should read in order to fully grasp the horrific nature of the diabolical crimes perpetuated against humanity  by the Nazis in Warsaw.  It is at times shocking, at times unnerving, at times depressing, and, at times uplifting.<br />The unshakable perseverence, resilience, and sheer will of survival emanate from Wladyslaw Szpilman throughout this disturbing memoir.  The uspurpassed evil of the Gestapo and the perfidy of the traitorous Jewish Police prove to be most sickening.  The arbitrary murdering of the Jewish population via genocide in the Warsaw ghetto sadly is only emblematic of Poland itself.  The Jewish population in Poland before the war was 3.5 million.  Afterwards, it was a mere 400,000.  The evil that resides in the dark recesses of human nature that was emboldened to new levels by Hitler and his sordid agenda, as Captain Hosenfeld poignantly describes in his diary after the text, must never again be allowed to resurface.<br />This book, although simplistic at times, could not have been more profound.  It will, as it has done to me, leave an indelible reminder of the unremitting human spirit of Wladyslaw Szpilman and his arduous, if not unbelievable, triumph of over evil - against ridiculously impossible odds.	2003-12-19

Will they? Of course not.  And if they did, they would merely scoff at the Zell Miller prescription for their malady of histrionics and rampant liberalism.<br />Zell Miller, to his credit, possesses a most laudable nobility that is rarely seen in Washington.  Miller, unlike virtually all politicians, is a man who speaks, and more importantly, votes, his conscience.  Miller served admirably as Governor here in Georgia as he fulfilled his campaign objectives of tax cuts for economic growth, the seminal HOPE scholarship, a Pre-K program, the only 2 strikes law for violent offenders in the nation, as well as more than tripling the amount of land set aside for state parks in the beautiful state of Georgia.<br />Miller, as he writes in this eye-opening treatise, explains how it is not he who has changed - but rather the Democratic Party itself.  Miller, who listened to FDR's inspiring fireside chats with his mother as a youngster and sided with JFK's message of a strong national defense and lower taxes, has always voted Democrat and has always believed in good, old-fashioned family values - the same values the current Democrats shun like the plague.<br />The Democrats, so irrevocably beholden to unscrupulous PACs and their extreme left wing agenda, don't have a clue as to the depths of the chasm of venality into which they have sunk.  They have fallen so far out of mainstream America it would take a search party to find them.  Miller, never one to mince words, says of Howard Dean: &quot;He likes to say he belongs to the Democratic wing of the Democratic Party, but I say he belongs to the whining wing of the Democratic Party.  Angry and red-faced, these doom-and-gloomers need to take some 'calm-me-down' pills.&quot;<br />2004 is all but won for President Bush.  Once again, just as in 2000, the Democrats will fail in their futile attempt to win even one Southern state.	2003-12-18

This eclectic mix, no matter how bizarre it may seem, makes for an incredibly engrossing novel that is seemingly impossible to put down.  Mystic River explores the depths of the human psyche quite unlike any other mystery novel of late.  The sometimes endearing, sometimes revolting characters are ingeniously crafted by Dennis Lehane.  While you feel as if you know them and their tendencies, their mercurial impetuosity and guileful machinations will keep you guessing until the end.<br />How far would you go to avenge a wrong? Would you keep a secret of dastardly proportions to protect your spouse or loved one? What is more important: one's conscience or one's loyalty? Can you truly right a wrong by a wrong? Mystic River provokes these and other profound quandaries.  Lehane, sans facade,  ensconces the reader within the spellbinding story and its prodigiously enigmatic characters.  Mystic River, while it may be dark and disturbing at times, nevertheless maintains an amazing level of intensity throughout its entirety that makes it, without doubt, a truly great read.	2003-12-16

Due to this undeniably rare combination in modern fiction, Wolfe elevates himself above the 2 books/year modern authors who churn out books like a factory and value spineless &amp; flavorless style over certifiable substance.  Wolfe, in A Man in Full, gives us a work not lacking in either comprehensiveness or profundity.  This, like Bonfire, is a great American novel.<br />Wolfe's refreshing penchant for amazingly lucid and superlatively amusing dialogue makes this book hard to put down.  Wolfe ingeniously satirizes the unwritten, although readily apparent, class structure of the South through such bizarrely eclectic characters as Charlie Croker(good ol' boy establishment), his ex-wife Martha(shallow elitist), Fareek &quot;The Canon&quot; Fanon(flatulent inner-city star athlete), Croker's wife Serena(trophy wife), Roger &quot;too&quot; White II(the Morehouse Man in an identity crisis), Conrad Hensley(blue collar drone turned philosopher), and my favorite character, the entertainingly enigmatic Raymond Peepgass(the East Coast crowd moved South).<br />A Man in Full comes highly recommended to those who value witty, substantive works over vapidly trite novels of fluff.<br />It's only fitting to conclude with an excerpt of typical Wolfe dialogue from the jail scene:<br />&quot;But how do you get to be a...player?&quot; Conrad asked Five-O. &quot;What can you do?&quot;<br />&quot;No do no mo'notting, brah.

Everyone's talking about it - and for good reason.  In what is rare in modern fiction, it combines the rare duality of highly suspenseful entertainment along with provocative historical insight.  The intriguing settings of Paris and London make for an ideal backdrop for this well-crafted tale(it is fiction people) that you can't put down.  This is one of those rare books that will keep you up at night reading - as opposed to serving as a cure for insomnia.<br />Si vous pouvez parler francais, c'est tres utile pour ce livre.  If you can't(speak French, that is), then a French-English dictionary would be of use when reading The Da Vinci Code, which, at times, uses French without translation.  The characters are well designed, yet mysterious - which lends itself to the making of a great mystery.  Not only are you trying to figure out the identity of the murderer(it happens on page 1 so I'm not giving anything away here), you also find yourself deeply ensconced in the quest for the historical truth of, among other things, Mary Magdalene, Jesus, Da Vinci, The Holy Grail, Opus Dei, The Vatican, and most inscrutably, The Priory of Sion.  While this is fiction, it will invariably raise some eyebrows in any circle.  Read it yourself and be your own judge.	2003-12-12

Dinesh D'Souza, having been a Senior Domestic Policy Advisor for the latter part of the Reagan presidency, gives us unique and unadulterated(unlike The Reagans movie) insights into events that DID happen and things that Reagan DID say.<br />This is not, by any means, a blind ode to Reagan.  It shares plenty of Reagan speaking gaffes as well as his distant relationship with his children.  That being said, D'Souza does not go so far as to demonize Reagan as liberals invariably do.  Reagan is vastly underrated as a leader - and Dinesh cites many examples how.  Reagan's &quot;rendezvous with destiny&quot; and his bold, clear, &amp; unwavering vision of democracy and freedom put America back on the map as THE world superpower after the chaotic tumult that ensued under the ambiguous indecisiveness of Jimmy Carter.<br />Reagan took the bad hand that he was dealt of stagflation, an impotent military, rising unemployment, outrageous gas prices, exorbitant mortgages of 21%, disgustingly high taxes, &amp; a permeating sense of festering malaise and, undeterred, set into action his campaign pledges: restoring economic growth through tax cuts, curbing of monstrous inflation, ending the gasoline crisis, sparking technological progress, defeating commununism, rebuilding an outmoded and ineffective military, and most importantly, restoring the optimism, patriotism and pride of Americans in this great country.  It is impossible to lead if you are unsure of where you want to go.  Reagan, it goes without saying, did not have this problem.<br />&quot;My optimism comes not just from my strong faith in God but from my strong and enduring faith in man.&quot;	2003-12-12

Candide, albeit a short work, emanates incredible power.  When first printed, Candide subsequently was banned by Louis XV for fear of rousing the proletariat.  Upon reading Candide, one can, without doubt, ascertain why.  Voltaire stresses resilience, realism, and an eschewal of blithe trust and optimism.<br />For a short work, Candide provides more outrageously absurd events than one would deem possible.  Voltaire's unremitting penchant for humorous and farcical satire makes this book an absolute necessity to read for anyone who possesses a keen mind and is up to the challenge of profound literature.	2003-12-11

Although some liberal reviewers have made mention to the contrary, this book is no 'fluff' account intended to pander to the Bushes.  It is, for all intents and purposes, a look into the trying times of 9/11, the blunders of Bush's exceedingly chronicled youth, the meeting of the two, as well as the incredible adversity overcome by both.<br />While reading this, at times I would feel that this was a malicious attack on the Bushes, but all in all, it was relatively evenhanded as it revealed both good and bad accounts of their lives.  I was unaware of Laura's vehicular manslaughter incident as well as her near death experience while delivering the twins.  Other than that, this book provides few insights into their lives.  In summation, I deem it worth a checkout from the library, but hardly worth a purchase.	2003-12-09

From being a child piano prodigy to entering the University of Denver at age 15, to becoming the youngest Provost ever at Stanford, to becoming the first female National Security Advisor ever, Condi has not only met, but conquered all incoming challenges.  Through the adversity of war and liberal critics, she has maintained her customary charm, intelligence, mental fortitude, and the ability to hold her own with anyone.<br />This book provides a brief, yet somewhat lacking, look into the maturation of Condoleezza Rice from a piano prodigy to that of a Russian virtuoso and superb foreign relations advisor.  From a young age, her parents instilled in her values that she not only talks about, but lives by, in her life today; such values as self responsibility, equality and freedom for all, unwavering adherence to one's moral principles of right and wrong, a strong faith in God, and of course, a tireless work ethic that is to be lauded, if not emulated, by all.  Dr. Rice is, without question, the most powerful woman in America.  She has been intrumental in the unification of Germany under Bush 41, has been indispensable in her meetings with Vladimir Putin, has been resolute and positive during times of adversity, and has maintained her belief in the ideals and principles on which America was founded.<br />With her background and abilities, she no doubt has a bright future  - possibly as Secretary of State, VP, Senator, or maybe even President.  This book, despite its quasi-adequate background of Dr. Rice, provides little of her exploits as NSA.  Overall, a good and insightful read about a fascinating individual - albeit without much substance.	2003-11-26

Posner reveals new information indicting the complicity of the Saudi monarchy as well as subsequent highly bizarre Saudi deaths of those in the know about 9/11.  Posner, in what amounts to not much of a shocker, exposes the duplicity of Germany and their covering up for an Al-Queda informant.<br />Without a doubt, the single biggest reason &quot;why America slept&quot; is none other than Bill Clinton and his blithe apathy and nonchalance for our all things national security.  Posner recounts Clinton's well-documented inexcusable failure to capture Osama Bin Laden when given multiple opportunities to do so.  After the Khobar Towers bombing, the first World Trade Center bombing, the USS Cole bombing, &amp; the bombing of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, Clinton's idea of fighting terrorism was nothing more than sending cruise missiles to destroy an aspirin factory in Nigeria and blowing up a deserted, yet somehow threatening, Al-Queda tent in Afghanistan.  If Clinton had exhibited at least some semblance of a clue as to what was going on, 9/11 could have, and would have, been prevented.	2003-11-21

Bush	Books	4	4	6	N	N	Illuminating look behind the scenes	To anyone interested in the inner workings of highly intense election campaigns, the press, or George W. Bush, then I highly recommend you take a look-see at this book.  Frank Bruni, a fair and intelligent writer of the New York Times(a paradox of sorts), recounts his insightful, sometimes bizarre, ecnounters while being assigned to cover the Bush campaign for the duration of the 2000 campaign.<br />Bruni makes this book worth reading alone for the many humorous and revealing anecdotes that unveil the lighthearted candor of George W. Bush and his entertaining give-and-take with the press while traveling aboard his campaign plane.<br />When speaking of Al Gore, Bruni writes, &quot;He(Bush) made it clear that he saw Gore as equal parts pompous blowhard and preening chameleon, a spineless panderer ready to be anything for anyone.  For Bush, this was distilled in a single, oddly chosen detail: 'The man dyes his hair.'&quot;  Nuff said.	2003-11-19

Harris incessantly endured countless malicious personal attacks, disparaging caricatures of her persona, specious accusations of impropriety, erroneous insinuations of her being a lackey of the Bush team - all of which, indubitably, turned out to be fallacious lies.  Through this trying experience of being a human pinata engulfed in the \\"center of the storm,\\" Harris admirably exhibited principled leadership, unwavering tenacity, mental fortitude, & irreproachable integrity.<br />While the book's title is somewhat of a misnomer considering it is, for all intents and purposes, a leadership book, Harris nonetheless does reveal some intriguing information about the 2000 election.  Not the least of which is Al Gore personally instructing his staff to initiate a vicious smear campaign to impugn the integrity of Katherine Harris during the arduous recount process.  Instead of being broken or bitter, Mrs. Harris, to her credit, chose to be better.  Among the more salient leadership qualities discussed in the book are: To know what you believe, Stick to your guns, Do what is right-and the future will take care of itself, Resist the tyranny of the urgent, Feed your mind, Finish what you start, Act & risk enmity; To remain popular do nothing.<br />By knowing what she believed in from the beginning, sticking to her guns, and doing what was right, Mrs. Harris not only performed admirably, but also set the stage for a bright political future.  The formidable leadership values(each chapter discusses a new leadership value), combined with a wonderful bevy of quotations, make this a leadership book that you will find both enjoyable and edifying.	2003-11-10

Too many times in both college and in business we hear of two types of coaches and managers - the overly soft players coach or the motivate by fear authoritarian type.  Seldom have we seen a coach succeed at such a high level who, through a tireless work ethic, has engendered such indelible values as trust, personal responsibility, honesty, teamwork, the ability to laugh at one's mistakes, selflessness, &amp; a genuine love for those on your team as if they were your family.<br />This is, as opposed to a memoir, a leadership book - one that everyone who has followed Duke would enjoy and learn from.  Coach K reveals his secrets to motivating players, his core values, how to deal with adversity, how to maintain a level of excellence, &amp; what it takes to get to the top - in sports, business, and in life.  Coach K chronicles humorous and educational anecdotal stories with his players such as Chris Collins, Christian Laettner, Bobby Hurley, Grant Hill, Elton Brand, Jeff Capel, Danny Ferry, Trajan Langdon, Wojo, Johnny Dawkins, &amp; Shane Battier to name a few that helped mold them into not only great players on the court, but more importantly, great leaders off of the court.

Bill Gertz effectively dissects and examines the failure of our government to prevent the horrific events of 9/11 in a well-written effort that exposes the many deficiencies that ultimately led to that ignominious failure.  Paramount among them, Gertz says, are &quot;a system hamstrung by bad politics, poor leadership, and bureaucratic ineptitude.&quot;<br />Gertz also points out the most glaring problem at hand: a flagrant lack of accountability - especially within the CIA.  Gertz tells how Langley was notified of an impending Al Qaeda attack, and, of course, made no precautions whatsoever.  Clinton holdover Tenet dropped the ball(as he has many times since), and he must pay the price.  Consequences and repercussions must be meted out.  Accountability must be respected.  Tenet still arrogantly proclaims that his intelligence gathering ability, the same intelligence that has since proved faulty in Iraq, is sound and beyond reproach.  Mr. Tenet, there's the door.

I read a few pages, and due in large part to curiosity, had to check it out.  First off, I would never vote for Al Sharpton due to his far left politics.  That being said, I respect him nonetheless for the passion and enthusiasm he brings to the table.  Let's face it, he's the only Dem candidate with even an ounce of genuineness and passion.  He's the only reason to watch the debates.<br />I admire the Reverend for doing things he discusses in the book such as sticking his neck on the line and getting thrown in jail while in Vieques to protest the naval bombings, which has led to cancer and other health problems among its inhabitants.  However, I must call in to question the legitimacy of Mr. Sharpton being \\"a man of God\\" when he states things such as the following in his book: \\"My religion does not support homosexuality, but I do.\\" & \\"I will not stand in the way of a woman's right to choose.\\" & \\"Sexual orientation in no way matters when it comes to parenting-all children need is love.\\"<br />Read the book and be your own judge.

Just mentioning those two words evokes emotion from those who follow politics - be it a scowl from a liberal, or hopefully, a smile and an affirmative nod of the head from one of a more keen intellect.  It seems as if Rummy has created, in what is indicative of any true leader, many friends - as well as some enemies - along his way.  The Rumsfeld Way is, for all intents and purposes, a leadership book, albeit one that also chronicles Rumsfeld's highly successful exploits both in the private sector and the public arena as it delineates Rummy's dynamic leadership acumen.<br />Rumsfeld has, in what is no small feat, rapidly transformed America's national defense from a vacillating and timid gun shy state of malaise with a dilapidated and impotent military suffering from Clinton-induced low morale to the current state of a vibrant, robust, confident, and fully empowered military unrivaled in the world.  How has he, for someone the liberals gleefully lambasted as being a relic of another era, generated such impressive results in such a short amount of time, all the while accumulating an impressively fervent following? One reason is Rummy, who routinely works grueling 14-hour days at The Pentagon, expects nothing but excellence from all of those around him - including himself.  Tolerating underperformers, and God forbid, nonperformers, doesn't fly in the Rumsfeld camp - to put it mildly.  Rummy's 2-word leadership mantra of &quot;Get Results,&quot; while simply stated, sums up his no-nonsense philosophy.  Invariably, he has achieved exemplary results, while cultivating, unlike the Clinton White House, such wildly bizarre concepts as honesty(gasp!), integrity, perseverance, propriety, and plain old-fashioned straight talk - all the while invoking a cutting sense of humor.<br />When you're a multi-millionaire of retirement age, why return to the arduous undertaking of heading up the Pentagon? Because Rumsfeld, being the leader that he is, thrives on seemingly intractable challenges.  As a country and a people, we are blessed to have had Rumsfeld return to Washington in the period just prior to such an incredibly grave and trying time in our American history. This book is a must read for anyone who wants to truly enrich themselves with the intricacies of what consitutes a truly superb paragon of leadership - from a man that all Americans should be thankful is working for them.<br />&quot;Some people believe that the first casualty of any war is the truth.  But in this war, the first victory is to tell the truth.&quot;<br />- Donald Rumsfeld	2003-11-01

That being said, Albom's 2nd offering can neither compare, nor supplement, Morrie.  So, please, do yourself a big favor and do not go into this one thinking it will be on the same level of profundity.  It's not.<br />Having issued my caveat, allow me to say now that this short, yet poignant, novella, makes for a most enjoyable and thought-provoking read.  Do you tell your loved ones how much they really mean to you? Do you possess a genuine love of mankind or are you corrupted by the increasingly pervasive cynicism that unfortunately seems to be the order of the day?

But, thanks to the genius, or glaring deficiency thereof, of our 42nd President, we were sucked into our current dilemma of fighting terrorism with one hand tied behind our backs.

US	39366896	R39ZXF3ZG0UM7M	0684807610	438783610	Benjamin Franklin: An American Life	Books	5	1	3	N	N	Transcendent life lessons of lasting resonance	To many, Benjamin Franklin represents to them a man who is venerable, yet aloof; hearty, yet frugal; inventive, yet practical; compromising, yet rigid; bourgeois, yet elitist; industrious, yet leisurely; moralistic, yet far from Puritan; &amp; affectionate, yet inscrutably emotionally detached from his own family.  And to many more, he simply is the prosaic caricature of an unassuming old man in round spectacles flying a kite in the rain and magically summoning lightning from the sky.  While the persona of Benjamin Franklin has been made to be many things by many people in the many years since his death in 1790 at the age of 84, it is neither, however, fair, nor accurate, to pigeonhole him into any one confining mold or category.  That would be committing a most grievous affront to Franklin, as well as to the annals of history.  Moreover, it would make you out to be an inanely foolish knave.<br />What Walter Isaacson has accomplished is no small minor miracle.  He has written a biography that allows you, the mere reader, to not only understand, but to live, Franklin's life as it plays out in the text, interestingly whose type font itself was championed by Franklin and used for the first printing of The Declaration of Independence.  Indubitably, Franklin's popularity has risen and waned just as the prevailing moods of divergent epochs have arbitrarily shifted.  While haughty Romanticists such as D.H. Lawrence overtly deplored Franklin, the middle class of America has revered his example and looked to him for his timeless sage advice during times of duress and volatility, such as The Gilded Age and The Great Depression.  Isaacson candidly reveals all aspects of Franklin's extraordinary life from his momentous swaying of the French to join the struggling colonies in The Revloutionary War to such seemingly mundane, yet stangely provocative occurrences such as him getting caught kissing the daughter of his English landlord, who just happened to be 33 years his junior.<br/>Franklin, as many historians contend, was truly the first ever self-made man of The New World.  Franklin created, and truly came to symbolize, the first ever group of &quot;middling&quot; class that would lay the foundation of our great country, a country that Franklin vowed to give everyone an opportunity, irrespective of heritage and birth, as well as explicitly devoid of elitist pretensions.  This fledgling group of &quot;leather-aprons&quot; should adhere, said Franklin, to such virtues as religious tolerance, humility, respect of others, faith in the virtues of hard work and frugality, benevolent belief in voluntary efforts to help others, &amp; resentment to unnecessary luxury, hereditary privileges.  Seeing as my meager review will hardly do this infinitely intriguing and masterfully written book justice, you absolutely must read this incredible journey through the prodigiously captivating life of the man who, given the incomprehensible breadth of his achievements, I consider to be the most underrated figure in American history.<br />&quot;Search others for their virtues, thyself for thy vices.&quot;<br />- Poor Richard(aka Benjamin Franklin)	2003-10-26

First off, allow me to commend Colmes on his admirable ability(unlike fellow liberal zealots) to elevate the level of discourse and present his case(even though it's wrong) with a degree of professionalism and decorum that is conspicuously absent with the cretin likes of Al Franken, Michael Moore, and the 9 Dwarves.  That being said, I found this book to be a farce of a political effort.  When I tried to play devil's advocate and attempt to be persuaded to his side, I found my attempt to be nonsensical, if not impossible.<br />His chapter titles, although admittedly themselves a vain attempt to push buttons, are enough to make anyone with half of a brain go into a veritable apoplexy: OJ Is Innocent, Jesus Was a Liberal, and, the icing on this not so delicious cake, Clinton, Our Greatest President.  Colmes quotes emails from radical zealots and attempts to indocrinate his readers that these people(all of whom somehow misspell routine words)are indicative of all conservatives.  Colmes, this is not only gross misrepresentation of conservatism, it is nothing short of malicious demagoguery.	2003-10-23

If you call yourself a tennis enthusiast, suffice to say you're not one in my book if you haven't read You Cannot Be Serious.  The always irreverent Johnny Mac takes the reader behind the scenes of his meteoric and sudden rise to the top of the tennis world as a teenager as well as his difficult, if not tumultuous, ride down when he was married to Tatum O'Neal.  McEnroe recounts many amusing anecdotes from his tennis days that make for an entertaining read.  He tells the stories behing his not so secret disdain for the enigmatic Jimmy Connors(beginning with Connors' refusal to shake his hand prior to their first Wimbledon meeting in 1977 when McEnroe was an 18 year-old unseeded juniors player).<br />McEnroe reveals his propensity for smoking marijuana during his self-imposed hiatus from tennis in the mid 80's, the wild partying with the amiable Vitas Gerulaitis, the mutual camaraderie, unparalleled competition, and respect, of his nemesis and friend Bjorn Borg, the infamous longstanding feud with Connors, and his passion for, and unprecedented success, with Davis Cup.  Johnny Mac tells of an offer of $1 Million from Donald Trump to play Venus that Venus turned down based on the somewhat dubious claim that she didn't want to play &quot;an old man.&quot;  McEnroe, ever the competitor, tells of his anger over Steffi's notorious default of their Wimbledon mixed doubles semi that left him calling her a rather choice name(female dog is a hint) in the locker room - strangely enough in the company of her future hubby Andre Agassi and his then coach Brad Gilbert.  Good stuff.	2003-10-20

Bush growing up as a Willie Mays baseball fan and Little League catcher in Texas, going off to Andover &amp; Yale, serving in The Texas Air National Guard, falling in love with an unassuming librarian named Laura, being blessed with the unexpected announcement of twins, owning The Texas Rangers, unseating Ann Richards as Texas Governor, and ultimately becoming the Republican Presidential Candidate in 2000.<br />George W. Bush, unlike the Democrats running in 2004 spewing forth name-calling invective, definitively delineates his substantive beliefs in the book.  He masterfully elucidates the virtues of being a conservative: &quot;I am a conservative because I believe in the work and dignity and power of each individual.  My philosophy trusts individuals to make the right decisions for their families and communities, and that is far more compassionate than a philosophy that seeks solutions from distant bureaucracies.&quot;  Bush extolls his strong belief in a limited government that encourages innovation and competition, low taxes, a strong national defense, locally-controlled education with an emphasis on reading and accountability for failure, a support of free markets and free trade, personal responsibility, bipartisanship teamwork, and the adherence to irreproachable personal standards of integrity, honor, and decency while in public service.  Bush, unlike his predecessor, has done a remarkable job of achieving an impressive benchmark of ethical decorum as he has rightfully returning respect and dignity to the Clinton-tainted White House.<br />Bush, in his trademark self-effacing humor, tells of how when he was owner of The Texas Rangers and a fan kept heckling him with, among other caveats, &quot;Hey, Bush, more pitching!&quot; for almost the entire game.  Bush subsequently invited him down to his field level seats and asked him whether he liked having his name yelled out loud in public in a derogatory way.  After the man, who was a teacher, indicated that he did not, Bush replied, &quot;Neither do I.&quot;  They went on to have a great baseball discussion.  Several years later when he became Governor, a man tapped one of his security officers on the shoulder and said he needed to see him.  The man, he said, was one of the Governor's &quot;ballpark friends.&quot;<br />&quot;The fearful build walls.  The confident tear them down.&quot;<br />-George W. Bush	2003-10-11

Palahniuk brings to the table his customary and singular writing style that is unlike any other writer out there today.  In Diary, similar to his other works, Palahniuk recounts the lives of morally depraved individuals who attempt to let fate manage their lives.<br />The ominous setting of Diary, Waytansea Island, conveniently serves as a metaphor for their apathetic and pathetic nihilistic existence.

Boortz lays out, interspersed with humor, a concise and structured argument debunking the emotion-based logic(or lack thereof) of the brainless liberal populace.  Boortz tells how he made the transition from a delivery man doing heavy lifting to doing talk radio in Atlanta after a DJ killed himself and a position became conspicuously vacant.

When reading a book from a previous time period, one might begin to ponder that very legitimate concern? It is, but it isn't.  Allow me to elucidate.  Bonfire garners irrepressible staying power as a scathing, sardonic, and witty treatise exposing the greed, glamour, decadence, and moral decay of the 80's not unlike The Roaring 20's of Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby.  By no means is Bonfire in the same boat as Gatsby, but nonetheless, it's in the same ballpark, if you will.<br />Having never read Tom Wolfe before, I must say that I came away quite impressed and entertained by his singular ability to instantaneously transfer from one character's perspective to another at the drop of a dime(e.g. going from Reverend Bacon in the decrepit racially-charged milieu of The Bronx to Sherman McCoy in the plush comfortable confines of Park Avenue).  Wolfe's merciless satire and scathing cynicism lends itself to all of his eccentrically diverse motley cadre of characters.  As a testament to Wolfe's eclectic acumen, the author definitively nails the veritable cornucopia of targets ranging the gamut from the sheltered luxury apartments, entre nous lavish fetes of the social elite X-Rays of Park Avenue, the high-pressure environment of Sherman's Wall Street, the dog eat dog baseness of Vogel & co. at The Bronx PD and jail, the unmitigated political pandering of Weiss and Kramer at the DA's office, the Machiavellian glibness of Peter Fallow of The City Light, and, last but definitely not least, the self-serving specious \\"racial activism\\" of Reverend Bacon.<br />The vastly paradoxical upshot of it all is this my friends: Although this extraordinarily divergent melange of characters exists in strikingly unique socioeconomic environments, they all, however, undoubtedly contribute to the prodigious confluence of flagrant self-absorbtion, blatant egotism, deplorable moral degradation, pernicious greed, and the despicable venality that cryptically ties all of them together into one infinitely vacuous morally depraved vacuum categorically devoid of any semblance of moral absolutes.  Ahh...the irony of it all!  Wolfe's ingenious penchant for piquant characterization and witty dialogue makes for a smooth and fluid read that entertains as well as educates.  Bonfire IS a period piece, but it remains just as provocative today as it was upon its release.

The answer is a resounding NO. If you infantile liberal reviewers read(and I'm taking great lengths to imagine this) the book before posting sophomoric 1 star reviews, then you might know this. So, before you liberal anti-Americans go into a fever pitch, try to actually read the book - if at all possible.  Liberal elites, Ingraham states, invariably find patriotism, flag-flying, middle class Americans, churchgoing, President Bush, and of course, America - to be infinitely anathema to their vacuous lifestyles.<br />The liberal elites are, without question, the most ostentatious, insolent, morally depraved, and woefully obtuse cabal of dilettante sophists in America - a country, by the way, that they expressly loathe with such a fiery passion that would make Jacques Chirac blush.	2003-09-29

That being said, The Brothers Karamazov engenders a veritable cornucopia of raw emotions and thoughts unequaled in the world of literature.  Dostoevsky brings into question faith, justice, sin, redemption, depravity, suffering, & justice via an extraordinary confluence of pure, unbridled genius.  Unlike many other acclaimed classics, The Brothers Karamazov precipitates perpetual trenchant introspection and leaves you pondering the complex dynamics of the novel well upon completion.<br />Entering the book and have previously read Crime & Punishment and Notes From the Underground, I knew I would be in for an intense and provocative voyage into profundity - the likes of which are unique to the penmanship of Dostoevsky.  I also thought it might possibly be a bit dull and centered solely upon the brothers and their infamous tale of parricide.  Needless to say, I could not have been more erroneous in my judgment.  Case in point, I found the insidiously deceptive bastard son Smerdyakov to be without question the most intriguing and underestimated of all of the characters.<br />This morosely despairing, yet strangely effervescent tale of deceit, love, murder, and mayhem will truly be one of the best works of fiction that you will be fortunate to have read in your lifetime.

As Dean inexpectedly began to pick up steam, Bill and Hillary started to become frightened.  If the extreme leftist liberal Dean were to win the nomination, he undoubtedly would oust her yes man Terry McCauliff from power, and, in essence, the 12 year stranglehold of the Clintons on the Democratic Party.<br />As Hillary vacillates on her '04 run just as her puppet Wesley Clark vacillates on his stance on the war, the other Democrats are conveniently being thrown to the waist side as Hillary sucks up all of the oxygen of the Democratic Party with her intentionally ambivalent statements concerning her intentions in 04.  Limbacher expertly exposes the sheer hypocrisy of Hillary and her diabolical climb to the top of the food chain of the Democratic Pary - despite having few if any noteworthy accomplishments achieved along the way.

Phil Valentine pulls no punches while mercilessly debunking liberalism and its terribly flawed ideology with a veritable myriad of salient talking points.  I found this book to be a keeper and a great reference for winning oratory war with my liberal friends.<br />For starters, Valentine denounces the Carter and Clinton peace accord with North Korea for what it was - &quot;a colossal failure.&quot;  Valentine masterfully refutes the global warming paranoia for what it is - &quot;junk science.&quot; &quot;One volcanic eruption alone can spew forth more so-called greenhouse gases into the atmosphere than this country has produced in its entire history, yet Mother Nature seems to absorb them without batting an eye.&quot;<br />Valentine writes a truly deserving chapter on The Great Communicator and his triumph over communism.  Contrary to liberal popular opinion, Valentine writes, communism did not just arbitrarily &quot;find the ash heap of history.&quot;  Trust but verify and peace through strength are more than empty phrases that liberals abhor; they're powerful rallying cries and words to live by.  Valentine pillories affirmative action for what it is - quotas that discriminate by race.  Valentine states, &quot;You don't right the wrongs of the past by wronging the people of the present.&quot;  Also in Valentine's sights are the fatuous liberal cornerstones of political correctness, higher taxes, union collectivism, lax immigration standards(or lack thereof), atheism, welfare, gun banning, abortion, a weak military, and apathetic national security - just to name a few.  Valentine writes a winner that every conservative(and liberal for that matter) should read.  It may even change a liberal's inane thinking process.  Wait - I forgot.

Having had no formal Spanish training since 8th grade, I took it upon myself to learn Spanish on my own.  Learning a 2nd language may prove too daunting a task for most, but if you have the initiative and intelligence, it makes for quite a rudimentary task - with the help of Paul Pimsleur, of course.<br />For your own edification, Spanish can be learned, albeit not without effort, without formal training - much of which is useless anyway.  Pimsleur teaches the essential Spanish needed for traveling, working, dining, and awkward social situations.  The CDs make for an easy learn for anyone with half of a brain.  That being said, since one is not provided with a book for the lessons, it is incumbent upon the listener to look up and study any vocabulary and/or verbs that you may find confusing.  I would give it 5 stars if only it were accompanied by a more thorough book that coincided with its lessons.

For starters, most books in the sports genre are dull, uneventful, predictable, and leave little to the imagination.  Although a basketball fan myself, I wasn't overly keen on reading this one.  To say I'm glad I did would be a vast understatement.  Conroy, long known for his semi-autobiographical works that divulge so much of his traumatic childhood, has written his first pure work of nonfiction in the incomparable My Losing Season.<br />Conroy takes us through his unbearably torturous plebe year at The Citadel as he endured unremitting physical torment bordering on categorical sadism - the likes of which he already had suffered from his father.  Conroy recounts how it was only on the basketball court where the reticent Pat felt alive and allowed to shine in a futile attempt to build a bond with his mercilessly abusive father.  The 12 man team of The Citadel 1966-67 basketball team that had a losing season and lost in the first round of The Southern Conference tournament may not sound like a great subject for a book.  That being said, words cannot truly do justice to My Losing Season.<br />It is only through adversity and the stigma created by losing, Conroy writes, that one ideally discovers - via introspective reflection - the person one truly is.  Losing, in turn, brings out the best in some and the worst in others.  Moreover, it provides previously unexploreed opportunities for self-discovery and growth.  Simply stated, My Losing Season is a book that should not only be read, but cherished as a keepsake on one's bookshelf as a pillar of sagacity and wisdom.	2003-08-29

While devoid of his political views and political history, Faith of My Fathers delves into the very soul of the person, not the politician, that is John McCain.  From his adventurous childhood to his rebellious youth, McCain recounts everything - all the while making for an insightful, entertaining and poignant read.<br />Injecting his dry sardonic humor, McCain tells of his trying ordeal in the Vietnamese POW camp as he was beaten, tortured, and starved - all after suffering a broken leg and back while ejecting from his fighter plane after being shot down.

While devoid of his political views and political history, Faith of My Fathers delves into the very soul of the person, not the politician, that is John McCain.  From his adventurous childhood to his rebellious youth, McCain recounts everything - all the while making for an insightful, entertaining and poignant read.<br />Injecting his dry sardonic humor, McCain tells of his trying ordeal in the Vietnamese POW camp as he was beaten, tortured, and starved - all after suffering a broken leg and back while ejecting from his fighter plane after being shot down.  McCain's righteous indignation towards his hostile captors while refusing to devulge nothing more than &quot;The big three&quot; as they beat him senselessly evokes a paradoxical feeling of disdain for his captors as well as an overwhelming sense of pride and patriotism as well.

Two words: ghost writer.  Two more: political diatribe.  Two more: blatant anti-semitism.  Furthermore, Lisa, who purportedly never liked her birth name anyway, runs on like a broken record about how idyllic and utopian her patrician marriage to King Hussein was on every page - it was all peaches and cream - sans any spats or problems in over 20 years of marriage - yeah, right.<br />Her self-aggrandizement and flatulent self-importance of how she was a dynamic pioneer as the first Queen to be a social reformer is self-serving at best.  Her less than subtle pervasive ant-semitism proves most disturbing: \\"The Arabs feared, and it turned out rightly, that some of the Zionist Jews beginning to arrive in Palestine had no intention of sharing the land but wanted it all for their own.\\"  Her continual reference to \\"the powerful Zionist lobby\\" in America and how it controls America & has blinded Americans from the plight of the poor suicide bombers is unsettling to digest.  Her constant harping on how Hussein's supposed sole mission in life was his unwavering quest for peace in the Middle East on every page made me nauseous.  Her inclusion of \\"The Prophet Muhammad, May Peace be Upon Him\\" whenever mentioning Muhammad was the icing on the cake.  Recommended to those philistine degenerates who savor fallacious political propaganda written by a ghost writer.  Good stuff.	2003-07-30

Among the many double standards of the Left is the constant nauseating supplication for free speech in order to bash America and its leaders from the likes of anti-American traitors such as Michael Moore, Al Franken, and Hillary Clinton, but, needless to say, when Coulter(or anyone for that matter) even mentions the word \\"patriotism\\" she is feverishly shunned and ostracized for even considering exercising her free speech rights.  If Al Franken and Michael Moore can spew forth their insipid and inane \\"funny\\" liberal rants, then one good turn deserves another.<br />\\"Liberals react to the American flag like Linda Blair did to holy water in The Exorcist.\\"<br />\\"Liberals are like children on a car trip, but not as cute, incessantly demanding to know if we're there yet.\\"<br />\\"In Baghdad, Sean Penn visited hospitals and posed in front of photos of Saddam Hussein.

No one wants to work for someone like that.&quot;  &quot;True leadership requires choosing, in every instance, the position that allows you to sleep at night.&quot;  &quot;You cannot ask those who work for you to do something you're unwilling to do yourself.&quot;<br />These prescient dictums are not just shallow platitudes spewed forth by the author(no ghost writer here), but the words Giuliani actually lives by.  Unlike many ponitificating politicians, Giuliani actually says what he means, and means what he says.  Leadership quite possibly could be the best book I have read this year.  It's not just about his masterful handling of 9/11 and his heroic overcoming of prostate cancer, but more importantly of the virtues of being a leader.  Giuliani candidly recounts many anecdotes and ties them in to his development as a leader.  He humbly admits that he wasn't born a leader, but rather developed into one through his life experiences and neverending voracious appetite for learning.<br />Leadership is a book that anyone can profit from - regardless of where you are in life.  Those who value honesty, proof over theories, and results over rhetoric will truly gain the most from this erudite offering.	2003-07-08

Surprising? Yes, perhaps.  But, nonetheless, Bruce, like so many other former liberals, has been disappointed and disenchanted by the sheer charlatanism, decadence and rapidly decling moral clarity of the liberal elite.<br />Bruce exposes the blatant hypocrisy and the moral vacuum that the Left has conveniently created to disseminate their Leftist agenda.  Bruce delineates the many examples of liberal shenanigans and charades -  including how murdering 3,000 Americans isn't terrorism, but rather Freedom Fighters acting heroically against an oppressor.  Bruce exposes the liberal agenda of the academic intelligentsia and how they &quot;embrace a perverse moral relativism that will take us further into a world devoid of right and wrong.&quot;  Intelligent and provocative reading.

This time around, his premonition originates from the burgeoning science of nanotechnology.  Of course, as in all of Crichton's books, man's selfish pursuit for power, money, and fame consume his antagonists into an all-encompassing quest of self-indulgence.  This undoubtedly leads to chaos and man's loss of control of this powerful, yet arcane, technology.<br />Crichton being one of the few modern authors that I enjoy reading, I have enjoyed virtually all of his books.  Prey, although a little less substantive than some of his other books, nonetheless proves to be a fun, entertaining, and thought-provoking book worth a look.  Prey, if nothing else, is a page-turner that you will fly through enjoyably in a couple of days.	2003-07-01

He's his own man - a veritable self-styled mercenary in American politics.  Morris has singularly carved an unforgettable niche in the American political landscape with his uncommon wit and candor coupled with his undeniable political accumen and penchant for winning.<br />Always entertaining when on Hannity & Colmes, Morris candidly and expertly delineates, and subsequently roasts, the obstructionists, crooks, and traitors in politics, media, and business in Off With Their Heads.  Morris astutely points out the unconscionable media bias of The Old Gray Lady in its liberally-weighted push polling, editorial, and front page articles.  As Morris says, \\"All the news that fits, they print.\\"<br />Morris spares no one from his wrath: including the Hollywood apologists, France(\\"from great to ingrate\\"), Clinton, and many more.  Having met Morris at a book signing for this book, I am pleased to note he is as personable in person as he is on TV.

No other CEO in modern times has been as instrumental in such a monumental turnaround of a corporation as has Jack Welch with GE.  Welch recounts his impressive and expeditious rise to the top of the food chain as well as his unique and provocative strategies that catapulted him there.<br />This book proves to be a veritable must have for anyone who desires to learn a thing or two about improving upon one's management credo.  Welch divulges anecdotes with self-effacing humor including the revolutionary concepts that helped forge his place in corporate history.  Included are such simple, yet oftentimes overlooked, ideas such as boundaryless sharing of ideas, an intense focus on ideas, an informal give-and-take style that makes bureaucracy the enemy, and of course, his efficacious cornerstone of differentiation.  Read it and learn from the best.<br />As Jack so laconically states, &quot;Never underestimate the other guy.&quot;	2003-06-24

Morris chronicles his triangulation strategy that unfortunately led to Clinton's improbable 2nd term.  Morris operated largely in secret as &quot;Charlie&quot; over the phone and later in and out of the East Wing while Clinton's staff worked separately in the West Wing.<br />Morris tells how Clinton instructs Morris to continue with the subterfuge to avoid the largely ineffective and overly quarrelsome Leon Panetta and Harold Ickes.  Without Morris and his insight, Clinton no doubt would not have signed the Republican-sponsored Welfare Reform Act and would have lost in 1996.  Morris, who is a foot shorter than Clinton, was tackled by Clinton while in Arkansas, only later to be consoled by Hillary as she told him that Bill only does that to people he loves.

Olson chronicles Hillary's ascension to the top of the Democratic party - by all means necessary.  The real Hillary - the high priestess of feminism, a cold, calculating and maniacal power-hungry tyrant longing to be President - is the real Hillary.<br />Olson keeps you reading through her poignant and piquant look into Hillary and her public persona that she has artfully created throughout her years in the public eye.  From the firing, smearing, and attempted framing of the White House Travel staff, to the ransacking of Vince Foster's office after his ostensible suicide, to billing records that materialized in the White House \\"like a gift from the starship Enterprise,\\" Hillary has proven to be nothing short of a perpetual demagogue and compulsive liar & charlatan.	2003-06-16

I will say that this book proved to be a veritable dichotomy of unrelenting euphoria intertwined with an inexplicable cryptic moroseness.  Difficult to explain, yet when you read it you will understand.  Quite unlike any other book I've read in a while.<br />The characterization by Alice Sebold is superb as she engenders a genuine empathy for our amiable protagonist Susie along with an equally ineluctable disdain for the antagonist Mr. Harvey.  The entire book I found myself seeking justice for the tragic transgression committed - only to be somewhat let down at the anticlimactic conclusion.  Overall, The Lovely Bones proves to be a unique page-turner that you can't put down.  I liken it to a poor man's To Kill a Mockingbird - but that's still high praise, nonetheless.	2003-06-04

And Michael Durant and his whole team of Task Force Ranger most certainly never did.  Durant's tenacity, perseverence, and sheer will to survive through indescribable adversity prove a testament to his unwavering duty to his country and his fellow 160th Special Ops Night Stalker comrades.  Durant, although bruised and battered almost beyond recognition, incredibly survived against all odds after losing his whole crew and 2 of the most valiant and selfless soldiers America will ever call her own: Randy Shughart and Gary Gordon.<br />Durant tells how rightfully disappointed he and his team were that they were refused permission to finish their mission for which 17 lives were lost in Somalia.  When asked to come to The White House to visit President Clinton, Durant wisely demurred.  Clinton, whose administration sent its young men into harm's way to participate in a highly dangerous mission without giving them the proper tools requested in order to assure victory, dropped the ball big time in Somalia.<br />As Durant so aptly states, &quot;Trust and empower your people to do their jobs, then stand behind them.&quot;  Too bad Clinton failed to do so.	2003-06-03

So, needless to say, I was somewhat confused when reading The Clinton Wars.  I like how Blumenthal mentioned how victorious Clinton was in all of his war efforts including Somalia, Haiti, Rwanda, and Bosnia.  Being a big war buff, I know, now that I read this, that Clinton never dodged the draft.  I also learned that Clinton never lied about anything.  Wow! I'm glad I read this cause I guess I had all of my facts wrong or something.  After reading this, I learned how Clinton was the clairvoyant President who ushered in unprecedented growth in his impeccable tenure.<br />Thanks to Sid Blumenthal, I now know that all of the negativity I was hearing about infidelity, perjuring to a federal grand jury, selling pardons, stealing the White House china, selling nuclear secrets to China, appeasing North Korea, and turning down Osama bin Laden were all nothing more than spurious fallacies lodged from the vicious right wing conspiracy.

Hmm...kind of rings a bell with Iraq  - the Monday morning quarterback liberals saying how they knew we would win, but they just didn't want to say it beforehand.  Yeah, right.<br />When it comes to classic liberalism, are the liberals really liberal? Are they the ones instituting change or fighting it tooth and nail? In recent years, the latter rings true.  The so-called \\"liberals\\" want to fight tax cuts for working Americans, condone the indiscriminate torture, rape, and genocide of innocent Iraqis, increase big government, eliminate faith-based initiatives, play the race card, filibuster judicial nominees interminably, decry the merit of school vouchers despite sending their kids to private schools, proudly proclaim a former KKK member as one of their leadesr, and, when in doubt, whine that they're being called \\"unpatriotic\\" when they do espouse their nonsense rhetoric.<br />In the classical sense of the word, conservatives are the real liberals(but we're not useful idiots like Hillary) - the ones pressing for change and reform in government - i.e. Campaign Finance Reform via John McCain & tax cuts to put money back where it belongs - in the hands of the people who made it - not a Marxist redistribution of the wealth.	2003-05-29

John McCain is one of these few rare creatures that are slowly growing extinct in a political climate that readily denounces instead of encouraging political reform and true representation of one's constituency.  As the noble McCain-Feingold Campaign Finance Reform is pondered by the Supreme Court for its supposed unconstitutionality and concurrently eviscerated by machine politicians such as Mitch McConnell, John McCain continues his admirably idealistic and iconoclastic approach to political reform: It's worth the fighting for.<br />As the vast multitude of Senators surreptitiously sneak in pork barrel earmarks that waste taxpayers billions of dollars per year, McCain espouses a line item veto - where the President can eliminate such wasteful expenditures while still signing the bill into law.  McCain is loath to the inherent corruption and undue influence that soft money has effected upon the election process under the auspices of ostensibly independent ads on the eve of elections.  Corruption, pork barrel politics, dishonesty, apathy, and anti-Americanism are all anathema to the most distinguished and honorable Senator in our great country - John McCain.  I highly recommend this memoir.  Just as McCain does so commendably with his politics, he has put his heart into it as only he can.	2003-05-21

As Michelle pithily states, &quot;The safety of our citizens must come before the comfort and convenience of foreigners.&quot; Malkin expertly delineates the complex looming dilemma at hand - the inexcusable lack of government coordination and willingness to keep illegal aliens out of our country.  The airline and tourism industry, politicians pandering for ethnic votes, diplomatic kowtowing, and political croynism have all superseded national security.<br />For those who have given negative reviews of Invasion due to its &quot;liberal bashing,&quot; well, you ony show your ignorance as you evidently have yet to read the book.  Malkin has written an unabashedly candid rebuke of the lack of accountability within the INS and government in general - while sparing no one from blame.  She is harsh on President Bush and his desire to enact a bipartisan bill with Senator Daschle allowing immediate amnesty for all illegal aliens.  Malkin then denounces Ashcroft for his continuation of the Clinton legacy by broadening victim status and extending the stays of illegal aliens indefinitely through T-Visas.<br />As Malkin states, &quot;there will be howling protestations from the usual suspects.

Bennett denounces the rampant and rabid moral relativism that regrettably currently pervades the American landscape akin to that of a growing plague.<br />This apathetic and blase attitude of moral relativism, as Bennett states, has virulently infected the moral fabric of our society in the insidious guise of liberalism.  Instead of fighting for freedom and liberty and eliminating injustice, the liberals condone the continued rape, murder, and merciless torture of a whole country in the name of \\"peace.\\"  Can you be any more idiotically hypocritcal?  Didn't think so.  My two cents worth on this book: Provocative edification.	2003-04-28

From humble beginnings in rural Oklahoma to star Sooner QB to luminary Congressman, Watts recounts his life in expert fashion to make for an enthrallingly good read.  Watts has always been a leader grounded in good faith and family values - a true original when in comes to Washington, D.C. demagoguery.  And that's exactly what has endeared him to his many fans and supporters - and conversely that's what also has angered many outside - and within - the Republican pary.  Watts was never known to back down from a good fight.  He is willing to take a principled stand for what he believes in and resists the coercive influence to always vote in deference to party leadership.<br />As Watts explains, character-building experiences have helped him to see beyond political orthodoxy and the rigid constraints of group identity to make him the extraordinary leader that he is today.  He is willing to embrace new models to solve old problems - unlike most politicians.  Watts has always been a man of God, resiliency, resolve, unwavering principle, and old-fashioned family values.  He is sorely missed in Washington as there are few true leaders like him remaining.<br />&quot;No man is free who is not master of himself.&quot;	2003-04-27

Hawthorne, himself having grown up in Puritan Salem, writes from first-hand experience of the unwavereing rigidity and intolerance of Puritan society.  Hester Prynne, having committed the unthinkable sin of adultery and conceiving her illegitimate child Pearl, becomes a veritable pariah as she is forced to live on the outskirts of town and wear the ignominious scarlet letter A on her bosom for eternity.<br />In sanctimonious colonial Salem, Hester's impropriety is tantamount to murder in today's society.  She, however, should not have to bear the guilt alone.  As they say, it takes two to tango.  Reverend Dimmesdale, in his absolute cowardice, is just as, if not moreso, guilty than Hester.  Furthermore, the biggest coward and hypocrite proves to be none other than her spineless husband, Roger Chillingworth.  I must say that the reading was at times a bit laborious, but a good read nonetheless.  I must further confess that the movie version with Demi Moore is much more rewarding, although the book should undoubtedly be read first.	2003-04-23

Buzz Patterson tells of his shocking first-hand accounts of his inept Commander in Chief as his ubiquitous football carrier.  From Clinton's choice of watching a golf tournament while ignoring Sandy Berger's request to bomb Iraq to his refusal to nab Osama bin Laden, we learn first-hand of the sheer ineptitude of our 42nd President.<br />From declassifying nuclear secrets to selling them to China, Clinton never ceased to amaze as to the unfathomable depths of sedition to which he ignominiously plunged.  I highly enjoyed Barbara Olson's book.  This book is similar, but with the unique perspective of one who was Clinton's shadow at all times(I almost feel sorry for him).  If Clinton gutted the military any more than he did, we might as well not even have one.  Incompetence personified.	2003-04-17

F. Scott Fitzgerald has given us a timeless treasure to read and enjoy time and time again.  The illusion of grandeur &amp; the disillusion of marriage coupled with the search for love, happiness, The American Dream, as well as the imperceptibly foreboding desire to rekindle the past all make The Great Gatsby an incredibly entertaining, yet highly enigmatic, masterpiece of a novel.<br />No one can deny the greatness of F. Scott Fitzgerald.  No author since has had the unique gift of such masterful and captivating use of the English language  - combined with unparalleled social insight into his age and time.  The excessively lavish and glitzy, yet highly impersonal, fetes of Gatsby, make one feel as if one is in attendance partaking in the debauchery - thanks to the effortless and fluid prose of Fitzgerald.  The classic American tragic figure, Gatsby symbolizes all that we want to be, and not be, at the same time.  Exemplary masterpiece.<br />&quot;And I like large parties.  They're so intimate.  At small parties there isn't any privacy.&quot; - Jordan Baker	2003-04-16

Whenever I hear McCain is to appear on Hannity & Colmes or another show, I make it a point to tune in - because I know something provocative - and possibly something controversial, may be said.  That's what sets McCain apart from the politically correct force-fed politicians of today - he refuses to rigidly adhere to the strident dogma of party lines.  McCain, instead, subscribes to his own agenda - one of morality, reform, and good old-fashioned honesty.<br />While Elizabeth Drew primarily delineates McCain's co-authored monumental McCain-Feingold Campaign Finance Reform Bill throughout the book, she all the while allows us to delve into the innerworkings of the McCain office and his devoted staff.  While others in his own party(and those outside as well) bash him and label him as being bitter towards Bush as to why he didn't back the President's tax cuts, McCain proves that he, above all, is a man of principle, not party line.  True American patriots like John McCain are few and far between.  As SC Senator Lindsey Graham says, \\"The thing about John McCain is that if you ever get to be his friend, he'll be with you thick and thin.  There ain't a lot of that up here.\\"	2003-04-15

A one day read, Siddharth is as equally short as it is profound. Although centered around one individual's spiritual journey through life, Siddhartha is much more than a trite diatribe on religion, or Buddhism for that matter. It is more of a cathartic illumination of self-discovery of the title character, Siddhartha, as he learns the lessons and meaning of life the hard way - through his own experiences.<br />A brahmin's quixotic and inquisitive son, initially Siddhartha devoutly adheres to the ascetic lifestyle of the shramana wanderer. A journey, though profligate and debaucherous in nature, teaches Siddhartha the importance of finding, as opposed to simply seeking. For, if we are to only seek, Siddhartha says, we merely uncover what we already know to be underneath. Conversely, if we set out to genuinely find, we will, indeed, gain new knowledge. It is only through sincere finding, says Siddhartha, that we can truly obtain wisdom and understanding. Overall, a short, yet immensely provocative and recommended read.	2003-04-15

That being said, this book has the feel of a liberal who, through experiencing liberal demagoguery first-hand, was able to finally see through the blatant ambivalence of the blame America first Left for what it is - sheer hypocrisy.  From the intro, Bruce had me enthralled and amazed at the innumerable amount of instances of how insidiously the New Thought Police has taken over the collective minds of America.<br />&quot;The left implements speech and mind control because they know they cannot truly persuade on the issues; silencing the opposition becomes their only recourse.&quot;  Unfortunate, but true.  The leftist radical anti-establishment liberals of the 60's have now become the very epitome of what they once despised - the establishment.  Look no further than Hillary Clinton, John Kerry, and Tom Daschle.  A great book that I highly recommend to all - even liberals(maybe they'll wake up).  The only bone I have to pick with Tammy is her cognitive dissonance exhibited when she was the L.A. NOW President - when she boycotted the release of the American Psycho book due to what she deemed excessive violence to women.  Tammy, isn't this attempt at censorship a key example of what the Thought Police would do?	2003-04-07

When reading the book, you not only feel like you're there in the bustling and chaotic Bakara Market in impoverished Mogadishu, you also feel like you are a veritable member of Task Force Ranger.  Bowden takes you, the reader, to the site of this tumultuous bloodshed vicariously through his exquisite and no-holds-barred account of modern warfare.<br />So much better than the movie, the book fully engrosses you and makes you root for the Rangers and Delta Force members, as they find themselves in for a real barn burner in hostile territory, overwhelmingly outnumbered by thousands of hostile drugged-out AK-47 toting clansmen.  Despite only losing 18 valiant men to hundreds, if not thousands(depends who you ask) of Sammys, many seem to chalk The Battle of Mogadishu up as a destitute failure.  Although it would have been a resounding success, if not for the inaction and incompetence of Secretary of Defense Les Aspin and President Clinton, Task Force Ranger nonetheless achieved their objectives of extracting two high-ranking clan leaders.  The procurement of AC-130 Gunships, Abrams Tanks, and Bradley Fighting Vehicles, as requested by General Montgomery - and subsequently denied by Aspin, would have assured a more pragmatic, and in turn, more successful battle plan.  This book is a tribute to the brave men and women, like Randy Shughart and Gary Gordon, who fight, and oftentimes die, so that we may be free.	2003-04-07

Horowitz, a former far left anti-war activist of the 60's, knows the virtually isurmountable depths to which the Left will plunge in order to achieve their egomaniacal objectives - power and prestige.<br />Horowitz explicates the Democrats' insular and inane platform: Big Government that should, when in doubt, tax and tax again mercilessly -  and spend your hard-earned money on a wasteful bureaucratic agenda that serves the Democrats' own agenda.  Horowitz explains the incessant pandering of the Dems to their indigent and indolent constituents consisting of illegal aliens, minorities, and anti-Americans.  They somehow continue to maintain their voter base through a degrading, yet somehow effective, strategy that instills fear into their followers' hearts that the Republicans will eliminate Social Securtiy, abortion, and institute a racist regime the moment they are elected.  This book should evoke fear into the hearts of sanctimonious fearmongering Dems everywhere.	2003-04-07

D'Souza slams and debunks the blame America first leftist crowd's weak argument of liberalism by exposing it for what it truly is - blatant hypocrisy.  They claim to be for human rights, but are willing to stand by and watch a dictatorial despot indiscriminately rape and murder his own people and commit genocide.<br />While liberals vigorously fight for animal rights through organizations such as PETA, they, in turn, deem it justifiable to kill human babies because they're \\"not alive yet.\\"  And, just as Affirmative Action eliminates the freedom of choice by employers and colleges; so, too, does it not only devalue black achievement and intensify doubts about black capacity, it, in and of itself, advocates the very thing it espouses to prevent - selection via racial preference.  D'Souza makes for well-articulated and intelligent read.  I could not put it down.	2003-04-01

Although short and compact in size, Lord of the Flies proves to be anything but that in breadth and depth.  Nothing short of incredible, Golding's novella examines human nature and its internal and external variables that wield it into shape.  An allegory no less, the pages of Lord of the Flies nonetheless come alive as they provocatively bring the reader into a paradoxical world of bestial Darwinian survival of the fittest versus rational deductional logic and care for one's fellow man.<br />Unlike The Catcher in the Rye, Lord of the Flies asserts that human nature is inherently evil - not corrupted by external forces, but rather an intrinsic trait to be overcome.  Our innocence is not lost by some terrible experience, because conversely we have never had it.  While evil exists in all of us, Golding says, we must conquer it and make a decision based on logic and sound reasoning to consciously reject it, and, in turn, not revert to barbarous savagery.  We, as individuals, must cognizantly and wisely choose the righteous, yet discerning path of Ralph, as opposed to the malevolent and malicious evil one of Jack, or for that matter, the indecisive and naive path of hapless Piggy.	2003-03-31

Is Macbeth motivated by unadulterated avarice, ambition, by the witches, or his wife? An interesting and mystifying conundrum for the ages.  Macbeth, unique unlike other Shakespearean tragic figures, murders his victim, the noble and just Duncan, without any provocation, without having been purportedly wronged in any way, shape, or form.<br />Whereas Hamlet has just provocation in the wickedness of Claudius, Othello suspects Desdemona of infidelity, Brutus, in his reasoning, deems it a necessary evil for the republic to assassinate Caesar due to his ambition, conversely Macbeth murders others who have done him no wrong to speak of.  Lady Macbeth, in her infinite guile and cunning, proves to transcend literature - as we all have known ruthless and amoral opportunists such as her.  Macbeth, due to its authentic ingenuity, is among my favorite Shakespeare.  How can you not enjoy such a sanguine and yet powerful play infused with such morose death and gloom?	2003-03-31

Feiler objectively delineates the first interfaith examination of the man chosen by God to be the patriarch of his people.  He thoughtfully and rigorously dissects Abraham through the scripture, teachings, research, sometimes heated interviews, and, of course, his many dangerous travels through The Holy Land to the very sites of the historic happenings.<br />I must admit, albeit a short work, I gained quite a bit of knowledge from Feiler and his spontaneous, yet well-constructed writing style.  I learned quite a bit about the current Middle East conflict between the Palistinians and Israel and the prevailing open hostility of many Muslim people toward Israeli Jews.  Feiler discusses jihad - according to The Koran it is NOT a justification for violence, but rather an invitation to Islam for \\"infidels.\\"  Regrettably, the fundamentalist sects have made their own contrary interpretation.  One tidbit: Ishmael was purportedly to be sacrificed, not Isaac, by Abraham, according to The Koran.  Interesting and provocative stuff.  Definitely worth a look-see.	2003-03-31

D'Souza, while using a fictional college student named Chris as his addressee, intelligently articulates a fresh and exciting philosophy of passionate conservatism.  This conservatism, as he points out, is not the nonsensical hypocritical Old European kind.  Rather, conservatism is the only logical and moral choice for all Americans who genuinely aspire to greatness by means of their own ingenuity, and with the freedom and liberty that is available only in America.<br />D'Souza easily debunks liberalism and libertarianism as inferior to conservatism.  First off, liberalism, in all its supposed pro-choice dogma, doesn't give employers a choice to chooose its own employees thanks to affirmative action.  Affirmative action not only perpetuates the insinuation that African-Americans are inferior by aiding in their selection by employers and colleges, it demonstrably achieves the reverse of what it purports to eliminate - discrimination of candidates based solely on their skin color.<br />Secondly, libertarianism, in its manifest wisdom, strongly disdains government involvement as well as drug regulation.  While less government is intertwined in Republicanism as well, D'Souza points out that government must be a supplier of a strong national defense and illicit drugs must be regulated.  Without some government intervention and a national defense we would no doubt witness total chaos.  D'Souza brings unbridled passion to his writing which makes for a quick, fun, and informative read.  A great book to refute the bed-wetting liberal demagogue.	2003-03-31

For those of us, yours included, who absolutely enjoy and revere Hamlet, this is the next logical sequence after reading Hamlet.  Although not on the level of Hamlet by any means - but, then again, what is? - Ros and Guil(as called in the play) are Dead proves to be a witty and fun play, nonetheless.  With all of the carnage and gratuitous death witnessed in Hamlet, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern prove undoubtedly the most undeserving victims, and undeniably the most inscrutable and ambiguous characters who face their deaths.<br />They know virtually nothing of the circumstances and we, in turn, know virtually nothing about them as well.  Are they friends of Hamlet at Elsinore to help the troubled Prince in his time of despair while half-heartedly serving the King? Or, conversely, are they conniving duplicitous informers who know about Hamlet's seemingly impending death in England?  Stoppard gives intriguing and clever dialogue between our two clueless and unsuspecting heroes.  A fun play with a genuine and authentic melange of comedy and intensity.  Recommended for all Hamlet enthusiasts - just don't expect the greatness of Shakespeare.	2003-03-29

Well, I don't know, but this book will help you find it.  It invokes a simple enough concept that you would think everyone would already have instituted it in their professional and personal lives.  Amazingly, this is undoubtedly not the case.  Cheese is a metaphor, first of all, for everything in life that you want or need.  This simple, yet profound, allegory makes you think about your own situation and if you are, in fact, moving with the cheese, inspecting the cheese daily, and savoring the cheese that you do have while concurrently vigilantly inspecting for changes and new cheese.<br />The most germane and significant message to me personally is that the intangible fear of change is always much greater than the actual change itself.  One must, as Haw does in the story, discover that change will oftentimes lead to better cheese and is not to be feared.  The audio version is especially well told.  It's like listening to a children's story - simple and fun yet relevant and provocative at the same time - a seemingly unimaginable combination.  Highly recommended for all.	2003-03-27

Fortunately for me, that wasn't the case.  I had the pleasure and privilege to read this insightful and invigorating work.  Bruce Feiler, a unorthodox Jewish American from the South, reveals key insights and new knowledge about the Bible and its historical accuracy in regard to time, people, events, and places within the text.  What makes this book unique and authentic is Feiler's ability to intertwine the Bible and its fascinating people and events and bring them alive.<br />Feiler goes from Moses parting The Red Sea to having to deal with overzealous border patrol guards and officials who constantly ask for baksheesh(bribes) or unnecessary questions to confirm his Judaism such as \\"What is the Passover?\\" Feiler takes us through Noah, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Joseph, and Moses and the many tumultuous travails and incredible journeys of each.  From a historical perspective, Walking the Bible is fascinating as it delineates where in modern terms all of the biblical occurrences transpire - i.e. the burning bush supposedly at St. Catherine's, The Ten Commandments on Mt. Sinai, where Abraham took Isaac to be offered as a sacrifice, etc.<br />This is by no means a boring book and should be read by all in search of adventure and more clarity on the Bible.  Feiler brings the Bible alive through his vivid and unwavering and unquestioned passion for his subject.	2003-03-27

He delineates his argument thoroughly and wisely.  That being said, after the first few chapters, Buchanan's rhetoric becomes insipid, trite, and tiresome.  He repeats the same bombast over and over - I guess repetition is the key for Mr. Buchanan.<br />You can learn everything in the entire book by just reading the first few chapters.  Buchanan, while he does have some validity in his assertion, continues to isolate himself more and more - not only from the Left, but from Jewish America as well as from the Republican party itself - as he constantly berates President Bush and questions the necessity to disarm Saddam Hussein.  Perhaps no man is an island, but nonetheless Pat Buchanan has come dangerously close to creating one by himself.	2003-03-22

It's the book your English teacher(and your parents) didn't want you to read in high school.  At times, it is debaucherous and raunchy, but then again so is growing up.  That's what makes this book so great - Bukowski's impressive and unique ability to tell it like it really happened - with no sugar-coating or glossing over the dirty stuff.  Some people say this is comparable to Catcher in the Rye as a rite of passage type book.  I say this is much, much better than Salinger's book - no doubt.  While both have a devoted fan following, Ham on Rye is unique in the sense that it is much more plausible and much more fun.  I not only empathized with Henry and his trying travails and tribulations, I felt like I was there with him - looking at the teacher's legs, getting beat by his Dad, getting drunk with his friends, etc.<br />While this book is not politically correct by any stretch of the imagination and, thus, not for everybody, I unequivocally feel that this is a must read for those of us who are not constrained by limits and boundaries placed upon us by others.

However absurd this may sound to those who have yet to read Cannery Row, it is altogeter true and revealing.  Steinbeck, as is his custom, expertly and artistically endears his lowbrow group of characters to the reader.  While whores & alcoholic bums living on the indigent fringes of Monterey, California may not sound like your cup of tea, they nonetheless make for a great novel.<br />Steinbeck, allowing his characters to speak with candid blue-collar vernacular, ties in his uncanny and unique ability to pull the reader into the woefully downtrodden, yet extraordinarily vibrant, and all too real, world that is Cannery Row.  Just like he so masterfully accomplishes in Of Mice and Men and The Grapes of Wrath, Steinbeck exquisitely explores the inner depths of humanity and the immense resiliency of the human spirit and its inherent propensity to overcome the trials and tribulations of adversity.<br /> Despite being miserably destitute and forlorn by others' standards, the eclectic gang of Cannery Row consciously rises above the utter chaos of soulless ambition and covetousness and, in their genuine indolent happiness, perseveringly subsist as \\"curiously clean.\\"  Short, yet blissfully sweet.	2003-03-10

Scott Fitzgerald	No other author in history has so astutely penned such profound and sublime novels with such amazing social insight as has Scottie(as his contemporaries called him) - all the while doing it with such amazing and unparalleled grace and lucidity. While The Love of the Last Tycoon may not be finished, I can easily discern that F. Scott was well on his way to achieving his goal -penning a novel on the level of The Great Gatsby and not as \\"depressing\\" as Tender is the Night.<br />What makes this so amazing, yet so painful, is the extraordinary potential that this work exudes. The Last Tycoon does seem to be like Gatsby moreso than any other Fitzgerald work in its endearing and sympathetic characters such as the self-made Monroe Stahr, the young Cecilia, & tragic Kathleen. As usual, Fitzgerald recreates and tells of his life experiences - this time of his tumultuous years in Hollywood as a screen writer. Although hardened somewhat at this stage of his career, Fitzgerald, like his hero Stahr, still purveys his characteristic idealism laced with a latent hint of foreboding tragedy inevitably awaiting on the horizon. Stahr, like Fitzgerald, is forever viewed as a boy wonder, despite being a seasoned veteran at this stage of his career, due to his overnight success at age 23. So, Fitzgerald, who had the splendid This Side of Paradise published at age 23, and who also was known for his propensity to turn a sickly pale white just as Stahr does, ingeniously incorporates himself into his work one last time.<br />The incredibly insightful notes, outlines, and revisions written by Fitzgerald shown at the conclusion of the book open an amazing new world of intropection to the reader. I give it 5 stars not for what it is, but for what it would have been. I just finished reading all of his works chronologically and I must say, unequivocally, that this very well could have eclipsed his other works of fiction, all of which are truly sublime.<br />\\"It is an escape into a lavish, romanticpast that perhaps will not come again into our time.\\" - F.

His destitute disenfranchisement from any semblance of normality is not only shocking and frightening, it is downright abominable.  I would hate to spoil this ingenious book for anyone, so I will refrain from dissecting the ending.  However, I must say that it did leave an immensely pungent taste in my mouth - as is intended.<br />1984 is as potent as it is mesmerizing.  It is infinitely unique as there is no other book quite like it, albeit Brave New World is strikingly similar.  Two Minutes of Hate is classic.  Who cannot appreciate the ThoughtPolice, DoubleTalk, DoubleSpeak, and the many other Orwellian words that have been firmly implanted in the English language? 1984 could very well be the most profoundly provocative work of the 20th Century.  1984 projects an appalling, yet veritable premonition in lieu of our continually decreasing civil liberties.  Highly recommended by this humble reviewer.  Enjoy.	2003-03-06

Hemingway's characteristic laconic, terse, and fluid prose and dialogue shine radiantly throughout this book for the ages.  Seeing our country in the midst of the war on terrorism and a growing divisiveness amongst Americans, I feel, regardless of one's stance on war,  For Whom the Bell Tolls is a great book to pick up right now.<br />To stereotype and routinely categorize this great work as nothing more than a \\"war book\\" is to do it a grave injustice.  Hemingway touches on, among other things, love, loyalty, sacrifice for the greater good, rape, suicide, altruism, and social injustice.  For Whom the Bell Tolls manifests itself as a book that speaks to the reader in many indescribable ways.  Hemingway's character development is masterful and unparalleled in literature.  We come to know not only our intrepid protagonist Robert Jordan, moreover we come to know the inner thoughts and feelings of Anselmo, Maria, Pablo, Pilar, and Lieutenant Berrendo as Hemingway ingeniously flips from 3rd to 1st person narrative and then back to 3rd perdson on the drop of a dime.<br />Perhaps the only negative of the book is the annoying censoring of curse words throughout the text such as, \\"I obscenity in the milk of science.\\"  Ironically, Hemingway's hero Robert Jordan fights for the Communist Republic(which of course mandated censorship), and his own book ends up censored.  Go figure.  That being said, I thoroughly enjoyed this powerful tour de force and recommend it highly.	2003-03-05

Scott Fitzgerald has masterfully established himself as undeniably one of the greatest writers of all-time - as well as my favorite writer.  Having read Fitzgerald thoroughly, I can pithily opine that his amazing use of the English language approaches the sublime.  Tender is the Night, written arduously between 1925-1934, is the work of a more polished, mature, as well as hardened, writer than that of the young 23 year-old rookie who wrote the idealistic, yet splendid, This Side of Paradise.<br />That being said, F. Scott does not disappoint by any means.  This poignant and provocative tragic allegorical narrative of Dick and Nicole Diver strikingly, albeit unshockingly for Fitzgerald devotees, resembles F. Scott and Zelda's convoluted & tumultuous marriage.  While F. Scott's alcoholism parallels Dick in an eerie kind of way, Zelda's mental instability and infidelity echo through the character of Nicole.  When reading Tender is the Night, I felt as though I were on the beach in the French Riviera or on the Champs-Elysees in Paris with this group of pretentious and morally depraved bourgeoisie.  Only Fitzgerald has that unique, intangible, & utterly indescribable ability to transport you into his vibrantly decadent world of the 1920's - a world that he brings to life unlike any other ever has - or ever will.  How Hemingway could trash this great work that F. Scott poured his soul into is infantile and beyond me.<br />To quote F. Scott, \\"Gatsby was a tour de force, but this is a confession of faith.\\"	2003-03-02

Nora, feeling constrained by the Norwegian male-dominated society of the 19th Century, literally - and metaphorically- breaks out of its walls, so to speak.  Torvald Helmer, valuing his honor over his love for his wife Nora, galvanizes her to figuratively abandon her doll house - replete with her husband, 2 children, &amp; 2 servants.  She, in striking out on her own, concurrently abandons the rigid social class system of the time, as well as the unwritten rules and mores of society.<br />Notwithstanding the final act being a bit less than I had hoped for, and perhaps being less relevant and poignant now than in the 19th Century, A Doll's House was nonetheless an enjoyable and compelling play worth reading.	2003-02-23

The pervasive themes of Fitzgerald include moral corruption, profligate behavior, agnosticism, selfishness, narcissism, egocentrism, and of course, a sick obsession with money and alcohol.  These themes permeate all too well throughout the beautifully written The Beautiful and Damned(pardon the pun).<br />Released in 1922, 2 years subsequent to the seminal This Side of Paradise and 3 years prior to the magnum opus The Great Gatsby, incomprehensibly, The Beautiful and Damned was not well received critically nor financially.  As a result, history has erroneously filed it under the dubious sophomore jinx category.  Strange it may seem, I vehemently disagree.  As you read this book, you witness first-hand the maturation of an amazing writer.  No American writer of the 20th Century can compare to the profound power and unwavering genius that is F.Scott Fitzgerald.  If you enjoyed The Great Gatsby, you will no doubt enjoy this work - an equally beautifully writen and tragic tale of aspiring morally depraved young Americans in pursuit of The American Dream.<br />\\"Remarkable that a person can comprehend so little and yet live in such a complex civilization.\\"	2003-02-23

Although under 200 pages, What's So Great About America's brevity is replete with immensely substantive depth as well as provocative and insightful arguments that left me not only impressed, but in awe as well.  D'Souza writes with a fluidly lucid style and with such substance in his words that make his book flow all the more smoothly.<br />This was the most intellectually stimulating book that I have read in some while - and that's not due to a lack of reading, mind you.  D'Souza delineates his irrefutable contention that America is the best country on the planet - carefully and intelligently.  D'Souza makes for an entertaining, as well as highly educational read, with a virtual plethora of references including Plato, Aristotle, Rousseau, Voltaire, Adam Smith, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Gandhi, Lincoln, et al.  D'Souza chronicles his citizenship into the U.S. from India and why every American should be proud, not only to live here and call oneself an American, but moreover why we should all be willing to die for our great country, in order to preserve our enduring and unrivaled freedom and liberty, upon which our great country was founded.  This is truly a great work - I eagerly await his next offering.	2003-02-19

Huxley, ostensibly before his massive procurement of hallucinogenic mind-altering drugs, delivered one of the most profoundly provocative, albeit disturbing, works of the 20th Century.  Although the beginning is somewhat prolix and a bit detail-oriented, Brave New World shines brilliantly the rest of the way through this ingeniously written magnum opus.<br />I must admit that Huxley's class distinctions are readily apparent even in today's society - even without genetic cloning.  Every time I encounter some icompetent ingrate, I can't help but consider him an Epsilon semi-moron - how apropos.  Although many of the foreboding elements Huxley delineates throughout Brave New World are somewhat outrageous, I must admit that the ubiquity of the Feelies, soma, sexual promiscuity, declining societal moral values, as well as the pervasive obsession with maintaining one's youthful appearance, emanate, as much, if not more, abundantly, in today's society, as they do in his timeless classic.<br />Perhaps Huxley became somewhat deranged and deluded later in his career, nonetheless, he still had his wits when he penned what is undeniably one of my top 10 books of all-time.Brave New World proves to be a most uniquely novel idea of a novel(pardon the pun).  It comes highly recommended as it is pure unadulterated brain candy.	2003-02-12

I found that David Frum, although a Canadian national, definitively delineates the inner workings of the White House from the day after the Clintons notoriously vandalized The White House well through the war on terror.  Frum  writes how, much to his surprise, he was chosen as a presidential speech writer, despite having written unfavorable newspaper articles reproaching Bush amidst the primary and throughout the election.  Frum, infamously renowned for coining the now ominous \\"axis of evil\\" anecdote in Bush's State of the Union Address, comes across as a very intelligent conservative,  one who doesn't mince words, and it is this refreshing candor that makes The Right Man a compelling and entertaining read.<br />One rather funny account is told by Frum when, at a conference with the Hollywood elite, Barbara Streisand accuses Bush of \\"flip-flopping on emissions standards\\" due to the \\"campaign contributions he got from Enron.\\"  To which, Frum succinctly retorts, \\"This guy's not for sale, you know - not like the last one.\\"  Bravo.

Well, Bernie tried them all - from the inside. Much to his chagrin, they didn't work. So, he had to take matters into his own hands, so to speak, by writing his now infamous op-ed piece in the WSJ. Of course, The Dan(as he is pseudo-affectionately referred to by Bernie) went into a furious rage and Bernie was subsequently yanked off the air - due to his supposed airing of dirty laundry in the public forum. What an ostensibly unspeakably heinous and seditious act, right? Wrong. Bernie tried and tried to bring the palpably and painfully obvious problem of elite Leftist media bias to the proverbial forefront from within, but, of course, to no avail.<br />The elite Leftist media then spuriously and viciously vilified and maliciously maligned Mr. Goldberg into a neo-conservative ideological nut complete with a right-wing agenda and a veritable ax to grind. Bernie lays out his prodigious assertions, and then proceeds to solidly and candidly corroborate them one by one - with irrefutable and undeniable hard evidence. I recommend this book to all Americans - you will never see the news the same again.

If we allow our brains to wither away by watching wasteful drivel like Guy Montag's wife, Mildred, we surrender to the system, and hence, become nothing but another brick in the wall.  Ray Bradbury writes as lucidly and fluently with as vital a message as any of the other infamous dystopian novels such as 1984 and Brave New World.  Just as Orwell and Huxley champion the cogence of individuality over mere conformity, so too, does Bradbury.<br />Although Guy Montag is the endearing protagonist and his Captain Beatty the intrepid, yet enigmatic antagonist, it is none other than the characters of Clarisse and Mildred that most intigue me.  They emanate resoundly as complete foils for each other.  Whereas Mildred woefully lacks even any remote semblance of vision, love, passion, or originality, Clarisse conversely possesses an abundant amount of vigor, vibrancy, ingenuity, and genuine zest for life.  Guy undergoes an epiphany upon the inscrutable disappearance of Clarisse that, in turn, galvanizes from within his desire to live again.  Not only does he begin to read books again, albeit surreptitiously, moreover he also embarks upon a journey to think for himself again, as it were.  No longer allowing Captain Beatty or the Mechanical Hound to motivate his conformity through fear tactics, Guy Montag begins upon a new and unchartered path - one that will undoubtedly lead to happiness in the absence of conformity.  Fahrenheit 451 is undeniably a timeless classic and should thus be treated as such.  5 HUGE STARS.	2003-02-09

Matthews, renowned for his frequent and oftentimes amusing interruptions of guests on Hardball, runs through the proverbial gamut of politics, life, movies, and success in this, his latest installment.  What makes Matthews so entertaining is his his brash and unpredictable hyperkinetic energy that invariably leads to inscrutable questions from left field that, in turn, leave his poor guests on their toes, and more times than not, baffled due to their inability to spit out their indoctrinated diatribes.<br />Matthews tells of his conservative Irish Catholic upbringing in Philly, his indelible Peace Corps years in Swaziland, his ascension on Capitol Hill from a menial Capitol policeman guarding the Pentagon Papers to speechwriter for President Carter and chief aide to Speaker Tip O'Neill, and ultimately to becoming the independent newsman of today.  Along the way, Matthews tells, as a bold idealist in his 20's, of his failed attempt to run for Congress in Pennsylvania against a corrupt machine politician.  Just as he does so well on Hardball, so too in this book, does Matthews exude a true and admirable passion for his job, politics, and his country and the basis on which it is founded: honor, freedom, liberty, and respect.  Although a bit short, nonetheless an incisive and fun read regardless of partisan leaning.	2003-02-08

I am in concurrence with this having just finished Crime and Punishment.  While I highly recommend this seminal and profound work to all, as Raskolnikov would say, extraordinary individuals outside of the lowly laboring class of the abysmally inept proletariat, I must say that I do not plan on rereading it anytime in the near future.<br />The dark and morbid cover of the book omniously more than sets the foreboding tone of this deep look into the morose psyche of a tainted and morally depraved intellectual.  The ubiquitous gloom and pervading despair permeate throughout Crime and Punishment as we witness the pestilence endured in St. Petersburg in the 19th Century.  The continuous coughing of blood by the perpetually sick, the heavy vodka drinking, the gloom of poverty, the virtual starvation of many, the using of \\"the yellow passport\\" by Sonia solely in order to maintain sustenance for her family, as well as the remorseless murder of the pawnbroker and Lizveta all contribute to the dissolute debauchery and moral depravity exuded by Dostoevsky.<br />Is it jusifiable to commit heinous acts on morally corrpt individuals for the betterment of society? Does the despicable means of murder of the dirty, old pawnbroker justify the taking of rubles and jewelry to distribute to those less fortunate who are of good moral standing? Raskolnikov adheres to this belief using reason over conscience thinking great men such as Napoleon are allowed to overstep the laws of man for the betterment of society.  After the murders, Raskolnikov finds himself \\"trapped in dreary solitude from which there was no escape.\\"  It is refreshingly profound, and altogether surprising, when Raskolnikov undergoes an epiphany of sorts and finally feels genuine and unadulterated remorse while banished in Siberia.  While very dark and macabre, Crime and Punishment comes as a highly recommended, albeit a highly provocative and involving work.  Be prepared to put on your proverbial thinking cap, so to speak.

The late John Kennedy Toole penned a veritably irrefutable masterpiece in the ingenious A Confederacy of Dunces.  Although inestimably depressing that he committed suicide due to Simon Schuster's publication refusal, Toole and his incomparable genius live on vicariously through this resounding work of undeniable merit.<br />I find it seemingly impossible and self-defeating to sum up this great work so as not to be redundant or spoil it for others.  Suffice it to say, I tore through this book in two days and reveled in its farcical and satirical ingenuity as I laughed out loud early and often, as it were, that I actively yearned for it not to come to a close.  The anachronistic, bombastic, and verbose rhetoric of our intrepid & endearing protagonist, Ignatius J. Reilly, riotously pervades A Confederacy of Dunces and makes for the most incredibly vital and overtly comical character I have encountered since Shakespeare's Falstaff himself in Henrvy IV I&II.  John Kennedy Toole's amazingly vivid characterization and unparalleled cynicism emanate throughout this bona fide tour de force with an unmistakably resonant subtlety.  As the irrepressible Ignatius would note, it would be absolutely shameless effrontery and an utterly unspeakable abomination for A Confederacy of Dunces NOT to be mentioned among the top 10 American novels of all-time - this goes without saying.  5 Shining Stars!<br />\\"I dust a bit...in addition, I am at the moment writing a lengthy indictment against our century.

A Moveable Feast, the unique term used to describe Paris of the 1920's, reads like The Sun Also Rises - with great dialogue and characters. In fact, in the preface, Hemingway states, \\"If the reader prefers, this may be regarded as fiction.\\"<br />Hemingway admits to leaving out some details and happenings - some that were widely known and others that were \\"secrets\\". That being said, Hem(as he is affectionately called - seeing as he loathes Ernest) nonetheless emits a plethora of juicy details and tidbits that make A Moveable Feast a compelling and delightful novella - even if it is nonfiction.<br />Hemingway runs the entire gamut(a word F. Scott uses much to Hem's displeasure) with his eclectic cast of expatriates including the virtually blind James Joyce, the alcoholic genius hypochondriac that is F. Scott Fitzgerald, the influential & eccentric Gertrude Stein, the elitist Ford Maddox Ford, the bel esprit of Ezra Pound, the selfish, insane, and terribly jealous Zelda Fitzgerald, a fellow who he profanely derides named Hal whom I suspect is Henry Miller and many, many more. By the way, we learn that La Generation Perdue inadvertently was coined by a garage mechanic of Gertrude Stein, not Gertrude herself.  An indescribable feeling of vibrancy, vigor, and passion emanate from A Moveable Feast as Hemingway, despite being poor, inherently loves his life, writing, sipping his cafe de cremes and white wines in Paris cafes, as well as his continuously changing circle of friends.  I highly recommend this short, yet unforgettable work, to all who want to learn what it truly was like when Hemingway was poor and unestablished living check to check - and nonetheless exerting an invigorating joie de vivre.  Paris in the 20's - a time and place magically unlike any other in history.<br />\\"It was all part of the fight against poverty that younever win except by not spending.

A juicy example - Deputy Secretary of State conveying to Colin Powell, \\"They're eating cheese on you\\"(military for you're getting used) when Rumsfeld and Cheney contradict Powell's earlier statements necessitating the U.N. Inspectors in Iraq.<br />Having read Fighting Back by Bill Sammon and enjoying it thoroughly, I likewise found Bush at War to be compelling, albeit with more focus on CIA and its chief George Tenet. At times, I thought I was reading a Tom Clancy novel when the CIA paramilitary operatives Hank and Gary(1st names only for obvious reasons) undertake their clandestine operations with suitcases full of $3M to buy off the suspect Northern Alliance and Taliban commanders. I found it chock-full of interesting, and sometimes shocking insider info from the NSC meetings that made it completely worthwhile and quite a veritable page turner. As Woodward said on Larry King, thank goodness for the 1st Amendment or this stuff would not be available to the American public. Although the administration is most likely not overly pleased with the release of much of this previously classified information, we as the American public are priveleged to have Woodward so expertly pen this telling epic in American history.<br />Woodward has made a concerted effort to mainain a mostly objective and unbiased account of our prodigiously talented Commander in Chief, George W. Bush.  That being said, this book does skew towards the Left moreso than I would prefer.  All in all, worth a read for all who desire to delve deeper into the innerworkings of the White House.	2003-01-30

Hey, I was wrong.  Happily wrong at that.  Being a Republican and strong Bush supporter, I was looking for an unbiased insider account of the war on terror that would tell me the everyday goings-on and inner workings of the Bush Cabinet - not repeating insipid generalities and NOT doing it with a liberal bias.  Fighting Back is that book - and much, much more.  Although not a sappy liberal(and proudly so), I must admit that Sammon weaves this book so lucidly and so exquisitely that I even cried when Bush stepped up to the top of the demolished fire engine with Bob Beckwith using a rickety bullhorn and upon hearing the New Yorkers yell, \\"We can't hear you!\\" so aptly shouted, \\"I can hear YOU.  The rest of the world hears you.  And the people who knocked these buildings dwon will hear ALL of us soon!\\"  Bravo! Impromtu genius.  A defining moment in American history.<br />Bill Sammon, as Larry Kudlow said, wrote \\"an awfully good book.\\"  I couldn't agree more.  Not only does it let you in on info that only insiders would be privy to, it provides for a compelling and extremely well-written narrative that reads like a suspenseful novel - highly rare for this genre.  Sammon exposes the blaring propaganda and hypocrisy that the liberal media perpetuates to no end.  While exposing the divisive and self-serving nature of Hllary as she irreverently displays the New York Post headline \\"BUSH KNEW\\" only days after the attack, Sammon masterfully lets the reader in on the real George W. Bush.  From his propensity for nicknames for others(Stretch) to his uncanny ability to make the working class Joe feel at ease with him and actually understand his message(unlike the tawdry and pontificating rhetoric of Clinton), Bush has performed admirably in the face of disaster and unquestionably deserves our kudos, not unjustified criticism stemming from the liberal class warfare synonomous only to the Left.  Great read with shock value.  Not to be missed.<br />\\"Adversity introduces us to ourselves.\\" - George W. Bush	2003-01-25

The late Barbara Olson chronicles in expert fashion and honest conservative journalistic style the many horrific and unspeakable travesties perpetrated by Bill and Hillary at the tumultous conclusion to their 8 year co-presidency.  I read in horror and shock as the business partnership, not anything remotely resembling a couple, that is Bill and Hillary, or PLOTUS and FLOTUS as Barbara succintly refers to them as, time and time again committed heinous injustices.<br />\\"Not since the opening of the gates of the Bastille have so many criminals been liberated on a single day.\\"  On his infamous last day as Commander-in-Chief, Clinton granted 140 highly dubious pardons along with 36 commutations to bring to a deplorable record grand total of 450 for his tawdry tenure of depravity.  Olson masterfully documents the infamous Marc Rich as Clinton pardons the #6 Most Wanted Fugitive by the Justice Department saying that the biggest tax defrauder in U.S. history, who by the way had renounced his U.S. citizenship and was conveniently \\"living abroad\\" and whose ex-wife channeled countless donations and gifts to the Prez, was \\"wrongly indicted\\".<br />Among the shady and unscrupulous criminals pardoned were Bill's cocaine-snorting and habitually law-breaking half-brother Roger Clinton, as well as ex-lover Susan McDougal, drug king pins(whom Clinton had pledged to put away only 8 years ago apparently in meanignless campaign rhetoric, notorious cop killers, convicted anti-American terrorists, and a slew of other so-called unfairly indicted miscreants.  Olson tells of the ostensibly coincidental(as Hillary calls it) DNC, Senate, and Clinton Library contributions and gifts well in excess of a million dollars that were gratiously received by Bill and Hillary in exchange for the unethical and as if it matters to Bill - highly illegal as well -quid pro quo deals for immunity and pardons.  From the Secret Service's codename for Roger(Headache) to the White House Lawn Marines' refusal to right face when the draft-dodging, military-gutting Clinton walked past(and how they miraculously reconvened the first day of George W. Bush's tenure) are just a couple of the insider tidbits that the articulate and dearly missed Barbara Olson conveys to the reader in this entertaining and informative short read.  The benefits and knowledge of the real & unadulterated truth - the stuff the liberal media conveniently let slip through the cracks - proves worth the little time needed to read this compelling book.	2003-01-22

Like most of you, I have read Fight Club, Survivor, and Choke(planning on Invisible Monsters) and was eagerly anticipating Lullaby like a virgin on prom night.  I think fans of the visionary that is Chuck Palahniuk will enjoy this dark and esoteric, yet amusingly fun novel.  Perhaps those less versed in the original, sordid, and cynical prose of Chuck would be better served to commence the Palahniuk journey with the incomparable Fight Club.<br />While Lullaby is anything but pedantic and mundane literature, the character development was a bit lackluster and the storyline perhaps somewhat convoluted and unrealistic.  Having said that, I must admit that Lullaby was a compelling, if not bizarre read nonetheless.  One annoying anachronistic snafu that I must point out is how author Basil Frankie &quot;lifted off the Internet&quot; some of his material for his book Poems and Rhymes from Around the World - despite having written it 20 years ago.  That's about as likely as hell freezing over.  This group of eclectic and unendearing characters was by all means the weakest group written by Chuck thus far.  I recommend Lullaby for diehard Chuck fans like moi, but not for first-time readers.	2003-01-21

Scott was a mere 23 years of age, This Side of Paradise elevates itself as a seminal and ground-breaking semi-autobiographical novel that inexplicably remains vastly underappreciated as of today. Amory Blaine manifests himself as a veritable study of egotism, romanticism, idealism, and intense disillusionment. Amory proves to be an endearing and highly affable young protagonist. The prep school and Princeton years of supercilious and pretentious egotist hedonism abound immensely in energy, innocence, and vitality.<br />Through the despair of his failed love with Rosalind et al, his disenchantment with his advertsing job, and the inseparable gloom and despair of WWI, Amory enters into a reproachful state of disillusionment and cynicism subsequent to \\"The Great War\\". Fitzgerald, the acclaimed golden boy of his aptly named Jazz Age, emodies in Amory \\"a new generation grown up to find all Gods dead, all wars fought, all faiths in man shaken.\\"<br />Amory undergoes a catharsis of sorts in purging his tragic loss of innocence due to the war with his heavy drinking and nihilistic behavior. Nonetheless, he regains a semblance of his former confidence and intensity at the conclusion of the book, \\"yet the waters of disillusion had left a deposit on his soul.\\" Is Amory the same romantic egotist that we witnessed at the onset of this powerful work? Not by any stretch of the imagination. However, through his despondent adversity, his intellectualism survives as well as his somewhat frayed, yet repaired sense of hopeful idealisism for the future - whatever it may bring. A strikingly similar ending to Hemingway's later masterpiece The Sun Also Rises, n'est-ce pas?	2003-01-19

As luck would have it, I must say that I came away not only pleasantly surprised, but rather impressed with junior's ability to weave a tale that kept me enthralled from page 1.  For those people who can appreciate a highly compelling and entertaining historical novel - a la The Killer Angels & Blackhawk Down - then order Gods and Generals.<br />Shaara takes you through the tumultuous ups and downs of the first three years of the Civil War, through the many inept Union commanders from McDowell to Meade, through the bloody and tide-turning Confederate victories from Manassas to Chancellorsville while all the while keeping the reader in suspense and anxious for the next impending big battle. Shaara's gift is that of bringing his characters to life and thus endearing them to his reader - from the God-fearing and charismatic Stonewall Jackson to the tough and resilient Winfield Scott Hancock. I am eagerly anticipating the movie and highly recommend Gods and Generals to those who enjoyed the seminal and ground-breaking work The Killer Angels as well as those who are keen on military history.	2003-01-13

It can be argued that Iago was unduly wronged in that the noble &amp; educated, yet untested Cassio achieved the promotion of lieutenant over the common &amp;  uneducated, yet more battle-proven Iago.  Iago also asserts that his blunt and disrespectful wife Emilia has slept around and made a cuckold of him with Othello.  Although there is no proof as to the latter charge, Iago is nothing short of the embodiment of a veritable myriad of rage, fury, jealousy, and a relentless and all-encompassing passion for vengeance on The Moor.<br />Upon reading Othello the first time, I found myself empathizing with the honorable, yet naive General Othello, and even moreso with the innocent and untainted Desdemona, whom Othello &quot;loved not wisely, but too well.&quot;  After reading Othello the 3rd time, I've come to a greater appreciation for the convoluted and diablolical genius that is Iago - and how masterfully Shakespeare constructed this great character and the storyline of Othello with so fewer characters than is typical of his other great plays.  It is with fewer characters that the ingenuity of Shakespeare is allowed to shine.  With the likes of Iago, The Bard is able to achieve as great and superior characterization in Othello as in any of his other masterpieces.  While he may be the last guy on the block you might invite to dinner, you would be a knave to  deny the incomparable surreptitious cunning and genius of Iago nonetheless.  As far as the many Othello movies go, I must state that Kenneth Branagh is absolutely masterful and convincing as the sinister Iago.  I wholeheartedly recommend Othello to any and all readers who have a flair for both wisdom and entertainment achieved as one.	2003-01-11

Although in some respects it is similar to its predecessor, Antony & Cleopatra, having been written by Shakespeare much later in life after the tragic death of his lone son Hamnet and a turbulent relationship with his wife, brings forth a much more cynical and wily Bard than the young and idealistic one who wrote Caesar. This disillusionment can be witnessed not only in the tragic deaths of Antony and Cleopatra, but moreso subvertly in the incongruity and disingenuousness of their supposed driving impetus - their love for one another. Both Antony & Cleopatra continuously and almost purposefully betray each other throughout the play - undermining their ability to lead and therefore leading to their tragic and untimely demise.<br />I recommend this to those who adored Julius Caesar as well as those Shakespeare aficionados who simply cannot get enough of The Bard.  Antony & Cleopatra proves a lucid, enjoyable, and easy read, although somewhat longer, but with less substance than Julius Caesar.  Enjoyable nonetheless.<br />\\"Make not your thoughts your prisons.\\"  - Octavius Caesar	2003-01-06

Written by Shakespeare for Queen Elizabeth I amidst a time of Irish rebellion, Henry V more than adequately serves its intended purpose of galvanizing nationalistic fervor.  It proved itself to be an unwavering and unfaltering impetus of patriotism in Shakespeare's day, during WWII, and still today it continues to resonate and reverberate this provocatively telling tale of the most gloriously revered monarch in English history.<br />Henry V's stirring orations prior to the victorious battles of Harfleur(&quot;Once more unto the breach&quot;) and Agincourt(&quot;We few, we happy few, we band of brothers&quot;) astonish and inspire me every time I read them.  Simply amazing.  Having read Henry IV Parts I&amp;II beforehand, I was surprised Shakespeare failed to live up to his word in the Epilogue of Part II in which he promised to &quot;continue the story, with Sir John in it.&quot;  The continuing follies of the conniving Bardolph, Nym, &amp; Pistol and their ignominious thieving prove to be somewhat of a depricating underplot which nevertheless proves to act as a succinct metaphor for King Harry's &quot;taking&quot; of France.<br />Powerful and vibrant, the character of Henry V evokes passion and unadulterated admiration through his incredible valor &amp; strength of conviction in a time of utter despondency.  It is this conviction and passion which transcends time, and moreover, the very pages that Shakespeare's words are written upon.  I find it impossible to overstate the absolute and impregnable puissance of Henry V, a play which I undoubtedly rate as the obligatory cream of the crop of Shakespeare's Histories.  I recommend reading Henry IV I&amp;II prior to Henry V as well as viewing Kenneth Branagh's masterpiece film subsequent to reading the equally moving work.	2002-12-21

Having said that, I found Part II to be enjoyable, yet perhaps leaving something to be desired - like more action.  Falstaff and Prince Hal both come off as somewhat disingenuous and calculating Machiavellian individuals.  Disappointingly, Falstaff speaks poorly of Prince Hal while unwittingly in his midst.  Conversely, The Prince of Wales prematurely takes the crown before his King Henry IV's death as well as disassociating himself with Falstaff after he is crowned King.  These instances, along with others throughout the play, show the self-serving tendencies of both characters.<br />However, we can proudly witness the maturation of the young King from wild & dissolute young Prince Hal into one of the most revered monarchs in English history, King Henry V.  Part II remains an intriguing play due to its paradoxical nature, yet unfortunately rarely acted out today.  Now that I have read Henry IV(I&II) for the first time, I gladly move on to one of my personal favorites, Henry V.  I recommend both parts(Folger editions) for all Shakespeare enthusiasts - they have given me greater insight into the young Henry V - when he was more concerned with downing a pint of ale rather than downing the French at Agincourt.<br />2 Magnificent Quotes from Henry IV Part II -<br />\\"Uneasy lies the head that wears a crown.\\" - King Henry IV<br />\\"He hath eaten me out of house and home.\\" - Mistress Quickly	2002-12-16

Having just completed Henry IV Part I, I must say that I came away delighted and impressed with Shakespeare's genius once again. Shakespeare's ability to intertwine the arduous dichotomy of the impcomparable comedy of Falstaff and the meaningful history of Henry IV, Prince Hal, & Hotspur is impressive to say the least. It comes as no surprise that this was one of Shakespeare's most popularly staged plays during his day and enjoyed an unusually long stage run.<br />Falstaff is undoubtedly the most infamously famous literary comic character in the history of English literature. The scenes of him being robbed by Prince Hal, feigning his death, stabbing the already deceased Hotspur in the leg while claiming victory, and his employment of beggars as his foot soldiers galvanize the comic aspect of the play and make for a hilarious & farcical sublot. Interestingly, in the bar in Eastcheap, Prince Hal alludes to his future persecution of Falstaff when he is crowned king.<br />I strongly recommend Henry IV Part I to all Shakespeare aficionados seeing as I deem it in the top five of all Shakespeare's works along with Hamlet, Julius Caesar, Macbeth, & Henry V.

Hamlet proves to be a masterpiece of masterpieces -a shining paradigm of unparalleled magnificence unlike any other play ever written.  I thoroughly enjoyed Julius Caesar, Othello, Macbeth, Henry V, The Merchant of Venice, Much Ado About Nothing, Romeo & Juliet, The Tempest, etc.<br />Nonetheless, I unquestionably rate Hamlet as Shakespeare's crowning achievement - his magnum opus.<br />Hamlet proves to be a prodigiously powerful and profoundly potent play incredibly chock-full of amazing quotes and axioms that I memorize and incorporate into everyday life - from Polonius's sanctimonious speeches spoken to Laertes and Ophelia(\\"To thine own self be true\\") to Marcellus(\\"Something is rotten in the state of Denmark\\") to of course the avenger himself Prince Hamlet(\\"Frailty, thy name is woman!\\").<br />Although Hamlet's faults of inaction, procrastination, and paradoxical impetuosity preclude our protagonist from overcoming his impending and unalterable doom, I unavoidably empathize with him and his inevitable plight. Hamlet is grievously wronged by so many in his life - his uncle Claudius, his mother Gertrude, his love Ophelia, the ostensibly wise Polonius, shamefully by his traitorous \\"friends\\" Rosencrantz & Guildenstern, and lastly by his murderous foil(no pun intended)Laertes. The undeniable central theme of uncontrollable fatalism pervades throughout Hamlet. I felt as if Hamlet was on an unstoppable one way train going 200 miles/hour straight into a brick wall. Sadly, he knows he shall soon meet his untimely demise as he picks up his foil to fight Laertes.  Fittingly, the victorious young Fortinbras proves to personify what could have and should have become of our tragically departed hero.<br />To be read time and time again - even if just for the supremely witty quotes.  Recommended AFTER reading: Kenneth Branagh or Laurence Olivier's film versions - both long, but undeniably superb.	2002-12-03

It is no surprise that The Merry Wives of Windsor enjoyed such a long and successful stage run during Shakespeare's day and continues to be one of his most popularly staged plays.

His positivity and sense of humor shine throughout this free-spirited, innovative, & unrestricted stream of consciousness autobiographical landmark novel. Inspiring and refreshing it is that Miller maintains his positvity despite being in the midst of The Great Depression and living a desperate and destitute existence at times throughout the novel.<br />Having read Miller's fellow expatriate Hemingway, I liken Tropic of Cancer to The Sun Also Rises - albeit as an NC-17 version. I found Tropic of Cancer to be highly compelling reading despite its lack of structure and organization. This book, above any other, makes me yearn to be a writer. I admire Miller - not for his nihilistic and chaotic lifestyle - but for his ingenuity, his passion for his writing, and his resiliency which allowed him to write such an uncompromising work under no paramaters or publisher constraints whatsoever - which would go on to influence many future writers as well as serve as the blueprint for the autobiographical novel. Si vous pouvez lire francais, c'est tres utile pour ce livre.<br />I ordered Tropic of Cancer to see what all of the fuss was about - and I wasn't disappointed. This is truly an underrated novel and understandably one that is primarily read for pleasure as opposed to assigned class reading - definitely not one for Billy Bob and Sue Ann in high school. I've never met anyone who has read this book and those who know about it refer to it as \\"trashy\\". Oftentimes perception becomes reality, but not here. It is sometimes sick and perverted & sometimes nasty(the ubiquity of the lice and roaches is enticing). But, overall it is Miller's infectious enthusiasm and overwhelming love of life(and women) that inspires and invigorates the soul. I recommend Tropic to anyone who is in need of a literature experience that will prove anything but ordinary.	2002-12-01

I had read similar books containing a highly disenchanted and disjointed protagonist such as A Clockwork Orange and Fight Club(both excellent works). However, The Stranger, albeit a short work, adds more fuel to the fire of disillusionment in the person of the enigmatic and mysterious Meursault. Camus galvanizes this novella noir with his uncanny use of existentialism to bring attention to the smells, sights, and sounds of the beach and the countryside and Meursault's oneness with nature and conversely his nothingness with God.<br />The Stranger proves incredibly unconventional and simple, yet paradoxically complex and compelling. There are times when I wanted to shake the catatonic Meursault and shout, \\"Wake up!!\\" It seems as if he's almost stoically sleepwalking through life and his highly questionable decisions. He proves totally devoid of conscience and emotion - enigmatic and remorseless to the end. Worth a read - unlike any other work of fiction you will ever read.	2002-11-28

Three hours is all we ask - read it and you will laugh at the insane, idiotic, and birdbrained agenda(or lack thereof) of the Democrats as Sean eloquently and intelligently gives example after example of the unspeakable hypocrisy and lack of political direction of the Democratic leadership such as Gephardt, Daschle, Moynahan, Gore, Hillary and Bill, et al.<br />Hannity brings to light the utter lunacy of Clinton's refusal to bring Osama bin Laden into custody when given the chance.  I must admit that I learned quite a bit of knowledge about politics and the incessant waffling that goes on with the likes of Daschle and Gephardt on the topics of abortion, home defense, and tax cuts.  Can't Democrats understand that we are the most neddlessly overtaxed nation on the face of the Earth and Bush's tax cuts provide a much needed shot in the arm and an economic stimulus that historically proves beneficial to not only the rich, but the poor as well? This book is one that I proudly display on my bookshelf and one that can be referenced anytime a liberal Democrat leftist pundit weakly confronts me with their mindless, ambivalent, and wavering Leftist agenda of Big Government not of the people, for the people, or by the people.	2002-11-25

It is, as Beatrice would say, &quot;as merry as the day is long.&quot;  I personally enjoyed the wit and cynicism of Benedick and Beatrice in particular as well as the complete and utter chaos concerning Hero and Claudio's proposed union that ensues due to the chicanery and wickedness of the Machiavellian, Iago-like Don John.<br />The thematic dichotomy of marriage and misogyny resonates throughout the entire play.  Much Ado shrilly reverberates in today's society as marriage has become a feared and loathed institution by many as we look at our mates with increased scepticism of the other's fidelity with the comical fear of being made a cuckhold and having the infamous horns grown on our heads.  Shakespeare makes this serious theme into a witty and enjoyable comedy: one that ranks at #4 on my Comedy list - just below The Comedy of Errors, The Merchant of Venice, &amp; The Taming of the Shrew.  A must read for all Shakespeare aficionados - BEFORE seeing the movie.	2002-11-25

The valiant never taste of death but once.\\" - Caesar<br />Just one of the many brilliant quotes from this powerful and enduring tragedy, which happens to be amongst my very favorite Shakespeare. How could anyone not enjoy Marc Antony swaying the weak-minded and feeble-minded plebians with his vibrant and rousing speech? Julius Caesar is unquestionably quintessential Shakespeare, a monumental work that perhaps is surpassed only by Hamlet and rivaled by Othello, Macbeth, Romeo & Juliet, & King Lear.<br />Julius Caesar teaches us about the dangers and pitfalls of ambition, jealousy, power, as well as the sacrifice for the greater good - even if it is another's life. Amongst the bood-thirsty traiotors, only Brutus genuinely believes in the assassination of Caesar for the greater good of the Republic. Julius Caesar galvanizes the brain and awakens the spirit from within with scenes such as when Marc Antony proclaims, \\"Cry Havoc and let slip the dogs of war.\\"<br />Countless amounts of quotes and passages throughout the play rank among my favorite Shakespeare. Needless to say, this book should be on the bookshelf of any and all with any semblance of intellect and enough cultivation to appreciate such superb literature.<br />The modern perspective following the text enlightens and should be read by anyone seeking more knowledge about this amazing tragedy and time in history.

Antipholus of Syracuse and his long lost twin Antipholus of Ephesus along with the two twin servants Dromio of Ephesus and Syracuse become unceasingly mistaken for each other making for a hilarious and entertaining farce of a play.<br />The Comedy of Errors has been copied many times since in literature, movies, & sitcoms, although it has never been duplicated.	2002-11-01

All of this embodies their escape from both reality and confrontation into their ostensibly safe glass houses: a very deluded 1734, a mental hospital where all is not as it seems, a multitude of unsuspecting restaurants, and the innumerable sex spots for Victor - all of which provide a supposed safe haven from the heartless and cruel real world. Palahniuk advances many themes throughout Choke, not the least of which mandates not to escape from reality, but instead to create your own new reality.

You talk about an enigmatic protagonist - Tender Branson is inscrutable, mysterious, overly subservient, bizarre, solitary, gloomy, alienated, and yet somehow an endearing central character that I strangely enough rooted for .<br />Having just read Breakfast of Champions by Vonnegut just prior to Survivor, I drew many parallels between the two masters of sardonic, sordid satire inundated with hilarious black humor in these two great works - overrampant consumerism, commercialism, materialism, conformity to the point where Americans have become sickeningly servile programmed robots sorely lacking in inventiveness and creativity, a surpressed ability to act on one's own without the instruction or approval of others, as well as the escalating degradation of moral values.

Although not on the Pulitzer Prize winning level of its predecessor, Primary Colors provides for biting political satire and insight as well as just pure entertainment.

I read an interview with Ellis where he stated that The Informers was merely a collection of short stories he had been working on for years in between novels when he had writer's block that were basically turned in to satisfy a publishing deadline - he did not expect them to ultimately to be approved for publishing.<br />Now I know why, Bret.  Somewhat enjoyable and recommended strictly for diehard Ellis fans.

The totally unoriginal name for Barry's band made me laugh out loud seeing as it fit with his obtuse character - Barrytown. \\"Be afraid. Be very afraid.

I felt as if I were alive right there in Gettysburg as an omnipresent bystander witnessing the greatest and most momentous battle ever fought on American soil.  Thanks to the amazing character development and extraordinary description and dialogue, I came to know the heroic Joshua Chamberlain, the intrepid George Pickett, the indecisive Richard Ewell, the gruff James Longstreet, and of course the revered Robert E.

So I decided to read it and came away plesantly surprised.  It's laconic, short, dark, and undoubtedly a ground-breaking novella.  This is the bad boy that started the whole roman noir and existentialism genre back in 1934.  Albert Camus, the author credited with fully developing existentialism and the depiction of characters devoid of conscious, credited Cain as his inspiration for his very similar masterpiece, The Stranger, after having read The Postman.<br />The two leading enigmatic characters, Frank and Cora, as does Meursault in The Stranger, assume ultimate responsibility for their heinous acts of free will without any knowledge of what is right or wrong or good or bad.  Being a novel noir genre fan, I recommend the once-banned Postman to anyone who has the stomach for some mild eroticism, violence, and moreover, clever writing.	2002-10-08

This is the novel that established Hemingway as a genius and as the voice of the Lost Generation subsequent to \\"The War To End All Wars.\\"<br />What makes this my favorite Hemingway and one of my all-time favs is Hemingway's amazing use of dialogue - unparalleled in American literature. The many drunken conversations between the morally devoid, yet likable characters Brett, Jake, and the gang are entertaining and extremely well-written.<br />The Sun Also Rises brilliantly captures the intense disillusionment, aloofness, nihilism, and detachment of Hemingway's Lost Generation from American mainstream society resulting from the horrors and emptiness of WWI.	2002-10-08

Lolita's premise proves to be that of insane &amp; perverse debauchery, yet nonetheless the prose which so aptly packages it demonstrates such skill in a crazily calm manner.  Nabokov unequivocally substantiates his high praise as well-deserved with his rich use of symbolism, imagery, and his extensive use of the French language - all of which I enjoyed and appreciated.  Having said that, I became somewhat disenchanted with the redundant subject matter of Humbert incessantly obsessing with 12 year-old Lolita throughout the entire novel with little character development of Lolita whatsoever.  To say the non-stop use of the words &quot;nymphet&quot; and &quot;pubescent&quot; on every single page became trite and exceedingly annoying would be to put it lightly.

He asks the reader to ponder the unsymbiotic dichotomy of beauty and goodness.  Can one possess both while maintaining a clear conscience?<br />As for the irrepressible and intrepidly narcissistic Dorian Gray, \\"I admit that I think that it is better to be beautiful than to be good.\\" The Picture of Dorian Gray is a short work of literature that I read in one day. However, its brevity is due to Wilde's publisher purposefully omitting material at the time that was deemed vile and unprintable. This causes some holes in the story - references made to the many sins Dorian committed along the way to others were left unanswered upon finishing the book. More than a little frustrating. Having said that, I was pleasantly surprised with the Gothic, sordid, and dark themes that Wilde so aptly transcribes. Wilde amuses us with the copious amounts of witty quotable lines from Lord Henry such as, \\"The only way to get rid of a temptation is to yield to it.\\"<br />I found myself writing down clever witticisms constantly as I read the book.

During the beginning, there is little or no character development.  In fact, I was hoping someone or something would jump out of \\"the heart of darkness\\" and kill them all - they were unendearing and useless simpletons.  Having said that, Conrad punches through the uqiquitous, lugubrious(a word he used entirely too much), morose, and morbid fog that permeates the heart of darkness on the Congo as well as the metaphorical heart of darkness residing in the inscrutable and mysterious Mr. Kurtz to provide a meaningful and strong finale.

The two migratory ranch hands exchange entertaining back and forth dialogue that only Steinbeck could produce, himself having toiled many long days and hours on California farms and ranches. Through all of their adversity, Lenny and George tragically cling to that which we all do at some point, the American Dream - theirs being \\"to live off the fatta the lan' an' have rabbits.\\" Although not on the same Pulitzer Prize level(but what is?) of The Grapes of Wrath, Of Mice and Men manifests itself as the classic paradoxical tale of hope and despair not to be overlooked.	2002-09-21

Glamorama is chock-full of cool soundbites from Victor Ward, the not so humble narrator, \\"I'm a bad boy.  I'm a legend.  But in reality everything's a big world party and there are no VIP rooms.\\"  Glamorama is Bret Easton Ellis's longest novel, but it flows so effortlessly due to the lucid and outrageous dialogue that I didn't mind.  We follow Victor Ward, a spoiled 26 year old \\"victim\\" of upper class society on his quest of nihilism as he gets laid early and often by beautiful model/actresses such as Chloe, Allison, and Jamie and as he works out with Reed, his personal trainer, in search of perfect abs, as he pops Xanex after Xanex incessantly, and as he binge drinks Cosmopolitans and snorts coke until wasted into oblivion.  As a t-shirt he wears back at Camden states, \\"If you're not wasted, the day is.\\"  As Victor would retort, \\"Spare me.\\"<br />I thought the first four tiers of Glamorama were superb, witty, and pure original prose as only Bret Easton Ellis can deliver.

The fine line between that which is real and that which is imagined becomes inexorably blurred in this gripping one of a kind thriller.  As I followed the tale of the mysterious Opera Ghost(as he's referred to), the lovestruck Raoul le Vicomte de Chagny, Count Philippe, The Persian, Carlotta, and the beautiful chanteuse Christine Daa&eacute; I found myself eneveloped into this marvelous tale and unsure of exactly what was real and what was merely an illusion.<br />With the bizarre and inexplicable untimely deaths, premature resignation of its managers, the cavernous cellar and deadly lake, the infamous Box 5, the innumerable trap doors, unusual &quot;accidents&quot; and strange goings-on, the Paris Opera House manifests itself into a most paradoxical setting where the line between reality and illusion is inexplicably altered.  Considering these events supposedly occurred around 1881 in Paris, it made this suspenseful tale all the more enjoyable.  I could not put the book down and liken it to the genre of Edgar Allen Poe.  Once you open The Phantom of the Opera, prepare to enter into the Paris Opera House and into a sublime world unlike any other.	2002-09-13

That ostensibly sums up the intriguing philosophy of Willie Stark, the Huey Long-modeled demagogue protagonist.  All the King's Men follows the political career of country boy Willie Stark - from a small fry County Treasurer known as \\"Cousin Willy\\" all the way to Louisiana Governor referred to simply as \\"The Boss\\".  The reader follows Willie undergo a transformation from a young, naive, idealist politician who despises corruption into a hardened, cynical machine politician who will use any means necessary to aid his poor and disenfranchised constituents - all the while helping himself as well as the cronies of his machine.<br />But this is not entirely about Willie Stark.  It is beautifully written in 1st person narrative as told by Stark's right hand man, Jack Burden, a man facing many struggles of his own.  Throughout the book, Jack's inward struggle with morality parallels Willie's outward struggle with his actions and their moral repercussions.  Both Jack and Willie believe the paradoxical philosophy that \\"you had to make the good out of the bad because there wasn't anything else to make it out of.\\"  At the end they both undergo an epiphany of sorts as Jack starts a clean new life and rids himself of all the residue of his corruption while Willie states on his deathbed, \\"It might have been different, Jack.  You got to believe that.\\"<br />Winner of the Pulitzer Prize in 1946, All the King's Men is a masterpiece and is unequivocally the best politcal novel ever written.  Having said that, it is not a classic to put on your bookshelf as a trophy and let collect dust.  It is a book to be treasured and referenced early and often for its wisdom, which resonates as strongly today as at its first printing.	2002-09-10

The irrepressible Joad family takes an unforgettable journey west to the promised land of California from their bank-confiscated farm in desolate Oklahoma.  Steinbeck utilizes the setting of the Great Depression to the fullest through his vivid imagery of the colors of grey and red, his naturalism, which makes the land a character in its own right, his transcendentalism and symbolism, both which bring ulterior meaning to many seemingly mundane goings-on throughout The Grapes of Wrath.<br />Steinbeck brings to life characters that I empathize for and felt after 200 pages as if I were a member of their family rooting them on after all they had persevered through.  The struggle of the Joads to put food on their plates at the end of the night after picking cotton or peaches all day long for next to nothing makes me extremely thankful to have food and shelter -things most of us take for granted.  The Joads struggle for their place in society and for their identity, which was unconscionably taken away from them and thousands of other &quot;Okies&quot;.  The Joad family undergoes a stark transformation from naive idealists to destitute pessimists and finally back to optimistic and hopeful for the future.  Te Grapes of Wrath proves to be the definitive novel of the Great Depression and one that every American should read in order to fully understand the most apocalyptic time in American history and fully appreciate our lives today and the many luxuries that we all take for granted.  Undoubtedly one of the top 5 American novels of all time.	2002-09-10

His message - we think we own our posessions, job, and lifestyle, but in reality, they own us.<br />Anyone who needs a wake up call that will make you rethink your life's priorities, order Fight Club.

That's what I kept thinking to myself as I was reading Fear and Loathing  - and laughing like mad at the same time.<br />I read Fear and Loathing over the weekend and came away enlightened and entertained.  As someone who isn't into drugs, I can safely say from the devil's advocate point of view that Fear and Loathing is not just some meaningless drug propoganda that is for slackers and degenerates.  When I told others I was reading Fear and Loathing, they all seemed shocked and incredulous and went on to say how they had heard how it's a \\"drug book\\".<br />Ladies and gents, for those of you that are so close-minded and PC to think that - you are the exact conformist, obtuse, and sanctimonious individuals that fail to grasp the genius of Hunter S. Thompson.<br />Chase the American Dream with Hunter S. Thompson's alterego, Raoul Duke and his out to lunch attorney, Dr. Gonzo and you will come away with an expanded mindset.  Thompson, through all of his wacky and wild dialogue, brings to light the ending of the American Dream at the end of the 60's with the election of Nixon.  The drug-induced paranoia and insanity of the Duke and Gonzo likens evolves as a direct metaphor of what the Nixon administration brought upon the whole of America in what Thompson calls \\"The foul year of our Lord, 1971\\".<br />\\"In a closed society where everybody's guilty, the only crime is getting caught.\\"	2002-08-28

The Guide entertained me with its humorous, gut wrenching absurdity while educating me with its witty dialogue and sardonic social satire. The election of the nihilistic puppethead president Zaphod Beeblebrox pokes fun at the very hypocrisy that is politics.<br />A great, quick read that will leave an indelible impression - and leave your sides hurting from laughing so much.<br />\\"Does it really, cosmically speaking, matter if I don't get up and go to work?\\"	2002-08-27

The book was a normal coming of age type book for the first 100 pages, and then all of a suddent Esthter talks of the 19 razors blades she keeps in her purse, and then the entire premise of the novel deepened tenfold and took an unforgettable 180 degree turn into the enigmatic bell jar. When she vividly imagines slitting her wrists I felt nauseous and about to puke wanting to throw the book down. Needless to say, I really got into the novel and the characters -undoubtedly because they're all real people in Plath's life... This classic is deeply disturbing, yet refreshingly redeeming & reinvigorating.<br />FYI: A must read - not just for chics.	2002-08-25

Having seen the movie and loved it, I was anticipating of course exactly what I had seen in the movie with somewhat more detail and character development. What I uncovered was much, much more. Ellis brings the enigmatic and mysterious Patick Bateman(whom I liken remotely to Jay Gatsby) to life as an embittered entity centered around self-indulgence, nihilism and narcicism. Bateman's alterego says and acts on things that many of us think, but would never dream of actually participating in.<br />FYI - American Psycho is indoubtedly not for the squemish or anyone who is even remotely PC. In other words, if you are a self-righteous charlatan, you need not read this. I laughed out loud on numerous occasions at the absurdity of the supercilious characters. Having said that, I cringed during the explicitly graphic and detailed sex scenes, sadistic torture acts, and the nauseous execution-style murders.<br />Why I am I giving this a 5 Star Rating you may ask? Simple, no modern author has both the combination of balls and writing ability to put on paper anything remotely as original as American Psycho. Although esoteric and not for everyone, American Psycho entertains and educates those who are willing to go along for the exhilirating ride.	2002-08-23

That Joyce quote from Portrait sums up not only my philosophy, but that of Steven Dedalus, Joyce's enigmatic protagonist as well. We see Steven through the eyes of the 3rd person narrator in this provocative, semi-autobiographical coming of age tale set in Ireland.<br />Joyce delves deep into many of life's questions that we all wonder about, mostly subconsciously. It is an allegorical tale of art and morality and a choice to be made between the two. Steven's strict Catholic school is the focus early on as Steven is faced with temptations and faces the aftermath of his transgressions. Steven then moves on to the university and evolves into an adult. At this point I became enthralled with the depth of the prose and finally bought into why this book came so highly acclaimed. The drunken conversations among Steven and Cranly & his college buds stimulates the mind as they delve deep into God's existence and how to achieve the greatest possible happiness for the greatest possible number of people. Don't be discouraged by a slow start - Joyce packs his most potent punch in Chapter 3 and on. Cheers.	2002-08-14

My sentiments exactly - spoken by Dr. Stubbs of Yossarian, the prodigious, yet pugnacious protagonist. In a paradoxical world, where the supposedly sane commanding officers run the miltary through methodical madness, the \\"crazy\\" Yossarian is deemed so because he values self-preservation over death.<br />The military brass in Catch-22 proves not only utterly pretentious, incomptetent, indolent, and inept, but incongruously insane themselves. General P.P. Peckem ostentatiously states, \\"My only fault\\", he pauses for effect,\\"is that I have no faults.\\" General Peckem is only one of the many well-developed laughable characters developed throughout Catch-22. The general pedestrian reader might say that this is solely another \\"anti-war\\" book. I think that would be shallow and inaccurate as Catch-22 is much, much more than that. To me, Catch-22 sparks many thoughts and feelings concerning individuality vs. the system(and the Syndicate) and the willingness of one person in a sea of conformity to have the balls to stand up for what is right regardless what the consequences may be.	2002-07-29

I read it in 2 days and will never forget it!  This book has the power to change your life as it has mine.  You must go into the book with an open mind and be willing to read between the lines as there is much depth and symbolism within the humor and drama.<br />Kesey, before he began his acid road trip as detailed in Tom Wolfe's Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test, wrote this gem which focuses on the classic struggle between conformity and individuality, between good and evil, and tests the limits of sanity and insanity.  Anyone who needs a shove telling them to stand up for themselves and what they believe in despite the overwhelming invisible forces of conformist society should read this ASAP.  1st person narration from the rather unique perspective of a dillusional 6 foot 8 Columbian-Indian, Chief Bromden, or Chief Broom as the orderlies refer to him as, who pretends to be deaf and dumb, makes the read flow smoothly.<br />Although not for the politically correct or faint of heart, this esoteric novella enlightens and entertains throughout the whole ride and shows why it's a timeless classic.  It's in my top 5 best books of all time - period.  Check it out - it will leave an indelible impression.	2002-07-24

It's amazing Stephen Crane wrote this at 21 and died 7 short years later. His descriptive imagery is amazing. This is much, much more than just another war book.

I felt as if I were there on the battlefield in Fleming's shoes...Should I run or should I fight?...what would you do? Fleming fights not only the rebel army, but himself as well.<br />The hardback edition is absolutely fantastic...it includes the entire text - unlike the little short abridged version - and it includes a brilliant 50 page intro by Shelby Foote as well as \\"The Veteran\\" and valuable literary criticism after the text. 1st Class!	2002-07-20

Arthur Miller touches on so many themes and in turn touched my heart at the same time. After reading the back cover of the book, I was anticipating a shallow and predictable anti-semitism novel. I mean, how can one man's glasses a book make, right? Wrong...<br />Anyone who has ever felt alienated for any reason can empathize with Lawrence Newman, the Christian protagonist, who attempts to no end to conform to his antisemitic neighbors' absurd standards, but to no avail. His boss orders him to purchase glasses due to his myopia(irony indeed) and then his perfect world turns upside down as he himself is branded as \\"looking Jewish\\" by his neighbors, his boss, and even his mother. He is poked, prodded and pushed to the brink.<br />William H. Macy is perfect for the role of Newman.
