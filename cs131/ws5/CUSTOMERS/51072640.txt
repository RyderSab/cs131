The Quiet Time Companion uses several different approaches to freshen up personal study times.  Weekly sessions may study a single passage, a character, or a word.  Other sessions will look at the same passage from several different perspective or will spend two or more weeks on an indepth study of a section of scripture.<br />This multi-themed approach keeps your Bible study from becoming routine.  You will not find a three month study of Leviticus. It cuts down on the theological/philosophic mumbo-jumbo giving straight but not dumbed down look at the Word of God.<br />Another innovative approach the authors used in creating this devotional aid is that the weekly sessions are composed of 5 lessons, giving you 2 days of individual study (the authors do make some suggestions) but this is an excellent opportunity to work in preparing your Sunday School lesson during the weekend personalized study.<br />The authors are to be commended!  Bravo!	2000-12-31

The New American Standard Bible (NASB) is an excellent one.   Like the King James Version this is a word-for-word translation rather than  a meaning-by-meaning translation (Today's English Version) or a blend of  the two (New International Version or New Jerusalem Version), providing the  most accurate translation available.<br />The &quot;gift&quot; version of the  NASB I am reviewing (the burgendy hard cover) is much more of a pew Bible  than a gift Bible.  It has the look and feel of an old-fashioned, hardback  book, and is easily transportable.  <br />The only drawback to this version  that I have detected is a minor one:  the red lettering is off center with  the black lettering on pages where the two are combined.	2000-05-29

Regrettably, Edgar Lee Masters would not be on many of those lists.<br />It is a shame  because Spoon River Anthology is such an American collection of poems.   Masters is as a poet, what Norman Rockwell is as a painter:  a man who  captured the spirit of America.  An exercise in Americana? Undoubtedly.   But Master's is not whose eye were blind to the faults and foibles of  America.<br />His America, embodied in Spoon River, IL, is an America with  faults, with problems; it is at the same time an America with hope with a  future and at its core--a basically good nation.<br />If for no other reason,  I am an advocate of Masters because he is the poet who made me fall in love  with poetry.	2000-05-29

Stephanie is working to secure the election of a &quot;family values&quot;  candidate who would drive the coffin nail into ills such as assisted  suicide, gay rights, and abortion.<br />Jon Van Horn is working at chaning the  heart, by staying rooted in his inner-city school where he can make a  difference, by demonstarting God's compassion and love with action and not  by legislative mandates.<br />The thrust of the book is it takes both-   Compassion  and Justice-to make a difference.<br />And with all due respect to  the previous reviewer, Josh McDowell is no enemy to intellectualism.

But what was the deal:  I who have read Molire in the original, who correspond with actual Frenchmen in their language (without-I might  boast-sounding like a dolt), and who reads ParisMatch with no problem was  staring at the sentences on AOL's French Chat as if they  were...well...written in a foreign language.  &quot;Es-tu MEC?&quot;  Am I  a Mec.  What the heck is a mec?  My very good French English dictionary  was very bad at helping me comprehending the more trendy words.  So I was  left scrambling to get my hands on a very good dictionary of French Slang  dictionary. This book is it.  The dictionary begins with a quasi-scholarly  assessment of slang then moves on to a standard A to Zed listings of French  slang words.  Each word is given with a &quot;dictionary&quot; definition  and its slang renderings are given in the examples sentences.  These  example sentences, by the way, are excellent.  They are not the namby-pamby  sentences of first-year text books.  Instead they have a very &quot;real  life&quot; feel to them giving a sense on how to employ the slang word in  original speech or writing.  That said, there are several considerations  about the dictionary worth mentioning.  First it is a one-way dictionary.  (French-English only).  So that you can look up a slang word you've  encountered, but you're stuck rendering &quot;She puked her guts out&quot;  as &quot;Elle a beaucoup vomi&quot; until you happen across the French  slangs equivalents.   Secondly, there is no pronunciation guide at all.   The book assumes you can pronounce never-seen-before words.   Finally,  this is not one for the kiddies.  As a good deal of slang revolves around  sexual concepts so does a good portion of dictionary deal with  &quot;dirty&quot; words.  These words cover the gambit from crude, risqu,  to down right vulgarities.   This book is a good first step if you want  to move beyond a textbookvocabulary.  And PLEASE have at least textbook  vocabulary to begin with.  Slang is  slippery enough in one's own language.   To memorize slang expressions without a broader understanding of French as  a whole could have you sounding like a misplaced hippy or worse... like  Pauley Shore.	2000-05-02

They also define each of the five points of Calvinism two ways positively  (explaining what Calvinists believe about the doctrine) and negatively  (explaining how it is not Arminianism) and conclude each section with an  extensive biblical citations.<br />What the book does not do, however, is  reconcile those passages in Scripture that causes problems for Calvinism  such as Titus 2:11 &quot;For the grace of God that bringeth salvation hath  appeared to every man.&quot;  or Heb. 2:9 &quot;that he [Christ] should  taste death for every man.&quot;	2000-03-31

Hey, lets face it--if you  don't know what a dialogu box is you don't need to even THINK about  programming a Mac.<br />When the book does get around to discussing C code --  in chapter 17 (3/4 of the way through the book) -- it quickly becomes  evident that are not learning code to form your own program, you are  learning how to make minor changes in the code the author already created.

The editors  have wisely decided to let the photographs themselves serve as a visual  commentary.<br />I had intended to give the book as a gift for my wife, but  when I took the book out of the box I started browsing through it and  became so obsorbed by the book, my wife came home from work while I was  still reading it and before I had a chance to hide it.<br />So, two weeks  early, it has been on the coffee table.  With the holidays coming on, there  have been many visitors to the house and most pick up the book.  I have yet  to hear a negative comment about the book.  Instead the comments go like  this:  \\"Gosh, I remember that!\\" as one of my guests are transported in a  nostalgic time machine.  It has been a long time since I was as pleased  with any book as I have been with this one; I expect it will be a long time  before I will be please with another book.	1999-12-16

I LOVE Dave Barry.  Ever since I was in high school and read DAVE BARRY SLEPT HEAR: A SORT-OF HISTORY OF AMERICA, I have laughed until I hurt more than once reading his works.<br />That endorsement not withstanding, I was  dissappointed with this book.  In the preface Barry states he was advised  not to worry about the plot.  He was poorly advised.  Mind you, I was not  expecting Barry to produce something along the lines of Pride and Prejudice   I was expecting to read an extremely funny story.<br />While the book is  extremely funny, the story part has much to be desired.  It was an  admirable first attempt at a novel, yet it is nothing more than that--an  attempt. <br />Also the book contains what Barry terms as \\"Adult language.\\"   It contains A LOT of it.  More than most novels.  Like most televisions,  movies, books, and teenagers, the book would have been better served  without it.<br />Again, the book is very funny and in many ways mimicks his  column. So if you like Dave Barry's humor your going to like the book.   Just don't buy it in  hardback; wait for the paperback.  Or borrow it from  someone like the idiot i am who paid too much for it.	1999-12-10

Because I did not want to give half my  salary to fast food restaurants and eat from stryofoam for the rest of my  life, I decided I ought learned how to cook.  That is when I started  collecting cookbooks. I started with Cooking For Dummies and went on from  there.  I quickly found that I had a knack for cooking and soon came to  enjoy it.  As my cookbook collection grew, I quickly discovered that there  were two types of cookbooks:  Those you cook from and those you read.  This  is the first cookbook that I have found is good for both.  The recipes  included are fabulous and it is a great book to browse.  The recipes come  on all levels so the cooking klutzes and the Julia Childs alike will be  able to use it.  When you buy this book, and you certainly SHOULD buy this  book, go directly to the recipe for blondies.  I had never heard of them  before but they are cheap and easily made.  After I made the first batch, I  made a double batch to take to work where I had just started.  Let's just  say it made breaking the ice in a large office a lot easier.  Thanks, Ms.  Anderson!	1999-12-09

The list of the books faults are too numerous, but here are a few:    The characters  lacked dimension.  The outcome was predictible.  It was less a mystery than a tyrade on why  gays should be ordained.  I should have known better when Bishop Sponge's  book was so highly praised.	1999-12-06

This is one of the few books that I read over and over again.  Save yourself some money, and get a hardback editon.  This book is entertaining, funny, and can be read in one or two sittings.  If you are a fan of  Christian Fiction, this book should be at the top of your reading list.  If  Frank Peretti is your favorite author, this book will make him your second  favorite.	1999-10-13

Perhaps she has become bored with the McPherson  character.   Or prehaps she just wanted a venue to rant about the excesses  of liberal academia.  In either case, this book is best forgotton.  Sorry,  Sharron.	1999-10-05

What it does is call Christians to a liberal legalism.  While there are a few issues he gets right, the vast  majority he does not.  For example he advocates for &quot;celebate  homosexuals&quot; to live together in a sort of plutonic harmony.   Campolo  doesn't seem to feel this would give occasion to sin (he does comdemn the  homosexual lifestyle -- yet not as much as say, a Christian owning a BMW).   Or if he does he simply ignores the issue altogether.	1999-10-05
